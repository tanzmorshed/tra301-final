","A great adaptation of the source material makes for a very entertaining and violent ride. Begs the question, what would a superhero be like in real life? If you dig violent action and can handle a lot of profanity, this movie could be for you. Chloe Grace Moretz without question steals the show in this one."
"naiksrn","10","250","345","31 May 2010"," Surprisingly Good Movie
","I saw the previews for this and thought this was going to be one of those slapstick stupid comedy movies (Superbad, Super Hero Movie). I came on IMDb and saw the rating and the reviews and I thought I'd reconsider after doing some research on this. I was very wrong with my initial assessment. Yes, there's some teen comedic elements to this movie, but the movie flowed perfectly. Great Soundtrack, great fight scenes, acting was good, story was great and original. With a current IMDb rating of 8.3 as I write this, look's like I'm not alone on how I rated this movie. Show stealer was definitely Hit Girl. I foresee her having a huge career. Possibly the next Natalie Portman. Reminded me of Natalie's role in Leon. Which leads me to my next point. Unless you're into comic books, video games, in your teens/20's/30's and don't have a young kid, you might be taken aback that a little 11 year old girl is killing people and using bad words. For those that gave this a bad review because of that, do some research on a movie before you go see something that you think you won't like. I hate musicals and I'm not going to pay 10 bucks to see High School Musical and then come in here and complain that there was too much singing and dancing. It's clearly geared at a older teen/young adult audience and is rated R, what did you expect. In closing, one of the most entertaining films I've ever seen."

","It has been a long time since I have left a screening with endorphins pumping through my body and the strong urge to learn a martial art but Kick-Ass did exactly that; I felt like I could take on the world! An explosive ride that covers insane action sequences, intelligent superhero parodies and intense dramatic turns, Kick-Ass is a welcome addition to the realm of the comic-book movie.<br/><br/>I was initially sceptical about the prospect of watching another superhero spoof movie, most recent attempts at the genre have been abysmal, but Kick-Ass completely transcends its predecessors through the use of intelligent pastiche which drives the story forward as well as providing laughs. The brilliantly choreographed action scenes would not feel out of place in a Spiderman film, or even a Tarantino script, in fact it feels like Spiderman and Kill Bill were put into a blender and Kick-Ass was the end result.<br/><br/>The story focuses on Dave Lizewski, your average teenage nerd, whose obsession with comic books inspires him to create his very own superhero, Kick-Ass, despite his discernible lack of superpowers. Dave's attempts to become a vigilante crime fighter initially end in disaster but in the process of rescuing a cat his luck changes, propelling him into the public limelight and establishing him as a figure to be reckoned with.<br/><br/>It is not long before other vigilantes surface, some desperate for the fame and attention, others out for revenge, and when Kick-Ass becomes embroiled in a crime lords devious plans, we are treated to a number of intense melees that gradually escalate in size and repercussions for those involved. There has been some controversy over the graphic violence depicted in these scenes, especially as the trailer is intended to appeal to a fairly young audience, and that comes as no surprise when a pre-teen girl decapitates villains on screen and uses the c*** word. Controversy aside, I cannot deny that this was very entertaining.<br/><br/>Chloe Moretz easily steals the show as Hit Girl - the incredibly volatile young superhero with a penchant for explicit language, which will surely propel her into the realms of stardom. Nicolas Cage is surprisingly effective as her doting father, and Christopher Mintz-Plasse is ever watchable as Red Mist. However it is Aaron Johnson who shows the most promise as Kick-Ass, with his convincing turn from a bumbling student to a brave and reckless crime fighter marking him as a talent to watch out for.<br/><br/>An essential part of the film is its eclectic soundtrack, with choice tracks taken from excellent films such as 28 Days Later and For a few dollars more. Usually I would be concerned at such a prospect but the Kick-Ass soundtrack adapts the tracks brilliantly, making them feel like its own, alongside great songs from The Prodigy and Sparks to name a few. The choice of music fits perfectly with the high-octane action sequences and even adds emotional depth to key scenes - not bad for a superhero comedy movie! <br/><br/>Kick-Ass is that rarest of films, a successful hybrid of two genres that delivers an almost perfect cinematic experience. My only criticism would be that some sequences near the end were slightly far-fetched but in a film where suspension of belief is required, maybe I'm being a little harsh. This is an essential film for all cinema-goers, catch it on the big screen and I guarantee you will be completely immersed in the explosive yet entertaining world of Kick-Ass<br/><br/>9/10 <br/><br/>If you liked this film you will also enjoy these: <br/><br/>Special, Spiderman, The Dark Knight and Superbad"
"marxthedude","10","592","916","2 March 2010"," Gget ready for the new classic superhero movie!
","In a movie industry cluttered with own-grown hype, gimmicks and lack of idea, ""Kick Ass"" bursts onto the screen and shatters all expectations in it's wake. You're on this page because you think it's gonna be good? Wrong. Or you're here because you think it looks a decent or a good superhero movie to join the ranks of the ones you already love? DEAD wrong. Reason being, is ""Kick Ass""doesn't want to be good or above average, ""Kick Ass"" wants to be great and it has the balls to want to be original too. Seemingly impossible in a done to death genre where we've already glimpsed Mark Millar's signature style in ""Wanted"", but ""Kick Ass"" is all about the unexpected.<br/><br/>Make no mistake, nothing you believe of this movie compares to what Vaughn and co. serve up for you. Mainly because everyone involved seems determined to honour the comic and redefine a genre. Most movies entertain, but this one? It wants to BLOW YOU AWAY! Less smarter movies have done that but ""Kick Ass"" ain't giving that up either. It's script is razor-sharp, dumping the pretension of ""the burden of heroism"" crippling even the better superhero films, showing this in actions rather than long drawn out emoting. Matthew Vaughn has finally solved the hurdle that all superhero movies suffer, namely how to get to know and love your characters without long drawn out scenes. He does it by keeping them moving. The more they do, the more they try, the more you know and love them. And make the narrative interesting and most of all relatable so we're with Dave 100% of the way, it doesn't just have to functional.<br/><br/>The real visual joy of ""Kick Ass"" is it's desire to keep it simple but not at the expense of wowing us. Make characters do cool things, instead of Michael Bay-esquire things happening to them. That's why they exude coolness, despite Dave's almost humdrum existence. This is the everyman doing the things we could do if wanted to; not a guy from another reality or possessed with great drive and ambition. Dave wants to get laid. He wants to be hip. Even your bad guy in this is believable. Watching the whirlwind that is Hit Girl perform a routine almost straight out of Jackie Chan's Hong Kong days stuns us in a way no big screen chase ever could. Visually the film takes all the thing we DID love from the movies that ultimately didn't zing and churns them into a finely balanced flawless brew.<br/><br/>Did I mention it's feel good? From it's inspired use of music (again utterly relatable) right down to it's outstanding score, like ""Get Carter"" for superheroes; I could say more but there's surprises in store.<br/><br/>In a movie this stunning, acting is usually secondary (as any James Cameron film shows). Not a bit of it. In a cast as eclectic as the styles the film embraces you have performances that set a benchmark for all concerned. Can Mark Strong already better his stellar work? See his menacing and humorous turn as D'Amico, a career best. Christopher Mintz Plasse follows ""Role Models"" by breaking out of McLovin mode. His guy has layers and he can show them. Nicolas Cage as expected returns to his past glories playing larger than life eccentric characters but not without a little sadness too. Joining him is Chloe Moretz forever destined to be remembered for her first major role. She idolised Angelina Jolie apparently. Guess what, you trounced any action movie she has ever made! Moretz dominates any scenes she's in, no easy task considering her fellow cast! Aaron Johnson has the most difficult job of all. Being an original uber-geek after Michael Cera set the standard (anyone who's seen ""Zombieland"" knows it's hard to write an original geek even in a great movie). He shakes it, redefines it and OWNS it. He leads the movie like he wrote it, joined by a cast where even the smallest roles are fully fleshed out. It's quite an ensemble. A renegade band of acting styles forming a perfect one and complementing the film's fun style.<br/><br/>Watching ""Kick Ass"" is ultimately like being on a thrill-ride, it doesn't just want to dazzle you, it's wants to draw you in, ride the wave and leave the cinema on a high. And it doesn't do that with gimmicks or tried and tested formula's, it breaks the mold, shakes conventions and wants you to be surprised while complementing all the movies you already love. It's not just a movie, it's a standard, one that promises to prove movies like this can be written with great heart and brain.<br/><br/>And ultimately you'll be leaving the screen thinking ""Wow, let's do that again"" no matter how many agains come before it."
"pgtmatrix","10","389","610","16 April 2010"," KICK-ASS kicked my ass
","This is definitely the best movie of 2010 so far, hands down. Not only is it insanely funny throughout, it has a great story and in-your-face action that will (pun intended) kick your ass. <br/><br/>It's the story of a high school comic book nerd who decides he's going to take up being a costumed hero because no one else will. Early on he discovers that society could care less about the evils that be, and he takes it upon himself to do something about it. But of course none of the ""super heroes"" in the movie actually have powers, because it's about real people kicking real ass. Early on you'll find the protagonist, Dave, is a pushover and even as his costumed alter-ego, Kick-Ass, he can't succeed in anything he does. He comes off as an extremely unlikable character, but as the story unfolds and he gets mixed up with other costumed heroes who really do kick ass, he slowly becomes the perfect anti-hero and a character which will most likely be a new icon in popular culture. <br/><br/>The script for the film is remarkably well written and it managed to combine hilarious comedy with incredibly graphic, stylized violence. Never have I seen a movie that combined the two so well. One moment, you'll be crying from laughter and the next you'll be squinching at a little girl slaughtering grown men with the slightest of ease. <br/><br/>The directing was top-notch and this is the first film i've seen from Matthew Vaughn. If Kick-Ass doesn't put him on the map as one of the most sought after directors in Hollywood then I don't know what will.<br/><br/>The acting was superb from the entire cast, especially from veteran Nicolas Cage. He played his part perfectly and I couldn't see any one else as Big Daddy. As impressed as I was with Cage's performance, I was blown away with how well Chloe Moretz, Hit-Girl, played her part. She definitely stole the show.<br/><br/>I honestly couldn't recommend this movie more, and it has become one of my new personal favorites. Kick-Ass is a film about finding your identity and daring to do something no one else will. Yet it's also an intricate tale of revenge, which is masterfully crafted to be one of the most entertaining pieces of fiction I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. <br/><br/>10 out of 10"
"moitrayana","9","369","583","26 March 2010"," Superbad meets Kill Bill
","You know that rare feeling... happens every year or so... when you pour out of the cinema SO excited at the film you've just watched, and every other word is ""ohmygodilovedtwithbitwherethey""? Well 'Ding', Kick ass hits that sweet spot. Comprising teen comedy, kick-ass action (sorry) and a healthy dose of comic book style violence and gore, it rocks.<br/><br/>It's Superbad meets Kill Bill.<br/><br/>The film is a fairly faithful adaptation of the comic book, and where tweaks have been made, they make the plot more robust for the audience to empathise with.<br/><br/>Kick-ass is stylish, fun, daring, and the dark surprise of violence and gore kept the balance of comic teen angst fresh: a delicious perk me up when you were settling into comedy mode. There was never a dull moment in the pace of the film, never a flimsy plot point, and actually the audience guffawed their way through the film. Did I mention it has a cool soundtrack to boot? I've already got it on my Phone."
"V.I.D.I.O.T.","8","229","363","9 March 2010"," ""Spider-Man"" and ""Kill Bill"" had a baby and its head popped off!
","Last night my combined love of films and comic books finally paid dividends, as I was invited (along with every other comic manager in the Boston area) to attend a press screening of Marv films' ""Kick-Ass"" (based on Mark Millar & John Romita Jr's Marvel Comics series of the same name), which opens in theaters April 16th. A bold move on the part of Marv, considering they were risking a month of ""WERST MOVIE EVERRR!"" badmouthing across the entire state. I assure you that will not be a problem.<br/><br/>So first off, should you see this? Definitely. As I told everyone when ""Watchmen"" was out, if you are a fan of comic books, just go see the movie - if only to add yourself to the communal experience, to join the debate. Everyone's going to be talking about it anyway, don't get left behind. And in this case, I think it will be more universally enjoyed than ""Watchmen"". Not that it is a ""better"" film, just a lot more entertaining - it tries for far less, succeeds at what it attempts, and therefore hasn't left itself open to as much scrutiny. Bottom line, this is just a fun romp with clever bits and reassuringly satisfying plot points, that had a bunch of jaded comic geeks roaring with laughter and delight, rooting for the good guys, culminating with applause at the end. Granted, we were seeing it for free, and had nothing invested besides a night we could have otherwise been sitting at home playing Arkham Asylum. But even if discussion later turned to this-or-that subtle difference from the comic, I don't think many were picking apart plot holes or questionable directorial decisions.<br/><br/>Overall, the impression I was left with was that it was a kind of hybrid descendant of ""Spider-Man"" and ""Kill Bill"". It has its mundane real-world-kid-deals-with-real-life-situations side, as Peter-Parkerish ""nobody"" Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) dreams of something more than his boring humdrum teen life. Eventually, like most kids his age, he decides to make an impact on the world by... well, y'know, donning a super-suit and heading out to thwart evil-doers. Just as we're getting used to the idea that of course this won't work and that he'll get his ass kicked every time, he starts learning how to improve his chances, and also that he's not alone in his quest.<br/><br/>Which then brings us to the film's outrageous, over-the-top side, best exemplified by everyone's newest favorite comic book character, ""Hit-Girl"". Her operatic, homicidal spaghetti-western character is delivered with so much infectious glee that you could feel the entire theater perk up whenever she appeared. The fact that she is played by Chloe Moretz, an actress no older than the ""Planetary"" comic series, only adds to the overall delightfully ludicrous nature of her character. I'm sure there will be the inevitable stink raised by parental or religious groups, not so much at the well-deserved ""R"" rating, but at this particular character, a pre-teen Beatrix Kiddo and GoGo Yubari rolled into one.<br/><br/>To wrap up: I think the pacing is exemplary, there really weren't any dead spots for the audience to shift in their seats. Matthew Vaughn's direction neither dazzles nor bores, there is much that is derivative of previous films, but he knows how to build up and pay off an action scene, and there were moments I was sure how a scene was being set up to end, only to be pleasantly surprised at the result. I think my favorite aspect of the film was the use of music, from the use of John Murphy's building epic ""Sunshine"" and ""28 Days Later"" themes, to a hilarious ""that's just wrong"" use of the ""Banana Splits"" theme. It's possible that with a month to street date, we may have seen some temp music, but I hope not, everything fit perfectly - even Elvis Presley's ""America The Beautiful""! The casting works, from the relatively unknown Johnson (whose screen presence in this film is definitely enhanced by how much he looks like Tobey Maguire once he puts the ski mask on), to the quirky haunted Nicolas Cage (who for once forgoes his normal Presley-channeling in favor of some Pure West), to the mostly-British supporting players, made up of bits of cast from Vaughn's previous producing / directing gigs. And for the most part, the teens actually look like teens, not like the 25-year-olds that usually portray teens in film and TV. Christopher Mintz-Plasse (a.k.a. ""McLovin'"") especially stands out, in a role that sneakily grows into one of the most important and poignant of the film.<br/><br/>I had a blast, I think you will too. I know they've got a month to tinker around with the film, but I for one hope they don't change a frame. I think casual ""what's playing tonight"" audiences will enjoy an irreverent violent funny action flick, and comic fans will get an extra treat picking out all the comic book references in the background. I really can't imagine anyone anywhere watching ""Avatar"" had as much fun as we all had last night. I for one will be back, this time with money and peanut M&Ms in hand."
"claudio-domingues","10","190","305","7 July 2010"," Brilliant. Everything works perfectly in this amazing movie.
","Kick-ass tells the story of Dave, a common teenager without anything special about him. Through his sense of justice and some events he decides to become a ""Superhero"" and hardly tries to save innocent people.<br/><br/>Why did I like this movie so much? Well, that's not easy to explain. The acting was flawless (in my opinion) with Aaron (Dave/Kick-ass), Chloe (Hit-girl) and Christopher (Chris/Red Mist) giving their best and shining throughout the entire movie. The storyline, even though it may not be the most original one, is amazingly well developed. The movie goes by at a perfect rhythm, combining comedy with action just perfectly. The music was amazingly well picked and combined 100% with every scene. and so on and so forth...<br/><br/>When I left the theater I was so excited, so happy and so energetic, it looked like I just had a shot of adrenaline! And I couldn't stop talking about the movie. It's been a really long time since I felt this way about a movie.<br/><br/>Now I know this movie is going to feed a lot of haters. It's normal. A lot of people walk into the theater with their mind already set, like ""This movie is for nerds. It's going to suck so much."", if you have that kind of mentality just save yourself the time and don't watch it. Why bother if throughout the whole movie you're just going to be looking for flaws or rolling your eyes at every joke.<br/><br/>I loved this movie. I don't care about anything other people say. Kick- ass is my favorite movie of all time. I have no doubt about that."

The main character Kick-Ass is both comedic, quirky, and relatable (weather to yourself or someone you know) to anyone who's ever been to high school. His friends, also comedic, also will remind any guy of their own little group of three musketeers talking about movies, sports, comics and of coarse girls. The other heroes, such as Hit-Girl (who alone could provides the R rating) and Big-Daddy act as a total sub plot to the film that eventually mashes together with Kick-ass's story. They provide the majority of the REAL ASS KICKING. Also the characters actually get so connected with you that by the end you will actually feel and sympathize with the obstacles and tragedies they have to go through. Despite all the blood and violence there are some touching moments in this film.<br/><br/>In all, this movie rocked, it's not for kids, it'll blow your mind, the filming technique was great props to the director, the acting was good, the action was sweet, and the movie in total kicked some SERIOUS ASS!!!"

","When I first saw Kick Ass i was expecting more action than comedy. However, I was wrong with how surprisingly funny the movie turned out to be. I thought Hit Girl was what made the movie shine as she was cussing and slaughtering people. Aaron Johnson did a good job playing the lead role of Kick Ass and I thought Nicolas Cage was good at playing Big Daddy as it wasn't the typical Cage film. This movie beats a lot of those stupid high school movies and chick flicks that are trying to be funny but fail. This is a great combination of bloody action and comedy. Its the Super Bad meets Kill Bill genre. I highly recommend this film."

","Mark Millar whom started out in the British Comic Book industry, writing for 2000AD and Sonic the Comic has become one of the biggest comic book writers around, writing for Marvel and DC with major characters like Spider-man, X-Men, Wolverine and Superman, before being able to create his own comics. His first film adaptation was the weak, dumbed down version of the Matrix, Wanted: but luckily Kick-Ass is a lot better.<br/><br/>Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) is a typical New York teenager, who is a comic-book fan, and not in any particular group in High School. He is ignored by girls, including Katie (Lyndsy Fonseca), the girl he fancies. Dave however fantasises about what it would be like to be a superhero and he makes an effort to make it happen. After his first attempt at vigilante justice Dave ends up having a big accident and his nerve endings are damage. But this gives him a high pain threshold and after being videotaped fighting three men at once Dave becomes a internet sensation and his alter-ego, Kick-Ass is born. But Dave as Kick-Ass gets in over his head when he meets two real heroes, Big Daddy (Nicholas Cage), and his young girl Hit-Girl (Chloe Moretz), a brilliant martial artist and skilled assassin. Big Daddy sets out to bring down the crime lord Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong), taking down his organisation from the bottom up. As Kick-Ass Dave is brought into their violence world. As well as these superhero actives Dave has to hide his identity, whilst using his fame in the internet age to help people out through Myspace. He also finally get's Katie's attentions, but for all the wrong reasons.<br/><br/>The director Matthew Vaughn had been touted to direct comic book conversions before. He was offered the chance to do X-Men: The Last Stand but left because of the rushed production and weak script, and missed out on directing Thor when his script turned out would have cost too much. He has proved to be a skilled director, having done the great gangster film Layer Cake and the fun fantasy romp Stardust. With Kick-Ass he is able to make a stylist, colourful comic-book conversion. It is fast-paced, action-packed, violence and very funny throughout. Vaughn was able to make a live action comic, with stylist vision trick, compared to Ang Lee who tried and failed with Hulk. An excellent film in vain of Frank Miller films like Sin City and 300. Vaughn shows how an action sequence should be directed, with Hit-Girl and her wide range of weapons making excellent viewing. Vaughn made the film like a violence parody of Spider-man, following similar plot elements, scenes like Dave designing his costume, having a similar score and basically plays on wider superhero conventions. But this was a parody which pays tribute and respects the genre it's lampooning, not aiming for cheap laughs.<br/><br/>Aaron Johnson offers an excellent performance as Dave/Kick-Ass. He is like Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker, going through similar issues, using a voice-over throughout the film, and even sounds like Maguire. He is an actor with a bright future ahead of him. Vaughn is able to assemble a good supporting cast. Nicholas Cage is a known superhero fan and he missed out playing both Iron Man and Superman in the past. He is excellent as the man of action as Big Daddy, and is a deranged but loving father. He is one an important quest to take down Frank D'Amico. Mark Strong has been making headway in Hollywood recently, being in films like Body of Lies and Sherlock Holmes. He plays an effective villain, a gangster slowly becoming more violence and erratic because of the Kick-Ass phenomenon. He too is a deranged and loving father despite his business. But the real star out of the supporting actors is Chloe Moretz as the foul month 11-year-old assassin who is hard as nails, but also at times a sweet-natured girl and it is wonderfully played when the two characteristics are compared. She is one of the most fun characters in a film this year.<br/><br/>Kick-Ass is not perfect, and it will not cater to everyone's tastes, but it is easily one of the most fun films of 2010."

","I thought the idea of Kick Ass - everyday teens transforming themselves into superheroes to fight crime – looked like great fun. The ads looked promising too. As for the film itself, it was not lacking in skill, humour or inspiration, and it had some great performances to showcase.<br/><br/>However, the violence here (""casual slaughter"" is a better term for it) was repugnant in its aim to excite and delight, and more than a little disturbing to watch as the audience hoots along with each 'kill'. Movies can be a great communal experience, but I can't recall a cinema experience where I have felt so depressingly cut off from my fellow human beings (a generous use of the term).<br/><br/>I suppose we are supposed to applaud the audaciousness and black comedy of a preteen girl slicing off bad men's legs and shooting them through the head, but to me it reeked of filmmakers desperately trying to find new and novel ways to hype audiences up. Of course, they framed the carnage unconvincingly around a 'perhaps the heroes are as sociopathic as the villains' theme, lest anyone dare question their motives. (Reminds me of Terminator 2's banal anti-violence message.) Oh yes, those baddies were bad, but, for instance, I wondered how families affected by suicide might have felt as audiences cheered on Hit Girl as she forces a bad guy to shoot himself through the head. Oh, but I'm missing the point, I guess The sad thing is that Kick Ass could have achieved its thematic aims without the graphic carnage. However, I doubt this approach would not have brought director Matthew Vaughan and writer Jane Goldman quite the level of attention they would appear to crave.<br/><br/>It's well time that Oliver Stone made Natural Born Killers 2 in order to provide another perceptive and unflattering mirror to an increasingly apathetic and sensation-focused society.<br/><br/>P.S. some hopeful newssome Australian film critics/commentators such as David Stratton, Tom Ryan and Richard Wilkins have publicly denounced the violence in the film. Thank you guysyou've already copped some ridicule for this, but at least some people are drawing the line, as well as seeing through the 'hipness'."

","I'm really starting to loose faith in the American audience. While the premise of this film is very promising, this movie is absolute garbage. Kick Ass fails because the movie doesn't know what it wants to to be. Is it supposed to be a comedy with action, or an action movie with comedy? The answer to that question, however, is that it is neither. The movie fails because it tries to be both and ends up ruining the basic elements of either genre. The parts that were supposed to be cool were mixed in with comedy that completely resets the tone. I'm not saying that action movies cannot have funny parts, but the way in which this movie does it is all wrong. I can say so many bad things about this movie, but then I would end up writing a book. <br/><br/>I'll leave it at this. Kick Ass is not only overrated, but it is also complete garbage. While watching this movie, I never found myself laughing because it felt almost out of place to laugh. If this film was meant to be a comedy, then I say that it took itself way too seriously. And if this movies was supposed to be an action movie, then it ruined all the cool stuff by adding humor at the worst possible moments. It makes me mad that people actually like this film. I believe in giving credit where credit is due, but this movie definitely does not deserve the critical acclaim that it's getting."
"zimm44","1","127","251","18 April 2010"," Very Surprised!
","Either we live in the world where a skillful marketing can make everyone's mind about the movie and sell it or... I don't know! <br/><br/>With quite interesting idea in its sleeve (a kid with no power becomes a 'superhero') the movie turns out to be a complete disaster. It's repetitive, boring, not that funny at all, has no likable characters (just psychos, dumb teens and even more dumb and psychotic 'villains') and is completely inconsistent in its form. <br/><br/>The idea is to put lots of typical clichés from different genres (teen comedies like American Pie, buddy movies, bloody revenge movies) and rip-offs from other comic-books (Batman, Spiderman, Punisher and even Iron Man) and put everything into a bag of movie sh.. as the main focus is to pack the sliced and incoherent story with never-ending bloody fight and torture scenes involving a kid stabbing, slicing and crushing people. <br/><br/>Hit Girl is stealing the show, right!?<br/><br/>It's like telling a 3-year-old to say 'F..k' and laughing because it sounds sooo funny. Then maybe he or she can kill a cat with a knife because you don't often see many 3-year-olds doing such a thing. The wise producers could do another popcorn flick set in primary school about kids killing Nazis and necrophiliacs. Sure they've never ever done that before! But should they! Is it really that funny for general audience nowadays? <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. I have nothing against violence in movies if it has SOME point to the story or even if it's nicely stylized (Sin City, 300). But in times of Saws the sickening violence has no other point apart from 'pleasing the audience' and Kick-Ass might be at the top of this statement. It can really make someone feel that comic books are worthless, pointless and derivative piece of crap that base their originality on pushing the boundaries in showing the violence rather than coming up with some decent storytelling. Kick Ass is as funny as interesting. Simply awful."

However this means that the only audience who would put up with the flaws and holes in this ""movie"" are too young to see it!<br/><br/>Hundreds of Clichés and stolen lines from far greater movies are found in abundance, from the robbing of the classic Scarface line ""Say hello to my little friend!"" to the typical ""guy gets girl"" tripe that seems so frequent in movies nowadays.<br/><br/>None of the Super Heroes featured in this ""movie"" have any special powers but are more based on the Batman style of crime fighter. A vital plot flaw that is called into question when ""Hit Girl""(the 11 year old foul mouthed ""super hero"") has a one-on-one fight with the big boss man and he kicks her very hard in the face. She pretty much shakes it straight off as if it was nothing. If a young girl got kicked like that for real straight in the face she'd more likely be dead or in traction with injuries instead of just having a bloody nose. Further on in this unbelievable fight sequence she gets thrown into a solid table with such force that it breaks yet she still remains conscious.<br/><br/>If you like watching badly acted, flawed abominations that call themselves ""movies"" than this will be right up your street.<br/><br/>If however you actually have a brain or can't stand child exploitation for cheap ""laughs"" you'd probably rather kick your own ass than watch this ""movie""!"

","Alright, so I went to this movie knowing very little about it. I saw the trailer featuring a young girl cursing while wearing a superhero costume and wondered what the rest of the movie could possibly be about. Fortunately, I left the movie thinking the exact same thing! What was that movie about?! I enjoyed the beginning storyline of a teenage misfit fighting for what is just and right in society. I honestly wish it stuck to this storyline. Then, he falls in love with a character added simply for her good looks as she had no other additions to the movie. He gets into a fight with some henchmen for some coke dealer (a.k.a. McLovin's dad) and gets brutally beaten for the third time. Then Nick Cage and young girl come out of nowhere and begin their role in the movie. The movie went downhill from here. It went from a kid simply trying to correct the wrongs of society to a group of heroes killing people to avenge the death of Nick's wife. It was funny at parts, sad at others, and funny/sad at the same time (not in a good way.) There were a few parts where I felt awkward just sitting there. Was this part funny? Do I feel bad for laughing? It honestly felt like two different writers got together without talking about what each person was writing and made a film. First guy said, ""heroic teenager redeems the good qualities of society."" Second guy said, ""murderous preteen girl avenges her mothers death by killing cocaine kingpins."" Third guy in the corner, ""How in the world can we tie those together?!"" GOOD THINKING THIRD GUY."

","I do remember hearing about KICK ASS on its release but for some inexplicable reason never got round to watching it until it was shown on Channel 4 tonight . I do recall it caused a bit of a stir along the lines of being a little bit violent but hey vigilante wannabes giving a few slaps to bad guys means we're not watching Walt Disney but did have the impression it was going to be a good natured movie that possibly the whole family could enjoy . I have totally embarrassed myself typing that last line and should have listened to the channel 4 announcer warn of violence , strong language and scenes some viewers might find offensive <br/><br/>What we have is John Woo meets Quintan Tarantino meets Hollywood obsession with comic book heroes and this isn't really a criticism but it does indicate that this is certainly not the family friendly fare I thought I might have been watching . It does have a good natured premise ripe for all types of dark humour where Dave Lizewski a gauche New York teenager suffering from existentialist angst decides he's had enough of being a nobody and decides to take on the criminal underworld as "" Kick Ass "" a real life superhero who is going to live up to his name<br/><br/>This is how the early parts of the film play out and is blackly comical as Kick Ass has a quixotic plan to clean up the streets . Try and think of TAXI DRIVER where Scorsese cast a happy clappy Christian youth as Travis Bickle and you're on the right tracks . The amusing tone of the film then changes as we're introduced to Hit Girl a pre-pubescent child who spends much of the film dispatching bad guys in a variety of graphic ways . Let's be honest here if she was in her early 20s and played by Megan Fox no one would have blinked an eyelid and if we were to be even more honest she'd be some sort of masturbatory fantasy figure but because the character is eleven years old that changes the whole game and watching Hit Girl jump around in the style of THE MATRIX literally slicing and dicing gangsters does make for uncomfortable viewing and some cynics might say she is included to stir up controversy <br/><br/>Matthew Vaughn proves himself as one of the most interesting directors and if you want to say that he's more style than substance then I won't disagree with you but will defend him on the grounds that if you're this talented when it comes to style who needs any substance . Like his earlier film LAYER CAKE there's a danger of the whole film collapsing in to one big bad mess but is directed with such directorial flourish this never happens . He does help his cause by including a great soundtrack and might be seen as a cheap trick but is very effective <br/><br/>KICK ASS is a very enjoyable film for those in the mood for some stylish designer violence but I should emphasise it is a violent film and the fact that much of the violence is tongue in cheek might ironically alienate audience members more than it might have done if everything had been played in a slightly more serious way , but there's an energy here rarely seen in other films featuring vigilantes and superheroes"

If your into superhero movies and want to check something new out. this is it. The story alone makes the movie all that much better. A lot of action movies either have to much action and not a good story or very little action and a good story. Kick Ass has both the action and the great story.

","I registered here to review this film, as I believe the high rating it has is a result of manipulation. I went to the cinema to see this after checking out the reviews here, and it has irreparrably damaged my confidence in IMDb. . . <br/><br/>It is clear that the review system is being manipulated to give UTTER TRASH like this high ratings on IMDb. <br/><br/>CHILD EXPLOITATION<br/><br/>I suppose if you're a Hollywood producer backed by enough money to market your product, you can exploit children in your film. You can also assist in the progressive de-sensitization of the masses to violence and pretend to be provocative and original by getting your child actress to act out scenes of murder and extreme violence. You can do all this and still get rave reviews in the mainstream media , who are getting payed by your bosses, so who cares about human values anymore? People who find this film funny, or good in any way have some serious problems, in my opinion. This is like a bunch of retarded, coked-up teenagers with lots of cash to burn trying to be as awful as Tarantino in his worse moments. If you think this would be funny somehow, you are mistaken. This juvenile, onanistic sh!t is like the worse straight-to-DVD American trash you can pick up for a buck in junk stores. <br/><br/>The facts : this film is marketed to young people; has received rave reviews and has not been utterly condemned for its abusive, criminal exploitation of the worse parts of human nature and Amerikanised trash ""culture"" . Pretty depressing, and this has lots to say about the hopelessness of our ""civilisation"". It's funny if you have the humour of a sociopathic 13-year old boy from New Jersey. And it is precisely this demographic that should be kept away from films like this at all costs.<br/><br/>Hollywood continues with its campaign to completely erode humane values and de-sensitize people to violence and torture. How come full-on sex scenes including genitals are taboo, but scenes of gory murder and torture are now so commonplace that even children can participate? How did we get here? <br/><br/>Thugggish violence and shootings in schools by under-age psychopaths can be expected to continue with increased regularity thanks to films like this. Violence and torture are funny, yeah , as funny as a full-force baseball-bat hit to your genitals. <br/><br/>Like another reviewer has said: AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE"
"Silver_Fire-715-180021","3","105","212","17 April 2010"," G-rated material, R-rated delivery.
","Seeing the commercials for this movie in theaters I was interested to see how things would go, yet skeptical about how well it would turn out in the end. Tonight pretty much gave me that answer.<br/><br/>In the beginning it was exciting to know that this average, nerdy, unnoticed kid was eventually going to wind up as this crime-fighting superhero somewhere further into the story - rather than to find out that, somewhere further into the story, he was still an average, nerdy, semi-noticed kid. With a costume.<br/><br/>My first problem with this movie (there are many, sadly...) is that it's supposed to be a comedy. That's what they aimed for, right? Or did I miss something? I think the only time I truly laughed was at the beginning before the movie even took pace. After that, I was feeling a little caught in between something along the lines of Scary Movie with a violent twist that could put most horror movies to go wallow in a bloodbath of shame. In my opinion, comedies are there to make us go, ""Haha! That guy just slipped on a banana peal!"" (Okay, totally old-fashioned, I know. Just stay with me here) And not, ""Haha! That little 12 year old girl just sliced that guy's leg off with a sword, shot twenty people through the forehead and crushed that man in a wrecking-yard car compactor!"" Horror and Comedy are something I prefer to see with a LITTLE distance between them, thank you. Having to laugh after a slaughter just seems like too much of a switch. Half of the time- no, pretty much the whole time, I was being torn between when or if I should giggle or cover my eyes at the gruesome sight on the screen. Everything just felt too mixed up and shaken around for my likes. Kind of like watching one of the Wiggles put on a hockey mask and start slashing people. Which is shameful to say. I myself am ashamed to even put it like that.<br/><br/>Another problem I had with this movie was pretty much the story itself. There really is no background to this wannabe-superhero other than what you see at the beginning. He's nerdy, and weak. It would have been nice to see one of those (real) superhero movie moments where the character goes into depression and is torn between right and wrong and gives the audience a break to see who this character actually is when he isn't killing people in the name of justice. Where he goes everyday, who he talks to, his family and public life. But honestly, the only thing you seem to see after a while is just the action and nothing more. The movie gets a little shallow...<br/><br/>But overall, Kick-Ass himself eventually seemed to get put on the back burner. Hit-Girl, the little 12 year old assassin, stole the show. I have to admit she really entertained me (I'm going against everything I just said about her, yes. And only because she has some really cool moves) and is easily the character I remember the most. Because who doesn't like a skilled assassin taking charge and kicking some bad-guy butt now and then? Even if she IS 12.<br/><br/>How did this review get so long? Well I'll finish up by giving some credit to the amazing and disturbingly bloody fight scenes which were fantastically choreographed and were certainly kick-ass to say the least. If there is a sequel, it will probably have more potential than the first film, and I would even go see it for myself despite this review; since for some reason I started to develop some fond memories about the movie about an hour after I left as opposed to leaving it with my face portraying someone who just got very disappointed. Maybe that's why everyone else liked it so much? Cool trick.<br/><br/>Final score: 3/10. Sadly the jumble of violence and chaos mixed in with parody-style comedy was just too much of a mix for me to give it any more than that in the end, and all my credit goes to the action scenes. Thank you for reading!"

Unsurprisingly this does not work and makes for uncomfortable watching as she stabs, slashes and has her face repeatedly punched by a full-grown man. Personally I found slightly this uncomfortable watching, gimmicky and not entertaining."

","I hardly ever post a full review on this site. But this movie is getting WAY too many good reviews.<br/><br/>Let me start by saying that I'm in my early twenties and I don't have children. So I wasn't bothered by the profanity, or the violence. It was the complete pointlessness of the profanity and violence that bothered me. <br/><br/>This movie never knew which way it wanted to go. I don't think a film needs to keep the same tone throughout... but there should be a natural progression from one theme to the next. This movie tried to be everything all at once. Eventually I just stopped caring about the characters and the story altogether... which didn't make any difference, because the movie was so predictable, anyways.<br/><br/>The acting was mediocre (and yes, that includes Nic Cage, who played the only interesting character) and the dialog was just plain dull. The only gut-laughs came from a few comic/movie references, and some ridiculous, over top sight gags that don't really work.<br/><br/>So, despite what the commercials say, you actually DON'T have to see this movie. Instead, you should rent A Clockwork Orange or Kill Bill Volume 2, and see how violence and profanity can be used as a powerful storytelling device. This movie is just another vehicle for over-choreographed, slow-motion, super-stylized, ""300""style dance-fighting with techno music in the background. There is nothing original about it."

"thelemoncircus","1","33","60","28 May 2010"," This Movie was NOT and NEVER will be a superhero Movie
","I gave it a 1 out of 10 because I rated it as a Superhero movie. If it was rated as a gory blood fest with killings and guts etc then maybe I'd give it a 2.<br/><br/>If you are a 15 year old - or somehow haven't matured enough in your 20's or 30's and still listen to Zane Lowe on radio 1 for your next CD to buy - then maybe it is for you. I hasten to add that even when I was 15 - I would need not only to have gone back in time but changed my entire physical self to some kind of moron that confuses a superhero movie with a dark comedy about gangsters with 'American Pie' characters. Just for the record when I was 15, 'Weird Science' was my best film.<br/><br/>Let's get one thing straight before we begin - I love comics, the smell they have, how you hold them - the very look and experience of the fantasy and the magic. I understood why a teenager would want to be a superhero - so the movie starts with a good premise - but remains in a world void of that spirit. Give me Superman, Spiderman, Batman any day. It's fun - the comic book experience. It was NEVER about engaging with the readers to make them feel ill. It was never about offending sensitivities. It was about good overcoming evil. Simple. Check the ticket returns for a real superhero movie Vs 'this attempt'.<br/><br/>I really felt that this movie insulted the genre of superhero films. If you wanted comedy - watch 'Mystery Men' - keeps the same dreams with misfit characters. This movie is violent just for the sake of pulling itself through each and every sordid scene. Luckily it sits by itself unable to be bench marked. I haven't logged into my IMDb account in such a long time, but felt it necessary to counter the positive reviews. Sorry! I needed to shout to anyone mature enough who enjoys comic adaptations (and yes I can see the oxymoron 'Mature = Comics') to make a reasoned judgement about watching this ""piece of filth"". I know that sounds like I work for the Daily Mail, but for the sake of freedom of expression - I would stop no one who wants to genuinely sit through this - then fine, but for perhaps parents who have children almost the age of Hit Girl say 11, and thinking her use of salty language is funny - forget it. If my daughter spoke like that I would be mortified - it's just not funny or cool or anything.<br/><br/>This - people belongs on the top shelf with other adult publications - not comics. It's like the Viz comic, but no where near as funny. It's marketed and aimed at young adults (which of course will include school children) and it is definitely not suitable for them. This picture is sick and twisted and no impressionable youngsters should be viewing these images. Hollywood has an open weeping sore. It's not well. Another symptom of our fallen social morals. We think this is cool? Really? God help us all."

"Animation Wizard","1","73","145","16 April 2010"," Why Kick Ass hurts artists
","Kick Ass came out over the weekend and its getting rave reviews from hundreds of papers and online magazines. I see "" AMAZING!"" and "" HIGH OCTANE ENERGY!"" amid pictures of AWESOME caped crusaders punching their way through the film's title on posters popping up everywhere.<br/><br/>However, until about two weeks ago I had never even heard of the thing. Kick Ass apparently came from a comic book published a handful of years ago by Marvel. Just one of thousands of titles the publishing company knocks out every year.<br/><br/>Kick Ass is one of those "" I'm so smart"" satires of the comic book world of characters. They try to create a world where one can simultaneously mock and love people who dress up like Batman or Superman. Where putting a ski mask over your head and fighting evil is both COOL and HILARIOUSLY stupid.<br/><br/>There's an off putting idea out there that if you exist in a world that some people don't understand ( i.e. you draw comics for a living and people mock you) then you must work tirelessly to make them 'understand' where you're coming from. As if you can only be complete in the world where the 'clique' of society, the Pulitzer people, the Paris Hilton groupies, the Times Magazine crowd accepts you as one of their own. If Times Magazine doesn't understand you then there must be something wrong with you! Right? Right? Wrong.<br/><br/>Artists don't need to be understood. Comic artists know that the people who read Oprah Book club novellas do not pick up the latest issues of Batman. Its common knowledge so why do artists continue to tirelessly create something that Oprah will approve of? I don't know but Kick Ass is exactly that.<br/><br/>Satires like Kick Ass are written from the 'wink wink I think comics are dumb too' position. They feed the idea that we're ALL in the same boat of believing that Batman is a hopelessly stupid character and none of us buy his comics. We're cool, just like you. We wrote this book to prove it.<br/><br/>To impound the idea that they're stupid they exaggerate the medium to the point of grotesque mimicry. Such as creating an eleven year old girl character who kills so many people over the course of the story that the only way to make her character seem more alive is to have her use such foul language that even the most perverted pervert in the audience will throw back his head, point at the screen (book) and shout, "" Can you BELIEVE she just said that?!"" What is the point? The only people who truly like this film are the artists in our community who feel the need to be part of the 'It crowd' ( Yeah, comics are so dumb! I don't know why I do that for a living!), the reviewers who want to mock graphic novels because they can't understand visual arts ( 'Comics are for kids. You really do that for a living?') and the poor people in the middle who can't tell the difference ( Whoa! It was awesome! I liked it when that kid stabbed that guy in the guy and ripped out his beating heart!).<br/><br/>The problem with Kick Ass is that for the thousands, probably millions of people who had no idea what Kick Ass was a month ago, they will see a film where an eleven year old murders people without restraint or second thought. It doesn't matter that the people she kills are depicted as evil. A 24 year old good being killed by a little girl is not cool. Its tragic. Usually its depicted as tragic if its depicted at all.<br/><br/>People will go away with the thought that this blatant, violent, foul mouthed mess of a film came from a comic book. Some people will be misguided enough to bring their kids, thanks to the stylized posters that look much more family friendly then they are, and they will leave the theater in absolute shock, dragging their kids with them. And those parents who probably never bought their child a comic book before will now never EVER buy them a comic.<br/><br/>Films like Kick Ass just play into the media's description that comics are evil, stupid and perverse and, most horribly, all the same.<br/><br/>What a mess."

Technically, it is excellent. It does have some holes and inconsistencies in the story. There were a couple of plot twists and deus ex machinas that you could see coming from a mile away, and/or were a bit much to take, but that's par for the course with films such as this. <br/><br/>A lot has been made of the character of ""Hit Girl,"" played by Chloë Grace Moretz, and for good reason. She's the reason that ""Kick Ass"" is groundbreaking, in its way--not necessarily a good, way, IMHO. We have a character, an eleven or twelve year old girl, who proficiently, sadistically and graphically kills people, with smiles and taunts, and graphic profanity. It's safe to say that she's responsible for the vast majority of of the film's prolific body count.<br/><br/>Take a kiddie/teen tongue in cheek fantasy/adventure film. Add a heavy dose of Scorsese-style profanity and Mob themes, along with Tarantino-style graphic, splattering gore, spurting blood, and dismemberment, and you've got ""Kick Ass."" <br/><br/>It's far more violent and gory than ""The Dark Night,"" either ""Hulk"" movie, either of the two ""Spiderman"" movies that I've seen, or for that matter, any of the other superhero movies that I remember. In another time, and not long ago, no one under the age of sixteen would/should have been allowed anywhere near it. But this movie has demonstrated--emphatically-- that just about anything regarding violence and gore goes as far as getting young people into theaters these days.<br/><br/>I want to take nothing from Chloë Grace Moretz; she's likely a superstar in the making. There are very few other actors her age that could have made such a character as hers work, but she pulls it off brilliantly, and as believably as could have possibly been done (even though most or all of the martial arts/bullet dodging/gun fighting feats that her character performs are absurd even for this genre of film). She strikes me like Dakota Fanning or Jurnee Smollett, the amazing young actress in ""Eve's Bayou."" They're those very young actors who--at least regarding the acting craft--each seem to carry very old and world wise souls inside their child's bodies. <br/><br/>But I can't help but be given pause regarding how far we've come (or regressed) as a society when a sadistic child assassin (who among other things in the movie, pursues and then murders a fleeing, unarmed woman) is one of the ""heroes"" of a top grossing film, to all of these effusively approving reviews. I suppose the saving grace is that practically all of the people that she kills are scumbags.<br/><br/>As a person of the male gender, I have no problem with woman characters who kick butt as well as or better than any man--quite the opposite. But this was not quite the same. <br/><br/>If the film had been more serious about what made Mindy/Hit-Girl tick, and emphasized the context of her as someone profoundly screwed up, and the product of a profoundly screwed up life experience (there are some things in her past that it alludes to that much more could/should have been done with), then it would have been far more compelling and defensible--I'm particularly thinking of ""Let The Right One In"". Instead, what is emphasized is the violence that she metes out--the thrills of her stylized, computer enhanced, artfully choreographed acrobatics and battle scenes and killing. That, in the view of the makers of the film, is apparently all that the demographic that they were aiming at is interested in (and unfortunately, they're likely right). <br/><br/>In that regard, I think the biggest stretch of all was toward the end. That after having faced--and decimated--a roomful of mobsters shooting at her (on two separate occasions) along with everything else that she's been through, she enters school, on the verge of interacting and socializing with people her own age for the first time in her life, and apparently just carries on like any normal girl (though she beats up the two inevitable bullies who demand her lunch money). Huh?!?! <br/><br/>I'm sure that even now someone, licking their chops at the prospect of matching or surpassing the box office receipts that ""Kick Ass"" has brought in, is probably thinking of how to top this, and is working on a pitch for the next rendition of this film genre.<br/><br/>What's next? With CGI these days, anyone, even an infant or toddler, can be transformed, on screen, into a near indestructible martial arts master and firearms expert mass-killer uber-assassin. <br/><br/>Will we witness, in the next movie, profanity shouting five and six year old killers? Or two year old toddlers mowing down and slicing apart crowds of people with machine guns from their strollers while yelling the ""c"" word? In the context of a film designed to get laughs?<br/><br/>I think ""Kick-Ass"" is worth seeing, if only because of its role as a landmark where the line of what is acceptable to us as a society has been pushed, irrevocably, ever further. I just don't share the opinion of some of the people on this site who consider it a transcendent masterpiece, yet it is definitely not boring. <br/><br/>But I have very mixed, even foreboding feelings about the experience."

","I am horrified from the stupidity of that movie. It should be genre: fantasy, manga or parody. It is not an action or crime, its just a joke with the movie industry. How can someone get profit from this. First - the fight scenes are totally unrealistic (specially fight scenes with Mindy... ) ; Second - were is the moral of the movie? To rebel? Not to watch the injustice but to operate? No, its just a one of these movies which are made to earn money from fans ... Third- if you want to watch a good comics based movie, which has realistic fight scenes, moral and truth about our status quo you have to watch ""Defendor"". Im just a big fan of cinema and thats why i don't like lose my time with such a thing. Btw- Im not happy about that, but Nicolas Cage for the last time shows that his star is waning...

","Kick Ass is a comic book adaptation of a geeky teenager who sets out to become a real life superhero.

"gigan-92","10","20","36","26 August 2010"," Holy $hit!!!
","Well, holy $hit!! I'm in love with this film, the whole genre of more realistic and more graphic hero films set in motion by ""The Dark Knight"". Howver, this one revolves more around the teen style seen in ""Spider-Man"" so to speak. But in a more graphic and brutal manner you've got to love. I'm whole heartedly surprised that such a comic existed but I'm glad that it does and even more glad the film was theatrically released and just as brutal.<br/><br/>The cast is so vibrant and the choices could not have been better. Aaron Johnson as our title character, he does a superb job portraying the average American kid. There is no ""I will avenge you!!"" or ""radioactive spiders"", but he wants to be a hero simply because its cool. Who hasn't? The story takes that concept and somewhat expands it and what you get is a an awesome and original story for once. Chris Mintz-Plasse is casted as Red Mist, who is the son of our main antagonist (Mark Strong). He couldn't be more hilarious and yet an obviously conflicted character, facing the choice of justice and his father's praised life of sin. Nicolas Cage is finally in a role in which I actually like his character. Recently I've been finding reasons to hate him. What a redemption!! Got to love the constant in-joke of his out fit's resemblance to Batman's, but a true fan knows otherwise. It's all in good fun.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most talked about character and my personal favorite is Hit Girl, played by Chloe Mortez. For such a young actress she has plenty of spice and I'm beyond impressed. Often her lines are far too vulgar for this review to quote but buy the DVD because it is on sale already if you didn't know.Far beyond comic relief though, Mortez is the ultimate bad-ass. The character has an air of intensity that oddly flows with her frail and deceptively weak appearance. The movie spares no profane word and the action is just the way I like it the most: gruesome. the drama is well-payed and the humor fits in quite well. You quickly find yourself caring dearly for these characters and will enjoy every second of them. Comical yet so close to reality, and yet so bold and unique. One thing I also must say is that the choice of music is just phenomenal. ""Kick-Ass"" takes the super hero genre and blends it with realism seen rarely in this genre of movies. A well put together masterpiece really.<br/><br/>See it. Love it. =]<br/><br/>""Switch to KRYPTONITE!!"" A+"

","When I first saw the trailer for Kick-Ass I wrongly predicted that it was going to bomb both critically and at the box office. Boy, how wrong I was. First of all, I am not going to preach about the over the top violence in this movie and how it is destructive to our society. However, I am going to say that when I wasted by 10 bucks to see this movie I was thoroughly disgusted by my fellow movie goers for liking this movie. If you are looking for a Tarantino style in this movie, you are not going to get it. There is nothing witty in the plot or the dialogue in this entire movie. It all boils down to the almost sadistic desire to show for example an 11 year old cutting off a man's legs and then yelling ""cool"" while you shake your head in dismay as the audience goes wild. This movie doesn't have a shred of intellect present in it and it made me wonder if this movie was genuinely marketed for tween audience who sneak into R rated movies."
"jason24691","9","8","12","28 March 2012"," This film kicks ass
","Watching the trailer to this film i thought to myself, nah its just another teen comic film, think again people this have got to be one of the all time classic films comic/action and its definitely not for kids, really, someone burns to death alive, also another hapless victim is cooked alive in a giant microwave, plus very bloody fight scenes.<br/><br/>The film is called kick ass, but its not all about him, its also about Big daddy (not the former British wrestler) and hit girl, they want to get revenge for the death of their wife/mother. <br/><br/>With great music to go with the superb action scenes, this is a film in which i highly recommend, you will not be disappointed."
"NoArrow","4","44","90","18 April 2010"," I hated this movie
","I can see how ""Kick-Ass"" is gonna be popular...but, then, I can see how ""Transformers 2"" could be popular, too. Now that that's out of the way...<br/><br/>If you're someone who thinks it might be a lark to watch an 11-year-old corner a defenceless woman and stab her twice through the chest, this movie might be for you. There's also a scene where she puts a guy in a trash compactor and we watch for a couple minutes as he's squished to death. The guy wasn't a character before this scene (and I don't remember what relevance he has to the movie), so we're not watching the payoff to a joke, we're just watching...a guy getting squished by a trash compactor. The brutality of the scene is immediately undercut with the 11-year-old employing some nasty profanity, an easy joke that'll get an immediate reaction, doing away with the conflict I imagine (hope?) a lot of the audience will be feeling after the scene that preceded it.<br/><br/>The premise is: real people trying to be super-heroes (not a bad idea - I liked it in ""The Dark Knight""). Dave is a comic book geek modelled, I assume, on most of the movie's target audience. He actually bears a closer resemblance to a Michael Cera hero, but, I'll get to that later. Anyway, he likes comic books, he decides to start ""fighting crime"" (which is always just around the corner in these movies) so he orders a suit and goes at it. He's not very good, and his friends make fun of him for the idea.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, an ex-cop (Nicolas Cage - very good) is turning his young daughter (the 11-year-old) into a cold-blooded killer, for our benefit. They're playing out a revenge scheme against the movie's chief villain, a mob boss played by Mark Strong. The plot in this movie sometimes feels like math: setup + action = payoff. Actually, that's exactly what it feels like. It's supposed satire is constantly undercut by its rigid obedience to its own formula. Since we can already guess, roughly, how everything will play out, I don't know why ""Kick-Ass"" spends so much time explaining itself.<br/><br/>When you hear the premise - real people trying to be superheroes - it sounds good, but watching this movie makes you think there are really only a few ways to handle it. There's ""The Dark Knight"" or ""Iron Man"" way, which is, more or less, taking it seriously. Or you could go for a satirical/darkly comic tone, which this movie tries for. If you were to do that, the best way to handle the violence would be to make it convincing, wouldn't it? Since, as the movie opens, it seems to make itself very clear that it doesn't take place in some phony superhero world? Instead, people get shot, they fall dead and CGI blood squirts out. You've seen one guy squirt CGI blood, you've seen 'em all - and it happens over and over again. The violence in this movie packs no punch, it's thoughtless and, supposedly, fun!, which makes it all the more disheartening when it's directed at the defenceless woman.<br/><br/>So it wasn't a very pleasant experience for me. Shift it an inch one way and you could've had a nice dark comedy (something by the Coens). An inch the other way you could've had a clever action movie (Crank & Crank 2). ""Kick-Ass"" is like a cautious kid, skirting the deep end without having the nerve to stick his toes in the water. It's not ballsy enough to take the father/daughter relationship to the logical, risky conclusion that it demands. It's not smart enough to question the motives of its boring protagonist - he's, basically, good (and he gets the girl). It's not original enough to offer us any ""evil"" that's not the cartoon kind we've already been tired of seeing in thousands of others movies. It's sense of humour is on the level of a disturbed child who likes to use swear words - which is one of its favourite jokes.<br/><br/>I said the movie's about real people trying to be superheroes. Not quite. It's about the ""real people"" you see in Hollywood movies, becoming superheroes. The ""real people"" played by Michael Cera or Shia LaBoef or Miley Cyrus. The ones who live in a glossy, safe world where they get what they want in the end. In this case, it's to have sex and kill a bunch of people. That could make for a great joke, except that, like those glossy Hollywood movies, it doesn't have the confidence to get you to actually think about it.<br/><br/>4/10 (Three points Nicolas Cage, one point Clark Duke. Otherwise, zilch.)"
"Dr_Sagan","Null","9","14","13 February 2016"," Quick review after seeing it back to back with the next one
","This an action comedy film addressed to younger audiences, heavy on gruesome violence and gleeful profanity.<br/><br/>Main star is 12 y.o.

Nicolas Cage plays her father and looks and acts ridiculous even in some really disturbing scenes.<br/><br/>This movie has a rather unique visual style. Unevenly Joyful to much the extremely bloody violence.

","Maybe people enjoy being fed something for their target demographic, but this is just building on the ""loner-loser"" hipster fetish that seems to be in every movie released. The main character is just a Michael Cera look-alike for Christ's sake, doesn't anybody get tired of this emasculated male crap? I'm not a fanboy nor do I know the source material, but it shouldn't be required. This just wasn't a good movie. It's another in a long line of teen-themed hipster genre movies that pretends it has a meaningful undercurrent but instead just falls flat.<br/><br/>It also hits on the same ""shocking"" notes as a lot of other films that look to be 'edgy' without putting in any effort for real social commentary. I've seen countless films in the last 3 or so years with casual cocaine use, children swearing/acting like adults, casual high school homosexuality, sudden knee-jerk violence, etc. It's not shocking, edgy, socially conscious or even fun any more. It's just tired and played out, unoriginal. Same old crap.<br/><br/>Besides its ""edginess"" there's just a very hallow, very tired superhero plot arc, complete with boring fanfare music and worn out origin stories. They throw in elements from classic teen movies that play out exactly as you would expect. The narrative, or what most folks would call the merit of the movie, plays like it came out of an instruction manual. There's no creativity here. <br/><br/>The violence isn't even as shocking or surprising as they pretend it is. I've seen cheap action movies from the 80s with more original graphic violence, not to say such a thing is high art or difficult to do. It's just silly and especially pointless in a self-aware movie like this one.<br/><br/>Keep shoveling on the crybaby teens mixed-genre movies so the box office is drained and Hollywood can move on.<br/><br/>Avoid. 2/10"
"Ctrl-Opt-Del","10","10","16","20 February 2012"," A truly unique movie
","Kick-Ass may not be the best superhero movie ever made, but it does have one quality that sets it apart from all others. There have been so very many superhero origin movies, but most are set in comic book universes where superheroism is already known, and so the emergent protagonists are treated as merely the new kid on the block. In Kick-Ass we get to see the actual emergence of the first ever superheros, and the inevitable surprised and - at first - incredulous attitude of both the general populace and the ""bad guys"".<br/><br/>This, for me, makes Kick-Ass probably the most original handing of superhero lore that has ever been presented."

","This film is really let down by it's DVD cover, the cover makes it look like a childish moronic superhero movie trying to be better than it actually is. However, don't take one look at the cover and turn away, this film is possibly my favourite film ever. This film combines gore, violence, comedy and sex. So, in actual fact, it's more adult than childish although I was only 13 when i first saw it and i thoroughly enjoyed it as did my 42 year-old dad who is very critical about most films so this really says something. As for the foul-mouthed 12-year old, do not be put off by this as this may not be entertaining but this makes the film what it is and you kind of just have to ignore the use of the C-word in one of the scenes. Even though this film is classed as comedy, it is very dark and even made me cry at one point. The intense blend of action with background music is amazing. This film has the coolest fight scenes i have EVER seen. Anyone in the right mind would want to see this, i recently got it on blu-ray and it astonished me how good the quality was so i definitely recommended it."
"Movie_Reviewer_from_LA","9","10","16","2 June 2011"," Kick-Ass Kicks Ass!
","Dave Linewski (Aaron Johnson) is your everyday average 17 year old nerd. Girls don't notice him, thugs steal his money, him and his friends sit out around at comic book shops reading comics and talking about girls and why people never become superheroes. After getting fed up with the crime in his city, though, Dave decides to take matters into his own hands and becomes his own masked hero: Kick-Ass, and becomes a local web and news sensation. Things aren't as easy as they seem for a juvenile crime fighter as he soon finds out, luckily he makes friends in the form of Big Daddy (Nicholas Cage), a Batman-like vigilante, and his 11- year-old sidekick Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz) who aren't adverse to the idea of literally taking out the scum of the earth. But when members of his crew start turning up dead, drug kingpin Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong) puts a price on Kick-Ass's head. <br/><br/>Mark Millar is an acclaimed comic writer best known for Wanted (which became the movie starring Angelina Jolie and James McAvoy) and his take on an alternate reality where Kal-El landed in the Soviet Union instead of America called Superman: Red Son. For Kick-Ass, Millar went back to conversations him and his brother had about becoming masked vigilantes, and took the conversation a step further and looked into what would actually happen if a teenager actually decided to take that step. As Millar got working on that comic, he also started working with Matthew Vaughn (director of Layer Cake, producer for Snatch and Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels) on some early ideas for Thor, but when Vaughn left Thor he started talking to Millar about his other comics. What started out as a plan to adapt American Jesus (Millar's sequel to the Bible) soon turned to conversations about Millar's still in the planning stage Kick-Ass. <br/><br/>Kick-Ass is the anti-comic book comic book movie. It skewers the genre while also paying loving homage to them. It would be all to easy to say it's a spoof of the genre, because while at times it may poke fun at the genre (remember that scene in Spider-Man where Peter Parker runs across a rooftop and jumps to the next roof, there's a spoof of that) it still also takes it's place amongst it's comic book peers with all seriousness. Kick-Ass is a very dark movie, not afraid of withholding the violence that a choice of vigilante crime fighting will lead to, even if that means beating an 11-year-old girl. This is graciously offset by a lot of comedy, chances are if you're not cringing from people's limbs getting hacked off or their heads exploding (yes there is one scene where that actually does happen) you'll be laughing hysterically. Not to mention pointing out to yourself homages to other comic book iterations (the aforementioned rooftop run, Big Daddy's Adam West like cadence when talking in the suit, Kick-Ass in an alley staring up at a wall as if about to scale it like Peter Parker, etc.) <br/><br/>The acting in the movie is phenomenal. Nicholas Cage hasn't been this good in years, and I was personally surprised to find out Aaron Johnson, who plays the title character, is actually a Brit. Christopher Mintz-Plasse (Superbad, Role Models) continues to surprise, considering most actors his age would have been typecast by a role like McLovin, and his arc actually did surprise having seen all of the trailers and promotional material for the movie prior to seeing the movie. The movie, though, is completely stolen by Chloe Moretz ((500) Days of Summer) as the foul mouthed, butt kicking 11-year-old Hit Girl. She plays the role with such force that you genuinely believe that full grown men, mafiosos, would be afraid of this 11-year-old girl. <br/><br/>Naturally, this movie isn't for everyone, as we've seen from the brouhaha that's erupted for a little girl uttering the ""C-word"", but this is one movie I think it's rewarding to see below the surface. There's a certain hint of satire in it's brutality meeted out by a child, and a certain tone in the movie that chastises us for not being more involved in helping those around us, while also showing it's understanding of why we sometimes choose not to. I honestly can say that I can find nothing wrong with this movie, and I'm currently considering adding it to my top 10 all-time favorites list. I highly recommend that you give it a try!"

"jcbutthead86","10","11","18","8 August 2013"," An Excellent,Action-Packed,Hilarious,Over The Top Superhero Action-Comedy And One Of The Best Superhero Films Ever Made.
","Kick-Ass is an excellent,entertaining and hilarious Superhero/Comic Book film that's filled with great direction,a wonderful cast,amazing Action,laugh out loud Comedy and a great score and soundtrack makes Kick-Ass one of the best Superhero films ever made and a Cult Classic.<br/><br/>Based on the Comic Book by Mark Miller and John Romita Jr. and Set in New York City,Kick-Ass tells the story of teenager Dave Lizewski,an outcast who has nothing in his life going for except for his love for Comic Books and Superheros. Dave's love for Comic Books and Superheros inspire Dave to become a crime fighter and calling himself Kick-Ass and becomes a sensation. However,when Kick-Ass angers local crime boss Frank D'Amico(Mark Strong),D'Amico wants Kick-Ass dead. Now,with the help of other crime fighters Hit-Girl(Chloe Grace Moretz)and her Father Big Daddy(Nicolas Cage),Kick-Ass has to stop D'Amico and end come out on top.<br/><br/>Kick-Ass is a brilliant,Action-packed and funny superhero film that wears it's over the top spirit on it's sleeve and gives viewers a film that mocks and reconstructs the Superhero genre and a movie that is violent,hilarious and offbeat and a true Cult Classic. One of the main reasons Kick-Ass is a great movie is that it takes the Superhero Comic Book genre and turns it on it's head taking aim at classic and iconic Superheros such as Batman,Superman and Spider-Man and the film's that associated with them taking all of the trademarks and familiar things and giving them a demented twist that is funny and stylish. Imagine the movie Watchmen if it was a Black Comedy. The Comedy and Humor is truly hilarious and done with a dark satirical glee that goes so over the top that you never know what's going to happen next whether it's with the film's characters or the violence and you as the viewer are pulled into a bizarre world where anything can and will happen. The Action and fight scenes in the film are fantastic and flawlessly executed with great skill and detail and fits in with the film's wild Comic Book energy. The violence is bloody and brutal but done in a funny way. While Kick-Ass takes place in a realistic setting the look of the film has a Surrealistic Comic Book style and look throughout the film with bright colors such as red,green and blue almost a Comic Book coming to life on the screen and it's just beautiful and visually stunning to look at. The screenplay by director Matthew Vaughn and Jane Goldman is just amazing and fresh with great dialog that is truly memorable and stylish and at the same time funny and quotable with very interesting characters that will stay in your mind after you have watched it. The film's main characters Kick-Ass and Hit-Girl are amazing,memorable characters that are fascinating to watch because of who they are and how different the two are from each other. Kick-Ass is a remarkable character because he is not like other Comic Book crime fighters or Superheros because Dave Lizweski(Kick-Ass' alter ego)does not become the hero Kick-Ass for the sake of revenge or because of something awful happening to his parents,Dave is just and awkward teenage kid who just wanted to be Kick-Ass because he wanted to know what it is like to be a Superhero and fight crime. And while Kick-Ass does not always succeed in kicking ass like much better and superior Superheros, Kick-Ass believes in what he's doing and you applaud him for what he tries to do even if he fails more than he succeeds. While the character Kick-Ass called himself Kick-Ass but in my opinion the real Kick-Ass was Hit-Girl. Hit-Girl is such an amazing character because despite Hit-Girl being 11 years old and a little bit small she can fight with anybody anytime and can handle herself without hesitation or doubt,using either guns,knives or her own fists. Where as Kick-Ass just became a crime fighter with no fighting skills,Hit-Girl was taught to fight criminals by her crime fighter Father Big Daddy so Hit-Girl can learn how to handle herself when she's all alone with the criminals. Hit-Girl is a character you will remember after watching the film. The most talked about and controversial thing about Kick-Ass is Hit-girl's use of harsh language and violence that she does in the film which will offend most viewers. And while I admit the cursing from Hit-Girl is shocking at times it does not offend me and I find Hit-Girl cursing funny because it's in the context of Comedy and the surreal Comic Book universe. The ending of Kick-Ass is amazing and Action-packed and will leave viewers with a smile. A great ending.<br/><br/>The whole cast is amazing. Aaron Johnson is excellent as Kick-Ass/Dave Lizewski,with Johnson bringing humor and likability to the role. Chloe Grace Mortez is brilliant as Hit-Girl/Mindy Macready,with Mortez bringing toughness,laughs and depth to the role. Christopher Mintz-Plasse is fantastic and funny as Chris D'Amico/Red Mist,Frank D'Amico's son. Nicholas Cage is great and over the top as Big Daddy/Damon Macready,Hit-Girl/Mindy's Father. Mark Strong is amazing and hilarious as Frank D'Amico,a local crime boss. Lindsay Fonseca is wonderful and sexy as Katie,Dave's crush. Clarke Duke(Marty),Evan Peters(Todd),Omari Hardwick(Sergant Marcus Williams),Michael Rispoli(Big Joe),Stu Riley(Big Goon)and Yancy Butler(Angie D'Amico)give good performances as well.<br/><br/>The direction by Matthew Vaughn is excellent and stylish,with Vaughn always moving the camera and giving the film a great pace,wonderful energy and visual style and also does a fantastic job with the Action scenes. Great direction,Vaughn.<br/><br/>The score by Marius De Vries,IIan Eshken,Henry Jackman and John Murphy is fantastic,epic and big and matches the tone of the film. A great score. There is also amazing songs on the soundtrack from Elvis Presley(Battle Hymm Of The Republic)The Dickies(Banana Splits),Joan Jett(Bad Reputation)and Ennio Morricone(For A Few Dollar More Theme).<br/><br/>In final word,if you love Superhero Films,Comic Book films,Action films or Comedies,I highly suggest you see Kick-Ass,an Action-packed and hilarious Superhero film and Cult Classic that you will never forget. Highly Recommended. 10/10."

","I have spent my entire life (I am 73 years old) avoiding any film with the word ""ass"" in it. My father was a gang member in Chicago in the 30's and 40's. I found this film by watching Anna Karenina and being gobsmacked by Aaron Johnson as Count Vronsky and then following the actor's career. I would never have seen it, based only upon it's title. But now, after laughing and smiling for the last two hours, I can say I highly recommend it. True, there is a lot of violence, but only the best kind. The good guys remain good and there's girl power at its finest. <br/><br/>No one will be inspired to destroy another human being by watching this film. I even venture to say that anyone who thinks this film harmful may be lacking in a fully developed sense of humor. Now, if you will excuse me, I am going to rent Kick-Ass 2."
"Olivia23","9","42","86","14 May 2010"," Kick-Ass is the best superhero movie out there!
","I have seen my share of superhero movies, and while most are pretty good, they all follow the same storyline. You know, the one where something happens to them physically/mentally to make them the way they are, but with Kick-Ass, it does not follow the normal superhero rules.<br/><br/>First of all the main character who is Kick-Ass is a geek. He is a nobody in school and has a group of geeky friends. He lives alone with his dad and even though he lives a pretty ordinary life, he is tired of being bullied by street thugs and he is also tired of the people who just watch and do nothing, so he decides to become Kick-Ass! Kick-Ass is an awesome character. He has no special skills and a terrible outfit to match. He tries to fight the thugs but is pretty much too much of a weakling to really fight back, but he has heart and he does not give up. In one of the fight scenes he meets Hit-Girl. She is the 11 year old everyone is talking about and she is the one who steals the show! She has amazing moves and is tougher than the Kick-Ass character.<br/><br/>Don't be fooled by the fact that this is a comedy, even though there are some funny scenes, it is not one of those goofy comedies where you laugh through the whole movie. There is quite a few bloody/gore/violent scenes that I did not expect and the young girl in the movie curses often. Another thing I did not expect is a scene that is quite sad near the end. I don't want to give away anything so you will have to watch it and see.<br/><br/>I am hoping there will be a sequel to this one that can live up to the first because it is such a good movie and with the way it ended, there could be a sequel. I'm hoping!"
"nightwriters","2","51","107","2 April 2010"," I must have seen a different movie than everyone else here ...
","Not having read the graphic novel upon which it's based, I had no expectations waking into Kick-Ass. The basic concept of a young man dressing up to act like a superhero wasn't that far out there, but outside of ""it would be so super cool if"" there was nothing in the film that spoke to why this kid wanted was willing to get himself killed in a stupid outfit. I love super hero movies (the Dark Knight being my favorite movie in years) and yet I don't know how many I found myself saying ""this is too stupid to believe"" throughout the film. In other words, the writing was weak, at times so weak that I found myself cringing at the hackneyed, shallow and two dimensional dialogue, and mystified by the inconsistent behavior of the characters (eg. Red Mist cold bloodedly kills Hit Girl, and then is sooooo upset that Kick-Ass is being abused ... just plain stupid). While the actions sequences were well choreographed and the acting of Nick Cage and Chloe Moretz kept it interesting, the mind numbing predictability of the story telling was simply fatal. If you're 12, love comics and have no need for a compelling coherent story in your films, by all means see Kick-Ass. In not, stay away."

Its doesn't make you think.<br/><br/>Once you've heard f''k over and over and over and over again, you've seen the blood from xth baddie shoot out the back of his head, you've tried to square the jarring contradictions, you realise that your just not a liberal, balanced, intelligent person and your not able to appreciate good knife edge work.

I think there is no problem with this film, I mean do people remember ""The Exorcist"" where you see a girl masturbating with a crucifix and people said it was an amazing movie, or ""The Professional"" where you see a girl join with an assassin that blows people's brains. People who think so negatively about this film, are super narrow minded idiots with no sense of humor. If you like martial arts, gunfire, superheroes, dark humor and stylized action, this is the movie for you, but if you only watch movies for character development, tone, art direction, script or other poetically beautiful crap like that and also if you are easily offended by almost anything, this movie is just not for you. I personally give it a 10/10.This movie is original, random, different and in the end, it has heart.

","""Original"" and ""Unconventional"" seem to be the common words used to describe ""Kick-Ass"". The movie climbed to the number one spot in the box office opening weekend, climbed up the prestigious IMDb Top 250 Movies of All Time, and has climbed into the hearts of moviegoers across the country. Unfortunately, all of this, especially the premise of the movie itself, is completely misleading.<br/><br/>A painfully mediocre high school student wants to make a difference in his own dull life and in the violence-ridden streets of his own city. Our antihero wants to become a superhero. The story starts off on the right note, getting us engaged and bringing on some good laughs in the process. He has no revenge story, no Martial Arts training, no money to get a hold on any cool gadgets. However, what begins as an ""unconventional"" and ""original"" superhero story, takes a turn and becomes the same typical, cliché, and generic superhero story it intends and claims to drift away from.<br/><br/>By some freak accident, he acquires a damaged nerve system that significantly decreases the sensation of pain, and even gets some cool metal plates integrated into his skeleton. Cool! Like accidentally getting bitten by a radioactive spider.<br/><br/>Then he meets Bid Daddy and Hit Girl. People love Hit Girl, and what's not to love? She's an 11-year old kid who can say bad words, dodge bullets, and kill a dozen bad guys at once. People say this movie has no gimmicks. An 11-year-old kid who can say bad words, dodge bullets, and kill a dozen bad guys at once is a total gimmick. Big Daddy is a supercop with a vendetta and Hit Girl is his daughter who has learned everything a supercop knows. They have a revenge story, and even have a ton of money which allows them to buy a bunch of fancy new weapons. Cool! Just like Batman.<br/><br/>Sure there may be some entertainment value in it for you, (if you're into a couple masturbation scenes and an 11-year old girl getting shot at) and the acting is convincing enough, given the ridiculousness of the story. The movie only falls short in being something other than what it claims to be. ""Kick-Ass"" is not ""original"" (see Blankman) and is not ""unconventional"" (see Spider-Man and Batman).<br/><br/>The last I checked, at the bottom of the Top 250 List was ""Toy Story 2,"" which is more than a hundred spots short of the place ""Kick-Ass"" landed so quickly. If you want to see a movie that's a hundred times more original and unconventional than ""Kick-Ass"", see the movie that's at the bottom of the list."

","It was really only a matter of time. The culmination of decades of brainwashing, dumbing down and awful, awful artistry have resulted in ""Kick Ass."" Yes, it was also only a matter of time until someone produced a movie with that title. Now that another cultural barrier has crashed, look forward to movies with cherished words like ""Retard"" and ""Balls"" in their titles. Use your imagination- it's easy to envision really profound titles by sprinkling in all those formerly forbidden words.<br/><br/>As for the movie itself, Hollywood takes its most prevalent theme- that of females beating up males- and speeds it up to a wharp factor. First, the female doing all that ass kicking is 11. ELEVEN. And she isn't content to knock them out with one punch from her dainty fists. No, she gruesomely kills them. While enjoying it immensely. She also enjoys mutilating them in the process. <br/><br/>The fact that any audience, anywhere, finds this graphic filth- which should by all rights be considered child pornography- entertaining at all is yet another sad indication that our civilization is beyond all hope. The violence in this film is so gratuitous, so disturbing, especially because it involved such a young girl, that it really wouldn't be any more offensive if the preteen actress was wandering around naked and having sex with adults, instead of gleefully murdering them.<br/><br/>If there is any justice in this world, ""Kick Ass"" will continue to under perform at the box office. The less money it makes, the better."
"davideo-2","4","41","85","26 April 2010"," No fun, even if you don't take it seriously
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>Tired of being a nerd who gets pushed around all the time, Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) takes his love of comic books to new lengths by donning a lame suit and calling himself Kick Ass. Despite proving woefully incompetent when facing real, tough bad guys, he just about manages to maintain a steely resolve- but after a while the assistance of 11 year old superhero prodigy Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz) starts to come quite in handy. But Hit Girl's father and superhero father Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) has vengeful issues of his own to deal with and they've all managed to rub the city's top crime boss Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong) up the wrong way, as things draw to a brutal, action packed conclusion.<br/><br/>In a world of genuine artistic vision, where a lot of directors see their work as a labour of love with which they are genuinely trying to convey something deep and meaningful to the audience, it's great and refreshing to see films that just were not meant to be taken seriously at all. Kick Ass falls slam bang into that category, but somehow still manages to miss it's target by about a mile.<br/><br/>It's most notable for being from the scribe of Johnathan Ross's missus Jane Goldman (he couldn't give a fair review!) as well as being co written and directed by Matthew Vaughn, who strangely managed a more fun and easy flowing tone with the darker and more serious Layer Cake. Performances wise, Johnson is adequately geeky and self depreciating as the weedy man turned hero and has sassy support from Moretz in the most controversial role in the film as the foul mouthed, multiple killing child. And in the most surprising role of the film, comic book enthusiast Cage lets his zany persona run wild (as he always does!) but still hasn't notched up a decent film. Strong is a good choice as the lead villain, but he'd have pulled it off better being given darker material than the flimsier stuff he has here. The film pays subtle homage to the likes of True Lies and even has a subtle commentary in a scene towards the end on the modern phenomenon of internet torture and executions.<br/><br/>Designed with the sole intention of being disposable fun and p!ssing Middle England off, Kick Ass is wild, self referring and fairly slick...it just isn't much fun. The similarly titled Shoot 'Em Up springs to mind for something more worthy. **"

","Dave Levinsky is one of those lame teenagers who spend 99% of their times jerking off, and the rest of time reading comic books. He soon starts fantasizing about becoming a superhero vigilante under the pseudonym ""Kick Ass"". Unfortunately his high expectations are not supported by superpowers or extraordinary capabilities.<br/><br/>After an appearance on TV, David ""Kick Ass"" is contacted by 2 hyper-violent vigilantes, which are of much higher level, and are doing real harm to the local drug mafia. Indeed, those 2 characters do not hesitate to use the most deadly weapons, or to even sell drugs, to fight the crime their own way...<br/><br/>This movie is very disappointing. It is marketed as a teenage movie, with a blend of American Pie, Superbad and Spiderman. Sadly, ""Kick-Ass"" ends up being not so funny, and becomes a tribute to heavy gun violence and self-justice and broken ethics. For example, the 2 superheros resell drugs to fund their armory, which is not what you would expect from ""good"" guys. Did I mention, those 2 superheroes are father and daughter, the later (11-year old girl) skipping school to practice guns and kung-fu?<br/><br/>The film production is also deeply disappointing, the screenplay is minimal, the special effects being very visible and exaggerated. The acting is very poor, you can hear laughs in the auditory when Nicolas Cage is narrating the death of his beloved pregnant wife. The ""bad"" guys have absolutely no presence.<br/><br/>Finally like many recent blockbuster movies, the director makes sure to keep one the bad guy alive, in order to leave the door opened for a very profitable sequel (Kick-Ass 2 is already scheduled for 2012).<br/><br/>To be avoided. 3/10"

However, my sheer enjoyment of the movie probably shows I should change newspaper!<br/><br/>The Film is quite simply fantastic, entertaining and thoroughly enjoyable. Yes it may not show the 'perfect' role models for teenagers around the world, but it is a lot more moral than it is made out to be. Look at it from the outside: The police are unable to stop petty crime, so a teenager, Dave Lizewski (Aaron Taylor-Johnston) decides to make a stand against it, dressing himself in a wet suit he bought online and chasing criminals. Although his methods may not have been perfect at the beginning, and he is seen as a total vigilante, ultimately he did what was right for his neighborhood. <br/><br/>But Dave didn't have the only lead role - along came 'Hit-girl', the 'real' superhero in Dave's eyes.

"kylehaines96","10","4","5","8 January 2013"," The Anti Superhero Film(**** Out Of ****)
","Kick-Ass is a unique film. It is a film that definitely falls under the ""Take-No-Prisoners"" category. The film is brutal and vulgar and it is deliciously demented. Kick-Ass is a brilliant comic book written by Mark Millar, and yes, there are differences between the comic book and film, but I don't go into a movie adapted from source material and nitpick if one character didn't do something he did in the book. However I do pay attention to see if it lives up to the book. Films like ""Percy Jackson And The Olympians The Lightning Thief"" and ""Alex Rider: Operation Stormbreaker"" are terrible adaptations of the original source material. Kick-Ass is one of the films that follows the book but makes changes, for a reason. If everything in the novel was in the film, than it would have been rated NC-17, which is the stamp of death for movies.<br/><br/>The films follows Dave Lizewski played by Aaron Johnson is pondering the age-old question: How come nobody wants to be a Superhero? After the crime rate has gone up in his city he decides he wants to dress up like a superhero and take down some thugs. However, his first encounter does not go so well as he is stabbed and hit by a car. Miraculously, he survives and decides to have another go at it. He launches into worldwide fame after a video is posted online of him beating up 3 thugs, goes viral. He goes to do another job but the plan goes awry when the gang member gets the upper hand. He is then helped by Hit-Girl played by Chloe Grace Mortez and her father Big Daddy played by Nicholas Cage. The films villain Frank D'amico played by Mark Strong and his son Chris played by Christopher Mintz-Plasse devise a plan to kidnapped Kick-Ass by having Chris be a new Superhero named Red-Mist. The rest is for you to watch the film and find out for yourself.<br/><br/>The films acting is very strong. Aaron Jonson is very good in his film debut as the title character. Chloe Grace Mortez is very good and vulgar in her debut as well. Christopher Mintz-Plasse is of course good as the sort of awkward kid who wants to make it big. Nicholas Cage is always great and fun to watch. He is especially hilarious as the gun toting nut Big Daddy.<br/><br/>The story is different yet original. This is sort of the Anti Superhero movie. This film brings to light that Superheroes don't always win. I love it. It's a bold approach and it is different to see superheroes placed in more danger than the PG-13 cookie cutter comic book movies. I have nothing wrong with those movies but I would love to see something different.<br/><br/>This film has two types of humor. The genuinely funny humor that happens from dialouge exchanges from characters, and the shocking humor. A perfect example is when Chloe Grace Mortez, who was 11 years old when filming is swearing all over the place with her saying lines like, ""Okay you C***s, lets see what you can do."" The character development is great and the characters of Big Daddy and Hit Girl have amazing back-stories. Hit Girl's mom died of a prescription drug overdose while her father was in prison. Big Daddy's motivation for going after Frank is that Frank put him in prison and left Hit Girl without a father for a few years. These characters have a motivation for getting their revenge.<br/><br/>Laslty I want to advise a warning. This film is extremely brutal, vulgar and violent. The torture scene in the film is very brutal and hard to watch. I know this sounds crazy but the torture scene in the book is more brutal than the film. Also there is blood galore in this film but has the same amount or less amount of blood than in the book. They wanted to make this movie PG-13 but, honestly, it would not have worked. Also 80% of the violence is enacted by a child who is Chloe Grace Mortez. This may be hard to watch and that is understandable. Lastly there is a brief but painful scene where Hit Girl is getting strangled by Frank. By me awarding this film 4 stars, I am not promoting child violence or violence against children, as a matter of fact it sickens me, But this is a movie based off of a comic book. It is not realistic and It is heavily stylized. I understand if you find this material hard to watch, but lets be honest an 11 year old girl is not going to go on a murderous rampage. Roger Ebert famously gave the film 1 star out of 4 saying ""Should I be cool, or have a Heart?"" I am not cool by rating the film 4 stars but I am being honest. So was Roger Ebert and I respect him for it.<br/><br/>This film earns my 4 star rating. The acting is strong, the story is brilliant and the film is brutally fun and shockingly funny. Kick-Ass is a movie with brutality but heart. This is a comic book film not to be missed.<br/><br/>Rated R For Strong Brutal Violence Throughout, Pervasive Language, Sexual Content, Nudity And Some Drug Use- Some Involving Children.<br/><br/>1hr 57min/117min.<br/><br/>112 uses of the F-word.<br/><br/>****/****"
"cat_ranchero","9","4","5","22 November 2012"," Still excellent on my third viewing!...
","I must first say that it is a really well made film with some excellent stunt work. I thought the music chosen for the score was really great as well. Excellent performances from all of the leading cast, Aaron Johnson as Dave Lizewski/Kick-Ass, Nicolas Cage as Damon Macready/Big Daddy is excellent, Chloe Moretz as Mindy Macready/Hit-Girl (also superb), Mark Strong as Frank D'Amico, Christopher Mintz-Plasse as Chris D'Amico/Red Mist and Lyndsy Fonseca as Katie Deauxma.<br/><br/>There is a lot of humour in this film, both spoken and visual. It's also very very violent, so I wouldn't recommend it to those of a nervous disposition. I don't usually enjoy teen comedies, but this is very original, very different and it's very refreshing to see a film that pushes the boundaries somewhat. It's a film that any superhero film fan should try to watch at least once a year, just to see how it should be done!<br/><br/>SteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED<br/><br/>My score: 9.3/10<br/><br/>You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster."
"Snowgoat","4","41","86","8 April 2010"," Don't believe the hype.
","Don't believe the hype. The only things you haven't seen here before are a pretty funny Adam West impression from Cage, and the sight of an eleven year old girl killing henchmen (if that does it for you). The first hour is some pretty lame high-school American-Pie/Superbad-ish comedy that segues into some pretty ill-natured and nasty-edged violence (that is rarely justified). The film never really has the satirical bite it promises and it ends up becoming a pretty standard action movie heavily reliant on guns (I thought this was supposed to be a super-hero movie?!). It also quickly rejects its ""real world – real physics"" premise pretty quickly, which blunts the entire point of the film. <br/><br/>By far the best thing about the film is the action scenes - which are pretty well made and fairly originally shot - though they tend to leave a bit of a bad taste in the mouth, owing to the fact there aren't any really likable characters in the film and the whole plot is pretty morally bankrupt. There is also a hugely uncomfortable scene with Hit- Girl in a school uniform which makes you feel like you've stumbled across an illegal website. <br/><br/>In the end the film feels far too much like a too many other movies (though obviously genre references are essential) to have much of it's own identity (Watchmen, Spiderman, Superbad, Kill Bill, etc.) It's also not nearly funny enough to be a comedy - shoot me down but I honestly found the underrated Mystery Men funnier, and that was over ten years ago!<br/><br/>I wasn't excited about this film until seeing the reviews, and having seen it, I'm now pretty confident that the fawning reviews of the UK media (it came out here a few weeks before US) have been heavily influenced by editors insistent on giving a film with so much UK talent (star, director, writer etc) good reviews. It all smacks of back- scratching/palm greasing. This is nowhere near a five star film, and I'm keeping my hopes up that the upcoming ""Defendor"" better delivers on the promise of a similar premise."
"revival05","4","38","79","9 April 2010"," Old hero in a new costume
","The mood was elevated in the cinema house when I saw a pre-release of this movie the other night. People were at several times applauding the screen. I'm not sure, because I was heading out for the restrooms, but people might have been doing a standing ovation during the credits.<br/><br/>So what do I know, right? I got a similar reaction to District 9 which was a movie that people were overwhelmed with, despite the fact that it really had not one single new concept and no real impressive sign of originality to match what people had been saying. District 9 did for the sci-fi genre kind of what this movie, Kick-Ass, is trying to do with the superhero movie I think. District 9 was still a good film though. I don't think Kick-Ass is a particularly good film. And I doubt people will hail it as a masterwork of originality.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie: Nerdy high school guy becomes famous superhero, fights street thugs, teams up with high tech gadget doctor (sic), takes on an evil empire, in this case a drug lord, they fight, get caught, fight, get caught. Big booms. Oh, and yeah he gets a girlfriend and all of that too. The movie is stylish and flashy and consistently self- apologetic, the beginning of the movie starts out with such a distance to the superhero genre that you almost believe you are watching a spoof. A kid wants to become a superhero, calls himself Kick-Ass and gets dressed up and starts walking the streets. As it is said in the movie, he should change his name to ""ass-kick"" because that's all he gets. Thus he joins the likes of Blankman and the Mystery Men. Kick-Ass, though, is the first superhero pastische that people seem to like. <br/><br/>Or so I thought halfway into the movie, before the forty minute mark or so when it gets all carried away in itself, leaves spoof land and invisibly attempts to raise it's own stakes. Suddenly you are expected to care for these characters that have been presented as stereotypes. I mean, take it somewhat seriously. This is in particular strange; Nicholas Cage is being hysterically good as a daddy training him and his ten year old girl to become superheroes. Are they any good? Uh-huh. The kid is the movie's real showstopper. This is the first ten year old you've seen that can cut a head open whilst emptying up humanity's worst vocabulary along with the ammo of her automatic weapon. Cage is also all dressed up with. An. Adam West. Imp. Ression. That is. Quite amusing. In... Deed?<br/><br/>But there comes a time when the movie wants me to simply buy these characters emotionally and somewhat realistically. I buy them as jokes, as parodies, as an outrageous bloody comedy. But do I have to consider that this would be an actual kid and that this would be her actual dad? Am I suppose to believe this fairly far-fetched idea of a local superhero getting famous over the Internet? And why should I care? And if this plot is worth actually devoting your serious interest in, why does it start off like some kind of realistically laid out spoof? Kick- Ass begins with a world that makes a deal of how real it is, life's dull and normal circumstances and how a self-made superhero gets stabbed in the guts. But it all ends up with dodging bullets and flying in jet-packs anyway. I did enjoy the first part of the movie, it was basically a very amusing take on the superhero genre which is getting pretty tiring by now anyhow. But the most ironic thing about Kick-Ass is that despite the visual costume, it turns out it really is just another superhero movie. It really offers zip to the genre. It wants more than anything else to be what it is making fun of. The plot is intended to be taken seriously, until it stops and makes fun of itself, then continues, then stops for a joke. It really does resemble a little kid dressed as a superhero, making the story up as he goes along.<br/><br/>Now I know what you are saying, isn't this just simply a lot of fun? Oh, I'm using my brain again? This isn't a thinking man's superhero movie? I should just shut up and enjoy the violence? Well, I don't know, that is something I cannot do. It's been a long time since I was impressed solely by bright flashy things and a lot of blood and guts. I might be getting too old for this bleep."

I guess one area they did excel was insulting the female audience and making some of us ladies squirm at the awkward unnecessary scenes. I think that idiot Eli roth and the national lampoons directors got together and conjured up something like this ""ok guys, what can we think of that is degrading, sexist, gross, and will show the biggest lack of class? hmmmmm"" then they came up with this stupid movie. If you are a big moron, like movies with no substance, many sexist and degrading moments in regards to women, enjoy tit and nipple talk, are a horny pubescent teen who cant get laid other than rubbing your genitals between a playboy magazine and like watching guys jerking the turkey, then this is a must see.

None of these worked.<br/><br/>I thought all the characters did their stuff well: Nicolas Cage and, of course, Chloe Moretz were fun to watch but the in the end, the overall package was well short of satisfactory.<br/><br/>Others might disagree but I felt very uncomfortable watching a 10 year old girl being beaten up (quite realistically) on screen.

I never thought a movie could be so beyond the grasp of artistic and theatrical reality. Well I was proved wrong tonight. So far fetched, even for such a genre. Don't get me wrong....there were some funny scenes and exciting action sequences, but that is all forgotten by the end. I could of understood the addition of the character Nicolas Cage plays, having lost his wife seeks bitter retribution. But the daughter, I don't know who the hell this little child is but she couldn't act if her life depended on it. No need for her character at all. The character just plane doesn't work.<br/><br/>Almost the entire audience felt disdain during her characters scenes. The plot had great potential. They could of produced a decent movie... The geek who has no super powers becomes a super hero only to fail and here comes Nicolas cage's character to the rescue..only to die just having attained revenge.. and that would of been a better film...well something like that anyway. Toward the end, I was only hoping the child gets a bullet to the head, just in time to see the credits start rolling. Now that would of saved this movie.

","I cannot begin to convey the depth of chagrin one feels when reading the reviews about this movie. The film is being hailed as a masterpiece and the next great painting that hangs in The Louvre. America is a sick nation. Mentally. Spiritually. Culturally. And it's getting more ill as time goes by. The deterioration has been rapid. Due to the now rapid dissemination of information, the problem is that the rest of the world will follow.<br/><br/>I exhort, nay, I beseech all normal people and especially parents around the world to resist this malady that is seemingly omnipotent and omnipresent. I make this plea to you because the internet now allows export of this malady to all corners of the globe effortlessly. The malady is in the form of acculturation to deaden our senses to violence, feminism, devaluation of parents and debauchery, and this malady is what currently governs American thinking.<br/><br/>Resist in your minds the temptation to be overwhelmed by sheer numbers. Resist in your hearts the impulse of accepting these deleterious, inane movies, as real films, simply because they are being touted as being made by the United States.<br/><br/>This film is one thing only: Evil incarnate. I say it again, unequivocally and without hesitation. This movie is evil. And I urge all governments to ban it forthwith!

"if_time_Was_god","6","26","52","4 April 2010"," Disappointing
","At the start it looked as though Kick-Ass was going to be a funny and different film; it seemed like it would be a ""realistic"" superhero movie with an interesting plot. However, although the 'superhero' (Kick-Ass) remained as a normal (although with lots of crazy things happening to him) character living in New York, a lot of the other characters- namely the two actual super heroes he meets- completely change the film into an unrealistic, clichÃ©d American action film. <br/><br/>The thing I did like about this film however was that it wasn't afraid to be offensive. There was lots of violence, swearing and completely politically incorrect things that went on- which was all good! However, it was spoiled by a completely predictable plot and the fact that the director obviously didn't really know what kind of film he wanted it to be (realistic comedy or superhero movie). Also, the film at times seemed to be just an advert for Myspace and Apple as the product placement in it was just horrible! <br/><br/>Kick-Ass did have it's moments but it really didn't live up to it's hype for me- save your money for something else!"
"son_of_cheese_messiah","1","32","66","5 May 2010"," Death Wish 3 for the in-crowd
","This might be the post modern version of Death Wish 3! It even ends with an unconventional use of a missile launcher which may be a sly tribute to that unintentionally great film.<br/><br/>Kick Ass is far less entertaining however. Voice overs are seldom a good idea in movies, and here we have one of the most annoying, full of the endless pop culture references which have become the norm. Nicolas Cage does a funny impression of Adam West in costume but otherwise I don't see why this would be described as hilarious.<br/><br/>The violence is among the brutal I've ever seen and the heroes completely unsympathetic. These are actually not superheroes but masked vigilantes and, despite the usual 'ironic' defence, their bloody vengeance is seen as a good, or at least cool, thing. One scene in particular left me numb; this was not the notorious c-word outburst (actually one of the milder things in this film) but seeing a helpless man handcuffed in a car being intentionally crushed to death -by the superheroes! <br/><br/>With the sole exception of the pre-pubescent Hitgirl, all the other females in this film are mere sex objects for the gratification of the males. Interestingly, all mother figures are unceremoniously killed off-screen, their deaths being mentioned only in one line of dialogue. KickAss's mum died from cancer while Hitgirl's in childbirth. Neither is shown the slightest degree of sympathy.<br/><br/>This lack of empathy to women (or any one) and grotesque violence made me assume that the original author must had been an adolescent. On consulting wikipedia, to my surprise he was in his late thirties. No doubt this is a demonstration of how infantilised our culture has become."
"Crossfire3636","1","32","66","25 April 2010"," In MY humble opinion
","I was very skeptical about seeing this movie: it looked like another one of those stupid trying-to-be-funny kid romps. Then i saw that it was a controversial over the top violent action movie, so i said, hey, why not. I went to see it with a friend and we both had the same verdict. TWO THUMBS DOWN. I thought ONE line was funny, the rest was just what I thought it would be: teens and little kids TRYING to be funny. I also don't mind brutal action movies, but NOT starring little kids. I was honestly pleasantly surprised that Ebert gave this movie 1 and a half stars. The action scenes were great, but only if they had been done by grownup. If these kids were in an all out comedy, that would be different, but they weren't so...I am probably the only one who hated this movie, but that just my humble opinion."
"popitotoro","1","12","21","19 December 2010"," This is just not right at all...
","Kick Ass is a failure. As someone already stated on, the main issue is that it doesn't decide whether it should be a funny movie or an action/serious type movie. Actually the opening gives you a hint, like am I supposed to laugh at a guy committing suicide? I guess watchers are expected to, as the off-voice present it as funny. After that few minutes later you get a father shooting his 11 year old daughter in the chest so that she gets used to. Child soldier, another matter of big unleashed laughs it seems. Whatever.<br/><br/>And then, the point where I definitely stopped wondering myself whether this movie was supposed to have anything of ""real"" : the accident. The poor guy gets stabbed (here I was sure, it was serious, looked pretty bad), he gets involved in a car accidents and half of his body has to be fixed artificially. Needless to say we are still supposed to find it funny, and not wondering how his poor old man could pay for the hospital (I just watched Sicko... how different!)<br/><br/>And don't tell me it's not supposed to take place in America... Actually I wonder how such a movie can get such a high score? I mean, is there so many people with no brain?<br/><br/>If people however want to see what could have been done, I invite them to watch ""True Romance"", a movie in which a regular guy becomes a ""super hero"" and takes huge risks to help his lover. Now that is a good movie, with a real tribute to comic books."
"headly66","1","38","81","19 April 2010"," Disgusting
","This is one gross movie. What with the director ripping off most modern action and hero movies he has been able to mildly entertain and make you puke in one fell swoop. The sexual overtones about an 11 year old make me want to drag the director out back and show him what's funny about beating up children and dressing them in sexy outfits. This could have been an interesting spin on the anti-hero movie but the last half is so over the top and outrageous it is simply a failure. Everything that was entertaining about Kill Bill (which this garbage completely steals from) is not entertaining here. Too much death, blood and bullets leads to boredom. This is violence without remorse, feeling or purpose.<br/><br/>A huge BOMB.<br/><br/>NOTE- Video gamers and meat heads will love this because it hits on all their loser qualities. Something for nothing, fictitiously getting girls who are way out of their league and tough guy violence that in real life would make them pee their pants."

One of the most original and entertaining graphic novel conversions to the screen yet made. Recommended."
"arcticcarrot","2","32","67","22 April 2010"," Ways In Which ""Kick-Ass"" Sucks
","1. First of all, the guy wears glasses, but when he's dressed as Kick-Ass he takes them off. He does not put in contact lenses. And this is not Superman. He actually needs the glasses. So how is he able to see, for example, when he flies the jet pack and shoots at the bad guys through the windows near the end? <br/><br/>2. Does anyone believe for a second that the teenage girl works at a needle-exchange program? And even if she does volunteer there, it would be on a Saturday afternoon with a lot of adult supervision, and she'd be filing forms or something. There is no way she'd be there alone at night. No bloody way.<br/><br/>3. The tone of this film is all over the place. Is it a fun, silly comic book movie? Is it a teen comedy? Is it a mob movie? Is it a serious family drama? Is it an over-the-top action film? It seems like five different editors were given various sections to edit, and each of them was told the film was a different genre. Or maybe five different directors.<br/><br/>4. How did Nicholas Cage begin to pay for all of his weapons? Remember, he was in jail for five years, and before that he worked as a police officer. Sure, in the film, we see them steal money from drug dealers. But what about before that - how did he pay for his costume and everything to start with? But that also brings up another issue - those drug dealers looked like small-time lowlifes, but apparently they had millions of dollars in their apartment.<br/><br/>5. What's the deal with the teenage girl assuming that the boy is gay just because two thugs beat him up? Did that make sense to anyone? Does every gay person get attacked by thugs? Is that how you know someone is gay? I hate this movie.<br/><br/>6. So when did Nicholas Cage develop his skill as a comic book artist? While working on the police force? Or during his five years in prison? And when his old police partner shows up at his house and sees his work, it's in an actual comic book form, all professionally put together and everything. So did Nicholas Cage hire a company to actually produce his work? And wouldn't that perhaps give away his plan to kill all of those people, since that's what the comic book is about?<br/><br/>7. The writer had troubles with math. At the beginning we see Kick-Ass, and there is voice over that leads us to six months earlier, when it all started. But then in that voice-over which takes place six months earlier, he says, ""Over the next 18 months."" Okay, so that takes us a year beyond our point of entry. A year into the future. Dumb-ass writer.<br/><br/>8. The voice over at the beginning is from the guy and he says he's not a jock, he's not a nerd, he's not this, he's not that. Basically it's saying he has no identity. And then in the film he takes on the fake identity of a super hero. But the film never addresses that issue, of a teen finding and molding his own identity. If the film had decided to stick with its more serious tone, it could have explored this issue and it might have been an interesting film.<br/><br/>9. This movie has absolutely no idea what its target audience is. You would think it's aimed at 12 and 13 year old boys. But it's rated R. So those kids can't see it. So then you have to assume it's aimed at adults. But if it's aimed at adults, then why have all the stupid crap that the kids will identify with? <br/><br/>10. Has anyone ever been to a comic book store that also has a restaurant in it? Comic book store owners are seriously paranoid about the condition of the comics. There is no way they'd want food anywhere near the comics.<br/><br/>11. The CG flat-out sucks. How about that ridiculous shot of Nicholas Cage on fire? Did a child draw those flames in? I think so.<br/><br/>12. Sorry, but I don't want to see a mob boss punching an 11-year-old girl in the face. I just don't.<br/><br/>13. There is that stupid scene where one person (in this case a child) runs down a hall and manages to kill like a dozen or more professional killers without getting even a scratch (though they're all shooting at her).<br/><br/>14. How old is Hit Girl anyway? At some point in the movie someone says she looks like she's eleven. That seems about right. But at the end she's going to high school. So is she fourteen? She doesn't look it.<br/><br/>Okay, this is all just off the top of my head. There is a lot more wrong with this stupid film, but i need to get on with my day."

"jeffrey-utley","8","5","7","24 August 2013"," Very Good Mix of Comedy, Action, and Some Drama
","'Kick-Ass' brought an incredible hype with it when it came out in 2010. From that they were able to make the sequel, 'Kick-Ass 2'. So I went into 'Kick-Ass' with somewhat high expectations. It met if not exceeded my expectations.<br/><br/>How was the acting?<br/><br/>The acting in 'Kick-Ass' was very good. Aaron Taylor-Johnson did really well as Dave Lizewski and as Kick-Ass. He portrayed Dave Lizewski as a high school student and the character put on a different face for Kick-Ass. Aaron Taylor-Johnson was able to portray Kick-Ass differently, which is what the film was shooting for. Christopher Mintz-Plasse also did very well playing Chris D'Amico. I didn't see him as Fogell from Superbad. Chloe Grace Moretz did very well playing Mindy Macready and portrayed her well as an intimidating 11-year-old. Last of all, Nicholas Cage did extremely well playing Damon Macready. He probably did the best out of all of these actors and actresses. He was amazing in this film.<br/><br/>How was the writing?<br/><br/>The writing in 'Kick-Ass' seemed very realistic. There were many scenes with high school students, and the characters seemed like real high school students. They messed with each other, teased each other, and had comedic dialog throughout the film that was actually humorous. I liked many aspects of the film including the realistic tone of it. I liked how the protagonist, antagonist, and several of the main characters had at least more than one layer to them. I also enjoyed many of the plot events, especially near the end. In the end, there was also a fair amount of emotion in this mixed-genre film. For a usual mixed- genre film, it's just a movie that doesn't know what it wants to be. This film, though, separated the genre into different sections, which would seem lazy, but it actually made the film better. When it wasn't serious, it had comedic elements. When there were action sequences, it had moderately thrilling elements. In a few serious scenes, it had the right score in the background so that it's a drama.<br/><br/>Did it have an interesting premise?<br/><br/>In an action/comedy, one of the main flaws would be the premise. Luckily, this film had an alright premise. It wasn't necessarily good, but it definitely wasn't bad. I'll say it's above average, but somewhat good for what it was.<br/><br/>Was it entertaining or boring?<br/><br/>This film had slow parts near the beginning and middle, which sadly brought the rating down, but for the most part it was entertaining. I thought that they could have sped film up in those acts, but it tried to show too many characters. There were about four sets of characters, which made the film have to split camera time between them, making the scenes somewhat boring. It did pick up after a while, though.<br/><br/>What things in particular did I like (that I haven't already covered)?<br/><br/>'Kick-Ass' had very enjoyable and thrilling action sequences throughout the film. The layered characters were also aspects of the film that made the action sequences more thrilling. The ending of the film was also very satisfying to me. It mixed the right amount of drama and emotion to make the sequences great then.<br/><br/>What things in particular did I dislike (that I haven't already covered)?<br/><br/>The film was not as humorous as I thought it would be. It didn't have a big use of comedic elements, and the ones that were used stayed mostly the same, and got old by the third act of the film."
"mrrockey","8","5","7","11 August 2013"," Violent, Twisted, Foul... I Like It!
","Kick-Ass is one of the most refreshing superhero films I've seen in a long time. It's violent, twisted, foul, offensive, disgusting, and I love it! But how can you like a movie that encourages 11-year-olds to swear like AVGN, you ask. I'm gonna take a look into it and find out.<br/><br/>The first thing people need to understand about Kick-Ass is that this movie is pure escapist fantasy. Yes, the movie is about a guy who tries to become a superhero in the "" real world "" but let's face it, this movie isn't very realistic and it was never meant to be. It's just meant to be an escapist fantasy so the fact that it has so little morals in this movie actually isn't a problem. This isn't No Country for Old Men or The Godfather where you can discuss the morality behind the characters decisions and decide on your own who's right and who's wrong. This is closer to movies like The Warriors or the James Bond series where you know what you're watching isn't politically correct but you still enjoy it because of how much fun it is.<br/><br/>Kick-Ass is also really funny, clever, and unique. The comedy in this film is very foul and crude but to me, it's actually pretty funny! This movie kinda has its own hyper-reality where people cuss all day and crime is more prominent and people are a lot more raunchy. So not everybody will find this movie funny but I do and I think it's a great satire on modern superhero movies.<br/><br/>While this movie isn't terribly deep and complex, it does have one important theme it analyzes. What makes a hero a hero? Dave Lizewski is not the ideal hero. He isn't a strong, athletic guy who can kick the crap out of bad guys, he's just a guy who has a dream and goes for it. But ultimately, he becomes a hero because of his good heart and not because he can kick @ss. Same with Hit-Girl, who is just an 11-year-old girl but she becomes a hero at the end of the film when she takes down Frank D'amico's men nearly all by herself. While this movie is really foul and crude, it has a very optimistic message to it that everybody can be a hero.<br/><br/>So there is a little bit of character stuff in this movie but its main focus is just to entertain and I think the director, Matthew Vaughn did an amazing job with this film. He brought the world of Kick-Ass to life perfectly and I especially love his choice of music here. It sounds very Quentin Tarantino influenced, it's great!<br/><br/>The performances here are top notch. Aaron Johnson is really likable and funny here as Kick-Ass and he carries the film well. Mark Strong is a little over-the-top here but it's appropriate because Kick-Ass takes place in a hyper-reality. But the people who steal the show are Nicolas Cage and Chloe Moretz. They have a great father-daughter relationship going on but also as hero and sidekick.<br/><br/>Overall, Kick-Ass is a really funny, clever, unique, and refreshing superhero film so I'm gonna give it a 8/10."

","Well, i was expecting some kind of a comic hero parody like super hero movie, or along those lines. Which is decently good, but my god, i was totally wrong.<br/><br/>Kick ass is something totally unexpected, and its very hard to describe. Its a light comedy, yet it has a lot of insane violence, you see people getting shot in the head, members going off the body, knives going trough hands, insane amounts of gunshots. How that mix of genres worked out?. Apparently very easy. Being original.<br/><br/>The soundtrack will subtly drag you inside the movie, the plot its great, the cast couldn't be better, they are all very likable and convincing, specially Hit girl, i never saw something like that, the action secuences look like taken out from kill bill, blade, the dark knight and jackie chan movies.<br/><br/>I hope this give you a vague idea about the movie. But one thing is for sure, it will blow your mind."
"tommy-244","9","22","44","18 May 2010"," Very cool movie
","Usually I don't like comic book movies but this one is really cool and interesting. Even Nicolas Cage, who I normally have some big issues with, makes a pretty solid effort.<br/><br/>I must admit that without the character Hit Girl this movie would have scored less than now. But by no way could the movie be without Kick Ass, Red Mist or Big Daddy. In fact every character seems to be exactly what this movie needs and makes this something that you sooner or later need to watch.<br/><br/>But again, Hit Girl is the new definition of COOL. I do not know much about Chloe Moretz who plays her but this could be to her little like Leon was to Natalie Portman (there are more than one similarities between ""Mathilda"" and ""Hit Girl"").<br/><br/>This movie has many references to films like Kill Bill, Spiderman and many more. But strangely I think this movie somehow beats them all."

","Well where I can begin. I was invited to view the preview and write a short review over this movie KICKASS. I must say I entered the theatre with a very sceptical approach (i was assuming i would rate the movie 4/10), the tag line for the film did not appeal to me and I expected the aimed audience to be for teenagers.<br/><br/>I was shocked to see unique character chemistry between nick and his little one (you will find out when u watch it people). This film is very exciting and I ended up giving it a rating of 7/10 because I must say I have not seen a movie like this before. I actually enjoyed this movie very much....after half way. But none the less it was very well choreographed with the fight and action scenes with good but rare humour. Is this film violent......YES! Is the film straight to the point with the action....YES? Is this film worth watching.....YES! Was I impressed....YES I must say I proudly flaunted the idea to my friends that I had the opportunity to see it first.<br/><br/>But it took to long to start...""the film"" if you know what i mean<br/><br/>I'm not a film critic hehe although I was sitting next to one at the time and he mirrored my feelings towards the movie.... He said at the end ""Well!! Did u like it?"" I replied...""hmmm very different and I would watch it again although it was slow paced to begin with"" He replied...""yeh could do with a bit of snipping, and then it would be just fine!"" And we talked over and over the scenes we couldn't get enough of, which I think every person will feel is the same after watching this movie.. it is like a modern day 300 hehe<br/><br/>So don't expect me to be deep in detail because I am to busy saving the world right now.<br/><br/>rating 7/10 people get out there and watch it!!"
"commando117","3","30","63","9 April 2010"," Very disappointing
","I entered the cinema expecting to see one of those seemingly usual teen comedies but with a twist. What I actually ended up seeing was a movie I wouldn't watch again unless I were paid to.<br/><br/>I am not someone who watches a lot of comedies but I occasionally dabble in the genre watching the likes of The Hangover and Big Lebowski. Although these movies are completely unrelated and different from each other, they are an example of a good comedy. The viewer is left confused and searching for an answer to what the hell just happened on screen and the randomness that ensues, however in the end it all makes perfect sense. Kick ass on the other hand falls short in every aspect of a comedy movie. Yes, it does contain some funny moments, however I feel as though that director concentrated on making the actual violence funny but introducing a little 11 or so year old girl who loves killing and is good at it. However somehow I feel that making her arrogant just adds insult to injury.<br/><br/>There are those of you who will argue that the film is based on the comic books and thats the reason for the terrible plot line, however that does not mean the director has no room for creativity. On that topic it would have just been a good idea to not make a movie based on a comic book when the storyline is going to end up being so incredibly predictable. Its as if the director has tried to implement some twists in the movie by having the 'McLovin' character pretend to be a hero just so he can mislead the hero but in the end this all ends up being a COMPLETE waste of time.<br/><br/>The acting from the lead character was not great and at times some of the scenes were so predictable it was cringe worthy just watching them. This brings us back to the little girl who is one of the main links on the chain the humour in the movie, yet the way she has acted out her parts and generally the way she talks in the movie makes you wish she actually died a brutal death in the end.<br/><br/>Lastely one must consider that most people have not read the comic books so they would not actually know or care if the film wasn't completely faithful to the comics which therefore leads me to believe that when they finish watching the movie they will rate it according to how good a movie they thought it was, not how accurate it was to the comic or the genre of film. Therefore how has no one realised that incredibly and unrealistically stupid? Open your eyes people and actually watch the movie as opposed to laughing throughout it just because your friend who has an IQ of 10 finds an 11 year old hilarious.<br/><br/>Overall I was deeply disappointed with the film although in this final section I will give it some credit. The directing was actually pretty good and one scene in the movie (scene where Big Daddy kills everyone in the warehouse) was very well edited, however on the other hand it was made to look like it should be a part of a very gory and action packed film as opposed to an action comedy. Anyway ultimately it is up to you, the viewer, to decide whether you like this movie or not, but I will certainly NOT be recommending this to anyone"
"rico_scp","3","27","56","19 April 2010"," Waste of my time!
","The movie plot was nothing that I expected but that was not what made this movie terrible, it could give it a special touch. However the story tat followed was just boring and looked more like a childish Disney adventure with a predictable ending.<br/><br/>What I also disliked was the terrible acting of some characters. Nicholas Cage (after his terrible acting in Bad Lieutenant) showed here again that he is not a top actor. The characters that played the Mafia and the kid of the Mafia boss were also terrible.<br/><br/>This is a movie that I recommend only when you have really nothing to do and no other interesting movies are showing."
"sarakitty05","10","8","13","22 July 2012"," Great, shocking fun
","I gotta say, when I first started watching this movie, I thought it was your typical teenage boy kinda movie; about growing pains, and being a loser, and suddenly turning into a winner. Even when the main character started dressing up as a hero, i still thought, alright...he's a little eccentric.<br/><br/>However, a good ten to fifteen minutes in the movie, I found out I was dead wrong. The minute Nicolas Cage shoots his daughter (but she's fine) with a smile, i knew this was different than any movie I have ever seen. It was amplified double when those thugs stabbed Kick-Ass.<br/><br/>This movie, in all, is one wild ride. I don't want to give too much away, since that will ruin the shock factor for viewers (The above doesn't really give anything away). Aaron Johnson is BRILLIANT as a nerdy, loserish high schooler who turns into Kick-Ass, an alter ego who gets himself into more than he expects. Eventually, he turns from scared pussycat into a ferocious tiger, willing to do what it takes to save people from harm. Chloe Grace Moretz and Nicolas Cage define excellence as Hit Girl and Big Daddy. Two roles that I was definitely not expecting to see. It shocked me and it thrilled me, and it definitely made the movie so much better. They should have won awards. If you don't see this movie for anything else, please see it for these forces of nature. Finally, Christopher Mintz Plasse also plays a great role as Red Mist.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is up on my top 5. I won't say too much about it overall, except: GO SEE IT. YOU WON'T REGRET IT."
"bilromultimedia","10","6","9","21 July 2013"," Awesome!!!!
","This is by far one of the coolest flicks I have ever seen. It's well written, well acted, superbly done, and totally fun!!! Hit girl is like the ""Anti Robin"", totally sweet plot and background data. Big Daddy (a parody of the D.C. ""Batman"" character), was a perfect contrast to Hit Girl's persona, and to be honest - I liked Nick Cage better as Big Daddy, than I did as the ""Ghost Rider"", although I enjoyed that film as well (I actually liked ""Kick Ass"" a lot more than Ghost Rider - but I generally liked both films).<br/><br/>I recommend this movie 130%!!! You do not have to be a comic book Geek, or a veteran of many basement sessions of classic table top Dungeons & Dragons to be totally into this super hero flick. It should appeal to almost anybody. This film is a perfect blend of action, comedy, and drama - and despite managing to somehow pull off being a simultaneous parody of both Batman and Spiderman (i.e. ""Kick Ass""), it is an extremely original film, and thoroughly enjoyable to boot!"

","I thought this movie was gonna suck, it looked like a repeat of superhero movie (the main hero even has a similar costume) instead I got one of the funniest most entertaining movies I've seen in a while. I don't know how but I actually cared about the characters in this movie, unlike in most parodies, and some super hero movies (cough, cough, Fantastic Four.) This movie was actually better than most huge budget blockbuster superhero movies (this is coming from a big superhero fan.) I mean they made a move about a comic book geeks, Nicolas Cage, Mclovin, and a tiny ninja (I can't think of any better way to describe her) not seem so stupid you wanted to bang your head against a table. I don't think I should really tell much of the story all I can say is see it (just be warned it is violent and bloody, so not a little kid superhero movie.)"
"tim-jackson4","Null","6","9","26 December 2010"," It does kick ass
","Kick-Ass This comic book adaptation, full of violence, obscenity, computerized blood splashing, beatings, knifings, and wild stunts ends up as one of the best super hero comic adaptations I've seen. The half a billion-dollar Spiderman series directed by John Favreau could learn something from this simpler film. In part it's the great casting and cleverer attention to character. Obviously Favreau is hired to make sure the wise guy persona of Robert Downey and quality acting of the cast balance an effects laden production. But those performances still feel gratuitous and studied. Kick-Ass, on the other hand uses lesser-known actors to build more grounded characters, at least in the sense of nerds belying superheros. Its literal secret weapon is the outrageously wonderful 12 year old actress Chloe Grace Moretz (Let Me In) as Mindy/Hit Girl, and a cautiously underplayed Nicholas Cage as Her cartoonist-father/Big Daddy. Along with nerd specialist Christopher Mintz-Plasse, hunk-playing-geek Aaron Johnson as Kick-Ass, and a ripe posse of convincing goons, the movie leaps wildly from wild violent choreography to sweet cartoonishness. The fresh cast combined with the extremes of emotional commitment to a ridiculous plot are satisfying and continually surprising."
"lukehere99","9","7","11","4 August 2013"," Were gonna need a bigger review
","People say that superhero movies are only super if the heroes have powers, well this has an 11 year old saying the C word so screw you. Violent superhero movies usually work Watchmen was awesome, Super was pretty good, Defendor was decent, Kick-Ass is possibly the most bad ass movie ever to be made. Every single comic reader ever has considered donning a mask a cape and becoming a superhero. Kick-Ass addresses that and it's exactly what the main character Dave Lizewski does. He becomes an amateur superhero named KICK-ASS! So he goes out a couple of nights a week and fights crime. The movies average at this point and not really exciting, but certainly not boring. Then just before Kick-Ass is about to get beaten up Hit Girl arrives and massacres a load of guys, to the banana splits theme, with 2 samurai swords, whilst dressed as a superhero, at the age of 11! Before I saw this movie I thought that the most awesome movie character ever was The Comedian from Watchmen. Hit Girl makes The Comedian look like Scooby Doo, she's vulgar, she's deadly, she's totally bad ass and she's an 11 year old girl! But she's not on her own, Nicholas Cage himself plays her Batman like father who's secret superhero identity is Big Daddy. Big Daddy is obviously based on Batman, but he's a thousand times better.<br/><br/>Aaron Johnson is Kick-Ass and he's brilliant never did he stop being believable, Lyndsy Fonseca is his girlfriend and isn't as good as everyone else, but good enough. Nicholas Cage who hasn't had a good role since Con Air is back and he's bad! Well actually he's good, but he's bad as in so awesome. But really this is Nicholas cage's best role of all time, and he was very good as the lead in Con Air, which is not surprising because the last really good film he was in before Kick-Ass was also Con Air. Christopher Mintz Plasse (aka Mclovin from Superbad) has a new best role of all time, not only is he funniest actor in the movie. But he's believable as a comic book nerd, because he always plays nerds, because he's so good at it! Mark Strong is his dad (in the movie) Frank D'Amico and he's just one of the best movie villains ever, that's a fact. Now onto the star of the show! Chloe Grace Moretz as Hit Girl, as far as I know Chloe Grace Moretz's career is going well.... very well. She's going to be Carrie, she was in a Johnny Depp film when she was 14 and has plans to star in a movie coming out in 2015. We can safely assume that her career is going well, and that her careers success is mainly down to Kick-Ass. Before Kick-Ass she had been in a few minor horror movies and Big Momma's House 2. Yes you read that right, Hit Girl was in Big Momma's House 2. If you looked at all the movies she's ever been in and charted it, the popularity would go up very quickly after Kick-Ass, the reason for this is that Hit Girl suits her. I'm not saying that Chloe Grace Moretz is a murdering superhero who's dad is Nicholas Cage, but her age and appearance is the same as the character. If they had got a 16 year old to play 11 year old Hit Girl so there wouldn't be too much controversy about all of the cussing. That would have taken the adventurousness out of the movie, and would have looked stupid! So overall the acting in Kick-Ass is more than Oscar worthy - it's awesomeness award worthy. Now onto the plot, it's awesome. Now onto the special effects, a movie with so much violence and gore as Kick-Ass has to have a lot of CGI in it, because most of the fights are impossible in real life. But they did a brilliant job and I'm going to have to give them an awesomeness award for that too. But come on, that scene in the burning warehouse was so realistic that I was cooking bacon on my TV screen. Music is always an important part of a film, in Watchmen the music is the main reason I love it. And Kick-Ass did not fail at this either, it has one of the best soundtracks of all time, and if you took the epic song in the background out of that scene where the person dies *NO SPOILERS* it would be much less emotional. (Clue to the people who have the seen the movie but still have no idea what I'm talking about - it's the bit with the slow motion the fire and the flashing light).<br/><br/>Now I think I've covered most of the positive things I want to say about the movie - onto the negative points (point). I can only think of one negative comment on Kick-Ass and it's not even that bad. In my opinion the humour in Kick-Ass does not match the rest of the movie by way of awesomeness. That must be a bit hard to interpret if your not me. With Kick-Ass the stories awesome, the characters are awesome, the musics awesome, the special effects are awesome but the jokes are just pretty funny. I laughed more at Superbad than I did at Kick-Ass, but Kick-Ass is a better movie for different reasons. That is my only bad point about Kick-Ass, the jokes aren't as good as the rest of the film.<br/><br/>So I give Kick-Ass a 9.5/10. it is the best superhero movie of all time (in my opinion). This is my 5th favourite movie of all time and I recommend it to everyone on the planet."
"ferdibinger","9","7","11","2 April 2011"," See it as what it is, and it will kick your ass with entertainment!
","Let me start by saying I really enjoyed the movie a lot for its humor and entertaining value. It is not easy to make a movie that works so well on so many various levels and is so different from anything you have seen before.<br/><br/>This movie is not meant to be taken too serious. It is mainly a very well made and very entertaining parody and homage of numerous clichés in today's movies including genres like ""teen comedy, American gangster, superheroes"". Even though it uses these typical clichés it still manages to surprise the viewer by twisting them around in an unexpected way and by mixing them up with ""anti-clichés"" that break all rules like for example the characters of hit-girl and big daddy. <br/><br/>The movie is furthermore a satire about the degree of violence-entertainment in our societies (movies, TV-series,ego-shooters), while it at the same time not without self-irony admits, that violence included in stylish action scenes can be quite a big fun to watch and it provides us with it. <br/><br/>""Kick-ass"" does not make moral statements, it just reflects. It shows us how people influenced by today's media enjoy watching violence it shows us how we enjoy to watch it ourselves without pointing the moral finger at us. It is a reflection about moral courage as well, it literally asks us ""what would you do?"" again without judging us or judging the guy at the window, who just watches and does not do anything when the main character and his friend get robbed. <br/><br/>In the scene where Kick-ass defends a man against three other guys we can see all those people behind the window pane gloating over the scene (""It's ****ing awesome!"") and nobody is considering to help (besides maybe calling the police). And at the same time we are watching the scene ourselves and we enjoy the cool fighting scene together with the cool music. And we can ask what would we do in this situation? Would we help? Would we turn our eyes away? Or would we just watch as if it was a real movie? <br/><br/>Another similar scene is the life streaming of the brutal torture of kick-ass and big daddy. The really disturbing part here for me, besides the violence, was the realistic moment when the TV life broadcast is stopped and everybody jumps like crazy to the computers in order to not miss anything of the brutal execution. Why are they so eager to watch it? Hoping they might survive? Or is it simple out of curiosity and sensationalism? Again we can ask ourselves, would we be different? Until finally Hit-girl points a gun at us and tells us ""show is over mother*******"" Words the audience and maybe we as well might deserve.<br/><br/>For me kick ass manages to mix lots of different things, but still holds it together. Realism, pseudo-realism and unrealism for example are mixed together in an almost ridiculous way, so that it again feels like a homage to other movies. <br/><br/>There are the critiques who get so offended by ""a girl emotionless killing dozens of people"". The same critiques praise Kill Bill. Don't get me wrong I think Kill Bill is a great movie, but why would the violence presented in Kill Bill be tolerable but if it came from a little girl or against her it should be totally intolerable?? Furthermore are her fighting scenes extremely exaggerated and completely unrealistic. You cannot take them serious. They are just a parody of other extremely unrealistic fighting scenes, while not denying there are kind of cool anyway. Yes the scenes are very violent and gory, but so is Kill Bill, so are plenty of other movies. <br/><br/>""I don't want to see a girl slaughter other people in a movie"" could be translated as ""I don't mind people to be slaughtered in movies, but please stick to the political correctness and to what is tolerated by media mainstream."" If you get offended by violence in movies generally, OK you should avoid this movie. But if you get offended just by the fact that the violence you usually tolerate in movies is now performed by a little girl and against her, then well I really don't understand you and don't see what your point is. And if you are worried about children being affected by this movie in a negative way you should maybe blame the parents who don't prevent their children from seeing it, or the movie rating systems, but you should not blame the movie itself. Otherwise to be consequent you should instead be worried about all the much more brutal and frightening horror movies that are out on the market. <br/><br/>Facit: Great movie that is a funny and entertaining parody of typical movie clichés, and full with references to other movies. Nice soundtrack and entertaining fighting and action scenes. Reflects the enormous representation of violence-entertainment in today's media and the lack of moral courage in our societies. Great, convincing and funny performances by the five main actors in the roles of Kick-ass, Hit girl, Big Daddy, Red Mist and D'Amico.<br/><br/>9 out of 10"
"edcatfish","9","35","76","26 March 2010"," SICKENING VIOLENCE: just the way you like it!
","How I would've loved to entitle this review ""Kick-Ass!"" (get the double meaning), because it was! It was truly unique and lived beyond my expectations. It just had something of everything. In a nutshell - revolutionary.<br/><br/>Unfortunately this title is already consuming reviews in many variants. And though it's highly appropriate and a little contagious, it's just too easy to do. I'm fresh out of cinema, just having seen it in advanced screening. It was so good I'm still buzzing. I couldn't stop rambling about it to the friend I went to see it with, I enjoyed it so much. And by the way he wasn't able to stop talking about it either I guess he did too. I just had to review it! I've never read the comic by Mark Millar, I'm not really much of a comic book fan. However, I love a good movie. Having seen a trailer, I instantly thought this looked different to most of its genre. After seeing more trailers, it became one of my addictions. My interest keened on it. So I booked tickets as soon as I could and went to watch Kick-Ass.<br/><br/>Enough of my autobiographical account of my run up to seeing the movie. Here's some of the things you can expect...<br/><br/>Storywise Kick-Ass is quite simple. It brings us into the world of Dave Lizewski, a high school student and comic book nerd who yearns to become a real-life superhero. Not through some life changing event, neither through any actual superpowers. So he does. Despite parodying many, many superheroes who are referenced in the film (mainly by the protagonist himself (fittingly!)). It oddly retains a comic-book feel in structure from start to finish. Going as far as to use comic book captions throughout the film.<br/><br/>I'd say that Kick-Ass is in one sense a teen film. Not a cheesy one though. It carries the whole feeling of typical teenage life at that age in the film. The desire to act irresponsibly, sexual curiosity, immature jokes and social cliques. They all feature. At the same time Kick-Ass has some surprisingly mature and realistic themes and moral questions.<br/><br/>Now in other senses Kick-Ass is an action-comedy with hints of thriller and western. And it doesn't lay up on the action or comedy. Action is intense and brutal and often you can almost feel the hurt of the heroes. Comedy is top notch and should have you laughing at some daringly placed jokes. Or laughing inside at the nerdy/immature jokes. Use of some well known songs and movie themes at best-placed moments amplify Kick-Ass greatly. And though you'll most likely guess what's coming next, (some parts still come as a surprise) it's the way it's told that keeps you involved and loving it. My friend bought a large cup on Coke for the movie. He confessed afterwards that he was so taken in by the movie he'd completely forgotten about it! <br/><br/>I struggle not to give this a 10, which is a pity. It's so close but I believe firmly that there'll never be a perfect movie. Why is it a pity exactly? I saw Avatar at the end of last year. As Christmas drew close. I loved it and wrote a review, giving it a 9/10. But Avatar only just scraped a 9/10 in my mind. Kick-Ass was so much better. So there's my verdict! Go grab tickets and enjoy this stand-out movie while it's still in cinemas.<br/><br/>***Final Notes*** Though I guess some people may say this movie is ripping off Watchmen, they'd be very wrong. Though it has some basis in it, Watchmen was a very serious look at the idea of real-life superheroes. Kick-Ass is a lot more comical look at it. Detailing a world where the main character and others are very aware of the superheroes these vigilantes have based themselves off. Plus Dave Lizewski decides to become ""the wetsuit crusader"" because he wonders why no one else has tried something similar. Not because he's a psychopath."

"rmm_in_sonoma","Null","22","45","16 April 2010"," Something is very fishy here!!!
","Don't believe the rating of this movie – at least take it with a grain of salt. As many, I like to check ratings of movies before I go. Kick-Ass opened today (April 16, 2010), and it already has 7,900 votes. Yes, I understand that it may have opened in some markets early. While it may be an 8.5 star movie, I am wondering if the box has not been stuffed. What concerns me is that while females in the range 18-29 gave it an 8.5, and females 45+ gave it 8.0, I note that females under 18 gave it a 5.2, and females 30-44 gave it a 5.8. Maybe whoever was stuffing the box was trying to add ""random"" high and low stars, this is just statistically not plausible. Sure, there may be this kind of range from young to old, but I repeat, here the inner age group, 30-44 gave it 5.8, the shouldering age groups both gave it better than 8! Something is very fishy here.<br/><br/>Granted, this may be all legit, some statistical anomaly, but? And, or course, on reading this, maybe future ballot stuffers will be more adept.

","I purposefully try not to read too much about a movie if I might go and see it. I don't want to risk spoiling my experience by taking any preconceived ideas along with me. This was the case for Kick-Ass, I'd read some thing about it being something like ""self aware"" or something to this affect, whatever it was it appeared to mean to me that it was not a corny comedy directed at ""the average"" teenager but something a bit deeper. So I didn't read much more because I had decided that I might go see it. Admittedly this strategy hasn't worked out for me before as well.<br/><br/>Today I went to see Kick-Ass. Extreme violence perpetrated by a pre-pubescent girl peppered with foul language doesn't really impress me. The post-pubescent, but clearly lagging behind in the maturity department, behind me seemed to find these parts ""funny"", as did a fair percentage of the audience. I'll give the audience the benefit of the doubt though, often embarrassment is covered up by a burst of laughter.<br/><br/>Was this film that bad? No it wasn't terrible, it was just not very, or even much good either."

","This is by far the best movie that i saw in 2010 At first i was expecting a mediocre stupid movie but when i saw the note score on IMDb that was up than 8 i think i have to see it maybe its worth of it. Kick ass tells the story of a student that after seeing injustice transform himself in a superhero without powers it seems like its a little bored but after i watch the movie i realize it have most of i need: will, compassion, action, humor, good storyline, excellent cast and characters, excellent dialogues and in my opinion no other movie have all this in 2010. Another point i like to touch is that though i hate gory movies kick ass have the exact amount of violence to me though IMDb parental rate have gore 10/10 it isn't true for me its 5/10, this isn't saw or an horror movie but the shots and cuts looks a little realistic thats all besides the micro wave scene there's no scene that show gore and looks sadic. At some point of the movie it will rise your dreams of be a super-hero like we ever wanted to be<br/><br/>WATCH IT IS WORTH OF IT !!! however the film is not for kids i warn you; through the movie you will find the Strong's points of it and they're that it have excellent humor, detailed and excite action scenes, good humor and besides the 4 or might i say 3 hero's will steal the movie: (kick ass) with his strong will,(hit girl) will steal ours hearts with her bad-@ss action moves and innocence, (big daddy) will make us cold with her love for her daughter and for his thirst of vengeance.<br/><br/>If you ever readed a comic book or liked super hero's don't even think it GO AND WATCH THE MOVIE!! if you haven't then you will start to love hero's. I don't want to spoil the movie because its too good it make me remember that i still want to be a hero :)"

I was way off. Instead its a ten year old girl killing anything and everything for no reason and doing it in a bloody and torturous way. Why people enjoy this? I have no idea.

","This is an amazing movie filled with action as well as comedy. The name of the movie basically sums it up ""Kick Ass"".

Just me? Now this isn't the average movie you would see Nicholas Cage in but he surprised me at how well he play Big Daddy. Based on a comic book by Mark Millar, Kick-Ass follows the story of Dave Lizewski a high school student. Fan of comic books Dave decides to become his very own hero Kick-Ass. After performing a heroic deed Dave is the most viewed person on youtube. Others start to become superheroes including town rich kid Chris D'amico. This is an amazing example of how superhero movies are meant to be made. Amazing video fx, Great actors and intriguing story 9 out of 10 for this amazing superhero spectacle"

","Dave Lizewski (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) is an awkward high school loser who dreams to be a superhero. So he dresses up as Kick-Ass to try to fight crime. When he tries to take down drug dealers, he's overmatched and gets rescued by Mindy Macready/Hit-Girl (Chloë Grace Moretz) and her father Damon Macready/Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage). Chris D'Amico (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) has daddy issues with his crime boss father and dresses up as Red Mist.<br/><br/>The high school guys are likable and his infatuation is charming. I like Aaron Taylor-Johnson as the dorky lead. His whole story is sweet and cute.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage is strangely odd. His halting speaking style gets really awkward. His chemistry with Chloë Grace Moretz is just too peculiar. I understand it's all dictated by the mannered writing, but it's just not natural.<br/><br/>The movie does have an unusual take on the comic book hero movie. It's fun, violent, and irreverent.

"Desertman84","10","2","2","22 August 2013"," A Good Superhero Film
","Kick-Ass is a superhero comedy based on the comic book of the same title by Mark Millar and John Romita, Jr. It tells the story of an ordinary teenager, Dave Lizewski, who sets out to become a real-life superhero. It was directed by Matthew Vaughn. <br/><br/>The main character is geeky high-school student Dave Lizewski, who finds himself wondering why no-one has ever tried to be a real-life superhero. After turning himself into a ridiculously skinny streak of green and yellow named Kick-Ass - all he needed was a wetsuit ordered online - Dave takes to the streets to take on some bad guys. And subsequently takes a beating that almost kills him.Unbelievably, after a lengthy period of recuperation, Dave brings back Kick-Ass for another assignment. This time around, he is more successful, if not exactly effective.After someone posts a YouTube clip of a disguised Dave clumsily overpowering some muggers, the cult of Kick-Ass goes viral.Among those watching with extreme interest are two other amateur costumed crazies : the dynamically deranged father-daughter duo of Big Daddy and Hit-Girl. So mob boss Frank D'Amico had better watch out. He too is distracted by the sudden emergence of Kick-Ass, mistakenly thinking the mystery do-gooder poses a serious threat to his operations. While Frank dispatches his wimpy son to become Red Mist, a possible sidekick for Kick-Ass, Big Daddy and Hit-Girl move closer to executing the ultimate act of revenge. <br/><br/>For the most part Kick-Ass is witty, knowing and hugely fun.With its electrifying action sequences, a killer storyline and a maverick comic sensibility, the brilliance of the film will surely astound the viewer. The performances are excellent.In addition to that, the breakneck pacing does not diminish the intense impact achieved by some spectacularly splatter-some combat scenes.Also,the screenplay is incredibly well- written, simultaneously sending-up and shredding the superhero genre, while never under-playing the mere mortality of its own characters. This is certainly worth the price of admission."

","I scoffed at first when this movie was released because of the tiny girl unrealistically kicking butt. But I finally saw the whole thing on cable which tuned-down the ultra-violence a little and I saw a great movie. <br/><br/>Great story and unexpectedly funny. Great cinematography. It has a high-color comic-book look to it. Like someone laid the whole thing out comic-book style and then shot each frame for the movie. Storyboard I believe is what they call it. <br/><br/>But in this case, the creators insisted that the look of the storyboard, the action, the feel, the look, they insisted that it go up that way on film or video or whatever digital-computer stuff they use now. Fantastic job. I'm sure the uncensored version is really sick, but to many people today ""sick"" is good.<br/><br/>I did not know that Nick Cage was in this movie since it seemed that the star focus was on the young kids in the movie. Cage played his role very real. He passed onto the viewer the feeling that this is life in New York now and these things are really happening and he intends to do something about it. Like many good comic-books the movie is also funny. The New York Times called it ""giggle and guts entertainment"". That's it exactly. <br/><br/>Of course, this movie was excellent for that demographic that Hollywood wants to watch this so they can spread the word to their friends. Great writing and movie-making talent here in this very good movie. And I'm not even a kid anymore, but in the comic-book genre little kids can kick-ass."

","Kick ass was a film I was expecting very little from but it surprised me a lot. The humour is done perfectly and though it's sometimes dark humour I really felt it worked really well. The acting was brilliant too with Chloe Grace moretz stealing the show as the badass hit girl. She was funny and a complete badass as I said but she was by far the best character and a future star in Chloe Grace moretz.The scene where hit girl takes out the drug dealers was just pure awesome and showed some brutal yet satisfying kills and was choreographed superbly well. Nicholas cage is not one of my favourite actors by a long shot but I really liked his character though I felt he was a bit underdeveloped though this didn't affect the movie. I'm really looking forward to kick ass 2 which I will be seeing soon and this time I have high expectations.

"loganx-2","4","22","46","9 May 2010"," With Great Fanboyishness Comes Great Responsibility
","Everything before the appearance of Hit Girl was at least interesting, after that the head of the movie goes so far up its own ass, it can perform its own colonoscopy, which it then proceeds to do, as what I'm sure some would call satire. Mark Millar's hacky writing that's made him a 5th tier mainstream comic writer is present here as ever. If this is a good adaptation of the comic (which I gave up on after issue 2) then it's a faithful adaptation of a bad book. ""Mystery Men"" and ""Blank Man"" with a little girl who calls people a ""c&^t"" and plenty of references to YouTube-is that what's passing for edgy and original these days...agro Juno? The strain of creatively impoverished Millar writing can be traced from ""Wanted"", to ""Kick Ass"" and the Iron Man franchise. For instance, Samuel L. Jackson is in the new ""Iron Man 2"" because Millar had artists model their new Nick Fury after him in his ""Ultimate's"" comic's series. When Alan Moore says that modern comics are now just a spawning ground for bigger commercial properties and merchandise, Millar is looking more and more the eager grounds keeper. His books come with headshots in mind.<br/><br/>""With Kick-Ass, the books just out and now the movie's out six weeks later. And I think that's the way things are going to go now, because to go to Marvel's B and C-list characters and try to get movies out them – what's the point of that?""-Mark Millar. I know this is the way Kubrick went about ""2001"", but this ain't 2001. Concerning, B and C, characters I would gladly take a ""Howard the Duck"" sequel any day over Super-Bad kid doing the world's worst Batman quote at the end of a movie.<br/><br/>As for Mathew Vaughn as director, ""Kick Ass"" combines the worst of his last two films; the Guy Richie rip off of ""Layer Cake"" is now replaced by embarrassingly brazen Tarantino worship, and the stiffeled/self-congratulatory attempts at graphic-novel adaptation in ""Stardust"" is present and accounted for here. Vaughn financed the film himself, so calling this a soulless studio product isn't accurate or necessary. Bad indie movies get made too...agro Juno is actually more accurate than I suspected when I started writing this.<br/><br/>At the beginning Kick-Ass tells us how he isn't like your daddy's super-heroes no alien origins or dead parents to avenge, no powers or skills etc., but an hour later, were cheering on Hit-Girl's Matrix/28 Days Later/Silence Of The Lambs/Kill Bill reference laden revenge for her slaughtered father, and watching jet-packs streak across the sky. Roger Ebert went too far connecting ""Kick-Ass"" to Columbine and Virginia Tech. A movie can be bad without being the end of western civilization, and though Kick-Ass isn't very good. Children and Old people swearing will always have produce a knee jerk ironic laugh, like a fat man with high pitched voice, or a short person with a deep Barry White voice, and so Kick-Ass has it's moments of amusement(largely thanks to Nicolas Cage).<br/><br/>With great fan-boyishness comes great responsibility, and if super-heroes have any meaning at all, it should be about more than just kicking ass. If your reply to that ""But then what else is there?"", then just forget everything I've said, this is the movie for you."
"RCWjr","9","10","18","1 January 2011"," One of the best from 2010
","I held off placing a review of this film out here, mainly because I was lazy. But also because I wanted this film to fully sink into my consciousness. This is one of the few films that I can honestly say saw major rotation in my Blu-ray player. It is one of the gems from 2010.<br/><br/>Many comics are getting the film treatment nowadays. Few however see the transition done this well. Vaughn has taken the comic created by Mark Millar and turned it into a live-action treat.<br/><br/>Young Dave Lizewski, as played by the fantastic Aaron Johnson, just wants to make a difference. He has no super powers, no training to speak of, he just has a costume and a desire to do good. Johnson juggles the character of Lizewski/Kick-ass beautifully. From his dead-on American accent (those that don't know, he is English) to the wholehearted earnest desire to do right, Aaron Johnson has announced himself to the movie audience in a grand way. The film follows Lizewski as he sets about battling wrong in his town, while dealing with the same issues other teens are going through. It is this balance that makes the film fun to watch as you see him stumble through both his desire to right wrong, as well as capture the heart of a girl at school whom he has fallen for. The film follows Lizewski through all the par-ells that being a teen encompasses, with the added wrinkle of trying to be a ""hero"". <br/><br/>As good as Vaughn's direction is and Johnson's take on Kick-ass, this film is taken to new heights by the team of Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) and Hitgirl (Chloe Moretz). Cage and Moretz father/daughter relationship is what makes this film work. Cage goes from playing an eerily mousy father to channeling Adam West when he dons the cape and cowl of Big Daddy. Chloe Moretz, what more can I say that hasn't already been said. She, like Johnson, announces herself to the movie audience with one of the best introductory characters in the last decade. Big Daddy and Hit Girl have a very unorthodox relationship, one that is built on the father raising his daughter to fear nothing and give no quarter to those that would do harm. Her violence is equal parts unsettling and invigorating to watch. You will shake your head as you take joy in watching her in action, yet coming to terms that this is a pre-teen committing major acts of violence.<br/><br/>Mark Strong provides a wonderful screen villain for our heroes to battle. He seems to be making a niche in portraying villains, all different. His Frank D'Amico is dangerous, but is able to do this without resorting to camp that many actors go to when portraying comic villains. The person who goes a long way in stepping outside of previous roles is Christopher Mintz-Plasse. He plays Chris D'Amico / Red Mist, the son of Strong's Frank D'Amico, and pseudo partner to our heroes, far and away from the McLov'n characterization that he is most identified with. He goes a long way in putting that character behind him with this role.<br/><br/>This film was heavily marketed, but in the end did not do extremely well in theaters. I think many people who are not familiar with the comic and not informed of the film itself but only knew it from the trailers saw this as a comedy, when in all honesty the comedy comes organically from the situations that our characters find themselves in. It is not played for chuckles, it is played dead on serious. I think maybe some saw this as a comedy and shied away from it.It is a film which contains many elements that are hard for a general audience to accept and appreciate. The biggest being the violence. To Vaughn's credit, he did not pull back on the violence of the comic. A sequel was green-lit before the film hit theaters, I hope the box-office does not keep them from moving forward as it would be a shame not to see these characters mature in further adventures."

","Get in, sit down and buckle up for one of the worst movies of all time! Words cannot explain how bad this movie is. I don't know how it gets any decent ratings at all. Mix cheesy acting with an almost cliché type superhero movie and you have this. It was literally the worst movie I have seen this year. I was very apprehensive about watching another ""superhero"" movie. But through the reviews on here, and the actors in the movie, I thought I would really give it a go. Big mistake. It's not even worth TRYING to like. And the little girl in there swearing was not even remotely funny. It didn't add anything to the movie except maybe making a bunch of 12 year old viewers pee themselves. Speaking of 12 year olds, how come every male in that movie seemed to have a higher voice then most of the females? I mean it was just gut wrenching sitting there listening to 90 minutes of prepubescent punks whining. I mean I would have rather waited another couple years until they past puberty than listen to their annoying voices.<br/><br/>All in all though, I think they really tried to attract an audience of young teenagers. The movie didn't appeal to me at all and I am pretty confident it wouldn't to a lot of adults out there. <br/><br/>Now there's no point in revealing any spoilers - if you wanna waste 90 minutes of your life feel free to do that. But i don't even wanna call it spoilers. When u spoil something it means you made something go from good to bad. But this movie isn't good. It sucks!

"yellowporpoise","5","19","40","22 April 2010"," Over-hyped mixture of everything
","Let me start by saying: Do not believe the hype! It is not a bad movie, but definitely not an 8.5 movie and I hope I can explain my concerns.<br/><br/>First: This movie has not a consistent way of storytelling. You have parts that look like a teenage comedy and two minutes later the music changes and the look of the movie changes and suddenly you have a dark and heavy atmosphere. This change did not look artistic to me. It rather looked, like someone messed up different genres because he had no idea what this movie should look like. Teenagers are not allowed in this film and most adults will be bored by the teenage life of the lead actor. It is neither fish nor meat, it is inconsistent.<br/><br/>Second: To me the development of the characters was messed up too. It took 35 minutes to describe kick ass (although you knew after 5 minutes what this character is supposed to be), but it took only two minutes to describe hitgirl.<br/><br/>Third: The soundtrack is a reason why this movie is so messed up. In some scenes you had a real film score (when big daddy killed the people in the warehouse), that created an intense atmosphere, in other scenes you had some ""party music"" that was just inappropriate. Hitgirl just lost her father and two minutes later we have ""partytime"" again? To me the soundtrack did not help to make it a good movie.<br/><br/>Fourth: I love violent movies. I loved 300, I loved inglorious basterds and so on. I am not a wuss. A well done killing of evil gangsters is always welcome. But in this movie the violence did not help the movie to become something solid. Why putting the guy in the microwave? For what reason? Just to see him explode? Why killing the guy in the car compactor? Just for seeing him explode too? The big problem is again the inconsistence of the entire movie. If it would have been just a comedy, than fine. Would it have been just a dark movie like ""Dark knight"", than fine. But this strange clutter of genres destroys it and leaves the viewer helpless. Should I laugh, because the other people are laughing, although the scene is not funny? Should I feel something deep when big daddy dies? In some moments I thought, that I felt ""emotionaly raped"" in some strange way. Someone forces me to laugh about something that is just not appropriate to laugh about.<br/><br/>I could write much more (script, acting, cut...), but the result is: This movie does not know what it should be. The movie was OK, but my life would be a little bit better without having seen it."

","I saw this fellow's last movie. ""Stardust."" It was an idea full of potential but lacked coherence, soul. It took you a world (two worlds) that were puddles created by each craft. This is less incoherent, but still has no intent, no imperative in the world. Imagine a world in which imagination has no force. The irony is that the story is about a kid who simply by wishing made a world that would have him in it as a superhero.<br/><br/>So as a movie, leave it alone. But as an example of what I call clever folds, it is a gold mine. <br/><br/>Take the effect I just mentioned: dorky kid sits in front of a computer and masturbates every night. We are told that his fantasies can get pretty rich, and the we — maybe — enter one of those fantasies. Just so this particular device doesn't get old, we have him occasionally give us a voice over talking about the nature of the superhero and the unlikeliness of the fantasies.<br/><br/>Mixed into this fantasy are two standard movie devices that often host inner folds: the boy is dying and imagines his life as it might have been. In that future, he has a comic named after him, that his friends (and girlfriend) read in a comic store. The story then emerges from the pages.<br/><br/>Oh yeah. The big fold can come from that thread; the kid imagining a world, wherein he is dying and further imagines success, wherein a comic exists that drives his actions. Or alternatively, we have a meek man, a cartoonist who is making a comic that has the story that impinges on our kid's world. <br/><br/>We can have each of the comics generating the other, or both. In this second comic we have our impossibly rich and powerful villain, surrounded by dozens of cartoon guards, fodder for the ten year old. <br/><br/>This is a powerful idea, a story, and better a cartoon being created in the story and governing part or all of the story. Here we even have the cartoon ""come to life"" to give us some backstory. It is all powerful stuff, and could have been pulled off with a director that understood the nature of worlds. You have to have forces that drive things; otherwise it is all just a bunch of scenes that involve the same people.<br/><br/>It is probably impolite to mention the fact that the star of the fantasy is a ten year old girl with the biggest body count, most bloody deaths and foulest mouth. There is some dangerous and uncomfortable stuff here in terms of sexual tropes draped over this kid. The impolite mention is to notice that this is in the context of a teen body creating a sexual fantasy. We see tissues flying into a wastebasket. Definitely squirm material.<br/><br/>I have never seen a Marvel production that was worthy of recommendation. They just have this uncinematic, oppressive notion of how worlds work. Apparently knowing this, they formed Marv Productions to handle edgier stuff. They should try another tack.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."

","I was actually excited to see this movie. I thought it would be Super Bad meets super heroes, which should be hilarious. The cast seemed like a good one and everyone was giving it a great review. So I gathered up my parents for a family outing (we had all loved Super Bad) and proceeded to endure a painful two hours while being constantly worried about the confused and disappointed looks that I would be getting from my parents after the show.<br/><br/>The first 20 minutes or so were on the right track. A little slow moving, but at least attempting to be comedic. It's like half way into a ridiculous concept the writer/director/whoever decided ""Let's go serious with this!"" Are you kidding me? This could NOT be a serious movie and their attempt to make it so is what made it so painful. Nicolas Cage was like some overdone cartoon character, McLovin was wasted, his father's goons were completely unbelievable and everyone else I simply didn't care about. Sure, Hit Girl had a few good shock value moments, but that was about it.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie was super violent, super ridiculous and the whole revenge plot reminded me of Repo! The Genetic Opera, which is just about the worst movie ever made.<br/><br/>If you like ridiculous movies that aren't comedic and have a lot of violence, then sure, you'll like this. If you want at least a far fetched sense of realism, humor and substance, don't waste your time. I'm sorry I had to be the first one to knock this movie, but give me a break. NOT WORTH THE TIME."

The lewd language makes it unsuitable for kids and the fairytale ending makes it unsuitable for adults or sane people. One would expect this title to get a 2.8 rather than 8.2 which it currently has at IMDb. There is virtually no story line for the movie. This is rather a weird slap-stick comedy. The director tries to make up for this by adding a few pointless emotions to the end. In short this is one movie one would like to forget. Or better still not watch. Strictly avoid."

","Based on the Mark Miller comic book of the same title, British Director and Producer Matthew Vaughn brings his legendary filming talents (Stardust & Layer Cake) and sends all guns blazing in the extremely brutal and imprudent Kick-Ass. This is an action-adventure superhero movie with far-fetched but thrilling violence, extreme recklessness and a huge element of comedy.<br/><br/>""With no power comes no responsibility"", implied by the film's foremost protagonist Dave Lizewski (Johnson), a comic book enthusiast with an abnormal fetish for superheroes. His references to Bruce Wayne and Scott Pilgrim give the sense of realism and makes the comic geek trio seem like average college teens. His geeky ways slots him into Peter Parker resemblance, yet there are no spiders or no transformation of any kind. All it takes is a costly spandex purchase from eBay and automatically he becomes Kick Ass, a baton wielding ninja street hero with no heroic powers. His school girl crush Katy (Fonseca) is led to believe he is gay and due to his male stereotyped tunnel thoughts, he pretends the gay rumour is true. <br/><br/>Though Dave walks around with a ""kick my ass"" post-it on his forehead he can't help but hide within his alter ego and impress his girl. Aspects of Peter Parker still linger as he spends his spare time karate chopping the air (more appropriate than when he was jerking off to his teacher). It interprets clearly what real life is all about with unachievable dreams and violence on the streets 24/7. It also puts the audience into some familiar territory and gives an understandable plot with all of its post modern attributes.<br/><br/>Hit Girl, played ruthlessly by rising star Chloe Moretz, kicks some serious ass as she somehow blends the powers of matrix gun handling with the homicidal mind of Jason Voorhees. In a ""true to life"" film such as this, its hard to say she hasn't secretly been enhanced with some sort of turbocharged drug. For an 11 year old she sure knows her stuff, maybe a bit too much. Where a traditional girl her age would ask for a puppy on their birthday, she jokes about it and asks for a Filipino Balisong!<br/><br/>Cage adds an unfamiliar role to his resume as the ""built up crime escapee"" dad, classically going by the alias name Big Daddy, whose outfit is none similar to a spoofed adaptation of Batman and Night Owl. He spends the duration of the film hunting down the dangerous protagonist Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong), the rich crime boss of New York City with an army of guns at his finger tips. His son Chris D'Amico (Mintz-Plasse) is far from his McLovin ground, but still just as great. <br/><br/>Why hasn't anything like this been done before? Surely by now narratives are starting to repeat themselves, even with all this hype about Directors rebooting superhero films (Spiderman, Superman, even Daredevil). Working on a budget of $30m with no over exaggerated special effects, Vaughn hid himself from any distribution limits and independently funded the film. He had all intentions to dive into extreme boundaries and manages to avoid falling into the trap of trading expense for a trashy narrative. Instead he surrounds himself with college geeks, street thugs, crime bosses and aspiring hero's. Then throws in a ton of violence and a slightly altered superhero narrative, mixes it all together and turns it into a hybrid genre blockbuster. The sadistic violence may explain why Brad Pitt's name is in the credits testing out his talents for Producer.<br/><br/>This, in my opinion, has been the best re-creation of a comic book he or anyone else could have possibly done. In two simple words this film is bloody and brilliant! Kick-Ass can so easily blend the funniest of comedy moments, similar to that of Superbad, with intense violence that can only remind you of watching a late night Tarantino film. It uses similar conventions to that of Sin City and Watchmen where not only is it set in New York - Superhero block, but it's broad cast and considerably low budget slots it as an Indie film, whilst putting itself a fair distance away from all the Iron Man gadgets. <br/><br/>Vaughn shows he can clearly turn raw talent to stardom through the faces of Daniel Craig (Layer Cake), Mark Strong (the sadistic Septimous in Stardust). He's only had 3 seating in the Directing chair and from what we have seen so far, it's all masterpiece. With an X-Men prequel on the way and some new faces what's stopping the new cast from being the next Hugh Jackman or Halle Berry?!<br/><br/>Kick-Ass is a risky attempt from Vaughn and his ideas won't satisfy everyone in the world. The film is beyond the violence we regularly see in a 15, not to mention Chloe's ""foul mouth"" script, but it all adds up to a great, if not perfect film that focus primarily on fans of the ""Teen Comedy"" genre (those who can't get enough of McLovin with a gun). <br/><br/>Whilst it stays clear of any pastiche elements, Kick-Ass pulls on every possible string to place it beyond society's limits. Being a modern day game fan, I thought the POV scene of Hit Girls solo takeout scene backed up with the strobe-lighting effect was fantastic. I felt compelled to clap during the credits because I had become so hyped up. I haven't even mentioned the amazing score! Its sad to think this movie may never have been released due to its cruel nature. Stars have been found, new limits have been reached and Vaughn has realised you don't need super powers to create a super, super film. Outstanding!"
"Naylie","10","7","12","14 December 2010"," Kick-Ass is a badass movie (but in a good way)
","As a Marvel comic geek, you know what to expect in graphic books such as characters saving the world and defeating the bad guys, who sometime in most stories always gets the girl. But when a Marvel comic book gets turn into a live-action superflick movie, it gets a PG-13 rating right? Well all of them do....expect for one.<br/><br/>That tile I would highly called is Kick-Ass. Why? Because not only does the hero kicks the bad boys' asses, he also gets his own ass kicked too. (So you can see why they gave it such a funny title lol)<br/><br/>Based off the 2008 comics by Mark Millar, Kick-Ass tells the story about a high school kid named Dave who dreams about being a superhero, but it's not an easy job to do it. But once he does, he inspires others. Those others such as a father and a daughter named Damon and Mindy, who take up the names of Big Daddy and Hit-Girl, along with a kid around Dave's age named Chris who becomes Red Mist, but he isn't all what he appears to be.<br/><br/>As the movie-going fans, we all love watching a good superheroes fighting crime and busting villains. But why can't we have those in real life?<br/><br/>The creator's idea for Kick-Ass is quickly clever for coming up with an idea like that. Besides all of the action, and the blood gory fighting sequences, you would think that after seeing this movie, you were gonna wish you turn into a superhero yourself.<br/><br/>But it is not your average hero movie so it gets an R rating because of the strong language and the extremely hard-gore battling parts. So if you're used to watching highly gun-shooting-saving-the-world or comedy movies, then Kick-Ass is the perfect time to go see it."
"josephandrewmclean","9","7","12","12 December 2010"," Kick-Ass
","Kick-Ass had its Scottish Premiere as part of the Glasgow Magners Comedy Festival, with stars Aaron Johnson, from 'Nowhere Boy' and Christopher Mintz-Plasse or Mclovin from 'Superbad' as he will eternally be known in attendance for a question and answer session along with the Scottish writer of the comic Mark Millar. <br/><br/>Kick-Ass is the third outing for Matthew Vaughn as director, after making the gangster movie Guy Ritchie wishes he had made with 'Layer Cake' and then the fantasy star studded epic 'Stardust'. It seems Vaughn has made the transition from producer to director seamlessly. But getting his third movie off the ground was hard work. <br/><br/>Hollywood loves all things comic book just now, but 'Kick-Ass' was not following the trend, they deemed that it wasn't a kids movie and it wasn't quite an adult movie. With a UK rating of 15 it falls in between and unless you are a true fan-boy, it might not be the kind of thing to appeal to most people. So the studios held back on backing it, but undeterred, Vaughn used his producer skills to raise the $35 million budget independently and in doing so it gave him the freedom to make the movie he wanted. And what a movie he has made, any predetermined conceptions of what this would be like are not just shattered they are blown away. <br/><br/>Now with his third movie in the can, it should also prove to be his most successful and the gamble has paid off with talk from Millar of a sequel even before this goes out on general release. This confidence from Millar also shines throughout the movie from Vaughn's directing to some sublime performances that make you not just like this movie, but love it. <br/><br/>Kick-Ass is a comic-book movie unlike any you will have seen; it is violent, funny and shocking at times but above all it is utterly entertaining! Based on the comic book of the same name by Mark Millar, the story revolves around an American high-school geek and comic fan Dave Lizewski (played by Johnson with a fantastic American accent) who dresses up as a superhero to fight crime and in doing so becomes an internet sensation. But it seems he is not the only vigilante out there, he soon finds out that father and daughter duo Big Daddy (played by Nicolas Cage, doing a fine Adam West impression) and Hit-Girl (13-year-old Chloe Moretz) are also doing their bit to fight crime. <br/><br/>This pair steal the show from their brutal yet hilarious scene involving Cage teaching his daughter Mindy how to take a bullet while wearing her bulletproof vest. To a rather controversial scene that involves Hit-Girl's use of the 'C' word while wiping out a den of drug-dealers. <br/><br/>This shows the freedom Vaughn had in making the movie, after he managed to secure funding. In turn freeing this movie from the restraints of a big studio and it really pays off. Vaughn has assembled an eclectic cast that reads like a who's who from his previous outings, with stars such as Mark Strong in fine form. But from all the performances the film will be remembered for Chloe Moretz's first major role. Her performance goes from cutesy Daddy's girl to foul mouthed superhero and she more than holds her own with such an ensemble cast, she steals every scene she is in. <br/><br/>'Kick Ass' breaks the mould in superhero movies.It may be controversial but it is ultimately extremely funny. He may have incurred the wrath from such bastions of good taste as the Daily Mail, but Vaughn deserves plaudits for staying true to the comic book and giving us a superhero with a potty mouth."

"rantinghuman","1","18","39","24 July 2010"," an appalling movie you don't need to see
","We watched the better part of Hollywood's latest pile of filth called ""Kick-Ass"", before its mindless, gratuitous violence drove me from the theater before it ended. As we went up the aisle to leave, I stole a glance at the dark faces in the theater and wondered if any of them chuckled in a similar manner when they saw videotaped beheadings of abductees in Iraq, where men screamed for prolonged periods of time because it took that long to saw through the bones in their necks. For many of all ages, this has actually become entertainment. Would it take something tragic like this to happen to someone in their own lives before they snap out of their misdirected notions of entertainment? People have become so insulated from reality that they've lost the concept of what torture and killing actually are.<br/><br/>I never for a moment understood the appeal of slasher movies and I quit watching commercial TV because it is so permeated with jaded rot, but we all know about today's crime shows that depict the most gruesome killings imaginable, and a wildly popular show that actually glorifies serial killing. Hollywood even made a slasher musical that passes itself off as ""serious"" and ""artful"". But even a repulsive film like ""Sweeney Todd"" had some originality and cinematic virtue, endless scenes of slit throats and splattered blood notwithstanding. But ""Kick-Ass"" had none of this. ""Kick-Ass"" was just adolescent pap that laughs at torture. Nicholas Cage was nothing but a poor portrayal in a used Batman suit. Even more repulsive was corporate Hollywood's device of using a cute, trash-talking hero girl to draw in younger audiences (like my daughter, which is why we went). What it did instead was inspire my daughter to pledge to sell her Playstation 2 and its equally mindless depictions of violence. Not wanting to let a good thing pass by, I handed her instead a pick-axe and safety glasses, and she made the sparks fly off that piece-of-crap ""toy"". She made me proud.<br/><br/>It is perplexing how otherwise intelligent and kind people that I know, love and somewhat respect, can be so easily misdirected into believing that moronic filth like ""Kick-Ass"" is entertainment."

","A lot of people seemed to like this movie, thus the 8.3 rating, but Kick Ass didn't really hit the right chord with me.<br/><br/>I feel like the characters weren't developed nearly enough, leaving me indifferent to the bad guys and unsympathetic towards the heroes. For example, the scene where hit girl kills Razul (and others), I'm left wondering why she had to kill these menacing, but not exactly evil, thugs.<br/><br/>Some people have complained about the violence of this movie, but truthfully, there have been worse things out there. The issue I think, was that because the bad guys didn't seem THAT bad, killing them seemed tasteless and wasn't enjoyable to watch. (Granted, the scene where Hit Girl tries to save Big Daddy and Kick Ass was pretty damn awesome) Anyway, bottom line. The baddies weren't bad enough, the goodies weren't good enough, story needed developing."

Seeing that Nick Cage is involved I turned my expectation down a few notches just so that I won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>And I was still disappointed.<br/><br/>How do I express my utter disgust at the supremely ugly visual, of a young teen - and a female one at that - being systematically groomed by an aging daddy figure into a cold calculating murderer... A little girl who graphically stabs her sharp long phallic appendages into the fleshly bodies of other supposedly criminal hence unpardonable humans. Or subhumans. Daddy will be SO proud. Awwww how adorable.<br/><br/>The world totally need more senselessly-murdering psychopaths! Let's hope all little girls grow up ""strong"" like this one! Yay!<br/><br/>The spectacle of dehumanization of a cute little girl can be enjoyable for some, I guess. They do that kind of ""de-souling"" transformation to meak little females in certain fascist camps with great success. Apparently in the 21st century it is becoming cool again.<br/><br/>The more inane wannabe-cool lines she mutters post her casual killing acts, the uglier and less cool she became. Soon after she ""came into her stab-happy self"" the entertainment stopped for me - here's just Tarantino's glorified murderous sociopaths in hot chick suits transposed into a glorified teenage psychopath, but with even less justification for blood.<br/><br/>Kick Ass is but a ""reversed"" child snuff porn. And a contrived humorless one too. The way she kills, so casually and so smugly, the way she talks, so smart alec clever and super annoying, a kind of perverted soul-less little sister some lame-ass father or brother would love.<br/><br/>Apparently that's all the movie producers could conjure of What Makes a Little Prepubescent Teenage Girl Interesting. If we can't make her have sex just yet, at least we could make her kill other adults. That would be fun! Girls secretly wish to kill everyone too, guys secretly get a kick out of alpha killer queens, people will love it! So they reckoned... <br/><br/>The little girl is either an object to be raped and killed, or one who castrates and kills. Apparently that is SO COOL.<br/><br/>For me....yawn. <br/><br/>If I had a little sister or a daughter who thinks Chloe's casual-murdering behavior is so cool, or confuses vacuous smugness as profound cleverness, straight to the advanced psychotherapy ward she goes.<br/><br/>1 star for humorless snuff pretending to be cute and heroic.

","Now, here's a seriously screwy superhero movie that definitely had its head right up its ass. I think that a more appropriate title for this utter nonsense would've been ""Stupid-Ass"".<br/><br/>It really made very little sense to me why Dave Lizewski felt that he had to literally play out his little, comic-book fantasy in real-life. By becoming a superhero (who, by the way, possessed not a single super-power), was he really so frickin' deluded and beyond common-sense thinking that he couldn't see the incredibly dangerous mission that he was about to embark on (even after he had been stabbed and beaten)?<br/><br/>Like, was little Davie Lizewski's life really so unsatisfactory that he felt the need to draw this sort of screwy attention to himself? Wasn't ejaculating into countless tissues enough to fulfill his superhero wet-dreams? <br/><br/>If Lizewski was really so hell-bent on bringing the bad guys to justice, wouldn't it have been so much more easier and a heck of a lot less life-threatening just to have called 911 on his cel and then let the cops handle the hardcore stuff? <br/><br/>And, speaking about that dynamic-duo of Big Daddy & Hit Girl - Like, what sort of a totally demented message was that business sending out to parents and their kids? <br/><br/>So, here we have a seriously fukked-up father who trains his 11-year-old daughter to be an utterly ruthless, insensitive, foul-mouthed killing machine. And never once do the questions of morals, or ethics, or common-sense thinking ever enter into the horridly violent actions of the bitchy, purple-haired Hit Girl.<br/><br/>(And the father is never in the least bit concerned about his daughter's safety. And the daughter never questions herself or her father about what she is doing) <br/><br/>I personally viewed Hit Girl, and her blasé attitude towards what she was doing, as being worse than the most vicious bully on Earth. But, because she was looked upon as a ""crimefighter"" (self-appointed and self-righteously sitting on the side of the law) her savage, bloody murders were deemed as ""OK"".<br/><br/>Yes. I do realize that this picture was, indeed, a ""Comedy"". But, from where I was sitting, I found its humour-factor to be extremely callous and cold-blooded in nature. This film, pretty much, amounted to being nothing but a one-note joke that literally stretched the point of its ""jesting"" to the absolute limit. And because of that, this film just couldn't sustain the insane momentum that it was creating and so it snapped under its own unbearable weight.<br/><br/>And, finally - What struck me as very puzzling about this picture was that (due to its graphic, over-the-top violence and its non-stop use of profanity) it was a film clearly meant for an ""over 18"" audience. And, yet, in spite of that, I found its basic story-line was, without question, geared to an age group that fell significantly below the age of 18.<br/><br/>Yes. Very odd. Indeed!"

","It is clear that Mathew Vaughn is one of the most promising British directors at present. His debut, Layer Cake, showed the glossy veneer and seedy underbelly of London with a stylised high sheen look and showed flourishes of brilliance - the opening sequence reminiscent of Fincher and the action never replacing the narrative. Stardust showed that he could create an alternative reality that was believable considering its meagre budget. With Kick Ass, the action is rooted in reality. Posing the question ""why does nobody become a superhero?"" it follows a slightly different narrative than the comic book as its protagonist, Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson), considers the point with his friends and finally becomes one himself - Kick Ass. Foremost, Vaughn handles the action sequences with great competance: the shoot-outs are at times pure Hong-Kong action, other times truly original and the rescue scene is breathtakingly beautiful in its composition. We believe that a twelve year old Hit Girl could do all these things and you wince when the punches, blades and other assorted weapons are thrown. The action is also punctuated with dark and bloody humour throughout, you don't tire of seeing Kick Ass getting his ass kicked or Hit Girl impaling villains and uttering some truly blue language - much will be said of both, but this is a comic book film... fictional reality mean anything to Daily Mail readers? The casting of all characters is spot on, as a lover of the comic I was impressed at how they had translated the characters and their drama to the big screen. It is also worth noting that none of the sharp dialogue and spot on representation of teens is lost from the comics, they are believable teenagers that also look the age they are playing. However, Vaughn seems unsure as how to structure the film; one minute the death of a main character and the next, more laughs as Hit Girl swears and punches some more. The whole film seems disjointed, like reading a comic issue by issue and not as a book. One scene doesn't always appear to fit the next as if part of the previous scene was missing. Don't get me wrong, I thought the film was excellent but not perfect as I had expected from the hype surrounding it."

I hardly ever say this, but I feel like there was too much story and not enough action. I felt there was too much immaturity in the movie. Granted, it was about young superheroes, but to me, when a movie has more mature language and violent scenes, I expect a little more maturity in the plot line. Kick-Ass'(the boy's) storyline was just not really all that great in my opinion, especially the ""love"" story part (what a joke). I do understand that this movie is not to be taken too seriously, but too much immaturity can be annoying/sickening to sit through. I did like Hitgirl and Big Daddy, but there wasn't enough of them in the film, I think, to make a big enough impression.

"Al_The_Strange","10","5","8","24 August 2012"," ""At some point in our lives we all wanna be a superhero.""
","For the past hundred years (more or less), superhero lore has emerged as a type of modern day mythology, depicting these fantastic tales of romanticized vigilantism where all the heroes have some kind of incredible power and they use it for the greater good. But let's be serious: there is no such thing as a real superhero. In this day and age, however, some people have been inspired by the comics and films and have taken to the streets, dressed in costumes, to fight crime and help the communities.<br/><br/>In light of this, ""Kick-Ass"" is a story that eschews the fantasy and candidly faces the facts. This is not a world where people like Batman, Superman, the X-Men, or whoever can save the day and get the girl completely unscathed. Nor is it a world where everything is a concrete black-and-white good-vs-evil affair. Crimes happen and people often just look on without bothering to intervene. Real heroes get the snot beaten out of them, and can even die; there is no invincibility, only vulnerabilities. The film shows all of this straight-up, approaching the subject of masked vigilantism in a light that's far more realistic than most other superhero films to date (a few other good contenders being ""Super"" and ""Watchmen"").<br/><br/>However, this film is not all about the realism. In fact, realism in superhero lore is just something the film harps on sarcastically. The film has its share of crazy action, extreme violence, and includes some scenes that are just too crazy to happen in real life. The film is also quite the comedy, loaded up with funny lines and situations that are so sad that they're funny (or just plain funny). It pulls a lot of punches, delivering a shock and awe style of entertainment that will likely offend the most sensitive and conservative of viewers (this film will likely be forever notorious for showcasing an eleven-year-old girl cutting people up and cursing like an adult: you have been warned!). At the same time, the film is colorful and upbeat, contrasting heavily with the messed-up violence and situations; the poignant combination of light and dark is part of what makes the film so funny, so provocative, and so thrilling.<br/><br/>No matter how offensive or unbelievable things get, the story still matters, and it is quite strong. With the premise mentioned above, it does invoke some thought concerning masked vigilantism. It also ties in with the character and helps weave a tale of the characters' origins. The film follows the comic pretty closely, with only a few liberties taken (including an alternate take on the love interest, which I find better in the film than in the comic).<br/><br/>The film is certainly stylish, with quality photography and unique editing effects. There is one scene I find quite erratic with its use of strobe lighting, but it is mercifully short. Acting is good: Aaron Johnson, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Nicholas Cage, and Mark Strong all fulfill their respective roles really well. Exceptional praise goes to Chloe Moretz, whose performance for Hit Girl shows remarkable physical aptitude and skillful nuance (in addition to putting up with the vulgar script). Writing is not bad, cursing and all. This is one of those movies that looks more expensive than it is; all of the sets, props, and costumes look snazzy, with just a few weak spots. There is a plethora of interesting musical choices in this film, and they all help in the experience.<br/><br/>While I find that the vast majority of superhero films entertain one way or another, ""Kick-Ass"" is a one-of-a-kind feature that entertains by shattering the standard conventions and smacking the viewers upside the head. Chances are that some of you viewers will find this distasteful; if you are easily offended, then you should probably avoid this film like the plague. For most everybody else, it comes recommended! 5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Story: Very Good | Film: Very Good)"

","Kick Ass<br/><br/>Talk about the greatest superhero movie you will ever see. When you get to the theaters you are thinking is this movie going to live up to the hype? Is it as humorous as the trailers portrayed and last but not least is it also action-packed? All I can say is... yes, yes, and yes it lives up to these expectations and more this move is phenomenon. Now some people try to bash this movie by picking apart the movie, but most of there arguments are just pathetic and ridiculous; there is no way you could dis a movie of this caliber without making yourself look like a complete fool. Okay its time for the plot now here is kinda brief description of the movie and it might contain some spoilers.<br/><br/>The main character is Dave Lizewski who is your everyday high- school student. He doesn't have too much expectations and his life is about as mundane as you can get until one day he decides ""Hey I want to be a superhero."" His superhero name is Kick Ass but like I said before he is a everyday high schooler with no training what so ever. He fails epically on his first attempt and ends up in the hospital, but later on in the movie he meets Big Daddy and Hit Girl who are way better at being hero's. So all three of them start fighting crime and the main antagonist Frank D'Amico doesn't like this at all so he goes out of his way to try to stop them.<br/><br/>The actors did a great job I would say so myself. Aaron Johnson (Dave Lizewski) for an example is British and he had to use an American accent through the whole movie which would of been pretty hard. <br/><br/>I would recommend this who like hero movies and comedies, but if you're a parent you might not want your kid watching this movie because this movie has strong brutal violence and its gory. This film deserves 5 stars (out of 5). Go buy it now its probably the best thing you can do with your money!"

","This is an awesome movie because it doesn't take a graphic novel or comic book series and butcher it (i.e. Spiderman, loved the first two differences aside but the third was disgusting.) or the X-Men. Although varying in places from the comic books in which it's based, Kick-Ass stays true to the source material much more often than it doesn't, resulting in a great mixture of comedy, action, and suspenseful scenes that make you wonder what's going to happen next.<br/><br/>For those of you who think the violence is over the top and too graphic, you need only watch movies like Watchmen or any other R-rated comic-book film. Chances are the violence is there because it was there in the comics, as is the case with Kick-Ass. Dumbing down the violence for a movie based on an equally violent comic would be doing the true fans of the series a great injustice and at the end of the day, those who decide to tackle movies based on comic-books are often great fans themselves.<br/><br/>If you don't enjoy a lot of graphic violence, you can opt out of seeing this movie, but remember it's not there to be ""hip"" as some reviewers are saying, it's there because it's supposed to be there to keep the movie faithful to the source."

He wonders why no one has ever attempted to become a superhero in real life, so he decides to become the superhero Kick-Ass. At first, things do not go very well, but he eventually becomes an Internet celebrity and gets in way over his head. During all of this, he tries to impress Katie Deauxma (Lyndsy Fonseca), a pretty girl in his class.<br/><br/>A sub-plot, however follows a young girl, known as Hit Girl (Chole Grace Moretz), and her father, known as Big Daddy (Nicholas Cage). They are after the crime lord of the city, Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong), because he framed Big Daddy as a drug dealer, and it lead to the death of his wife.<br/><br/>In a final sub-plot, Chris D'Amico (Chistopher Mintz-Plasse), the son of Frank, wants to become a mob boss like his father, but his father neglects his hopes to follow him.<br/><br/>Everytihg about this movie is done very well. The characters are well developed, and you feel bad for them in some sense, and the actors who portrayed them did awesome. The action scenes are fun and graphic, with great choreography and special effects. The music is epic, helping to keep the mood throughout. The story, as explained above, does get more complex, but is never hard to follow, and is very realistic.<br/><br/>I will say, I find it very refreshing to see a superhero movie that is so brutally realistic. You should definitely see this movie, if you love superhero, action, or comedies."
"jimbo-53-186511","8","3","4","19 February 2014"," It's by no means a perfect film, but there aren't many films that are this much fun to watch
","Dave Lizewski (Aaron Taylor Johnson) is basically a high school loser who no-one seems to notice (especially girls much to his dismay). He's a drip who only really has 2 friends Todd (Evan Peters) and Marty (Clark Duke). Although they are his friends, they also think that he's a bit of a loser. Dave discusses why no-one has ever become a superhero with his friends and Todd and Marty raise several objections, but Dave isn't deterred and buys himself a superhero costume. Initially, Dave does this due to being fed up of being bullied and due to everyone else standing by and doing nothing. However, Dave becoming a superhero known as 'Kick Ass' potentially has far more serious consequences than he ever could have imagined.<br/><br/>This is another example of a film that is best divided up into good and bad (but believe me the bad points are relatively minor and the good far outweighs the bad).<br/><br/>THE GOOD; Once Dave becomes Kick Ass, the film becomes really funny. His ineptness and self training that he gives himself was a joy to watch (from his knowledge of reading comic books). The very fact that he also walks round in public with his superhero costume was also a great parody as we all know that 'real' superheroes only don their costumes when absolutely necessary and certainly wouldn't parade around busy streets in their costumes in broad daylight. Like other superheroes Dave's natural persona as opposed to his superhero persona is somewhat geeky and the way that Taylor Johnson managed to balance his 2 personalities was a joy to watch. It was also funny to see Dave wrestle with his hormones when a girl he likes called Katie (Lyndsey Fonseca) takes an interest in him. Sadly, for Dave she is only interested in him because she thinks he's gay and feels that he is someone that she can confide in. Dave and Katie end up together romantically, but for once this romance didn't feel contrived. She said openly that she wanted someone like 'Kick Ass' and when she discovers Dave is 'Kick Ass' she falls for him - it works. There are others things going on is this film; we also have Big Daddy (Nic Cage) and his daughter Mindy Macready (Moretz) acting as vigilantes to avenge Frank D'Amico (Strong) for setting Big Daddy up and for making his wife take her own life. The film provides a balance of everything; humour, stupidity, character developments, interesting plots and sub plots. A lot of films that have this much going on have a tendency to get a bit messy, or they tend to focus on some aspects more than others. For me, Kick Ass managed to balance pretty much everything perfectly and I thoroughly enjoyed the product as a whole. The funniest part for me was when Dave/Kick Ass started shooting all D'Amico's goons whilst wearing a skypack with Elvis's Glory, Glory Halleujah playing in the background. That was one of the funniest scenes in the film and one of the funniest things I've ever seen. It's not often I really LOL during a film, but that particular scene was genius.<br/><br/>THE BAD; OK, time to get a bit more serious now; there is the moral argument of a father choosing to involve his very young daughter in his vigilante killing spree. This plot device was driven more to create humour (which in fairness it does), but no rational parent would risk putting their child in harm's way so I found this aspect of the film hard to swallow. As believable as the romance was between Dave and Katie, it was every bit as bad between Marty and Erika - there was no chemistry between the latter two and no real reason for them to be together other than to create a happy ending.<br/><br/>FINAL SUMMARY; A great film which combines humour, stupidity, good plot and generally good acting from the principal cast. The star of the show for me was Chloe Grace Moretz who was outstanding considering she was only 13 years old when this film was made. I loved this film and will be watching the sequel very soon!!"
"Horst_In_Translation","8","3","4","19 September 2013"," Funny and clever take on the superhero genre
","This film was released right in the middle between the second and last film of Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy. And it was much more than just a filler. It's violent, vulgar and completely hilarious and I like it a lot when they manage to add comedic charm to superhero films, especially as they're usually really long and the occasional laugh brings nice relaxation and makes it easier to focus on the heavier scenes. I believe Matthew Vaughn succeeded with pretty much everything he wanted to achieve. The teenage coming-of-age background makes it easily accessible for students while the superhero-story is another great take on the fantasy genre (although, in fact, it really isn't fantasy). There's a love story involved, some pretty emotional scenes related to it, to which we all can relate and some genuinely sad moments in the second half too.<br/><br/>Another thing I really liked are the costumes. That tight green lizard-like dress the main character is wearing is the perfect example of what applies to his and all the other superhero outfits. They're pretty cool, but also equally colorful and definitely did not take themselves too seriously, which fits right in with the tone of the rest of the film. Same can be said about the costumes of Hit-Girl, Big Daddy and Red Mist. Nicholas Cage delivers possibly the most emotionally investing performance of a Batman-like avenger, who's been smacked in the face by life one time too many including his job struggles, his prison time and his wife's fate. His scenes with Moretz' character and the father-daughter bonding with the occasional laugh have more heart than an organ bank and are one of the main reasons why this turned out so well. I have not read the comic book, but the way she portrayed Hit-Girl and of course the costume as well makes her easily on of the biggest cult characters of the 21st century.<br/><br/>Mark Strong gives a good enough villain performance as a ruthless mobster boss and so does lead actor Aaron Taylor-Johnson. For the good guys obviously. The scenes where he unknowingly approaches disaster while he drives Red Mist to the warehouse and later on to Big Daddy are among the most tense moments the film has to offer and I also liked a lot the shot near the end when he flies off with Hit-Girl and has actually turned into a true superhero. The ending implied that audiences better get ready for a sequel and so it happened. Just a couple weeks ago, the second Kickass film was released. I haven't seen it yet, but this film definitely made me curious to watch it. It's a fun-ride from start to finish and is well-acted and -written down to the most interesting details like the teddy cam, the bazooka parts or the scene at Rasul's place."
"Joxerlives","9","3","4","20 August 2013"," A truly original superhero film which has its' cake and eats it
","Where to begin? I have to say I was never that fussed on the whole nerd-to-hero side of this film, when I watched the DVD I basically fast forwarded through a great deal of that. Hit-Girl steals the whole damn show and deservedly so, they could ditch the entire Kick-Ass storyline and just make the film about Hit Girl and Big Daddy, the character of Kick-Ass himself only really shines in the finale when he finally comes to the rescue (twice!). Good stuff? Plenty to go around, Nick Cage's fantastic Adam West impression is bloody wonderful although I'm sure entirely lost on most of the target audience who think Christian Bale is Batman. They should definitely get Adam and Burt Ward to guest star in the sequel. The 'crazy' dance scene in the Mistmobile and the 'I know!' scene with Kick-Ass's nerd friends and the hot girl in the diner cracks me up every single time.<br/><br/>But ultimately this is Hit Girl's film and she shines throughout convincing both as an ordinary sweet girl who loves her dad and death-in-pigtails. I have to say the violence isn't as shocking to me as the swearing, to hear an 11 year old use the C-word and MF word left me pretty speechless. You have to question Big Daddy's motivations, it's one thing to seek revenge himself but to drag his 11 year old daughter into it too? Hard to watch Hit-Girl getting stomped by the villain at the end, actually cheered out loud when she was saved. Big Daddy's death scene is also quite affecting and well played. The ending is great, she lost her dad but fulfilled his dying wish and now has friends, a loving guardian and an ordinary schoolgirls life, she can get that puppy and Bratz doll instead of playing with butterfly knives.<br/><br/>Truly interesting thing is that this breaks two of the golden rules of superhero films. Firstly we have a truly asexual heroine. When was the last time you ever saw a super-heroine who wasn't also a sex-goddess whom everyone drooled over all the time? Even Wonder Woman's little sister Wonder Girl was clearly a nymphet. But Hit Girl is 11 years old and thus entirely non-sexual (and if you disagree, seek therapy). When she dresses as a schoolgirl to gain entrance to the villain's lair it's to emphasis her innocence rather than exploit any sexual fetish. Although you have to wonder what they will do in the sequel when she will be in her mid teens? <br/><br/>Secondly they use guns. Unwritten rule of superheroes is that they don't use guns but Hit Girl and Big Daddy obviously read The Punisher rather than Superman or Spiderman. Kick-Ass eventually joins them, becoming a full blown vigilante and killing at least three people. Ultimately unless you genuinely have superpowers nothing beats lead (or bazookas). <br/><br/>So, great film and I can't wait for the sequel."
"3xHCCH","7","3","4","20 August 2013"," Be Ready for Graphic Violence from an 11-Year Old Girl!
","I never got to watch ""Kick Ass"" when it was first released in 2010. Now with the sequel in local theaters this week, several people recommend that I should probably watch this first installment first before I watch Part 2. So I did.<br/><br/>I did not know exactly what this film was about so I was surprised when this film and its sequel had posters of what looked like kid superheroes, yet the rating is R-16! Now that I have finished watching Part 1, the answer is very clear.<br/><br/>""Kick Ass"" tells the story of Dave Lizewsky, a nerdy guy who decide that he wanted to be a real superhero like those in the comic books he loves to read. He buys himself a dorky green uniform and tries to fight petty criminals around town as Kick Ass. Unfortunately he had absolutely no fighting skills. <br/><br/>However, his exploits apparently inspired a ultra-war-freak father- daughter team to don superhero uniforms themselves as Big Daddy and Hit Girl. Can these new superheroes stand up to the very real threat of the evil crime boss Frank D'Amico, his son Chris (who also took on a superhero persona Red Mist) and their entire gangster organization?<br/><br/>While Aaron Johnson does well as the titular character Dave/Kick Ass, the more memorable actor and character in this whole film is Chloe Moretz as Hit Girl. It was disconcerting to see a real 11-year old girl do all the killing Hit Girl did because this film did NOT sugarcoat any violence. THIS IS GRAPHIC STUFF! OK, it is CG but still very bloody graphic. However for some perverse underlying reason, Hit Girl was great movie character! <br/><br/>This movie sets up Part 2 very well, and yes, I am now quite excited to watch it as well. Now I know exactly what I am getting into. I am eager to see how the lessons Kick Ass and Hit Girl learned about being heroes here in Part 1 will affect their characters in Part 2. I am also itching to see how Red Mist steps up his game to be a worthy adversary."
"Robert_duder","8","3","4","10 August 2013"," Living up to its name, it does kick some serious...
","I remember when Kick-Ass came out and it was like instant cult status. Everyone was talking about it. For whatever reason it didn't seem all that important to me and I didn't see it. Ever since then this is one film that people BUG me constantly for having not seen. Well, the sequel is due out next week and since 2010 I have become a HUGE fan of Chloe Grace Moretz so I finally decided to give it a go. What a wild fun ride this was!! In many ways I think Kick-Ass is the ultimate super-hero spoof movie. They simply don't even know how to make spoof movies anymore but this one is smart and subtle in its style but in your face outrageous in the same breath. It is gratuitous in every sense of the word. It is ridiculously violent, the language is outrageous and for whatever reason it works perfectly in this film. It is an adult super-hero flick that holds nothing back. Throughout the film you will hear multiple superhero references from Spiderman to Batman but this is anything but. Bullets are flying, cursing everywhere, blood splattering and plenty of morbid laughter. It was fun. Very adult, ridiculous, over the top but insanely fun.<br/><br/>They could not have cast the main character better. Aaron Taylor-Johnson is the perfect mis-understood ""nerd"" who wants to be something more. He is very stereotypical but then that is the whole point of his character. He feels like the everyday Joe and yet becomes something so much more. He does this great physical comedy where you believe what he is trying to do but still laugh at his mistakes. Lyndsy Fonseca is the object of his affections. She's the popular girl and wants her to be his ""Mary Jane"" so to speak. She does an alright job, nothing stand out but certainly serves her purpose and is absolutely a hot girl so it works. Christopher Mintz-Plasse is known for his comedy. He has had some really campy roles but he is very likable. He is used mostly sparingly in this, which I think is good because he might have just been a tad too much for a movie like this which is trying to be subtly funny and sarcastic. Mark Strong is excellent as the evil Frank D'Amico. Strong always makes a great villain and he fits this film very well. And what a terrific and iconic ending to his villainous role. Nicholas Cage has a small but vital role to the story. He is actually quite good in the part and takes a back seat to the other characters. I sort of saved the best for last in my books. Chloe Grace Moretz who has become something of an ""It"" girl in Hollywood as of late is terrific in her breakthrough role as ""Hit-Girl"" Her foul mouthed violent superhero is fun, disturbing and just almost too far and yet fits in so well with the film. She proves even then her star power and easily steals every scene. I wanted to see more interaction with her and Taylor-Johnson which perhaps we will get in the sequel.<br/><br/>Matthew Vaughan has chosen his projects carefully and it has paid off because everything I have seen of his has been excellent. He seems to know how to handle action scenes but tell a great story and get the very most out of his characters. I would hazard a guess that he is a die-hard geek because he presents his super-heroes like real people in a real world that happens to be so over the top. Kick-Ass is such a unique blend of spoof and action and comedy and adult entertainment. Everything from the music montages, the cheeky and campy costumes and the insane action. This is well worth watching and very entertaining. Glad I finally saw it and looking forward to the sequel!! 8.5/10"
"dallasryan","9","3","4","21 November 2012"," Right on the Money
","This movie really did hit it right on the money. It's what Kill Bill wishes it was. If Tarantino would have understood his material, he could have made great movies out of Kill Bill like Kick-Ass, but Tarantino didn't understand the material, therefore you get Operation Dog Dung with the Kill Bill Movies. But Kick-Ass has a story, it has characters you like and that you care about to where everything flows together in the right direction. <br/><br/>Kick-Ass has the perfect amount of kid action and grown up action to where Spiderman had the right amount of kid action but not enough grown up action and Watchmen(which was brilliant as well) didn't quite have the right tone for the younger viewers, which is actually fine with me though because I love Watchmen. <br/><br/>But if we're talking about the perfect movie in this genre, then Kick- Ass is almost that movie. The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises take the award for best movies in this genre, in my opinion, but Kick-Ass is definitely in the Top 5. <br/><br/>Warren Beatty's Dick Tracy had The Citizen Kane quality camera work going for it, and it had confusion in that classic comic book sense but it still lacked in story and was a little bit too much at times, but Kick-Ass has just the right amount of ingredients for not having too much or too less, it's just right. <br/><br/>Chloe Grace Moretz' Hit-Girl makes Saoirse Ronan's Hanna look like a sissy. Hanna could have been a good movie, but it didn't have the writing or the budget, but Saoirse was pretty good in Hanna though nonetheless. But Chloe Grace Moretz owned her part in Kick-Ass as Hit- Girl, and no one can touch her in the girl you don't mess with category. <br/><br/>Also, I was very impressed with Nicolas Cage in Kick-Ass as well. He hasn't had great part for a long time, for a very long time and his quirky acting and tone was absolutely perfect for his role as Big Daddy in Kick-Ass. Cage is terrific! <br/><br/>Kick-Ass is the movie everyone should see. It utilizes everything in the best possible way, from the use of the internet to all of it's characters, and it truly makes you care about all of them until the very end. A must see."
"mat-mcnaughton-254-33257","9","3","4","6 October 2012"," Kick-Ass is a bad ass.
","This movie is all sorts of ludicrous, and I love that. I could've sword that Aaron Taylor-Johnson was Ian from ""Sex Drive"", but he wasn't. (Clark Duke is in both, however.) Nic Cage is teaching his ten-year-old daughter to be a killer, and she ends up murdering like, 100 guys throughout the movie. Taylor-Johnson pretends to be gay in order to be close to a girl he likes, and she doesn't freak out when he tells her the truth. Mark Strong kills a guy for watching him kill another guy. If you can get past the violence, you'll see that this movie is amazing. It's everything you'd want in a true-to-life superhero movie. (It's basically the opposite of ""Chronicle"" with killing skills, not superpowers.) The comic book stylings were also a nice touch. I very much recommend it to anybody who likes a good deathfest.<br/><br/>(EDIT: Oh yeah, he had a Myspace. Terrible.)"
"Mr-Fusion","7","3","4","6 August 2012"," It's funny, it's violent, and actually a breath of fresh air among all of the trite genre movies.
","""Why hasn't anyone become a superhero?""<br/><br/>That question is at the heart of Matthew Vaughn's ""Kick-Ass"", a deconstructionist superhero movie that sees awkward teenager Dave (Aaron Johnson) actually don the spandex and venture out onto the rooftops ... who then proceeds to promptly gets his ass kicked on more than one occasion. <br/><br/>But the question gets away from Vaughn, as the movie introduces a larger narrative and centers on a violent pre-teen girl (Chloe Moretz) who, as the sidekick to the Batman-esque Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage), eschews a normal childhood in favor of ACTUALLY kicking ass. <br/><br/>For the most part, it's a fun ride. Cage gleefully chews the scenery in his gun-wielding Batman ripoff role (complete with Adam West dialogue impersonation). ""Kick-Ass"" features more bloody fight scenes than you can shake a stick at, with Moretz doing most of the anatomical damage. And unless you're Roger Ebert, there's some deliciously twisted humor to be found in those ass-kickings. And Mark Strong shines as the big bad guy crime boss (unexpectedly hilarious). <br/><br/>There are moments of adolescent angst, the ""hero"" actually does get the girl (not really a spoiler, here) and the words, ""With no power comes no responsibility"" are actually uttered. What better time for this movie's release than at the height (I hope) of Hollywood's superhero fetish. <br/><br/>7/10"
"freddycrooger1998","9","3","4","27 July 2012"," A Catastrophically Great Comic Transformation
","I want to start out by saying that Kick-Ass is my number one film of all time. It's got a mixture of, pretty much everything that i love in a movie - lots of bloody action, dark comedy blended in, a slight tinge of romance, and a large dose of awesomeness. <br/><br/>We have a great young actor, Aaron Johnson, (Angus Thongs and Perfect Snogging), Christopher Mintz-Plasse, (Superbad), Chloe Moretz, (Let Me In, Dark Shadows), Nicholas Cage, (The Wicker Man, Knowing), and many other great actors.<br/><br/>It's the story of Dave Lizewski, played by Aaron Johnson, who has a dead mother, and two average guys. He describes himself as not the popular, not the funny, not the geeky, just a normal high-schooler. Him and his friends, played by Clark Duke and Evan Peters, are sitting in a comic book shop one day, pondering why no-one has ever become a superhero before.<br/><br/>Walking back from the store, Dave and his friend encounter two muggers, who steal their comic books and money. <br/><br/>When Dave gets back home, he orders a swimsuit. This is what is to become, the Kick-Ass costume. The day he gets it, he tries it on, and he has these sort of, stick/baton things that he can use as a form of attack.<br/><br/>After school, he sees the two muggers again on his way home; they are trying to break into a car. They ask him, 'The f*** you looking' at!"".<br/><br/>Dave runs back around the corner, and in classic parody of most superheroes, rips off his shirt to reveal the costume. He goes back around to the muggers, and begins to attack. All seems to be going quite balanced, almost 60/40 to Dave, when suddenly one of the muggers stabs him. They realize that he's been stabbed, and flee from the scene.<br/><br/>As Dave tries to leave the area, in obvious agonizing pain, he is doubled over, almost crawling, if you'd like. He is UN-aware that he has crossed into the middle of a road, and a car comes speeding, running him over.<br/><br/>I'll only give tell you that, because if you haven't watched this film yet, then you seriously need to. Nicholas Cage definitely plays the protective father role very well, but the fact that he has brought his daughter into the world of violence is very different to any other father role you may have seen before. The first scene you see of Hit Girl and Big Daddy out of costume is, to say the least, quite comical.<br/><br/>Anyone who was a fan of superhero movies, like spider-man, (Because this is a very spider-man-Esq movie) will definitely enjoy this. Miss it and you'll regret it for the rest of your life. Trust me."
"dromasca","7","3","4","8 July 2012"," wild ride
","The heroes in 'Kick-Ass' are not made of special forms of matter and are not un-breakable. They try however to live to the ambitions of the super-heroes myth in a world which seems to believe in myths, and take the superhero life-style paths. Of course, when regular people act as super-heroes they can also get hurt, especially as they are at different levels of evolution in their training. A dad and his 11 years daughter seem to be the most advanced, with a high-school teenager who is actually the main hero following them bravely on the same path. Another teenager rather seems to be on the dark side, but he also tries the funny costumes and the weapons of the trade. The names of the heroes are Big Daddy, Hit Girl, Kick-Ass which seem like warnings not to take things too much seriously. There are some background explanations, but these do not count too much. The general tone of the film is on the comic register, a combination of superheroes parody and teenager growing pains comedy but the mix becomes lethal when it comes to action scenes. These are actually as violent as you can get in a Tarantino movie, and the scenes featuring the father training his 11 years daughter to become a killing machine (even if for the good cause of justice) risk to upset anybody who stops for a second to reflect at what is presented on the screen, and takes the subject too seriously and out of the nonsense territory.<br/><br/>The film does also belong to another genre - the 'how could Nicholas Cage pick such a role?' one. With all due respect for the film, which is actually a well made, well paced and entertaining movie if you can overcome or you do not care about the moral aspects, Cage's presence in a supporting role in which he walks most of the time with a ridiculous thick make-up is wasted time for his enormous talent. That's certainly just a (big) fan opinion. Otherwise you can accept the convention and just enjoy the wild ride."

","With no powers comes no responsibility..except that's not always true....<br/><br/>What more I can say about this movie!I'm completely blown away by this very different action /adventure/teen/romance/spoof movie.Seriously it's very hard to describe kick ass's genre.In starting it looks like a spoof cum teen superhero comedy like any other teen movie but as the movie goes up it shows it's potential.Director Mathew Vaughn gives Dave(Kickass) a unique characterization.He is normal geek,Wanna be cool guy who has a wicked friend group,He fantasizes about teacher yet loves a girl desperately.completely unnoticed by girls and being tired of his boring normal life he wishes that even abnormality is better than his daily average life.This pathos even has been portrayed so comically that it has many laugh out loud scenes.<br/><br/>But movie transforms into bloody,gory kill bill type genre as soon as he decides to be a vigilante.Though his initial days were not good,soon he got attention and becomes phenomenon.He teams up with a bunch of much more trained assassin cum superhero big daddy and hit girl who are determined to bring down mobster Frank.But the road is not easy.Kickass soon feels the heat to be an untrained, non gifted superhero.Will he continue? Can he finish his mission? can he get his love? is this possible to be a simple normal guy yet a vigilante cum superhero? Director Mathew brought Japanese style comic action with Tarrantino style bloody revenge drama mixed in a teen movie.You have not seen any thing like this in your entire life. He never becomes larger than life,yet it is so inspiring movie .much more than even spider man.You have to wonder how basically a sex cum teen movie has so many good shades that includes Breathtaking action( specially the when kick ass fights with 3 mobs at a while and climax where hit girl and kick ass attacks whole mob gang like matrix),Powerful dialogs, beautiful cinematography, awesome songs( specially theme song and the score when hit girl attacks wearing a night vision), amazing special effects and yes.awesome acting from a bunch of youngsters like Aaron,Chloe.The real show stealer is hit girl .no doubt! The best thing about this movie is it's so much non serious yet it has a heart and for god's sake.it's not a spoof.It is one of the best superhero movie ever made(counting the dark knight)...mark my word.<br/><br/>I wish Indian audience could see this thrilling ride named KICKASS.But it didn't release here.Kickass has been unnoticed by not only in India but also outside. But in future it will be called as cult action-teen movie which failed to draw attention at that time."

The characters were well matched up with the actors, and the costumes were phenomenal for the roles of heroes, a old Joe trying to save the world. Aaron Taylor Johnson had a role that with the movie it would evolved into something bigger and he did a great jobs demonstrating it, and Hit girl or Chloe Grace Moretz really kicked some ass.

"MechaWingZero","9","4","6","13 February 2012"," Almost perfect, but gets a little carried away at parts.
","(only very spoilers, I'm only marking this review to be absolutely safe) I totally enjoyed this movie. Granted, being a 19-year-old male who likes comic books and has trouble getting a girlfriend (I've never had one before), I am the perfect demographic. I've always thought how cool it would be to be a superhero too! There are a lot of positives about this movie. For one thing, it is action-packed, exciting and funny, and for another the characters actually have depth to them. It's nice to see a combination like this. It keeps you very interested in what will happen next, and does a great job at not dragging (dragging on with boring parts is my #1 pet peeve in movies). I will avoid going into specifics so that this review can be as spoiler free as possible, but I will say that it has a warmhearted feel that is different from the comic book it is based on. <br/><br/>On the negative side, there are a few things inserted that I feel are very unnecessary. Like for instance, that we have to go into how our main character Dave jacks off to pictures of tribal women from Africa. I mean, come on, I of all people can sympathize with a character being sexually frustrated, but that detail is just totally unneeded. Things of this nature are put here and there all throughout the movie. Fortunately, they are brief and/or minor enough to look past.<br/><br/>This is not a movie for the easily offended. It is extremely violent, has a good deal of sexuality (though not in a pornographic way) and has some controversial content involving a child. If your twelve-year-old son wants to see this movie (for which I don't blame him, I would have too), you probably shouldn't let him. Regardless, it does have a good heart, and sort of a wholesome message. I have sometimes struggled with whether or not it is morally okay for me to love this movie, but the truth is, I do."

","Interesting to say the least! If only Tarantino had gotten his little creative paws on this before Matthew Vaughn did we would have really seen some kicking ass....Needless to say I thought it dragged a bit and was going to be beyond ridiculous but like Shoot Em Up did it eventually grew on me and then some. I will say this and that Chloe Moretz has a dirty little mouth for her age lol but Hit Girl should've been the main feature in this graphic comic book adaptation. I loved the dynamic duo of her and her dad (nic cage) in this. It was also a cool original storyline which if anyone has the same tastes as me in film will love this. Loads and loads of guns and violence mixed up in a bowl always adds for pure enjoyment on my part."
"Barons23","9","21","50","10 March 2010"," Enjoyable Surprise
","I had only seen one trailer before actually seeing Kick-Ass in its entirety. The unknown in this situation turned out to be the greatest asset in enjoying this film. The movie starts off a little slow, where I actually found myself getting a little bored during the base character development. Eventually I was able to relate to the characters and become attached to the story line. Somewhere after the first third of the film it begins to change its momentum. It began like an indie film and finished like another installment in the Spiderman series. I think the greatest appeal of this movie would be to not over advertise and numb a very good film. I was lucky enough to see this movie without any biases or judgments and the result was fantastic. I left the theater looking forward to a sequel with only a few questions on the ending of the movie, loose ends have always had a tendency to frustrate me. In order to enjoy this film I would recommend seeing it as soon as you can before any negative opinions can shadow an enjoyable movie."

Besides, I want to ask the film's writers and directors that what were they thinking when they were making an 11 year old child do all those gruesome acts in spite of realizing the fact that the movie would be rated R and children would not be able to see it. <br/><br/>3) Sound: Actually the sound effects of this film were the only high point of this film and this was the fact why I tolerated this film. <br/><br/>4) Violence: I am dead against such acts of violence committed by a child of 11 years of age.I even shudder at the mere fact that what these violent scenes must had an impact on the simple mind of an 11 year old and what bad effect these abuses might have in a later life.I fail to fathom the plight of this child. <br/><br/>P.S. :- I was taken away by all the high Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb ratings and decided to see this movie.

","""Kick-Ass"" is a comedy about superheroes. Dave Lizewski lives in New York. He is a huge comic book fan, who is unnoticed at school and lives alone with his father. One day he makes a decision to become a superhero, without any training or super powers. He tries to ""save"" people who look like they are in trouble, but ends up failing each time. In one of his superhero attempts, Dave successfully helps a man who is being hunted by 3 men in front of a cafeteria. The teenagers watching the fight record the fight and upload the footage to the internet. This is when Dave proclaims his self as ""Kick Ass"". Frank D'Amico, a gang leader, believes that ""Kick Ass"" is responsible for the actions against his gang members. As he is being hunted, he meets up with 2 real superheroes, ""Hit Girl"" and ""Big Daddy"".<br/><br/>The director, Matthew Vaughn, successfully shows how superheroes come into existence. The film is a fantastic mix of action and comedy. Each individual character is created very thoroughly, and the viewer can see deeply into each character.<br/><br/>""Hit Girl"" (also known as Mindy Macready) is a 12 year old super hero played by Chloe Grace Moretz. Her performances with Nicolas Cage (Damon Macready/Big Daddy) were great. She by far gives the best presentation. Although all the actors were great playing their roles, Moretz is my number 1 favourite actress, And to be honest, if she wasn't in it, I may have not watched the movie. This is probably one of her best films to date. 10/10 for her acting, looks, and presentation. Another good thing is that she would never swear in real life. Personal Quote: ""As Chloe, I can honestly say I've never uttered a syllable of a curse word, not even behind closed doors."" - Chloe Grace Moretz<br/><br/>I recommend this film to anyone with a like for comedy or action. The film will have a way to satisfy everyone.<br/><br/>9/10 - best film of the year!"
"MartinHafer","7","7","13","5 August 2010"," A laundry list of things your parents DON'T want you to do...
","""Kick-Ass"" is a film that looks as if the film makers wanted to put everything into a film that parents would be horrified to have their kids see or do...and then they marketed it directly to these kids. Socially irresponsible? Sure...but also quite entertaining. Here is a brief listing of the things horrified parents will see in the film: profuse use of the f-word, lots of intense violence, super-heroes who brutally kill their prey, masturbatory references, brutality that surprised me, teens having hot and sweaty sex, severed limbs, etc.--all things kids are clearly told NOT to do and not to see. Yet much of the time, it IS being done by kids who are teens or even younger. Seeing an 11 year-old using such strong language and eviscerating villains with reckless abandon IS something you don't see every day! <br/><br/>While I could analyze the movie or describe its plot, I won't, as there are 16 bazillion reviews for this film already. Instead, I want to direct this review to parents. While kids really DO talk the way they do in this movie (as a high school teacher, I know) and the film makers captured this well, even if you ignore the hard-core language I don't think you should let younger viewers see this film. My 20 year-old watched it and loved it, but I didn't let my soon to be 16 year-old--she is just not as mature as some kids her age. The violence is just something I think too many teens already are too comfortable with--and this film will only make this worse. Now if you have an older teen, then I say let them see it--or, the fact is, they might be old enough that it really doesn't matter what you say. Just be fore-warned--this is NOT a kids movie or even one for the average teen--it's just too full of stuff they are probably not mature enough to handle. Heck, I'm not even sure if I am!<br/><br/>Coincidentally, last night I saw a Japanese film that was HIGHLY reminiscent of ""Kick-Ass"". ""Lady Snowblood"" is a tale of revenge concerning a baby who is raised to exact revenge for her parents--one of the same themes in ""Kick-Ass""--and the film is about equally violent and bloody. If you liked ""Kick-Ass"", then give this other film a look--it turned out to be Taratino's inspiration for the ""Kill Bill"" series."

Someone wrote on IMDb ""This movie is laugh out loud where I missed things and have to go back and see it again"". I did not laugh one single time in this film. I was starting to wonder if I just didn't get the movie, but after 40 minutes I noticed that no one else in the theater was laughing either. I guess no one got it. As I left the theater, I was behind a couple and the man said ""this was a a waste of time."" I have to agree with that statement.<br/><br/>I thought about it and I believe that this movie is as dull, uninspired, unimaginative and as boring as Napolean Dynamite. I think if you are a fan of Napolean Dynamite then you would enjoy this film. For those of us who are older, I do not see you liking this movie. The acting is so bland that it reminds you of the times when Saturday Night Live tried to take a 30 second skit and make a full length movie out of it. The movie is advertised as a Superhero wannabe--it isn't. This movie is about vigilante justice--it is mass murder by the ""good guys"" on an extreme level. The one good point of the film can also be considered a great example of a kind of child abuse. The 10 year old character is the best part of the movie, yet the director decided that she should continually spout the F-bomb and the big C. Was that necessary? No--it had no impact on the film whatsoever.<br/><br/>I would not recommend this movie, but that is why we all have different tastes--because I know others enjoyed it a lot."
"Quinoa1984","6","13","29","15 April 2010"," ""Wait till they get a load of me"" Ho-Ho
","I can't claim to be an aficionado of the comic-book Kick-Ass, written by Mark Millar and John Romita (and in case you don't remember, don't worry, their names pop up as characters read the comic-book on screen, good tie in, I mean, in-joke), and I can't even speak entirely for what the man's talents as a writer are completely (other exposure would include his Superman: Red Son comic, which was a fantastic 'elseworld' book, and the adaptation of Wanted from 2008, which was... decent). But what is here is the film, directed by Matthew Vaughn, on a rather gigantic wave of fan-boy buzz and hype. Character posters have appeared in subway stations and on internet sites, commercial emphasize the ""Kick-Ass""-ed nature of the characters, and the trailer is juiced up to pump up the audience like there's no tomorrow. As a red-blooded 20-something going into the film, I had no expectations as to the total quality of the film, but I hoped for the best.<br/><br/>As it turns out, Kick-Ass is... just OK. That might be the worst thing Vaughn would want to hear, but it's what happens when one shoots so high with a high concept while also, as a director, not taking into account something as, say, originality. I don't mean in the premise itself, per-say, which concerns a teenage kid, Dave, who is just an average nerdy dude who gets picked on and whose mother died rather un-tragically from an aneurysm (oh, and he masturbates a lot, just thought I'd share that). He decides one day, 'hey, why doesn't someone just become a superhero?' Dave throws on a scuba suit, goes out into the world, and... gets his ass beaten down, a lot, like emergency-room suitable. But, as he says, like a good serial killer, he can't let go, and keeps going out, getting his ass kicked (and kicking a little bit here and there), and a video sparks him into the momentary flavor of the moment.<br/><br/>There is some satire present here in this concept, and with some of the other characters, like Mr. McCready and his daughter, Mindy, the former training the latter since birth to fight and, on occasion, be shot at like it's going to the park (""It's like getting punched in the chest,"" kindly Damon says). Whether this is all really top-notch satire it's hard to say; from the looks of material in Kick-Ass and Millar's previous adaptation Wanted it's easy to say that he's a big Fight Club flavor, really, just a big comics fan since naturally he writes for them and wants to toy and see what makes the conventions kick. In fact I wasn't bothered so much by the Big Daddy/Hit Girl relationship... actually, that's a white lie. It is disturbing, particularly when set, at least at first, in something that really resembles a ""real"" world in the scope of a movie. But it's handled well in the sense that it's interesting.<br/><br/>I actually would want to see more of that, and see more of Hit Girl/Mindy developed. But then again, why have development (playing Devil's Advocate here) when you can just have Hit Girl by way of her father/mentor go around killing lots of people without much background in character. What ultimately comes up in the film is a sense of a shallow interpretation of the material, of it sliding into a weird region where it loses sense of any kind of reality based in its satire and becomes a derivative fan-boy genre wet dream. And I'm not trying to make hyperbole with that; Vaughn transforms his film, in the second half, after what has been a curious mixed-up but sometimes very funny story of misguided outcasts living vicariously through fantasy, into a genre knock-off. And not even that, but a Tarantino knock-off. By the time the Morricone music came up and the masses of guards arrived, only one thought creeped in my mind: At what point does Hit Girl join the Deadly Vipers? <br/><br/>The loss of originality in the direction, and moments of humor that fall flat, could be made up by the performances. As luck would have it, Nicolas Cage does really rise up to the occasion (perhaps as he's such a comic-book fan himself that he really does get what Millar and Romita went for). He puts on a strange William Shatner type of inflection for stretches of time, and puts some serious emphasis into his characters own vendetta - his story makes up the crux of the film, getting vengeance at the gangster played by Mark Strong - and he gives a genuine piece of work, at times howlingly hysterical and dead-pan. Those who fare less well are Hit Girl, played by Chloe Moretz (though she does what she can), and especially the guy playing Kick-Ass. Even in scenes where I wanted to get behind the jokes, like the running side-story with Dave and the girl who thinks he's gay (a creep thing to do, but hey, he's a teen), I couldn't because it's just an unconvincing performance. Mint-Plasse as Red Mist doesn't fare much better, but the character is one-note anyway.<br/><br/>I wish I could get behind the film a lot more than I did. Yet, the longer it lingers in my mind after watching it, the less I think of it, favorably or negatively really. It will probably give its already solidified fans of the comic something to chew on, and maybe Vaughn can bring a few more into his cinematic fold. Little sparks of a fantastic commentary show up (perhaps media attention, which has some basis in fact, re: the story a year ago in Cincinatti where an actual guy named ""Shadow Hare"" went out to try and fight crime, could have given some better focus). But overall, it doesn't really make its mark as its own genuine article, which is a shame."

"Coolphill","10","6","11","3 December 2010"," Film of 2010. Defineltly. Best Film ever? I think so!
","This year saw the release of a fair amount of comic book movies hitting the big screen. Iron man 2, the losers, Scott pilgrim vs the world, it was easy to dismiss Kick Ass when caught up in all the hype of the other big screen superhero films that were to surface in 2010. And yet Kick ass beats them all. I went in to see kick ass with low expectations. The trailer seemed average and the overall marketing campaign didn't seem to be advertising a brilliant film. However I was swayed into giving it a chance due to the incredible reviews. And boy am I glad I was. The film powers along at a perfect pace, the characters are fun and likable and also have more depth then they first appear to have. The script is smart original and innovative, Mathew Vaughn and Jane Goldman's script is one of the best in film history, it has a perfect blend of humour, character development, action, and touching emotional moments and is genuinely different. The acting is incredible with Aaron Johnson (who has a convincing American accent), Nichloas Cage and Mark Strong all giving outstanding performances. But the real star of the show is Chloe Moretz as 11 year old assassin/superhero Hit Girl. Whatever scene she is in she steals, be it an incredible action sequence (like the warehouse, strobe light scene one of the greatest action scenes ever filmed)or sharing an intimate close moment with her father.She plays the character with real depth and heart and is also really really cool. Hit girl could become one of this generations movie icons. Especially when you consider the amount of publicity her character and Moretz's performance have received. She truly is one to watch. Combine this with some ultra violence,nerdy comic book and film references,characters I actually care about and a genuinely feel good ending and in my opinion you have a perfect piece of entertainment. But what makes it a great film rather than a great fun but forgettable experience is a near (spoiler alert) heartbreaking moment about 1 hour 25 minutes into the film. This injection of emotionality into the film pushes it from film of the year to one of the best (in my opinion The best) films ever. Never before have I watched a film over and over again as much as Kick ass. No other film can put such a big smile on my face after watching it, I truly cannot recommend this film to everyone any more."
"sme_no_densetsu","8","6","11","20 October 2010"," One of the better superhero movies out there
","""Kick-Ass"" asks the question, ""What would happen if an ordinary guy decided to become a superhero?"" The answer is that he becomes a cultural phenomenon even though he basically sucks at crime-fighting. However, before long he crosses the path of a father and daughter team who really know what they're doing. Pretty soon he's in way over his head and has the local crime boss out to get him.<br/><br/>The story is an interesting one even though it doesn't really live up to its potential. The title character is the least interesting character in the movie. Given that fact, it's probably a good thing that the more conventional superheroes Hit-Girl and Big Daddy show up. Of course, their introduction makes the story more akin to the usual superhero fare. Where this film really separates itself from the pack is in the R-rated violence, not the slightly-more-realistic-than-usual setup.<br/><br/>The acting is in pretty good hands, at least for a superhero movie. Aaron Johnson is fairly unremarkable as the title character but, luckily, the show is stolen by pre-teen Chloe Moretz, who plays Hit-Girl. Nic Cage also gives an interesting performance as Big Daddy, Hit-Girl's father. Few others really stand out, mainly because most of the characters are clichéd and/or one-dimensional.<br/><br/>The directorial style of Matthew Vaughan is energetic and well suited to the comic book material. The special effects are pretty decent as well though they're nothing to write home about. The soundtrack is pretty hip, too, but to me it seemed a bit overbearing.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Kick-Ass"" is among the best superhero movies I've seen but it certainly isn't without its faults. The grit of the film goes a long way in covering up its shortcomings, though, and the character of Hit-Girl is destined for cult status. Some may find the action too violent but I think it only seems excessively violent in comparison with the usual PG-13 superhero fare."
"aeon_static","7","6","11","11 August 2010"," Good - not great.
","Seeing how the audience's standards seem to have lowered over the past decade, I generally expect a movie heralded as ""great"" to be decent, but almost never great.<br/><br/>That's where Kick-Ass lies in my book. I enjoyed the ride, and as an incredibly picky viewer, that says something. The film is, however, far from perfect - which is forgivable. There were a number of things, however, that could've been avoided or addressed, that would've helped the film to be truly great.<br/><br/>First, and most notably, is the film's outright identity crisis in theme. In a normal superhero or awesome vigilante tale, we expect a great amount of suspension of disbelief. Lots of things are going to happen that are totally unrealistic. That's fine. We expect that. Then, what amount of realism can be injected into the tale is a sort of treat - it helps with the immersion and seems to give the outlandish stuff some credibility... At least, enough to keep you involved.<br/><br/>With Kick-Ass, however, it was the complete opposite. The first act of the movie stresses the idea that ""this story is grounded in a realistic world"". That's fine. But then, later, when the outlandish stuff goes on... It's cool, and I can enjoy it, but it ripped me out of the world I thought I had just been introduced to. Only now do we understand that this is more of a mish-mash of themes - that it's actually not much different at heart from other superhero tales. That's fine. But what gives? You got me to LIKE the ""realistic"" side of things. You got me invested in it. Did you really think you couldn't stick to that for the entire movie, still follow the same plot, and not have it walk away victorious? Sigh.<br/><br/>The music has the same problems. One second we're immersed under hypnotically epic tracks from the films ""28 Days Later"" and ""Sunshine"" - - then it turns around and prods a pop-rock track at us akin to a normal ""edgy teen flick"".<br/><br/>In short, I found myself not knowing what to feel at a given moment, because I was too busy wondering how I should feel about the previous 20 minutes. Speaking of running time, with the amount of scenes that were drawn out for dramatic effect (only to be resolved in a minute or two by grandiose action), they could've developed one more superhero and had him/her die in a gritty, realistic manner. Would've helped.<br/><br/>Worst of all was the final reveal of the ""secret weapon"", which, even though it exists in the real world, was seriously off the mark. I won't spoil anything, but if the ""secret weapon"" had been revealed to be a tricked-out grenade launcher, a single mini-gun, one of those armed robot rover things... Anything along those ends would've sufficed. What it actually turned out to be was just too much.<br/><br/>All in all, I still found my attention fixed on the film, and I did find myself ""digging it"". The effort was noble. The result was well-done. For a little get-away into a movie on a Friday night, I supposed you couldn't ask for more.<br/><br/>Kick-Ass kicks ass, but I'll have to stick with The Dark Knight as the best modern superhero flick ... for now. 7/10"
"kool-knight85","8","12","27","31 March 2010"," Kick-Ass, another comic book film, is it as good as the comic?
","Yes we have another comic book film, but its OK people, this is one of those collaborations that work well.<br/><br/>Now right off the bat, this is a good film, a very good film. It's entertaining, funny and bloody. It also has an acceptable story line. I won't bother explaining what the story is, because in all fairness you should know. This isn't exactly 'se7en' or 'the usual suspects' we're talking about, it's Kick-Ass. There's no unbelievable or unforeseen twist. To be frank, if you've read the graphic novel (that's a comic to anyone who's not a fan) you will already know it's very funny and very, very bloody, the film delivers these two qualities perfectly. The fights are one of the greatest parts of the whole graphic novel, and in the film they're well directed and shot marvellously, you get all the death and gore upfront, in your face, the way we like it. When someone dies in Kick-Ass, you know there dead. Hit Girl also really manages to rack up a huge body count; it could very well rival The Bride's, crazy 88 massacre, from 'kill bill vol. 1'. In fact, that would be a great movie on it's own, just the two of them in a room with some swords. And, (unlike the comic) Big Daddy gets his own kick ass fighting scene, which is undeniably, incredibly awesome. <br/><br/>As for the adaption of the story, it's OK. Let's be honest though, if the film had followed the comic's plot completely to the letter, it would be a four hour epic, no one would have watched it like that. But likewise, it could have been another 'watchmen' and have the life edited out of it. Luckily the edited adaption here did the graphic novel justice and offered a much greater role for Hit Girl and Big Daddy. Whose parts are significantly changed, and anyone who's read the graphic novel will pick up on this. Also, Mark Strong's character 'Frank D'Amico' is expanded and more involved in the story, unlike in the comic. This is a nice touch to the film as a whole and works.<br/><br/>However this film isn't without its flaws, to name one. Red Mist, he is this films Anti-Christ. And I really do like this film. But he's the biggest problem with it. Now the costume redesigns worked for Kick-Ass, Hit Girl and Big Daddy, they worked really well, but Red Mists costume is terrible! (and he kills the ending of the whole film, I pray when they release this to DVD the last 8 seconds are cut out, he shots the camera... No really I'm not joking, he's dressed like a transvestite, delivers some crappy line to the camera and then shoots it!?) Christopher Mintz-Plasse plays Red Mist but sadly he doesn't suit the part, he was great as McLovin, and we all loved him as McLovin, but McLovin isn't Red Mist, I actually don't think he can distinguish the two characters. Also, in the film you know he's the villain from the very beginning, unlike in the comic. In the comic the fact he is a villain is a very well played twist. But here it's not. Truthfully I don't think anyone knows what Red Mist is intended to do in this story. For example, when he meets Hit Girl and Big Daddy, for no reason, he whips out a pistol and blows Hit Girl away. Now at this part of the films he doesn't even know who Hit Girl is. But he still whips out a gun and shoots her; he shoots a kid, he doesn't know, several times, for seemingly no reason. Then when his gang come in to capture Kick-Ass and (the grieving) Big Daddy he tells them to lets Kick-Ass go... In the context of the scene this is very out of place. It would have worked much better if they'd kept Red Mist like he was in the comic... and perhaps got a different actor, Mintz-Plasse is a good actor, but he didn't suit this part. The rest of my complaints with the film are just small thing, why was there a jet pack? I mean there was no need for it. Why did Kick-Ass have no scars? He has surgery all over his body, yet when he's topless he has no scars.<br/><br/>Also, I should mention Nicolas Cage. He isn't my favourite actor, he has done some great films and lots of crap ones, but it must be said, in Kick-Ass, Nicolas Cag is an amazing Big Daddy, he does this part so extraordinarily well. You believe he is a father who he loves and cares for his daughter, and yet, you know he is a cruel man, who murders and tortures many people in his relentless pursuit for justice. In addition, Chloë Grace Moretz must be credited as a magnificent Hit Girl, she kick's more ass than Kick-Ass, and does it so well, you enjoy watching her fight off twenty bad guys, she has no fear, that could be to do with her father shooting her at the beginning. But anyway, to the viewer she seems invincible.<br/><br/>So in conclusion; the amazing adaption of Big Daddy and Hit Girl more than makes up for the sheer travesty of Red Mist's adaption. Aaron Johnson (Kick-Ass) is brilliant; he acts his part excellently, as does Mark Strong. Kick-Ass is an amazing film, not in the same way 'the dark knight' was, but it still raises the bar for the next comic book films. This is more than differently worth seeing and the graphic novel is worth checking out to! See it NOW, and if you've seen it, see it AGAIN!"
"Bioweapon","1","9","19","29 May 2011"," A mediocre movie with an identity crisis
","Kick Ass is nothing but a mediocre film.<br/><br/>It is not an awful movie, neither it's outstanding. Let's see: <br/><br/>(1) The plot: a guys sees how the city is ruled by bad people and thinks ""it would be awesome that someone stood up and fought them... an average joe that decided to face them"". Our main character does that role. Not outstanding, bot awful. Just mediocre.<br/><br/>(2) Performances: all the main actors fit their roles, all of them deliver. Though they are not outstanding, neither awful. They are just mediocre.<br/><br/>(3) Camera arrangements: they are not excellent, neither bad. Simply mediocre.<br/><br/>So, we have a movie that is simply mediocre.<br/><br/>Now, why does it have an identity crisis? - Because the movie has some fun moments, but they are not fun enough to make you roll over the floor laughing.<br/><br/><ul><li>Because the movie has some action scenes, but they are mild. I mean you see blood (let me talk about that later), but there is no climax. You see some bullets fly, some kills, but no intensity.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Because the movie has some gory situations, but not enough to call it a gore movie. I mean, you see some blood splats, but nothing else. No intensity.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Because it tries to be a teenager movie (they typical class loser that wants to get the nice girl and can't), but it does not have the plot elements. No tension created. Suddenly from one moment to the other, the guy snaps his finger and gets the girl.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Because there are no decent criminals. I mean, criminals are laughable, but not laughable enough for a comedy. They are wannabe bad-guys, but they are too serious too be in a comedy and too silly to be in a crime movie.</li></ul><br/><br/>For all these reasons, you finish watching the movie and you ask yourself: is this supposed to be a comedy, an action movie or what? Like in any mediocre film, when you end seeing it, you feel that you spent 90 minutes watching a movie that was like ""meh.... okay. Ummmm... got to take out the garbage. Yeah."". You don't complain saying it was a waste of time, but you neither say ""hell yeah.... this was good movie"".<br/><br/>So, in the end, Kickass is condemned to fall into oblivion."
"racinGSRstyle","1","10","22","4 July 2010"," Really good? Yes. Top 250? NO.
","7.9/10 Kick-Ass is a really good movie, don't get me wrong. But it's fatal flaw, if you can call it that, is the ending. By the time the 3rd(?) big fight rolls around, you're past the best part of the movie and moving into post-The Matrix slow motion acrobatics meets gun fighting meets karate we've all seen several times before. All of the story has come to pass and all that is left is ridiculous and very comic book-like violence. This is not a bad thing, and the movie IS based on a comic book after all, but I really felt like the movie was SO good up until that point that the rest was just more of the same action we'd already experienced throughout the film while being bereft of anything compelling or new, and was something of a let down.<br/><br/>This is definitely a great movie overall. If the final I dunno 20-30 minutes or whatever had been better this would deserve the place it currently holds in the top 250. As it stands this is a movie that pretty much everyone should see, and you could do A LOT worse."

","OK I have been called out on this before but here me out. I didn't say it was the best movie ever. I said it was my favorite. I love movies like Fight club, the matrix, the god father, scarface, pulp fiction, shawshank redemption etc... And they are all masterpieces of cinematography. But Kick-ass is my favorite. Its funny, exciting, intense, and at time's emotional. It has a brilliant script which is brilliantly acted. Of course the movie belongs to Hit Girl,portrayed by the beautiful Chloe Grace Moretz. She is phenomenal in this, as she is in everything. She will make it far. While i will willingly admit that the Godfather is an epic masterpiece and Shawshank is a powerful tale of redemption, and I love them both, Kick-Ass is one of those I can watch any time anywhere without getting tired of it. Its the action, the comedy and the heart that gives it endless rewatchability and thats what makes it my favorite. Cant wait for Kick-Ass 2."

"BA_Harrison","9","5","9","8 May 2011"," Kick-Ass easily lives up to its title.
","High school nobody and avid comic-book fan Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) decides to stop just reading about super-heroes and begins living the dream, but with no special powers, zero fighting skills, and a distinct lack of high tech gadgetry at his disposal, life as a self-styled crime fighter is harder than he imagined—particularly when hunted down by major-league bad-guy Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong) and made to feel totally inadequate by the real-deal, crime-fighting duo Big Daddy and Hit-Girl (Nicolas Cage and Chloe Moretz).<br/><br/>Kick-Ass is the perfect wake-up call for any comic fan who has ever toyed with the idea of donning a mask and taking to streets in the name of justice (don't tell me you've never imagined yourself in a cool spandex suit with natty matching cape!); rather than painting the fight against crime as a glamorous pursuit, the film graphically displays every ugly detail of life outside of the law and shows what might easily become of anyone foolhardy enough to take on vicious criminals without the proper training (eg., entire childhood spent in a monastery practising martial arts with mystical monks). Brutal stabbings, cold-blooded shootings, and chilling torture are all shown in unflinching detail, making the film a genuine eye-opener (especially for those who might have mistaken this sucker for a light-hearted action/comedy romp).<br/><br/>What is even more surprising than Kick-Ass's ultra-violent content, for me at least, is that it was written, in part, by Jane Goldman, and directed by Matthew Vaughan, both of whom were also responsible for Stardust, a film so contrived and cloying that I would dearly love to erase it from my memory. Here, the pair redeem themselves fully, providing their audience with just shy of two hours of pure awesomeness that constantly delights with its witty, thoughtful script, and endless adrenaline-pumping action scenes (accompanied by a effective score and killer soundtrack).<br/><br/>On top of the remarkable script (based on the comic by Mark Millar) and flawless direction (love the first person shooter style used during one scene), the film also benefits from a stand-out cast, all of whom deliver pitch-perfect performances: Johnson is both likable and believable as the idealistic teenager who turns his life upside down by following his dreams; Lyndsy Fonseca is simply mouth-watering as Katie Deauxma, the object of Dave's desire; Nic Cage puts in yet another seemingly effortless but extremely memorable performance as vengeful ex-cop turned masked avenger Big Daddy (Cage has a blast in his role, even mimicking Adam West's Batman speech mannerisms); and the amazing Moretz regularly steals the show with her confident turn as lethal, 11-year old killing machine Hit Girl (if this promising young actress doesn't go on to be a MAJOR star in the future, I'll eat my cape!).<br/><br/>If, like me, you've grown a little tired of formulaic, big-budget, SFX packed super-hero flicks, I highly recommend checking out this alternative take on the genre, 'cos Kick-Ass easily lives up to its title."

"davidglennjr","9","5","9","24 January 2011"," Amazing Movie
","So there's two things i have to say.<br/><br/>One, if you're watching this to see a super hero movie, and you're a big fan of action with tons of explosions you're not going to get that. It has plenty of action, but it's more fight scenes than explosions and such.<br/><br/>Two, although i didn't originally see this movie in theaters because i thought it looked like more of a kids movie, i was wrong. This movie isn't for young children, lot's of blood, violence, references to sex. My personal opinion is kids under 12 shouldn't watch this. But that's obviously ultimately the parents decision.<br/><br/>The movie was great, no problems with the directing. The pace of the movie keeps you drawn in, never any dull and boring moments like in movies such as 300, Avatar etc. This is easily in my top ten list of movies. I know it won't be firs, because that's taken by The Dark Knight, but i'll probably end up placing it in top five.<br/><br/>Great movie. If you haven't seen it for any reason, try to watch it. It's a masterpiece."
"No_24","1","8","17","3 April 2011"," Avoid at all cost
","I'm going to keep this short and simple. If you've read and loved the comics, stay away from this movie. They slaughter the story, they have some of the same key points but besides that they basically just took the story and decided to ruin it as much as possible. I understand them wanting to change certain aspects of the story such as the violence, but they did much more then that. The casting is terrible with the exception of Chloe Moretz, I loathed Aaron Johnson as kick-ass. He turned Kick-Ass into this self centered jerk who you want to see beat up, he would've been better as a mugger or bully.But like I said in short if you loved the comic you'll hate this movie I couldn't bare to watch it past the five minute mark."
"stiva","10","8","17","4 August 2010"," Kick-Ass just kicks ass...
","Can I simply just say wow!. <br/><br/>Now this is what I call a real superhero comedy movie. The story is simple to its core. It's about a geek who fantasies on becoming a superhero.<br/><br/>The character, Dave, a fan of super-hero comic books one days wonders whether anyone would take a stance and fight against crime. And, thus comes Kick-Ass into the picture. The complexity of the character written for Dave is performed excellently by Aaron Johnson. Who doesn't dream of becoming a super-hero in reality. Dream of being special and do something incredible. The character Dave here is a superhero not because he has super powers, but because he brings the inspiration for turning into a superhero. He successfully shows his strength in fighting crime as a normal human.<br/><br/>The next best thing is the comedy and the timing. A complete blast. This movie will just blow you away. It's not good. It's not great. It's totally awesome. Character Dave dressed up as Kick-Ass and leaves home to fight crime only to find him looking for a lost cat. And the music is the next best part. In the where they play ""For A Few Dollars More"" I just had this feeling like wow. I mean, for that part the music seemed fitting as such the other musical pieces in different parts of the movie. Yes, they seemed to fit well with the movie. <br/><br/>Next, Nicholas Cage as the Big Daddy has his share of the movie. His appearance in this movie will be recognized well. This super-hero, he wants to wipe out the entire the criminal organization which took away his loving wife, shows the anger for his need to wipe out the crime as a human. Wouldn't you want to revenge on the person if he/she took the love of your life ? Nicholas Cage succeeds in showing both the human side as well as the superhero side struggling with the pain. The performance in this movie is class A.<br/><br/>Next thing, my personal favorite, the amazing awesome Chloe Moretz as the Hit Girl. She completely steals away the entire movie. Every scene she's in is a complete delight to watch. Especially the last 25 minutes of the movie where the action sequences are spell-binding. <br/><br/>I have seen lot of bad reviews. I don't care about them as it is impossible to satisfy the entire population of the world. I enjoyed this movie for what it was. A very bold attempt and it served it's purpose excellently well. Extremely funny and little sad filled with some mind blowing adrenaline filled action sequences. <br/><br/>In short, this movie just kicks ass..."

"Indyrod","2","9","20","8 August 2010"," Could have been, but isn't...
","I have mixed feelings on this comic book based film, about a wannabe super-hero kid, that doesn't have any super powers. First time through I didn't like it at all, and then a second viewing with commentary made it a little better. The best part of the film is eleven year old Chloe Moretz, who plays a real super-hero, Hit-Girl, and also Mark Strong as the bad guy. Nicholas Cage as Hit-Girl's super-hero Father, that might be a little over the hill, is a small role but pretty effective, especially when we first meet them with the pistol shooting scene. All in all, it's a very silly film, but definitely not a children's movie, as the violence is pretty graphic and bloody. I can't recommend it, but it does have a couple of good set pieces."
"spaced_89","4","16","41","6 April 2010"," It Should Be Called Ass-Kicked
","Before I go on I would formally like to thank the Brendan Theatre in Las Vegas for hosting a screening of this film.<br/><br/>When seeing this over spring break I was surprised how badly this film played to me. I'm the main demographic it's aimed at (under 25 male) and despite that everyone else at the screening really seemed to enjoy it. I wouldn't have written anything about except the general theme of reviews seems to be that this is Pulp Fiction meets Spiderman.<br/><br/>The story starts off with a voice-over narration of Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) as the overlooked high-schooler who decides that becoming a superhero in this day and age can be achieved. He dons the suit and mask of Kick-Ass and the story goes on. The idea that the premise of Kick-Ass has been done is seemingly lost on director Matthew Vaughn (Layer Cake & Stardust) and he plows ahead acting as if Batman Begins and Spiderman don't exist in the American lexicon. Unfortunately for Kick-Ass he discovers that he isn't even the most qualified vigilante on the streets and is soon outshined by the foul-mouthed and probably deranged Hit-Girl (Chloe Moritz) and Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage doing his best Adam West impersonation). Red Mist also makes an appearance (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) but he's definitely not my cup of tea - in any of his roles.<br/><br/>The violence is controversial just for its own sake really. Hit-Girl (Chloe Moritz) the fan favorite of the audience ends up in a bad way that is really just to gruesome to watch. If you watched No Country for Old Men and thought, ""Why is this Anton Chigurh guy such a choir boy? He should act with some malice!"" then this might be your movie. Anyone else however will probably be disgusted.<br/><br/>But there is one thing I have to say going for it: Aaron Johnson. If I didn't know any better I would say they have found the new Peter Parker for the Marc Webb reboot of Spiderman. Of course now it is unlikely with Sony presumably going for an unknown for the role. Johnson outdoes everyone else in the film and he is easily the most relatable.<br/><br/>Again I don't hate this film (violence against children aside), but it just doesn't seem to have anything going for it.<br/><br/>http://nevermindpopfilm.blogspot.com"
"zenfroglet","6","14","35","29 March 2010"," Close but no cigar...
","I went into Kick-Ass with high hopes. While I despise (and am quite tired of) Mark Millar's showboating, self-hype as well as outright lies, I'm quite a fan of his work.<br/><br/>His two volumes of ""The Ultimates"" comics are perhaps the single highlight at Marvel Comics (for my sensibilities at least) in the last decade. Indeed, they are rightfully being used as the inspiration for the current stock of the ""Marvel Heroes"" (Iron Man/Cap/Hulk/Thor) films.<br/><br/>While Wanted was horribly translated to film, Kick-Ass by all indications is a more faithful adaption. Probably helped by Millar producing the affair.<br/><br/>That said, Kick-Ass, as has been criticised on many occasions by various reviewers I've recently read, tries to have its cake and eat it. It tries to force you to accept that this story takes place in our real world, and then goes back on this idea and tries to give you something out of Kill Bill. Pure fantasy fiction. A bit like Millar in that respect, promising one thing only to give you something else. If used properly this could be quite surprising and fresh, but unfortunately it's ultimately ineffective here as it just confuses the tone and theme and left me unsatisfied with the film as a whole.<br/><br/>Is it entertaining? For sure! Does it have a decent soundtrack? You know it! Does it feel fresh? Hmmm, kinda. Is it ***hyper reality insane bubblegum superhero antics that changes things forever***? Not quite. There are some seconds where I had thought Millar had elevated comic book films to a new level...only to lose it a few seconds later.<br/><br/>Think of it as Spiderman crossed with Kill Bill. Only less awesome than that sounds.<br/><br/>I'm interested though, I'll look forward to Millar's next efforts/translations. Surely he can only improve? In the meantime, if you really want a film about what superheroes would be like in real life, try ""Super""."

","The trailers for this film looked like it had a lot of potential and for once the film was everything hinted at in the trailer and more. The main plot of teenagers dressing up as super heroes with predictable consequences was well written, acted, and very funny. Aaron is a teenager who buys a wet suit and calls himself ""Kick Ass"". He fancies himself a crime fighter but most of the time ends up getting his own ass kicked. <br/><br/>What makes this movie special, unforgettable really, is the performance of Chloe Moretz, who plays the role of ""Hit Girl"", the daughter of ""Big Daddy"" (Nicholas Cage). Her introduction has to be one of the all time great action scenes ever. I'm not being overly generous. ""Kick Ass"" was trying to persuade a local drug dealer to stop harassing a girl ""Kick Ass"" was in love with, and when the drug dealer was about to dispatch ""Kick Ass"" to the afterlife, we are introduced to ""Hit Girl"", who proceeded to deal with the drug dealer and his room full of thugs, while the theme song from ""The Banana Splits"" blared. My god it was awesome.<br/><br/>I don't know about ""Kick Ass"" the character, but ""Hit Girl"" could start a franchise with this movie. The violence was over the top but in a fun comic book sort of way. Peter Parker's Spiderman can't hold a candle to ""Hit Girl"".<br/><br/>Anyway, the movie was way cool and totally worth checking out. I'll probably see it again."
"killb-94","4","4","7","9 April 2012"," My all time favorite Film
","Kick-Ass is my all time favorite movie. Why? Because it has EVERYTHING I always love: surreal images, dark comedy, over the top jokes, bloody fight scenes, good character development and of course superheroes. I can't see why some people said that the main character doesn't do nothing. Dave Lizewski single-handedly saved a man's life and just about every word that pours from his mouth (and narration) is worth quoting. He's the only person fighting criminals without a personal vendetta and a character that you genuinely feel bad for when he gets publicly tortured, and it feels good when he redeems himself at the end. Aside of the original graphic novel, one of my favorite comic books is Leo Ortolani's ""Rat-Man"" and Kick-Ass looks like a live-action version with humans of it, because it shows what the superheroes really mean and their true messages. I like how it's tone ranges from light and droll to dark and brooding. This movie is an insane mix: it's an action movie, a gangster movie, a comedy movie, a high school-buddy movie, a dramatic movie and of course a superhero movie, it has everything! The only downfall of the film in my opinion is the romantic factor between Dave and Katie, it was seriously unacceptable and rushed, even in a movie like this one. But aside of that, I truly adore Kick-Ass. I love how wicked it is, I love how dark it is, I love how frigging' weird it is and most of all I love how spontaneously and without fear takes risks in several points of the plot. I could watch this movie over and over and never get tired of it. It's odd, it's creative, it's my all time favorite movie."
"s-woods-813-264430","10","7","15","17 August 2010"," Been hit by a freight train yet?...
","No!... Then you haven't seen Kick-Ass.<br/><br/>Watching this film is like getting a legal high. It will have an amazing effect on you physiologically. After you have watched it for the first time, you immediately want to watch it again. It will become addictive, you will get withdrawal symptoms if you go more than two days without your Kick-Ass fix.<br/><br/>I have never before seen a movie that has such an effect on you.<br/><br/>Why didn't you go to the theatre to watch it? Probably because you watched the trailer and thought it was a lame superhero movie and will wait to rent it on DVD. BIG MISTAKE.<br/><br/>THIS MOVIE WILL BLOW YOUR MIND.<br/><br/>The trailer gives no clue about the emotional and adrenaline pumping experience you will get when you watch this film. By the end of the movie you will be a quivering mess wondering what just hit you.<br/><br/>All the performances are outstanding and will no doubt receive a great deal more offers based on their performances in this film.<br/><br/>However there is one performance that has to be seen to be believed. CHLOE MORETZ (11 years old at the time) plays Hit Girl. It is a performance that takes this film from the great to the truly unimaginably outstanding. When you watch her as either Mindy or Hit Girl you are witnessing something special. Compare Chloe to most (if not all) other Hollywood actors/actresses and you will see the difference. She ACTUALLY BECOMES THAT CHARACTER on set. Almost like a split-personality she actually seems to be able to completely block out her own personality and project the character she is playing like no-one else I have ever seen before. Watch her on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno or on Ellen (both can be seen on youtube). Her charisma and maturity at such a young age put most other so-called stars in the shade. The many clips of Chloe that are available on youtube are a must see. One of the best is the Hit Girl interview she does for Empire magazine on set in her Hit Girl outfit. Watch and while bearing in mind that she was 11 at the time prepare to be blown away."
"ruink","9","7","15","15 July 2010"," A Legendary Cinematic Experience.
","Kick-Ass is one the best cinematic experiences I will never forget. Period... Now onto the review!<br/><br/>The story of Kick-Ass is quite simple yet extremely original that makes for a fantastic movie going experience. The film takes the concept of a Bruce Wayne, or a Tony Stark esquire concept and projects it in a literal form. It asks the question: what would happen if an average Joe...or teenager in this case would pose as a masked vigilante and decide to fight crime? The main character in this film, High School comic book geek Dave, played by the wonderful Aaron Johnson, decides to put this question to the test and decides to pose as Kick-Ass. His motive for this task as I said before is to answer the inevitable question and decides to stand up to crime when other people don't. When taking on the responsibility of Kick-Ass he finally gets a chance to fight crime against three hoodlums. When fighting them a crowd is gathered around a fight filming Kick Ass with their camera phones, Youtube Gear what have you. This video of Kick Ass fighting crime causes a Youtube sensation and gains much popularity. Little dos Kick Ass know though, that he has just entered a realm of other masked vigilantes. These other crime fighters are Big Daddy played in prime form by Mr. Nick Cage. And Big Daddy's daughter Hit Girl, which is a surreal performance by the new young comer Chloe Moretz. These two vigilantes have a mission themselves to stop a local Drug Lord in town played by Mark Strong(whom by the way is the main villain) who Bigg Daddy has personal beef with. Something i wont spoil. Oh and how could I forget the hilarious Red Mist played by the charming Mclov'n himself, Chris Mintz Plasse. All these characters and stories tie in a very clever manner that is blast to sit through.<br/><br/>So what do you get with Kick-Ass? A movie that in my opinion is one of the only movies I have ever seen to coming close to perfection. Call my boasting propaganda but I seriously have no complaints here. This film has essentially everything that makes a film enjoyable; great directing, great writing, great acting, and memorable characters. Sure the story has no real deep intellectual moral behind it aside from telling to stand for others when others don't, but it's how this story is told about a few characters whom we come to love and care about. We care about their actions and we feel connected to them. Vaughn has somehow grounded this film in reality yet takes us on a journey larger than life. And succeeds in doing so. So in summary what is Kick-Ass? It is simply put the best super-hero movie ever made if not one of the best movies ever made in general. Period."

This film is an immaculate blend of Kill Bill,Spiderman,The Dark Knight,Fight Club,and Superbad. Amazing.

","To tell you honestly, I first checked out its rating here before watching it. I said to my self. ""Why the heck does just about every hyped new movie is included in the top 250?"" But after watching it, it deserved to be in that list. If Spiderman, Sin City, Reservoir Dogs, Kill Bill are in the top 250, I see no reason why Kickass would not be. The movie was well made, the action sequence was well directed combined with the background music during fight scenes. And the most amazing part of the movie is the scene where Hitgirl ""sobbed"" subtly, the way she put out the fire, the way she said ""Good night"". It appears that even in her most traumatic and saddest moment, she was still as tough as what Big Daddy taught her to be. Should be nominated for best dramatic scene or best violent scene whichever you prefer.<br/><br/>Sometimes old-timers like to hold on to their best movies of all times, they call every good new movie overrated. when in fact at times history is happening in front of their eyes. This will go down to be the Reservoir Dogs of 21st century, just more entertaining."

","I heard about this film from my friend, and from what he told me and from the little I knew beforehand about the film, this is the picture I got:<br/><br/>It would be a quite ordinary Hollywood film. Just another teen-comedy with some under-the-belt humor and some mediocre acting. Predictable, of course, perhaps tedious, and absolutely without a message or any depth.<br/><br/>I figured I'd just watch it to pass some time, perhaps have a laugh or two, and if I got lucky; see some watch-worthy fight scenes. Now I can not begin to describe how entirely blown out of my seat I was. I had never expected any of what Kick-Ass was.<br/><br/>With perfect pacing I was taken on a journey through really great scenes, nice cinematography, good acting, funny and refreshing dialog and _story_. Yes, above all story. I never would have thought this movie would have any sort of profound story, but oh man was I wrong. I started realizing, a bit into it, that this movie actually had story; that it had meaning. There was a background, a motivation for everything that happened. This movie was thought through.<br/><br/>Then I was blown away again when Nicolas Cage popped up in the movie. I had no idea he was in it, and his role and his acting it just brought some... magnitude to the movie.<br/><br/>Then I was blown away AGAIN when the ""gore"" scenes made their entrance. I sure didn't see that coming. It elevated the movie to a whole nother level.<br/><br/>Then there I sat; shocked, thrilled, mesmerized. And I enjoyed my way through the movie as the story unfolded and took turns, as pleasant and thrilling, interesting or funny scene after scene rolled by.<br/><br/>And at the end of the movie, as the credits started rolling, and as I started coming back to planet earth. And all that had happened was run through my head, I just thought: ""Man! What an experience!""<br/><br/>That's what it was: it truly was an experience. And what still puzzles me... what I still can't really grasp, is this:<br/><br/>This is a really light-weight movie - with a profound depth.<br/><br/>Cause it truly is light-weight. This is no Schindler's List or Requiem for a Dream or any other movie that puts you out of phase and forces you to contemplate for a moment before you get back to reality. <br/><br/>Still, at different points in this movie, some scenes, some lines, I was as deeply touched and emotionally engaged as I was during great films such as The Shawshank Redemption. And that just puzzles me... how can this, quite simple movie, have such an effect, such an impact?<br/><br/>I guess that's just what you call great film-making. <br/><br/>And for this, Kick-Ass earns a 10 from me. For it's sheer effect. The surprise, followed by the enthrallment that ended in stupefied delightfulness.<br/><br/>Thanks to everyone who made this movie happen! Go see it !<br/><br/>Peace."

","Because it was awesome! I had read about it, including an article the new yorker did and some reviews, I'd seen a preview too but I still expected it to be pretty stupid and a 20somethig comedy. I'll tell you though, I have used IMDb since it started, for YEARS and this is MY FIRST REVIEW! because this movie was fantastic. The new yorker article was talking about the exploitation of hit girl, and the sexualization of a minors, and all the violence, and I might normally agree in other instances but they were WAY off base. This is not a movie for kids, but I think there is nothing wrong with it. If anything it captured the depravity of corrupted youth more honestly than I have ever seen. And if you don't think so you're kidding yourself. And you be very surprised to spend anytime as a kid again living these days. The nonchalant sex and drug use was spot on. That's not something that is portrayed honestly in America. It's either written too stiff or worse too cool. This movie was hilarious and I will be buying the DVD and doing whatever else I can to support the filmmakers. I am truly shocked at how much I liked this movie. After how many years it compelled me to write a review on here. I don't do that. Enough said."
"bob the moo","Null","7","15","17 May 2010"," Entertainingly violent and care-free if not as smart or as funny as it wants to be
","Kick-Ass caused a fair bit of hand-wringing when it came out in the UK – and of course most of it was from the media outlets such as the Daily Mail where all their commentary only appears to have two modes – (1) hand-wringing and (2) smug superiority. Anyway, the issue appeared to be that this was a very violent film with very strong language and that it contained a child actor involved in all of it. On one hand one could question the decision by the parents to let a child do this even in play-acting, but to be honest the film is so gloriously over-the-top that it never takes itself seriously and is unlike to bring about the collapse of society that Tooky predicted in his review.<br/><br/>This level of attack has unfortunately sparked the opposite extreme – where those that like the film feel they have to love the film and praise it as much as the detractors hate it. This is unfortunate because the film does not deserve to be either blamed for society's woes or to be praised to the high-heavens as if it were the most clever subversive film ever made. The truth is that Kick-Ass is very entertaining in an excessive and ridiculous way. Taken as a response to the darker comic-book movies of recent years, Kick-Ass revels in the ridiculousness of it all, having little pops at the genre clichés and taking everything to a silly excess. In doing this it is consistently funny and entertaining in a trashy way.<br/><br/>The references will probably date it somewhat in time, but the nods towards other genre films and things such as Modern Warfare 2 will be appreciated by the target audience. The violence may be condemned for being excessive and gratuitous but doing so is a matter of taste since this is really the point of it – it is supposed to be OTT and it is weirdly enjoyable for it. I don't agree with those that would have this be something it is not though and it is not a film that makes full use of the potential to be smart and make comment. The potential is there though but if it does start out with some clever ideas, these are generally surrendered as the film goes along – it doesn't affect how entertaining it is, but it prevents it being as clever and as memorable a film as it could have been.<br/><br/>The cast buy into the excessive nature of it very much and it is they that help carry it along. Johnson in the lead plays his geeky part well, although he was always going to be in the shadow of Mortez, who delivers with great presence and charisma throughout the film. True there is a strange air to seeing a child do what she does but this does not detract from her performance and it is not her fault the material did not make slightly more intelligent use of her character being in this excessive mode. Cage is the big name and is he good playing it for gentle laughs – his imitation of Adam West when in character is a great touch. Supporting is roundly good (and within the tone of the rest of the film) from Strong, Mintz-Plasse, Rispoli and others.<br/><br/>Kick-Ass is not the anti-Christ but neither is it the wonderfully brilliant film that others would claim as it doesn't deliver on the potential to be clever and to be subversive. However the resulting excessive comic-book movie is still very enjoyable and funny and if this is what you are looking for then it does deliver on that."
"SaMoFilmGuy","3","8","18","25 August 2010"," Really? One of the top 250 films? Really?
","There are a few fun action scenes, but they're a small proportion of the overall action, and the movie overall is very poorly structured. (It's two hours long and it takes 40 minutes for the only strong characters, Nick Cage and Chloe Moretz, to finally appear.) The acting is so-so, with Cage doing a goofy impersonation and Moretz not terribly gifted at all -- she sounds like what she is: a little kid saying lines. The high school ""nerd"" (Aaron Johnson) is too genteel and good- looking to be considered on the fringe, but his buddies (Clark Duke and especially Evan Peters) make good funny faces. Superbad's Christopher Mintz-Plasse walks through his uninspired role, unable to play off a totally dour Mark Strong (who as a comic villain should display some humor). Michael Rispoli is his usual annoying self, playing what he always plays, unconvincingly, a rotund little mafioso, but Lyndsy Fonseca plays the cute girl cutely. Very much a modern Hollywood vehicle: technically proficient but overloud, overlong and stick characters were supposed to love immediately. And lots of violence and bad words to make it edgy. Ugh."
"whitnall","6","8","18","25 April 2010"," Chloe Moretz steals the show
","The best scenes by far involve pint-sized Chloe Moretz in an homage to Uma Thurman of Kill Bill. In addition to her action scenes, there is some very funny dialog with her father, played by Nicolas Cage. Otherwise, it's a cute concept and interesting plot, but a lot of the dialog and acting fall flat. But there are enough exciting action scenes and moments of cleverness to keep you going through the boring, silly parts. Seeing a film like this makes you realize how great the writing was in the Kill Bills, and even in sappy movies like the Spiderman series. Part of why I saw this film was Christopher Mintz-Plasse in the cast, because of Superbad. His quirky personality adds something to the movie, but he's kind of wasted here. Here's hoping the sequel will be centered around Chloe Moretz!"
"new-spirit-jazz","1","9","21","4 June 2010"," Another movie of the New American Madness
","I'll give you an important piece of background information that will help you understand this movie: Hollywood, just like most of America, is in the process of turning insane.<br/><br/>That's why the movies coming out of America in recent years make less and less sense.<br/><br/>""Kick-Ass"" is a fairly clear example for this tendency. Superficially, it resembles formats of older, saner movies. It is a bit of Spiderman, a bit of ""The Incredibles"" and a bit of a dozen other movies.<br/><br/>But behind the facade, madness lurks. The ""good guys"" in the movie are not good at all. They kill just as mercilessly and indiscriminately as the supposed ""bad guys"" (or even more so): It's all just one big mess of violence.<br/><br/>This disgusting, graphic violence is mixed with sappy cuteness. An eleven-year old girl - and she really is cute, I have to admit - goes on a killing spree. Together with her gun-crazy father. I beg your pardon: THAT'S your ""story""? One of the worst scenes is when one of the ""superheros"" shoots the little ""superhero"" girl in the chest. For no reason. With no warning. Just like that. That actually physically shocked me and I hated the writers for it. Such a vile scene. Who'd write a thing like that?<br/><br/>It's insanity, no more, no less. A movie like the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan: No purpose, no mission, no real enemies, just violence, violence, violence.<br/><br/>I did enjoy some parts of the movie - it was funny here and there -, but mostly I was just appalled by this cinematic insult to everything which is good and right."
"Likes_Ninjas90","6","10","24","11 April 2010"," Its sense of style and comical tone come at the expense of the reality and the humanity
","Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) is a teenage geek who loves comics and is fascinated by superheroes. He asks his two best friends why no one has ever tried to be one. Regularly preyed upon by bullies, he orders a costume off the Internet and decides to become a vigilante, calling himself Kick-Ass. His first task of taking down two criminals results in him being left in hospital. To his dismay, a rumour is also spread around the school that he is gay which catches gets the attention of his dream girl Katie (Lyndsy Fonseca). Declining to give up on Kick-Ass, Dave makes a comeback and saves a thugs life during a fight. As the status of Kick-Ass increases, he finds fame and popularity on the Internet through social networking sites. Meanwhile, crime boss and coke dealer Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong) is tormented by a father and daughter pair of superheroes called Big Daddy (Nicholas Cage) and Hit-Girl (Chloe Moretz) who have their motives for battling crime together. Frank is also regularly pestered by his son Chris (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), who is willing to do anything to be part of the family business.<br/><br/>Although this ultra-violent adaptation of the graphic Marvel comic book Kick-Ass might seem like a parody of superhero films, there is not enough effort to transcend a number of the clichés that the script has been written around. Dave regularly reminds the audience that he is just an ordinary geek, but the plot still owes all too much to the first Spider-man film. The initial donning of the daggy costume, the chance to win the girl of his dreams, the inexperience of early battles and the dilemma between personal relationships and duty, are just some of the familiar grounds that Kick-Ass insists on covering once again. The film is at its funniest when it directly references and parodies other films, like cutting to Dave as he stands at a grave, vowing his revenge during a thunderstorm. However, Kick-Ass desperately lacks the sincerity of Sam Raimi's superhero films, which skilfully balanced the most fantastical elements with moments of humanity. Peter Parker might have been a geek but he was not a caricature. The reality of his problems, like his job and his relationships, made him a believable and interesting person outside of Spider-man. Dave has been written like a stereotype and the obligatory traits, like being girl shy and the masturbation jokes, are in check. There are certainly some laughs from the protagonist, but a lot the humour in the film is lowbrow and cringeworthy at times, asserting the films highly exaggerated and goofy tone.<br/><br/>A lot of the controversy surrounding Kick-Ass has stemmed from the high levels of comic violence. The film is certainly gruesome, over the top and gratuitous but what is more concerning is that there is a distinct lack of tension in a number of the fight scenes. Matthew Vaughn's direction is problematic because he has chosen to stage the battles like a series of MTV music videos, with rapid cutting and a noisy rock soundtrack. Some are indeed stylish and well choreographed, but bar one surprising ambush, the reality of being a vigilante is largely diminished. If the fights had been more grounded in reality, and the tone of the rest of the film was not so comical, the physical dangers might have to come to the foray. It is left to shock moments, like an early knife wound, to remind one of the risks. Unfortunately, the predictable climax removes any doubt as to whether the film is romanticising violence, with dual weapons wielding and acrobatics taking prominence over reality, boring some but most likely satisfying the sugar rush of twitchy adolescent video game fans.<br/><br/>Aaron Johnson made a very solid impression playing the young John Lennon in Nowhere Boy and here he and his friends are reasonably likable enough characters, despite the limited scope of the characterisation. They have a few funny lines but their relationships, specifically Dave's courting of Katie, are largely superfluous. The latter really only seems to be exist place to titillate teenage viewers and include a familiar dilemma between risk and romance, very much like Spider-man's relationship with Mary Jane or even Bruce Wayne's predicament with Rachel Dawes in The Dark Knight. Chloe Moretz has an energetic and bloody entrance as Hit-Girl. While her costume and purple wig are radical, the film really does not know what to do with her. She is a sketch of a cool idea rather than a fully fleshed out character. Surprisingly, Mark Strong has a livelier role than Cage, who does not bring as many laughs as one might expect. His stuttering speech patterns when in costume are just odd rather than funny.<br/><br/>Kick-Ass is certainly a wild ride but it is certain to present conflicting emotions for viewers. Some will be excited by the high levels of violence and the stylishly constructed action sequences. Yet others are likely to find the gore unnerving or simply pointless. Beneath the blood there is a highly familiar and overlong narrative, derived from predictable plot points, uneven performances and juvenile humour. It has been slickly made but its sense of style and comical tone come at the expense of the reality and the humanity."

","I cannot stop thinking about it this movie. I am obsessed. I am going to see it a third time this week.<br/><br/>I saw the trailer for it in the theater, and my immediate reaction was ""No f---ing way am I seeing that."" It had the stench of teen comedy all over it, and I hate teen comedies.<br/><br/>Then the red band trailers sparked mild interest, but I cannot recommend those to you because they are spoilerific. Then came the early reviews from the UK, where it first opened, and they were quite positive. Then, largely positive scores from the review sites. So I saw it. I threw together a group of friends so that fun would be had no matter whether the movie sucked or not. It did not suck.<br/><br/>I remember the feeling I had after I saw Die Hard. Wholly unexpected jubilation, and a strong desire to introduce others to a great film. I haven't experienced that feeling to that degree since. Until now.<br/><br/>I won't/can't say much about the film itself or why it rocks so hard, and you have seen too many spoilers as it is, if you have expressed any interest at all. I will say that I want to give Nic Cage a hug. I will also say that, when Arnold retired from action film, I wondered who the next badass action hero would be. Duane ""The Rock"" Johnson? That was everyone's guess, but that didn't happen. Jackie Chan wants to do drama now. Jet Li is getting too old for wire work. Ray Stevenson was a great Punisher, but approximately six people saw that wonderful movie.<br/><br/>I never thought that my next action-hero badass idol would be a twelve year old girl.<br/><br/>The work of Macready/Moretz draws upon the speed and agility of Chan, the wire work of Jet Li, the pistol-handling ability of Chow Yun-Fat, the steely-eyed confidence of Clint Eastwood, and the relentless determination of Arnold. All while smiling with glee, like... no action hero I've ever seen before. I want more.<br/><br/>Apparently I am not alone. In one of many positive reviews I've read, the reviewer mentions going home and immediately putting Hit Girl wallpaper on his computer. I did that too, and so will some of you I bet. It's not as creepy as you might think. You will understand if you see the movie.<br/><br/>This could just be honeymoon phase. Die-Hard has withstood the 20 year test of time. So has Robocop, and so has Road Warrior. This film might withstand that same time test, and it might not. But at this moment, it is a favorite.<br/><br/>It should be noted that all the casting is superb. Bravo to whoever did the casting.<br/><br/>I laughed, and I generally hate comedies. I cried, and I haven't cried in a movie theater since I saw Old Yeller as a kid.<br/><br/>This film is not for everyone! It is not for the squeamish; there are parts with a decent level of hack and slash violence. It is also NOT FOR KIDS. As Moretz herself says in an interview I read, it is R rated for a reason. cinemablend.com/new/Interview-Chloe-Moretz-Is-Hit-Girl-18116.html<br/><br/>Schwarzenegger. Stallone. Chan. Yun-Fat. Moretz.<br/><br/>Please, Hollywood, treat her well. Be kind.<br/><br/>Everybody else who appreciates good action film: Please see this movie. Thanks!"

If it had just been a story about a teenage guy trying to be a superhero and fail and learn a lesson in the process, it would have probably turned into something interesting. But this retarded gore main plot takes over and degenerates completely. Major spoilers ahead: from the beginning, I was appalled seeing the father shooting his daughter... oh, she wears a bullet proof vest, he's training her, get it? Well, you have to be mentally deranged to get it. This little girl dressed up like a hooker slices, strangles and shoots people, talks dirty, gets smashed and beaten up ferociously and feels like if they had thrown in a rape scene, it would have been just the same. From this point on, you don't even care about the gayish looking, self proclaimed onanist main hero, who obviously gets the girl, or the final ""exuberant"" bazooka killing, as your mind tries to cope and fit this in a pattern of sick fantasy that you want to stay away from."
"dsangari","2","8","19","8 September 2010"," Another example of bad marvel comics inspired cinema- Spoiler alert!
","Why is it that comic book adaptations are considered sacrosanct territory in Hollywood? Are they just not one more way of entertaining middle class people... In a nation where Batman is considered the height of subversiveness and Iron-man the new age patriot, Marvel inspired filmmaking just hit a new low. Kick ass opens with Aaron Johnson as Dave, a 16 year who wants to be a superhero and tells all of us that the real world of doctors, lawyers and bus drivers is plain ole boring. One day (inexplicably) he buys a green suit(for $99 that no one knows how he came by!) online, and starts off in the good-guy business. Using police batons to beat up 'bad guys' he makes it to the you-tube top 10, and is noticed by veteran superhero Big Daddy ala Nicholas Cage and his 11 year old daughter/disciple/guinea pig in the experimental art of murder, arson, shooting and stabbing 'Hit Girl' played by Chloe Moretz. Eventually Dave gets laid by his high school sweetheart and then finds himself drawn into battling Big and Hit's arch nemesis Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong)and his treacherous son+ wannabe superhero Red-mist ala Chris Mintz. Daddy ends up dead, and Kick and Hit join forces to end the film in an orgy of vengeance. Apart from the mediocre acting, pointless characters and mostly absent plot line, it was an entertaining film for those who it targeted (teenagers and wannabe superheroes!) For me, there are some glaring and basic problems with this piece of celluloid. First, I feel that unlike most superhero comics this film did not contain any sort of message for its audience. Second, from start to finish the film shows (almost lovingly) the violent and vicious acts committed by the protagonists. Thirdly the film foists a rather skewed morality on its viewers by repeatedly asserting that in todays America, (where you can get 20 years for sex with a 'minor' but be out in 7 for murder of a minor!) young people (preteens, adolescents and older teens) must be ready to combat violence with violence, that its okay for little kids to shoot, stab, maim, kill and decapitate those that they perceive as a threat. Thus the film unwittingly ends up siding with kids who carry knives and guns to school and train in violent combative skills from an early age, and going against kids who may choose other means of 'expression'. The unflinching and graphic cinematic display of children 'coming of age' by committing violence, and, the scantiness or absence of other expressions (sexual, familial, social, athletic, artistic etc)show the great puritanical, ageist and self righteous American paranoia of 'realism'. In short Kick Ass seems to be glorifying murder and aggression by showing kids that love is overrated and war is underrated. It seems to be a recruiting poster for a new 'generation kill' in USA where its okay for a 13-16 year old to know all about where bullets, F-16's and bazookas come from and how to use them,... but not okay for them to know where babies come from and what youth,love, passion, talent and life are actually all about! That is why such trash is NEVER made in Europe."

","For some reason this annoyed me greatly. As a movie it poses a lot and pretends smarts it hasn't earned for itself. The idea to elevate a comic-book fantasy above comic-book fantasy so it can poke fun at superhero conventions is a pretension, when all the ""the mayor signals to us with a light the shape of a gigantic c-ck"" cuteness is played out Kick-Ass shows us the best movie it knows to be. It pokes fun at the contrived trauma that creates a vigilante, Dave before a tombstone saying ""I will avenge you mother"", then gives us the same for Hit Girl and Big Daddy in a big slab of backstory thrown at the audience. It gives us a love interest so bland and worthless as to make Loys Lane seem like an intriguing character. I don't like the type of cutesy quirky film defined by smug irony but since someone bothered to make this I want to see it have the strength of its convictions.<br/><br/>I want to see a Kick-Ass with the balls to be what it needs to be. Play cute cheerie music over a scene where a little girl cuts up a bunch of thugs but don't give us a sirupy Big Daddy death. Don't give us b-llocks of realism about an ordinary guy who wears a wetsuit and plays the part of the superhero to dismal failure, then turn him into a jet pack flying cartoon by the end. It's all very half a##ed to me. ""Shockingly"" ironic when it needs to make fun of superhero clichés, then a superhero fantasy where justice is served and the good guy gets the girl to give us the vicarious fulfillment. Selectively poking fun at cliché then using it as a shorthand for character - there goes another awkward nerdy guy who can't get a girlfriend. Mainly I don't like this because it thinks it's smart enough to express itself through other peoples' work (I cringed when they randomly used Morricone) yet forgets to take a long hard look at its own mess."
"debjyoti1981","9","7","16","22 May 2010"," Amazing !!!
","Amazing is what I think about this movie right now.<br/><br/>If truth be told, Matthew Vaughn's 'Kick-Ass' has given us a new edge in the comic based movies.<br/><br/>Actions are fast and gritty still it has the essence of some comic relief in between to have some light moments.<br/><br/>The story is simple, where a regular teenager round the block decides to be a super hero calling himself as 'Kick-Ass' and faces the reality of what it takes to be a 'Hero'. Circumstances changes when he comes across vigilante father and daughter team who call themselves as 'Big Daddy' and 'Hit Girl'; who clean the streets by killing the men working for powerful drug Lord Frank D'Amico. Well... I will not go into any further details because it surly will give away the plot and I don't wish to do so for those who haven't seen this movie yet.<br/><br/>Aaron Johnson as 'Kick Ass' has really done a great job, but the main lure for this movie is Chloë Moretz as 'Hit Girl'; she is simply awesome. Nicolas Cage as 'Big Daddy' or rather the side kick had been perfect and revived himself in a much better way than what we have seen in his earlier title at 'Ghost Rider'.<br/><br/>Remember 'Sin City' this movie too has lots of profanity and violence; no doubt this got 'R' rating but I will not at all be complaining because this movie has offered us exactly what we wanted to see. <br/><br/>The soundtrack is also soothing and by the time the credit rolls the song 'Kick Ass' by Mika will be lingering in the mind for quite some time. This movie is surly not to be missed. So far 2010 start has offered some good movies, apart from 'Shutter Island' I can say 'Kick- Ass' can too join the league of success.<br/><br/>I don't know whether any sequel will be upcoming or not but as a stand alone title this will unquestionably win the universal movie goers heart and support.<br/><br/>This movie really KICKS ASS!!!! In every literal sense<br/><br/>Well ""Shut Up. Kick-Ass"" :)"

","Dave Lizewski is your average high school student that has no excitement to speak of in his life, other than his two best friends. He orders a superhero costume with every intention of stopping crime on the streets and declares himself ""Kick-Ass"". During a car theft attempt, Dave valiantly fights them, but he gets critically injured. After his recovery, Dave becomes a You Tube sensation and falls in love with high school crush, Katie Deauxma. Dave teams up with Big Daddy & Hit-Girl to take down the evil Frank D'Amico<br/><br/>This is not your average superhero flick, far from it. This one is all too real. Dave doesn't have any overwhelming superhero powers as Kick- Ass and he is the farthest thing from invincible. I always love it when a superhero is set in the real world. They even add social media sites, like You Tube and the Craig Ferguson show to make it all the more genuine. It really is a near brilliant satire. It is extremely well written and gives us exciting action and a top-notch story. Those that are squeamish will probably loathe this movie. Kick-Ass is explicitly violent, almost to the point of being cartoonish. I'm sure there are plenty of pundits that will bemoan and carp about this being vulgar and how it is sending the wrong message to people. If you're one of those people, lighten up! I'm not saying I agree with vigilantism or anything like that, I just don't find cartoonish violence offensive. I got so much out of this movie for many reasons. Who hasn't wanted to make a difference in this world at some point? Any good person is probably disgusted at events that happen in this world, but we lack the stones and conviction to do something about it. We care about all of the good guys in this one, regardless of whether what they are doing is considered right or wrong. Dave Lizewski is a normal human being like the rest of us. He takes a stand because he strongly believes in what he's doing. How can you not admire that? I thought Aaron Taylor-Johnson did a wonderful job as our brave hero. He is easy to relate too and has a geeky charm that is impossible to dislike. Nicolas Cage gives one of his best performance in years. This is what the man is capable of when fully motivated. I don't see how anyone could complain about his performance. Chloë Grace Moretz is excellent as Cage's daughter. She was bad-ass for her age. She might have given the best performance and that's quite a statement. I loved the Cage & Moretz tandem. Lyndsy Fonseca is absolutely gorgeous and solid as the love interest. Christopher Mintz-Plasse is good, if a little annoying at times. His Red Mist character was amusing most of the time. The rest of the cast is good as well. <br/><br/>Final Thoughts: This movie ponders this question. How far are you willing to go for another human being in need? It is ambitious, exciting, authentic, and wonderfully irreverent. This movie isn't for the squeamish. But those that are looking for a different superhero film that is full of realism? This one is for you. It is one of my favorites and I proudly own the DVD. <br/><br/>9.4/10"
"Mr_Sensitive","9","3","5","30 November 2011"," The Most Fun Movie Experience In Superheroes Genes.
","One of the most satisfying action movies I have seen in a very long time, so good that I actually forgot what other movies I have seen recently.<br/><br/>Synopsis: Dave is a typical high school comic book nerd who one day decides to become a super hero, even though he has no powers. Things never go right from the start and only got worse when he got intertwine with the mafia who is out to kill him.<br/><br/>What I love about this movie was it bases its story on reality. There are no super power, no nothing – just a simple geek pretend to be a super hero and basically everything that would happen if one pretends they are a superhero. <br/><br/>Kick-Ass might not be the most original movie but it is among the best executed superhero movie ever created. I think the R rated really help bringing out the best of its story because it is so intelligence and so violent it is satisfying to watch (really tired to see this PG13 superhero movie).<br/><br/>Anyway the casting got to be one of the highlight of the movie with the Hit Girl came out as the most lovable character with her sharp witted sarcasm and her ability to kill. By the end you seriously want more of her. Nic Cage did seriously surprise me here – Big Daddy totally rock! His solo fight got to be one of the best action sequences (Which later topple by a scene by Hit Girl save Big Daddy Scene). Dave (aka Kick-Ass) is one of the most realistic superhero. He is courageous but also very fragile.<br/><br/>The movie also comes in with brilliant score and music that fitted perfectly with the mood and tone of the movie especially during the action sequences. I guess it is the good thing when the studio decides someone with great vision do the movie. Matthew Vaughn really turning himself into one of the most sought after director in Hollywood.<br/><br/>Overall the movie fulfills my every expectation. One of the very few action movies that managed to do almost everything right. Totally fell in love with it. <br/><br/>Recommendation: Yes, Get yourself a BlueRay !! <br/><br/>Rating: A<br/><br/>* Give it a 9/10 for too open ending."
"supertivzenda","7","3","5","27 December 2010"," The movie Kick Ass is unapologetic in it's gratuitous violence, cheesiness, and it is a cliché in every way. One of the best ""super hero"" movies I've ever seen.
","*May Contain some Spoilers *May Contain some Spoilers<br/><br/>The movie Kick Ass is unapologetic in it's gratuitous violence, cheesiness, and it is a cliché in every way. While viewing the first 35 minutes the movie seems to be the usual uncreative ""blockbuster,"" movie many movie goers have come to expect and hopelessly pay for. The script is equipped with the typically, nauseating and rehashed plot expected from one of today's top major studios and film crews. Have you ever seen anything so unoriginal? Nerd is a nerd. Nerd gets tired of being picked on for being a nerd. Nerd also likes girl. Nerd attempts to kick ass. Nerd scares girl after breaking into her house by sneaking into her window. Girl Changes mind after nerd says I'm sorry. Nerd turns girl on. Nerd and girl have sex after girl reconsiders pressing charges and filing a restraining order. But this is the whole point, me thinks. Unlike the scary movie series, Kick Ass mixes sharp satire with actual thoughtful artistic integrity. And after watching the movie I must say, Kick ass was one of the funnest movies I've seen in a while. How? How can a used up clichéd plot, stereotypical paper cutout characters, and violence in abundance equal FUN???? <br/><br/>Kick Ass shows us what would happen to Peter Parker if he were in the world of Facebook and social networking. The information age, a gift and a curse, where two girls performing bodily functions in a cup can garner global mass media attention in minutes, and where profound words can go unseen. A place where everyone can have his/her own broadcast for an outlet, to entertain to be heard; It is also a place where everyone struggles to go unnoticed. In Kick Ass people don't have super powers there are no super heroes, but there are the bad guys the power hungry and the rest of us who ""just exist."" Kick Ass is masked by Hollywood clichés and gimmicks, but effective and dare I say subtly profound at it's core. ""How many people have ever wanted to have super powers?"" the narrator asks in the opening scene. There is something fun and awe-inspiring about the kill fest in the film based on the comic book series with the same moniker. Who doesn't want to beat up the bad guys? Matthew Vaugn didn't direct a movie attempting to just parody superhero movies. He made a movie in jest, to amuse, and espouse in us nostalgia, titillation and remind us of our own childhood wonder. Even Nicholas Cage is put to good use as Big Daddy; loving and dysfunctional Cage plays the vengeful vigilante father to his femme fatale of a daughter Hit Girl(Chloë Grace Moretz). And the lead role is believable and handled well by Adam Johnson who stars as our superhero Dave Lizewski—also known as Kick-Ass, the nerd turned vigilante avenger. <br/><br/>As the film progresses you get the joke, and the message. One of the best ""super hero"" movies I've ever seen. Predictable but pleasantly unexpected and entertaining."

","Dave is a loser with a nerdy comicy brain. No one knew him at his school and his friends are just a bunch of losers. One day he saw a guy being beat up by a bunch of thugs and decided to jump in a help with his superhero costume. The video was captured and became an internet phenomenon. Everyone tried to figure out who was this guy and named his Kick-Ass. Kick-Ass became a pop icon just in days. After hearing about Kick-Ass, hit men Big Daddy & Hit Girl decided to go after him to join him with their group. Going through lots of violence and profanity, Kick-Ass finally got that these two don't kid around. They kill mercilessly, they enjoy taking lives, and they cuss like a bunch of New Yorkers. Kick-Ass is a refreshingly new film that adds to the comic-action-films genre. Kudos to strong performances from crazyass Nicolas Cage and the fouled-mouth Chloe Moretz.

","When I picked up this movie from Redbox over the weekend, it wasn't my first choice. There were a lot of other movies out there that sparked my interest, but this was really the only one left that I had any interest to see. I am so happy I chose to watch this movie. I first thought this was going to be a funny, ad lib, joking around movie considering Mark Duke and Christopher Mintz-Plasse were in it. Then I started to watch, and become so engrossed in the sheer genius of how it all came together. I tell my friends this movie is from the perspective of ""What would happen if someone ACTUALLY put on a super hero costume and tried to fight crime?"" Not with all the fancy gadgets or super powers, but with everyday weapons. I was really impressed with all the cast, but especially Chloe Moretz. I mean, where did this girl come from?! Nicholas Cage and She did a wonderful job working together and really made the movie what it was. A kick ass action movie with lots of laughs and gruesome action scenes."

There are a lot of very depressing and horrific moments in this movie which is fine as long as you're not lying to people in your advertising and leading people to believe this is a light hearted comedy about teenage misfits fighting crime. There is nothing funny about this movie and in the end it's all about revenge, violence and a twelve year old girl dressed up like a common street whore arbitrarily murdering people. I've seen a few reviews where people have actually taken their children to see this movie.

","Saw this at an advanced screening today. Saw Kick Ass. It wasn't as good as I expected it to be but I expect it to be very popular. It is as good as the Hangover to comic book fans. Even if you don't like comic books it is pretty hilarious-- really hilarious. It is a tad bit vulgar but perfect for teens and young adults. Also, it is very similar to Tarantino and Taxi Driver, except more.. Hollywood. It's a bit different. Nic Cage is the same as ever. I didn't like Mintz-Plasse (McLovin) in this film, it wasn't quite his character. But I loved Hit Girl. It was like the director watched tons of comic book movies and tried to imitate the style but missed a bit as in there were moments when the film dragged. AMAZING fight scenes though like Repo Men.<br/><br/>I think Hit Girl will soon have a very big fan club though. I believe in Hit Girl. (:"

","In New York, the teenager Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) is a loser high-school student fan of comic books ignored in school that spends most of his time with his friends Marty (Clark Duke) and Todd (Evan Peters) that are also comic book fans. Dave has a great attraction by Katie Deauxma (Lyndsy Fonseca) that does not notice him. One day, the clumsy Dave decides to make the difference becoming a masked superhero without powers named Kick-Ass. However in his first action avoiding a car to be stolen by two punks, he is stabbed by one of them and hit by a car later. Dave is submitted to a surgery and his bones are mended with metal. When he recovers, Katie notices him believing that Dave is gay. In the night, Dave helps a man that is hunted down by three guys in front of a cafeteria and the teenagers shoot the fight with their cell phones and cameras. Then they put the footage in Internet and Kick-Ass immediately becomes famous. Meanwhile the powerful gangster Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong) believes that Kick-Ass is responsible for actions against his gang and plots a scheme to destroy him. However, the responsible are the vigilantes Hit-Girl and Big Daddy, whose secret identities are Damon Macready (Nicolas Cage) and his daughter Mindy (Chloe Moretz). Damon is an ex-cop that was framed by Frank D'Amico and sentenced to prison. He lost his beloved wife while imprisoned and trained his daughter in fights and weapons to combat crime, more specifically Frank. They start a partnership with Kick-Ass, but sooner the evil Frank and his son Chris (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) plot a plan to betray Kick-Ass.<br/><br/>""Kick-Ass"" is one of the funniest movies I have watched this year, exploring pop culture of comic books, superheroes and video-games associated with silliness to the best. The cartoonist characters are hilarious, with a douchebag that has his ass frequently kicked deciding to become a hero that kick asses; an eleven year-old girl that is a hit-woman (actually a hit-girl); a paranoid father that raises his daughter training her to kill bad guys; a beautiful girl that gets closer to the anti-hero Dave just because she believes he is gay. ""Kick-Ass"" is a great parody to Spider-man and I loved the reference ""with no power comes no responsibility"". Chloe Moretz performs one of the most refreshing and crazy characters with Hit-Girl that looks like Steven Seagal or any other action movie hero like Chuck Norris, Bruce Willis, Sylvester Stallone, Jet Li, Arnold Schwarzenegger or Dolph Lundgren expert in martial arts and weapons that easily kill the bad guys and is responsible for some of the best moments of this entertaining film. My vote is eight.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Kick-Ass: Quebrando Tudo"" (""Kick-Ass: Breaking Everything"")<br/><br/>Note: On 20 February 2016 I saw this film again."
"fullmetalanimator","8","4","8","28 August 2011"," Enjoyable piece of superhero satire and outrageous action.
","Cinema today has become over saturated enough as it is with superhero flicks, be it Marvel, DC or anything else less mainstream. So it's quiet refreshing that they're willing to bring more cult classics onto the big screen.<br/><br/>Kick-Ass is a sort of a self parody in someways as it seems to satire the whole superhero concept from beginning to end. The writer of the comics, Mark Millar, even said that the idea was based off of his own desire to be a superhero growing up in Scotland. It feels somewhat believable that a teenage looser might actually try this out someday resulting in this much mishap, for the first half of the film anyway since towards the end it gets more over-the-top. The writing is well thought out with a great sense of irony and humor, even really dark and brutally violent scenes will bring a devious grin to your face. Characters feel believable and are easy to connect with, especially Hit Girl who has to be one of the most interesting characters I've ever seen in cinema. It's hilarious how one critic accused the film makers for making this eleven-year-old girl 'sexulized' but then bawled when he was accused of pedophilia himself, as though he expected anything else! That little rant aside, Kick-Ass is a refreshing and amusing piece of work that should have you coming back for more. Roll on the sequel!"

"Conradical19","9","4","8","8 July 2011"," Lives up to it's name.
","Personally, I found this film to be incredibly enjoyable and I really don't mean that in a sadistic sense.<br/><br/>Firstly, the character, Kick-Ass (Aaron Johnson), is inspiring to me. He portrays a plausible teenage vigilante. He starts off very brave, tenacious, reasonable and truly heroic! I think my favourite scene is where he defends a victim from 3 thugs, in front of people and endures numerous hits (both physically and on Youtube). The scene works perfectly to the tune 'Omen' by The Prodigy and, in a way, the fight scene is an omen in the film.<br/><br/>The film is similar to 'Hot Fuzz' because it starts off realistically, set in a world of selfish people, corruption and apathetic witnesses and yet only one guy is desperately trying to do the right thing. However, all hell breaks loose and both films end in a ridiculous and violent crescendo. Kick-Ass very rightly says, ""I'm way in over my head!""<br/><br/>In contrast, Hit-Girl seems to be a character deliberately used to test the threshold for bad influence. The actress seemed far too young for the role. She even drops the C-bomb! She reminds me of Puss in Boots manipulating people by acting angelic then suddenly becoming a merciless but skillful assassin.<br/><br/>It's great to see Christopher Mintz-Plasse (Red Mist, McLovin etc.) in this role and a very different Mark Strong (Mob-boss Frank) compared to Vaughn's other brilliant film, 'Stardust'. I think this film is very well directed and I love the way the plot played with my expectations many times. That was thoroughly enthralling!<br/><br/>Also, I liked the intertextuality (film references) to other superhero movies like Spider-Man, X-Men and Nick Cage being similar to Batman.<br/><br/>I think a 15 rating is OK but slightly pushing it. There are a few torture scenes including a particularly unpleasant one towards the end. But the film is still brilliant and I'm looking forward to the sequel. Fortunately, the area I live in doesn't need a super-hero as it's relatively peaceful. But I believe Kick-Ass when he says, everyone's fantasized about being a superhero. I'm not ashamed to admit that I have. However, this film proves that you don't need to be a mutant to be a super-hero. You just need to be a good character."

"miciomiciobaobao","9","4","8","29 July 2010"," Great light movie
","I loved it.<br/><br/>All I knew before watching it was that it had something to do with normal people trying to be superheros (I usually try not to even watch the trailers so that they don't influence me and they don't make me expect more than what the movie has to offer).<br/><br/>I think about this movie as follows: take Watchmen, do a low-cgi-version out of it, mix to it a few pieces of American Pie, add how you would try to behave when being a superhero plus some bloody Tarantino-shots for one of the characters, contour the whole with some interesting music and you've got the movie.<br/><br/>It was like with Zombieland - in both cases I expected a quite bad movie, but in the end they were quite good, not serious, with a story that unfolded without any problems, nice camera shots, nice music, good actors, happy feeling at the end - a profiled movie. Not one of those that mix everything trying to be OK for every kind of public.<br/><br/>As I always doubt if the person who wrote the review has the same taste that I have, here are a few more or less recent movies I liked: Watchmen, The girl with the dragon tattoo, Let the right one in, Frost nixon, Zombieland, Children of men, Gone baby gone, Snatch. This of course excludes older ones, even classics like 2001 Space odyssey or Seven samurai.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage does his job - not more and not less. Chapeau. The little girl (Chloe Moretz) is great, probably the best character in the movie. The main actor (Aaron Johnson) was in my opinion flat. He could have been a bit better. The bad guy(s) fit well in their roles.<br/><br/>10 out of 10 would have been with a better main character and towards the end a badder bad character."
"MovieProductions","7","4","8","16 July 2010"," Kick Ass is the most fun you might have this year
","*** out of (****)<br/><br/>""Kick Ass"" is the Matthew Vaughn directed action packed extravaganza that's based off the comic book series and spun a lot of controversy. A majority of the top critics thought it was truly repugnant to see an eleven year old spew out f bombs, kick ass, and take names. And yes, most strict Christians have complained about the film due to its graphic nature and vile profanity. Even without the strong controversy, I know this sounds heavily clichéd, but Kick Ass, kicks, well... ass. It sure kicked mine. How can you not love a film that has strong performances, a great story, and just awe-inspiring cinematography? To regard Kick Ass as another comic book film is like calling Alone in the Dark a cinematic masterpiece. I can't believe how utterly satisfied I was with this movie. This is probably one of the most electrifying and great film experiences I've had. Is this film Citizen Kane? No, but it's such a great film on its own merits, that it doesn't even matter. <br/><br/>Kick Ass revolves around Dave (Johnson), who wonders what it would be like to be a superhero. So Dave decides to buy a heroic costume, scares off a group of street punks in the beginning of the film, and entitles himself ""Kick Ass"". Along the way, ""Kick Ass"" meets up with ""Hit Girl"" and ""Big Daddy"" who befriend him. However, the juvenile ""Red Mist"" is trying to take him down. <br/><br/>First off, the cinematography is absolutely breathtaking. The movie is so vibrant and rich with color, that it's like looking at an ancient art painting. The movie has so much texture and detail that it's almost like it jumps off the screen. Furthermore, the action is truly superb and is nothing short of awesome. Seriously folks, this is the best and most plausible action since ""The Matrix"". And yes, I went that far. Moreover, this movie has been talked about because of its graphic nature and doesn't disappoint in terms of gore. We get a human microwave explosion, a decapitated leg, a shot to the face, and several balls-to-the-wall action sequences. Additionally, the performances in this movie are simply terrific. Every character truly stands out, even the most insignificant of characters. Furthermore, the script is extremely fresh. The jokes pack a punch, the premise is fun, the subplots are great, and the movie's more drastic moments are simply tear-jerkers. Also, the pacing is fantastic. Scenes are paced pretty briskly and you will not be bored.<br/><br/>While the pros outweigh the cons, there are still some flaws, but they are extremely minimal, and minor. First off, I thought before Hit Girl was introduced, the film wasn't that great. Don't get me wrong, if Hit Girl wasn't in this movie, I'd give the movie a 5. It still was good, but things got a lot better when she kicked into gear. To add to that, I thought this movie could have been more fun. There were a little too many depressing moments, that would have made an otherwise non-stop fun escapist summer fare movie.<br/><br/>Overall, Kick Ass is one of the most fun films of the year. It simply is inclusive to the elements of a great movie: terrific acting, story, direction, gore, action, cinematography, and script. Its flaws are so minor and minimal, that they are so easy to overlook. Not to mention, it's just a whole lot of fun. Really, I don't think this movie could have been any better. It shows that Matthew Vaughn doesn't want to make a good movie. He wants to make a great movie and he succeeded. If only directors would be this passionate and ambitious about their movies, then we'd get more films like ""Kick Ass"". ""Kick Ass"" is one of those rare movies that's fun and well-crafted. Seek out a matinée."

"pontram","9","6","14","13 May 2010"," A funny lie
","In the first hour or so Kick-Ass was very funny for me. I realized that it is based on a Comic Book I read one year ago until Issue 4. And until issue 4 I liked the Comic Book, so I liked the movie until then and a little further.<br/><br/>The Idea to present a complete loser as a super hero, and how he would survive in the real world is very interesting, and it is also funny. Funny as a comedy about USA, about hypes and those virtual places of self-expression, about youth, violence, fighting, crime....<br/><br/>The jokes are not that intelligent, I admit it. But they are surprisingly ruthless, and sarcastic, so everyone can figure out that this is not a Hollywood production.<br/><br/>But it is obviously a major production, and it has to earn its major money. Like Mark Millars comic, which was, also obviously, made to make major money. The Comic is, maybe, a little deeper than the movie. Until the end of issue 4, where Hit-Girl appears with her katana, it is an interesting comic about a loser in a costume, who tries to escape his fate as a loser and also, tries to do something better, which is really honorable. After that, it's about earning money for the publishers and the Author. The Hit Girl Character is created for that reason (only). Same with the movie. And with this superhuman figure appearance every realism disappears and with realism also humor.<br/><br/>The movie evolves then from a lighthearted sarcastic comedy to a simple Hollywood brainless action flick, still funny for many (male) teens or adults (including myself !) because of the exaggerated action and situations. But it looses its dark humor, and that's a real tragedy.<br/><br/>A real shame is the loss of big Daddies confession in the Comic Book, he is only a loser who wanted to give his daughter and himself a more meaningful life, so he stole her from her mother and searched for a Villain he can battle against. No former Police Officer who was tricked by the big bad guy, no death of Hit Girl's mother. So the movie continues to lose any of those small amounts of intelligence and directly leads into mainstream action where it didn't necessarily have to - remember that it's self declared as innovative and fresh.<br/><br/>Because finishing the villain with the premise of having no real cause - personal revenge, which is not agreeable but understandable - but only for being someone or having a special life, or simply for a lie, that would you make think about how much it is worth to begin a war against someone you haven't anything to do with; that's what Miller wanted to express with his little twist in his story. In that context the pride of Big Daddy about Hit Girl gets a new meaning, also.<br/><br/>As long as Kick-Ass is a nerd, a loser, an idiot, he is a real superhero. We can identify ourselves with him when we imagine how we would act wearing his costume, except we are someone like Bas Rutten. But Big Daddy is a lunatic who abuses his daughter as a child-soldier for his perverted ideas, and when this is carried out in the Book, those funny killings and shootouts get some bitter after-taste. This is a major aspect, peculated in the movie for commercial reasons. Nevertheless, in real life people do not suffer because of their mass murderers if they don't get caught by law.<br/><br/>However, a remarkable scene is when Hit-Girl rescues Kick-Ass in the warehouse. She uses night vision, and where the Comic Book gives this scene only a few pictures of killing two or three bad guys, the movie creates an impressive ego-shooter-like battle lasting several minutes. I'm not sure what the creators wanted to say with this, but it was funny and disturbing the same time. I think it's the first time that a gaming sight was brought into life in a movie, except in ""Gamer"", where the realization of the combats cannot measure up to this. I recommend gaming fans to watch the movie only for this scene.<br/><br/>Overall, the acting is a bit wooden, and Kick Ass himself is not believable as loser, because he is simply too good looking. N.C. as Big Daddy is not on top of N.C. intensity, maybe because he's behind a mustache or a mask. The most convincing acting is - now I may disagree with all of you - by Mark Strong as Frank. Surely Chloe Moretz is fascinating, but I know that this is also a big matter of cut, camera and timing, so if she steals the show, its what the director intended.<br/><br/>At last I must disagree that this movie is in any way comparable with Spy Kids. This would be like comparing Fritz the Cat to Aristocats. And any comparison with Kill Bill is a real insult for Kill Bill. If you want to compare Prison Break with Down By Law, just do so...<br/><br/>Edit: After watching Kick-Ass again I rated it from 6 to 8 because of perfect choreography and - despite the changes mentioned above - making an unforgettable experience from a more or less unimpressive source."
"jaymeetee","8","5","11","15 August 2010"," Super Lock Stock and Three Smokin Batmans
","Dave Lizewski is a comic reading, invisible to girls, High School geek. Who has a dream to become a superhero, although there is one problem...he has no revenge mission, super powers or training...but he does have a scuba suit! He embarks on a mission to help fight crime as the superhero Kick Ass and in one night, as a civilian films him fighting a gang of criminals, he becomes an internet phenomenon. This prompts the world to take notice, including other superheroes Hit Girl and Big Daddy and the evil gangster Frank D'Amico and his son who realises the benefits of creating an alter ego.<br/><br/>This is an excellent film jam packed with energy, jokes, action and great dialogue. The film starts out as a teen comedy in the vein of Superbad but quickly goes darker. Director Matthew Vaughn's history has been in gritty English gangster movies and this really shows through in the middle of the film. Genuinely nasty characters doing nasty things could quite easily be at home in Snatch or Layer Cake, make up the baddies for our superheroes to battle against. As soon as we are introduced to Hit Girl (an 11 year old knife wielding little ninja), her father Big Daddy (a betrayed ex cop looking for revenge) and Red Mist (the baddie alter ego of Frank D'Amico's son) you really start to feel you are watching a superhero movie. There are some great comic book references and they really help to remind you this is a superhero movie as at some parts the action is good enough to be a stand alone gangster flick and the jokes good enough for any comedy.<br/><br/>Aaron Johnson is great as Kick Ass as he is geeky enough to warm to but edgy enough to be credible, Christopher Mintz-Plasse fresh from McLovin in Superbad is also great as Red Mist and Nicholas Cage is understated and as he plays the revengeful Big Daddy. But the show is stolen by Chloe Moretz as she plays the truly brilliant Hit Girl. I don't think many non animation films have featured such a young assassin and she certainly takes centre stage and is played brilliantly.<br/><br/>The film crosses three genres of teen comedy, gangster movie and comic book superhero, a sort of 'Super Lock Stock and Three Smoking Batmans' if you like. I'll give you one bit of advice, you need to watch this film, it's cool, energetic and really slick. I can't wait for the sequel planned in 2012."
"jlt86","8","5","11","13 August 2010"," Much Better Than What I Thought it Would Be
","At first, when I saw the previews for Kick Ass, it didn't really look all that interesting...until I saw why it received an R rating. This movie was SO much better than what I thought it would be. The important thing to keep in mind is, don't take it TOO seriously and don't take it TOO personally. People complain about 11 year old Hit Girl having a filthy mouth, a high body count, and bloody murderous fight scenes...but seriously people, GET OVER IT. You see what it's rated R for so it goes without saying that Kick Ass is not for everyone...particularly those that get sick at the sight of blood. If you think a movie is going to be offensive to you...don't watch it...and therefore you won't have to bitch about it later.<br/><br/>Kick Ass is bloody good fun, stylish, fast paced and not for the feint of heart. If you're not easily offended (or have a stick wedged up your ass) you're in for a good time."

","I love this film. I can see why some parents are going crazy about the content, but frankly, if a parent has done his/her job, some superhero/comic book movie can't jade the kiddies as badly as folks are saying this one will. Get over yourselves, and enjoy the film for the care-free fun flick it is.<br/><br/>Slick production style, relatively low budget, with high quality action sequences, and some awesome characterizations make for some really great movie moments. Although this stars one of the kiddies, this movie may not be appropriate for all ages. The starlet uses some horrible language and perpetrates some horrible actions, but the film is richer for it.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage's role is below tertiary, but it is wholly enjoyable seeing him in this endeavor. As usual, he contributes a beautiful aspect to the story's emotionality.<br/><br/>All in all? It's suitable for Friday/Saturday night viewing as long as your bff/gf isn't the churchy type.<br/><br/>It rates an 8.2/10 from...<br/><br/>the Fiend :."
"labrujitarosa","9","5","11","30 May 2010"," A rare occasion of a film living up to its name in a good way. Kick-Ass is the most fun you'll have at the cinema in 2010 - –you'll want to watch it again and again.
","Kick-Ass is the best film you will see this year – a lofty claim with not even half of the year under our collective belts, I know, but it has already blown everything else in 2010 out of the water. Don't read this review – go see it now. But if you need convincing, then read on.<br/><br/>What if superheroes were real? Or, more accurately, what if ordinary people were so inspired by fictional heroes that they decided to become ones themselves? After all, as narrator and protagonist Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) points out, villains are certainly real enough.<br/><br/>Dave, a 17-year-old New Yorker, is the poster boy for mundane. He claims his only superpower is being invisible to girls, especially long-term crush Katie Deauxma (Lyndsey Fonseca) and that he's not even the funny one among his friends. He's an easy target for muggers and bullies, and hates how no one seems willing to stand up for anyone else.<br/><br/>After one injustice too many, he decides its time to take action, and sets about turning himself into a superhero, with the aid of eBay and MySpace, dubbing himself the optimistic Kick-Ass. But it's YouTube that really does the trick, when a video of an unexpected victory goes viral and propels him into the hearts and minds of disillusioned New Yorkers. While Dave has just a handful of MySpace friends, Kick-Ass has 16,000 and counting.<br/><br/>Unbeknown to the budding superhero, however, there's a more dangerous game being played, between crime lord Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong) and father-daughter vigilante duo, Big Daddy (Nicholas Cage) and Hit Girl (Chloe Grace Moretz). When one of Kick-Ass' deeds lands him in the middle of the real action, he has to decide whether to give up his one-man quest for justice or join he big ""boys"".<br/><br/>Kick-Ass is like so many films, yet entirely original. Dave and pals Marty (Clark Duke) and Cody (Dexter Fletcher) – and their quest for girls out of their league – wouldn't be out of place in Superbad. The makeshift costuming is reminiscent of Mystery Men. A number of conversations could have been inserted into Pulp Fiction. But it all comes together smoothly and inventively, adding up to an emotional roller-coaster – hilarious, thrilling, tense, romantic and exuberant, sometimes all at once.<br/><br/>Set in a real city with realistic characters, the film walks a fine line between plausibility and outlandishness – but it pulls it off as skilfully as a Cirque de Soleil acrobat on a tightrope. It earns its jaw-dropping moments, from a return from death to a superhero flying as high as a skyscraper.<br/><br/>This is mostly thanks to the fresh writing and fast pacing – and the surprisingly spot-on casting. I was doubtful the dreamy Johnson could be the geek Dave was meant to be – it seemed as if they were going to remove his glasses to reveal Superman perfection at some point. But I needn't have worried – Johnson has excellent comic timing and immense likability. The glasses do come off, but Dave stays true to his trajectory, becoming heroic in a believable way.<br/><br/>Furthermore, Johnson's nasal narration enhances the film, as he delivers self-deprecating observations and clever pop cultural nods – at one point he reminds the audience not to be so confident about his fate, as narrators can talk from beyond the grave, as in Sin City and American Beauty.<br/><br/>Even Strong (last seen in Robin Hood) as yet another villain won me over and Cage was on good form, allowing the spotlight to focus on his younger co-stars. After her sparkly turn in Hot Tub Time Machine, Fonseca again proves herself to be an entertaining love interest, while Christopher Mintz-Plasse, as Frank's wannabe ganger son, proves an ideal foil for Kick-Ass.<br/><br/>But the true star of the show is Moretz, to whom I award the title of Least Annoying Child Star Ever. Hit Girl is what you would get Kill Bill's The Bride raised Leon's Matilda. I foresee little (and big) girls dressing up in purple wigs and kilts for Halloween. Hopefully they'll forgo the switch-blades.<br/><br/>Besides Hit Girl's profanity, the gore is likely to incite the most controversy. One especially gruesome incident involves a man in an industrial microwave, and the body count is through the roof. Still, it doesn't feel unnecessary – the violence either serves to heighten tension or has artistic merit.<br/><br/>In fact, Kick-Ass does much to de-glamorize violence. Dave, as Big Daddy observes, might have done better to name himself Ass-Kick, as he's often the one being beaten. The characters feel real enough that when they are attacked, it's truly visceral and horrible – their bruises and aches don't disappear with the next scene. And the issue of Hit Girl being raised as a fighter is intelligently addressed.<br/><br/>Among the film's other highlights are the energetic soundtrack – Mika, The Prodigy and Gnarls Barkley feature – and incorporation of comic book graphics, especially in one stunning sequence that explains Big Daddy's back-story, again tying the fantastic back into reality.<br/><br/>What the film succeeds most in, though, is its thoughtful exploration of what means to be a hero. The answer may surprise you – especially as the answer won't be the same for every viewer."
"Generic_Gooner","9","9","24","6 April 2010"," Believe the hype, Kick-Ass delivers!
","I wanted to like it... i really did.<br/><br/>And you know what, i loved it! <br/><br/>Opening scene although ruined as an opening joke by one of the trailers sets the tone for such bad taste comedy, its like the politically correct world we live in now never noticed this slip into cinemas! Hit Girl is the unintentional (or intentional you might say given the lines she has and her role in the plot) star of the film, but the beauty of it really is how they manage to keep the focus on kick ass. And although some may disagree i felt he was a likable character who i was really rooting for all the way.<br/><br/>Cage as Big Daddy was a tad underused given the brilliance of the character (Cage back to his very best), his choice of voice for his superhero persona seemed lost on the rest of the audience around me as i began chuckling on my own! :P But he managed to play the comedy so deadpan that when the switch back and forth between heartwarming/emotive and comic book comedy occurs, you don't feel like its jerky or uneven.<br/><br/>Hit Girl has all the best lines, and the actress who plays her (Chloe Moretz) does such a fantastic job its like she isn't actually only a child. A great future ahead of that one i think.<br/><br/>Christopher Mintz-Plasse as Chris D'Amico is an additional comedy turn in a film which is already brimming with them, but along with Mark Strong (who is in EVERYTHING right now it seems) make two 'interesting' villains.<br/><br/>But its all about Aaron Johnson as Dave/Kick-Ass, and the juxtaposition between the polished fighting styles of the likes of Hit Girl, and Kick-Ass/Red Mist's more 'amateur' efforts are what gives this film its character.<br/><br/>Its over the top cartoon violence, with comedy placed strategically around a plot that although might seem familiar and routine, is so full of nice little touches it just didn't matter.<br/><br/>There will be plenty for those who wish to gripe about it to pick on, it is a walking controversy. But this is the comic book it's adapted from, with a few alterations that to me seem to improve on the story and make it more endearing (strange word for a film like this i know, but its true).<br/><br/>To pigeon hole this into a genre beyond 'comic book adaptation' is impossible, as its got comedy, action, violence bordering on horror, and emotive moments of almost touching drama. It has a bit of everything, woven into a neat little parcel that never seems to waste a moment and revels in the fun of it all.<br/><br/>A must see."

","Kick Ass came out of nowhere and stunned the critics as well as the public alike. It is probably as anti-superhero as one can get and it is visceral- which is something you do not see in risk averse big budget superhero films. Nicholas Cage is a worthy guru to Aaron Taylor and his sidekick- the ass kicking Chloe Moretz. Do not go in with any expectation and you will be pleasantly surprised. A special mention to the cinematography and fights department who really shine through. 7/10 (You want an original superhero film- you got one here)."
"walentys","4","2","3","29 August 2018"," Just another superhero movie
","Oh, excellent, a foray into superheroes once again, but this time let's give it a comedic spin. Also let's keep it ""realistic"" and ACKNOWLEDGE the fact that superheroes are a ridiculous idea. That will make it original.<br/><br/>Except it just makes it another frickin' superhero movie at the end of the day.<br/><br/>The movie is about a teenage boy so obsessed with comic books and superheroes that he simply tries to become one by donning a costume, dubbing himself ""Kick-Ass"", and trying to fight bad guys on the street. The angle it tried to go for from this initial setup was to show how a ""real"" superhero attempt would go down. It mildly succeeds in the beginning, showing our protagonist getting his ass kicked when trying to be a hero. I was hoping it would continue with this angle, but I just knew it wouldn't. Eventually it degrades into your average superhero flick when ""real"" superheroes (Nic Cage and his character's daughter) come in to save Kick-Ass. There's nothing actually supernatural about these ""real"" superheroes, just an unrealistic amount of fighting skill.<br/><br/>It is precisely at this point, about 40 minutes in, that the film flushes away all potential. It was literally set up, and marketed, as a real attempt at being a superhero and to show how bad of an idea the whole thing is, all with a comedic spin. This may have actually worked, but instead there ARE actual superheroes who waste insane amounts of baddies and do things superheroes generally do. I believe there was plenty of comedic potential in the initial premise, but the inclusion of these ""actual superheroes"" literally defeats the entire purpose of the film. It made me ask myself: What the hell am I now watching? Perhaps this was done intentionally, comedically, like ""we are a comic book movie so we ultimately have to be a comic book movie"", but then that just begs the question: Why not just be a comic book movie? Why even include this whole beginning with the ""reality behind superheroes and why there are none in real life"" angle? The only thing I can come up with is fresh marketability. But it certainly did not lead to fresh filmmaking or content. Also for this kind of movie it was way too long, clocking in at a full 2 hours.<br/><br/>Despite the film's lack of any good substance, it still gives a few laughs, mostly on the behalf of Nicolas Cage's intentional overacting. Also the intro was quite funny in a tasteless fashion: it showed a kid with a superhero costume and cape jumping off a tall building, expecting to fly, but instead just landing to his death on a taxi cab.<br/><br/>But overall, other than a few cheap laughs and some decent fighting, this was not a very good film and doesn't really stand out as anything original despite the potential it may have had in the beginning. I merely pray they don't make a sequel, but I have a strong feeling they will due to the way it ended."

","This superhero-ish movie was such a breath of fresh air. Not that I'm at all tired with the DC comics and Marvel productions because they are fantastic, it's just that I didn't want to be inundated with yet another superhero with the same talents but different than all the rest. Kick-Ass' most impressive talents were his ability to not feel pain during severe beatings.<br/><br/>Kick-Ass was both humorous and exciting. I know that Dave Lizewski/Kick-Ass (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) was the star, but as far as I'm concerned, he can take a back seat for Hit-Girl (Chloe Grace Moretz). She made the movie. Without her it would have been a mildly funny action flick. With her it became a mildly funny action flick with some good action. How can you resist a gun wielding 12 year old that can take out an entire mob?"
"PopCulturedwithMovieMike","9","2","3","29 January 2014"," A bloody good time.
","Kick-Ass is crude, gratuitously violent, over-the-top and I loved every minute of it. <br/><br/>Kick-Ass is not for everybody. The violence and some of the language might be too much for some people to handle, especially when it comes from the pint sized punisher Hit-Girl, played by Chloe Moretz. <br/><br/>The story isn't original, but the characters are interesting enough to make the film feel fresh. Aaron Johnson plays a teen who doesn't understand why more people don't try to be superheroes. He soon transforms himself into a masked crusader named Kick-Ass. With little more than good intentions and a pair of batons, he takes to the streets to do justice. <br/><br/>It's not long before Kick-Ass gets his ass kicked. This doesn't stop him from being a superhero. He is later videotaped saving a man who is being beaten up by 3 thugs. The video becomes hugely popular and Kick-Ass is born. <br/><br/>No superhero can save the world alone and that's when he meets Big Daddy (Nick Cage) and Hit-Girl. This is when the film really starts rolling. <br/><br/>Big Daddy and Hit-Girl might be the most interesting father/daughter duo to ever grace a movie screen. While most little girls are interested in Barbie dolls, Hit-Girl is interested in butterfly knives. Sugar and spice and everything nice she is not. More like glocks and knives and everything dies. <br/><br/>Hit-Girl is easily the best film heroine since Uma Thurman in Kill Bill. The things she does and says is so over-the-top, it can't help but be entertaining. Let's not forget, it's just a movie. <br/><br/>Kick-Ass is not your ordinary superhero flick. It's not a film for the faint of heart and it's definitely not a film for kids. If you like your films with a high level of action and violence, then Kick-Ass is tailor made for you."

Just when you think you know what's going to happen next, something unexpected happens. This is one of the secrets of this movie's success. I can only imagine whoever brainstormed this movie had a lot of fun dreaming up the sequences, avoiding predictable scenarios and injecting style and surprises.<br/><br/>The kid who plays Kick-Ass does a great job at being a ""regular kid"", while his friends are very good supporting.<br/><br/>I have watched this movie three times now, and each time I sit there with a big smile on my face.<br/><br/>Soundtrack is good too, with a driving tension-building theme that goes well with the action.<br/><br/>This movie is why I love movies. 9/10"

","I won't get into the story here because it's abundantly covered pretty much everywhere else. So anyway, on to my opinion...<br/><br/>Making a serious/silly genre film that firmly sits on the edge isn't easy. More so when the whole film revolves around this concept and thumbs its nose at superhero conventions (in a friendly way though).<br/><br/>Kick-Ass manages this rare balance act and more, with a few cult scenes, a brilliant cast, fine styling, good cinematography, good music, a script that works, and it even has its share of quotable one liners (assuming you're a homicidal superhero).<br/><br/>All in all it's a brilliant film that works for most segments of the public. It's at once a superhero film and a comedy, an adventure film and an action flick... the only people that might be put off will be a segment of the US public because of the abundant swearing, a lot of it uttered by a kid girl (which just makes it more fun for the rest of us).<br/><br/>Remember that if you need them, the mayor has a special signal... http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1250777/trivia?tab=qt&item=qt1120995"

","Kick-Ass is a brilliant movie with a very well developed storyline and a fantastic cast. It's a very funny movie from start to finish, a great take on superhero movies, it isn't necessarily a parody, but more like a loving tribute, Matthew Vaughn's unique directing style is evident throughout and I don't think anyone could have done a better job than him, his technique suits the tone and wit of these comics, and he brings this world to life perfectly. The cast is superb and they all do a great job of portraying these characters, but I felt like some characters could have been developed more, obviously Kick-Ass is the most important character, but I felt like the movie didn't necessarily need to focus on him as much as it did, I would have loved to have seen more origins for Big Daddy, who was brilliantly portrayed by the very hit and miss Nicolas Cage, and more scenes for Frank D'Amico, the main villain superbly played by Mark Strong, would have been great. Even with all the comedy and action that is evident throughout, the film manages to never forget heart, we genuinely care for these characters and the journey they are on, movies like this normally forget to do that, we feel care for them and there are even some emotional moments that surprised me with how much sympathy I truly felt. Action packed, funny and topped off with a superb cast, I would recommend Kick-Ass to anyone looking for a good comedy or action. <br/><br/>A boy with no skills or powers decides to become a superhero, making him a very wanted man by some dangerous men. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Chloë Grace Moretz Worst Performance: Jason Flemyng"

","Kick-Ass is bloody, funny, original, and everything you could want in an action-comedy. Aaron Johnson plays Dave, a high school loser who decides to become a superhero, aka Kick-Ass. Aaron Johnson had a terrific performance and really nailed the character. He was nerdy and just a loser in general, and was so funny when he was using his little batons. The other standout performance was by Chloe Moretz, who plays the foul- mouthed Hit-Girl. Her father, aka Big-Daddy played by Nicholas Cage, has been training her to shoot guns, use crazy knife weapons, and just kill people. Chloe Moretz is definitely a young actress to keep an eye on; I read that she went to circus school to train for her role. Overall, this movie is fresh with some awesome action scenes that will make you wanting more. If there is a part 2, you can bet that I will be first in line to see it."
"Altrious","8","8","21","22 April 2010"," Loved it
","I won't go as far to say this is the best movie of all time. But, after seeing the garbage that was Clash of the Titans before this in theaters, it feels like it could be considered the best. But, that's a different movie, so, different review. I did enjoy this movie thoroughly. Of course it had its downsides, but what movie doesn't? I see so many complaints about Chloe as Hit-Girl, and all I can do is praise her. Children tend to ruin movies for me, but, this was not that case. This movie was brilliant because of her. The amount of seriousness mixed with childishness was hilarious and entertaining as hell. <br/><br/>Nicholas Cage, I will honestly say, every movie I have ever seen him in, I have no enjoyed. Movies such as, Ghost Rider, National Treasure, The Wicker Man, all these movies made me want to cry. But, in Kick Ass, I couldn't help but love him. He felt so cheesy and dumb, but, that's the kind of movie this is. He was a stereotype that people have seem to have forgotten, and he played it beautifully and he had me laughing whenever he was on screen. And not to mention, his action scene was pretty bad ass. <br/><br/>Christopher Mintz-Plasse, I'm not a huge fan of. Superbad was a rather awful movie, and he didn't make me go crazy in this film. Something about this guy just makes me hate, it's probably his voice, and the goofy look that is ever present on his face. He could have easily been left out of this movie for all I cared.<br/><br/>Aaron Johnson I think I will look forward to in the future. I liked the way he did the roll in this, his voice got a bit old and he seemed to be trying far to hard to have a geeky attitude, when we knew it was there. Overall, I enjoyed the hell out of this movie. It was funny, the action was good, and the story wasn't God awful. It didn't take itself too seriously, but when it did, it did it well."
"RichardSRussell-1","8","8","21","15 April 2010"," An Amazing Balancing Act
","Kick-Ass (1:58, R) — Fantasy: Comics & Pulps, 2nd string, crossover<br/><br/>The producers of Kick-Ass have a particular audience in mind — genus Fanboius, species komicbukii — and since I am a prime specimen of their intended target, I am pleased to say that they got me dead center with both barrels ... and also several knives, a stun gun, a few grenades, several well placed fists to the head and kicks to the groin, and a bazooka.<br/><br/>This flick is a total trip from beginning to end. It gets the comic-book feel just right, doesn't wuss out by pulling any punches in the brutality department, is extremely well paced, keeps you guessing as to where it's going (a plus in my book), and features snappy, realistic dialog. Plus which, it's got more than its fair share of laff-out-loud moments.<br/><br/>We open with a voice-over from average high-schooler Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson), musing ""I always wondered why nobody ever did it before me."" as we see a cloaked figure spread his costume wings and plummet from the top of a tall building as the citizens below gape up in awe. Up to that point, Dave has been one of the faceless masses, lamenting ""My only superpower was being invisible to girls."".<br/><br/>That's about to change, tho, as he decides he doesn't need superpowers to don a costume (a customized scuba wetsuit) and fight crime with only his bare hands, a brace of martial-arts batons, a taser, and ""a perfect combination of optimism and naiveté"". His 1st encounter in the heroic persona of Kick-Ass does not turn out well, however. But after they get done patching him back together, he's got lots of metal parts and enuf nerve damage to render him largely indifferent to pain. Thus his next big fight, defending a mugging victim against 3 thugs, works out somewhat better, tho he still takes a beating. But this time it's been captured on multiple cell-phone cameras and soon becomes an internet sensation.<br/><br/>As it turns out, somebody else DID hit on this idea before Dave did, somebody who does a much better Batman imitation while leaving virtually no traces of who he is. That would be ex-con (and framed ex-cop) Damon Macready (Nicolas Cage, even quirkier than usual but highly effective as such), who goes by the nom de guerre Big Daddy. Oh, yeah, and then there's Big Daddy's little girl (literally a girl, about age 11) Mindy (Chloe Moretz), AKA Hit- Girl, who's quicker than a cobra, nimbler than an Olympic gymnast, less remorseful than a pit bull, and cuter than a litter of cocker spaniel puppies when she wants to be.<br/><br/>Crime lord Frank D'Amico (the scarily effective Mark Strong) knows that somebody's been knocking over his drug deals and taking out his goons, but he doesn't believe the screaming pleas of his soon-to-be-ex henchmen that it was some kind of costumed vigilante. At least, he doesn't give it much credence until he sees the video of Kick-Ass, after which he figures he's identified his nemesis and orders his entire mob to track down and kill the costumed idiot.<br/><br/>He's wrong, of course, it's been BD and HG (to quote their belt buckles) all along. However bold his attitude, Dave is still physically ineffectual (tho his love life is perking up a bit), but now he's a target. BD and HG effortlessly track him down, warn him how easy it was and what he's up against, and offer help if he really needs it.<br/><br/>Shortly thereafter, another offer of assistance comes from a new costumed crime-fighter, Red Mist (Christopher Mintz-Plasse, trying hard to overcome the McLovin stereotype), but there's something a little hinky going on here.<br/><br/>This movie is rated R and deserves it. It has no campy bam-biff-pow scenes, but there are blood, cruelty, and corpses galore. The crooks are played as total hard-asses. And yet there are funny scenes that don't cut the mood. Really, this is an amazing balancing act, but nobody ever steps off that thin little wire.<br/><br/>It's clearly not a movie for everyone, but I thot it rocked, and what you get is my highly personal but totally honest opinion: dandy!"
"MGPT80","8","1","1","30 April 2020"," A sorely misunderstood masterpiece
","I am somewhat puzzled by all the negative reviews that Kick-Ass has received. I may be completely misinterpreting this movie, but as far as I can see, this is a tongue-in-cheek and refreshingly self-effacing piece of cinema. There is a gentle but respectful mocking of both the comic-book and action movie genres as well as an astute commentary on the gratuitous violence so prevalent in modern films. Or maybe I'm wrong and it's just an indulgent infantile fantasy story with zero taste or subtlety.<br/><br/>Kick-Ass would rank as one of the most original and well-executed comedies of recent years, featuring an excellent cast and some brilliant one-liners. Chloe Grace Moretz is a show-stopper but Aaron Taylor-Johnson also gives a great performance with a perfect blend of nerdiness, courage and reticence. There have been very few films in recent years with this balance of excitement, ingenuity and self-awareness."

"georgesakerman","10","1","1","16 August 2016"," Matthew Vaughn's bold, bravura adaptation kicks ass
","In a golden age of superhero movies, new is in short demand. Produced on a slim budget, peppered with awesome sight gags, featuring a blistering soundtrack and incredibly gory violence, Kick-Ass is new. Layer Cake director Matthew Vaughn teams once more with Stardust scribe Jane Goldman for a sporadically entertaining romp.<br/><br/>Newcomer Aaron Johnson stars as our hero and high-school dweeb Dave Lizewski. Dave isn't a normal teen though, as he fights crime in his spare time, as the eponymous Kick- Ass. But battling crime kingpin Frank D'Amico wasn't supposed to be on the cards for our young hero, and soon he's way out of his league. At this point in the movie, violence and profanity are being thrown around without question - but even this irresistible subversity is pedestrian to the horrors that are awaiting the audience. And the long, long list of horrors begin with Chloë Grace-Moretz's 11 year old pocket-rocket Hit-Girl. Her arrival heralds a small glimpse of the original and sensational career Matthew Vaughn has in front of him. The scene pits Kick-Ass and Hit-Girl against a small group of mercenaries in a manic battle to the death inside an apartment. What ensues has to be one of the most bloody, bruising, bonkers scenes ever committed to the silver screen. Scored shrewdly to Banana Splits (The Tra La La Song), Moretz hacks, slices and chops everyone in that apartment.<br/><br/>But the real magic of Kick-Ass is that the same madcap, bombastic brilliance is served upon you time and time again - most notably in the fiery, bazooka-filled finale. Kick-Ass really works under the mirth though, with Nicholas Cage and Moretz's father and daughter double act winning over cynics. Brimming with gore, grime and perfectly tuned black comedy, Kick-Ass is a blast."
"nat_power","7","1","1","15 June 2016"," ""I cant fly, but I can kick your ass""
","Using his love for comics as inspiration, teenager Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) decides to reinvent himself as a superhero -- despite a complete lack of special powers. Dave dons a costume, dubs himself ""Kick-Ass,"" and gets to work fighting crime. He joins forces with the father/daughter vigilante team of Big Daddy and Hit Girl, then befriends another fledgling crime-fighter called Red Mist (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), but a scheming mobster soon puts their alliance to the test.<br/><br/>""I can't fly, but I can kick your ass"". One of the my favorite superhero movies of all time, and mostly for the reason that the heroes aren't actually ""super"". I'm so tired of movies about Heros with actual superpowers or high tech robot suits. Matthew Vaughn is a genius when it comes to fighting sequences. The movie has a good story, characters, and the action is simply superb. Easily Cage's best role in years as Big Daddy, he was the highlight of the movie for me."
"hall895","7","1","1","4 February 2016"," Hit Girl kicks...well, you know
","If the idea of a foul-mouthed 11-year-old girl slaughtering people is just too repugnant for you then do not watch Kick-Ass. If you are willing to accept such an idea then there is much for you to enjoy in this movie. This movie is gleefully over-the-top in every way. And it makes for a rollicking good time. The movie has great wit, action and, surprisingly for a movie which is absolutely drowning in blood, charm. But make no mistake, for all the movie has going for it the best thing it has to offer is that pint-sized, potty-mouthed terror, Hit Girl.<br/><br/>But before we get to Hit Girl a word about Kick-Ass since the movie is after all entitled Kick-Ass. Aaron Johnson plays Dave Lizewski, an ordinary, anonymous teenager who decides to become a real-life superhero. He buys himself a cheesy costume, christens himself Kick-Ass and takes to the streets to save the day. And proceeds to get his ass kicked. But soon enough he manages to become an internet sensation...who's still getting his ass kicked. Enter Hit Girl. Begin the slaughter. She's got a costume but, unlike Kick-Ass, she's also got skills. And no qualms about hacking off a bad guy's limbs. She's been trained by her father who dresses like Batman and calls himself Big Daddy. This is one deadly duo. They're going to team up with Kick-Ass who, all things considered, might want to go back to being plain old Dave Lizewski.<br/><br/>There is much to like about the movie. It's funny, it's exciting, at times downright exhilarating. Not everything works perfectly. A subplot where Dave's dream girl, Katie, suddenly becomes interested in him because she mistakenly thinks he's gay doesn't add much to the proceedings. Mafia boss Frank D'Amico, the main villain for most of the film, is not the most exciting of antagonists. A movie this far out there (and boy is this movie far out there) needs a more compelling adversary for our heroes. Happily Red Mist enters the fray. Yes, another weirdo in a costume.<br/><br/>The one flaw with the film which is most clear is that the central character is nowhere near as interesting as the supporting players. Johnson gives a reasonably fine performance as Dave/Kick-Ass but the character is a little flat. Happily Hit Girl is here to liven things up. This girl is dynamite and Chloë Grace Moretz plays the part perfectly. A star-making performance. Moretz looks every bit the action star and is utterly convincing with the dialogue (including the raunchy stuff) and emotional scenes as well. And Moretz works beautifully with Nicolas Cage, playing Big Daddy. Cage decided to go way, way over-the-top with his performance and in this movie that works perfectly. He hams it up and he should be hamming it up, it's that kind of movie. Christopher Mintz-Plasse brings a very unique personality to Red Mist and, though her character seems a bit extraneous, Lyndsy Fonseca plays the part of Katie well. This is a pretty good movie up to the point we first see Hit Girl in action. From there the movie kicks into a higher gear and never lets up. Embrace the violence, enjoy the carnage, cheer on Hit Girl, one of the unlikeliest heroes you'll ever see. She kicks ass."
"SquigglyCrunch","8","1","1","23 September 2015"," One of the Best Superhero Movies Out There
","I didn't expect a whole lot from this movie, nor had I heard a heck of a lot about it. It looked like fun, so I decided to check it out. <br/><br/>This is easily one of the best, if not the best, superhero movie out there. <br/><br/>Kick-Ass is creative. Yeah sure, unlikely hero idea has been used, but the way this movie carries it out makes it feel much more original. It doesn't use the typical Hollywood movie formula which makes it stray from the unoriginality of other movies. It never takes anything too seriously, and when you think you know what's going to happen (thanks to our lovely formula), you quickly realize you don't. That doesn't mean it's completely unpredictable, but it switches it up enough to keep you interested. <br/><br/>The movie is hilarious. Enough said. <br/><br/>The movie actually makes you care about the characters. It's not just aimless action and humor, you actually care about the well- being of who's carrying you through this 117 minute epic, which is something modern movies often lack. It does something similar to Edgar Wright's 'Cornetto' trilogy (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, The World's End) in that it develops the characters through humor. And it actually works really well. I wanted to see the characters succeed, over being neutral about it which often happens these days. <br/><br/>Overall, Kick-Ass is great. It's original, funny, and inventive with well-developed characters. Maybe I'm comparing it too much to modern superhero movies which makes this one seem that much better, but either way, check it out. It'll definitely be worth your time."
"Vartiainen","Null","1","1","29 January 2014"," Clever superhero parody
","A film that teeters just at the edge of parody and satire. Its take on superheroes, both real-life and fictional, is both dark and twisted, empowering and admiring. Throughout the first act you feel like the film could have gone either way, either openly mocking the very idea of someone becoming an actual superhero, costume and all, or allowing some room for the coolness of the idea. In the end their selected route is the one that allows for some really satisfying action scenes and a lot of innate awesomeness, but some wicked part of me still wishes for more scenes like the opening one where a man tries out his wings for the first time. Perfect opening and mood setter for the whole ordeal.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, what we end up getting is one of the better comedy films I've seen in a long time. Yet it still is a workable action film, but with a great sense of humour. The weirdness of the situation is never denied and there are many pauses where even the characters take a break and just look at one another wondering: ""Just what are we doing, man?"" But, as stated, it's also a rather dark film, which is reflected in the storyline and some of the twists. Sometimes this dichotomy leads to some rather jarring mood whiplashes, but for the most part it works surprisingly well. The film makers have paced the film well. When it needs to be serious, you believe in its vision, and when it needs to be funny, you'll find yourself laughing, even while admiring the brutality of its action scenes.<br/><br/>In the end I found myself liking this film. It's a strong movie character-wise, the action scenes are very effective and it's a genuinely funny film. The story lacks that razor sharpness that would have propelled this into an instant classic, but it's by no means bad. I mostly blame the indecisiveness of the mood for this. Still, easily worth checking out if you like good action comedies."

"GeorgeRoots","7","1","1","16 November 2013"," In A Perfect World...
","Having myself, father & sister read the comic book, it was one of those rare instances where we all couldn't wait to go see a comic book movie. For what is probably one of comics most strongest indie projects to come along in some time, and the fact the principle storyline tends to sway in each different form of media. The ""Kick-Ass"" story magically works so well enough on print, this comic just had to be made into a film.<br/><br/>The casting choice was solid. Aaron Johnson has slowly built up a solid career, and actually delivers my favourite interpretation of Dave Lizewski. Whereas Nicholas Cage and Chloe Grace Moretz, deliver a truly macabre performance of serious vigilante's ""Big Daddy & Hit Girl"". Finally Christopher ""McLovin"" Plasse is awkwardly charming and funny while Mark Strong makes for a superb crime mogul.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a fantastic looking movie. Vibrant, colourful and extremely well choreographed (Without doubt you can see why the controversy is there). True if the movie wasn't so self aware I would have a lot more to say, but ultimately it really is a decent pop corn flick. If this kind of stuff started taking itself too seriously, I feel it would surely fail.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: Have an open mind and try to see the funny side. In a time where the internet exists and we become more desensitised to violence in pretty much every form of media, ""Kick-Ass"" has a welcome place among its ridiculous bigger budget counterparts. 7/10."
"Bruce722","9","1","1","20 August 2013"," Refreshing take on the superhero concept.
","Kick-Ass is one of the best ""superhero"" movies ever. I put quotes around the word ""superhero"" because it is not your traditional superhero film. The entire concept behind it is very unique and refreshing, the characters are not archetypal at all, the acting is good enough, and the style is very in-your-face. Granted, that in-your-face, overly graphic and profane style will certainly rub many people the wrong way. This is not a film for everyone. The only weak element of the film, and it's also part of its strength, is the ridiculousness of certain scenes and action sequences. I can't know it for that because the fact that it doesn't take itself too seriously is also part of its appeal but there are times when aggravation occurs. Overall, this is a great movie that, while everyone won't enjoy, those that do will certainly love it."
"rogerdarlington","Null","1","1","11 August 2013"," Looking forwards to ""KA 2""
","On paper, this must have looked like a distinctly dubious proposition: a pastiche of the super-hero movie, with teenage kids played by unknown actors taking most of the lead roles, and a script involving foul language and lots of graphic violence. Yet it works a treat with terrific action sequences and splendid humour. The language and the violence are presented in a comic book context that makes them outrageously entertaining rather than in any way offensive or upsetting.<br/><br/>The main credit for this success should go to the British Matthew Vaughan who is both director and co-writer (the other co-writer is Jane Goldman aka Mrs Jonathan Ross), previously known for his direction of Daniel Craig in ""Layer Cake"". Although Nicolas Cage and Mark Strong provide strong acting ballast, most of the key roles are taken by youngsters who acquit themselves well: Aaron Taylor-Johnson as the eponymous Kick- Ass, Christopher Mintz-Plasse as Red Mist, and the wonderful, diminutive 11 year old Chloë Grace Moretz as the purple-wigged Hit-Girl. Excellent soundtrack too."
"sumner_19","4","7","18","28 June 2010"," If my conscience took a holiday, maybe I'd enjoy it more.
","I'll do my best not to attack the film; those that have seen it know it attacks plenty on its own.<br/><br/>From the opening scenes, two things become clear: 1) that this will be a dark comedy, and 2) you're in no danger of being bored. The protagonist's story begins in Dave Lizewski, a high school un-nerdy nerd (a relatable nobody). He desires to be somebody, and he's a comic book fan. Stir those with a sense of altruism and a scuba suit and you've got Kick-Ass, the un-super hero (now a relatable but comical nobody). When he first takes crime fighting action against two men slim-jimming a car, reality strikes.<br/><br/>But then, unreality strikes. Hit Girl is the 'real deal'. She's an eleven-year-old cold-blooded murderer, I mean...super-hero. Brainwashed by Big Daddy (Nick Cage), she's every bit as sympathizing as a malignant tumor. While played well by Chloe Moretz, I couldn't bring myself to laugh at her glorified ass-kicking scenes reminiscent of a Kill Bill bloodbath. Is a brainwashed, violent, albeit gifted little girl chiming ""what a douche"" really comical? Entertaining? OK, sure. Spoiler warning: Wait 'til she's nearly beaten to death.<br/><br/>People seem to praise it's original, satirical and ""pure entertainment"" value. It certainly doesn't make me feel pure if a little girl version of The Bride in Kill Bill is meant to entertain me. A spoiler to it's originality: The nerd getting the gorgeous girl never ceases to ""entertain"" me. Nailing the English teacher would have been more plausible. In one redeeming scene, fully scuba-dressed Kick-Ass finds a lost cat posting and shamelessly takes the matter into his own hands. Now there's a real super hero."

"IMDBiruta","3","6","15","13 September 2010"," It's a movie to Watch.
","For the 'quickers': If you're a teenager who doesn't watch that many movies (especially Black and White ones) and likes teenagers, sex and violence stories, watch this movie! You'll love it! If you're someone who watch a lot of movies, who trained yourself to see them with a sharp eye, and you're alone, still for you I think you should see it, so you can say ""Yes! I saw it! And I think it is rubbish"" Now if you're in the second case and you want a good movie, so you can feel it was well spent money, don't even bother to watch.<br/><br/>Now I can explain for those who want to know why I said that.<br/><br/>First of all I congratulate Chloe Moretz for her work and character. However much she is a 12-year-old girl being a disturbing murderer (not hero, heroes don't kill cold blooded), when she is in the screen she really ""steels the show"" and it is a ""star making performance from her"".<br/><br/>'Kick Ass' is clearly a movie to watch. It is so because it is different, not usual at all. But let's put everything on the right place.<br/><br/>'Kick Ass' takes free violence to a whole new level. I've seen a lot of other movies that doesn't show that much of blood all around, bullet holes in the heads, knifes flying... Well, special effects for that effect. And yet they had so much more meaning when it (which I'm talking about death, the end of a human being's life) occurs. I've realized that in the movie there is a certain idea to be taken, which is (now, I don't think this is a spoiler, but it could be felt like it. If you don't want to risk, skip to next paragraph): it shows what would happen if any regular high school kid decide to become a super-hero, he would be bitten up as crudely as the first time the character Kick Ass decide to do his super hero job. So at that point I respect that crude violence. It is done well and shown perfectly. But as the movie goes on, it is not quite the same.<br/><br/>I can tell this is a movie to entertain, and obviously I can say that many people felt entertained. Off course! The people who made the movie studied hard and worked out their asses to learn how to make a movie entertaining. And since most of the people who will watch the movie doesn't know about how they do it, it is even easier to entertain.<br/><br/>The movie is made for high school kids, so be it, talk about teenager problems, such as friends, drugs, sex, the search for identity, popularity, homosexuality, etc etc. And lately, resulting from many of the video and computer games I guess, the ease to kill. There you go, you don't need to be a genius to know that a movie with such ingredients will be entertaining for the age you're aiming for, and that it will work and sell. In my opinion, and I believe that it is the opinion of many of the regular movie watchers (of all kind, not only teenager kind), it is not a good movie because it doesn't have true brain effort behind it. It is a movie made to sell. Not to be loved and remembered but to make easy money.<br/><br/>Just to add a technical opinion. Some of it's parts tried to use the disturbed violence with intense music, the one that makes people get serious in the cinema room, that was, for example, so well reached by the character of the Joker (Heath Ledger) in Batman – The Dark Knight. The only difference is that the disturbed violence could have a connection with the disturbed character played by Heath Ledger, so it makes sense, and worked wonderfully. In the Kick Ass movie it doesn't have a connection with neither the character or the situation, so it doesn't work at all. It is made only to make the adrenaline go high in those phew minutes by such crude and free violence."
"honorhorror","9","6","15","17 May 2010"," A thoughtful exploration on superhero phenomenons.
","Despite the fact that the movie borrows heavily from titles like Kill Bill, Little Miss Sunshine and other black comedies, it's still a masterpiece on its own. The fact is, no other titles had been so frank, at least not in recent time.<br/><br/>I didn't read the comic book of Kick-Ass, but judging by the quality and story structure of Wanted, I'd say Kick-Ass got the similar spirit of being offensive and downright entertaining at the same time. Note that offensive means not afraid of being dirty. The opening sequences totally told that having Dave quoting ""my only superpower is being invisible to girls"". Later scenes just has the dynamic to surpass your imagination time and time again. Yes, I am entertained.<br/><br/>Below the vulgar surface of the presentation, Kick-Ass is actually more socially concerned than you think(no pun intended). From the beginning, the nature of so-said ""superhero"" is put to examination from all aspects. In some eyes, a superhero is only a wacko in a horrible suit, incapable of growing up. To some, superheroes are basic ingredients of a sustainable life, and note that this applies to both poor and rich kids(or pedestrian kids and gangster kids). To the coolly-dressed-guy who-leaped-off-a-skyscraper-and-crashed-into-a-car, superhero is a leased ID to do something stunning. To the people with vendetta against certain others, superhero is also an acceptable way to sugarcoat vengeance, meaning man-slaughtering. All these facts would round up a commonly-known fact, that superheroes don't exist in real world. Yet, the story didn't end here, because the superhero phenomenon is real anyway. And then we have the 2nd and 3rd act dwelling on this.<br/><br/>Kick-Ass the hero has become widely loved by Americans in the movie, basically because he did something that barely successful but nonetheless heroic. Only for that certain second, Kick-Ass the hero existed. But, his status quo had to be inflated to the level of an idol, a superhero anyway. That's just indifferent from true figures like Ghandi, Teresa the nun, etc. They are not so super in any way, yet the public continues to search for a perfect hero that they can idolize. For Americans, for better or worse, they are tangled with superheroes. Only death can separate them from superheroes, I guess. The Kick-Ass film is smart that it's aware of this fact and satirize on the right notes.<br/><br/>Though, the performances are very remarkable. This may very well be Nicolas Cage's best role in years, and Chloe Moretz who played Hit-girl is also very impressive. Their characters in the movie are downright vigilantes who mirror Dave's superhero dream, yet they are also the most emotional and lovable characters. Mark Strong continues to play funny villains and he's getting better and better.<br/><br/>To those who hate satires, I'd say the bottom-line of Kick-Ass is a well-polished 20-million-dollar-budget ""superhero"" movie which delivers equal fun and brilliance.<br/><br/>9/10. Waiting for the verdict from Oscars."

While attempting to help out Katie Deauxma, his high school crush, he encounters two other vigilantes named Hit Girl and Big Daddy; a deranged father and daughter who are just a bit more serious about dolling out justice.<br/><br/>Kick-Ass is not soul-shattering stuff. It mostly consists of vulgar jokes, gratuitous violence and super hero clichés. The characters aren't particularly interesting and outside of Chloe Moretz, who is actually pretty impressive as Hit Girl, the acting is sub par. The plot is a bit of a mess and it's hard to really follow or care about what is going on. Kick-Ass teeters between action and comedy and never really finds a happy medium. It's not funny enough to be a comedy and not action oriented enough to be a proper action movie.<br/><br/>The music is good and some of the action sequences are impressive, even though suspension of disbelief is a must. I also have to commend Kick-Ass for it's originality and guts as Matthew Vaughn tried to combine many genres and include particularly shocking elements; a little girl slicing and dicing criminals with total relish. But, even though I appreciate him pushing the envelope I dislike the fact that it is used as a gimmick. It's as if Vaughn is saying; ""isn't a little girl killing people cool,"" instead it just being part of the story.<br/><br/>Despite it's few good points Kick-Ass is a failure, mainly because of what it could have been. What was hailed as an ingenious retooling of the super hero genre feels very rehashed.

","When a friend called me on a wet, cold, rainy day to watch this movie ""Kick Ass"", my first reaction was slightly hesitant. The reason being that the only information in which I had heard about this film was that it was a comedic superhero medium film with this ""new teenage awkward nerdy character being the protagonist"", in which yes is funny but I believe this type of film could be wearing a bit thin in my taste. My preconceived notion that I was preparing myself to sit through two hours of Seth Rogan puffing and yelling in amazement that he got out of a some ridiculous situation somehow and talking in his blunt humorous voice to some sort of funny secondary character, or Michael Cera talking awkwardly to some unbelievable good looking American teenage girl. The movie would be funny yes, but I wasn't in the mood, as I had kind of already seen this movie in my mind, if you know what I mean. But how wrong I was. <br/><br/>Enough of my story, the movie started and the narration by the protagonist clearly showed that the writer knew his/hers comic books, not that I know a whole lot but enough to understand this movie will create a fine comic movie, as it is a hard thing to do and there are various ways in which to attack this genre (also that Rogan and Cera were not casted). And I was right as the movie provided iconic references and provides us with a new feel to the comic book stories. The story line is quite simple but retains originality; nerd kid wants to be superhero but is falling and eventually succeeds, ruthless drug dealer villains whom which a man on a quest of revenge with his daughter and is all combined quite well. At the beginning of the movie the comedy of the teenage nerd and his friends was fairly prominent and I thought that this would be the extent of the film. The usual predictable things were happening, e.g., glorifying that dressing up as a hero is idiotic and we laugh at this boy trying to become a superhero, etc. For me so far the movie was OK to watch, but as soon as the protagonist attempts to stop a carjacking and is actually brutally stabbed in the stomach, the movie turned and started to become a real comic book action movie started to emerge as we met other vigilantes, Nick cage (this role was probably his dream role and provided a great performance) and his daughter and their very exaggerated was of killing, moving, planning and access to resources, which we all love in the fantasy world of superhero stories. Other great aspects that indulge us into the comic book world such as long shots of New York, the media's reaction to these heroes, explanation of subplot and some of the cinematography looked like we were watching Batman. <br/><br/>I will try not to reveal any more about the plot of this dark comedy in which I originally thought will be a ""Judd Apatow"" comedy. The characters and their stories play an integral role into which why we laugh or do not turn away as the absolute brutal violence is thrown in front of us. It may be the ""cool"" feeling we receive with the ""cool"" weaponry (strobe light gun), the secondary characters providing as good comedic reliefs, or just the director manages to let us actually go into the world of comics, (where the exaggerated violence is acceptable) as the violence might even go past the movies limits but no one would ever feel it. Maybe all three? Either way the film is a brilliant dark comedy in my opinion, as at times I even forgot it was a comedy and felt quite tense. I still prefer my serious superhero movies and my Coen Bros dark comedies, but in terms of if you're looking for something a little more whacking, having a few more laughs and some really, really cool, action scenes and soundtrack (Titoli- Ennio Morricone, (A Few Dollars More) caused me to sit up in excitement as the 11 year old girl guns her way through some expendable villains), this movie you will enjoy immensely. <br/><br/>8.5/10"

"Ahlberg14","8","7","19","11 May 2010"," A superhero movie, minus the super.
","Kick-Ass isn't your average superhero movie. Unlike Spiderman or Batman, there are no superpowers or crazy gadgets, well except for maybe one device used at the climax. This isn't a movie making a mockery of superheroes either. The main character, Kick-Ass doesn't live up to his name. The characters don't feel artificial because there's real and sometimes gruesome consequences to their actions throughout the film. Mathew Vaughn, director of Layer Cake and Stardust, has crafted a film that indulges in violence and stays entertaining throughout. It's a hybrid movie that feels like Kill Bill, Superbad, and Spiderman were thrown into a blender. Kick-Ass is the end result, and I feel comfortable saying it actually does, to a certain extent.<br/><br/>The relatively unknown Aaron Johnson plays Dave, a delusional, geeky teen who pretends to be a superhero when he puts on a ridiculous green costume. He has no superpowers and his intelligence and coordination are obviously lacking. However, in his delusion he is determined to stand up for what's right. As Kick-Ass, Dave is a laughable vigilante who gets lucky and becomes an online sensation when someone records him scuffling with some thugs. Throughout the film, Dave conceals the identity of Kick-Ass while his friends poke fun at him and his love interest thinks he's a flamer. As Kick-Ass grows in popularity, he gets the attention of crime-boss, Frank D'Amico, played by Mark Strong. Mark actually gives a ""strong"" performance as the film's antagonist. Kick-Ass befriends Frank's son played by Christopher Mintz-Plasse, who will forever be known as McLovin.<br/><br/>The highlight of this film comes in the form of a father-daughter duo played by Nicolas Cage and Chloe Moretz. When they put on their costumes, they are Big Daddy and Hit-Girl. I found their background story very interesting and underdeveloped. They both elevate this movie from mediocrity and quite literally steal the show. Their relationship is entertaining and engaging. Cage adds depth to his small role through his bizarre speech and playful personality. Moretz, playing a foul-mouthed 11 year old, has an aura and panache about her that is quite unique.<br/><br/>Other than Hit-Girl, I didn't find any other adolescent characters very interesting. Dave and his friends were mostly annoying and offered only a few amusing scenes together. I've seen dorky kids like these in countless other movies. I am pleased to say that the script isn't full of cliché's and the dialogue is pretty well-written. As with all action movies, suspension of disbelief is necessary as the body count grows. The violence is a little exaggerated but it fits the tone of the film and makes it more fun to watch.<br/><br/>Just some food for thought: after countless hours of training with specialized weapons, fierce determination, a small stature, and a thirst for vengeance, anything might be possible. If you can't buy that justification, how would you know anyway? Everyday someone in this world goes against all odds and overcomes in something. Why not take a ""that's improbable but not impossible"" point of view! This was solid entertainment that doesn't become tiresome. Don't let the previews mislead you. This isn't your mindless superhero movie or a spoof on superhero movies. Kick-Ass is of a different breed and some (older) people might take offense while others won't find it very enjoyable. To those people: what the hell are you watching a movie titled ""Kick-Ass"" for?"
"DiSTuRBeDx","6","4","9","17 June 2012"," Way too overrated
","It was OK. I don't normally enjoy action films and this can be included. It is a very good action film but not a good film. The acting was good, the directing was really good, everything was good. I just didn't like the script and I just didn't enjoy it. I wanted to enjoy it but I just couldn't.<br/><br/>I like films when the action scenes are well directed like 300 but I just felt it was all over the top. And the jet pack, Jesus Christ the jet pack. The premise was good and the cast was good, I just didn't feel like they went anywhere with it. They could've, but didn't. It tried to be funny and it wasn't as funny as it thought too which just annoyed me.<br/><br/>Fans of action films will love this because, as I said, the action is very good. I mean, visually, it is great but logically, it just isn't. And I don't think it can compete with other action films, especially any film based off a graphic novel like 300 or Sin City."

","Chloe Moretz is exceptional as Hit Girl. Frankly they mis labelled the film. She has the chutzpah of Hermione in the Harry Potter films, with serious attitude and moves to boot.<br/><br/>She makes Angelina Jolie / Lara Croft look, dare I say it, old and slow.<br/><br/>It's really her film, and appropriate that the A-list talent, Nicolas Cage, plays her father, not the 'hero's'.<br/><br/>It's remarkable that the film scores so highly, and a tribute to its peak moments, because the general pacing makes Hannah Montana look racy - long long long voice-over throughout the movie.<br/><br/>We got it, gawky teen, can we move on please.<br/><br/>Yeah, it's good, in fact it's very good, a bronze olympic medal, but it could have been gold. Despite my title, Tomb Raider, and The Matrix - for example - show true craftsmanship. This was highly watchable, occasionally and momentarily brilliant, but in the end too much like rehearsing lines, rather than delivering the play, or practising notes rather than performing a song: snippets and hints of genius and beauty, but too disjointed to leave you with the pleasure and after effect of a a truly great movie."
"sniffle_wiffle","9","4","9","10 September 2010"," Yes it is a bit pro violence, but this is one of the most entertaining films I've ever seen.
","I never saw 'Kick Ass' in the cinema, I bought it recently on blu-ray as it is recommended by many. After watching it I had to say ""Damn! Why did I miss this at the cinema?!"" I love watching films not knowing what to expect, being surprised and amazed while watching it, and that is exactly what happened with 'Kick Ass'. All I really knew about the film prior to watching was that it is about some douche who becomes deluded into being a superhero and that it is also pretty violent, there is much more to it than that. There is also the outrageous black humor, a crazy mob family, Nic Cage, and one of the most bad-ass characters to ever have appeared on a screen - an eleven year old girl!<br/><br/>'Kick Ass' (based on the graphic novel), follows the tale of a normal teenager Dave (Aaron Johnson) who like everyone else exists in a violent and dangerous world, and wonders why no one wants to be a superhero. After being mugged by knife wielding thugs, Dave finally decides to do what others won't and becomes a superhero called 'Kick Ass' despite having no powers or any kind of training at all. He so fittingly puts it later in the film ""Just a dick in a wet suit"". His first fight against crime (unsurprisingly) doesn't go well - he gets stabbed, run over by a car, and barely survives at the hospital. When he returns he is still absolutely determined to be a superhero, and heads out onto the night streets once more, completely blind to how ridiculous he looks to everyone else. Needless to say his second venture to help others ends rather well. He accidentally ends up in a brawl with some crooks and successfully fends them off. The fight gets filmed by some civilians and is put on YouTube and becomes the most watched clip on the internet, and Kick Ass instantly becomes famous across the country.<br/><br/>He catches the attention of two other 'superheroes', Big Daddy (the legendary Nic Cage) and Hit-Girl (Chloe Moretz) who have a story of their own. These two unlike Kick Ass mean business serious business. They don't just fight crime - they obliterate it! Going against many superhero trends they kill criminals instead of capturing them, making Batman look like a fairy queen. It turns out Big Daddy has a vengeful history with the films villain – powerful mob boss Frank D'Amico (played by the fantastic Mark Strong) and has been training himself and his daughter Hit Girl to destroy D'Amico's entire crime empire. Kick Ass manages to land himself right in the middle of this crime war, and it threatens to doom him and everyone around him, including his budding love interest Katie (Lyndsy Fonseca) who thinks he is gay. He discovers being a superhero isn't as cracked up as he thought it would be.<br/><br/>The acting is great all round, Aaron Johnson is suitably wimpy and unforgettable as the titular character. Nic Cage is on fine form as Big Daddy, being crazy, funny and sympathetic all at once, it's a shame he doesn't appear more. Mark is 'Strong' (hee hee get it?) as the villain, something that he is becoming quite notable for doing now. While D'Amico is a cruel and cunning mob boss he also has a family which makes him more interesting, and he isn't a super villain like in other superhero films, he is a real world bad guy. The funniest character had to be D'Amico's nerdy son Chris (Christopher Mintz Plasse) who becomes another 'superhero'- Red Mist.<br/><br/>However the real star of this film is unquestionably Hit-Girl played by the delightful Chloe Moretz. This little girl is a MACHINE!! She also happens to be the source of the films controversy and fame. Never will you have seen such a young child kill so many adults in a single film ever, and in such brutal ways. She is also a potty mouth and probably swears more than any other character, and trust me this film has lots of swearing! Which begs the question, how is such a brutal and offensive character so charming? The finale of the film belongs to her when she raids D'Amico's building, and one of the craziest action sequences I've ever seen unfolds. She practically becomes the main character at the end, and Kick Ass became more like the sidekick. You just want to run up to her and give her a big hug, at the same time you probably also feel like fleeing from her.<br/><br/>Do I have any negative comments about the film? Well actually I do. The film is a bit too violent for its own good. I'm amazed this film didn't get an adult rating; it has more swearing than a Tarantino film, a few unsettling torture and interrogation scenes, and LOTS of blood. As much as I love Hit-Girl, I have to admit it was a bit disturbing to see such a young girl wield guns and knives like a pro. I can understand some critics' arguments about the film trying to encourage children to be violent, but the violence is not to be taken seriously. Also I found Dave's two 'friends' to be quite unlikable, I don't know if they were supposed to be funny, but they came across as irritating and mean.<br/><br/>'Kick Ass' is a visual treat, and has fantastic pacing, you will never get bored for a second. The film is really a study of superheroes in the real world. In our world if someone tried to be a superhero, they would either be deluded losers like Kick Ass, or extremely violent vigilantes like Big Daddy and Hit-Girl, which is interesting, however it doesn't show us all this without having a lot of fun. It isn't to everyone's cup of tea, but if this is your tea, you're going to lap it up!"
"brando647","8","4","9","9 September 2010"," Is the Film Any Good? The Title Says It All.
","Everything you need to know about this movie is right there in the title. From start to finish, this movie is loaded with enough action and humor that I never got bored. It grabs your attention the moment the movie begins with a wanna-be superhero diving off a skyscraper with his makeshift flight suit, leading into the initial realization of our main character Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) that no one's ever tried to be a superhero. Inspired by his favorite comic heroes, Dave throws together his own costume and takes to the night streets to fight crime. It's not long before he finds himself in over his head, attracting the attention of both a father-daughter crime-fighting duo and the city's biggest drug kingpin.<br/><br/>For those who haven't seen it yet, do not go in expecting your average comic book film. This film is brutal. It doesn't pull punches are there the violence isn't limited to the blood-less beatings you find in Spider-Man or Iron Man. KICK-ASS is loaded with bloody bullet hits, impalings, hacked limbs, and unapologetic gore. And the best part, most of it is dealt by a 10 year old girl. I know that part's made a good amount of people angry and has surely stopped plenty of people from even giving the movie a chance. Roger Ebert was so put off by the concept of a kid committing acts of graphic violence that he gave it the worst review possible. When you watch this film, you just need to have fun with it. From the moment I heard of this movie, I knew what to expect and I had a blast watching a kid slice-n-dice and drops F-bombs. Some might argue that it sets a bad example, but seriously...who in their right mind would let their kid watch this movie?<br/><br/>Director Matthew Vaughn (who did the equally awesome LAYER CAKE) did an awesome job with this film, and he collected the best people for the job. Aaron Johnson is the high school geek with delusions of grandeur and is hilariously uncoordinated in his superhero efforts, enjoying the perks of fame despite getting his butt kicked regularly. He did a good job but he was often out-shined by his friends, played by Clark Duke and Evan Peters. The best part of the movie was Nicholas Cage and Chloe Moretz as Big Daddy and Hit Girl. I'm sure I'm the minority opinion but this was one of my favorite Nic Cage roles ever. As Damon Macready, his goofy demeanor reminds me of a father you'd see on a 50's sitcom but once he dons his costume as Big Daddy, he's a violent vigilante who dresses like Batman and sounds like Adam West. He is teamed with his daughter, Mindy, as Hit-Girl. Just like Cage, she's got dual personas...as Mindy she's freakin' adorable (it was funny watching her get super-excited about trading an extra bullet to the chest in her training for a trip to the bowling alley) but as Hit-Girl she's downright sadistic and growls like Dirty Harry.<br/><br/>The villains in the film were great. Mark Strong and Christopher Mintz-Plasse are Frank D'Amico and his son Chris. Frank is the city's top crime boss and his son wants nothing more than to be a part of his business. Chris finds his way in when he convinces his father the best way to bring down Kick-Ass is to pose as another new superhero, Red Mist. Mintz-Plasse is at a disadvantage because I still see him as McLovin from SUPERBAD but I suppose it works for this character, contributing to his nerdy awkwardness as he tries to enter the world of crime.<br/><br/>All right, I've written more than enough about how much fun this movie was and how great a job the cast did, but the whole movie can be summed up with it's title. It doesn't lie and anyone who's a fan of superhero films should give this film a watch. It takes a classic template and warps it into something brutally entertaining."

","I guess I am just a sucker for those movies where the underdog overcomes prejudice, ridicule and overwhelming odds to win respect, impose justice or just get the cute girl. Whether it's a 40-year old virgin, a high school geek or the unlikely employee of the month, I get vicarious joy from watching the small (or goofy) guy win. But with Kick Ass, Hollywood has a number of surprises for you. Who would of thought a prepubescent, 11-year old girl could embody all hopes and aspirations of us armchair superhero lovers. Who thinks this stuff up? The running jump shot to the head under strobe light has to be one of the finest cinemagraphic effects I've seen in years. The music is great and well chosen for each scene. I think you'll really enjoy this one. But moms, don't rent this one for your tweens. The language is very adult."

Batman has been my all-time favorite, no one touches his style and mannerisms. But the topic 'I' am talking about today, is about a set of self-made superheroes, who are strange/abusive/violent and majorly amusing. Pesto, let's enter the world of 'Kick-Ass'! <br/><br/>Based on the comic book of the same name by Mark Millar and John Romita, Jr, 'Kick-Ass' is truly a kick-ass film, that leaves you enthusiastic. It won't be wrong to state 'Kick-Ass' amongst the best films of 2010. Matthew Vaughn who has earlier made memorable films, makes his careers best effort! <br/><br/>Story of an ordinary teenager, who sets out to become a real-life superhero calling himself 'Kick-Ass'. Dave gets caught up in a bigger fight when he meets Big Daddy, a former cop who, in his quest to bring down the evil drug lord Frank D'Amico, has trained his eleven-year-old daughter to be the ruthless vigilante 'Hit-Girl'. It's a normal revenge story from one side, and 'I Will Stand Up For What's Right' from the other. Hahah, 'Kick-Ass' defies normal stuff, and makes it's superheroes as real as possible.<br/><br/>'Kick-Ass' has the coolest super-kid! 'Hit Girl' is 'Kick-Ass', by all means. She is the most effective guard possible, and undoubtedly, a cult-personality in the film-dom. And... Red Mist is the worst superhero ever!! <br/><br/>Matthew Vaughn has enjoyed making this film, and his love for his dream-project is visible from scene A to Z. Ben Davis's Cinematography is top-notch. The Editing is sleek. Stunts are 'Kick-Ass'!!<br/><br/>In the acting department, Nicolas Cage steals the show. The Academy-Award Winner is incredible, and is truly missed after he leaves the scene. Aaron Johnson as the original 'Kick-Ass' is superb. Chloë Grace Moretz as my favorite 'Hit Girl' is fantastic. She lives her part from start to end. Mark Strong is quite good as the evil-head. Christopher Mintz-Plasse as Red Mist, is annoying. Clark Duke is likable. Lyndsy Fonseca is perfect.<br/><br/>On the whole, 'Kick-Ass' rocks!

","""Come on, be honest with yourself. At some point in our lives, we all wanted to be a superhero."" <br/><br/>I'm loving the recent bounty of ""real people as superheroes"" movies. Whether they're adaptations of graphic novels like Kick-Ass and Watchmen, or original stories like Defendor and the upcoming movie Super, I can't get enough of them.<br/><br/>Kick-Ass (the graphic novel) is like Watchmen for the new generation. Not as momentous or genre-defining of course, but still just as post-modern, in its own way. The movie adaptation does feature some changing and refocusing of the original story, but I think it holds up pretty well.<br/><br/>Kick-Ass is entertaining, which is the most important thing. Funny often, violent often, often funny AND violent, and (very) occasionally poignant. Nicholas Cage is better suited for this kind of irreverent movie than almost anything more serious, Aaron Johnson is a decent Dave, Christopher Mintz-Plasse is as funny as usual, and Chloe Moretz steals the show, as she often does. The more the movie focuses on her, the better it is.   <br/><br/>A lot of fuss had been made about the violence in this movie, and of course, Hit Girl. Well, those people would be shocked to know that the story and Hit Girl herself have greatly been toned down from what you'd see if you read the graphic novel. Several of the more ""questionable"" things were cut out of the movie entirely, and the ending is decidedly more general audience friendly than it originally was. <br/><br/>Kick-Ass (while violent, don't get me wrong) is no more violent than something like Watchmen, and beyond the shock factor some people may feel about seeing a 12 year- old use some very improper language, there's nothing here more offensive than what you'd see in a similarly rated action movie. All of Hit Girl's scenes (really, the entire movie) are so over the top and unrealistic, that I honestly don't see how anyone could be bothered by that character. If she's an issue for you, this really isn't the kind of movie you should be watching. I just thought I'd address that, because I quite frankly thought that the controversy over all that was ridiculous.<br/><br/>You should easily be able to tell from the trailer if you'll this movie. If you thought those were awesome, you'll enjoy this. If you thought otherwise, don't bother. It's not for you. Fans of the graphic novel should also be reasonably pleased, as the casting was solid, a lot of the story was kept intact, and it's just plain fun to watch."

It involves a major character, darkness, lots of enemies, night-vision goggles, a fantastic POV shot, and, eventually, a strobe light attached to a gun.

Kickass, hit girl, Big daddy suddenly seem so possible unlike spiderman, superman or anyone of those heroes with SUPERPOWERS. Background score was great. The music blended perfectly with the movie.I especially liked the Prodigy's score where they introduce Aaron Johnson. Characters are also so comic-like.

Well, at first I'd say that in the last years I've always been let down by a lot of movies which seemed quite interesting but which never impressed me. Maybe because of trite plots, maybe because of the lost passion for cinema of the directors whose interests concern just money, because of the dammit sequels and so on... I was praying God for not being let down even by this movie and...He realized my wish. OK, I'm pretty mad I had been travelling for two hours by plane but...it was WORTH! Then if I say so I think you have probably already understood how I thought this movie was. The first thing that leaps to the eyes is characters. I completely fell in love with Kick Ass, Hit Girl and overall Red Mist (I could be gay for him lol). The plot, even if it concerns a super-hero story, it's different from the traditional ones 'cause here everything's real (you may see youtube, played songs that really exist in everyday life, and the REAL kick-ass comic book) and it's not so exaggerate as traditional ones: no superpowers, just the normal strength of (quite) normal people. Special effects are worth of a special mention overall for fighting scenes (I love Hit-Girl ""parkour"" and her acrobatic actions). I am just disappointed because of the fact that a lot of fantastic movies are often not published in many countries and that's a great pity.

"manicman84","9","8","23","25 April 2010"," a refreshingly funny and wickedly entertaining spectacle that warrants the whole franchise of masked teenagers to come
","Aptly titled Kick-Ass is an excellent comic book adaptation that proves that there is no stagnation in a superhero genre whatsoever. Based on Mark Millar's violent tale Kick-Ass is directed by Matthew Vaughn, the filmmaker who happens to have a real knack for both action movies (Layer Cake) and teen fantasies (Stardust). It's more than evident in Kick-Ass and although the film has some problems with selecting the proper tone: it verges between campy comedy, dramatic piece and action spectacle, this is a gripping ride from start to finish.<br/><br/>Vaughn's direction is nothing less than clever and kinetic. By employing video game techniques inspired by Shoot 'Em Up and Crank movies, Vaughn really excels at showing highly-stylized bloody violence on screen. As for the script, the main concept of an ordinary teenager who chooses to become a superhero is downright effective evoking loads of laughs and our sympathy. Aaron Johnson's cool, unrestrained performance also helps a great deal.<br/><br/>The film revitalizes the genre by undermining its rules. The characters involved have no special powers, most of them, no necessary backstory and no turning point that resulted in them becoming superheroes, much like in Watchmen. Despite this, the movie establishes its own pantheon of heroes and the director knows that there's nothing more fascinating than the battle between good and evil shown in a vivid, exciting fashion.<br/><br/>What's controversial about the film is the extensive use of pitch-black humor including the character of 11-year-old Mindy McReady aka Hit-Girl who has been trained from the early years to become a killing machine by her loving father aka Big Daddy. The whole subplot may be immoral for some who don't understand this kind of cinema, yet it's surprisingly plausible due to a tongue-in-cheek writing and acting talents of Chloe Moretz and Nicolas Cage who are as subversive in their respective parts as you can get. Last but not least, the artist formerly known as McLovin' channels a wannabe villain named Red Mist. You may be actually surprised by how smart he is in his plotting.<br/><br/>Overall, Kick-Ass is a refreshingly funny and wickedly entertaining spectacle that warrants the whole franchise of masked teenagers to come. 9/10 (A-)"

"DonFishies","8","8","23","16 April 2010"," A riotously hilarious blood-soaked film that lives up to its namesake from start to finish
","Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) is bored at school, bored with life. He is not quite a loser, but he is by no means popular either. He enjoys reading comics, and decides one day it may be a good idea to become a superhero and fight crime himself. After a rather messy mishap, he is soon caught on camera helping someone getting beat up, and becomes an internet sensation. And then he starts to meet other people wearing masks.<br/><br/>Much like the comic/graphic novel it is based on, Kick-Ass is exactly that. It is a riotously enjoyable time from start to finish. I had originally thought Matthew Vaughn and Jane Goldman would run into more than their share of problems trying to adapt one of the most ridiculously violent comics in recent memory. But the independent funding and creation of the film seems to have worked in their favour, because the film has a go-for-broke style unlike most mainstream films.<br/><br/>While I imagined it would be worse, Kick-Ass is an incredibly brutal and often disgustingly violent picture. People are chopped up, crushed, beaten, or shot, and the film revels in how red the screen quickly becomes. It does nowhere near equal the same insane amount of blood shed in the comics, but it does more than a worthwhile job attempting to come close. Some of the unique and creative angles and designs for some of the deaths are simply awesome all on their own. I am not overly squeamish, but the film is not for the weak of heart. This is a very hard R-rated film, and one that surprised me by how much made it through the censors.<br/><br/>Unlike Robert Rodriguez and Zack Snyder before him, Vaughn has crafted a film that loosely follows the Kick-Ass series, but takes its own turns. I re-read the comics before seeing the film just as a refresher, and I found myself riveted at just the right intervals, whether they were originally in the books or the film's own deviation. A lot of the material and moments in the film feel just right, and help amplify the plot in some areas, and simplify it in others. I particularly enjoyed that they kept with the zany, Quentin Tarantino-style profanity-laden dialogue, and kept all the references to other comics. It would have been easy for Vaughn and Goldman just to re-create the comics, but making it their own without much sacrifice makes it feel and come off almost as great as the trailers do.<br/><br/>If there is anything I do hold against their changes, it is the fact that some of the mean-spiritedness of the original story is missing here. Some of the changes, specifically with the character of Katie Deauxma (Lyndsy Fonseca) and to a point, the origins of Hit Girl (Chloë Grace Moretz) and Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage), lack the power and the message found in the original works by Mark Millar and John Romita Jr. The book was a dark mess of humour, satire and gruesome violence. But it was deadly serious in many areas. The film on the other hand, when it is not falling into second act ill paced melodrama (not necessarily bad, but not well paced either), never once takes itself serious. It just wants to be fun, and it wants to entertain the audience. A good chunk of the film's ending feels like it belongs in a comic book more than the material in the books themselves. I can respect this, but the two integral pieces of the original story I mentioned, seem like they should have been recreated here. I am all for the majority of changes made, but that vast majority kept with the integrity and style of the original work. Taking stuff like those mentioned out, seems like a disservice to the audience.<br/><br/>Acting wise, everyone does a terrific job in their roles. Cage, almost unrecognizable, delivers a subtle and bizarre performance as Big Daddy. I figured he would ham it up for the majority of the film, and while he does, he manages to come off as a heartfelt and interesting character. This is not the typical off-the-rails performance Cage is usually known and loved for, but his strange twist on the fairly one-dimensional character is reason enough to see the film. Mark Strong is great as mob boss and primary villain Frank D'Amico, and rather surprisingly, Christopher Mintz-Plasse brings a life and energy to Chris D'Amico/Red Mist that I never knew he had. Yes, there are times when he is channeling McLovin, but he makes Chris the character he needs to be.<br/><br/>The relatively unknown Johnson is a marvel as both Dave and Kick-Ass. His juggling act of trying to make something of himself while fighting with teenage angst is something we can all identify with, and is what makes the character so endearing in the first place. To see him brought to life so well and so realistically is simply magnificent. We feel his pain at every turn, and we understand all too well what his problems are. He is the real approximation of what it would be like for any one of us to act like Batman, and Johnson never once stops being that character. But unfortunately, the film really belongs to Moretz. She alternates at random between cute and cuddly Mindy Macready and the violently vicious assassin Hit Girl like a seasoned professional. She steals the show every chance she gets, and for good reason. Her dialogue, her actions, everything about her is amazing, and a testament to how incredible this young actor is now, and will quickly become.<br/><br/>If you can stand the violence, Kick-Ass is an incredibly enjoyable time at the movies. What it lacks in seriousness, it more than makes up for in fun and humour. It is unlike any comic book movie you have seen, and likely, ever will see.<br/><br/>8.5/10.<br/><br/>(This review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com)."
"lasttimeisaw","9","3","6","1 December 2011"," Kick-ass
","I saw half of the film on HBO several months ago in the hotel room and it became another unfinished business which had been gnawing at me until yesterday I eventually watched it from A to Z, and my response is that it's really a kick-ass to all other major film studio comic superhero franchises! <br/><br/>I don't intend to put a stance to appreciate this film just to feign that my heart is still as young as a schoolboy. I love this film from the bottom of my heart and I emphatically believe director Matthew Vaugh has done a stupendous job which almost alter the entire formula of the corny genre and what's more worth a round of standing ovation is that the film is killingly entertaining as well!<br/><br/>Hit-girl is predestined to become a cult idol along with the film itself (and its box office fiasco is a bonus), the controversy she created has becoming a sensational impressiveness which stuns the youngster generation and some maturer age group like mine. A 12 year old slaughterer with an innocent loli's face and mind, which may not be original but definitive provocative, and the gratifying yet unsettling part is Chloë's steadfast-cum-innocuous performance, killing only could be such fun in a morally nontoxic way which a film is able to manifest and I can sense the surreal zest pervading in the air! <br/><br/>Kick-ass (an unostentatious Aaron Johnson) by comparison, is a more empathizing character, which is also dealt with some realistic impetus to allow viewers to judge it by a more rational afterthought, a true hero never need the shield of ""super"" power, all one needs is training and proper equipment, a pragmatic truth (it's more convenient if you are as filthy rich as Iron Man or Batman).<br/><br/>The film and the directing definitely crack into my top 10 list of the year and Chloë is among my top 3 supporting actress in 2010 as well. Also I feel a bit belated compassion that Matthew Vaugh's forte didn't been fully brought into play in the X-MEN: FIRST CLASS this year as sadly few could substantiate his true color under the mainstream Hollywood sway, especially for those newly-recruited."

"DangerKitten","1","6","16","1 July 2011"," Poorly Executed and Downright Creepy
","This is literally the worst movie I have ever seen, which was a surprise based on the good reviews I have seen and the decent trailer. <br/><br/>Going in, I was expecting a mediocre movie exploiting the popularity of superhero movies about a nerdy teenager who thinks he'll be cooler if he dresses in an embarrassing costume and tries to beat up baddies. This was mainly accurate, but it was so much worse. <br/><br/>Not only was the main character unlikeable, he never really grew. He was clueless at the beginning, and just a big an idiot at the end. Oh, he got the girl, so he must have improved somehow, according to the writers. <br/><br/>The story was bad. It was a mish-mash of previous superhero movies mixed with teen comedies and dramas. Basically, a vanilla teenager wants to get girls and glory, so he does something crazy to differentiate himself from the crowd. Then the shenanigans begin. He finds himself in a bunch of awkward situations that are supposed to be funny (possibly), but are mostly embarrassing. Then he encounters another fake superhero duo. <br/><br/>This is where the movie gets creepy. This superhero duo, a father-daughter team, rescue the hopeless kid from getting himself beat up by his love-interest's ex-boyfriend. Instead of simply disarming the semi-violent ex, the daughter (who's about 11 years old) goes on to not only kill the ex, but everyone else in the room for no apparent reason. I have no problem with gratuitous violence, but this was just psychotic without a reason to be. What is this movie trying to say with this character? Training a child to kill without reason is what psychopaths do, and yet she and her father are portrayed as, if not heroes, at least justified in their actions. <br/><br/>In conclusion, this is a movie with a stereotypical story, unlikable characters, and elements that make one wonder if the makers of this movie also recommend drowning puppies as a form of entertainment."
"saarvardi","6","6","16","26 May 2010"," Was I supposed to enjoy watching an 11 year old kid getting all beat up?
","Sure, many people loved this allegedly realistic (yeah right) comic book film, but I beg to differ. Sure, it had a nice idea in its core (how would comic book characters act in the real world, told through the eyes of a nerdy teenager?). Unforutnaely, it got tangled up in its own web during the second half - when secondary characters took over the screen and turned into a bloody mess which totally forgot the point it sets out to tell.<br/><br/>Being more specific, Kick Ass was a movie I found extremely offensive - mostly because of the Hit Girl character. She was cartoonish and unreal, an 11 year-old girl talking and acting like a pretentious adult, which then goes on to beat the crap out of numerous bad guys. Kids aren't supposed to kill people - good or bad. They're supposed to enjoy what little innocence they have left at this day and age. Instead, this character just acts as a parade of everything that's wrong and immoral about today's children (cursing, beating, acting too old for their own good).<br/><br/>To top it all - near the end of the film, Mark Strong's character gets back at Hit Girl and gives her a long, hard beating. Aren't there any rules about the way children are portrayed on the big screen? Was I supposed to enjoy watching an 11 year old kid getting all beat up by an adult? If there are rules that prevent underage minors from appearing nude or being sexualized, why isn't there any supervision on the portrayal of violence towards and from minors on screen?"

","A good month ago I saw the trailers of kick-ass and then i just knew it. This movie was going to ROCK. Never in my life have I watched such a genius movie. The makers just said F*ck to everything and they just did their thing. The balance between Action, Comedy & Touchy Drama was PERFECT!<br/><br/>The Actors/Actresses were chosen greatly. No one could of the played the role of Kick-Ass better than Aaron Johnson. Nicolas Cage was a perfect choice to play Big-Daddy. And off course, the O so cute Chloe Moretz. She was so cool as Hit-Girl. The thing that makes it so cool, is that it is never done before. A goddamn 12 year old killing bad guys, that just rocks (!I reject disgusting-thoughts!). Now i have to say the action did stay very 'Comic-like', so being the fact it's a 12 year old,it's nothing to get disturbed about. If you really don't want your kids (at least 11!) to see this movie, then it will be for Hit-Girl saying words like: C*NT, C*CK, A-hole and um ... Dumb-ass.<br/><br/>Other characters like Red-Mist (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) and Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong) are just the perfect choice. And the Music, I LOVED IT. Really epic sounds, that make the movie complete. (I love the song of Mika, by the way)<br/><br/>I would say just go see this movie. It can satisfy everyone, if it is the Music, Action, Acting, or whatever.

In case you forgot - that means the ratings board agrees with you that it isn't smart to take your 6 yr old to see this movie.

"Smam747","10","7","20","17 April 2010"," A Kick Ass Movie!
","This movie had all the right ingredients for a perfect movie; great writing, compelling characters, comedy, action, a little girl cursing and slicing off limbs. All around this movie was WAY more than I was expecting. Going into the theater, I thought I might have just wasted $10.50 on another movie trying to be cool for coolness sake. This movie isn't trying to be cool, it just is. <br/><br/>This movie had a realness that is usually missing in most films made today. The movie plays very genuine and honest, even though most of what you're watching is unbelievable. At times in this movie I felt like I was watching a Tarantino movie. There is a lot of gory but nonetheless absolutely entertaining fight scenes that are balanced out with a lot of comedy and drama.<br/><br/>Great cast, Aaron Johnson is believable. He doesn't magically transform into something he's not, but has a personal awakening. Clark Duke is funny as always and adds comedy at needed moments throughout. Christopher Mintz-Plasse was alright. He doesn't have everything I thought the red mist character should have, but he did a good enough job. We'll see how he plays it in a sequel. Nick Cage was better than I've seen him in awhile. Playing the doting father whose fathering tactics border on insane. And finally Chloe Moretz, of 500 days of summer fame. She absolutely stole the show. She is the best part of the movie. Hit girl just went to the top of my most B.A. characters of all time list. Keep an eye out for this chick in the future. She's already head and shoulders above most of the actresses in Hollywood. <br/><br/>All in all, everything is there. There is something for everyone is this movie. You will not leave disappointed. All I can say is GO TO THE THEATER RIGHT NOW!"
"cherold","3","5","13","22 May 2012"," creepy, dull, and dumb
","There is so much wrong with this movie on so many levels that it is hard to know where to begin. So I'll walk you through it.<br/><br/>It begins with a dweeb who takes it into his mind to be a superhero. Why? Well, the movie goes out of its way to deny there's a reason; he's not avenging anything, he doesn't seem to have a strong feeling about crime, he's not remotely physically capable of being a superhero. But he tries it. And he gets badly hurt. And even though he is badly hurt for something he seems to have little passion for, he keeps doing it.<br/><br/>So early on in the film, I'm feeling a disconnect. I don't understand the protagonist's motivation, and I don't find him particularly likable. And the movie itself is a rather middling, unfunny comedy that can't decide if it's going for realism (his lame costume, the way he gets beat up) or dumb comedy (the way he pretends to be a gay to befriend a girl he likes).<br/><br/>20 minutes or so in, I was feeling like giving up on the movie, but I just kind of wanted to see where they were going with the whole premise, because so far the movie had a wandering, confused feel to it.<br/><br/>Then comes the scene where the kid confronts a room full of criminals, even though if he had a brain in his head he would understand that would get him killed. And it would have if an 11-year-old girl who, it has been established, has been trained in weapons by her unstable but loving father, didn't come in and kill the 8 or 9 people in the room.<br/><br/>This marks a real shift in the movie. All pretense to reality is tossed out, as the little girl, wearing a superhero costume, slices and dices everyone in the room. It's a horrific scene, since many of the people she gleefully murders just want to run away. It is psychotic vigilante justice.<br/><br/>A normal teens reaction to seeing mass murder would be one of horror and lifelong trauma, but instead the kid just envies these people for being the ""real deal."" And even though he considers doing the only intelligent thing and quitting, he doesn't do that.<br/><br/>The problem, I think, is that this movie isn't quite sure what it wants to be. It's not an over-the-top comic-book comedy, it's not an adrenaline-rush action picture, it's not a drama about trying to find your place in the world, but a weird, completely unsuccessful attempt to veer wildly from one to the other.<br/><br/>I kept watching for a while, still curious as to where on earth they were going with this, but as I watched the little girl murder another man in a car crusher and saw the mob boss's son's silly plan to entrap the hero, the fact that I was both completely bored and rather disturbed became too much for me. So I read the plot synopsis in wikipedia, and nothing I read in it made me regret stopping where I did.<br/><br/>Perhaps this all worked in the comic book the movie was based on. The very unreality inherent in comic books might make this weird mish-mash come together. But the movie, or at least the first half of it, is a train wreck."
"simon-dotkov","3","5","13","20 October 2010"," ""Kick-Ass"" or ""How I came to love the Retard-Bomb""...
","I occasionally throw myself into the realm of comic book inspired movies with lots of skepticism and vigorous hate towards plots that might entertain a ten year old, but when I see the main character almost defeated and beyond all expectations and subtlety a goddamn machine gun-rigged jet-pack growls in and saves the day, I tend to feel rather betrayed, as if a mentally ill child is trying to entertain me with almost impossible cliffhangers, only to preserve moral standards later with the power of MEGA Jesus! OK, in the beginning, the movie starts rather well; gritty and ALMOST real, I could feel a bit immersed as if it is really possible to be a superhero in real life and after a very ironic turn of events in which I giggled like a baby being stimulated by its' prostate, when the main character dressed like a superhero got stabbed the first damn second he decided to be Superman, the entire movie went downhill with the appearance of Nicolas Cage and his satanic little daughter that can surgically remove a baby from a mother's womb while skydiving. When you see such retardation, you immediately try to reconfigure your brain to accept that ""Ok, this is a movie, it's supposed to be retarded, it's based on a F'ING AMERCIAN COMIC after all"", but it won't work, because the movie just changes with no warning at all. It's like a hooker that almost gets you climax when suddenly she mentions that this would have never happened while she was still a MAN. It kind of cheats you out of what you expected to watch (that is, if you missed to see the semen-gobbling trailer...) and you end up with an entirely different movie, and you can no longer identify yourself in it, because all eleven year old girls that start a fight with a dozen mobsters in real life WILL GET GANGBANGED IN THE GODDAMN EYE SOCKETS! If you have a brain that is bypassed enough to be compatible with the ""realism"" in this movie, there still remains the issue with the plot development. I'm not going to comment on the action (if you can call it that), because action nowadays is all about one guy bum-raping an entire squadron of professional killers, while the camera floats around like it's on Ketamine or something, and the protagonist uses all sorts of amazing in-air techniques to reload his guns, molest bystanders and pick his nose while diving in the air. I'm sorry, Hollywood, but after Jackie Chan, you better start thinking of something else, something... I don't know... ORIGINAL!? So the plot, yes, if all else fails, let's just hope the plot stays solid, right? Well, to be perfectly honest, it almost put me to sleep, the only question I had in my mind, after I predicted the entire action sequence (except for the Gatling-gun jet-pack, god, how much Acid do you need to come up with that crap!?) and plot development, I only wondered if the evil mastermind's son, Red Mist, is going to be killed or not, and right before the end, I was certain he'd be left alive, because KILLING CHILDREN IS WRONG AND IT WON'T SELL! Yeah, but murdering hundreds of grown-ups that had families and lived long lives to get to that point, and probably are living a miserable existence having a lot to fight for are being SLICED BY AN EFFIN ELEVEN YEAR OLD. Sorry, but even though a lot of people recommended me this movie, I can only hate them for that and the bile that it spew all over my synapses will never be fixed and no amount of booze or weed will delete it. Next time when I see something with gay pride costumes, I'll pass it like an angry skinhead that thinks he's very tough, but won't dare touch his target minority because ""he might get sewed..."" :D Love, Sim"
"tnrcooper","10","5","13","30 May 2010"," Great self-aware superhero movie for superhero fans
","If you see every superhero movie, if you appreciate Superman more than the average bear, if you get the sense that you have a little too much faith in superheroes, this might just be the movie for you. However, it'd probably be best if you like a film like ""Pulp Fiction"" and/or the ""Kill Bills"" too because there is lots of violence and lots of filthy language in this one. Confused yet? <br/><br/>This film is about some regular-that is to say anonymous-high schoolers, who are frustrated in understanding girls, they like comic books, they mercilessly insult one another-but in a friendly way. Well, one of these boys, Dave (Aaron Johnson-likable in a shaggy-dog way and well-chosen for the part), in the midst of one the endless neurotic, intense conversations that teenagers have about the course of their lives, about members of the opposite sex, about things they like, concludes that there's no reason why a superhero shouldn't try and save the world. So he sets out to be that superhero, making his own hilariously tacky superhero costume and finding himself in over his head when he realizes that knives will still injure him. It's inspiring the degree to which he believes one person can make a difference and quite funny but as audience members, we obviously know that he doesn't really have any superpowers and that if his attempt to disarm the bad guys fail, that he will be seriously injured. Dave's sweet naiveté is the very trait however, which buys him the good-will that ensures we will root for and follow his adventures throughout the film.<br/><br/>Like Tarantino, this film combines some rather mundane characters and some rather outrageous escapades. However, because the characters' reactions are so sensible and identifiable, we don't squirm or root against them. The things that they do and say seem like sensible responses to events which occur in their life. It is precisely the earthiness of the characters that keeps the plot from seeming exploitative or outrageous. <br/><br/>As the movie continues, Dave knows that his superhero powers are limited but it doesn't diminish his desire to do some good. However, he is more realistic about the challenges he can surmount and after he lowers his expectations, he is able to do some good. In doing some good, he crosses paths with another young, would-be superhero, Hit-Girl (played with ruthless cuteness by the talented young actress Chloe Moretz, who I'm sure we will be hearing more of) who gallivants around town, attempting to right wrong although it turns out, her actions are not motivated simply by a desire to impose moral order in the world. Her father is Big Daddy (Nicholas Cage playing with abandon and panache and reminding us once again just how talented he can be when he decides not to cash in for an easy check) and he's the most immoral father you have ever seen on screen, I'd venture to guess. Also excellent in the film are Frank D'Amico as ruthless mob boss Mark Strong and his needy son Chris D'Amico (played with a wonderful playfulness by Chris Mintz-Plasse of ""McLovin"" fame). The supporting roles are also filled quite adequately by a variety of lesser lights. <br/><br/>The tone of this film might be the most impressive thing over which director Matthew Arnold has control. On the one hand, the violence is so graphic that if one were to allow it without leavening it with fairly mundane characters, the film would be rather sensationalist. On the other hand, if he allowed his characters to talk and be neurotic too much, it would be just another neurotic fanboy film about teenagers much too obsessed with superheroes. As it is, the director has struck a nice balance, playing the naiveté of teenagers off the wild, anarchic results of some sensible decisions. The movie feels like a Tarantino film-intelligent people who like to discuss things combined with some graphic violence. Like Tarantino's flics, the choice of music is crucial and helpful in establishing the direction of the film also.<br/><br/>The screenplay by Jane Goldman and director Matthew Arnold, and the (presumably) excellent comic book by John Romita Jr. and Mark Millar are, as said, very good. It would have been very easy to go wrong with the tone, and that Arnold captures regular people who recognize their limitations but who strive on all the same, often to hilarious and clever results, is a tribute to Arnold's management of the tone and direction of the film."

Its actually the opposite. Its a normal guy (or well, hes a geek) who gets mugged, and there's a guy standing in a window not even calling 911 to help. Now see THATS messed up. This make him want to fight bad guys, and clear the streets of crime.<br/><br/>However, he soon finds out that its not so easy as he thought.<br/><br/>I love the RED MIST, hes the perfect villain in this movie. Badass car, bad-ass costume and bad-ass haircut. But the real beauty of this movie is that they got a young girl, being hit girl. That just blew my mind away.<br/><br/>The way she moves is indescribable, you actually get to see some REAL action from her in the end of the movie, plus purple wig = cute! She shows no mercy, kills without remorse, but she still delivers it so that viewers gasp each time.<br/><br/>There's a lot of small details, but i will not tell you anymore now.<br/><br/>If you haven't already, GO WATCH IT. This is not a movie for kids by the way. This is best enjoyed at home accompanied with popcorn, soda and high volume.<br/><br/>Kick-ass just, blows you away. I give it an 8/10 for spectacular screenplay, storyline and the way it just clings you to the screen till the end."

","I had no idea what to think of this movie when i saw the trailer. It's a very darkly humorous movie and if you find a 10 year old slaughtering gangsters then don't watch the movie and go give it a bad review. The cinematography was great the acting was good and the screenplay was funny and very real. Some of the characters are very relatable and the movie isn't so unrealistic that it ruins the movie. The plot wasn't stunning but it does not bring the movie down. The fight scenes are flawless and the humor was great.

","Watched Kick Ass today...wow what an amazing film. A very unique plot and many laugh out loud moments keep you in your seat. The director puts you right there where the action is and keeps the movie flowing. All the characters did a fantastic job!<br/><br/>A well done movie all together! There is the high school experience and the family life. Expect the unexpected, and the movie doesn't dumb you down. Superbad meets Kill Bill is an excellent analogy for this movie. It pays homage to every super hero ever and guess what? I have my new superhero! Kick ass definitely can spawn a lot of other movies in the same genre...what genre that is? I am not sure.

","I would put this movie up there with Avatar as far as my favorites. Kick-Ass is original and very good at humor. And wow, do they pull some surprises. I heard one guy say it was way better than Ninja Assassin; which I thought was awesome too. You can either get your ass-kicked or you can kick-ass and that is what this movie did; BAD-ASS!! I was going to laugh at Cage's costume but wow he had some sweet gear; his fight scene was awesome. The whole audience was shocked when ""Daddy"" and ""Mindy"" were first introduced. I remember all I could say was, ""Oh wow"" The Kick-Ass character was well played and funny and who, I think, a lot of us can relate to."
"damiensean","10","7","21","7 April 2010"," The best superhero film ever
","I thought this film was so original and highly amusing as well. Every one should check it out. The themes in the film, although very adolescent in nature, take on a very macabre meaning for adults and youngsters alike. The struggles with growing up, the drug-pedaling gangsters taking lives and the simple meaning of the word family all come together to remind how easy it is to feel like a nobody in today's society. This film should be the example that prospective filmmakers follow to ensure they produce good quality, well-written and acted pieces of brilliance. Cleverly bordering on juvenile and downright grotesque, Kick-Ass delivers a very poignant message to its audience: stand up for what you believe in – and although it doesn't contain any real superheroes, this is easily the best superhero film out there.<br/><br/>Having my own personal history of playing with weapons, I can easily tell you that anyone with a penchant for martial arts (or ass-kicking) will immediately fall for this little beauty. That said, it's not solely aimed at the fighters amongst you. There's a child in it, for one. An ass-kicking child, but a child nonetheless; one that will probably shove a heap of wind up your rear pipe if you're one of those people that think children should be wrapped in cotton wool. Or that children shouldn't be commended for fighting or using weaponry. If you find yourself falling into one of these categories, please stay away from this production. And don't be fooled by the little purple-haired wonder either – she'll break you and the horse you rode in on."

","Well, what can I say. This was a great film. Very unexpected ending. The build up was immense. I enjoyed the sarcastic lines given to the actor playing kick ass, they made you really not expect anything quite as big as what happened. I think the acting throughout was pretty damn amazing. The young actress playing hit girl I feel was exceptional, right up there with Dakota Fanning. The music picked for the film fitted brilliantly, using the pretty reckless at the end, good call, love them. The special effects were well done, I couldn't spot any flaws. The only criticism I have is that I have to wait to see the sequel. I'd definitely recommend this film to any of my friends. 10/10 :D."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","4","10","20 April 2010"," Has something new to offer in a familiar genre
","For the audience, it takes a little while to get the right balance between the various things this movie is: outlandish black comedy, blood-boiling action, subdues pathos and conventional melodrama.<br/><br/>The movie opens with parallel stories of two ""heroes"" which the audience obviously know that will converge. However, the convergence which comes quite early in the story is only a slight nod rather than an immediately alliance. The more conventional (if you can say that at all) is a girl, Hit Girl, trained to be a deadly Amazon and we've seen all that in Kill Bill. But when this girl is only 11 and throws around obscenities that make a sailor blush, you can't call that very conventional.<br/><br/>The other hero, the titular protagonist, is anything but conventional. Look at the simplest thing: his costume is a drab and ugly wetsuit. The ""birth"" of the hero is in his talking aloud to himself, asking why superheroes appear only in comic books and not real life. This high-school kid really walks the walk. But he has neither superpower (as does Superman) nor super wealth (as does Batman). He starts out his first mission with absolutely no special power. By the time he takes on his second one, he does have a certain kind of special power, and it is actually the consequence of the first one. He is almost fatally stabbed the first time and after the resultant surgery, has completely lost his ability to feel pain. So in the second time, the goons eventually leave him alone not out of fear or kindness, but simply because of lost of interest (there's no fun in beating up a sand bag). The third time he would have got himself killed but for Hit Girl, hence the convergence.<br/><br/>Hit Girl has been trained by his father Big Daddy (Nick Cage) and the vigilante team has quest of vengeance. This is basically it and do not expect much by way of unpredictability. The action however is tip-notch and has a kind of explosive atomic (meaning small) dynamic power coming from a four-foot-five (I guess) 11-year-old girl. Director Matthew Vaughn (""Stardust"" has turned this recent (2008) hot comic into something quite watchable with potentials for a franchise. Most recent milestone: #129 in IMDb's ""top 250"" and this week's box office leader."

Watchmen got 7.8 ? is this movie better ? First if this movie meant to be funny ""I know it's not"", then how ? none of the roles were funny, the actors performance was less than satisfactory including Nicolas Cage, except for the scene were he's on fire.<br/><br/>Now, if this movie meant to be inspirational movie, watching an 11 years old girl, and a couple of geeks, fighting mobs, is not an inspiration for the new generation to help people.

"Dandy_Desmond","1","5","14","11 September 2010"," Over hyped, trendy nonsense.
","I was very disappointed with kick ass. <br/><br/>Everyone who had seen it told me how good it was, that it was laugh out loud funny original etc and I liked the concept.<br/><br/>What I watched was a disjointed mess of a movie that didn't know if it was a comedy, action flick or comment on society. <br/><br/>We have what appears to be a comedy at the beginning, an ordinary boy with no superpowers who wants to do some good. Buys a horrible suit and wants to be a superhero. <br/><br/>So his first mission he confronts two men stealing a car then gets stabbed in the stomach? Was this meant to be funny? When he recovers he finds a girl he fancies at school thinks he is gay so he goes along with it (hilarious - laugh out loud? not really) and we meet a pre teen girl who says c*nt and c*ck a lot which again isn't really funny or original (see The Last Boy Scout - 1991).<br/><br/>So what is kick ass? I really don't know - I turned it off after an hour and I don't do that lightly. Either i was sold a different movie or sadly this appears to appeal to todays audience. Kids killing people and swearing. Cool! <br/><br/>It came highly recommended but I thought it stunk. <br/><br/>Obviously this must be what counts as comedy for todays young generation - sad cos there is not an original laugh in it."

"thesar-2","9","5","14","15 May 2010"," Kicked Watchmen's Ass!
","How dumb would it be to start my review with: Kick-Ass Kicked Ass! But it did. It's my highest rated movie (so-far) of 2010, so I have to start on a positive note, however obvious and clichéd.<br/><br/>This wildly original, exciting, funny and suspenseful movie is the movie I wanted to see in Watchmen. Both are HARD-R films, both are ADULT-oriented comic-book adventures and both involve a masked adventurer that's eerily too close to coping Batman. (In Kick-Ass's defense, they were trying to spoof, while Watchmen simply ripped Batman off.) But, only Kick-Ass succeeded in adding both fantasy and enjoyment, shock without revolting and dialogue worth quoting.<br/><br/>The movie starts brilliantly by telling you immediately this is the Family Guy of comic-book movies, orit looks like its good for kids, but far from it. (SEE: the ""leap of faith"" and Dave's (Johnson) first fantasy, prior to being a superhero.) He's just a normal, high-school geek, horny for girls (old and young alike) and have equally standing buddies. A la Peter Parker. His ""brilliant idea"" is to become a masked superhero, or ""Kick-Ass,"" to do what most people won't: help those in need or when attacked.<br/><br/>It doesn't go as planned, and they perfectly show the realism if this were to happen. All that happens to him during his ""training"" made me kept thinking these must be dreams, but they were for real.<br/><br/>Finally he gets his big break while somewhat fighting off three thugs and becoming an internet sensation. This prompts other ""superheroes"" to take to the streets, but with far greater motivations. Big Daddy (Cage) is the Batman-wannabe, and anyone that thinks he's a rip-off, think of the homage he's playing in addition to the refreshing site of someone that's playing the fake-Batman from The Dark Knight's opening: a gun totting and lethal/killer Batman. His daughter, Hitgirl (Moretz) has her own background story, but in the present she's a daddy's little girl and is perfectly willing to do anything he says or does when it comes to murder, death or slicing & dicing.<br/><br/>Eventually they meet, but Kick-Ass's over his head. He gets his girl and an Incredibles's Syndrome knockoff sidekick Red Mist (Plasse) with definite ulterior motives of his own. (If you caught the Syndrome reference, then you pretty much know what kind of character he is.) The movie certainly goes into familiar territory with the finale/outcome/climax, but since you already know what type of movie this is 10 minutes in, you can just sit back and enjoy the adventure and fun.<br/><br/>I did like Johnson as he did what he needed to in his role. Plasse showed again he had little range outside of his normal McLovin role from Superbad. So, if you like him in that role, you'll enjoy him here again. I'm not a Nicolas Cage fan, though I don't hate him or his acting. Here, I loved what he did with the faux-pas Batman, especially the voice.<br/><br/>While Cage stood out, but the number one star of the movie was Moretz. I heard a lot about her ""offensive"" and ""vulgar"" character prior. To me, she was wildly original and out-acted the entire cast with her depth and emotion. As realistic as most of the movie was, she was over-the-top, and that wasn't a bad thing. I enjoyed every second she was on screen, especially when she pulled off Kill Bill Vol. 1's Gogo Yubari role as the sweet little terror. (I also loved it when Puss In Boots did this in Shrek 2.) Recently I learned she is to play the main role in the Americanized remake Let Me In from the original Let the Right One In. I already looked forward to the reboot, but now I can't wait to see it.<br/><br/>As I've pointed out, there's tons of references (and probably dozens more I left out) to other films. I didn't have a problem with that. It was nice to see them all in a fresh and real-life setting. The movie blends what real kids do, i.e. Facebook.<br/><br/>I acknowledge the movie isn't perfect as there's a balance problem where they seemed like they had too many ideas on the table and the film moved from one mood to the next and sometimes without ease. In addition, it was easy to see how (most, not all) the scenes would play out. Nevertheless, I was entertained from the get-go and it never let up or let me down.<br/><br/>This is a highly recommended super-hero movie (It even had a great soundtrack) and I'm sad to see it didn't do well with the box office, though I understand it's definitely geared to a specific audience.<br/><br/>Side Note: I haven't had a feeling for a low-brow/Spring released movie like this since Lucky Number Slevin four years ago. Coincidentally, neither made the money they deserved and I make no apologies for the love I have for both of these movies. I felt both had great dialogue, humorous scenes, good action and most importantly for my taste: originality.<br/><br/>Side Note 2: Contradictory to my normal criticisms and reviews, I really enjoyed the character of Hitgirl. Normally, I'd be all over the abuse of a child and ranting about CPS, etc, but since pretty much her role was so wrapped in fantasy, it was easier to see her as fiction and not a child being put in such peril as would normally offend me."

"tom_owens_182","9","5","14","14 May 2010"," Without meaning to sound Clichéd, this film Kicked-Ass.
","Kick-Ass is by far not a normal superhero movie. First of all, there are no 'super'-heroes they are just normal people. All with motives and personal vendettas that are all perfectly explained through character development. Which is surprising when many characters are introduced as random points.<br/><br/>The Plot of Kick-Ass is fairly simple. Aaron Johnson plays David Lewizski, a typical teenager even described by himself as: ""just existing."" (As a small note, he is the perfect protagonist for the target audience of this film.) He spends the majority of his time reading comic books and fanatically talking about trivial activities and fantasising about his female teachers. Being such a comic fanatic, David ponders why no one has ever tried being a super-hero. His friends quickly respond by insisting that they would get their ass kicked. (A nice in Joke to the title.) Un-deterred, David pursues his dream and buys his own costume and weapons. And dubs himself under the pseudonym ""Kick Ass."" This provides the premise for the rest of the film which involves small time crooks and larger mafia style gang warfare. The result is something like Spiderman 2 combined with Pulp Fiction. And by the way, the film totally 'Kicks-Ass'.<br/><br/>The film has a gritty reality that is always present and constant during the course of the film. For example, during his first fight Kick Ass is stabbed and ran over. Rather than glamorising the life of a superhero it does quite the opposite by showing the harsh reality, pain and suffering. This is rather gruesomely shown in a scene in which Kick Ass and fellow superhero Bid Daddy are tortured by mobsters.<br/><br/>Although this is a radical step away from normal convention in superhero movies, and the juxtaposition of superhero and normal person is brilliantly portrayed, this is unfortunately a weak spot in the movie for me. The gritty reality and message is thrown upon the audience without knowing.<br/><br/>Think of it this way, the title ""Kick-Ass"" suggests a comic superhero movie that will predominately tongue in cheek. However, this film completely surprises you and offers no comedy but instead a torture scene comparable to perhaps reservoir dogs. It is like some kind of sick joke. The reaction of the people I saw this with were similar. How did this film become so dark humoured and taboo? Without saying too much, it is fair to say that there will almost certainly be a sequel to ""Kick-Ass"". The title? Perhaps ""Kick some more ass"". I don't know.<br/><br/>Whilst I recommend you watch this film, I seriously recommend you expect the unexpected. Some things may come as a surprise."
"andrewpoe","9","5","14","13 May 2010"," Great movie -- one of the best of this year
","As seems to be the standard now, I usually watch movies trying to avoid all marketing, reviews and press on them. I try to not view movies with the point of giving out 10's of 10 like candy (although some of my ratings indicate otherwise).<br/><br/>Yet with this movie I think it will be one of the best films this year....and I can actually see an Oscar nomination for Nicholas Cage with this. Really.<br/><br/>This movie although titled Kick-Ass is not about the title character at all. It's more about Cage's character (Big Daddy) and his daughter Mindy (Hit-Girl). The story in the movie does a great job at capturing little nuances -- when you first see Cage's character he is shooting a gun at his daughter. It actually feels a little 'thrown away' and you almost think that they aren't important to the movie. Then they reveal their alter-egos and fight alongside Kick-Ass who is going through a typical teenager story -- he meets a girl, he falls in love, and they have a relationship.<br/><br/>It's odd how this movie starts out like Superbad or Knocked Up and makes you think it's going to a crude humorous look at adolescence and a send-up of superhero/comic movies. But then it turns into something bigger. It turns into a great homage of Tarantino (the fight at the end with Hit-Girl), Michael Mann (Red Mist & Kick-Ass driving through the city is start out of Collateral, down to the lighting) and John Woo (the raid on D'Amico's lair and the scene in the warehouse).<br/><br/>But above all, you care about the characters, however minor and you care about the story. Nicholas Cage's character is the best I've ever seen him do and he needs to do more movies like this. Although the movie ends with the promise of a sequel, I actually hope there's not one. This movie's too perfect for that.<br/><br/>If you get a chance, see this or get it on DVD when it comes out."

","kick ass is a story of an average boy,living ordinary life without any real excitement(like me).one day he decides to become a super hero(kick ass) and the funny thing is that there is no motive and personal agenda behind him being a superhero, now that makes this movie different,every time there has been a reason for someone for being a superhero and they all have some extraordinary power or large amount of money to spend for a social service.<br/><br/>kick ass have lots of interesting characters but one that i liked most in the movie was of ""hit girl"".a 12 year girl abusing and killing brutally was really surprising for me.her character is necessary for movie as she played important part in achieving the purpose of the movie.you don't have to think about movie and it's character after,as it is just a fun ride to entertain people and violence,profanity and hit-girl played a important part in it.<br/><br/>kick ass is very original,a new way making a movie on comic and graphic novel.kick ass will prove a pioneer in the start of new era of movies, a totally new genre(like western movie genre of 60's) of comic book adaptations filled with lots of stylish bloody violence,lots of fun and profanity.<br/><br/>kick ass is a movie that doesn't convey any message,you don't have to think about the movie seriously.this is just a fun ride and this is what today's generation want.they want just fun to leave all the tension behind and this movie succeeded in this purpose completely.<br/><br/>many peoples is disappointed with extreme use of violence and profanity in movie,they are right on their behalf.but i liked this movie because this movie succeeded in its purpose completely and give me a ride that i wanted from this movie."
"anujkumar-v","10","5","14","10 May 2010"," Eye-Popping...Jaw-Dropping...Nail-Biting...KICK-ASS!
","Never was a movie so worth the wait, so nail-bitingly exciting and fun, so ...Well I watched it thrice in just as many couple of hours, so that should just about say it all.Seriously though, this movie kicks some serious ass. Although I'm not quite sure about the title. Aaron Johnson as Kick-Ass is okay, but Chloe Grace-Moretz as Hit-Girl was the life of the show. Kicking, stabbing, shooting and swearing her way through bad guys, she kinda reminds one of a young Natalie Portman in Leon(another great movie. Nicholas Cage as Big-Daddy ain't bad either.Although I hadn't read the original comic series by Millar(I'm gonna!), I thoroughly enjoyed it. A must-see for all comic-book fans. Kick-ass is that perfect summer blockbuster we've all been waiting for. Ten on Ten!"
"nightixu","5","5","14","1 May 2010"," Kick-Ass fails at everything but has great actions scenes.
","On first impression, kick ass looks a little bit like a parody of superheroes which i think it ultimately is, albeit a more serious parody. I was really moved by the beginning of the movie where the hero kick-ass, played by Aaron johnson, is upset with the world as they let crime go unpunished even as it happened right in front of them. Being a comic book nerd that he is, he acts on his initiative and orders a wetsuit online for his superhero costume and thus, kick-ass is born. The beginning was definitely kick-ass. But the plot,story and my attention starts to disintegrate after that. <br/><br/>I didn't get to like any of the characters that much except for big daddy and hit-girl. They're actually more kick-ass than kick-ass himself. In fact, those 2 are the ONLY THINGS in the movie that makes kick-ass KICK ASS. The story does not have a cohesive flow. More like a jumbled mix. In my opinion, the story would have been nicer if it followed Big daddy and hit-girl and they were the actual main characters. The movie does give you a few laughs here and there but it doesn't fully deserve to be called funny. <br/><br/>You just sort of lose focus after awhile because there are too many things happening and it doesn't have that emotional pull. In the end, you feel like the movie barely accomplished anything. Once again, if the story had followed big daddy and hit-girl, it would have meant something. Kick-ass was a sideshow small fry throughout the movie. And you really expected great things from him. And that line he gave before he finished off the main antagonist was so cheesy. It was actually pretty gutsy for a wimpy small fry.<br/><br/>Overall, through kick-ass side of the story, you get more hilarious, a bit touching and romance thing. For big daddy and hit-girl, you get sweet loving family, REAL kick ass fight scenes and emotional sad parts. The 2 stories clash which makes it a jumbled mess. Sort of like trying to be serious and funny with romance on the side and betrayal but fails horribly.<br/><br/>The fight scenes were really great! I'd say the fight scenes alone was what made up my rating of 5 stars. It was slick, stylish and gratifying. Very violent and graphic as well. Only thing that made the movie worth watching to me. I'm sure the comic book was awesome but the movie sucked."
"virindra","10","5","14","25 April 2010"," Second half was awesome!
","I just came from the cinema and watched this movie. The first half was not so terrific. The story was built up slowly. The reality of life, that almost everyone dreams to be a superhero was shown very clever. Real life ain't that great.<br/><br/>Aaron Johnson played the nerd very well and during the movie he didn't change a bit. He played his role very good. Nicolas Cage was just good. I don't know why they didn't cast Gary Busey for the role as Big daddy. Maybe the moviemaker wanted to add a big name to the movie. A pity, Gary would have been a better pick.<br/><br/>The cherry on the pie was Chloe Moretz. This young girl owned the movie. What a great performance she gave us. Such bolt and horrific scenes she played in.<br/><br/>The action was great, new. Humor was O.K. The best part of the movie for me was the silent before the storm (dutch saying) where Cage, Moretz and Johnson prepares themselves for ""the big fight"". And then... there came a lot of fantastic action! Background music was fantastic, wonderful.<br/><br/>Christopher Mintz-Plasse gave a great performance and at the ending he suggested there could be a sequel for this movie. Please don't, unless it will be better that this movie. But I don't think that is possible.<br/><br/>Great work guys... and especially the little girl."
"Fused0ne","10","6","18","18 April 2010"," Kick-Ass was just that, a Kick-Ass movie! Must see.
","I went into this moving thinking OK, it will be awesome, or it will suck. There was no in between here in my mind, either one or the other. Let me say I was glad when I realized IT WAS AWESOME. My 18yr old sister, and my 11yr old nephew, and I (26 yr old female), went and saw this opening day... we also saw Death at a Funeral too afterwords. Both of these movies were great, and in fact Kick-Ass had more people in the theater than Death at a Funeral. The theater was oddly empty for a Friday actually, and I think that has to do with the low numbers for Kick-Ass. Maybe ticket prices going up? Maybe something on TV? I don't know, but I do know, well believe, (yes I use comma's a lot), that Kick- Ass is one of those movies that people think is stupid, but through word of mouth from those who did go see it, it will make more the next weekend than the opening weekend. Yes it was odd, it had some shocking scenes, I had never read the comic, didn't even know about it, so a lot of what I saw in the movie was like, ""WOW I can't believe they just did that! I can't believe what I am seeing,"" typed of shock. Yes I did cover my nephew's eye's in any scene with less clothes that I would like him to see, but as for the violence, etc, its 2010, he's not a baby, he knows its fake, and he knows a movie is just that a movie. He's been going to the movies just about every week since I can remember. Those who may think certain scenes involving the actress who plays Hit Girl shouldn't have been made, or were too strong, etc, get over it. She's an actress, remember The Good Son? How about Village of the Damned? This movie has jaw dropping action, hilarious scenes that make you laugh, scenes that make you think WTF?! It has everything, and its great. Go see this! I don't know if anything in this, is spoilerish but to be safe, I checked the Contains spoiler box."
"woodennature","9","6","18","16 April 2010"," Refreshingly wicked superhero satire with epic action sequences
","After films like Spiderman 3, Fantastic 4, Superman Returns which were all so-so and the incredibly stupid Hulk movies , I was thinking Hollywood had pretty much reached saturation point in superhero movies.<br/><br/>Then came Kick-Ass. What can I say? I didn't have a high expectation of this film. The trailer gave me the impression that it is going to be just another forgettable cheap thrill. Oh was I ever so mistaken.<br/><br/>Kick-Ass was awesome! The politically incorrect tone of the whole show stands itself out from all other politically correct superhero movies. Have you seen spandex wearing superheroes brandishing guns killing, swearing, knife-fighting thugs?<br/><br/>Comic book patronage is also apparent in the whole film, with comic book culture never before looked so cool (hanging out in comic book stores, coffee shops) and the characters are all somewhat into comic books (Aaron Johnson's character and his friends are comic book geeks, Katie is 'comic-book-curious', Big Daddy creates a comic book for his daughter Hit Girl and draws Frank D'Amico and his top dogs in a comic book fashion). Plenty of references to other comic book superheroes (no power comes no responsibility) or poking fun at comic book clichés is pretty much the backbone of the comedy element, although you don't have to be hardcore comic book geeks to understand the humour, it's pretty general. The funny deliberate corny monologues of the characters, comic-book styles during some change of scenes like 'Meanwhile...' tabs and bright colours and short comic-book styled animation / flashback on the origin of Hit Girl and Big Daddy are also part of the comic book patronage in this film.<br/><br/>Additionally the widespread use and influential power of Youtube and MySpace by both the protagonists (Dave uses MySpace to create a profile for Kick-Ass and states in the movie he has only 38 friends in his real page but hundreds of thousands on his Kick-Ass page shows that a modern update on a common element in superheroes, a 'two faced nature' of superheroes like 'Bruce Wayne by day, Batman by night'. Amatueur footage of Kick-Ass got uploaded on Youtube became a sensation and led Big Daddy and Hit Girl to discover Kick-Ass) and antagonists (D'Amico used Youtube to stream live footage of Big Daddy and Kick-Ass' torture) as the main channels of information on us makes the film current and realistic and for that, we can associate better with the characters as the film is brought down to our level. The Youtube element is something the parody 'Superhero Movie' also did, but Kick-Ass just refashioned it and took it to the next level.<br/><br/>The show has some of the most memorable and lasting action sequences, similar to the style of Kill Bill with a good combination of adrenaline, refreshing retro-pop music that sets the mood of the scene and satisfying choreography that we have never seen before.<br/><br/>The characters are great in the film. Dave leads the film in his Spiderman like narrative in the first half of the film in a satirical fashion. Nicholas Cage as Big Daddy is also something to take note of, a doting father. The one who steals the spotlight is really Chloe Moretz's Hit Girl character, who has a penchant for fancy switchblades and colourful language (like the adults around her), is a real break from the last time I saw her as a supporting role as Tom's mature sister in (500) Days Of Summer. She leads most of the seriously breathtaking action sequences, and has the best lines other than Kick-Ass. She is much like Matilda in the Luc Besson film Leon, but with more attitude, wit, and skill of a true original female child action hero (first of her kind in Hollywood?). The schoolgirl lobby scene also had similarities from the Japanese manga and anime Gunslinger Girl which also featured kick-ass gun-totting little girls. In fact, Kick-Ass becomes pretty much the clumsy comedic sidekick next to all the Hit Girl scenes after the first half of the show, despite being the main character. <br/><br/>However, unlike the rich characters of Dave/Kick-Ass, and the Big Daddy and Hit Girl duo, I felt D'Amico was too thinly developed on, which I felt could add to some depth if the script would allow him to (like why he entered the business of drug trafficking or a history behind his former coke addiction) and not strip him down to such a stereotypical bad guy. Red Mist as D'Amico's son's character should also be developed on his loneliness, his refuge in a world of comic books and the ever-driven need for self-worth that eventually made him become Red Mist.<br/><br/>In any case, this film is generally a great film with a bucket of popcorn and some good friends. It is definitely one film you should catch in a cinema any time soon. And as for me, I have got to start checking out the Kick-Ass comic book this movie was based on."

","Kick-ass is an awesome movie which i find one of my favourite of all time.<br/><br/>With its sense of humour which can be funny, even though i'd class it more of a serious action movie then comedy which most people seem to see it as. It even has great actors like Nicolas Cage who has starred in many other successful films. <br/><br/>He plays a superhero in this a called 'Big Daddy' who funnily enough looks like batman and is mentioned as batman in the movie.<br/><br/>And then there's Chloe Grace Moretz who plays as a superhero called 'Hit girl' whom i find pretty damn hot and fights better then any other character in this film."
"asda-man","9","3","7","28 September 2011"," Kicked arse
","I wasn't expecting to like ""Kick-ass"". Why did you buy it then? I hear you cry! Well, because ""Stella"" was doing this fantastic offer where you can choose from 40 DVD's and get one for the price of a text (which is only 10p or so woohoo! P.S. There are other great alcoholic beverages apart from ""Stella""). So I thought ooh, I'll try this one even though I'm probably going to absolutely hate it even though loads of people say it's great. It turns out that I absolutely loved it and by the end of it I was quoting Lynne, ""FANTASTIC, LOVED IT! LOVED IT!"" Whilst nodding my body like one of those desktop bird things. Anyway, you won't know what I'm on about because I don't even know myself.<br/><br/>Now I've rabbited on for a whole paragraph about nothing really so let's get on to the film. I was scared that i wasn't going to like it because A. I don't like superheroes, B. It's in-your-face awkward yanky humour that's portrayed on the TV spots won't be to my taste C. I hate comic adaptations (hello ""Watchmen"") and D. Nicholos Cage is in it. Thankfully all of these letters were not a problem one bit. ""Kick-ass"" should be commended for its inability to portray something that seems completely believable but at the same time be incredibly outrageous, like ""The human Centipede 2"". I was really impressed with how gorgeously the film was written (by Johanathan Woss' wife no less, she's obviously got more talent than him... Bloody busy body) it had a fantastic story to tell which blends humour, action and brilliant characters almost perfectly.<br/><br/>""Kick-ass"" was also exactly my humour. As soon as Nicholas Cage shot his daughter in the chest I knew this film was going to be fine-diddly-ine. ""Kick-ass"" is really funny at times, and most importantly at the appropriate times. It keeps it's entertaining story and action sequences separate from the humour so that it doesn't become too over-powering and interferes with the story.<br/><br/>""Kick-ass"" did kind of seem reminiscent of ""Watchmen"", it's almost as if this is what ""Watchmen"" should've been. Because whereas ""Watchmen"" is a dreary, pathetic yarn which takes itself way, way, way too seriously. ""Kick-ass"" is an hour and 50 minutes of pure entertainment, it's never boring and is always engaging and exciting. i really didn't want it to end with it's incredible action sequences and brilliantly drawn characters. The directing was really impressive and almost Quentin Tarantino-esque as it did have that ""Kill Bill"" kind of quality to it.<br/><br/>""Kick-ass"" may also seem very kiddish on the cover but please don't let this anywhere near young viewers. It really doesn't hold back on its insane violence and profanity's. ""Kick-ass"" did get a hard time in the press because of Hitgirl who's basically a mini Uma Thurman from ""Kill Bill"". They didn't think it was appropriate to let a child swear and assassinate so many people, but you know what? It's all a bit of fun, and people should open there eyes and not take life quite so seriously.<br/><br/>Like I said, ""Kick-ass"" is the complete opposite to what i thought it would be. I never thought that I'd be sitting here giving it a 10/10 and glowing report. It is perfect in a way. It's directed brilliantly, written fantastically, it has a fabulous soundtrack as well as characters we can all care about. ""Kick-ass"" is pure entertainment and is the ultimate experience in fun as well as having an interesting story put there. If you thought you'd never like it, give it a go."
"jonmurphy54","10","3","7","28 July 2011"," Surprising and perfect!
","Before i saw this movie, i had heard that it was simply a gory teenage action flick. Usually I'm cool with that so i decided that it would be fun. Plus, who doesn't like the loser turned awesome story? As iwatched this film it reminded me of one person: Quentin Tarantino. The score was perfect given the circumstances in a twisted way, the gore and action was over stylized as if it was to look unreal, the story was offbeat and fun and definitely clever. I've been a big fan of the works of Tarantino, and watching this movie made me realize what it would be like if i watched a superhero movie done by him.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie was very solid. Nicholas Cage temporarily got out of his ""dud after dud"" funk with a solid performance, Mclovin did his dorky thing, and Aaron Johnson shows a very promising future with his role. The real star of this film, however, is Chloe Grace Mortez. Although her performance was dubbed ""inappropriate"", i can't help but think Hollywood needs to lighten up and realize a fantastic performance when it is given! <br/><br/>To sum this film up, i can only say one thing that will apply to everyone, whether you take it positively or negatively: You will never look at a Superhero movie the same ever again."

Nicholas Cage does an amazing job of acting, like always, and really pulls you into the story. and whoever the kid who plays kick-ass himself is, he deserves an award because he did fantastically. <br/><br/>now, this film was nominated for a few trophies at the scream awards, but, due to all the little weird goth kids, only queer movies dealing with vampires won anything. so i was very disappointed about that because i was sitting on the edge of my seat, hoping this film would win something.<br/><br/>its very good to finally see that a film i like gets an honest rating.<br/><br/>i only gave this 9 stars instead of 10 mainly because some of the 3d compositing in the film looks a tad bit cheesy. but, it still looks good. not incredibly noticeable.<br/><br/>all in all, this is a fantastic film that I'm sure you will very much enjoy"

","My friend told me to watch this film, saying that it was hilarious, so I thought why not. I have to agree with her, it was hilarious. I thought that it had a great story-line and some very good character development. Aaron Johnson fitted Dave/Kick-Ass' character perfectly, but I would say that Chloe Moretez stood out most to me, as she delivered a very believable performance. Yes, this film was rude but I don't think that it was inappropriate as sex wasn't the main feature of the film. Overall I would say that Kick-Ass is a very good film, not for the faint hearted but funny never-the-less I would rate it 9/10 and say that it is suitable for anyone mature 13+."

It was on Cox Communications Epix Chanel 309. If you haven't watched it, definitely check it out. Makes me want more... ready for an Encore... AWESOME! I couldn't leave my seat to get a drink or go to the bathroom it was that good. Kind of made me wish for a commercial or at least I wish I had been prepared to sit for the movie to say the least.

"sonofocelot-1","9","3","7","21 February 2011"," The most surprised I've ever been at a film.
","When I saw the ad campaign over here in England, it was marketed as just the sort of film I'd turn my nose up at and wouldn't take any notice of. The campaign showed the 2 or 3 slapstick or obviously funny moments from the film, and I immediately dismissed it as being another ""Wedding Crashers"" or ""Step Brothers"" type film. That's why I saw it a whole 2 months after release. I'd heard good things about it from a few friends so thought I'd give it a go.<br/><br/>This film is just stunning. It's the antithesis to the dark knight, which I kind of enjoyed, but it is the most over-rated film of all time. This is possibly the most under-rated. There have only been a handful of films that have gone any sort of distance to changing me as a person, and it seems odd to be putting this film in the same venn diagram as the likes of the Shawshank Redemption, Fight Club etc... but as the end credits rolled, I was left with that numb feeling I live for, and found myself thinking about my own life, and what it could be.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen Kick-Ass, that's going to seem like a chronic exaggeration, but in my opinion, it deserves everything I've just written plus more.<br/><br/>Kick-Ass just has everything. Some of the best direction I've seen in years from Matthew Vaughn, who is hardly a familiar face in the film industry, which just sings his praises even more. When you add to that some genius camera-work, a script that grabs you by the nuts from scene one and doesn't let go, and some terrific acting (particularly from newcomer Chloe Moretz as the oh so lovable but oh so vicious hit-girl), and also one of my favourite ever soundtracks from John Murphy, Ilan Eshkeri, and others, you've really got a quite frankly stunning film.<br/><br/>If you read this and go and watch Kick Ass, you may not enjoy it as much as I did, but I defy anyone to sit through it's 2 hour duration without laughing, crying, shouting, or just smiling at it's sheer epicness. I did all 4.<br/><br/>Any film that makes me leave the cinema and want to ditch my profession to fight crime in my town gets my vote. Absolutely brilliant."

To start with this film is so amazing it has its own style that appeals to almost everyone;everyone can relate to this film in some way whether it being you wished you could be a superhero when you were a kid or the average teenagers life that you once had.<br/><br/>Anyway this is a superhero film that takes the element of realism and turns it inside out so its graphic realism.<br/><br/>Anyway the basic plot is that Dave poses the question ""Why doesn't anybody try to be a superhero?"" and I think all of us can answer that question; Because you will be killed instantly!The film has Dave becoming the superhero ""Kick-Ass"" and eventually he takes on a pair of petty crime thugs with knives single handed. But he ends up getting stabbed. This part of the movie can create big questions in the viewers head like ""If you were a superhero and you got stabbed like that would you need things like physiotherapy?"".<br/><br/>Anyway the film gradually progresses and Kick-Ass meets ""Hit-Girl"" and ""Big-Daddy"" a pair of superheroes that fight crime by using weapons such as guns and blades. But when this point happens in the film it opens up the other characters side of the story and begins the ""Multiple storyline"" stage. This was done superbly (Much unlike Spiderman 3).<br/><br/>The characters were well played, but there was only 1 character that developed during the course of the movie and that was Dave but that doesn't matter.<br/><br/>And the music just literally KICKED ASS!Listen to the score for the Hit girl rescue scene.<br/><br/>The film starts off funny and comical but after the death of Big-Daddy ,in one of the most epic scenes in action film history, the film takes a theme of seriousness and revenge and it is just awesome.<br/><br/>As I said before this film was amazing you might even say it Kicks Ass! Anyway this film is a must-see for everyone as it appeals to almost everyone! BRING ON KICK-ASS 2:BALLS TO THE WALL!!!!!!!!! GO AND WATCH IT!"

","Kick ass is a movie about a guy with no superpowers trying to be a superhero. I have to say that this movie s hilarious. The main characters are Big Daddy, Hit Girl, Kick-Ass, and The Red Mist. They are all fine, but my favorite is Hit Girl. She is 11 years old, and she hits, swears, and kills. What more can you ask from a little girl. However the red mist was a really boring character, but the actor did an awesome job portraying he mean and rich bad kid. Next I have to say this was one of Nicolas Cage's best performance ever. What I love about this movie is that it has violence yet it is still interesting to see. The music used fits perfectly with each scene. Yet, this movie is rated R for a reason, but even with that rating, the movie is awesome. A must rent, because you wouldn't want kids watching this movie. I can't wait for the sequel!"
"griffinfinity","8","3","7","17 September 2010"," Kid Kicks-Ass, boy does SHE kick-ass!
","The great thing about movies that enter the realm of super heroes is that nothing is over the top. Anything goes, and that is precisely why I read comics while growing up. The sixties were a different era of course, and I could only afford new books on Saturday. But I spent the entire afternoon reading them. It was a time to let the imagination roam unfettered. Time would seem as if suspended while I studied and imagined the world beyond a single frame or page. So with 'Kick-Ass', I did exactly as I did so many years ago. Sit back and hopefully, watch in awe.<br/><br/>The movie opens slowly, and a foundation is laid out. This is very important due to many not having read the 'Kick-Ass' series. I had never heard of it. But the premise intrigued me and that was enough. So, in a sense, I was back to the Saturday afternoon atmosphere of seeing things for the first time, as they unfolded. And unfold they did.<br/><br/>The rise of 'Kick-Ass' was due to frustration with the status-quo. You don't have to be into comics to understand this. However, it is the second ingredient to becoming 'Kick-Ass' (courage) that is uncommon. So young Dave (Aaron Johnson) has decided to change his world and the catalyst is the comic book super hero world he lives for. He creates an alter-ego 'Kick-Ass' and sets out to make a difference in his world. Along the way, he'll meet allies, adversaries and find that recognition can be a two-edged sword.<br/><br/>Each page of 'Kick-Ass' yields additions to the film that are a surprise and very welcome. Christopher Mintz-Plasse is fine as the ignored son of the local mob boss (Mark Strong) who reckons he'll be reckoned with one way or another. Nicholas Cage plays a comic book writer who has the added task of raising a daughter (Chloe Grace Moretz) alone. Chloe is a young dynamo who also happens to steal the movie (apologies to all the talent assembled, she is that good). I'm not getting into the characters here because you really need to watch the movie and let the story evolve.<br/><br/>The film is based on the Mark Millar comic book series. The writers worked closely with Millar . And for their efforts to bring forth a fresh and lively story to an old genre, writer Jane Goldman and writer-director, Matthew Vaughn have succeeded wildly. Oh and there will be more of these movies to come, that you can be sure of. After all, there's a charismatic thirteen year old girl who simply must entertain the world, one more time before getting back to school."
"estebangonzalez10","9","3","7","16 September 2010"," Superoheroes without Superpowers
","¨ Had I ever been a real super hero? The most I'd ever had to offer the world was good intentions and a slightly elevated capacity to take a kicking. With no power comes no responsibility, except that wasn't true. ¨ (9/10) Director Matthew Vaughn has done a fantastic job once again directing this super hero movie, where these heroes actually don't have anything super about them. This is Vaughn's third feature film after directing Stardust and Layer Cake, and both films were received warmly by the critics and audiences alike. I have to admit that I really loved this ultra-violent movie and was really entertained throughout the entire film. Hit-Girl makes Beatrix Kiddo from Kill Bill look like an amateur. Of course we don't have the Tarantino dialogue with this film, but the action and the performances are highly entertaining. Jane Goldman and Matthew Vaughn adapted the screenplay from Mark Miller's comic book of the same name. Miller's previous comic book, Wanted, was also made into a film starring Angelina Jolie, but I think Kick-Ass is far more superior and probably one of my favorite movies of the year. Yes, the violence is gratuitous and the language is strong, but watching this 11 year old girl fighting all these criminals is just priceless. She steals every scene she is in. This is not your regular super hero movie and definitely not one you will want to miss because it is an extremely fun ride. In my opinion Kick-Ass is last year's Zombieland combining violence with comedy. Many people were turned down by the violence and the language in this movie, so I know it is not for everyone, but I think that what Matthew Vaughn did in this film was just brilliant, and one can tell he is influenced by his close friend Guy Ritchie.<br/><br/>Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) is an ordinary kid who isn't very popular in school. He hangs around with two of his close friends, Marty (Clark Duke, Hot Tub Machine) and Todd (Evan Peters), reading and visiting comic book stores. Dave begins to wonder why no one decides to become a super hero and fight crime. Despite not having any special powers or any fighting abilities whatsoever he decides to become a masked vigilante and calls himself Kick-Ass. One day while he is on his super hero duty he encounters a couple of thieves and tries to stop them from stealing a car. Kick-Ass gets seriously injured and ends up in a hospital. Several metal plates are put in his body due to all his fractures, and they actually make him a little more resistible to punches. Little does Dave know that there actually two other masked vigilantes with vast experience on fighting organized crime. Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) and his highly trained eleven year old daughter, Hit-Girl (Chloe Moretz) have been fighting against a mafia boss named Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong, Sherlock Holmes). One day the three masked heroes meet and they give Kick-Ass some advice on the business. Kick-Ass seems to have inspired other people to become super heroes and suddenly there is a new one in the streets who calls himself Red Mist (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) and is actually Frank's son. None of these super heroes actually have any special power and the violence begins to escalate as the movie progresses, but always combining it with a great dose of comedy.<br/><br/>The true star of the film is Chloe Moretz who plays the eleven year old Hit-Girl who is highly trained in fighting and instead of playing with dolls, she plays with knives. She is just fun to watch on screen and one of my new favorite characters. Nicolas Cage is also good playing the eccentric Big Daddy and Aaron Johnson is great in the lead role. Kick-Ass can be compared to Clive Owen's Shoot Em Up because of all the cartoonish violence on screen, but I found it more similar to Kill Bill, although with a much more climatic ending. I found the dialogue to be quite funny and mixed well with the action scenes. The movie isn't deep and you probably can't get anything out of it, but it is highly entertaining and such a fun experience. I haven't been this entertained in a long time and Kick-Ass is one of those movies I wouldn't mind watching over and over again. I definitely recommend this film and know it will be hard to top entertainingly wise.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"

I didn't like how it started off so dirty. I didn't like how gross it was. But I laughed a lot. And it's pretty daring. I say it's daring because of the performance by Chloe Moretz. And Nociolas Cage. They were fantastic. The best thing about the film.<br/><br/>I don't think it deserves to be on the Top 250. I liked it. Or I liked most of it. It has a few flaws.

"jzappa","8","3","7","16 July 2010"," The Starting Pitcher of Young Guy Movies in 2010
","Watching Kick-Ass, we realize other films are working at one quarter speed. We've seen so many superhero movies. Especially after the Dark Knight watershed, Hollywood's as crazed in its search for comic-book options as Dobbs was in his search for gold in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre. We feel we're familiar with all the angles on the genre, but then comes this movie, itself a comic book adaptation, about several superheroes, that, very simply, does it better. It's fresh. It doesn't spoof or satirize; it just plays an original tune with all the same notes. It's directed by Matthew Vaughn, who produced Guy Ritchie's hyperkinetic thug films, but directed Layer Cake. So we wonder, who was learning from who? Kick-Ass tells the basic story of the Ordinary Teenager, who wonders why nobody's ever decided to become a superhero like the ones in his comics. The reasons are obvious, but when you're one of those invisible kids in high school, your big pipe dreams begin to be your plot to prove yourself. So he decides to become a real-life superhero himself, despite having no powers or training in the least. The movie does not shy away from realistic ramifications of fantastical encounters, and during his first attempt to fight crime by trying to stop a carjacking by two local thugs, he's indeed beaten, stabbed, and even hit by a car. He's hospitalized, convinces medics to say nothing of his costume, to say he was brought in naked. But now some of his nerve endings are damaged, giving him a slightly enhanced capacity to endure pain, metal plates have been placed in his skeleton to sustain his bones.<br/><br/>The assigned villains of the story are big-city Mafiosi, led by Mark Strong, returning to the role he unreservedly plays best, the tough, dominant boss who doesn't mind getting his hands dirty. Christopher Mintz-Plasse is his son, who gets his own drivers, bodyguards, respect. Mintz-Plasse is the rare character actor iho's so naturally funny that the first time we see him, I started to laugh, even though he's not doing anything really. There's just something about his look and manner; he's like Woody Allen for our generation. He becomes Red Mist, Kick-Ass's ridiculous yet cunning costumed nemesis.<br/><br/>The charm of this movie is the interweaving of so many rich superhero characters into a fast-moving but expansive plot with a cheerfully tasteless sense of cruel humor. I'm of course speaking mainly of the father-daughter crime-fighting team of Hit-Girl and Big Daddy. We're introduced to them when he promises to reward her with ice cream after a training session involving shooting her point-blank while wearing a bulletproof vest. She masters the martial arts possibly more than any movie fighter of any age I can recall. She's particularly skilled with lethal knife-throwing, and is rewarded a foot-long knife by Dad somewhat like a samurai is rewarded a special sword by his sensei. She fearlessly confronts a hallway filled with gun-sporting gangsters, shoots, stabs and beats them all to death. The movie's not taking the easy way out: They don't wail on the floor; she brutally takes their lives, apparently experiencing no emotions about it. She uses heavyweight profanity like a Guy Ritchie thug, and is the toughest, most effective character in the whole story. This is ballsy, fresh and reactionary comedy.<br/><br/>Outside of the superhero and mob characters, all of whom are richly and colorfully defined, the movie is nevertheless just as guilty as the next mainstream movie of not having any clue how to portray high school kids. I'm told that in Mark Millar's original comic, the girl of Kick-Ass's dreams goes from uninterested to appalled when he reveals his secret identity. That'd perfectly befit the film's disregard for the easy way out, which allows it to be so fresh and intriguing. But Hollywood won't have it, as in the most unreasonably stupid scene, he breaks into her room, explains his deceptions and in a completely implausible turn they begin having passionate dirty sex. However, where this would normally sever a movie from my engrossment, this one's working at such a vigorous frequency that I remained interested in its explosive set pieces and ink-black humor.<br/><br/>Perhaps it only seems smarter than it is: There's a scene where Vaughn confidently demonstrates a knowledge of what the audience already knows, where Strong, and we, see Kick-Ass walking down the street from behind, he follows him, eagerly attacks him, all of which occurs without ever giving us exactly what we suspect, but what's more admirable even then is how Vaughn never found it necessary to show the face of the phony Kick-Ass; he knows we know it's not actually him. However, it's never elucidated how they find out later that the Kick-Ass imposter who they attacked was only an imitator and not the actual Kick-Ass. If nobody's aware of who Kick-Ass really is up to that point, how do they know the imposter wasn't the actual Kick-Ass? Well, at any rate, it's difficult not to have fun at this movie."

","I got to say I was pleasantly shocked when I saw this movie. So, far it stands in my opinion, to be one of the best Comic book movies out there (next to Iron Man).<br/><br/>Most comic book based movies always try to over commercialize. Trying to get the most money by appealing to all ages, as a result having to be rated G. That's what makes Kick Ass special. I really did appreciate how true to the Comic it was (sister a comic buff as reference). Things that did differ from the comics only enhanced the movie, and overall story, for the best. It was dirty, sexual, violent as all hell and you would be a horrible parent to take your 10 year old to this movie (yes, parents did to it and walked out 10 mins into it). As a result it was REAL.<br/><br/>Probably one of the best aspects of the movie was majority of the acting and fight scenes. I will just name my favorites. Chloe Moretz aka Hit Girl is fu*king brilliant in this movie. Her acting as a 10 year old is so convincing, as well as her sudden bad ass persona as Hit Girl. She gets tons of props from me for all the physical aspects of her role. Moretz as Hit Girl has been the best casting I've ever seen for a superhero. She is honestly the heroine I never got growing up. I am not a big Nick Cage fan but he played Big Daddy fabulously. His and Moretz's quirky relationship as father and daughter is both endearing yet powerful. Best father and daughter duo! Christopher Mintz-Plasse aka Red Mist was loads of laughs and it was nice to see him in a different role, yet with the same Mintz-Plasse flare. Clark Duke aka Marty (Kick Asses friend) is hilarious as always, great comic relief, I would to see more of him in the next film. Surprisingly, Aaron Johnson aka Kick Ass, hardly made any impact on me as an actor. Yet, he was passable as Kick Ass, fitting the pathetic sorry persona, but then I feel that anyone could of played this character. His relationship w/ the character Katie, was funny then got stupid. The rest of the cast did decent to well enough to carry the story.<br/><br/>Overall, I am very impressed at this movie. The director worked closely with the creator of the comic to create this movie, which lead to an astounding outcome. Sure, it didn't do that well in Box office for opening, but that's cause it pushed the envelope of most comic movies. This movie deserves to be watched and recognized cause it's pretty bad ass."
"laurens_bosman","10","9","32","10 December 2009"," Surprisingly good 'superhero'-movie, if you liked Snatch, you'll love Kick-Ass!
","I was one of the lucky ones who was invited to the test-screening in Amsterdam.<br/><br/>Like most people I spoke after the movie, I was expecting an slightly amusing low quality comedy (that is probably what the title suggests). But I was blown away in the first 30 seconds of the film! Great camera-work, loved the soundtracks, acting was great considering the age and background of most actors! In my opinion it was one of the best performances of Nicolas in years, especially thanks to the chemistry between him and the little girl. The storyline was awesome! I really felt for the boy, and one moment you're laughing your ass of, the other moment you're blown away with amazing action shots with great violent humor! Which brings me to my statement: If you liked Snatch, you'll LOVE this movie!<br/><br/>The beginning was quite long, as mentioned in the comments before mine. But I couldn't think of one scene the movie could do without! Only the love between the boy and the girl was a bit strange. I don't know how to explain this without giving any spoilers, but in the beginning the girl seemed important. He was doing like everything to get her, but when he got her she was pushed to the background of the story very suddenly. Also the scene where he gets her felt a little cheap and unfinished. But this perhaps because the version I saw wasn't finished.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend this movie to everyone I know! 8/10"
"blazer_1704","9","6","19","25 April 2010"," Go See this Movie
","One of the best movies I have seen in probably 2 years. In the end I truly did like it more than Avatar.<br/><br/>The best part is I really did not know what was going to happen at every pivotal point in the movie. I won't get into any spoilers but you know some movies (IE. Green Zone) where you probably could script out the way the entire movie would play out after the first 20 minutes.... lets just say I did not know what would happen right down to the final scenes.<br/><br/>It is brutally violent and at the same time funny, seamlessly transitioning back and forth maintaining just enough humour to dictate the overall feel of the film into a .... not quite happy but certainly lighter tone. It's important they did that for it was a truly serious movie people would over analyze the hell out of it.<br/><br/>The actors were amazingly well cast and as many reviewers have already stated, they are really people you can emphasize with or at least relate to. The bad guys are actually seriously bad dudes.... its not a film in which the bad guys are just stupid and really not so bad in the end (IE. brutal Spider Man films)..... no they are actually kinda smart and people that will torture, kill, maim etc... Nicholas Cage as Big Daddy has his best role since his glory days of Face Off, Con Air, and The Rock.<br/><br/>Action scenes are incredible with three in particular.... The first major Kick Ass fight, Big Daddy's fight, and well several of Hit Girls with one in particular that you will know when you see it.<br/><br/>Its a full length two hour movie and honestly you wish it could have been 3 hours long because the script and story just meshed that well. Lots of action, lots of humor, good guys you really like and bad guys that are just as hilarious in their own brutal way.<br/><br/>A funny/serious action movie with a plot like no movie I've ever seen. Go see it."

The buttered popcorn was good, this film was GREAT!! The characters were well written and well acted, the script was human and very engaging, and the action was non-stop. The young actress who played Hit Girl made the movie for me, she was incredible. I laughed and cheered throughout the film. Please go see it, but please do not bring your little kids. It is fun and hilarious, but it is also brutally violent. Some of the parents in the theater had actually brought their small children to see the movie, and I thought that was a bad move.

","MMMmmm...NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNGAAAAHHHH!!!!!!<br/><br/>(Lights cigarette)<br/><br/>I want to marry this movie and have its children.<br/><br/>I would eat the corn out of this movie's s#!t.<br/><br/>What would happen if Quentin Tarantino directed Mystery Men and Sergio Leone directed The Dark Knight and the two films had a baby? I'm not sure but Kick-Ass would, erm, kick its ass. Finally Nicholas Cage is back to form and his hammery is totally intentional and well-placed here. Finally Christopher Mintz-Plasse' eternal portrayal of McLovin' finds a role it's as well-suited for as, well, McLovin's. And Chloe Moretz as Hit Girl not only steals the show but sells it back to its producers then comes back in the middle of the night and steals it again, then she comes down your chimney and leaves it on the cookie plate covered in peanut M&Ms, bacon, and the creamy white stuff that fills Twinkies. If Mathilda and Gogo Yubari somehow produced an offspring, Hit Girl would, ahem, kick its ass.<br/><br/>The movie is well-paced with ongoing comic relief, which is much welcomed between (and during) the numerous action sequences. Amazingly, each action set piece completely and utterly outdoes the previous one, whipping the viewer into an emulsion of frenzied froth until the climax, whence the weak of prostate may actually do so.<br/><br/>This may just be the best movie I've ever seen (so good that I am going to watch it again right after I get done typing this), and I've seen better movies than you have, so it's probably the best movie you'll ever see. So stop reading and go see it now."

","In a movie industry cluttered with own-grown hype, gimmicks and lack of idea, ""Kick Ass"" bursts onto the screen and shatters all expectations in it's wake. You're on this page because you think it's gonna be good? Wrong. Or you're here because you think it looks a decent or a good superhero movie to join the ranks of the ones you already love? DEAD wrong. Reason being, is ""Kick Ass""dozen't want to be good or above average, ""Kick Ass"" wants to be great and it has the balls to want to be original too. Seemingly impossible in a done to death genre where we've already glimpsed Mark Millar's signature style in ""Wanted"", but ""Kick Ass"" is all about the unexpected.<br/><br/>Make no mistake, nothing you believe of this movie compares to what Vaughn and co. serve up for you. Mainly because everyone involved seems determined to Honor the comic and redefine a genre. Most movies entertain, but this one? It wants to BLOW YOU AWAY! Less smarter movies have done that but ""Kick Ass"" ain't giving that up either. It's script is razor-sharp, dumping the pretension of ""the burden of heroism"" crippling even the better superhero films, showing this in actions rather than long drawn out emoting. Matthew Vaughn has finally solved the hurdle that all superhero movies suffer, namely how to get to know and love your characters without long drawn out scenes. He does it by keeping them moving. The more they do, the more they try, the more you know and love them. And make the narrative interesting and most of all ratable so we're with Dave 100% of the way, it dozen't just have to functional.<br/><br/>The real visual joy of ""Kick Ass"" is it's desire to keep it simple but not at the expense of wowing us. Make characters do cool things, instead of Michael Bay-esquire things happening to them. That's why they exude coolness, despite Dave's almost humdrum existence. This is the everyman doing the things we could do if wanted to; not a guy from another reality or possessed with great drive and ambition. Dave wants to get laid. He wants to be hip. Even your bad guy in this is believable. Watching the whirlwind that is Hit Girl perform a routine almost straight out of Jackie Chan's Hong Kong days stuns us in a way no big screen chase ever could. Visually the film takes all the thing we DID love from the movies that ultimately didn't zing and churns them into a finely balanced flawless brew.<br/><br/>Did I mention it's feel good? From it's inspired use of music (again utterly ratable) right down to it's outstanding score, like ""Get Carter"" for superheroes; I could say more but there's surprises in store.<br/><br/>In a movie this stunning, acting is usually secondary (as any James Cameron film shows). Not a bit of it. In a cast as eclectic as the styles the film embraces you have performances that set a benchmark for all concerned. Can Mark Strong already better his stellar work? See his menacing and humorous turn as D'Amico, a career best. Christopher Mintz Plasse follows ""Role Models"" by breaking out of McLovin mode. His guy has layers and he can show them. Nicolas Cage as expected returns to his past glories playing larger than life eccentric characters but not without a little sadness too. Joining him is Chloe Moretz forever destined to be remembered for her first major role. She idolized Angelina Jolie apparently. Guess what, you trounced any action movie she has ever made! Moretz dominates any scenes she's in, no easy task considering her fellow cast! Aaron Johnson has the most difficult job of all. Being an original umber-geek after Michael Cera set the standard (anyone who's seen ""Zombieland"" knows it's hard to write an original geek even in a great movie). He shakes it, redefines it and OWNS it. He leads the movie like he wrote it, joined by a cast where even the smallest roles are fully fleshed out. It's quite an ensemble. A renegade band of acting styles forming a perfect one and complementing the film's fun style.<br/><br/>Watching ""Kick Ass"" is ultimately like being on a thrill-ride, it dozen't just want to dazzle you, it's wants to draw you in, ride the wave and leave the cinema on a high. And it dozen't do that with gimmicks or tried and tested formula's, it breaks the mold, shakes conventions and wants you to be surprised while complementing all the movies you already love. It's not just a movie, it's a standard, one that promises to prove movies like this can be written with great heart and brain."
"Jackpollins","10","6","19","19 April 2010"," More than lives up to its title
","The superhero genre was starting to wear a bit thin in my opinion. Right when I thought I'd given up on superheroes, I saw Kick-Ass & all my doubts about the genre quickly faded away. The film starts out with Dave (Aaron Johnson), your stereotypical high school student with two good friends and a pretty normal life. One day, in a comic book store, he tells his friends that he wonders why no one's ever attempted to be a superhero. Dave then transforms into Kick-Ass. When your main character is the least interesting part of the film, it can easily be a good sign or a bad sign. In this case, it's definitely a good sign that Kick-Ass is the least interesting character in the film. Chloe Moretz, coming off her excellent performances in 500 Days Of Summer continues to show how great of an actress she is by stealing the show as Hit-Girl. After being in a row of bad films such as Next, Knowing,The Wicker Man & G-Force, Nicolas Cage returns in top form as Big Daddy, Hit-Girl's dad. Mark Strong is excellent as the bad guy Frank & Christopher Mintz-Plasse is excellent as his son, Chris who dresses up as Red Mist. Overall, Kick-Ass will satisfy even people who are not into the superhero genre, but it certainly helps."

","Like many I presume, after seeing the commercials and being dazzled by the bright colors and the pint-sized superhero I'd later learn was called Hit Girl I thought that this was perhaps a children's movie. But don't be fooled, Kick Ass is anything but for the young kids. This is a teen and grown up movie and should be regarded as such for the language and extreme violence.<br/><br/>I really found Kick Ass to be an enjoyable movie. It held itself together reasonable well and I found little that I would've done differently. Mainly just toning down the most extreme violence and the sexual innuendos neither of which is my thing, and particularly the later I found myself squirming in the theater seat and wondering if I was the only one that felt both uncomfortable and like I was watching a throw back to the 80's when movies had that level of cheap sexual thrills.<br/><br/>It was really entertaining watching our main protagonist, Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson), think he had what it took to become a superhero. Now I guess we know why most all superheroes have powers, some kind of ability or a gimmick. Generally speaking, they'd get their butt kicked if they didn't. While the movie started somewhat slow, and you perhaps couldn't help but roll your eyes at Dave's really cheesy superhero costume it was humorous to see him try and step up.<br/><br/>But it's really Hit Girl (played by Chloe Grace Moretz) that just runs with the movie. Being swept up into the larger story of the running conflict between Hit Girl, Big Daddy (Nicholas Cage) and big bad Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong) you really get the sense that Dave ""Kick Ass"" Lizewski doesn't know what he got himself into and definitely didn't sign up for the events of the movie; but nevertheless does the right thing by the later part of the movie. The characters of Hit Girl and her father, Big Daddy, take themselves and what they do very seriously. And it's once they appear that the movie really takes on a new life and moves past being perhaps just a cheesy flick. It's the later story, involving these two that holds the entire movie together.<br/><br/>With all going on in this movie, the extreme violence, the sexual innuendos, the perhaps question of is this a movie being marketed at kids to young (reference the colors) and whatever else I find it funny that critics take exception with the foul language (and one word in particular) uttered by the Hit Girl character. With everything else going on a single word is what the critics focus on? Perhaps they could've cleaned up her language some but they didn't have anything else to say about the movie? Chloe Grace Moretz will be known for this movie. She will undoubtedly go on to a great career in movies if he continues barring a really bad bomb of a future film. Perhaps I'm not alone in thinking that a Hit Girl centered movie would be a great idea, but would it be a sequel or a prequel? (I'd vote for either) The problem though (and probably why you'd have to go with a sequel) is that Ms. Moretz made this film almost two years ago when she was only eleven, and as seen most recently on the Tonight Show plugging this movie, now at age thirteen she's really grown and changed from her character Mindy ""Hit Girl"" MacReady. I applaud her for being a child star but wanting to skip the age appropriate, pop-corn fluff that is usually written for children and saying to the motion picture industry that kids and do action also.<br/><br/>The only real problem I had with this movie was Katie, Dave's crush and ultimately to become his girlfriend. From crush to girlfriend is fine. But she sends Kick Ass to talk some sense into gang members causing her trouble and they don't explain how an innocent enough looking girl has some kind of relationship with a den of drug dealing gang members? Talk about a hole in your script and a lack of detail.<br/><br/>KB"

","I have been looking forward to kick-ass for a while. I actually heard of it because I am a Nic Cage fan. After reading reviews and watching trailers, I had no idea what to expect. I either thought it was going to be a total comedy or an obscene, vulgar, no-plot movie. It's actually a little of both. Kick-Ass has the perfect mix between a ""superhero"" flick and a comedy. It is pretty controversial, but I would expect nothing less. The story was the biggest surprise to me. This movie had a WONDERFUL story. It made me laugh and almost cry in parts. The directors also added some comedy into the most brutal scenes to keep them from being too harsh. Nic Cage is not himself at all in this movie. Most people will probably enjoy this. Aaron Johnson, to me, was alright (not perfect) but his quirkiness was quite charming. Mark Strong was a very cynical actor. I could keep going down the list, but Chloe Moretz stole the show. She was FANTASTIC. Overall the acting was stupendous. Kick-Ass just did everything right. Even the music made for a fun experience (The Banana Splits and Spaghetti Western music) was very fun during gory battles. This movie is also one that rarely drug. Most movies have that ""middle-section"" that just makes the viewer want to gouge out his or her eyes. Not here. Overall, if you can take some gore and cussing, and are looking for fun; SEE THIS MOVIE. The end. 10/10"
"blacklist-1","9","6","19","16 April 2010"," Does this film Kick-Ass? You bet!
","Kick-Ass is one of the most original films to come out in years, particularly in the superhero genre. Forget Batman, Spiderman and Superman. Kick-Ass is the new hero in cinema. Aaron Johnson played nerdy Dave desperate to be a superhero though he has no ounce of powers and is just a normal fifteen year old as he asks how far would go to protect someone you don't know being hurt? Would you stop to help them or just look the other way? He's also longing for a beautiful girl in school called Kate. He teams up with Hit-Girl, a very cool and superbly acted part played by Chloe Moretz and Big Dadddy, Nicolas Cage (seriously) dressed up like Batman with the exact replica voice of Adam West to take down a drug lord played excellently by Mark Strong who also has a son who dresses up as a hero calling himself Red Mist.<br/><br/>Chloe Moretz steals the show in my opinion as she is the one who truly kicks ass, taught by her dad to shoot, fight and kill with swords (grown up men!) This is a fantastic film that takes you by the balls and takes you on a roller-coaster ride of your life. All expectations of what you think this film will be like is thrown out of the window. With a superb script and acting. (Nicolas Cage being back on form after his less than average performances of recent). Kick-Ass is so outrageously daft in a brilliant way making it deliciously daring and absolutely hilarious and it dosen't pretend to be otherwise as it makes great fun of itself. The action sequences are also crafted with an expert eye. My jaw dropped when I first saw it. It's that amazingly done. But be warned though it is funny it's also extremely crude and violent so if you don't like guts steer clear.<br/><br/>The movie is intelligent in my opinion with such originality and daftness. Kids becoming superheroes with no powers! I absolutely loved it and Matthew Vaughn knows how to keep the pace of the film going, not by endless expanded scenes but keeping the characters moving and transitioning the film from romance to action to comedy and drama ceaselessly which is no easy task. There is the definite possibility of a sequel on it's way. If you haven't seen this yet, what are you waiting for? GO!"

","This movie was so awesome! As a film handler I see a bunch of crap go in and out of the theater I work at week in and week out.<br/><br/>This movie just put all my faith back into the movie industry, there's only one movie about every 4 or 5 years like this. Movies like this raise the bar for movie making higher then you thought it could go.<br/><br/>The story followed the comic pretty well, there were a few things that weren't touched on but come on, what are you going to tell me every movie that is loosely based on anything, not just comics, suck because the director didn't want to add a few things?<br/><br/>The transitions from one scene to another were so crazy smooth that during a few of them i literally said out loud, ""Wow that was f-ing awesome!"". The most notable one was the scene that went from the teddy cam on the TV to the next scene showing Big Daddy mess up all those mobsters!<br/><br/>The action was always done in such a way that reflected the hero that was fighting, I thought that was a very important but subtly done. As with Hit Girl every time she fought she killed people with such psychopathic glee that it just made you feel a little crazy for enjoying it, but you couldn't help but laugh and then open your mouth. Kick Ass and Big Daddy also had their own add style to fighting, Kick Ass got well he got his ass kicked a lot. And Big Daddy did a LOT of ass kicking.<br/><br/>Which leads to my next thing. Nicholas Cage had a very interesting character, if you saw him on the street with his little daughter you would never expect to see him stabbing people and tossing frags. But when he was Big Daddy he was the biggest bad ass in the world. <br/><br/>Aaron Johnson also played a very good role. I was actually surprised hearing him in the movie, I had seen a few interviews with him prior to the movies release and he has a very British accent! But more important then his accent was his portrayal of Dave Lizewshi turn from a nobody in high school to Kick Ass, the superhero, and then even later in the movie the realization that they were no longer two people but rather he had taken the best traits from both Dave and Kick Ass and became a person he was happy with.<br/><br/>And it wasn't just the acting that was awesome, the writing was superb! All the writing in the movie didn't hold anything back, it's about time that mainstream Hollywood caught up with some of these indie writers and realized that no body going into an R-rated movie really cares if there are more than two f-bombs in the entire movie. Of course I'm no fourth grader, sometimes little Chloe Moretz seems a little too comfortable with her inner potty mouth, but hey if she has no problem killing more people in five minutes then over half of the worlds citizens do in their entire life then dropping the c-word out.<br/><br/>I found all the little things in this movie amazing, some more irrelevant then others, The Spirit 3?!<br/><br/>So in short there is way too much good for me to think of much bad about the movie. I suppose I would have made a better soundtrack for the movie but hey I guess that's just the inner music buff in me coming out.<br/><br/>Also even though I was the target audience, I can see the above 35 crowd being really turned off by a lot of things in the movie. Then again it doesn't seem like the movie really needs or wants your approval. <br/><br/>This movie gives a big middle finger to everyone, including Hollywood and all their pussy comic book movies, and they didn't even need superpowers to do it! <br/><br/>I can't stress this next statement enough: GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!"
"mattyj2001","9","6","19","15 April 2010"," Surprised At How Much I Liked It - mild plot spoilers
","I attended an early screening of Kick-Ass last week, the new action/comedy flick based on a comic book written by Mark Millar and illustrated by John Romita, Jr. Millar was also responsible for writing the comic book behind the 2008 Angelina Jolie vehicle Wanted. I had to look all that up on Wikipedia because I'm not a comic book nerd, I'm a movie nerd, and this review will be coming from that perspective.<br/><br/>Kick-Ass tells the story of Dave Lizewski and his alter ego, Kick-Ass, who was borne of a conversation he has with his two best friends at the comic book store. With the millions of people that have loved comic books throughout their history, why has not one of them attempted to become a real-life superhero? We soon find out as Lizewski dons a green body suit and mask then sets out to the streets of New York City (which sometimes looks suspiciously like Toronto) to fight crime and otherwise serve those in need. Kick-Ass's fame grows as he shows up on the evening news, YouTube and starts soliciting jobs from people through MySpace (MySpace still exists? Is their entire business model now just product placement in movies?) As he gets more famous he crosses paths with another pair of self-made superheroes who shun the limelight in service to the task at hand: revenge.<br/><br/>Nic Cage plays Big Daddy, the alter ego of Damon Macready. Chloe Moretz plays Mindy Macready/Hit-Girl, his daughter, in a surprising performance littered with wit, charm, poignancy and a physical presence one would not expect of an 11 year old (she was 11 when this was filmed, 13 now. Don't complain to me.) She is clearly the star of this movie. A precocious child that swears a lot and Nic Cage, either one of those things alone would normally have me avoiding that movie like I avoid vegetables. But somehow, together, they manage to pull out a great, singular performance that really draws you in emotionally. I'm not embarrassed to admit that I almost choked up a little at one particular line Hit Girl says to Big Daddy late in the movie. Or maybe I just had some dust in my eye.<br/><br/>The intersecting and eventual merging paths of these very differently motivated superheroes was well written and fleshed out and kept the pacing of the movie going at a steady clip. Add in Christopher Mintz-Plasse as Chris D'Amico/Red Mist and you have yourself a movie. The masterful balance between comedy and action made it easy to overlook the clichéd mafia stereotypes and side-plot regarding Lizewski and his sexuality, perhaps the only two things I can nitpick about Kick-Ass.<br/><br/>The movie asks some interesting questions about the nature, motivations for and costs of fame. It doesn't necessarily answer any of those questions but exploring them from opposite ends of the spectrum at the same time made for a thoroughly entertaining movie.<br/><br/>What with all the hype around Kick-Ass I was expecting it to be somewhat mediocre but I was pleasantly surprised. I had lowish expectations and was not expecting to be so engaged from start to finish. We were not allowed to bring guests to the movie and I will be more than happy to pay to sit through this one again with my wife when it is released to theaters. This movie deserves to be a hit.<br/><br/>Some additional notes: Aaron Johnson is British? Really? Dang, great American accent. The acting all around was good. Nic Cage's real-life bat-s**t crazy persona translates well to a make-believe bat-s**t crazy persona.<br/><br/>The comedy to action balance was weighted toward action way more than I expected. The movie was funny, but it is essentially not a comedy. More of a comic book action thriller.<br/><br/>There is a lot of cartoon violence in the movie, it might not be for everyone. 90% of it comes at the hands of Hit Girl and people of weak constitution might take offense to that.<br/><br/>The action sequences were very well done. Although there were a lot of quick cuts I thought they were very well edited. I hate to sound lame and describe it as 'kenetic', but there was a certain energy to them that translated well from screen to eye. I most appreciated the smooth camera motion and lack of shake (I'm looking at you, Jason Bourne) which provided good flow to the action. The start of the final battle sequence in the movie used a particularly clever device that I've never seen used before, and will probably never be used again lest a director get accused of making a cheap Kick-Ass knockoff. I'll refrain from ruining the surprise here.<br/><br/>Kudos to the people that put together the trailers and commercials, they ruin nothing. There were a couple genuine surprises in the movie that could have easily been revealed by even the smallest clips."
"Zac-attack","9","6","19","13 April 2010"," Definitely one of the best superhero films I've ever seen...
","This is possibly one of my all time favourite films. And definitely one of the best superhero films I've seen.<br/><br/>Not only is the casting great, the costumes and set design fantastic, the filming flawless, but the writing is perfect. The movie manages to keep you on the edge of your proverbial seat right till the end credits, not only with the brilliant action sequences which show very realistic looking stunts and manages to stay roughly within the real of the not- so-ridiculously-impossible but also with the sense of mystery and intrigue about characters, plans and romance. <br/><br/>Unlike most comedy films where the they mock an overused genre, ""Kick- Ass"" actually portrays very realistic character motivation and progression. Almost every aspect of the film that you expect to be unexplained and left down to narrative license, is fully accounted for.<br/><br/>Whilst accomplishing all this, the script manages to be genuinely funny and at times surprises you with a line or scene even funnier than you anticipated. It manages to be funny, an honest superhero film and steer clear of mocking the genre in any way.<br/><br/>By the time ""Kick-Ass"" is over, you're left with a content feeling that all the loose ends have been tied up, every inconvenient detail they could have left out they cover before the film is over in a satisfactory manner and you even come out of it wondering if you should purchase some nunchuks..."

","Wasn't sure what to expect going into this one as I'm not a huge fan of superhero films and the adverts didn't give much away, but I was amazed at how good it was. Great soundtrack, really good acting and original storyline - somehow managed to be funny, dramatic and action-packed all in one without compromising any of them. <br/><br/>Hit-girl definitely stole the show for me - something very amusing about a sweet and innocent looking little girl decapitating people and using profanity. Nicholas Cage was also very good in my opinion, as was Red Mist.<br/><br/>Well worth a watch on the big screen for almost any film fan - just be warned that it's not as child-friendly as the trailers may appear. There are at least a couple of pretty gritty scenes which I would be uncomfortable really with any child seeing."

","""Kick ass"" is an absolute pathetic excuse for a movie. Just the other day, we were talking in school about how cinema is not cinema anymore, since it is constantly evolving and the boundaries of motion-pictures (and the subsequent visual representations) are broken.<br/><br/>Well, making an analogy with Evolutionism, this shouldn't even appear on the evolution scale. A total waste of money and resources. And you've got Nicholas Cage in it, to cap it off. It's all clichés and using classical music for such gross and distasteful scenes is a regretful.

"rofl_olivia","1","5","15","9 September 2010"," Not so awesome
","After hearing so much hype surrounding this movie, I was pretty excited to see it for myself – safe to say I was greatly disappointed. The first half hour or so was pretty decent. There were some funny one-liners and moderately amusing scenes in which the characters and plot were taking shape, however it all went downhill from there. The main problem with this film is that the overall tone is constantly changing. Firstly it is portrayed as a comedy, then an action, then a drama, then a teen movie, then a comedy...etc, it's difficult to keep up and some scenes which are intended to be of a comedic nature most definitely are not. I've read enough reviews about this film and it appears to shift between the opinions of: ""omg best movie ever made!"" and ""irresponsible!"" Now I'm no prude. I'm 18 years old and like movies that push the boundaries and intend to shock but I am solidly sticking to the irresponsible take on this film. Don't get me wrong, I really wanted to enjoy it. I wanted to turn off my mind and enjoy the hour and a half of senseless violence, glorifying torture and the lack of innocence amongst children... but I couldn't. There were kids in my cinema, about the same age as ""Hit Girl"" who were laughing in the scenes that contained extreme violence and coarse language, mainly because this movie (much to do with the title – Kick Ass) is portrayed as a comedy but people, either young or just stupid, can't differentiate between the two. A little girl saying the 'c' word isn't funny. An innocent person getting his head stomped into the ground isn't funny. A geeky, teenage kid getting stabbed and kicked whilst he's down isn't funny. A torture scene, regardless if it involves two funny-looking superheroes, isn't funny. A child getting beaten up by a fully grown man isn't funny. You get my drift. Overall, I was extremely let down and downright disgusted by this movie. Sure, there were some pretty cool action scenes and special effects but it doesn't make up for the complete and utter failure of turning violence into comedy. Though this begs the question: is this what MY generation finds funny? An interesting scene which I witness all too often being the irresponsible teen I am is where Kick Ass tries to defend a man being beaten up, in front of a busy teenage-filled shop. Instead of running to the man's aid, the teenagers instead egg the fight on, watching on in excitement as these guys get the Sh** kicked out of them. They get out their mobiles out to record it all, most likely sending it to their friends or uploading to YouTube, because seeing people get seriously injured is so damn funny. I guess in my opinion this is the only thing this movie did well. It really did display how sadistic and messed up teenagers and children are becoming. The complete and utter lack of innocence in this film is horrendous. I was personally embarrassed for my generation watching this film and all these reviews dubbing it ""sooo awesome!!"" irritate me beyond belief. Just comes to show how idiotic some people are. But hey, each to their own."

It was my fault to have expectations for this movie to be at least even close to be half as funny as Superbad. It didn't even make me grin. There are lots of noobs that like this movie and have given it a radically cool rating of over 8. But then again don't watch it because it has a good rating in IMDb.

"CageRage","8","5","15","28 April 2010"," Well, Is It?: A Review of Kick-Ass
","Once upon a time, in 2008, we were young, and foolish. With the release of Iron Man, we felt that the perfect not-too serious, non-stop entertainment superhero film had been achieved. We were wrong. Now, it is 2010, and the bar has been set yet again. And more than that, the bar hasn't just been set higher, the bar has been raced out of the old building into a new one with 5000 more floors and placed at the very top. Such is the new film by director Matthew Vaughn starring new comer Aaron Johnson, Kick-Ass.<br/><br/>The film tells the story of Dave Lizewski, a nerdy teenager with an astoundingly unexciting life. One day, out of sheer boredom, he decides to become a superhero. He dons a painted wetsuit and mask and becomes Kick-Ass. However, things don't go very well for him the first time out, and he contemplates quitting. But he figure he ought to keep on keeping on and tries it again, this time with some semblance of success. Through his adventures, he comes into contact with professional vigilantes Big Daddy (Nicholas Cage, in a truly amazing career turnaround) and Hit-Girl (Chloë Grace Moretz, proving there are still great child actors out there). They're out to stop drug kingpin Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong) and Kick-Ass—in a way only an untrained buffoon like him could—gets involved. As for all the rest of the plot and various sub-plots: you'll have to see the movie to find out.<br/><br/>First off, let's get out some things that could be considered problems. One: the violence. Don't let the kid-friendly trailers fool you, this movie is brutal. Blood splatters, bodies explode, and limbs get hacked off. The more touch types aren't going to be fans, and it might throw off people who just saw the trailers. Two: the juxtaposition of said violence with raunchy, zany comedy. This is another thing that might throw people off. Seeing a guy pretending to be gay to hang out with a girl he likes isn't something you expect to see in the same movie wherein drug dealers explode a dude in an industrial-sized microwave. It's another thing that a lot of people won't be expecting, and it could cause confusion. Make no mistake, even tough the violence is graphic, it's still over-the-top, and should not be taken seriously.<br/><br/>That's pretty much it for potential problems. So, do either of those things actually detract from the film's watch ability? No. Not even a little. The movie just works, plain and simple, it works. And it works beautifully. It manages to be a great satire of superhero movies while at the same time being a great superhero movie itself. Every single frame oozes visual style and reminds the viewer why they go to the movies: to be entertained. To be entertained and to be entertained in a way that doesn't involve you making fun of bad characters' actions or turning your brain off. Pure cinematic escapism, dare to say, on a par with the original 1933 King Kong. It's serious when it needs to be, funny when it needs to be, and incredibly exciting when it needs to be. This brings us to another great thing about this film, the action sequences. Some of the most mind-blowing, pulse-pounding action you will ever see, you will see in Kick-Ass. It's a brutal ballet. Think if Dancing with the Stars involved chopping opponents into ribbons. Let's see Robert Downey Jr. do that with the Iron Man armor.<br/><br/>Finally, we talk about the absolute best part of this film (although saying anything is ""best"" in this film is like saying there's a ""best"" part of eating the world's greatest ice cream), the characters, and by extension, the actors. There is no such thing as a weak character in Kick-Ass. Everybody here is fleshed out and fantastic to watch. Even Dave Lizewski's girlfriend, whom one would think to be boring, and yet she's not, you actually get attached to her despite her limited screen time. The same goes to Dave's friends, who provide some of the best laughs in the film. That's thanks to both a great script and great acting. Everybody here brings their A-Game. Johnson does a great job portraying the title character, and Christopher-Mintz-Plasse (Superbad's McLovin') is quite entertaining as Red Mist. But the two characters that everybody will love come in the form of Hit-Girl and Big Daddy. Already, I established that Chloë Moretz and Nicholas Cage do a great job in their respective roles, but on top of that, both characters are the perfect blend of loving father and daughter and awesome crime-fighters. There's something inherently hilarious about Nic Cage impersonating Adam West as Batman, and who doesn't want to see an 11-year-old girl spouting profanities and committing acts that would make John McClain green with envy? And of course, this film goes the extra mile to give us glimpses into these character's back stories and gives the audience something more to latch onto than a few laughs.<br/><br/>So, in short, Kick-Ass knows exactly what it's doing: creating a well-told tale that makes you wish all superhero movies were like it. It's exciting, emotional, hilarious, and overall incredible. A perfect five Godzillas. You must see this movie.<br/><br/>Oh, and in case you were wondering: it does, indeed, kick ass."

The big 3D movies have been great but kick ass that that raw appeal to it that with the brilliant action scenes that really make you ooh and aah. combining them with some cracking laughs and some great acting, Nick Cage brought it for the first time in a long time, and i felt all the superhero characters really filled the rolls exactly how i wanted to. Hitgirl in particular really hit the spot especially after the line ""which one of you c**ts am i going to kill first?"" i thought maaaaaaate this is going to be a bumpy ride! i was right, it was... all the way. so go see it on the big screen as it is one of those movies for sure."

","I went into the cinema with a very pessimistic attitude towards this film. Having been a fan of the comic for a good hour (I read the comic just before I went to watch it), I had a lot of doubts about the cast choices and the plot variations that the film makers would have had to make. nguage or you lack a sense of humour Boy was I wrong. Kick-Ass is one hundred per-cent cinematic gold, and I class myself as having very good taste in film. You will only be disappointed by this film if you do not like violence, bad language or you lack a sense of humour. I will not give away too much of the film but all of the actors are great, and I mean all of them. The script is fresh, funny and engaging. The action is impeccable. The music choices for the film were inspired and worked incredibly well. I honestly cannot find any flaws with this film at all.<br/><br/>Go and see it, it will blow you away."
"Meven_Stoffat","10","5","15","17 April 2010"," Too dark, too violent, too brutal... yet totally hilarious!
","I gotta say that going to see Kick-Ass last night was one of the most surprising movie-going experiences in a long time. The trailer made it look like your typical action comedy. That said the trailers still piqued my interest. When I went to go see it, I was totally unprepared for the dark, disturbing and violent, yet extremely hilarious ride that is Kick-Ass. So as you may see, the trailers were totally misleading... in a good way. It is a bit of a shame that this was a rather underwhelming box office result; but maybe it'll boost next weekend due to all the good word of mouth.<br/><br/>Kick-Ass is NOT your typical action comedy. It is NOT this year's Pineapple Express or Inglourious Basterds. Kick-Ass is a dark, twisted, violent and and brutal fun ride through a wannabe superhero, his love interest, a superhero who's dad is part of the Mob, a superhero daddy and his daughter, and a twisted plot involving the mob. It is also totally hilarious and has the usual teen movie formula with the love interest and the protagonist's geeky friends. Those mixed together form quite possibly the best movie I've seen this year! Dave is a geeky, young, teen boy. He has two geeky best friends he hangs with and is totally invisible to the girls. He always has wondered what it is like to be a superhero. But moreso, the question becomes: what is a superhero without superpowers? Batman doesn't have superpowers. One day, he finds a superhero costume online and orders it, and with it soon becomes the first actual superhero: Kick-Ass. One day after getting stabbed by a hoodlum, he gets tons of metal plates installed and now he has the chops to be a superhero! Meanwhile, Mindy (performed wonderfully by Chloe Meritz) and her daddy Damon (played by Nicolas Cage) live together and live in danger. He teaches Mindy to grow up early if the time comes where he dies and she has nobody to go to. However, they become superheroes themselves when hearing of Kick-Ass's fighting with gang members in a parking lot. As for the kid who's dad is in the mob, Chris? He becomes one too, Red Mist. But when the mob believe that Kick-Ass is killing all their members off, a war wages between the bunch and the mob, strapping the audience to their seats for one brutal and hilarious ride! As mentioned, Kick-Ass is just that: KICK-ASS!!!!! A stellar cast is combined with a great script and tons of brutal violence. Aaron Johnson does a great job as Dav, and does a great job at hiding his British accent. Nic Cage, someone I usually do not like is hilarious as well, his Adam West mannerisms are pure epic win in every sense. But the show stealer: Chloe Meritz!!!! She turns in a performance as tough-as-nails 12 year old Hit Girl. As for the violence, it's definitely not for the squeamish. There's a load of gore, and when the gory bits come you'll be shocked for sure. The torture scene is probably one of the most disturbing scenes I've seen in a long time too. Also you may find it shocking that a 12 year old is doing most of the killing! This movie is definitely not for kids under 15. It is indeed very violent and disturbing and they will probably find it disturbing too. But aside from that, this is an excellent movie that is a must-see this year! You'll NOT regret it."
"TheLittleSongbird","10","4","11","13 July 2011"," Totally kicks ass!
","I can't think of a better summary for this film, but this is not only one of the more enjoyable superhero films recently, but also of the overall year of 2010. I had heard it was good, but I wasn't sure whether it would be my thing. I needn't have worried.<br/><br/>Kick-Ass was hugely enjoyable from start to finish. The production values from the photography and editing to the glorious costumes are striking, and the soundtrack has a lot of energy. As does the fast pace, the smart and witty dialogue and a fun and unpredictable story. The characters are also at least engaging, the action is fantastically choreographed and edited and the acting even from Nicholas Cage(who I have found resume-wise inconsistent) is much better than one would hope.<br/><br/>Overall, truly wonderful and totally kicks ass. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
"pulp_post","6","4","11","2 May 2010"," Not bad, all in all
","This review is just intended for the users who already saw the movie, so please don't read it if you have not seen it already because it does contain spoilers.<br/><br/>I liked Kick Ass with some reserve. The biographic start would have been average or even good if they have not tried so hard to sound funny. Someone dying abruptly in a movie can be funny in certain contexts (like in Monty Python's Holy Grail when King Arthur and the knights are saved because the cartoonist died all of a sudden and thus could not develop the scene where the monster was about to kill them all), but certainly not in the situation portrayed in the beginning of Kick Ass. Well, that this movie wasn't written by any John Cleese became clear soon enough, given the amount of failed, bad-taste juvenile and brainless jokes throughout the movie.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I was not impressed by the violence that followed the biographical introduction, for I've seen much worse in horror/ gore movies, so while the violence was not a point against the film per se, it served to show once more (a bit like Park Chan-wook's Thirst, perhaps, but in a milder way here) that action is not enough to keep the pace in a movie, if such action adds little to the plot. So, there's not much happening in the first half of the movie and I kept wondering why they have made the film at all. At the same time, some qualities also start to show since the very beginning - good photography and camera work, and I as value such attributes a lot, even the first half wasn't so boring after all.<br/><br/>The film sort of explodes into the second half though, when the direction seems more defined and follows an intelligent path. Unlike most viewers, I'm not going to give to Chloe Moretz all the credit for bringing life to the film - while I think that her scenes were probably the best, it would not have happened just because of her acting (or choreography in the fighting scenes), but also for an incredible direction, music and camera work - in other words, her scenes were the best cared for. If the jokes kept being sort of dry in the second half, the references to other movies could make up for them (like the allusion to Tarantino's movies, subtly hinted by the music played in the scene at the hotel's hall). The cartoon part was pure genius, achieved in a superb way.<br/><br/>I gave 6/10 because in overall terms it cannot still be compared to the incredible, eternal movies that have sadly just scored 7 or even less in IMDb, so this 6 is a sort of absolute mark. In relative terms, and thinking mainly in the movies we are seeing in the first half of 2010 (saved by Dr Parnassus so far), I'd give 7 or even 8 stars to it, because it's well above the average nowadays."
"preppy-3","7","4","11","1 May 2010"," Definitely has its moments but mostly an uneasy mixture of violence and comedy
","An ordinary, comic book obsessed high school kid named Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) with no super powers decides to become a super hero named Kick-Ass...with a pretty silly costume. He's almost killed in his first encounter but doesn't let it stop him. He runs into two other super heroes--Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) and his 11 year old daughter Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz). They're trying to get rid of big crime head Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong).<br/><br/>OK--I never read the graphic novel this was based on so I can't make any comparisons. But, even though I was never bored and laughed out loud more than once, I found this incredibly uneven and troubling. There's plenty of pretty funny jokes (my favorites is when Hit Girl is killing a large number of gangsters and you hear Joan Jett's ""Bad Reputation"" playing!) and Cage does a hilarious imitation of Adam West's line readings from the old ""Batman"" TV series. Also the acting is good (especially from Johnson who must have been embarrassed wearing that silly costume). The violence is extreme--LOTS of blood and broken bones and body parts--BUT it's shown in quick cuts and it's more comic book than anything else. SPOILERS!!!! However, when Big Daddy and Kick-Ass are captured near the end the film gets WAY too violent and upsetting. Seeing the two of them getting beaten nonstop while hand-cuffed to chairs is just going too far. Also Hit Girl is brutally beaten up by Frank D'Amico (a few members of my audience gasped in shock). It DOES have a happy ending but you go through hell to get there. The premise is good but this film seems more determined to shock the audience than anything else. Also the extreme violence and comedy never mesh together--it's a VERY uneasy mix. I applaud the film for doing something different but the results are mediocre. I give this a 7."
"d_art","7","4","11","17 April 2010"," 'Kick-Ass' is entertaining to watch but with mixed aftertaste
","In this film, Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) is a high-schooler who isn't particularly popular or athletic, but loves comics. One day, he decides to don a superhero costume, name himself ""Kick Ass,"" and fight crime at night. After few mishaps, he succeeds, and becomes an instant celebrity. Then, he meets Big Daddy and the 11-year-old Hit Girl, couple of more capable (and secretive) masked vigilantes, who are trying to take down the crime boss Frank D'Amico. He winds up joining forces with them. Meanwhile, D'Amico hatches a plan to kill him.<br/><br/>The film is directed stylishly by Matthew Vaughn (Layer Cake), based on a comic book by Mark Millar and John Romita Jr. The film starts off like a teen comedy with Dave and his friends talking about girls, comics, and how there aren't any heroes around. I really liked the premise of the film—the whole ""what if"" scenario of a normal person fighting crime in a real world (that is, without all the money that Bruce Wayne in Batman had), which is probably why I loved the first 30 minutes of it. Once the mafia and other heroes come in, it goes more into that superhero action movie mode with explosions and other stuff people pay for.<br/><br/>Aaron Johnson plays his role as the geeky Dave with great conviction and sympathy. His character is heroic not because he is capable, but he has a heart of a hero. Chloe Moretz plays the 11-year old Hit Girl with a lot of attitude. There's certainly some shock value of a little kid cussing and vanquishing bad guys, but more on that later. Nicholas Cage brings a lot of dark humor playing the oddball father role as Big Daddy.<br/><br/>The plot pretty much takes the initial premise and just runs with it, breaking many rules along the way. There's teen angst humor aplenty, the geek dialogue is a lot of fun, and there's occasional dark violence, which can be a mixed bag. There's a certain optimistic innocence to the character of Dave, which is nice in context of the story, but the limits of realism of the film's world can be rather unclear. Perhaps it's more for sake of realism (or is it?), but the heroes are allowed to kill people (well, at least the bad guys). I can imagine Sylvester Stallone from Judge Dredd screaming, ""I'm not under the law—I am the law!"" Traditionally, though, even up to the more realistic The Dark Knight, killing is the one rule that heroes often don't break—and they take it more seriously. Given the fact that this is a comic book movie, or at least a celebration of that genre, it's surprising that it's not at least addressed. But, it helps the action, so it's mostly glossed over.<br/><br/>The action is fun to look at, quite well-edited, but rather unsettling, when one thinks about it. I take it the novelty here is seeing an 11-year old girl cussing and ruthlessly gunning down adults (yes, they're still bad guys) in stylistic, over-the-top fashion. I suppose it works within the context of a comic book movie, yet we see gore and blood and gunshots rather realistically. Quite a desensitized kid we have here. Now, imagine if we had a black kid playing this part. There would be a huge uproar and this film would be amongst the most controversial movies ever made (never mind that these are still bad guys getting killed). Of course, we don't really believe that a little girl could ever do that stuff in real life, which is why many are not as bothered by it. It's dismissed as usual comic book silliness (at least until we see a similar event happening in the news). Call me sensitive, but it left a bit of a bitter taste in my mouth.<br/><br/>This film, overall, was entertaining, unique, and certainly had no shortage of style. Some compared this movie to The Dark Knight—I guess they must've not liked The Dark Knight as much as I did. The Dark Knight had a lot more layer and Christopher Nolan's works are always more complex beyond the surface. I also prefer Watchmen and Spider-Man over this. This film is well-acted, the dialogue is interesting, and I liked the characters enough to wish they make it to the end. Beyond the surface, though, the film isn't quite as fun as I'd like it to be. On occasion, Dave sometimes did feel like second fiddle compared to Hit Girl and Big Daddy, who are the ones pushing the plot forward. And, of course, that mixed aftertaste I had.<br/><br/>I recall a nice moment in the film where an onlooker at a window watches a mugging-in-progress, then merely looks away, not even calling the police—Dave then points out that average people have become desensitized about things like justice. I really appreciated that scene. I wondered what would've happened if the film expanded on that idea about society? Perhaps he'll discover we don't really need a costumed hero in allowing justice to be done. We can all be heroes by doing the bare minimum of looking out for each other. After all, desire for justice is one of the reasons we are inspired by superheroes. It certainly could've been a more interesting, multilayered movie. Overall, though, ** 1/2 out of **** stars.<br/><br/>For more my article updates, you can also follow me on http://twitter.com/d_art"

","Kick Ass is a completely unique superhero film that we haven't seen before and it is completely awesome. This film sees average College student Dave decide he wants to try to be a superhero and protect people until he encounters real superheroes Big Daddy and Hit Girl who are attempting to take down mob boss Frank D'Amico. Now I am not a huge fan of Aaron Taylor Johnson but this is the one exception as I truly believe he is a great Kick Ass and provides a good realistic humour that makes his character really funny. The supporting cast also all do fantastic jobs with Nicholas Cage doing a brilliant job in particular, his character of Big Daddy is great and he is the coolest character in the film and really helps play alongside Kick Ass. His daughter Hit Girl is played by Chloe Grace Moretz and this was really her break out roll with her being an awesome character and her dialogue is awesome especially for the age of the character. When casting a great villain the best is probably Mark Strong and he proves it in this film with an awesome performance as a fantastic villain. His Son Chris D'Amico is played by Christopher Mintz-Plasse and he does a good job especially contrasting with Mark Strong. The story is the weak point of this film with it being pretty straight forward but it is executed decently I just think there could have been more done to make it more unique. The script is utterly superb with the dialogue and chemistry from each character being utterly hilarious and great. The style of the film is really unique and really provide a different fantastic look on superhero genre, yes it is stylised but it is still great. This is a fantastic film that really makes this film so rewatchable and one of my favourite superhero films."

","I have seen a lot of comic book movies over the years. Some have been pretty good, and some have been pretty bad (Watchmen) I really wasn't that interested in seeing Matthew Vaughn's new comic book flick Kick-Ass in the beginning because it looked like another parody comic book film just like Mystery Men from the cheesy 1990s.<br/><br/>However, my friends all told me what a decent surprise it was, and so I checked it out for myself and man was a surprise it was.<br/><br/>Kick-Ass involved a young teenager living in NYC who wonders why no one has ever tried to be a superhero and after buying a wet suit over the internet he decides to become one. Little does he know that being a superhero in real life is much different than one in a comic book.<br/><br/>The biggest surprise is that Kick-Ass isn't even the main butt kicker in the film, that honor goes to a tween titan named Hit Girl, probably the deadliest child action hero ever put on the big screen. Her father, Big Daddy, is played by Nicholas Cage in easily his best role in years. The ending is so over the top it has to be seen to be believed.<br/><br/>I can't give enough praise to Kick-Ass. It takes the super hero genre and turns it on it's knees, it's easily one of the year's biggest surprises and I can definitely say that it's a much better film than last year's Watchmen was! Kick-Ass definitely lives up to it's name"

","""Kick-Ass"" sets out to lay waste to the archetypal superhero movie, but some see the film as just another addition to the superhero genre. Those who argue for satire point to the first half of the film, where Aaron Johnson's ""everyman"" character learns the hard way that becoming a superhero isn't as easy as it looks in movies like ""Spider-Man"" or ""Batman Begins."" You see, Kick-Ass earns a reputation as a superhero, but he lacks the skills of the more covert Hit-Girl and Big Daddy, who lurk in the shadows with high-grade weaponry and martial arts mastery. While Hit-Girl and Big Daddy fight crime, Kick Ass must deal with the everyday plagues of the American teen. In a funny bit, Kick Ass' alter ego, Dave Lizewski, learns that the ""love of his life"" wants him to be...well I won't spoil it, but I will say that it stands in the way of Dave's dreams for a little while. <br/><br/>Bits like that one enrich the first half of Kick Ass with a dose of funny reality. Kick Ass comes off as kind of a loser, Hit-Girl looks way too young to be saying the things she says (and doing the things she does), and Nicolas Cage's Big Daddy stands as one of his funniest creations. He's like an overbearing Little League parent on steroids. Less funny are the villains. Mark Strong, an excellent actor, must play a fairly bland crime kingpin. He does his best to enliven his character's dialogue, but he still comes across as a cross between ""Daredevil's"" Kingpin and ""Iron Man's"" Obadiah Stane. This composite villain has an equally bland son, played by Christopher Mintz-Plasse as a dull redux of McLovin. Still, in the first half of the film, these characters only slightly distract from the bold comedy surrounding the protagonists. Unfortunately, as Jackson Browne once sang, ""all god things must come to an end.""<br/><br/>The good things in ""Kick-Ass"" come to an end when the story begins to embrace the formula it's supposed to be tearing apart. Director Matthew Vaughn abandons humor almost entirely as the film claws its way to a gun-crazy climax. There's nothing funny about a scene in which gangsters kidnap and plan to televise the execution of good, if misguided, characters. Vaughn seems eager to comment on his audience's potentially disturbing fascination with violence. This is clear in the film's first half when Kick-Ass enters a fight with high hopes, only to suffer real consequences. It's similarly clear early in the film, when Hit-Girl dispatches some baddies in gruesome and methodical fashion. Towards the end of the film, however, Vaughn seems to fall into the very trap on which he sought to comment. <br/><br/>The encounters toward the end of the film drip with violence, but it's all very stylized. In order to grip the audience, Vaughn employs a type of violence that allows viewers o revel and cheer. This type of violence dominates most genre superhero films (just look t ""Iron Man's"" robotic smack-down, or at ""The Incredible Hulk's"" creature clash), so I would never expect it from a supposed ""satire"" of those films. Generic plot convention after generic plot convention, standard fight scene after standard fight scene, and ridiculous dialogue piece after ridiculous dialogue piece made the second half of Kick-Ass a huge disappointment That said, most of the action is well-shot, the pace still moved along well, and the film's ending has a certain charm to it. <br/><br/>""Kick-Ass"" was not the film that it could have been. It starts off satirizing genre superhero movies, but it ends up becoming one. Still, the film works well on the whole. It has an exciting visual style, a number of cackle-worthy comedic bits, and some great hammy performances. It doesn't totally kick ass, but it just might kick butt."

","Who has never dreamed of being a superhero? This premise, which is the dream of every child further enhanced after the beginning of the 2000s with the invasion of films of this kind in theaters worldwide, is the base story for this new film by English director Matthew Vaughn, raised to fame after direct the great fantasy Stardust, The Mystery of the Star (2007). Kick-Ass is based on the comic book of the same name written by Mark Millar and illustrated by John Romita, Jr., published by the Marvel Comics editorial line, Icon.<br/><br/>The film tells the life of a normal teenager named Dave Lizeewski (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), who decides to become a superhero under the influence of comic books. He becomes known in the media as ""Kick-Ass"", and motivates the emergence of a new wave of superheroes in the country, including Red Mist (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), who becomes his ""partner"" in combat to crime, the mysterious Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) and his daughter Hit-Girl (Chloë Grace Moretz), who live an electrifying day-to-day killing mobsters. However, when Frank D'Amico sets a trap for heroes, Kick-Ass must prove that it doesn't take powers to be a real superhero.<br/><br/>The big difference in the script by Jane Goldman and Matthew Vaughn knows very well the fact that Dave Lizeewski was the last person we would expect to see as a superhero, not that there was anything wrong with him, but there was also no nothing special. He had few friends, is a fan of comics and is in a phase where hormones are simmering, like any teenager and who had a special passion for his schoolmate Katie Deauxma (Lyndsy Fonseca). In five minutes, we already know our protagonist, what he likes to do, what his life is like and what he plans to do.<br/><br/>'Kick-Ass' is urgent as a satire tribute to the universe of comics and superheroes, but bringing with it all the pop aura and stylized violence. Vaughn was and has been criticized for the violence of the film, but it is worked in a very sophisticated way by the director. When it involves the villains, the media show is a caricatural violence: giant microwave, Japanese sword, bazooka. When it involves Dave Lizewski and his awareness journey, it is important that there is a change of key with the violence becoming more credible, level knife in the belly. The film works as an escapism from the usual serious tone of the comic books, introducing the viewer into a reality marked by nerdy culture through the desires of a teenager who seeks his inspiration in the fictional pages of the comic books.<br/><br/>The script knows how to place emphasis initially on the question that the desire to become a superhero wearing an outfit bought over the internet is not everything. One cannot want to fight criminals and gangs with good intentions alone, without any training. In the first incursions of our new hero in the fight against crime we can already see how dangerous this could be. And the script shows this counterpoint well, the contrast between the lack of preparation of the new aspiring hero with the deep knowledge of martial arts and armaments of the father and daughter duo Big Daddy and Hit-Girl who have been preparing for a long time. take revenge on crime boss Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong) who devised a plan to accuse them of drug trafficking and put him behind bars.<br/><br/>The production is based on the non-modest use of violence and black humor that we can attest to the main inspiration of Kick-Ass. In the action sequences, full of blood and dismemberment, always accompanied by an animated and unusual track, the inspiration for Kill Bill is obvious, even giving himself the right to include a flashback in animation, as seen in Tarantino's work. The production makes use of acid - and real - dialogues to tell a totally crazy, violent and fun story.<br/><br/>Aaron Taylor-Johnson is excellent as the protagonist on his journey to discover what a hero actually represents and the responsibilities arising from this point, but it is the supporting characters who gain all the prominence leaving the work with an even more irreverent air, using and abusing the politically incorrect. Nicolas Cage's Big Daddy is ironic and insane, seeking revenge for facts that occurred in his past, but which also has a great paternal sense. His uniform is a clear and amusing reference to that used by Batman in the 1960s TV series. The Hit-Girl of the excellent Chloë Grace Moretz has already entered the imagination of the cinephile as one of the most striking characters based on comics. The young actress blends her beauty and angelic haircut for an 11-year-old girl until being a real killing machine that was trained from an early age to lacerate everyone who appears in her way. The charming figure when not dressed in the heroine's uniform, but who at the same time asks for a gun as a Christmas present, disappears completely when she wields all kinds of weapons and batons beating and killing a bunch of merciless mobsters. This is undoubtedly the supersummof what we call black humor. They are arms, heads and legs cut off and a huge smile on the girl's face. It would be sick if it wasn't so much fun. As if that wasn't enough, the young heroine still participates in the best action scenes of the entire film.
The soundtrack is another highlight, betting on funky songs by Primal Scream, The Omen, The Dickies, Joan Jett and Mika that manage to bring their target audience even closer together. It is also highlighted by the photography of Ben Davis, the production designer of Russell De Rozario and the costume of Sammy Sheldon who managed to leave a lighter tone and cartunesco that perfectly match the black humor and contrast with a general realistic tone of the production. The action scenes directed by Vaughn are another great highlight, especially when Hit-Girl saves our hero from a bunch of mobsters and the whole final act when the same Hit-Girl invades her enemy's office to finish the job that if her father had begun having to face dozens of mobsters. This entire final sequence is spectacular and stands out among the great action scenes of recent years in the cinema.
The film is so wide-open and debauched, that scenes like a ""live"" torture or a little girl slaughtering her enemies, ""amuse"" in their nearly two hours of unbridled action and everyday comedy scenes. And with a high-level edition, a quirky color and an uncompromising but current script, Kick Ass is the perfect antithesis of the hero: without powers, there is no responsibility. And even in the midst of a world of eccentric characters, Kick-Ass manages to keep his foot in reality thanks to Vaughn's calibrated direction and great production design, which completely destonates all the weirdness of the costumes. Innovative, energetic and absurdly fun, Kick-Ass is one of the best adaptations of recent comics, and also one of the best satirical works performed by Hollywood in recent years."

","Kick-Ass works surprisingly well, and was a huge surprise when I saw it a few years ago. I have seen it a few times since then, and I always come away having had a thoroughly good time.<br/><br/>The acting from everyone is great, but the main standouts were clearly Aaron Taylor Johnson as Kick-Ass, Chloë Grace Moretz as Hit Girl, Christopher Mintz-Plasse as Red Mist, Mark Strong as Frank D'Amico, and Nicholas Cage as Big Daddy. They all play off each other extremely well, and I was invested in all of their storylines.<br/><br/>Kick-Ass never takes itself too seriously, but instead focuses on what would actually happen if people in our world decided to take up the superhero mantle. The Hit Girl character is the main exception, because it would be highly unlikely that a young girl could pull of what she was managing to do, but everything else seemed to be realistic to a certain extent.<br/><br/>The action is handled incredibly well, and that's all thanks to the fabulous direction by Matthew Vaughn. He usually manages to blend compelling narratives with thrilling action scenes and engaging character interactions, and Kick-Ass is no exception.<br/><br/>The scene where the title character gets kidnapped with Big Daddy is extremely tense and I loved it, but my favourite part is the over-the-top ending. Like I said, it never takes itself too seriously, but manages to keep an air of realism to it and the entire film was thoroughly entertaining from start to finish.<br/><br/>Kick-Ass doesn't break any new ground, and I can see how it won't appeal to some people, but I loved it and will continue to watch it well into the future.<br/><br/>SCORE: 88%"

Not to mention Nicolas Cage's performance as a shotgun blasting Batman from hell.

"truemythmedia","6","0","0","10 September 2019"," Great Story
","The first time I saw this ""Kick Ass,"" I really enjoyed it and would have rated it around 4 stars. I was younger, hadn't been to film school and some of its lesser qualities were lost on me.<br/><br/>Now, while I still appreciate a lot of this film's better qualities, the bad acting especially bothers me. Chloe Grace Moretz (""Suspiria"" (2018)) is a fine actress but her portrayal of Hit Girl is so over the top that even in an over the top film. It has me cringing almost constantly. I know that will rub some of the fans of this movie the wrong way because Hit Girl is a very popular part of why people love ""Kick Ass"" What can I say? That's just how I feel about it.<br/><br/>She is not the only offender here either. Aaron Taylor-Johnson's performance leaves a lot to be desired. He's great as Kick Ass but as Dave, he's boring and uninspired. I suppose that could be intentional but I suspect not. The scenes between him and high school love interest who thinks he's gay but falls for him anyway, Lyndsy Fonseca (""Hot Tub Time Machine""), are just one bad actor grabbing desperately for something authentic from another bad actor trying to recite their lines at the same time as they try to portray emotion. Y'know. They try acting.<br/><br/>Luckily, the day is saved by Nic Cage (""Mandy"") and to a lesser extent Christopher Mintz-Plasse (""Superbad""), both of them turning in a couple of my favorite of their performances ever.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage plays Big Daddy, a former cop seeking revenge for his wife's murder by the mob. He has an impressive arsenal at his disposal and has schooled his young daughter Mindy to become Hit Girl, a sort of Robin to his Batman. Literally, Cage runs around in a Batman costume cutting down baddies with shotguns, pistols, and grenades like he's the grim reaper swinging his scythe.<br/><br/>Yeah. Don't let the comic book veneer fool you. This is a hard R for violence. It is, however, meant to be played for humor most of the time as evidenced by the inspired Nic Cage crazy acting choice to do an Adam West Impression(Batman from the 60s TV series) whenever he is in costume.<br/><br/>Therein lies my nitpick issue with the film, though. While on the one hand the high concept pitch is amazing and grounded: high school kid with no powers tries to be a superhero but doesn't have super powers; on the other hand it is in no way a grounded film, He literally flies a jet pack with mini-guns on it at one point and hit-girl is quite literally doing Wuxia martial arts moves complete with wire work.<br/><br/>Which is it? Should we be laughing or empathizing? When Kick Ass first tries to fight crime he almost gets murdered when one of the thugs simply stabs him and they all beat the snot out of him, breaking his bones to pieces and sending him into rehab after an ambulance trip. Yet, it doesn't seem like we are really supposed to feel at all bad about all the other violence in the film or emotional disturbance and apparent mental illness in the film. I suppose that mix is what makes it fun but it also rubs me wrong a little bit so I think the balance is just slightly off for me. Like I said, a nitpick.<br/><br/>The story really is the star here. Even almost 10 years later, this film still seems to have twists, turns, humor, and tender moments which play off common superhero tropes. I'm not sure how much of that is due to the movie's staying power or how much is because superhero films have evolved so little in the last ten years. Regardless, it's still fun and fresh feeling and a worthy addition to any comic book movie junkie's watch queue."
"ronakkotian","8","0","0","8 September 2019"," A great mixture of action, comedy and drama
","I heard of Kick-Ass for a long time and when I finally got the chance, I saw it. What can I say? I enjoyed this film throughout its entirety. This is a popcorn flick that remains humourous and fun all the way through.<br/><br/>Kick-Ass tells the story of Dave, a comic book lover who wants to become a superhero but arrives into trouble with a man known as Frank D'Amico. In a parallel story, two other people want to exact revenge from D'Amico after what he did to them.<br/><br/>In our lives, we must have thought at least once how much fun it would be to become a superhero. This simple idea is what makes Kick-Ass so relatable. From the opening, I connected with the protagonist as I shared the same thought. The writing in this film is so good. Jane Goldman and Matthew Vaughn make the film feel as realistic as possible. The opening also sets the tone. This film isn't meant to be taken seriously and both writers capitalise on that aspect really well. The jokes are hilarious and keep this film from being a bore. The characters are simple but well realised and the motivations for each one makes sense. Vaughn's direction has a lot of style. The action sequences are shot really well and are awesome to witness.<br/><br/>The acting is brillant. Aaron Taylor-Johnson seems like a high school teen and portrays both Kick-Ass and Dave well. Mark Strong did a good job as the villain. I always remembered Christopher Mintz-Plasse as Fogell from Superbad but he managed to shrug off that label here. The two best parts of the movie hand down were Chloë Grace Moretz and Nicolas Cage. Both of them did a tremendous job with their roles.<br/><br/>Whilst the film is very funny and contains stellar action, the first half feels a bit slow but it does pick up during the second half. The film is predictable and towards the end there were some cliché elements but at the same time, there is so much entertainment that you're ready to forgive these issues.<br/><br/>Kick-Ass is a wonderful experience. It definitely feels refreshing after seeing the abundance of other serious superhero flicks. The characters are well written, the acting is great, the premise is innovative and is just a delightful, hilarious movie that can be watched many times."

","Fed up with the complacency of everyone around him towards spiraling crime, a teenager decides to become a superhero in this well-paced mix of comedy and action from 'Kingsman' director Matthew Vaughn. Long before winning a Golden Globe for his scary performance in 'Nocturnal Animals', Aaron Taylor-Johnson is well cast as the near polar opposite protagonist who narrates his adventures with wit and fun pop culture references. The film also takes a surprisingly down-to-earth approach towards his quest as he only ends up being as effective as a superhero without skills, training, weaponry and powers would be. This down-to- earth air sadly evaporates as Nicolas Cage and Chloë Grace Moretz enter the picture as father and daughter trained superheroes. Both Cage and Moretz are a lot of fun to watch though with great banter and repartee and therefore it is hard to resent these less realistic characters coming into focus. Moretz steals every scene that she is in and while some blaring songs subtract from the immediacy of her combat scenes, she makes for a convincingly dangerous character despite her sweet looks. Much of the action here might be over-the-top, but with the comedic potential of the action so deliberately pronounced, it is easy to sit back and enjoy this speculative take on what might happen if more ordinary citizens chose to fight back."
"CinematicInceptions","8","0","0","18 September 2016"," ...which would be fine if bad guys were make-believe too.
","I must say that I was a little disappointed by this movie, but that's kind of okay because Dave is fueled throughout by his disappointment. It's rare to see a character motivated by disappointment in other people ""wishing they could help"", but it is perhaps the strongest aspect of the story. We only see a couple glimpses of Dave's pre-Kick Ass life, and it's nothing short of dull from his breakfast cereal to his purple bedroom. And while it's kind of funny to see his lame life play out with cynical undertones, it's not what we paid to see. Plus, we lose none of the humor after Dave starts pursuing life as a superhero.<br/><br/>In some ways he's both more and less inspiring than regular superheroes. One thing I love about super movies is those moments when they make their first rescue or overcome some problem that they have concerning their powers like when Bruce Wayne overcomes his fear of bats or when Magneto learns to employ his power through ways other than just anger. And Dave never quite has a moment like that. But what makes him more inspiring is his self-motivation and blind courage. If I had gadgets at my disposal or could climb walls or had inhuman reflexes, fighting crime would become something of a pastime. But as a regular human, there is no way I would go out looking to get on the bad side of criminals. The fact that Dave just goes out there and does that with no thought of the consequences is really cool, even though they don't make a big deal out of it.<br/><br/>I found that the back half was a little less enjoyable because they had to introduce dramatic elements to it. Normally this is fine, and it wasn't that big of a problem here either. But I started losing interest a little once Red Mist turned up. But that part of the story provided some new points to like. Dave goes through the necessary conflict of wanting to remain Kick-Ass but also stay alive for Katie's sake. While this is a pretty standard plot device, it is nonetheless a realistic one. Getting tangled up with Big Daddy, Hit Girl, and Red Mist also introduces regret of his decision into Dave's life. And we start to see the broader impact that the existence Kick Ass has with Frank D'Amico killing the one impersonator and the couple of scenes with Dave's friends.<br/><br/>The action style was undeniably different, but not that much better than your typical action flick. It was impressive considering that the budget was pretty small for an action movie, and I also watched it after having seen the much more impressive action in Kingsmen. Of course, Dave doesn't get to do any cool action stunts, but Big Daddy and Hit Girl definitely compensate in that regard. There was more gun-fighting than I would have liked. Explosions and such are fine for adrenaline, but I tend more towards the personal conflicts that you get from hand to hand duels. There is a little of that in the climax with Hit Girl and Frank D'Amico, and it wouldn't really make sense for Dave to have that kind of confrontation since he has no personal stake in his life as Kick Ass. His personal battle is won just by the fact that he takes part in the fight.<br/><br/>I had hoped that there would be a little more comedy in the action, but there was plenty of it in other places. Dave's two friends were a lot of fun to watch, and several characters had some great one-liners. It also takes advantage of some of the tropes found in superhero movies like having Dave's first superhero task involve almost literally rescuing a kitten from a tree. My two other favorite moments are when he gets hit by the car and the locker cliché with Katie that totally calls out the 2002 Spiderman movie.<br/><br/>This is definitely a refreshing take on the superhero genre, and it basically lives up to it's conceptual originality. The acting is good and nothing more. The script is above average and gets a little inventive. It's geared toward a relatively young audience, so it might come off as immature. Perhaps this is valid, but it's still a well done work of art. I haven't seen the sequel, but I feel like this is one of those movies that deserves to stand alone so as to retain its originality. A sequel would have ruined the effect of a movie like Forrest Gump or Ferris Bueller, and I think the same applies here. It may not be a very intelligent movie, but it does succeed in being entertaining and even a little more. Overall Rating: 8.3/10."

","A thrilling, amusing & refreshing delight, Kick-Ass is an exuberantly violent, unabashedly profane & genuinely hilarious extravaganza that's cleverly crafted, furiously paced & brilliantly performed and isn't just one of the best films of its year but also ranks amongst the better examples of its genre.<br/><br/>Kick-Ass tells the story of a high-school loner who aspires to be a real-life superhero and, one day, decides to go ahead with his dream despite having no power, no training & no meaningful reason behind it, and finds unlikely allies in a ""father-daughter duo with an agenda"" while fighting crime on his own.<br/><br/>Co-written & directed by Matthew Vaughn, Kick-Ass is a wild ride from start to finish. Its premise is ridiculous, its blood-filled action is over-the-top, its profanity level is off the charts, and yet it is difficult to look away from it because it pretty much nails the basic aspects of storytelling & packs an interesting set of characters.<br/><br/>The script is no slouch either. The story is compelling from start to finish and sufficient depth is provided to relevant characters, thus allowing the viewers to get on board with their journey. Technical aspects are expertly executed too and play a vital role in uplifting the overall experience by extensively refining its visual design.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, the cast comprises of Aaron Johnson, Chloë Grace Moretz, Nicholas Cage, Mark Strong & Christopher Mintz Plasse, and all of them deliver fab performances in their respective roles and bring their colorful characters to life with rigor but, in the end, it's Grace Moretz who steals the show, that too with effortless ease.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Kick-Ass is a stylishly directed, deftly written, richly photographed, tightly edited, viciously paced & smartly witted action comedy that's filled with so many pleasant surprises that it ends up delivering much more than what was expected from it. Offering quality entertainment & scoring high on satisfaction meter, it is a thoroughly rambunctious & endlessly fun ride that's worth your time & money. In short, Kick-Ass kicks ass!"

","A really good film. Shows us how hard, weird, and funny it would be to try to be a superhero in real life- From scratch. Not radioactive spider, or somekind of alien heritage. The acting was good, even very good despite the comedic nature of the film (Since comedy films usually don't have believable acting). I would have given 10/10 if they had focused a bit more on the subject of ""I'm weak, what should I do?"" In the film instead of going just ""Kickass"", since in the film Kickass meets HitGirl and Big Daddy and realizes he is a super- noob. A bit of training session or at least self-defense sessions for our MC would've improve the film. And the ending was a bit over the top unlike the rest of the film. I think they could have done a better ending with the explosions they wanted to finish the film off. (I wont say exactly what the ending is, because I don't want to spoil it but it involves unrealistic explosives)<br/><br/>Great film, I advise to everybody to watch it. Acting is very good (For a comedy film), the story is nice and doesn't feel too slow or fast (Although the exposition might not be THAT interesting for everyone and it will feel like slow story progression, but I enjoyed it.)"

","OK so if you're going into kick-ass expecting it to be on par with movies like ""citizen kane"" and "" there will be blood"" then wtf is wrong with you. By its name alone you know this isn't going to be some great masterpiece of the 21st century cinematic experience, but you should at least go into it with the hopes of just having a good time watching a movie. And trust me, most people will have a blast with this one. It's funny, very violent in a stylistic way, and overall pretty well shot when it comes to action and fighting scenes. The main character becoming a masked vigilante is handled in a comical but non-cheesy way, and overall the characters in this movie always add something to the experience when they are on screen, whether it be Nic Cage's role as the sweet but batsh!t father (I mean come on you should be sold on this movie by the fact alone that ole Nic is here ready to spread some crazy acting cheer), or the main character's nerdy but hilarious best friends. <br/><br/>So that's a quick and basic summary of what I did like, now on to the issues. If you are madly in love with this movie and are going to hate someone else criticize it then this is where you should walk away from your keyboard and put your butt-plug back in. OK so first off the first scene of this movie is a dude jumping off a building to his death. Yeah not sure if that's a spoiler or not. Anyways, the way he landed after he feel is completely impossible (trust me I'm a scientist and nobody on the internet ever lies). Like I diagrammed it out and I'm pretty certain he couldn't have possibly landed the way he did. OK so that's more of a nitpick, so here's my real issues. This movie does one of those love story things. It's meant to be funny, but there comes a point where the characters act all lovey dovey and their dialogue is so cringe worthy and clichéd that I have no idea why it was put into the movie to begin with. Like seriously, I'm glad we got a minute long scene consisting of ""I care about you babe."", ""no babe, I care about YOU"". The movie also uses the 28 days/weeks later theme song during a fight scene, and it just feels completely out of place and awkward, at least to me. I'm sure some people will enjoy it. Alright rapping this semi-rant up, another spoiler is inbound. So during the end the characters fly away in a jetpack. This is fine and all, but the animators forgot to CGI cars onto the ground. Like one shot the street is empty, and then the next shot its completely filled with traffic. Like that's just bad attention to detail. So that's about it. This movie is what it wants to be and for the most part it is well done. I'd recommend it to any casual movie viewer wanting to have a fun movie night. 7.5/10"

"TxMike","Null","0","0","12 September 2015"," My reason to see it was Chloë Grace Moretz as Hit-Girl.
","Somewhere recently I was reading a column regarding Moretz in some movie, I believe 'Hugo', and the writer made a comment to the effect, by the time 'Hugo' hits the theaters many fans will already be familiar with her as the trained assassin in 'Kick-Ass'. That surprised me considering her more recent roles. Fortunately my public library stocks the Blu-Ray versions of both 'Kick-Ass' and 'Kick Ass 2' so I was able to view both of them within a few days. <br/><br/>The BD extras are very interesting, showing how the movie was bridged quickly from the early success of the comic book 'Kick-Ass'. Moretz was still very young, 11 when she started the role, and much of the charm of the movie is this little girl dressed up in her costume and with purple wig, and having all the fighting skills. Moretz is very good in this role. The 'K.A. 2' was made 4 years later, according the the BD commentary, so at 14 to 15 she looks quite a bit more grown up and through that the second loses a lot of its charm.<br/><br/>The basic premise is that Aaron Taylor (British actor sounding a lot like Toby Maguire) is Dave Lizewski, a mild-mannered teen with no particular physical skills. But with his geeky friends starts to wonder, with so many superhero comics and movies over the years why hasn't someone in real life actually come out to be one, to fight crime in New York City? So without telling his friends he orders a costume and decides he will become Kick-Ass. His first real encounter doesn't go well, he is beaten and stabbed almost to death but recovers, and damage to his nerve endings later help him endure pain.<br/><br/>Nick Cage has a neat role as Mr Macready who with his Batman-like costume fights crime as 'Big Daddy.' His young daughter is Chloë Grace Moretz as Hit-Girl, or for her proper name, Mindy Macready. In essence her childhood has been stolen in her training but she is a very effective assassin. But only for the bad guys!<br/><br/>I mostly enjoyed the movie for the three characters I mentioned. Especially Moretz as the Hit-Girl. But really, there is an awful lot of gory violence, and I understand that is faithful to the comic book, yet seeing real people (actors) portraying this is often a bit much. I know a lot of fans can't get enough of it but I find it a bit too much, plus the really offensive language many characters are required to use, including young Moretz. <br/><br/>I'm glad I saw it, I enjoyed seeing young Moretz in this extreme role, but it is not the type of movie I'd own."

","the best part about this movie are the action scenes, mainly the ones involving big daddy and hit girl. but what this movie lacked most was an intriguing plot. it also wasn't as funny as I expected, and while it wasn't expected to be good, the acting was sub par. i know mark strong could've done better, especially early on in the movie, which, with good acting, would've established frank damico as a more sinister villain. the love story that developed between dave and kate was relatively good, though, and I was disappointed to learn that they break up in the second movie. I really liked the occasional comic book storytelling or transition, though, and again, the action was great, but his best friends are only occasionally there for comic relief and are pretty much useless. but in my opinion, the worst part is his ease with the concept of killing. he doesn't kill for the entire movie, yet he does it with the gatling gun on the jetpack without contemplating what he was doing. and he never questions why an 11 year old would be killing in the first place. one of the central themes of superhero movies is the justification to kill and this movie completely glazes over it."

All of the actors in this movie did a great job, especially the lead who did a fantastic job of going from cool Englishmen in real life to a dorky lil high schooler.

","I just got out of the cinema and I am ... stunned, stupefied, blown away by this picture which came out of nowhere and rocks everything away of 2010 so far ( even the admired GhostWriter or ShutterIsland ).<br/><br/>The most interesting about the film would be that it came to us and all I knew was the silly front picture with Kick-ass on it and ... yeah ... I thought ""What the Hell ???"". Two days later I was sitting in the cinema in one of the first screenings with zero expectations and hoped the film would do what one needs on a Friday evening: To entertain.<br/><br/>All I can say: IT DID MORE THAN THAT<br/><br/>The first 30 to 40 minutes are a funny introduction into the characters that don't take themselves to serious; mainly Dave Lizewski ( portrayed by a convincing Aaron Johnson ) who is ""just a regular guy"". Later we get to know the best Father-Daughter duo in a long time: Big Daddy ( an excellent Nicolas Cage ) and *tatatata* HIT-GIRL ( a brilliant newcomer: Chloe Moretz ). Antagonists are Marc Strong ( who started off with films like ""Body of Lies"" or ""Stardust"" ) with one of his best performances yet and a good Christopher Mintz-Plasse to complete the cast. During this introduction-time the cinematography and atmosphere simply is one of the best in a long time.<br/><br/>After this, the film starts to roll on, the laughs ( every joke sits perfectly ! ) get a little less and the director shows that he's able to shoot action scenes better than in many action films ( I haven't seen such breath-taking action scenes since The Bourne Ultimatum ).<br/><br/>The film is full of small allusions to many other films: like comic-adaptations ( of course Batman, Spider-man or Superman ), but also other big, big movies ( like Star Wars, Scarface or Taxi Driver ).<br/><br/>If that weren't enough, one also has to talk about the soundtrack who simply kicks ass. A great variety of all different sorts of music ( Prodigy to Morricone to Classical Music ) picked to underline every single scene perfectly and really setting a mood for all the film. <br/><br/>One thing that would still have to be said would be a warning for all the parents who want to take their 12-year-old comic-loving son to the film: forget it ! The R-rating is appropriate, VERY appropriate. But for everyone else, I recommend to see this cinematic surprise, take all your friends, family, etc.<br/><br/>KICK-ASS IS ASS-SOME"

WRONG! This movie is a prime example of the bandwagon effect. People can't really think this is a good movie...it's just that someone they know said it was and they're too afraid to think for themselves. Then, it repeats itself over and over.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend skipping this movie if you want to keep your brain cells intact."
"ashnr19","1","5","16","13 August 2010"," The worst movie I've seen recently
","When I saw the previews for this film I was unimpressed and was absolutely going to skip it. However, after seeing some of the high reviews it got here at IMDb and elsewhere I thought I would give it a try and rent it. I am disappointed I spent a dollar to rent this film. It is by far one of the worst movies I've ever seen. If there was a movie responsible for the dumbing down of American culture this would be it.<br/><br/>First of all this movie is rated R yet panders to teenagers and young adults. It is appropriate for neither. The content and subject matter are immature even for the comic book culture. This movie is poor all the way around. Horrible acting, awful screenplay, dumb montages, and poor theme. I would recommend this film to no one. There are much more things worthy of your time. Read some real literature. Watch an actual film. This garbage of a movie will only make you dumber.<br/><br/>I am doubly upset by the fact that it gets such a high rating here and in my local newspaper the San Francisco Chronicle. In fact, I have been using IMDb for years now but only registered recently in order to bring this false rating down. This is NOT a good movie and should be rated accordingly. Wake up people! The fact that it has received the ratings it has is disturbing to say the least. Our culture is in danger when a film like this gets good reviews. It becomes all too clear when a movie like this gets approved for a sequel what America and our society is all about, greed and money over morals, decency, and ethics. People who like this movie have attention spans that can only be measured in nanoseconds or are not old enough to have seen this R rated film. I hold movies like this responsible for the dumbing down of America. The fact that it has such a high rating is a bad sign indeed."

It's like Pirates of the Caribbean - Orlando and Kira were heroes, but everyone thought it was Depp. :) Girl's role was splendid.

"BooHoo7902","9","5","16","2 May 2010"," Surprised...but in one hell of a good way!
","I began watching this film with the frame in my mind that it was simply going to be another spoof-style comedy film, similar to that of Superheroe movie which was rather bad. By the end of the movie, I was in fact rather shocked at how much I did enjoy it. A first in a while I must admit! The character casting was perfect. Aaron Johnson's debut was fantastic, I didn't even realise it was him at first! If I had known beforehand I more than likely would have been slightly dubious, but it worked well. Christopher Mintz-Plasse's role also did work well, however I thought he would have been involved much earlier in the story than what happened. I previously watched Chloe Moretz in '(500) Days of Summer' and with her having such a small role I didn't know whether or not she would be able to pull off such a character she is portraying. Again, proved wrong! She fitted like a glove and I really couldn't see anyone else playing such a stronger role. When I realised Nicholas Cage was involved, like Johnson, I was slightly unsure about whether the 'serious' tone of his previous acting (due to many of the cast being more young-newer faces) would kind of wash out the film but it didn't.<br/><br/>The certificate however I thought was a bit risky for UK cinemas and think it would have deserved more of an 18 rating, compared to 15. The violence in it was rather graphic, which I did find a bit off putting at times, but then again, I wasn't really expecting the more gang-violent crime that was involved within the story.<br/><br/>Overall, it was a fresh new film which I think was seriously needed in the films of today as FAR too many re-makes keep being regurgitated onto the cinema screens! If you like violence, a bit of humour and something new...then Kick-Ass will blow your mind!"

"Chris_BS1212","8","5","16","25 April 2010"," With no major studio backing comes an original take on the superhero genre
","Kick-Ass is probably the most purely entertaining film of the year. It has memorable characters, a good script and a great premise from which it builds a formidable film. Kick-Ass is directed by Matthew Vaughn whose Layer Cake showed what potential he had as a director after sometime working mainly as a producer. Here in his adaptation of Mark Millar's comic book he's taken a premise that it is hard to believe no one has used before and built a superb film around it. Set, to start with, in a relatively realistic world we meet Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson), who as we're told by a slightly patronising voice over is your typical teenager who wonders why no one every tried being a superhero before. His two best friends Marty and Todd quickly shoot down his idea telling him how ridiculous it would be. Case in point the film opens with an apparent superhero taking a swan dive off a skyscraper spreading his ""wings"" before promptly landing face first into a taxi. That's why.<br/><br/>But Dave is convinced he can do it, he goes ebay and buys a costume and sets out to fight crime. His first effort goes horrifically wrong as he's beaten to within an inch of his life by two low life hustlers. There is plenty of dark humour, especially early on in this film. Undeterred and with metal reinforcing some of his bones a la wolverine and destroyed nerve endings he sets out again and manages to take down three thugs in a protracted, messy, amateurish fight. This is captured on a mobile phone and before long the video is on youtube and Kick-Ass is a national phenomenon.<br/><br/>In a much less realistic realm that the film moves into, smoothly I might add, exist Hit-Girl and Big Daddy. These two, particular the former , overshadow Kick-Ass despite having less of the screen time. Chloe Moretz is a revelation as the 12 year old who has been trained, pretty much from birth, by her father (Nicholas Cage) to be a costumed vigilante. The action sequences which these two are involved in are fantastic and one in particular late in the film is bound to get the adrenaline running as Hit-Girl takes on an entire mob single handedly set to the theme from Sunshine, this was one of the best action sequences I've seen in a while. There is great humour in the relationship between these two as well, particularly in an early scene as Cage shoot Moretz in the chest so that she can learn to take a bullet is probably the funniest in the film.<br/><br/>At first it is difficult to see where these two story lines might come together but that's where Frank D'Amico, Mark Strong on fantastic form as he always seems to be, comes in. Frank is the head of the mob that Big Daddy has targeted. As Hit-Girl and Big Daddy work there way through the lower ranks of Frank's men all the information that he gets is that some costumed vigilante is responsible, he concludes it is Kick-Ass. This sets the plot hurtling towards the inevitable conclusion although there are some great sparks of originality along the way.<br/><br/>Kick-Ass is a good film full of great moments of humour and action, it was hard not to smile when Ennio Morricone's comes on in a final scene as a blatant reference to Sergio Leone's westerns. There are flaws in this film, I'm not sure about how easily Kick-Ass gets the girl and the ending when all is said and done is very formulaic, not that this detracted from my enjoyment of those scenes, indeed it is hard to see how or indeed why Vaughn would want to make this film any other way."

Do Not take your kids it has lots of violence and some bad language and sex, well deserving of R rating.<br/><br/>Thank goodness the trailers have not given too much away with this movie.

Ohh and he also Produced this movie so he should be reaping some major bank for this.<br/><br/>Aaron Johnson was OK in this movie. Christopher Mintz-Plasse was his dorky self. Nicolas Cage did great in a medium size role. But it was 13 year old Chole Moretz who stole this movie, stabbed it then set it on fire! <br/><br/>The movie is full of clever lines, comic fanfare and even pokes fun of superhero movies.

","You know, a funny little thing happened on the way to see this film at the theatre. My friend drove me and he's a rough driver. For the whole trip, the car would go fast, then slow, stop quickly, and make sharp curves; all while loud music (mostly rock and rap) was playing. Relaxing in the car was impossible. Why am I telling you this? Because ""Kick-Ass"" is one of those flicks that also dares you to relax. In fact, it might as well put a gun to your head and dare you. I sure as hell don't mean this in a bad way, though, because ""Kick-Ass"" delivers with its humour, fast-paced action, and general awesomeness. It doesn't work the entire time, but I got what I wanted: pure escapism.<br/><br/>I wish I could end the review right there, because this doesn't seem like the kind of film you should analyze and, instead, just enjoy with your buddies. Nonetheless, all films are fair game for reviewing. There are always reasons for liking or disliking a film. (Captain Obvious could tell you that.) So, let's dig deeper.<br/><br/>We meet Dave Lizewski, a geeky high school student who decides to become a vigilante superhero, like in the comics. Well, not quite, as he doesn't have any superpowers or training. Still, he buys a green suit online and gives it a go. After trying to fight two car jacking thugs, one stabs him and he subsequently gets hit by a car in an amusing manner because of how unlucky he is. However, his luck changes for the better as he gets out of the hospital with nerve damage giving him the ability to not feel pain and his bones have been repaired with metal plates. Therefore, he tries again. One night, he walks around in public wearing his suit (lol) and finds some more thugs beating someone. This time, Dave successfully fights them off and since the fight is videotaped, his alter ego Kick-Ass becomes an overnight sensation and, well, the story has just begun.<br/><br/>There are so many funny lines and moments that it would be ridiculous to name them all. The humour skews towards the kind you'd find in a Tarantino film; black. Right at the beginning of ""Kick-Ass"", a superhero wannabe jumps off of a tall building attempting to fly and, instead, plummets to his death. That immediately tells you this isn't gonna be a feel-good comedy. I have to admit I laughed at that, too. The most memorable scenes probably come from Mindy/Hit-Girl and her father Damon/Big Daddy. They're the utmost unusual parent-child pairing I think I've ever seen in a movie. Damon, played excellently by Nicolas Cage, trains Mindy to be a killing machine. This makes Mindy, herself, to be really bizarre for a child. In one scene, she cuts up a bunch of bad guys in a room, which is amazingly hyperreal and funny. It might even slightly remind you of the infamous restaurant fight scene in ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"".<br/><br/>""Kick-Ass"" is stylish, but also has substance. I found Dave and his friends to be relatable, since I actually have friends like them, including the guy who drove me. Mindy and Damon are given a backstory that's shown through a superbly animated comic. In spite of the film's unique quality, another film came out recently called ""Defendor"", also about a superhero wannabe, starring Woody Harrelson. I personally like that film more because it's abundant with humanity and I didn't feel overwhelmed during the last quarter as I unfortunately did with ""Kick-Ass"". The grand conclusion and the scenes prior to it didn't amuse or thrill me quite like the rest of the film. They're even sort of predictable. The good news is those are the only real complaints I have.<br/><br/>""Kick-Ass"" is based on a series of comics, which I haven't read. Regardless, the film feels like it was written and directed by movie lovers. Props go to all the actors for helping to make it come alive. I'm going to close with a clichéd pun, but I don't give a f**k: ""Kick-Ass"" kicks ass."

","Kick Ass is a superhero movie, and while it offers a satirical first act of what a superhero is, it rolls out as a true action movie by the time your watching the opening credits.<br/><br/>That being said, you haven't seen this movie before. The situations are going to seem familiar, but the character are all brand new, especially the little 11 year old that takes the spotlight, Hit Girl brings in what I would like to guess is the next big Character Archetype. Now you've had little girls, and you've had bad ass little girls, Hit Girl fits into Bad ass little girl, but way different than before. She says a few bad words at the start, but it seems like that quickly dies out before the opening. What is not changed is that she is in the scenes were the most gratuitous violence is depicted and she is almost always the one committing gratuitous violence.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage works surprisingly perfect as a satire of Batman, and he ties in what unfortunately is probably a largely missed joke. Not going to spoil it here though.<br/><br/>Ultimately, it sets off as a spoof, and works its way backwards into being one of the most awesome movies you're likely to see this year, and definitely the best so far this year.<br/><br/>9/10"

","Need of escape of the real world? Try comic books. Need of a local super hero? Count on Kick-Ass! Here you have a teen named Dave Lizweski (Aaron Johnson), quiet, awkward, invisible to girls who has an obsession with comic books. He lives with his father, after his mother died at the breakfast table, he descends into total silence with himself. It took some reading of comic books which would make him something interesting; a superhero. But his friends thinks he's out there. Maybe. But one day when he and his pal get robbed, Dave goes into this mode that changes his persona for the better of mankind: Kick-Ass. When he meets the same thugs, he gets attack and stabbed. The second time, he becomes a sensation of New York. After that, he inspires more people to become a superhero. A father(Nicholas Cage) and his daughter become HitGirl and Big Daddy. Hit Girl was total bad. She kills without remorse and so does her sidekick father. The result of that; police corruption that lead to his wife's death, and his imprisonment by a corrupt detective(Xander Berkley). When the heroes collide against the thugs, it's a blood fest waiting to happen. This movie has plenty of action, plenty of comedy, and plenty of crudeness which is not surprising. If you want to live your inner hero, check out Kick-Ass!! 5 stars!"

I told her it was violent, and she said that was okay.<br/><br/>We went and both really enjoyed the movie. It's funny and the plot is pleasantly twisty. The violence is there, and there's plenty of blood and beatings, but not as bad as the last violent movie I saw, Watchmen (also good). Hit Girl steals the show and the bad guys are entertaining and have some great lines.<br/><br/>On the other hand if you go to a movie actually titled KICK ASS and are offended by the violence - that's all on you, sorry."
"surgicalicu","4","4","12","9 May 2011"," Massively Over Rated
","This movie is hardly an 8/10 title as rated here on IMDb. I thought the plot was conflicted between lame comedy and sappy drama which was misplaced and inappropriate. Inconsistent moods alternated throughout the movie as we are asked to sympathize with the main character's loss of his dear mother while alternately laughing at the silly premise of his desire to become a super hero. The made for TV plot includes a battle with mafia drug dealers and a randomly inserted gun toting father-daughter duo which was shallow and made little sense. Add to this the thin racial subplots and indirect implications which the director had not the courage to place directly on screen. Laughs were sparse and clever dialog absent. The whole exercise is an MTV mentality simple minded cartoon for liberal minded kids and I would not waste my money if I were you."
"rbnn","3","4","12","30 August 2010"," Voice-over ruins movie
","One of the mysteries of modern mass media is why so many otherwise good films are ruined late in post-production by unnecessary add-ons. Whether it's Lucas throwing in cheesy special effects in a Star Wars re-release, or sitcom producers putting in laugh tracks, or unnecessary explanatory dialog, sometimes a producer's contempt for his audience seethes threw and ruins a film.<br/><br/>Here, what could have been a reasonable film was destroyed by an almost constant stream of unnecessary voice-over purporting to give character motivation and plot explanation. But the character motivation and plot motivation were already in the film! I don't think there has been such a bad voice-over of an otherwise good film since the theatrical release of Blade-Runner.<br/><br/>There is also excessive profanity in the film."

","So, for some time now, Jane Goldman has been the writer du jour for movies of the last five years, not surprisingly to great acclaim from her celebrity husband Jonathan Ross. Unfortunately (or fortunately for us) she has not turned out an original work of her own, but has turned other people's ideas and stories (Neil Gaiman, Stan Lee for example) into screen-friendly fare. So far, so run-of-the-mill.<br/><br/>Now it appears Mrs. Ross, teamed up with Matthew ""Layer Cake"" Vaughan to really strike out on their own, and produce something they can call theirs and no one else's.<br/><br/>They're welcome to it. If They want to take credit for films they haven't really written, then they can sure take the blame for this.<br/><br/>Was this film supposed to be funny? Because I sure as hell didn't laugh. Well, maybe once. When our eponymous character would rather be discovered naked in an alleyway than in his pseudo-costume. And that was about how I felt at this time. If anyone had called me and asked ""Watcha doin'"" I'd probably lie, and say, ""getting ass-raped by a gang of chavs"", rather than admit I was wasting my time with this.<br/><br/>It's not without it's merits, however few and poorly executed. The idea of real people taking up the cape of the ""superhero"" is maybe not new, but is still an intriguing angle. It's somewhere in the Watchmen vein, crossed with dirty sex comedy. But it's played all wrong. The laughs are not played for laughs (""funny"" deaths not funny and played down), and it's impossible to care for a single character, because, with the exception of one, they are all flawed, terrible people.<br/><br/>Nic Cage's Big Daddy is an insidious corrupter of his child, Hit-Girl. While this is addressed as an issue in the film, he learns nothing from it. Neither does Hit Girl. She continues to kill and kill and swear and kill. Also, does anyone remember the old ""1001"" cleaner adverts on UK TV, in which some kind of pseudo-Batman arrives at a spillage? That's Big Daddy's costume. I swear to God it is.<br/><br/>By the Way, Goldman and Vaughan - Having a 10 year old kid say ""C**T"" in a film is not edgy, clever film making. It's just pathetic and crass.<br/><br/>There's much I could say about this film. It has no heart, not moral, there's not much of a character arc for our hero, Kick-Ass. In fact, his decision to pack it all in and lead a normal life, after realising he's going to die if he carries on, is probably the smartest thing he does in the whole film. However, he goes straight back in, and learns nothing from his time as a vigilante.<br/><br/>The villain is one dimensional, his son ""Red Mist"" is just a scared, selfish spoiled kid who wants to play dress up, and uses his crime lord father's predicament to get the resources to. He very sharply turns into super-villain with no warning and no decent cause to.<br/><br/>Simply put - If this were a loaf of bread, it would have the right ingredients for a good recipe, but it's just not ready to come out of the oven. More pre-production work was needed to turn out a better story, flesh out characters better, Big Daddy excepted, the violence toned down a fraction and the appalling language from children erased. Then, this could have been quite a competitive film."

","The idea of this movie is not bad. Unfortunately, on the big screen, it fails totally due to the dispersal of the plot. This movie wants to be everything. Unfortunately, at the end, it's nothing but a ""pastiche"" of other movies like Batman, Léon, Matrix, Kill Bill or Sin City without their strength and personality. And because it is a copy or if you like, a kind of collage of other movies, the brutality and violence just seem to be misplaced, serving no purpose at all but the glorifying of violence itself.<br/><br/>A thing that bothered me was the (lack of) intention of the director, who seemed to need some direction himself. What was this all about actually? When the movie tried to be comical it was not funny. When it tried to be serious it was kind of comical-stupid. Violence a ""déjà vu"". Kick-Ass, the main character, seemed more like he was playing a secondary role??? <br/><br/>But there is another thing that is bothering me even more.

"dee.reid","10","4","12","19 May 2010"," ""Kick-Ass"" - No superpowers? No problem. But he can still kick your a**...
","""Kick-Ass"" is probably the most illogical logical comic book superhero movie ever made, and I say that in a good way. ""Kick-Ass"" takes the idea of the costumed superhero to its illogical, logical extremes by presenting us an everyday teenager named Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson), who takes his love of comic books a little too far and decides to become a real-life superhero, donning a costume out of a diving suit he bought off the Internet (eBay) and becoming embroiled in a deadly mob war as a result of his costumed theatrics.<br/><br/>And thus begins ""Kick-Ass,"" Matthew Vaughn's over-the-top, if not totally stream-lined (and dare I say, slightly ""sanitized""), adaptation of the comic book series created by Mark Millar and John Romita, Jr. for Marvel Comics, under the company's Icon imprint. I've read the first volume of ""Kick-Ass"" comics in preparation for this movie and while I think the comics were way better (largely because of how vulgar, over-the-top, satirical, and violent the comics were), the movie is not half-bad. In fact, it's very good, despite the many red-flags it's raising.<br/><br/>I laughed. My friend who was sitting beside me laughed, too. I laughed as blood and bodies hit the floor. I laughed as bad guys died horrible but fitting deaths. I laughed as a foul-mouthed 11-year-old girl slaughtered bad guys left & right. (Yes, you read that right, a foul-mouthed 11-year-old girl slaughters bad guys left & right.) I laughed at all the inappropriate times (there never is a real ""appropriate"" time to laugh at all during this picture.) I laughed at the utter insanity and absurdity of it all. (I laughed more-so at the comics, but that's a different matter altogether.)<br/><br/>Lizewski, like most superheroes in their ordinary civilian lives (such as Peter Parker/Spider-Man), is not popular with the girls, is the target of bullies and street muggers alike, and is a nerd who reads too many comic books. Despite not having any superpowers (he wasn't bitten by a radioactive spider and he's not a refugee from a dying alien planet), it's nonetheless a wonder that he soon dons the Kick-Ass suit and makes a name for himself by taking down a trio of gang members. A bystander records the action on his cell phone and uploads it to the Internet, where it goes viral and Kick-Ass becomes an instant media sensation with a legion of devoted followers and copycats, such as Chris D'Amico (Christopher Mintz-Plasse, of ""Superbad""), who soon takes to the streets as Red Mist. And that foul-mouthed 11-year-old girl I was telling you about? Her name is Cindy Macready a.k.a. Hit-Girl (Chloe Grace Moretz), who is waging a deadly father-daughter war on organized crime with her father Damon/Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage), a conflict that Kick-Ass is inevitably drawn into against his better judgment.<br/><br/>""Kick-Ass"" is a deliriously entertaining, if overly violent and totally un-PC superhero flick. The movie shows the ""real world"" of superheroes and the logical consequences of their actions, which can include serious bodily injury and death, as Our Hero Kick-Ass quickly finds out. (And I thought My Hero Peter Parker/Spider-Man had it rough.) While I disliked some of the changes (both minor and major) made for the movie from the comics, I can say that ""Kick-Ass"" makes those changes work, including the hilarious nature of Dave's unusual relationship with a pretty classmate named Katie Deauxma (Lyndsy Fonseca).<br/><br/>I honestly can't wait for the sequel. ""Kick-Ass"" kicks a**!<br/><br/>10/10"

","I don't often write reviews but I just have to write this. Chloe Moretz absolutely owns every scene she's in as Hit-Girl in this movie. Every word that comes out of her mouth exudes coolness. The squint, the sneer, the pauses between words, the gestures. Who taught her to do that? Who was her acting coach? And the scene in the bowling ally with Nic Cage, where she started laughing just before she told him she was just messing with him, that expression was priceless. And the way she said ""I never play"" before the final confrontation, that little bit of a Christopher Walken mannerism, that was exquisite. I've seen Angelina Jolie in Mr and Mrs Smith and Wanted and let me tell you, as good as Jolie is, she's got nothing on this kid. Watching her reminds me the first time I watched Clint Eastwood in A Fistful Of Dollar. I kept telling myself, this guy must be the coolest guy ever to appear on screen. His every little gesture is absolutely magnetic. That's how I felt when I watch Chloe Moretz in Kick-Ass. Sadly there won't be a sequel, or so I hope, as she has grown too old to reprise the role."

What drives this movie is pretty much people getting the crap beat out of them and how it can be both entertaining and funny. This movie pulls no punches in terms of violence and dialogue, especially when you watch a 12-year old girl slice up gangsters like cold cuts while using language that would make your mother cringe. I'm not sure who played Kick-Ass in this movie but Michael Cera and McLovin don't have the awkward teen market cornered anymore. This is a movie that's best enjoyed with a packed theater so go see it sooner than later and expect a grittier and ballsier super hero movie like Watchmen with more jokes and less blue penis."

Kick Ass isn't necessarily a better movie, but it's refreshing and pushes boundaries that need to be pushed. We need film makers to innovate, not to rely on re-hashing old stories and special effects.<br/><br/>Chloe Moretz is simply wonderful, in a role that must have been difficult to define based on the fact that there isn't really anything previous to go by. Mark Strong is an excellent adversary, and Nicolas Cage actually puts in a reasonable performance too.<br/><br/>Any film that can shock you whilst at the same time making you laugh and cry has to be commended. This story relies on great writing and acting to achieve that rare goal, not on gore and special effects.<br/><br/>This is not going to appeal to everyone, but I believe it is pure genius and if you aren't easily offended, buy the DVD because it's one to keep and watch over and over."

","Adaptation of 2008 creator-owned comic book of the same name, about a teenage boy (Johnson) who sets out to become a superhero. His actions are caught on camera, via witnesses' cellphones, and uploaded onto the internet, making him an inspiration. However, he soon gets pushed into the crossfire of an ongoing war between gangsters and ruthless vigilantes that are killing the thugs off one by one. The film starts out very promising, with real life obstacles as a major (and many times humorous) setback for the main character. However, what starts out as something comical and self-aware soon turns into a heartless tale of vigilantism. It's pretty much Marvel's answer to Christopher Nolan's Batman Trilogy, but it brings nothing new to heroism in the real world. The film soon begins focusing too much on the violence and cruelty of the world, rather than focusing on the main character's realization of why people choose not to become superheroes in the real world--an epiphany brought on by a more interesting sub-plot involving a crush who thinks he's gay. Still, the film hit the right spot for a lot of people, but not everyone. Just another example of why Marvel is inferior and shallow compared to DC.<br/><br/>*½ (out of four)"

","The last or previous super hero parody I had the displeasure to watch was ""Mystery Men""; I may be a William H. Macy and Janeane Garofalo fan but that movie sucked or at the very least had insufficient good parts to outweigh the many bad ones as far as I'm concerned. The rating, from the various source sites I refer to, was poor and the box office reflected pretty much that fact; it lost ""mucho dineros"".<br/><br/>Kick-Ass on the other hand was a pleasant surprise and fared much better considering thatwell, it's a parody. I wondered why it did, so a year after watching it, I had a second look. The cast was not extraordinary (except for Mark Strong being part of it), so I ruled that out as the reason. The storyline should have warranted a much lower attendance and in my case would be a turn-off. I pondered; then it came to me after a sugar rush: Word of mouth and early good ratings paved the way for it doing so well. In IMDb there are some 640 reviews of this movie prior to mine; now there's a fan base to be sure. Perhaps my review is superfluous, but since it is original and unique, I did not wish to deprive movie lovers from it. The well directed feature and professionally executed action scenes attracted a fan base sufficient to spread the word. It's a super hero parody that does not suck; therefore it's a pretty good one."

","This film is not for children. It's advertised for kids and it looks like children would watch it since the plot revolves around normal people trying to be superheroes. Well, it's definitely a film that shouldn't be seen by anyone younger than 18 years old. Chlöe Grace Moretz plays Hit-Girl, an 11 year-old Mindy who kills many, many people and uses very profane language.<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage is in the cast and mainly plays the anchor, as Mindy's dad. I wasn't thrilled about watching a film with Cage attached to the title, but, I heard rave reviews from friends and read critics views of it and had to check it out myself. Mostly, I wanted to see Lyndsy Forseca in a sexier and more body-revealing role. I recognized her name from playing the future daughter of Ted in How I Met Your Mother.<br/><br/>As far as the movie plot goes, it's quite interesting and engaging. It's a great premise because I've always thought that anyone could become a superhero, but no one ever does. It's something that's been on people's minds for years. It's quite realistic in the way of showing violence against these ""heroes."" It's great to see that the screenwriter and director can follow the comic book loyally while keeping realistic.<br/><br/>No one becomes a superhero and has no consequences. Kick-Ass almost gets killed, Hit-Girl has trauma happen to her, and the realism piles up. I enjoyed the action sequences and found myself on the edge of my seat during the climatic battle. I also found myself cheering for Cage at a moment, which I've never really cared for his characters.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed the relationship between Katie and Dave (Aaron Johnson). I thought it was quite romantic and I thought the tender moment in her bedroom was realistic while still being romantic and funny in a quirky way. It's great to see Chlöe kick major ass in all her scenes. I liked the character, regardless of all the killings and language she uses.<br/><br/>Kick-Ass is great comic book movie that is different from all other comic book movies. It's also a very good movie on it's own. But I can only recommend this to audiences over 18 years old."

One day he gets the bright idea to become a superhero but of course he doesn't have any special powers but his alter ego Kick-Ass hits the streets where he going to get beat to a pulp but soon a father (Nicolas Cage) and his daughter (Chloe Moretz) show up to lend a hand in bringing down a gangster. If you take this movie very serious then you're probably going to end up hating it like Roger Ebert did. I really can't blame anyone for not wanting to watch an 11-year-old girl kill multiple people and getting beaten to a pulp. Seeing kids killing or being abused isn't very entertaining but there's just something so weird, surreal and rather original about this movie that it works somehow. I personally can't think of another movie like this one and that's something hard to find and that reason alone makes this a must-see as long as you can put up with the subject matter. I think what makes the film work so well is that it really does take place in a real world where our ""heroes"" wear the funny costumes but they don't contain any super human strength or special powers. As much as one can enjoy comic book movies it's always common sense that you're watching something fake. That fakeness is pretty much taken away here and we're left with a rather realistic movie that manages to work because of how natural it is. I loved the scenes early on when Kick-Ass first goes out to clean up the streets only to get his head bashed in and nearly lose his life because he's simply not tough. It gets even better when the kids soon begins to build his strength as he finally gets the girl of his dreams only because there's a rumor going around school that he's gay and she wants a gay best friend. Even funnier is a few earlier scenes where Dave, soon to be Kick-Ass, talks about his pathetic life, which is nothing more than comics and looking at porn. All of these scenes come off very realistic and I thought the movie did a great job at making sure the characters here were humans first of all. It's the human aspect of their actions that makes the story work and without this you'd be left with something not nearly as impressive. I really enjoyed Johnson in the lead role and thought he made a very believable dork as well as a believable action hero. Moretz and her dirty mouth clearly steal the film as she also gets the best costume of all our heroes. Cage doesn't go as over-the-top as you'd expect but it's fun seeing an actor of his type in this kind of movie. I'm sure a long article could be written about an 11-year-old girl who kills without feelings and one whose father taught her to kill but I think that would be missing the point of the film. This wasn't meant to be any psychological drama about kids and violence so if you're unwilling to laugh then it's probably best that you skip this film. For me, the images were rather dark but at the same time they were rather playful, real and most importantly they were funny."
"Combat-Carl","8","3","8","9 August 2010"," A great Suprehero/gangster/teen comedy
","So, superhero films. Loads of them have graced or destroyed our screens. The Dark Knight (graced) Spiderman 3 (destroyed,badly). That proves how difficult it is to make such a film.<br/><br/>Here sits Kick-Ass combining comedy, gangster themes and action. Reminds us of a certain 2004 film by the same director.<br/><br/>Here Dave Lizewski, a stereotypical geek, who is liked by few and disliked by many more, dreams of superheroes. Noticing the bullies, murderers and other bad folk he decides to be a superhero (a thought gone through many young boys and girls). Now Dave has no powers and a very weak physique but still wants to help. His first ""heroic"" deed ends up with him being stabbed and run over by a car. Hmmmmm, admirably he continues with his alter-ego (Kick-Ass).<br/><br/>Enter Hit-Girl and Big Dadddy. A father and his 11 year old daughter who are expert marksmen and mêlée combatants. After running in with Kick-Ass they both join up to fight a crime-lord, Frank D'Amico. Now anything else I say will be a spoiler so I'll end the summary here.<br/><br/>The acting is great. Nicholas Cage is great (I know!) but still doesn't show any other emotion than blank. Hit-Girl (played by fairly unknown Chloe Moretz)is a potty mouthed, violent pre-teen. Chris Mintz-Plasse (Superbad's Mclovin) plays the baddie for this and, presumably, the next.<br/><br/>Whilst the film is exciting, violent, sweary and well made. The thing that really impressed me was the fact that Matthew Vaughn made it follow the same style (kinda) to his major release, L4yer Cake. So,in short watch Kick-Ass because, strangely, it isn't a cheap, crappy money maker. It is also a very adult film with bloody violence, an infamous uttering of the c-word so don't think it's Spiderman"

","A truly daring comic-book movie, with great action sequences and dialogue that's sure to shock and leave you in awe. It's customary to hear profanities from adults in films, but hearing it from children always throws you for a loop. Nothing wrong with it in my view, and the constant use of it by Hit-Girl was a funny story in itself. She and Big Daddy definitely made for a great team, and provided some of the film's best moments. No doubt she's the star of the film, as her scenes are pretty much brilliant. Not familiar with the comic book, but as a stand-alone film, it's great. So, as far as an adaptation goes, I'm pretty sure it lives up to the source material."

"benhall_uk","8","3","8","1 July 2010"," Kicking ass and taking names
","A FEW years ago all we had to satisfy our titular comic book fantasies on the big screen was a baby-faced Toby Maguire prancing around in a red spandex suit. Now it would seem we are spoilt for choice as the age of the comic book sets into full, unflinching flow. The latest panel to film conversion is indie flick Kick Ass. This however, is a different coloured set of spandex altogether. Rated with a 15 certificate, it's not one of the family friendly comic tales of which the world has become accustomed to of late. Instead, it is a rough and tumble, action packed adventure with copious helpings of in-your-face violence and colourful profanities from unexpected mouths. Regular American high school student and comic book fan Dave Lizewski lives a simple life alone with his father. Personal trials, hardships and popularity aren't problems which really factor into Dave's life, until one day he decides to become a super hero - without powers or training. This simple concept opens up a realm of possibilities which resonate on a more personal level with an audience who live in the same universe, as opposed to the eccentricities of the Marvel and DC worlds portrayed in previous comic book adaptations. Because of this, the hilarity of the situations Kick-Ass finds himself in are amplified tenfold; giving the audience a more realistic, often painful, representation of what being a real-life super hero would be like. It would seem Dave is not alone in his quest either. He soon runs into crime-fighting duo Big Daddy and Hit Girl, a father-daughter combo of devastating proportions. Veteran Nicholas Cage gives a suitably high quality performance as the doting Dad tutoring his lethal little girl, but the plaudits from most critics have gone to 13-year-old Chloe Moretz, who was only 12 at the time of filming. Her role and performance will inevitably be redolent of previous young starlets like Jodie Foster in Taxi Driver and Natalie Portman in Leon. All of Moretz's co-stars and crew have heaped praise on the youngster, with many confessing to being forced into raising their game at the risk of being acted off screen by the pocket-sized puncher. Samurai swords and ninja throwing stars are Hit Girl's weapons of choice, and she is a dab hand at using them. Slicing and dicing her way through hoards of bad guys, Big Daddy's daughter carries out her job with an unflinching, hard-as-nails attitude. However, the small hero is also where the film draws the bulk of its controversy. One scene in particular sees Hit Girl beckoning more baddies on by calling them a four letter profanity currently considered one of the language's worst. Those who stir the controversy though are, for the most part,those who have not seen the film but only heard about this on-paper noteworthy situation. Those who then see Kick-Ass though, will probably employ hindsight as they realise the subtle yet evident portent of emotional hardship Hit Girl has had to endure as she grew up with her father in prison. As such, the language she uses is not for the shock effect on its audience, but more a faithful reprise of the comic book character's melancholic upbringing. Moving away from the controversy, a potential sidekick of questionable morals in the form of Superbad's Christopher Mintz-Plasse arrives to help Kick-Ass in his quest. Red Mist is the on screen son of super (yet still normal) villain Frank D'Amico, played by the ever despicable Mark Strong. The rich kid son, desperate to please his father, goes undercover to infiltrate Kick-Ass' superhero circle and provides some classic hilarity as he finds out that being a scrawny comic book nerd is not the best qualification for becoming a superhero. The film's grounded reality is its most empirical feature. At first glance, Kick-Ass' costume looks like a wet-suit you could pick up on ebay with a few extra pads stuck on. At second glance it turns out that that's exactly what it is. His first attempt at super heroism consequently ends up getting him hospitalised and throughout the film he keeps his homely characteristics that make him a normal teenage boy, all the while developing the courage and bravery of a true superhero. Grittily realistic is an adjective too far though. The film strikes a perfect balance between apathetic realism and over-the-top, completely un-PC action. Seeing Big Daddy teach Hit Girl how to 'take a bullet' by shooting her with a machine gun while she has a bullet-proof vest on is something that, for all the world an audience feels it should be shocked and appalled at, but the conviction and temerity of the characters make it utterly hilarious. The story plays on an interesting concept which the majority of its audience will find easy to relate to: The overwhelming desire to become a super hero in real life. The fact that the movie was commissioned before the third edition of the comic was even published and its first story arc completed speaks volume's about Kick Ass' potential as a low budget blockbuster destined for infinite critical acclaim. Perhaps the film is not one for the more conservative viewers who like their super heroes well-spoken and family-friendly (Aside from French audiences, who can see the same Kick-Ass at their local cinemas with a PG certificate), but it remains an absolute must for anyone outside of that classification. Spider Man and Batman are everything a super hero movie should be, and this movie is absolutely nothing like them, which is its crowning achievement. In Kick-Ass, writer Mark Millar has managed to create a viable alternative to the super hero norm which matches the quality of those clad in tight costumes who have come before it in a completely different, radical way. Just don't go getting any ideas..."
"KineticSeoul","8","5","17","16 April 2010"," As corny as it may seem, this movie really does kick ass.
","Not only is this movie ballsy, it really did beat my expectations. It's rare when a movie is way better than the trailer and this movie is just one of them. Sure there are a few flaws in other people's opinion, on how this isn't a plausible superhero movie, and more of a wannabe superhero's fantasy. And how the main protagonist Kick-Ass is overshadowed by other characters, mainly Hit-Girl who is so entertaining to watch on screen. Not only is this one of the best wannabe superhero movie out there, it also beats out a lot of superhero movies. It's been a while since I had some much fun in the theaters, I was thoroughly entertained. This really isn't a superhero movie for kids, but screw that. I don't really care cause this movie was ballsy and yet very entertaining to watch, plus there is plenty of good movies for kids out already. Also this movie probably isn't going to be the funniest movie of the year, but those holy crap moments are just so very cool, you can't help but laugh. It really did beat my expectation on every level and I can't wait to watch it again. I am glad the distributors decided not to dumb this movie down for the younger audiences, the director Matthew Vaughn has made some good movies in the past and I sure hope he keeps doing so. The soundtrack was rocking as well and it fit the scenes it needed to fit in. Nicolas Cage did a great job with his role as well, it's been a while since he was featured in a great movie that deserves to be seen in theaters and glad he ain't going to waste, he was entertaining to watch as well.<br/><br/>8.8/10"
"craigjohnson20","Null","5","17","15 April 2010"," ""Kick-Ass"" is THE Superhero movie of the year!!!
","Next month the first movie of the summer ""Iron Man 2"" arrives. But, if I may be so bold, the most awesome, thrilling, greatest super-hero movie of the year is in theaters right now! Sure, ""Iron Man 2"" will have more CG, bigger explosions and a 200 Million dollar budget; and you might even leave the theater with a smile on your face. But if Christopher Nolan's 'Batman' movies have taught us anything, it takes more than that to make a really awesome superhero movie. And ""Kick-Ass"" is a really awesome super-hero movie! The movie begins by introducing us to the central character, Dave Lizewski, played by Aaron Johnson: a slightly nerdy and extremely average high-school student. He likes comic-books; wishes girls would notice he exists; and, most of all, he is sick and tired of being mugged every other day and watching criminals run around doing whatever they want. He wishes crime-fighting super-heroes existed in the real world; and, hey, why not him? So, he orders a wetsuit off of E-Bay as a costume and goes out into the streets to fight crime as Kick-Ass. The problem is, he has no fighting skills, his only weaponry is a pair on numchucks and a taser-gun, and his physique is greatly inferior to literally every criminal he comes across. The only thing he has going in his favor is a higher tolerance for pain than the average citizen: he is the super-hero equivalent of that episode of ""The Simpsons"" where Homer becomes a successful boxer simply because he is able to get punched in the face a lot without it bothering him.<br/><br/>Yet in spite of how bad he is at being a super-hero, he manages to become a media sensation when footage of him fighting bad-guys gets posted on Youtube. And this coincides with the arrival of two new masked crime-fighters, not nearly as famous as Kick-Ass, but infinitely better crime-fighters: Big Daddy and his 11 year old daughter, Hit-Girl.<br/><br/>These two characters are the heart and soul of this movie. If this movie is Uma Thurman's heart in ""Pulp Fiction"", Big Daddy and Hit-Girl are the syringe full of adrenaline going into it.<br/><br/>Big Daddy, played ideally by Nicholas Cage, spends his day as nebbish cartoonist Damon Macready; but at night, with far from subtle overtones to Bruce Wayne, he dons a Batman-like suit and uses the millions of dollars he has acquired from taking down organized crime to buy a spectacular array of military weaponry. His primary target, local crime lord, Frank D'amico.<br/><br/>His protégé daughter, Hit-Girl, played by Chloe Moretz, has been trained since she was five to fight crime giving her the ability to run on walls, back flip through the air; and shoot guns like Chow-Yun Fat in a John Woo movie. She also a particular fondness for killing bad guys with butterfly knives.<br/><br/>I won't say anymore about the plot of this movie because this is one of those rare instances where the trailer doesn't give too much away; and I'll be damned if I'm gonna ruin that. Suffice to say, that when this movie kicks into high-gear, you're gonna love it.<br/><br/>My advice, see this movie soon and try to go when the theater is packed. Because this is not a movie that you simply watch. This is a movie that you laugh with, then clap at the screen; and then by the finale, you are simply yelling things like ""Fuck, Yeah!"" every few seconds and cheering until after the credits have started rolling.<br/><br/>Plus, it ends with a very sweet set-up for a sequel. So, see this now. Because, if ""Iron Man 2"" is not gonna bring anything new to the table, I want my sequel to ""Kick-Ass""!"
"jdesando","Null","5","17","11 April 2010"," It kicks comic-book butt.
","""Tool up, honey bunny. It's time to get bad guys."" Damon Macready<br/><br/>Kick Ass kicks the hell out of the serious comic-book hero films like Spiderman because it makes fun of the genre while it has fun indulging in the excesses of both comics and their film adaptations. Dave Lizewski/KickAss (Aaron Johnson) represents every healthy male who has ever dreamed of being a super-hero (and I'm one of that legion). Dave actually makes a costume and goes out to do good, failing at each encounter with evil because, well, he's never been trained in super-hero actions, and he's a klutz. <br/><br/>The real thing is played with gusto and uncharacteristic sweetness by Nicholas Cage as Damon Macready/Big Daddy, but the heroine, Mindy Macready/Hit Girl, is played with gusto and tongue firmly in her 12-year old cheek by Chloe Moretz, who dons a hero costume and literally kicks ass. Moretz is memorable as the young sage, Rachel, in 500 Days of Summer, and Cage, well, he hasn't been this good since Leaving Las Vegas.<br/><br/>While it's not always easy to tell at any one moment whether Kick-Ass is a full-blown Batman satire or a teen comedy about dorks redux, it is enjoyable for its lighthearted depiction of sanitized violence, corny adolescent romance, and eccentric dad/daughter dealings.<br/><br/>Besides the fine lead performances and impeccable pacing by director Matthew Vaughan, the cinematography, a rich color blend and crispness, delivers the visual fun of comics with the high-key clarity of a teen musical. While Kick-Ass is far away from the fan boy fantasy of Sin City, arguably the best comic book adaptation in the last decade, don't let the bullets and badinage keep our teens from enjoying a bit of pop-cult satire as easy to digest as White Castles on late date night—it's sinfully good."
"Jules45","10","5","17","31 March 2010"," Kick Ass does exactly what it says on the label. Oh yeah.
","Now being a fan of Matthew Vaughn's last two films, Kick-Ass clearly seemed like his most controversial outing to date, without even comparing it to his other work. Both Layer Cake and Stardust both though enjoyable and well received felt like discrete nods to the distributors that this man can do a fine job of directing no matter what the genre and that he deserves the room for development, since showing he is capable of great potential.<br/><br/>Then came along Kick-Ass, which easily is one of this years must see's, simply because it is nothing and everything like you expect. Example: Expect the costumes to look out of place, expect the C-word bomb from an 11 year old girl and expect a finale that almost makes the end of Kill Bill Volume 1 look like a fairytale. However what wasn't expected was the hilarious conversations between Big Daddy (Nic Cage as a Earless Batman) and his daughter Hit Girl (The awe inspiring Chloe Moretz) and the vast amount of violence, dark humour and the way it walks all over society like another blood splattered corpse of satisfaction.<br/><br/>Dave Livewski (Aaron Johnson) struggles to understand why there is no active costumed vigilante's around in New York to stop crime, and through his comic inspired heroism decides to become Kick-Ass (The hero this time, not the film title). So with his cheesy green wetsuit, determination and lack of social life, Dave's roller-coaster begins. His near fatal experience's doesn't hinder his growing reputation or superhero buddies including Red Mist (Superbad's Christopher Mintz-Plasse) and the infamous father-daughter duo to bringing blood-blitzed peace to a crime-ridden city.<br/><br/>Kick-Ass is a guilty pleasure that people shouldn't be ashamed to enjoy on the basis of the blaspheming and gore infested mass killings. There is a huge amount of likability for the leads who have all done justice to make the most of their characters capabilities; Chloe Moretz deserves particular credit to her notorious role by putting the 'Gonna blow your brains out' in well, just that. Matthew Vaughn has clearly established himself as a man of many talents and after this it's not hard to see why, there is certainly room for a sequel on the horizon, that's for sure."

I personally disliked the movie, so this review will focus on why.<br/><br/>The plot is fun and promising, and the film contains several nice action shots. Apart from some lame adolescent fake and gay jokes, it's fun to watch, but...<br/><br/>My main problem, as I also had when watching ""Watchmen"" for instance, was the extreme and sometimes gratuitous violence using slow-mo and fun music, as if what we were seeing on the screen were no big deal. This movie goes as far as to use a 12 year-old girl chopping up guys with a sword and using foul language all the way through (""cunt"", ""fuck you"", etc.), with manga-like music in the background. This all feels like the millionth remake of Kill Bill, which I also disliked by the way, for the same reason : how can killing people be described and pictured as an art form ? It just shows how comfortable people have become with watching horrific stuff and not be bothered by it at all. Well, this kind of movie bothers me!"
"Smells_Like_Cheese","7","4","13","1 May 2010"," Very awesome, but not for the faint of heart
","I can't tell you how excited I was to see Kick Ass, from the minute I saw the trailer I just couldn't stop laughing. I didn't even know it was a real comic series, I just thought it was a good idea for a satire. How many comic book nerds exist and why haven't they thought about being an actual superhero? That's the basis for Kick Ass. I've been reading a lot of different reviews on this movie and it seems that the main focus that every critic was freaked out about is the extreme violence and foul language, especially coming from an 11 year old girl. I'm warning you in advance, this is a pretty graphic film, but I loved the character Hit Girl. It was a breathe of fresh air that little kids are not always portrayed as little sweeties in film, but I saw this as a fantasy and enjoyed seeing a little girl so charismatic on screen and giving the audience such energy and excitement for the story. I loved all the characters surrounding the story, they seemed to wash out Kick Ass Now there are certainly flaws that come with this film which I will explain in a minute.<br/><br/>Dave Lizewski is an average teenager who wonders why nobody in real life has ever decided to become a superhero like the ones in the comic books, so he decides to become a real-life superhero himself, despite having no superpowers or training of any kind. After his first attempt to fight crime Dave is beaten, stabbed, and hit by a car. Undeterred by his earlier setback, and discovering that he has a new found high-tolerance for pain due to his accident, Dave uses two modified night sticks to defend a man from three attackers. A bystander records the event, as well as Dave calling himself ""Kick-Ass"". The video becomes a YouTube phenomenon, and Dave sets up a MySpace account so people can contact Kick-Ass. During a later mission where he is about to fail again, he is rescued by child costumed vigilante Hit-Girl, who kills his attackers and then leaves with her father, Big Daddy. Together they try to join forces and defeat an evil mobster that Big Daddy has some personal issues with.<br/><br/>So there are flaws with the film, one thing I didn't like was how the film kind of steered another direction, it started out as ""What if someone decided to be a superhero?"" to becoming a clichéd comic book story again. Nerd gets the girl once again, good always triumphing over evil, unbelievable moves coming from the average human being, not to mention how they would be dead or massively injured yet can still move somehow. I would have loved if this had continued into seeing Kick Ass just trying to be a superhero. But speaking of which, I hated the actor that they picked, Aaron Johnson. He was just so dull and I couldn't wait to see someone beat the crap out of him. Nothing about him stood out and he couldn't lift an eyelash to Christopher Mintz-Plasse or Chloë Moretz, they completely stole the movie with their great energy. Even Nicolas Cage, the one actor in the world who ALWAYS puts me to sleep, he was actually good in this movie! I couldn't believe it, it was like he took a caffeine pill and read the script. Christopher Mintz-Plasse has come so far since Superbad, I love this kid and can't wait to see him in future projects, he has great potential. I nearly died laughing at the scene with him and Kick Ass in the car blasting the song Crazy and they started doing their own little dance. Kick Ass is a very fun movie if you are looking for a fun adventure fantasy gore fest, I highly recommend it. I do agree with the critics on one thing, if you're very sensitive to a child behaving in a how do I put this delicately? A raging psychopath then definitely skip it, but personally I had a blast even with a dull lead. All the other characters made it worth the watch. <br/><br/>7/10"
"SaulLidiev","8","4","13","17 April 2010"," Kickass, you mean Asskick
","I have never thought a movie like this would so bad ass. I must admit, I was never really anything in high school of course I knew how to draw, but that really can't count in anything in the popularity status for me. Adding to that I read comics whenever I could, especially those batman comics. <br/><br/>So when I heard this movie last year I was curious what a movie like this would be. Obviously I knew a movie like this would based on a graphic novel. Didn't expect that it was written by the author of The Ultimates, Mark Millar. All I am going to say about the graphic novel, that was hell of bloody. Sure the movie didn't follow exactly like the movie but it had its true essence, it was bloody.<br/><br/>Hit-girl is compared to Punisher in the essence of how far they will go, sure she was eleven years old, and her dad is called Big Daddy ironically, recruited her for his mission to gain vengeance on the drug lord Frank A'mica. Kickass, truthfully is a lame superhero, especially without having superpowers. If I was going to be a superhero I would not just get a suit and then expect to kick butt which Dave Lizewski did. He should have thought well what he was going to do, but the thrill of dressing up in tights has a certain aroma that can not be denied. <br/><br/>To sum it up I liked it the movie and I'll give a two thumbs up if you want something that has a good soundtrack and explosions to satisfied your eyes"

She enjoyed the following parts: when Hitgirl is going through the hallway killing every one and then threw her cartridges away and threw new ones and put into her gun to continue killing people.<br/><br/>when Hitgirl was trapped and kick ass came in the jet pack with the Chain gun and save her.(this was the first time every seeing a chain gun).<br/><br/>the next scene was when the boss was kicking Hitgirl ass and again Kick ass comes and saves the day by firing the bazooka and killing the bad guy.<br/><br/>Now my favorites were when kick ass got stab and was trying to walk away and got hit by the car and then the car sped away.<br/><br/>another was when Kick ass meets Big Daddy and Hitgirl. and she tells him to contact the mayor's office where they have a signal in the shape of a Penis.<br/><br/>I think Hitgirl was the real star of the show and I for one want to see more Hitgirl stuff(cartoon, series, comics)"

","""Remember how, back in 1990, if you used a cellphone in public you looked like a total a**hole? We're all a**holes now."" – Douglas Coupland<br/><br/>Asses get their asses kicked by asses in ""Kick-Ass"", a film by director Matthew Vaughn. An attempt to take your routine super hero origins formula and push it into hipper, more ""offensive"" territory, the film is nevertheless wholly tame, trying so hard to be shocking and transgressive that it's almost cute and docile. Like a puppy. <br/><br/>Like most postmodern films, ""Kick-Ass"" trades entirely in irony. You don't watch the film, so much as your neurons and synapses light up after spotting incongruities. Isn't it ironic that a 10 year old girl is killing adults? Isn't it ironic that gun savvy kids are in a R rated movie? Cue endorphins. <br/><br/>Most super hero movies are power fantasies. ""Kick-Ass"" is thus appropriately structured as both the masturbatory fantasies of a dweeby virgin who fondles himself in front of his computer screen, and the dying dreams of a comic book junkie. In other words, the kid's the audience. In this way, like most postmodern, self reflexive films, ""Kick-Ass"" manages to pointlessly mock exactly what it is (think ""Sucker Punch""), exemplifying what Robert Pfaller calls ""interpassivity"", performing our indictments for us whilst allowing us to consume with impunity.<br/><br/>Some have condemned Vaughn's film for sexualising a ten year old girl, but the film's fan-boys brush off such ridiculous notions. She's just an empowered gal. You know? Like Wonder Woman, but without the always displayed boobs. In truth, violence always has a sexual element and vice versa. Today, most interactive gaming terminology – gaming now being the modern equivalent of violent action movies of yesteryear – utilises jargon rife with blatant sexual connotations (teabagging, raped!, owned!, hardcore mode, f****t, etc). Domination, possessiveness, sex, submission, bullets, perforations, superheroes, guns, little girls, Kleenex. They all overlap. Fanboys disagree? They threaten to ***k you up? Offer to prepare the lipstick and lube while they think of a better choice of words.<br/><br/>""Kick-Ass"" is praised for its mental action scenes and total bad-ass badassery. Ironically, most of these action scenes – especially ""Kick-Ass's"" climax – are derived from Luc Besson's ""Leon"", another film about prepubescent hit girls, Lolita complexes and big, gun-toting men. Also an influence is ""Kite"", an X-rated mid 90s film with underage hit-girls who routinely get raped. The film was banned for being child pornography, which led to it being edited and re-released. Today ""Kick-ass"" looks like ""Kite"" with less balls, which is ironic, considering all these films are essentially about the insecurities of castrated little fan-boys.<br/><br/>5/10 – Worth one viewing."
"edson-br","10","3","9","15 February 2011"," Cidade De Deus + Marvel/DC Comics + Guy Ritchie + Of Course, A Bit Of Tarantino.
","1. When I watched Kick-Ass for the first time what came to the mind was what is essential in Cidade De Deus/City Of God: a mix of kids and teens with extreme violence, amorality and dark humor. Hit-Girl is the girlish answer to little psychopath Dadinho (played in the Brazilian movie by Douglas Silva). I don't know if Cidade De Deus actually influenced the director Matthew Vaughn but as the movie was a big success in the UK - it was then considered the movie of the year by the Empire magazine, for example - that is not so unlikely.<br/><br/>2. The parody of Marvel's and DC Comics' characters is obvious and hilarious. Bem, both comic studios cannot complain much on Vaughn - after all the superhero idea was taken from the Greek heroes like Hercules and Perseus.<br/><br/>3. Kick-Ass does reference, of course, to the ultra-violent style of Guy Ritchie and Tarantino's Kill Bill - the animated sequence doesn't deny its source - although Kill Bill has not even 1/3 of the Kick-Ass quality. Frankly I dislike Tarantino's movies, they seem mere pretexts to show pornographic violence. Moreover, taking out the violence, what remains in Tarantino's movie? Practically nothing ...<br/><br/>A pornographic violence which Kick-Ass almost lets itself enticing by. But fortunately the movie is much more than a little girl mutilating the leg of a drug dealer. The movie has a brilliant humor, amazing performances, spectacular edition, a cool soundtrack and a very much original story.<br/><br/>Original? But it's not a spoof of several superhero movies, parodies Kill Bill and looks like Cidade De Deus? That's right: despite the movie to make many references to other movies it is highly original. It may be paradoxical but who watches Kick-Ass has the distinct feeling that just saw something new, totally fresh and inventive by comparison to the weary superhero and teen movies released every year by Hollywood.<br/><br/>The major highlights of the movie, besides the inspired direction of Vaughn are, of course, Aaron Johnson and Chloë Moretz - the two actors burst the screen. At first sight Hit-Girl is the mesmerizing character - mainly because of the shock caused by her very young age (11 years old) - but after you see the movie another times (I've seen 4 times), you appreciate more the work of Johnson , which is outrageously good (and convincing) as the awkward teenager and nerd who, childishly, dreams of being a superhero in the real life - Damon Wayans did something similar in Blankman but without the same result.<br/><br/>The faces that the super expressive Johnson does are priceless. The subtle changes in voice intonation of his character are very skilled. He even uses a tone of voice for Dave and another for alter ego Kick-Ass. He built a perfect teen personality, very different from his real personality, by that we see in the actor's interviews on the internet. Johnson is the soul of the movie.<br/><br/>Hit-Girl/Chloë Moretz is the most striking movie's element, no doubt, but it is also its biggest problem. I'm no moralist but I understand that many people reject the combination of a little kid character + slaughtering. Yes, the violence is most often caricatured and provokes more laughter than disgust. Yet sometimes the director exaggerates and some deaths are sadistic: a) why murdering a simple hooker who are escaping and it is not a threat anymore? b) kill a villain in a junkyard crusher after interrogating him is out of tone, even if being a comedy. c) severing the leg of a drug dealer is gratuitous graphic violence.<br/><br/>In a country like the U.S. where non-criminal young people, apparently normal, awake on a bad day and decide to kill their classmates - wow - involving child with slaughtering is really something hard to swallow. People are afraid that the Hit-Girl figure functions as an appeal for the kids and influence a generation of little psychos... Bem, I don't think the concern of these people is unjustifiable. Kick-Ass seems to be a movie for teens but it is a movie for adults. Not only because the inappropriate content for minors but also because generally only adults can appreciate all of its humor and quality.<br/><br/>Apart its little sins Kick-Ass is not only the best movie of 2010 as the best movie in years. Really amazing. It's everything the movies of Spider-Man, Batman, Iron Man, etc, should be but never succeeded. Even Hit-Girl's fighting scenes are graphically more ingenious than those of Marvel/DC Comics' superheroes ones - what a shame, Spider-Man!<br/><br/>Surely we all will watch Kick Ass 2: Balls To The Wall but it will be hard Matthew Vaughn and his little gang to make another story so original, creative and irresistible as the first Kick-Ass. Let's hope Matthew will show I'm wrong."
"Tweekums","10","3","9","4 September 2010"," Chloë Moretz steals the show!
","When I saw the trailers for this I thought it looked pretty cool but everybody knows trailers just show the best bits so I wasn't sure if the film would live up to them... it did and then some! I was laughing within the first minute, the laughs continued throughout the film although they were mainly in the first half. The laughs might have slowed down towards the end but the action was turned up to eleven and unlike a lot of action movies there was a feeling that the heroes were in real danger and could get hurt.<br/><br/>Dave is just an ordinary high school kid who dreams of becoming a super hero. Unlike most he decides to make his dreams a reality and buys a super hero costume. He isn't deluded enough to think he has any powers and his first confrontation with a couple of bad guys leaves him in hospital with a knife would and multiple injuries from being run over. When he recovers he doesn't give up and his next confrontation goes somewhat better. This was caught on camera and 'Kick-Ass' becomes an internet sensation. It also gets him another job; the girl he loves but thinks he is gay asks him to deliver a message to a guy who has been hassling her. When he agrees he doesn't know the guy is a drug dealer. Just as it looks as if his superhero days are going to come to a grisly end the dealer and his gang are cut down by Hit-Girl, a purple-wigged eleven year old with a penchant for ultra-violence! It turns out that the dealer worked for crime lord Frank D'Amico and before getting killed took a picture of Kick-Ass; now D'Amico wants Kick-Ass dead! In order to lure him out D'Amico's son becomes 'Red Mist' and takes Kick-Ass to a warehouse to be dealt with, when he gets there it is on fire and everybody is dead so he must use Kick-Ass to find out who is really destroying his operation and then deal with them. The real threat is from Hit-Girl and her father Big Daddy.<br/><br/>I can't remember when I had so much fun watching a film; Aaron Johnson is great as Kick-Ass as are Nicolas Cage and Mark Strong as Big Daddy and Frank D'Amico but the real star is young Chloë Moretz who plays Hit-Girl, she steals every scene she is in and manages to make the viewer believe that an eleven year old girl could take out a room full of gangsters with ease. The action scenes, especially those with Hit-Girl and Big Daddy among the most entertaining that I've seen as gangsters are dispatched with a variety of weapons. Just because this film features an eleven year old superhero does not mean it is suitable for children of that age; there is plenty of bloody violence including some where young Hit-Girl takes a severe beating, quite a bit of swearing and one admittedly tame sex scene. If those things don't put you off though I strongly recommend giving the film a go."
"Floated2","10","3","9","2 July 2010"," Surprisingly a really great movie
","I got the chance to see this movie last night (07/01/10') on DVD and it was great. I heard many great reviews and some mixed reviews but its a great movie. People need to stop talking movies too seriously and enjoy it for what it is. Granted, its not a movie for everyone, and not everyone would like it but people need to give it a try and quit at it if they dislike it.<br/><br/>It's rare when a movie is seemed better than the trailer and this movie is just one of them. Sure there are a few flaws in other people's opinion, on how this isn't a plausible superhero movie, and more of a wannabe superhero's fantasy. And how the main protagonist Kick-Ass is overshadowed by other characters, mainly Hit-Girl who is so entertaining to watch on screen. Not only is this one of the best wannabe superhero movie out there, it also beats out a lot of superhero movies. This movie was ballsy and yet very entertaining to watch because unlike PG-13 movies, this movie goes all out. They don't hold back on the action and violence, and that is one of the reasons why this movie was successful. I am glad the distributors decided not to dumb this movie down for the younger audiences. Nicolas Cage did a great job with his role as well but unlucky for him, he character dies towards the end. His daughter, Hit-Girl really stole the show in this movie and she was definitely the main character towards the end of the movie. It was intense and amazing!"
"sandeepamar","7","3","9","16 May 2010"," Good Watch for its a Fantasy Movie
","OK, it is not an 8.3, and could be at best a 4, but I have given it a 7, and have my reasons. It is like when movies business started, people went to ""talkies"" to see some entertainment, something unreal with which they can relate their fantasies and dreams. I generally watch serious movies with characters, story and the way the movie builds, and the message. It is like in a discussion between Scorsese and Spielberg, Scorsese said, I try to start from the very atom and then keep pulling my camera up to 30,000 feet to get a broader picture, the micro to the macro and vice versa. <br/><br/>This is not that kind of movie, this is a movie for fun, fantasy and a laugh, if you can. It doesn't develop, its storyline is weak, and has no continuity, but its fun, and at some level captures modern world with internet, people not helping each other, rather filming them and so on. <br/><br/>Our Superhero Kick-ass is a lovable character, and he gets lost all the time, and tries to get simple things in life, for example once he finds love in life, he forgets about the Superhero dreams. The movie has its moments, and becomes like the spy kids thing with the 11 year old hitting out all the bad guys. <br/><br/>But here is my problem beyond just enjoying the movie, it can be a bad influence, especially the scene wherein Nick Cage tries out bullets on his 11 year old, and some of the gun fight scenes.<br/><br/>Overall, if you can take a movie as a fantasy, you can give it a shot, fun at best, good 2 hrs spend, but it is no ""watchmen"", which is my favorite superhero movie."

","Dave Lizewski is an unnoticed high school student and comic book fan who one day decides to become a super-hero, even though he has no powers, training or meaningful reason to do so.<br/><br/>Superhero movies have lost originality, have loads of cliché, and every bit of it has become bland. In 2010, however, Kick-Ass has introduced us to a new breed of superheros and has designed it's own genre. A mixture of ultra-violence, comedy, and pure awesomeness. The trailer is a bit sketchy and made me have no intention of seeing the film in the first place. This changing when I saw the reviews. Kick-Ass, for one, is hilarious! I expected humor, but the humor is great and somewhat infused with dark comedy. The acting (surprisingly) was great and even Nicholas Cage did an good job. Then the plot (sounding extremely cliché) introduces new ideas and just pure fun. The ultra-violence was a change too and made this film even more unique. The rising director has lots in store for him and hearing of the sequel, I have high hopes. Kick-Ass is definitely a highlight of 2010 and will draw you in to a pop-cultured world, as of ours today, and will definitely want you to re-watch with friends. 9/10."
"cameronmarcusk","Null","2","5","22 September 2011"," A film that's all you could ever ask for.
","Simply said, such a great film. I won't give too much away but in essence, this film is about a young high school student who loves comic books and wonders the world has so much evil, yet people stand and do nothing. It's not so much the plot of this movie that is so intriguing but the way in which it is handled. Every aspect of this movie is taken realistically, in a way that leaves the audience with no questions of disbelief. The cast in this is incredible. Definitely a breakthrough performance from Aaron Johnson, and Chloe Moretz is hilarious. The biggest on-screen persona comes from none other than Nic Cage as Big Daddy. The patriarchal-revenge-crazy Cage is astounding to watch and the action throughout is immensely thrilling. While few other movies are as compelling, Cage's next best ""Trespass"" looks like a winner. Do yourself a favor and check out the trailer. http://on.fb.me/pchomT"
"benbaecher","9","2","5","17 January 2011"," Kicked Ass!
","Had to bring my younger brother to a movie and my folks thought Kick Ass was safe because of the trailer they saw. In the trailer it looks like it's going to be a kids to teen to family movie, I didn't want to go, but it was forced on me. I was very happy I went. Couldn't believe how crude the movie was, it was great! The little 13 year old shocked the hell out of me. Couldn't believe her language. Funny S*%t. Some of the movie was borderline brutal, definitely not a family movie. Found it more culty. Not gonna ruin for anybody by giving details but the movie was a serious, gritty, action packed film, with characters that at first glance you wouldn't expect to be serious, gritty, and actiony (know it's not a word but you guys get it). And thought Cage was great, he had this ol' school Adam West thing going on (my pop's an avid batman and star trek ol' school fool so I've had it around me for quite some time). But when Cage broke into that mode, I just lost it, and so did my kid brother from the stuff our pop watches. The trailer I saw told a different story, not sure why, maybe for shock factor. The movie definitely rocked."
"garyvanhorn","8","2","5","10 January 2011"," Well executed and entertaining.
","I have to say that Kick-Ass pretty much kicked ass. The previews for the movie are very misleading, it's not a spoof movie at all but rather it is a movie about would-be superheroes in the real world, sort of. Dave is a nerdy high school student that is perpetually being mugged outside the comic shop he frequents. Lamenting the fact that people often witness crimes and do nothing he decides to do what nobody has done before, become a superhero. Kick-Ass has no powers, no training, no gimmicks or gadgets, just a great deal of idealism and naivety, and that's all he needs.<br/><br/>At first he is wildly unsuccessful, landing himself in the intensive care unit after attempting to stop a car theft. Eventually he manages to do some good and the video taken by onlookers becomes an internet sensation. This inspires Damon (Nicholas Cage) and his eleven year old daughter, Mindy, whom Damon has been training since she was five to be a combat expert, to join the fight against evil. Damon becomes Big Daddy, a cross between Batman and The Punisher, and Mindy becomes Hit Girl. The action sequences with Hit Girl are straight out of The Matrix. It is very surreal to watch an eleven year old dispatch bad guys with guns, knives, swords, and skilled martial arts, but it is very entertaining.<br/><br/>The operations of the new superheroes put them into direct conflict with the local drug kingpin, Frank D'Amico. A series of traps, shootouts, deceptions, and brawls leads to the final climax of heroes vs. villains inside the skyscraper headquarters of the drug kingpin. Is the movie a satire? Perhaps, but I sense more that it is a reflection of the writer's wish that there really were superheroes. If you are offended by the idea of a little girl kicking ass and taking names I suggest you not see this film. However, if you like to be entertained I do recommend Kick-Ass."
"Jona1988","9","2","5","21 October 2010"," Awesome! This movie kicks ***!
","Kick-Ass is a superhero movie that uses a mix of high school comedy, teenage romance, extreme violence and most of all satire. It works absolutely perfect. All aspects are here, cool action, interesting characters, great humor and also a clever plot line. Feels like a really original superhero film and I will go so far as claim it is one of the best I have seen. It's simply brilliant. So the film is really violent perhaps one of the bloodiest superhero films ever. But it's not just for the sake of it. The action scenes feel in a way like they are both gritty and suspenseful but also totally over the top at the same time and of course so entertaining. The humor is great, some jokes are funny just on their own and others are parody of other recent superhero films. I guess in many ways this is a film for the geeks but also viewers that are not totally into the superhero genre will find a great time here. This movie is itself a superhero adventure but at the same time satire, a play on the superhero genre, comic books and popular culture. But the whole plot is great written and actually deeper and cleverer than most in the genre. It's much more than just a parody. The whole adventure is great but just as much interesting are the characters. The character's ordinary life is just as engrossing. The acting is superb. Chloë Grace Moretz is the standout both in her performance but she hers is also the most interesting character. But Aaron Johnson fits his character just as perfectly. I like most I think have not been a fan of Nicolas Cage in a long time but this was his best performance in years. This is one of the best films of 2010. I don't read much comics anymore and I didn't know anything about it so Kick-ass was one of the year's positive surprises. The most original superhero film in years and also one of the best. Kick-ass is amazing!"

Kick-Ass is the adaptation of the comic book of the same name created by Mark Millar. It is original, entertaining, full of action, adventure and a very good and dark humor.

","Kick-Ass is one of those movies that really stands out. It's a superhero movie, mixed in with an over-the-top movie, mixed in with a bunch of clichés. Its plot made me interested in the whole thing, for the most part. It was over-the-top like I said, but the action was still really good. I could have done without the maiming and blood gushes but it was still good nonetheless. Another thing I disliked was the fact that everybody in the movie had some family issues. EVERYBODY had one or more family member die. It was ridiculous. It tried to make us care about their relationships when really it was overwhelming. The humor was meh and unimpressive. I chuckled a couple times but that was it. Also, too much comic relief. It may sound like I'm nitpicking or I hated this movie, but I didn't These are just minor complaints. The plot was very interesting and moved along at a good pace, the action was pretty well done, the characters were fun, and it was just a fun experience. 8/10"

I noticed many of the negative reviewers gave it a bad rating due to the violence. I'm a sunshine and rainbows type girl but the violence didn't bother me a bit. No movie should get a bad rating just based on that. The reason I gave it one star is because the story was unoriginal and boring. The main guy, ""Kick Ass,"" does nothing beyond helping a guy that was getting beat up by a gang. That's it. Late in the movie he tells his girlfriend that he has to ""go do some Kick-Ass stuff."" I was left thinking, ""and just what exactly would that be?"" He's only in a couple fights and gets the crap beat out of him. How does that make him a ""Kick ass"" super-hero? What was also annoying was how the movie kept zooming in on his face as he pondered deeply about who knows what. The character everyone seems to like is a little girl that's more brave and fights much better than our nerdy superhero. Oh yeah, she also swears and for some reason people seem to think that's awesome. At no point in the movie did I actually believe an 11 year old would talk or act like she did. The only group of people who would be amused by this are teenage boys, who shouldn't be seeing the movie anyway since it's rated R. I expected this movie to be good. Don't waste your time on it."
"doctorsmoothlove","3","4","14","19 June 2010"," Dirty Young Men
","Life becomes comedy in Kick-Ass. This is a film about a geeky high school boy who decides to become a self-made superhero called Kick Ass. He is portrayed by Aaron Johnson, real-life teenager, who is married to a woman more than twenty years older than he. Kick Ass becomes the sidekick of ruthless super vigilantes Hit Girl and her father Big Daddy. Hit Girl is about eleven years old and dismembers her enemies as graphically as possible and verbally abuses people before she kills them. She is portrayed by thirteen-year old Chloe Morentz who cannot even utter the film's proper title without being grounded. <br/><br/>The situation of its actors gives the film the weird status of being a mainstream exploitation film, while simultaneously pandering to its audience's sexism and insensitivity. Much of what is supposed to be funny is either a (self) degrading joke at the expense of Kick Ass or another male character, or watching Hit Girl engage in adult criminal activity. Hit Girl kills as many people as her father, but it's funny because she's a little girl, and he is an adult man. Big Daddy's kills are perfunctory. This is mistaken by some people to be some strange type of female empowerment, and that's sad. There exists, I think, the possibility of a good female superhero film, where the protagonist has to deal with a type of emotional problem of some kind. Can we ever get a good movie about women working in the heroing business? You can include a competent girl hero only if she's clearly there for laughs or sex appeal. Making her eleven years old adds to the joke because children aren't supposed to be criminals. Had Hit Girl been older, I would be far more likely to have not felt guilty by laughing at her antics. Making her older, like some major studios suggested, would be less perverse. There is a scene near the end of the movie where Kick Ass fires a bazooka at someone from teen feet away. The guy flies through the window into the next building. It's OK to laugh at adults killing other adults. <br/><br/>The better humor comes from the relentless barraging of Kick Ass and his friends. These jokes are at least set up in context of situations that happen in the movie. Teenage guys are stabbed, run over by cars, castigated by their mob lord dads, or forced to watch box sets of Ugly Betty. All of these are attempts at satire of Millennium Generation stereotypes, yet they are too narrow. Unless you are part of the fringe audience this film was made for, you won't understand why so much of what you see is funny. You know, there really are high school and college-aged guys who have girlfriends and aren't nerds. The movie exists in an alternative world where being what we consider an ordinary teenager is impossible. <br/><br/>I won't lie; I laughed a lot. This isn't a poorly made film. Kick Ass narrates his life with references to a lot of contemporary male nerd culture. This will be nostalgia for a lot of people, even women. For me, Kick Ass is a reminder of every time I leer at a young girl in momentary lust. I can't help that I find her attractive, but I always feel dirty.<br/><br/>Not recommended."
"paudie","8","4","14","17 May 2010"," Another original from Vaughn
","I was highly impressed by Matthew Vaughn's first effort at directing in ""Layer Cake"", a gritty look at London's gangland. With ""Kick Ass"" he has again produced a highly original take on a popular genre, this time the superhero film.<br/><br/>For the first hour it was hard to tell where the film was going. It starts with a geeky high school student deciding to ""become"" a superhero. He buys a uniform and hits the street, determined to do good. As you might expect this doesn't go as he would have hoped. From there however the film takes off into unexpected and highly entertaining territory, which I won't spoil by describing in too much detail.<br/><br/>Unlike ""Spiderman"" and other movies from that genre the violence depicted is quite graphic and this comes as a shock at first. Trailers I saw gave the impression that the film is a comedy but most of the humour is very black indeed.<br/><br/>Young Aaron Johnson – last seen as John Lennon in Nowhere Boy – is spot on the gormless but well meaning teenager getting a lot more than he bargained for. Nicolas Cage nearly steals the film with his Adam West impression! Chloe Moretz is great as Cage's daughter, definitely not a young girl to judge on first impressions! It was also enjoyable to spot the many UK actors in the supporting cast that Vaughan brought across the Atlantic with him.<br/><br/>So apart from a pretty pointless teen romance side story I really enjoyed this film"

","For more reviews head to http://rantsreviews4filmnuts.blogspot.com/ Superheros, caped crusaders, masked avengers, latex wearing super studs. Why is it that these paragons of righteous humanity only exist in our dreams? The main point of Kick Ass is to show us that superheroes don't exist in our modern world for a very good reason. Kick Ass is a parody of the insanely popular comic book adaptations that have been bombarding our theatres since the release of Spiderman back in 2001. The satirical elements of the film seem to be lost on a large number of critics who have branded the film with all kinds of damaging labels; 'exploitative', 'gratuitously violent', and 'politically incorrect' to name but a few. Of course Kick Ass is all of these things. But the film has a different motive for being so than your normal run of the mill action pick.<br/><br/>Kick Ass tells the story of Dave Lizewski, an avid comic book fan who wonders why no-one has ever thought of becoming a superhero? The constantly unnoticed and downtrodden Dave decides to do what others only dream of and create a crime fighting alter ego Kick Ass. Dave soon realises that being a superhero is harder than he thought, especially after only narrowly escaping with his life on many occasions. Dave's problems escalate when Mafia kingpin Frank D'Amico thinks Kick Ass is behind a slew of recent drug busts that is actually the work of real vigilantes Big Daddy and Hit Girl.<br/><br/>Unlike most comic book adaptations Kick Ass does not glorify violence. The graphic nature of the fight scenes serve to humanize the actions. They do not appear heroic, just a big bloody mess. The film also explores the consequences of violence. Every time our hero engages in a battle he is beaten to a bloody pulp and only narrowly escapes with his life.<br/><br/>Most of the flack received by the film centre's around the character of eleven year old, foul mouthed vigilante Hit Girl. Why exactly is it that this character has received condemnation from family groups worldwide, especially since the MA 15+ film has never been marketed as anything less than strictly adult entertainment? Sure Hit Girl is like a pint sized Rambo, but is she any more disturbing than the mass murdering, psychopathic child in Orphan? The sociopathic, serial killer played by Macaulay Culkin in The Good Soon? A callous, bloodthirsty Kirsten Dunst in Interview with the Vampire? There are countless other examples of child exploitation, but Kick Ass seems to be the film taking the beating. The fact that director Matthew Vaughn is making the point that Hit Girl is a product of our increasingly violent culture seems to be lost on most naysayers. He makes the statement that superhero films glorify violence so much that in our society it is perfectly within the realms of possibility for an eleven year old to wish for guns and knives for her birthday.<br/><br/>Kick Ass is a rollicking good farce and anyone who attempts to view it as a straight up action film is going to have trouble. It successfully pokes fun at many generic superhero conventions; the death of a loved one, the arrival of a superpower (which in Dave's case is a slightly heightened ability to take pain due to nerve damage sustained in a fight), the superhero costume ( a green scuba suit which Dave attempts to wear underneath his clothes at all times), the training regime, the nerd boy who likes popular girl, the showdown and the inevitable sequel setup.<br/><br/>The cast is exceptional. Nicholas Cage gives his best performance in years as Big Daddy, Chloe Moretz almost steals the film as Hit Girl, Christopher Mintz- Plasse brings the laughs as Red Mist and Mark Strong delivers another exceptional villain. The film's star Aaron Johnson continues to show his versatility as an actor, possessing the humility to make Dave pathetic enough that the audience just can't help but root for him.<br/><br/>Kick Ass is a unique film that deserves to find a large audience. Here's hoping that audiences will get past the controversy and be able to view the film for the delightful romp that it is."
"tshaochan","10","4","14","1 May 2010"," Kick Ass Kicked Ass!
","For an action and comedy flick fan, this movie wasn't good; it wasn't great either...it was simply one of the best movies of the year. In a nutshell, the movie was simply like taking the comedic elements of ""Superbad"" the post-modern elements of ""Killbill"" and the narrative flow of ""Spiderman"" and throwing them all in a blender. You have your typical hapless young hero/narrator who was a desperate virgin indulging in his own delusion of grandeur...who through a series of events evolves into someone with a backbone worth of being called ""kick-ass"" the name of his alter-ego. Then you have the standard revenge story of a cop who was framed by the bad guys (well, the antagonist of the film who happens to be the king-pin, top drug lord in the City) and spends the remainder of his life plotting revenge by sweeping the city clean of gangster minion scum from the bottom up. And finally there's the usual element found in teen comedies of nerd-wanting to get laid with hottest chick from school...pretends to be gay friend and later nudging himself out of the ""just-friends"" zone. Har har, very unoriginal over-used concepts. However, what this film does exceptionally well is fusing those three cliché element while throwing in some unexpected twists. <br/><br/>First off, there's the main characters, the narrator of the film Dave, aka Kick-ass, who clearly resembles Toby-Mcguire from Spiderman...the twist here is that he is literally your average teenager that watches kung-fu flix but can never pull off a perfect roundhouse kick - and he actually remains this way through out the film (well, due credit should be given to him since he did get run over by a truck and lost thousands of nerve endings...which gave him a high tolerance to pain). Dave was still the same guy - but with balls the size of grapefruits (not litearlly) which gave him the courage to face real bad guys with guns. <br/><br/>Second twist here is Hit Girl. Man, usually these movies features the badass lone-ranger seeking revenge in the goriest manner possible. Kick Ass adds a little 11 year old swording wielding daughter to the equation. The lone wolf here is played by non-other than Nick Cage...a fitting role giving his recent breakdown...here was a strong man, torn into pieces through forces beyond his control...but still managed to bounce back only to become a shadowly force shaving off bits and bits of his enemies slowly. You thought he lost everything...but the kicker is his dying wife gave him a daughter before her death. And Nick Cage raised that child to be a beast. Hit Girl is so bad ass that she's the only reason why the film was given an R rating. Bursting on the scene by cutting down a man three times her size and age, Hit girl Slices down her enemies with ruthless efficiency while simultaneously sprewing cuss words like a sailor...but curiously enough, sneaks cute curious glances at a defeated Kick-ass after each kill. I can't find a more interesting juxtaposition than an adorable girl that can deal some massive carnage. She stole the show. <br/><br/>Another interesting scene is when Kickass, aka Dave sneaks into the bedroom of the girl of his dreams, unmasks himself and gets pepper sprayed...but to great avail for his sex life...despite having no game.<br/><br/>Well of course, throw in MCLOVING from Superbad and you instantly get a love-able character that you can't exactly take too seriously. That's what makes Mcloving so damn suitable as the son of Mark Strong's character, the kingping. I can help but be drawn by the chemistry of McLoving and Mark Strong's character...whose dialogue and interactions at times provides comic relief...which is a refreshing change considering the typical offering of action flicks out there where the bad guys are portrayed in such stiff and ostentatious manner. Also, the foreshadowing elements are so obvious, but so cleaverly placed...and it was damn satisfying when kick ass blew mark strong away, literally....only to take off rocket-man style later. This film is just a goldmine of great sequences, most of them unexpected twists from familiar elements....and that's what makes it KICKASS!!!"
"clyde-danielson","10","4","14","30 April 2010"," ""Kick-Ass"" blew me away!
","""Kick-Ass"" blew me away! Right from the moment I saw the trailer I knew that I wanted to see this movie. It is easily the best movie I have seen this year! Not being a big comic book reader for years now, I didn't need to compare the story to the anything. Although I may have to source the ""Kick-Ass"" issues to see what I have been missing. I watch movies for the sheer entertainment value and I was entertained indeed. Where people tell me that a book ""is a really good read"", ""Kick-Ass"" is ""a really good watch"". The characters were so much fun and the action was awesome. Chloë Grace Moretz definitely stole the show. How couldn't you love her wit and sarcasm, not to mention the action scenes? Last year ""Zombieland"" was my runaway favourite for its quirkiness, originality and fun. It looks like ""Kick-Ass"" will be it this year. Hopefully we will see more great stuff from Matthew Vaughn and Jane Goldman."
"dfle3","9","4","14","30 April 2010"," Delivers on the promise of its title and revitalises a tired genre
","The premise of the movie isn't actually exciting for an adult...a movie about child superheroes? Sounds REALLY lame. However, watching a movie review TV show here in Australia it was mentioned that this movie is very violent and the male reviewer expressed concern about the scenes with the young girl superhero. Righto...this could be interesting!<br/><br/>Kick Ass is a pastiche of movie genres...it has an indie cinema vibe to it early on (think ""Juno""), a teen sex comedy element (think of any number of American movies where teenage boys try to 'get laid'), adult comic vibe (superhero movies with 'dark' themes and scenes, like the all time classic ""Watchmen"") etc. And it all works very well together. You'll see scenes and be able to cross out stylistic 'borrowings'...be it ""The Matrix"" or the experience of playing a first person shooter video game (like ""Doom"", say).<br/><br/>Anyway, the movie starts off like it is going to explore what would really happen if anyone tried to become a superhero. The reality is very violent, so it's not a movie I'd recommend for pre-teens. Sure, it has elements that would appeal to them, but the contrast between childish notions of superhero-dom and the 'reality' is very marked and unsuited to younger children...there's some confronting violence in this movie...by characters such as Hit-Girl and towards her character, for instance.<br/><br/>Aaron Johnson plays Dave Lizewski / Kick-Ass and is appropriately geeky as a wannabe superhero/lady's man. The movie contrasts a geek-boy fantasy of being a superhero with 'real' superheroes. In this way the movie is reasonably novel...the crowd after a 'pure' superhero movie may not be so much into these parts of the story.<br/><br/>As for the real superheroes in this movie, Chloe Moretz (as ""Hit-Girl""...looking like a very young Dame Edna Everage!) is the REAL Kick Ass superhero. Recently superhero movies have been disappointing me...especially sequels (Transformers 2 is a big let-down). Moretz transforms and revitalises the genre with a vivacious performance. She has a really bright aura around her...whereas Batman was a dull character in The Dark Knight, overshadowed by Ledger's brilliant turn as ""The Joker"", Hit-Girl makes for an exciting heroine. And all round, this movie is superior to The Dark Knight...take Ledger out of that movie and it suffers for the loss. The incongruity of Hit-Girl (a pre-pubescent girl) in the superhero genre has really killed my fatigue with the genre. Getting a bit paternal, it would be great to see Moretz become a poster girl for climate change scientists or quantum mechanics...but hey, a career playing Hit-Girl would impress people more, I suspect.<br/><br/>It should be noted though, that Hit-Girl uses very strong language, which is another reason this movie is unsuitable for very young children...perhaps. You could say that either Hit-Girl swears like a policeman or that she brings the language of the playground into movies. Of course, there was the similarly young Regan in ""The exorcist"", but her language was attributed to demonic possession...Hit-Girl can't blame supernatual entitities for her potty-mouth though...which is why it's embedded in realism.<br/><br/>Speaking of Batman, Nicolas Cage channels Michael Keaton's Batman at times, in his role as superhero ""Big Daddy"".<br/><br/>Was thinking of giving this movie 10/10. I'm sure that this movie will have great repeat viewing potential, but I'm just marking it down one point for the bits of pastiche that aren't as exciting as the comic book showdowns...I mean all that geeky stuff.<br/><br/>In a way, the prospect of a sequel for this movie is very exciting...be great to see more of Hit-Girl. However, this is such a great fun movie you wonder if creating a sequel would sully its legacy...I doubt if I will see Transformers 3...the first sequel sucked so badly."
"Roseybaby63","10","4","14","28 April 2010"," A great movie that has it all
","When I went to see this movie I wasn't quite sure what to expect. It seemed like it could have been either fun or just a corny satire of some sort. Well....this movie had it all...for me anyway. I was sucked in right from the beginning. I like the idea of regular people wanting to do good and try to be heroic.<br/><br/>I was interested in the characters right away and wanted to see what would happen. Even after getting stabbed and run over by a car, Kick-ass just can't stop wanting to help. When he meets the resident masked heroes, he feels kind of inept. I love Nicholas Cage as Big Daddy. When he's in costume and speaks, he so reminds me of Adam West's delivery in the old Batman show. He's just quirky enough to do his part justice. My favorite of them all is Hit Girl. She's the most fascinating character. Her fight scenes are brilliant. Besides all this, there's some bad guys doing bad things that need to be stopped. There's also a personal vendetta against the big boss by Big Daddy and Hit Girl. I won't spoil anything, but the last fight is a work of beauty.<br/><br/>I'm a fan of comic books, but someone who isn't can enjoy this movie just as much. The story is good and makes enough sense..the action is exciting and the characters are interesting. I absolutely recommend this movie for viewing. Personally, I'd like to see a movie about Hit Girl. Maybe how she became the unstoppable, killing machine that she is. It would be a nice to see Big Daddy raising her. Anyway...go see this movie. It's well worth it."
"jefbtheone","10","4","14","24 April 2010"," Strong performance
","Over the last couple of years I've started to notice the rise of a great actor, Mark Strong. Sherlock Holmes, Body of Lies and RocknRolla - all 3 are worth checking out. And now we have the real stardom with his, pun-intended, strong performance in kick-ass. I just read one review noting the brilliance of the movie because of how it combines ""hilarious comedy with incredibly graphic, stylized violence"" (quote from pgtmatrix's review). Well it could not have been done without Mark Strong.<br/><br/>On a side note, only Nicholas Cage can be the Jean Reno to Natalie Portman in a comic book style comedy. It was just enough character from him to prevent the movie from being over the top or just straight up goofy. He connected well with the style of humor in the movie although I can understand why someone would dislike Nicholas Cage in general.<br/><br/>Usually critics rip apart ultra violent movies or rated R comedies. Nowadays trash talking and bloodshed is just not accepted by critics. It takes this type of movie to shut everyone up. Some critics need to face the fact that they just don't like movies with added profanity and unrealistic killing sprees. If you don't like it better off sticking to PG movies or those deep Tom Hanks movies."
"Red_Identity","Null","4","14","24 April 2010"," A Stylish, Daring, and Gory Action Comedy!
","What Can I say about Kick-Ass. Well, for starters, it definitely lives up to it's name. It is also a very funny High School film that takes place in the world of superheroes (well, in their won world). The film has a clever and outrageous screenplay. It is daring and original in it's approach, and these days that is hard to come by. It reminds me of Sin City in it's totally unrated but fun tone, although in a lighter way. This film crosses so many different films, like Superbad, Kill Bill, Adventureland and combines them to this very entertaining and energetic film. I am not sure that every scene works, but that's because the film has incredibly contrasting tones at times. It is an action film, a comedy, a high school romance, and a crime film, and it succeeds in all of those genres. This film is definitely outlandish and will offend many people because of it's hard rating and the violence portrayed by kids and to kids. But this is a film that has ambition, and joins the ranks of the best comic book films in the last 10 years together with The Dark Knight, Watchmen, and Sin City, because like all of them, it is not merely satisfied with being your average Spider-Man film. Oh, and the soundtrack is KILLER!"
"main-38","7","4","14","24 April 2010"," Wild and Crazy Examination of the Human Condition
","I waited a really long time to see Kick Ass because I have a lot of comic book, fan boy friends who always gripe and complain about how inaccurate the adaptations are and how little attention is paid to details from the original story whenever we get together to watch one of these movies. Honestly, I would rather take a brutal ass kicking than sit through another movie with one of them painstakingly tearing the movie apart. It was for that reason that I stayed home when they went out and saw it and waited until now to get my own, unbiased and completely fan boy free opinion.<br/><br/>The film takes great elements from good old run and gun Kung Fu shoot em' ups, blood soaked, gore fests and sadistic, dark comedies. It combines these elements with initially traditional hero and villain archetypes which audiences members are used to and creates a new, offbeat and non contemporary world where everyday citizens are afraid to face any kind of evil that lurks in the shadows.<br/><br/>That is until a few misfits realize that there are no REAL superheros out there and there's a desperate need for change- as well as a bit of well placed retribution.<br/><br/>In my opinion they cast the Kick Ass character perfectly. Aaron Johnson is the epitome of pathetic and invisible until he dons the skin green and yellow tight scuba suit and Timberlands and takes to the streets. Nick Cage is still Nick Cage, but I take back a few of the things I've said about him (only some). He really diluted himself and became something different than what we're all used to seeing. He didn't even have overtly goofy hair! But, it was really Chloe Moretz that took the cake. Her comedic timing was perfect and, out of all the characters, I felt for her the most. As Hit Girl she was a miniature Uma Thurman in Kill Bill. There are not many movies that come to mind when I think cold blooded killer and also prepubescent girl. It was new and different to see a girl portrayed in movie like this doing the kind of things she did.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a fun movie. On the core it's a mixture of a few very different kind of films. It's both feel good, semi-comedy and also a commentary on society; while it still serves up enough gun Kata inspired violence and fighting to win over even the most stoic of movie nerds. It makes one consider the plight of the human condition when people will turn the other cheek when they see a mugging, although, it sends kind of a positive message that if people are pushed far enough they can do some pretty crazy, amazing things."
"tomdude0","10","4","14","23 April 2010"," The Next Generation of Superhero Films
","I loved this movie! It has a perfect combination of stylized violence and witty humor, something other films have tried and failed at. The acting was superb, as was the storyline.<br/><br/>""Kick-Ass"" is the story of Dave Lizewski, your average high school comic book geek. He decides to become a costumed hero and fight crime because no one else has bothered to. He fails miserably and is severely injured, resulting in surgery in which his bones are mended with metal plates and nerve damage diminishes his ability to feel pain. However, Dave is unfazed and goes out on patrol as Kick-Ass almost immediately after recovering. He breaks up a fight in which one man is being beaten by several others, and a video taken by a bystander becomes a viral sensation.<br/><br/>Later in the film, Kick-Ass meets fellow superheroes Red Mist, Big Daddy, and Hit Girl. Red Mist, like Kick-Ass, is a teen, but he has a dark secret. Big Daddy and Hit Girl are a father-daughter superhero team, Big Daddy being a man of middle age and Hit Girl being his preteen daughter who is a formidable foe and an expert at killing. They unite to take down mobster Frank D'Amico.<br/><br/>My favorite character was Hit Girl. Chloe Moretz did a great job as this foulmouthed, vicious, preteen superhero for an actress of her age. Hit Girl easily stole the show and this movie wouldn't have been the same without her.<br/><br/>My only complaint about this film is that the Big Daddy character wasn't developed very much. Despite Nicolas Cage presenting an impressive performance as the vigilante dressed as Batman, I couldn't help but notice that not much happens with him throughout the film.<br/><br/>In your average superhero movie, the heroes are merciful defenders of the innocent public, and the villains seem like pure evil but they have good inside of their hearts and they change their ways. ""Kick-Ass"" portrays heroes and villains as they would be like in real life: brutal, ruthless, and determined. Frank D'Amico is ruthless. The ""heroes"" do not spare the villains' lives, they gun them down without a second thought.<br/><br/>""Kick-Ass"" is the next generation of superhero movies. It portrays the dark side of human nature as well as just how far some people will go to stand up for what they believe in. The first thought that raced through my mind after seeing ""Kick-Ass"" was: ""Sequel."""
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","4","14","21 April 2010"," Will impress and speak the loudest to genre fans and comic-lovers
","Every comic-book fan has a fantasy lodged in the back of his or her head about what it would be like to be a superhero. ""Kick-Ass"" is the story of said average person and plays out that fantasy scenario under the most realistic conditions possible. How would being a superhero actually work in modern day? Perhaps ""Kick-Ass"" creator Mark Millar went overboard on the geek daydream by fusing as closely as possible both the world of classic comic fantasy and contemporary realism, but fans who hold the genre dear will convert easily to his wavelength and consequently will enjoy ""Kick-Ass"" far more than anyone else. <br/><br/>The movie plays as both ode to and satire of the genre it holds dear, which is by far its greatest attribute. Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) stars as a socially invisible high schooler who, as he begins the journey of manufacturing himself as the superhero Kick-Ass, draws numerous voice-over comparisons between himself and Peter Parker including the classic line ""without great power comes no responsibility."" He has a voice that puberty clearly left behind and he's insecure enough that he plays along with his crush thinking he's gay. His hesitation toward fighting crime reminds us exactly why no sane person would try this in our world.<br/><br/>Staying true to genre convention, even the ""powerless"" Kick-Ass has an origin story. After donning a green wetsuit and setting up a My Space page, he decides to stop a car theft and ends up stabbed and plowed into by a car. Left with numb nerve endings and metal plates throughout his body which he appropriately comments reminds him of the adamantium inside Wolverine of the X-Men, he survives his next crime intervention and in the process becomes a YouTube phenomenon. The attention brings other superheroes out of the woodwork and their crusading generally involves killing people that work for crime boss Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong), who has had enough with the masquerading and wants Kick-Ass among others dead.<br/><br/>Charged with bringing this superhero film for superhero-lovers to life, director Matthew Vaughn (""Layer Cake,"" ""Stardust"") plays with a myriad of techniques to create a genuine comic feel. He imagines the film in segments -- each done with one particular technique or effect and given a mood through a choice in music from video game beats to Ennio Morricone Western themes. One sequence has the 11-year-old girl assassin ""Hit Girl"" (Chloe Moretz) taking baddies down in slow motion, the other more quickly with a coyer camera. Instead of abusing one technique, Vaughn strives for each to stand out on its own.<br/><br/>He also determines when he wants you to take ""Kick-Ass"" seriously and when he doesn't. As part spoof on the genre, he uses some clichéd techniques, but then to reflect Millar's choice to take the story down a darker more serious path, he'll make a choice that impresses you and makes you realize the writing goes above and beyond where the plot of most spoofs go.<br/><br/>The subplot of heavy-artillery daddy-daughter combo Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) and Hit Girl is a unique but essentially classic revenge story and the relationship between crime boss Frank and his son Chris (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) who wants to look up to him creates an unexpected twist on another familiar dynamic. In other words, ""Kick-Ass"" is original storytelling rooted in classic comic traditions and archetypes.<br/><br/>Part of bringing superhero realism to ""Kick-Ass"" also requires honest levels of violence, sexual references and foul language. R-rated film veterans will not be fazed by the level of violence and not deem it gratuitous. And even though much of it is carried out by a foul- mouthed child, Moretz carries an incredible amount of maturity in a performance that more or less steals the film.<br/><br/>""Kick-Ass"" strives to give comic book and superhero fans something they can identify with. Pop culture references abound in this movie and rather than annoy, they help bring ""Kick- Ass"" to eye level with the fan base, as if to say ""we understand why you love these stories because we do too."" Those who don't feel that way about the genre will still find things to like about ""Kick-Ass,"" but will see it at face entertainment value, not as an homage to Hollywood's most powerful storytelling form in the last decade.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site http://moviemusereviews.com"
"cadillac20","9","4","14","21 April 2010"," Fantastic Fun, The True Beginning of the Summer Season
","Kick Ass is a film that has been hyped almost insurmountably. With fan praise, critical hype, and trailers that showed all kinds of fun, one wouldn't be mistaken to think this film might be over-hyped. But after seeing the film, one WOULD be mistaken to think this is anything but a great achievement for comic book films and summer blockbusters.<br/><br/>By now, you should know the basic premise of Kick Ass: an average teenager decides to don a costume and become a superhero. There are no superpowers, no advanced martial arts training, and Kick Ass is no one man army. He's just a kid tired of no one doing anything about the bastards of the world. Helping him are Big Daddy and Hit Girl, two heroes who are highly trained and highly armed, and yes they kick a great deal of ass. Red Mist joins in on the fun halfway through. Together they aim to take down the big baddie of the film, the crime boss running most of NY.<br/><br/>The film itself takes a standard formula for comic book films. There is the progression of becoming the hero: the training, the failures, the costume creation. The villain is introduced. There are a number of fights in between and a final battle that has probably the best action in the whole movie. However, what separates the film from others is both it's brutality and wit. This isn't as much of a fantasy film as say Spider-Man or Batman, where these guys parade around some fantasy version of their city and use it as a playground to take out fantastical villains. It's all grounded in reality. Several scenes are brutal, and even a bit gory, reminding you that this is all very much real. It doesn't feel all that exaggerated either. Although the conclusion is laughably over the top, most of the film is brutal enough that you feel what these characters are going through. Kick Ass' very first endeavor is a good example of this, when everything goes wrong and it lands him in the hospital for quite a long time. It's a reminder that this experience won't be like the others.<br/><br/>It helps that the production is fantastic. All the actors do an excellent job in their respective parts. Aaron Johnson is perfect for the part as the seemingly nervous and nerdy Lizewski. There will no doubt be many comparisons to Peter Parker, as they share many similar qualities, but this one stands out because of his normalcy. As he explains in the film, he's no one special, and this makes him especially relatable. He's the normal guy who's simply fed up with being and seeing people get kicked around. The highlights of the film, however, are Chloe Moretz and Nicholas Cage as Big Daddy and Hit Girl, respectively. They steal the show, not just as their superhero alter ego's, but as a daughter and father. Their relationship is both a big part of the films humor and quite touching. As disturbed as one might be seeing how they are together, it's a sweet relationship that truly stands out. Mark Strong stands out as the mob boss villain. He could have played it over the top, but here he seems very fitting as he portrays an ugly villain that is quite suitable. My one issue is Christopher Plasse, who may be a bit oddly cast as Red Mist. While he does channel a little bit of his McLovin into the role, which seems to work, he seems a bit out of place, especially as the villains son.<br/><br/>The rest of the production is admirable. The directing is quite well done and allows the fight scenes to actually be visible, thankfully, which is coupled with the editing, which is also excellent, the warehouse scene being a key highlight. The script is also highly enjoyable, with quite a bit of wit and humor with all the violence and drama. <br/><br/>Kick Ass is an incredibly enjoyable film that sparks the new season of film. It stands as the first blockbuster and a testament to comic book films and what they can be. But above all, this is a fun film that brings memorable characters to the screen and should leave you smiling when it's all said and done."

"moviemaniac008","10","4","14","20 April 2010"," Big Daddy and Hit-Girl own this film!!
","Kick-Ass. When I first saw the trailer when I was at the th eaters, viewing Sherlock Holmes with a friend, I wasn't too sure. At first glance, with the original green band trailer, I felt that it would be a comedy that would fall flat in the likes of Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg, those who came up with the horrible Epic Fail (did I just say fail? I meant Epic Movie), with the okay Meet the Spartans and this bad disaster film, Disaster Movie. Eventually, my friend invited me this weekend (opening week-end) to see Kick-Ass, and since I just had a bit of money to spend, I sighed and said ''Why not?''. So, Saturday night (I went on Sunday), I you-tubed videos of Kick-Ass, and looked especially at the red-band trailer. And that's when I knew it was going to be a hell of a ride.<br/><br/>For those who have only seen the Green-band trailer (Which is horrible, by the way and does not do the film justice), Kick-Ass seems horrible. Thankfully, the horrible parts of this trailer only appear in the first fifteen minutes of the movie (at one point I felt like leaving because I thought I had just been fooled. Everyone in the auditorium seemed to be laughing when this dude crashes on top of the car, except me). But I am really glad that I did stay to see this film. The typical teen dilemma that happens surrounding Dave (Aaron Johnson) feels highly realistic (and yes, I am a teen, therefore I could relate a bit to Dave when he wasn't wearing his Kick-Ass costume).<br/><br/>The actors were all pretty good. Aaron Johnson is convincing enough as Dave, and Mark Strong is also awesome (except I felt like I had seen him do better in other movies, for instance, Sherlock Holmes). Christopher Mintz-Plasse, whom most of you will recognize as McLovin, from Superbad, has a terrific performance as Red Mist, whom I will not spoil too much on. But the main performances I felt were awesome were Nicholas Cage (Big Daddy, a.k.a Damon Macready) and his supporter, Hit-Girl (Chloe Moretz, a.k.a Mindy Macready). I couldn't understand where all the controversy surrounding her character, because when I was her age, my friends and I would cuss frequently and play war and kill many people in different manners in our heads). Hit-Girl got many laugh out louds from both the audience and myself, whereas Big Daddy had the most awesome scenes. Heck, I felt like watching an action movie whenever Big Daddy was on screen.<br/><br/>Big Daddy's scenes were the best because whenever Nicholas Cage would wear the costume (basically a look-alike of Batman's costume), you would feel his intensity (Big Daddy does not fight every criminal, only the ones he feels interfere with his cause, because he has a specific cause). The music chosen in the background could create with any scene either an atmosphere of intensity like in the warehouse scene where Big Daddy kills a lot of bad guys, or a comedic atmosphere, like Dave most of the time when he does not wear the Kick-Ass costume. Nicholas Cage is also incredible when it comes to creating many funny moments with his daughter Mindy. Their chemistry works perfect.<br/><br/>Story: Dave is a teen who does not know why nobody has ever tried to be a superhero. He buys a scuba suit off the internet, and decides he will become Kick-Ass, a crime fighter. Eventually, Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong), a mobster, hears about Kick-Ass, he decides he will try to stop him once and for all. Kick-Ass meets with Big Daddy and Hit-Girl, and they all team up to fight D'Amico. Perhaps the best thing about Kick-Ass is that it's different. Nobody has ever really tried to make a real, laugh-out-loud comedy based on superheroes. The actors work perfectly, the style is different, the laughs come and go all the time and perhaps the best is the way the action scenes were filmed. Perhaps Kick-Ass is a bit too early to be called a blockbuster yet but if Kick-Ass were to open the blockbuster season, I can definitely predict an awesome summer. If you are fan of hero movies such as Spider-Man, Iron Man, Watchmen, etc... then you will find a few winks here and there. Long live Kick-Ass, and I definitely hope for a sequel."
"dfranzen70","7","4","14","19 April 2010"," Tarantino homage kicks out the violence jams
","Although exceptionally – perhaps even abhorrently, depending on your view – violent and wildly profane, Kick-Ass is terrific, a pulse-quickening superhero movie that somehow manages to have a subtle message about staying true to yourself, or something.<br/><br/>Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) is just another anonymous geek in high school when he comes up with the idea of becoming a superhero. Not one with, you know, super powers or anything, just one with a mask and good intentions. Dave buys a wetsuit and costumes himself as the eponymous hero – and quickly finds himself on the wrong end of a knife. But that's okay, too, because the resulting surgeries implant metal in his body. You know, like Wolverine. Soon, he's back and, uh, kicking ass, and his exploits are all over YouTube.<br/><br/>At the same time, a mob boss named D'Amico (Mark Strong) is running all sorts of deals all over the city: weapons, drugs, graft, murder, and so on. Then eight of his guys are knocked out by a costumed man, and D'Amico – with the help of his sniveling son Chris (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) – decides Kick-Ass is his man, since he's basically the only costumed hero anyone knows about. Soon D'Amico and his well-armed minions are after poor, hapless Dave. Turns out that the costumed man trying to take down D'Amico is Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage), who, with his deceptively adorable daughter Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz), has been targeting D'Amico's operations in a sort of revenge game.<br/><br/>There are a few wonderful themes being developed in this film. One is that ordinary guys can do extraordinary things. Another is that the geek can get the girl, as long as he's honest. A third is that even well-prepared heroes bleed from time to time. Kick-Ass is part Spider-Man and part Quentin Tarantino's World of Comic-Book Heroes. Now, it's true that these themes may not be all that unique, particularly to movies, but the essential take-away point is that the heroes here are infused with no small amount of humanity. They are in no way, shape, or form perfect people; they simply are.<br/><br/>Dave Lizewski doesn't suddenly become awesome when he wears his Kick-Ass costume; he's a great person, daring to stand up for the little guy. When he sees the level of training that Hit Girl and Big Daddy have achieved, he knows he's in over his head. But the experience gives him the confidence to connect with a previously unattainable high-school hottie, Katie. Echoes of Spider-Man, sure, but somehow Johnson is a little more believable than Tobey Maguire.<br/><br/>The violence is pretty visceral – bad guys are mowed down in cold-blooded fashion by ostensibly good guys – but what might really grab you is the incredibly adult performance by Moretz. She's 13, by the way, and she looks like she's 11, but here she talks like she's a grizzled pirate. Moretz uses all of the Carlin dirty words and some more you might not have heard of. It's a little off-putting to hear such a tiny little squirt use such language, especially while engaging in bloody, realistic combat, and it wouldn't surprise me to learn that her role is viewed with some controversy. Moretz's Hit Girl is very reminiscent of Gogo Yubari from Kill Bill Vol. 1, but her Kewpie Doll looks serve an even greater contrast to her intentions and actions.<br/><br/>Kick-Ass is both evocative and heart warming. It's not the kind of movie you watch while cuddling with a honey, though, as its sweeter side is mostly kept in the background. But it's those sweet moments that help prevent the film from being a rudderless mess."
"moviewizguy","7","4","14","18 April 2010"," I can't read your mind. But I can kick your ass.
","""How come nobody's ever tried to be a superhero?"" When Dave Lizewski dons a wetsuit to become the no-nonsense vigilante, Kick-Ass, he soon finds an answer to his own question: because it hurts. But, overcoming all the odds, Dave quickly becomes a phenomenon, capturing the imagination of the public. However, he's not the only superhero out there – the father-daughter crime-fighting duo, Big Daddy and Hit Girl, have been taking down the criminal empire of local Mafioso, Frank D'Amico. And, as Kick-Ass gets drawn into their world of bullets and bloodletting with Frank's son, Chris, the stage is set for a final showdown between the forces of good and evil - in which the DIY hero will have to live up to his name. Or die trying...<br/><br/>KICK-ASS is one of those movies that is difficult to market to the mainstream audience, especially since the opening weekend for this film was disappointing. It has a lot of bloody violence along with a little girl who makes people think that this is a kiddie flick and the fact that this film is rated R just brings a whole lot of mess and confusion to the table of what this film really is. The best way I can describe what this film is is SPIDER MAN mixed with ZOMBIELAND without the zombies.<br/><br/>Unlike the title of the film might suggest, Kick-Ass does end up being overshadowed by the characters of Big Daddy and Hit Girl. In fact, I'll even go as far to say that Hit Girl herself made the movie what it is. She's such a fantastic, awesome, wild, brilliant, colorful, bad-ass character that I liked her more than Kick-Ass. Chloe Moretz plays the said character so well, that she lightens up the screen every time she comes on. You thought the profanity-mouthed kid in ROLE MODELS was shocking? You haven't seen anything yet.<br/><br/>However, saying that, Aaron Johnson as Kick-Ass did a great job as well. I can relate to the nerd-type character he plays. Nicolas Cage is a mixed-bag. In some scenes, he's brilliant, while in others, he's rather weird. Mark Strong as the villain is more of the same from SHERLOCK HOLMES a couple of months back. Still, he has some great scenes with comic timing. Christopher Mintz-Plasse doesn't have much screen time as the trailers suggested, but he's good for the amount of time he appears in the film.<br/><br/>It's apparent the main goal of the film is to entertain its audience and it succeeds at that. The film is filled with bloody violence, vulgar language, and big laughs, most coming from my favorite character Hit Girl. Because of this, however, the many themes touched upon in this film is never fully explored, which could have made the movie a so much better. There are some really moving scenes as well, along with suspense in the fantastically shot action scenes.<br/><br/>The main flaw of the film comes from the tone. It found a hard time whether to be a straight-up comedy or a dramedy because somewhere in this film, it does get serious and dark, unlike the marketing might have suggested. In some parts of the film, I didn't know when to laugh or not. Because of this, I didn't enjoy the film as much as I would have enjoyed it.<br/><br/>However, with these flaws aside, director Matthew Vaughn successfully delivers to the audience an action-packed popcorn flick with great characters. I found the movie to be ludicrously entertaining from beginning to end with a lot of big laughs and some bad ass action scenes. This is the very definition of an awesome movie. I know I'm not the first person to say this but KICK-ASS kicks ass (for the most part)."
"loccomotive2000","8","4","14","17 April 2010"," No Powers, No Gadgets, No Problem.
","Whoever said you needed superpowers or high-tech gadgets to be a superhero? In KICK-ASS, Dave Lizewski proves just that as the titular hero, fighting with nothing but lean, mean determination and desire to uphold justice.<br/><br/>Aaron Johnson does a great job as the hero geek, morphing from a shy pushover into a full-fledged crime-fighter in a green suit who would die in a split second to protect his tiny little philosophy and mission. Nicolas Cage pays homage to the 60s Batman and revels in his role as the vengeance seeking ex-cop. But the show stealer here comes no bigger than the size of 12-year-old Chloë Moretz, dispelling all those images of adolescent girls those tween queens on magazine covers have given you. As Hit Girl, she disposes her enemies faster than Superman could finish his heroic opening statement, and does so with unceremonious aggression and minimum fuss. The fact that she's so young differs from those femme fatales in that she does not rely on any sort of sexual appeal to make her character more attractive or intriguing; she doesn't have one, she didn't need one. She's awesome fully because she took down seven guys and left one pissing in his pants, putting the Batgirls and Elektras to shame.<br/><br/>Perhaps most worth applauding is the no holds barred direction of the visual style and action of this movie. Too often, films have been toned down and made bland to avoid the R-rating and often causes creative integrity to suffer. From start to end, however, Kick-Ass showed absolutely no concern for going ""overboard"". There's no holding back from the excessive cursing, blood and gore of the movie that you could be forgiven if you thought Tarantino was behind this. <br/><br/>All in all, KICK-ASS is a refreshing take on the now badly exploited superhero genre, and is capable of taking itself seriously at times yet provide mindless entertainment with witty humor and high-octane action that promises to keep you at the edge of your seat. A terrific way to start the summer of 2010."
"Afflock","9","4","14","17 April 2010"," A well done film worth seeing.
","The naysayers missed the point and context. This movie is NOT for kids, the R-Rating is proof enough. <br/><br/>Hit Girl is an awesome movie.. er... I mean Kick-Ass. The positive comments say it all. Well done film that gets so much right that it is easy to overlook the very few minor flaws. It is based on a comic book, so some artistic liberty is allowed, yes? <br/><br/>The character Kick-Ass is well developed and is the one person who ties the whole movie together. The main storyline is more about Hit Girl and Big Daddy. The theme is created by Kick-Ass and his vision of people standing up for what is right. The movie has a noticeable Tarrentino influence. It does quote other movies and mocks it in a dead pan style that does not say, ""hey we are mocking this film now"". You have to catch the references. <br/><br/>Was a little disappointed in the turn out on a Saturday night of the opening weekend. Probably 60 people in a 850 capacity theatre. It may be a late bloomer or a sleeper in the theatres. It is worth seeing on the big screen. Very entertaining and has some good funny moments. There are a few jaw dropping moments when you say, ""no they did not just do that"". It has a few surprises that will make you laugh or cringe and chuckle. The few obvious set ups on what will happen next won't make you feel disappointed (oh boy that was predictable), but you will find yourself wanting to see how it turns out and anticipating the next scene or twist. <br/><br/>Well done with good chemistry among the cast. The tempo, editing, cinematography, writing, and directing mixed very well together. It is one of the better films, technically speaking, that has been out in a while. <br/><br/>The first 15 min of character development pays off in the last 30 minutes of the film. It makes you cheer for the main characters. The sound track makes it fun. The ending does set it up for a potential sequel, but not in an annoying way, the plot lines are all tied up. Normally I would not see a movie twice, but this one would be good to see with a group of people. It will be fun to discuss afterwords over dinner or coffee. <br/><br/>See the film and decide for yourself. Don't take the kids. Bring friends."
"colinrgeorge","8","4","14","13 April 2010"," ""Kick-Ass""
","The ultraviolent, postmodern ""Kick-Ass"" is at the forefront of the comic book movie scene at a volatile turning point. The '00s were defined in no small part by Hollywood's Spidermen, Batmen, and X-Men, and until ""Avatar"" rolled around, they were the box office champions smashing records every year. Now Raimi's ""Spiderman"" has fizzled out and is being rejiggered by Sony, the ""X-Men"" franchise has devolved into schlock, and ""Batman,"" while healthy, represents the superhero sub-genre at its most pointedly operatic.<br/><br/>""Kick-Ass"" takes a fresh approach, smartly deconstructing comic book ideology in a meta- comedy that satirizes convention while simultaneously drawing from it. As a movie based on a comic book about comic book geeks, there's a degree of self-conscious irony to watching a fake superhero narrative snowball into a real one. It pokes fun at the melodrama of origin stories even as it unfurls its own. ""Kick-Ass"" follows protagonist Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson), who's as big a dweeb as Spiderman's alter ego Peter Parker, but without the chip on his shoulder and radioactive spider bite. Lizewski is roundly average, and ultimately more believable than Parker; his superhero dress rehearsal doesn't end victorious in an underground fighting ring—It ends in an ambulance after being knifed in a parking lot. <br/><br/>Undeterred, Lizewski tackles pet rescue and petty theft until a passerby records one of his more marginally successful street brawls on a cell phone camera, and his alias, 'Kick-Ass' becomes an overnight YouTube celebrity. His sudden prominence heralds dozens of copycat heroes, but even the progenitor finds himself outmatched by the likes of ""Big Daddy"" (Nick Cage), and his deadly 12-year-old daughter, ""Hit-Girl"" (Chloe Moretz), a character that truly tests the audience as accessories to vigilante justice. <br/><br/>There's already controversy brewing, though personally, I find it a little hard to buy into the offense. The exponential brutality of the violence perpetrated not only against Kick-Ass and Hit-Girl later in the film, but more importantly by them, is appalling on some level, sure. But it's taken to an extent that's pure slapstick. At heart, ""Kick-Ass"" is gory, bloody comedy. <br/><br/>But a comedy nonetheless. Maybe it's all the more troubling that Hit-Girl's casual propensity for murder is played for laughs, but I think we laugh at Hit-Girl for the same reason we laugh at Bugs Bunny, even when he's got a shotgun in Elmer Fudd's mouth: it's classic comedic role reversal. Who doesn't want to see the wabbit humiliate the hunter? If anything, ""Looney Tunes"" is less responsible in its depiction of violence because there's no consequence of the shotgun blast. Hit-Girl's action sequences are deliriously destructive, unbelievably graphic, and a hell of a lot of fun. <br/><br/>And that's really what I love most about ""Kick-Ass."" Even (or especially) in the face of violence, it doesn't take itself seriously, nor would I argue it directly purports its characters as heroes in the traditional sense. No one seems especially concerned that they're held up as role models, and what's endearing, hilarious, and horrifying about their behavior shines through because of it.<br/><br/>This is ballsy commercial film-making, which is likely why seven studios passed on the script last year. It takes risks that may alienate some in the mainstream, and its success has already been capped somewhat by the hard R rating, but I don't think ""Kick-Ass"" is the sort of film that will go out without a fight. If not a huge hit like the PG-13 Spidermen and Batmen of years past, it's got real cult appeal, and because it's uncompromising in its premise—Even to a fault in the uneven gradient from reality to comic book reality, ""Kick-Ass"" is the sort of film with staying power. And if this is where we're headed, count me in."

"Troy_Campbell","9","4","14","4 April 2010"," 117 minutes of unadulterated, unashamed fun.
","A loser who forms a superhero alter ego without having any actual superpowers. An 11 year old girl with a foul mouth who loves a shoot up. McLovin as Red Mist. What's not to like? And this is just what we saw in the shorts. To say Matthew Vaughn has delivered the goods promised in the trailer (not a certainty these days – yes G.I. Joe, we're looking at you) is an understatement. Less concerned with what audiences expect and more interested in taking the preconceptions of what a superhero movie should look like and warping them around his twisted little finger, Vaughn delights in taking the unexpected turn. From the opening guffaw about a winged crusader to the closing line taken straight from a fellow comic-book movie, Kick-Ass issues a swift kick up the backside of the audience for thinking they know better.<br/><br/>Vaughn made a name for himself in the movie biz as the producer of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch. Spending that time with Guy Ritchie has reaped some obvious rewards, not least his flair for spectacular bloodshed. It's not just the ultra-violence itself that is done well though, it is the hyper-kinetic action set pieces surrounding it that really provide the eye-popping, awe-inducing entertainment. The slow motion scene where Hit Girl unleashes her rage on Big Daddy's captors is truly magnificent – a mesmeric scene to remember for years to come – whilst the claret-filled finale will have a smile on your face from ear to ear thanks to the inventive, tongue-in-cheek brutality. All off the action sequences are done so well that you may – to quote Po from Kung Fu Panda – go blind from over-exposure to pure awesomeness.<br/><br/>Casting to perfection, Vaughn has assembled a group of actors that fit their roles completely. Johnson induces our sympathy and cheers all at once, his Dave is a typical teenage boy with geeky friends (played comically by Clark Duke and Evan Peters) and no chance with women, but thankfully isn't a sad sack or a little brat like majority of adolescent characters that feature in the movies. Hitting career-top form with the slightly crazy Big Daddy is Cage; the role flits between psycho vigilante and doting father which allows the Oscar winner to play with small tics and nuances, which is what he has always done best. Mintz-Plasse and Strong are also on solid form as the cowardly costumer Red Mist and vociferous gangster D'Amico respectively, Mintz-Plasse especially impressive as he breaks through the McLovin stereotype he's been cursed with for the last few years.<br/><br/>Make no mistake though, there is one standout performance that soars above the rest. Only 11 years old when filming, Moretz plays Hit Girl with such confidence and panache that she single-handedly runs away with the film. Moretz sprouts off quotable dialogue with a fantastically smug expression, her pitch-perfect delivery resonates life experience well beyond her years. Her colourful language and uncompromisingly vicious fighting skills may have conservative groups getting their knickers in a twist, but for the rest of us it just makes her one of the coolest characters we've seen for a while – it is only a movie after all.<br/><br/>Kick-Ass is 117 minutes of unadulterated, unashamed fun. Pure and simple.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)"

","When I saw this back in the cinema, I had no idea what it was about. I didn't know what to expect and only know the basic plot. The movie came out as a Kill-Bill meets Spider-Man and Watchmen movie. It was a nice surprise, and definitely worth seeing (the person I saw it with wanted to see it again!) Kick-Ass follows a teenager in High School who wonders what it would be like to be a superhero and decides to be one himself: Kick-Ass. He stumbles upon other people following the same routine as him, but discovers its not that easy to pull it off in the real world.<br/><br/>Like I said, if you had no idea what it was about. Then you'll probably end up liking it a lot, and the movie is quite gory for what it is. Make no mistake, this is not a movie for children! I am glad to have seen this, and all the cast was great in it too! (Yep, even Nicolas Cage!). The movie in my opinion was not advertised enough (at least not in the UK) and I think quite a lot of people are going to miss it, but who knows."
"Prichards12345","8","4","14","27 March 2010"," Lives up to its title
","Fans of the graphic novel - expect some pretty big changes; but to my mind they are there for cinematic reasons and make perfect sense. Kick Ass is a movie that really works, makes you care about the characters and delivers laughs and violence. Usually at the same time! The first half of the film sets things up perfectly: when shy high schooler Dave Lizewski decides to become a superhero he orders a wet suit on the internet, and goes out in search of superhero action.The sequence where he dons his ""costume"" for the first time is a treat, riffing on De Niro in Taxi Driver. Indeed the movie is full of pop culture references that are never heavy handed but pulled off with wit and style. Spider-Man, Tarantino, Clint Eastwood. You name it it's in there.<br/><br/>Will everyone really be getting all hot and bothered about Hit Girl's now infamous opening line? Nah, this is 2010. And besides, it's exactly the right thing to say! We also have something of a career resurrection for Nicholas Cage delivering a comic gem of a performance. However it's Aaron Johnson you'll remember - those puppy dog, Frodoesque eyes of his sticking out of that ridiculous costume! What a find he is. The cast are all terrific. Mark Strong seems to be everywhere at the moment, and he makes an excellent heavy. Chloe Moretz is also a fantastic Hit Girl. She made me believe that a 10 year old girl could make mincemeat out of the Mafia.<br/><br/>Have to say that things slacken occasionally around the mid-point, perhaps a little tighter editing would have helped, but this is a minor issue; in the main the film delivers big time. The end may cheese off some of the GN fans, as it's way way over the top: to me that was all part of the cinematic fun. The movie also has a great soundtrack, from Morricone to er, Sparks. Jane Goldman and Matthew Vaughn, the team behind the excellent Stardust, have got another winner here."

","From out of nowhere comes what could possibly be the most vibrant, satirical, subversive comic-genre movie since Paul Verhoeven's 'Robocop'. This very violent, and very funny, superhero romp's cheerful exterior is littered with booby traps that will sucker punch you into submission. <br/><br/>Superbly adapted by director Vaughn and co-writer Goldman from Mark Millar & John Romita's graphic-novel of the same name, this razor-sharp concoction of comedy and bone-crunching action takes bang-on-target swipes at the Youtube/X-Factor generation to deliver a timely snapshot of this (seemingly) never-ending, reality-TV/Celebrity obsessed era. <br/><br/>Johnson's no-mark, schoolboy wallflower turned angst-free costumed crime fighter with no purpose/powers, is a welcome breath of fresh air to this over stuffed genre, as real life repeatedly crashes in on his Spiderman attempts at super-heroics - ie: he gets seriously, seriously hurt. <br/><br/>But the fun really begins when he finds himself truly out of his depth when he unwittingly locks horns with the real deal: Cage's superb Batman send-up 'Big Daddy', and the much hyped, controversial, murderous tot - 'Hitgirl'. Add Mark Strong's vicious hoodlum and pseudo-superhero son 'Red Mist' (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) to the colour-coded mix, and you have one of the most engaging and entertaining bunch of characters to waltz across the screen since 'Superbad' (which this movie draws favourable comparisons with).<br/><br/>And finally, any piece of celluloid that has the Daily Mail's resident, right-wing knee-jerker film 'critic' (Christopher Tookey) foaming at the mouth about it's 'Disturbing' content, has got to be a serious contender for movie of the century! <br/><br/>Verdict: Awesome!"

","In a lot of ways this movie had heart and that is something I love to find in a movie going experience. Regular guys tried to be something special in reaction to the apparent disinterest most people have in helping others in need. We have all heard the stories of people just standing by while witnessing a violent crime without even lifting a finger to help the person in trouble. In fact it is common that when people see someone hurting someone else the first impulse is to pull out the phone, and not to dial 911 but to film the action so they can post it online. Where is chivalry? Where is love thy neighbor? Well this movie shows its heart when a regular kid tries to be a hero, and that makes for a great story. There are quite a few good laughs. Where the film falls short is in its inability to resist delving in the vulgar and grotesque. I don't care to see a kid masturbating to online pornography, or to hear a pre-teen/early teen girl cuss like a sailor. The fight scenes are also over the top bloody and gory. To see a little girl slice people up with so much gore is just plain wrong. I believe that the film makers thought they were being funny and clever with these scenes, but all they are doing is desensitizing the audience more and more to what are horrible acts. None of this is necessary for the sake of comedy and entertainment. It is appealing to the lowest common denominator and ultimately takes away from the effectiveness of the comedy. This really could have been much better."

","1. OK. stars are stupid but it got your attention. 2. I feel strongly about this pic. I've paid to see it three times in 7 days. 3. basic description: there is a core story and then there are layers of commentary overlaid: a prologue (guy on building),and epilogue (returning to normal life), a soundtrack, and a voice-over narration. 4. For me, the core story is disturbing, pathetic, tragic,with moments that are utterly grotesque. A great picture, and very lovely, but very hard to watch. 5. The function of the ""commentaries"" seems to me to undermine the impact of the story, to say everything is no big deal. But, saying something is funny doesn't make it funny. and saying it's no big deal doesn't make it no big deal. The ""commentaries"" only confuse, by attempting to trivialize what is profound on its face. (I admit the music is absolutely apt most of the time, I just have a couple of instances where key scenes are trivialized by the music (and no I don't mean the first big scene with Hit Girl and the Banana Splits theme). 6. The picture is so strong that for the most part it survives for me, but apparently not everyone is so lucky, based on the reviews of most of the reviews, which seem to think the story is some sort of cute funny joke. But the last (third!) time I saw it I absolutely cringed at every line of the voice-over. What a load of b.s. I'm beginning to wonder whether this stuff was laid on before the distributors got a look at it, to make it more attractive, or whether the distributors actually asked for these additions before they would buy. either way it's a shame."

","So, just watched kick-ass. So many great performances, an amazing storyline, and a swearing 11 year old girl. I LOVED THIS MOVIE. First of all, Aaron Johnson (dave) was very good. I have been waiting so long to say this, nick cage did great in this film. By far his best film. Chloe Moretz (hitgirl) did great, she was by far the best performer in this film. She was very funny, and played her role great. Lyndsy Fonseca (katie) did very well too. She is also very hot, i might add. And Christopher Mintz-Plasse (Chris a.k.a Mclovin) was also very good. I would not recommend this to anyone under 14, or even above, but that all just depends on maturity. It is very dirty. But again i say, it was a great movie, good storyline, and amazing actors. I'm putting this one in my top 5. It is well deserved as its place in the IMDb top 250. GREAT MOVIE."
"D_Burke","8","4","15","17 April 2010"," Does This Movie Kick Ass? Yes, mostly.
","A few dozen films come out every year that are hyped up to the point where you hear about them at least 20 times a day up until their theatrical release. ""Kick-Ass"" is definitely one of those films. I was excited to see it, but I tried desperately to keep the preparation to be disappointed just so not to be let down. So without reading any reviews beforehand (which, for me, was like being on a deserted island and trying not to think about water), I kept this question in mind before and after the movie: Does ""Kick-Ass"", in fact, kick ass?<br/><br/>There were things I loved about ""Kick-Ass"", most notably the story. The best way to really enjoy this film is if you know as little about it as possible, because the film has so many plot twists that would be shocking enough had it not been for the violence in this film. I'm a big action film fan myself, and there was seldom an action sequence in this film, aided by special effects or not, that didn't make me flinch. If you know nothing about this film going in, you will be entertained by the action alone, provided you're not faint of heart.<br/><br/>I also love the premise of this movie, which was really well executed. I liked the idea that despite comic book movies being the biggest box office draw of the last decade (if you don't count ""Avatar"" (2009), although that could have been based on a comic), very few real life people really have tried to be super heroes. There's a great dialogue in the beginning between high school geek and Kick-Ass to be Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) and his comic book loving pals (Clark Duke and Evan Peters) about why no one has really tried it in real life. They delve beyond the obvious reason (i.e. because no one really has super powers), and make some very good points that also remained hilarious.<br/><br/>Dave, despite not being athletic in the slightest or knowing any fighting skills of any kind, somehow becomes motivated enough to buy a green and yellow wetsuit online, and use that as his superhero costume. Without giving too much away, he never really wins a fight, but becomes a YouTube sensation, attracting the unwanted attention of a mob boss Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong), and perhaps the wanted attention of real life superheroes Hit-Girl (11-year-old Chloe Grace Moretz) and Big Daddy (Nicholas Cage).<br/><br/>It's when this father and daughter team come into the story that the film delves into unpredictable territory and enhances the story. A lot of controversy has been made about Moretz's language in the film. Truth be told, she only says about three or four swear words throughout the film. Some reviews I couldn't avoid made her out to have Joe Pesci dialogue. Truth be told, the scenes where she's killing people are far more intense than her PG-13 language. Overall, though, Moretz was a welcome presence on screen whose was well developed as a character and exhibited a lot of charm throughout the film. She was funny and unexpectedly warm in ""500 Days of Summer"" (2009), and she's the same in this movie on a different level.<br/><br/>I also didn't expect to like Cage's character as much as I did. The scenes between him and Moretz are never dull, often times funny, and surprisingly poignant even when he shoots her point blank in the chest (you have to see the movie). Cage really could have hammed this role up to the extreme, and given that he wears glasses in this film, I half expected him to use that annoying nasally voice he used in ""Peggy Sue Got Married"" (1986). Fortunately, his performance in this movie was over the top enough so much so that you still cared enough about the character. There's even a great scene that's animated comic book style which gives the background of Cage's character. Once you see that scene, which tells an awesome story in and of itself, your sympathy points are hooked on Big Daddy and never let go.<br/><br/>Soon enough, another faux superhero falls into the mix, namely Kick-Ass' high school acquaintance Chris D'Amico, who becomes Red Mist by night and is played by Christopher ""McLovin"" Mintz-Plasse. As much as I thought Mintz-Plasse was funny in films like ""Superbad"" (2007), I felt like here he was miscast. There's a twist to his character that you learn not from watching the previews, but one quarter of the way through the film. His character is important and adds to the story, but I found myself not knowing whether he was supposed to be funny or not, and neither did the people who were in the theater with me. I felt as though the lines he spoke that were meant to be funny fell flat, and the nasally voice that worked for him as McLovin felt out of place here. I didn't feel he was meant to be a nerdy character in this movie, and he just felt out of place. Another actor could have played him better.<br/><br/>Revealing more about this film would take away the sheer thrill of it. Skip the reviews (except this one, of course) and go see it. There is seldom a dull moment in this film. The violence is very graphic, but always contributes to the story. The acting is very good so much so that you care about all the characters. I thought a few lines felt flat and uninspired here and there, but I recommend ""Kick-Ass"" because it kicked ass for the most part. It's violent and vulgar in many areas, making its R-rating well deserved. It's still entertaining as hell without succumbing to mindlessness, and should be viewed on the big screen. I recommend it!"
"blackmambamark","9","4","15","15 April 2010"," A comic book lovers wet dream
","Since ""Iron Man"" and ""The Dark Knight"", the bar for comic book movies has been raised to a far grander medium. They showed us that these movies can be enjoyable, and yet maintain a large amount of depth to both story and character. Since then, every comic company is scrambling, trying to mimic their image. Almost all the Marvel characters, including ""Spiderman"", are being re-booted, and studios are scrambling to find the next big thing.....the next hidden gem. Well, with a name like ""Kick Ass"", it better be one movie that lives up to it's name if it wants to survive.<br/><br/>First, let me go ahead and assume that we have all seen ""Spiderman""......okay, good........this movie starts out almost the same way. Geeky kid, no place or purpose, decides that he is going to finally take on crime himself and become a superhero. Pretty basic, you kind of expect what is going to happen with this story, seeing that we have all seen it before......and then BAM! It does a total 180......but in the most entertaining way possible. And this moment alone, tells you that this is not your typical superhero movie.<br/><br/>I cannot even begin to describe how entertaining this movie is. Everything from the characters, to the dialogue, to the action sequences.........this movie is a comic book lovers wet dream. It was funny, it was gory, and i kid you not, there were some cinematic sequences in this movie that literally had my jaw in the floor. Example: One of our famed superhero's, a little 9 year old girl, is blasting the hell out of bad guys to the theme song from ""A Fistfull of Dollars"".......i mean that is straight Tarantino. So don't be fooled by all the funny costumes, and somewhat humorous title. This movie has a great storyline, and told in a very entertaining fashion. And much like ""Iron Man"", it deserves to be taken seriously. But don't get me wrong, the movie is filled to the brim with brilliantly placed humor that had me laughing so hard that i was crying. So to pretty much sum it up.......its a movie that has everything......action, humor, serious story, and entertaining characters.<br/><br/>Now i simply must talk about the characters. Because they are really what made this work. It's not like most comic book movies, where only one or maybe two characters are entertaining to watch. In this one, everyone is worth watching. Each superhero has their own little personality that makes them so unique, and un-comparable to anyone else. But even though they are all entertaining......the one that stands alone, is Hit Girl. I will easily go down in saying that this character is not only one of the most entertaining superhero's every created, but one of the single most entertaining characters even written in film. I will not go into any detail, because finding it out for yourself makes it even better.......but god damn. You remember the feeling you got when you saw Heath Ledger as the Joker. And you remember saying to yourself ""Man, they could make a whole movie about him and it would be awesome""......yeah, its the same case here. This is a character that will have everyone talking for years to come......it was that good.<br/><br/>Bottom Line, Another bar in the comic book genre' has been set. Now i know that the phrase ""A movie that has everything"" has been tossed around a lot......but this movie really does have everything. Imagine a mix between ""Spiderman"", ""Kill Bill"", and ""Superbad""......three very different movies right? But take the best from all three, and you got this film. Also, one thing that i must touch upon, is the fact that this movie would have probably failed if it were not rated ""R"". Because the fact that this movie takes everything to the edge, makes it fun to watch. So watch out 2010 Summer Blockbusters, because this movie has set an incredibly high bar. ""Kick Ass"" lives up to its name and more."
"vortex007","9","4","15","9 April 2010"," Do ya still wanna become a superhero?
","I've been lucky to see that movie yesterday on the special showing at the biggest Moscow theater before the official Russian release date. Though I'm not a real admirer of the films based on comic books due to it's tend to be boring and silly, there are some good pictures in that vein which I find rather good. For instance ''Iron Man'' or ''Dark Knight''. This time my scrupulous attention was attracted by the matter of fact that it's a kinda parody movie. I'm saying ''kinda'' because ''Kick Ass'' is also based on the comic book, but this book in comparing with others is fairly untypical mainly for the specific approaching to superhero idea and a comedy script. Seen references in press and comments of other people were quite good therefore I couldn't avoid the opportunity to see it.<br/><br/>Have you ever dreamed to become a superhero in your childhood? I guess you did. But now try to remember what had always stopped you? Yes right! Even in our childhood we had a perception that in real life we will definitely be beaten, that somebody will obviously kick our ass. Dave Lizewski is the same guy with the same dreams, but the difference is that he attempted to make his dream come true. He bought a superhero costume in the internet shop and went out on the streets to struggle against a crime and establish the justice. Of course No wonder he's got clobbered twice, but despite of it he has rapidly become a famous star. Just because of his non-careless attitude.<br/><br/>''I don't wanna be involved'', ''Why should I help someone?'', ''It's not my problem'' that's what constantly people thinking while somebody's in danger. And when they are eventually finding themselves in a tight corner, they start to complain of no one didn't try to help them. It's a deep and serious society problem, nobody cares 'bout each other issues, usually people even afraid to call the police. And even though this is a comedy ''Kick Ass'' tries to awake feeling that you always have a capacity to help, that you shouldn't keep yourself aloof from the real problems.<br/><br/>But it was a lyrical digression. Of course this movie should be considered as funny comedy which parodies comic movies. Matthew Vaughn had satisfied almost all spectators' demands. Perpetual jokes permanently fuels during entire film, I was literally writhing in hysterics while watching it. Clumsy hero in stupid hydro costume, idiotic tandem of Nicholas Cage (who parodied the Batman) and his little daughter, stupid mafia made me laughing all the time. Definitely this is the funniest film of this year. Elaborately madden action scenes delighting eyes, since ''Kill Bill'' I don't remember so brutal, cruel with lotta blood and violence film. Another one good side is that ''Kick Ass'' ain't overextended like the most of such movies, it isn't become annoying in the middle.<br/><br/>No doubt this is amazing stuff to spend vacations or after working evening greatly. The only one minus is that for obvious reasons you cannot take your children (if you have them) on this film. Rest of all is great, if you have an opportunity to see it, don't hesitate!"
"snowmalamute","9","4","15","3 April 2010"," Open your mind!
","An original look at comic ""heroes"". Very smart movie. It makes you think it's a comic based film, but it has so much more to offer. It never loses touch with reality. The little girl steals the show, she really kicks some ass, but we were reminded she's just a little girl no matter how mature she appears to be. The second last action scene is one of the best I've seen recently. Highly recommended! People who criticise this film because of the violence and the little girl needs to wake up. This is a film, and it is not inspired by a true story, if you believe everything you see is a bad example then maybe you should not watch any films at all."

","I saw this film when it first came out in the cinema and really enjoyed it. This week it came to our TV screens in a slightly cut version (about 4 minutes shorter than the theatrical release) but that didn't spoil my enjoyment of it. It was one of the best films I saw last year and the filmmakers will have to work hard to beat it again this year! If anything, I enjoyed it more second time around (if that's possible!). But enough of my prattling on, here's a short summary before I give you my thoughts (summary haters and those that don't wish to know anything about the plot please practice swearing with Hit Girl while I write the next paragraph).<br/><br/>Dave Lizewski is an average teenage school kid, he says he has one superpower, he's invisible to girls. He and his friends, Marty and Todd, are into comic books and after hanging out one evening they are mugged by a couple of scumbags. It seems this is not the first time this has happened and Dave is getting a little fed-up with it. He goes online and gets himself a costume, a green wet-suit. After a bit of self-training, he decides he's ready and 'Kick-Ass' is born. He decides to confront the two muggers who held up him and his friends but things don't go well and he ends up having his ass kicked. After recovering in hospital and being screwed together with metal plates he finds his nerve endings are a bit damaged, which means he can take a bit more of a beating than before. Meanwhile, a real Superhero known as 'Big Daddy' is training his eleven year old daughter, 'Hit Girl'. They have a grudge against crime boss Frank D'Amico who framed 'Big Daddy' some years before. D'Amico's son, Chris is disillusioned with his father and decides to become a Superhero himself, called Red Mist in order to lure Kick-Ass out of hiding. They blame Kick-Ass for some losses they have been suffering recently. Kick-Ass eventually gains notoriety when he beats up three guys picking on another guy. The fight is filmed and put up on the internet, bringing a lot of media interest in Kick-Ass. Dave is also noticed by Katie Deauxma, although she doesn't know his secret identity, and thinks he's gay. I won't say too much more, but needless to say all of these various characters are destined to meet, and when they do I'll have to leave it there or I'll be having a knock at the door from the 'Spoiler Police' (& I don't want that).<br/><br/>I must first say that it is a really well made film with some excellent stunt work. I thought the music chosen for the score was really great as well. Excellent performances from all of the leading cast, Aaron Johnson as Dave Lizewski/Kick-Ass, Nicolas Cage as Damon Macready/Big Daddy, Chloe Moretz as Mindy Macready/Hit-Girl, Mark Strong as Frank D'Amico, Christopher Mintz-Plasse as Chris D'Amico/Red Mist and Lyndsy Fonseca as Katie Deauxma.<br/><br/>There is a lot of humour in this film, both spoken and visual. It's also very very violent, so I wouldn't recommend it to those of a nervous disposition. I don't usually enjoy teen comedies, but this is very original, very different and it's very refreshing to see a film that pushes the boundaries somewhat. It's a film that any superhero film fan should try to watch at least once a year and I recommend it very highly! My score: 9.2/10"
"ElMaruecan82","4","3","10","4 January 2011"," ""Kick-Ass"", symptomatic of what is wrong with film-making today ...
","With such a pretentious title, you would think you're gonna watch a comedy or a parody or a fun, entertaining action movie ... well, that's what I expected. The movie started with an excellent premise, a clever mix between ""Superbad"" and any comic-book movie. In fact, I loved the plot idea of giving a chance to an average nobody to become a super-hero. With this mindset, I thought we'd have time to let the character grow on us, to feel sympathy for him, and to observe his evolution into a real original super-hero. I thought it would be a mix between a comedy with witty dialogs and funny visual gags and a heart-warming coming-of-age story. For me, that's the way the movie started ...<br/><br/>And then, the tone radically changes. Big Daddy and his super little daughter make their entrance. I thought the pivotal moment would come from the hero, not from outsiders. No, it was like the director changed his mind and said ""let's not waste our time now, we've got to ""kick some ass"", to shock, let's play ..."" And then we see, two skilled superheroes who make you totally forget about the premise of the film ... <br/><br/>We are supposed to discuss the believability of such heroes like Superman or Batman, aren't we? Then why, suddenly, the movie shows us one of the most dangerous and spectacular super heroines ever created with gadgets and Batmanesque weapons? a little girl who seemed to enjoy massacring people!!! what the hell was that?! the movie turned into an irresponsible mess, committed by a Tarantino wannabe. I'm sorry but as gruesome as the killings in ""Kill Bill"" were, at least they had a ""point"". In this movie, the violence was so gratuitous, so disturbing, it was like the director was suffering from schizophrenia, let's start like a comedy, then evolves into an action film, and finish it as a thriller a la ""Dark Knight"" ...<br/><br/>Yes, violence should have a point. I have nothing against ultra-violence in movies as long as it serves a purpose. In this movie, it was some kind of dangerously influential, flashy and over-the-top violence ... is it cool to show a 11 year old, brainwashed by a fascist Daddy, cutting off a man's legs AND finding it delightful, is it entertaining ? were they ""bad guys"" enough to be killed in such a merciless way? The movie became what it was trying to criticize in the beginning (in a very clever way) a superhero film, trying to be unique by mixing genres at a point I didn't even know how I was suppose to take the character, as Hancock or Bruce Wayne? I thought the gags were the best parts of the film ... and there were a few of them, mostly in the beginning (when it wasn't funny, I lost the interest and didn't care enough for the characters, it became monotonous)<br/><br/>I also have nothing against genre bending, as long as it looks like a natural progression, not something thrown like this just for shocking value. The movie was just an excuse to mix between current bankable movie genres, teen comedies (well, the comedy deserted the movie after the first half-hour) action films and dark thrillers ... I didn't even take the movie as a parody, and I'm not sure the movie was supposed to be one. It used the same codes as a superhero flick in an very exaggerated way, and I would have found that funny, if the scenes were actually funny and I don't think they were. I didn't find the knife-stabbing funny, I didn't think it was a bad scene either, I felt sorry for the character and thought it was one of the most 'shockingly intelligent' moment from the film. There were too many ""serious"" scenes in ""Kick-Ass"" for me, to label it as a parody. The only thing ""original"" was the genre-binding, but it was so artificial I didn't get what the director was trying to prove : normal people can be superheroes? no, they can't because real-life violence is not like in the comic books? no, actually, violence can be very fun and delightful if you're skilled and get the right weapons? <br/><br/>I don't get what's so great with watching a 11-old-year girl, dress her like a 'Manga' schoolgirl (something clearly borrowed from ""Kill Bil""l) and let her kill the bad guys in the most gruesome way (whatever crime they committed, we're supposed to believe they have deserved it) with the ultimate insult : a classic Western Spaghetti score ... how unoriginal and distasteful. Violence is not cool, and is not supposed to be cool, and the greatest movies about violence, at one point showed its ugliness : ""Bonnie and Clyde"", ""Pulp Fiction"", ""The Dirty Dozen"", ""The Wild Bunch"", it's even insulting to mention these films in this review.<br/><br/>""Kick-Ass"", a flashy, dangerous, meaningless movie, symptomatic of what is wrong with film-making today ..."

","At first when I glanced at IMDbs page for Kick-ass, I saw the numbers 8.1 staring back at me. I was in shock. This was by far the worst movie I've seen in my entire life. I've seen quite a lot of movies (In my own opinion he he, well well) and me being so out of line with the rest of the peoples opinions?! I created this account just to vote down this movie, it has an extremely over rated criticism on this site. Actually I saw a fellow IMDber write the exact same thing, that made it a little better. Well lets come to the point: At first, quite okay concept, just another superhero movie, was my thought when I saw the trailer. It starts with the main character having a normal teenage life but an urge to do something about todays far to great violence. Some funny scenes in the beginning and I was pleased and expected a quite okay film. But then the hell brake loose! Nicolas Cage and his little in-film-daughter appears with the worst dialog ever. Trying-to-be-funny lines from the little girl, with some strained laughs from Nicolas. Our main character the Oh so cool superhero feels that he needs to quit and focus on his new girlfriend (good commitment there). Everything from here is blood and violence and disgusting misplaced sex scenes. Mostly violence and blood of course, legs chopped off, heads exploding etc. I was 1 second away from turning off the movie, but I wanted to see the end even though the quality of this poor movie.<br/><br/>The end was ridiculously bad with some hardcore machine gun and bazooka action. The action scenes, the plot, the idea, the dialog, the movie was horrifying, and Im amazed that Nicolas Cage did say yes to this, even though he hasn't been the greatest role-chooser, this was by far his worst appearance ever. Well don't waste your time watching it, you will just feel a need to express your anger over the quality in this film - like me."

I lost interest towards the end, and was glad when it was over, as the finale was silly and violent, a bad combination.<br/><br/>That this movie is in the top 250 is an insult to intelligence, it really is becoming the world of Idiocracy (look up that movie).<br/><br/>I wouldn't recommend the movie, simply because the movie does not work as a feature film. Some short bits with Hit-Girl would be alright, or a short YouTube video would be acceptable, but as an almost two hour film, it simply does not hold together. And thank you once again Nicolas Cage, for totally stinking up the scenes you were in. How can this guy get several movies a year? Idiocracy indeed."

Obviously, I had to see what the hype was all about but I was also careful not to keep my expectations too high so that I wouldn't be disappointed. Guess what, I was disappointed.<br/><br/>Now, I wasn't expecting an intriguing deep psychological movie or anything. I wanted to see a fun 'popcorn' movie with exciting action scenes and a nice portion of good humour. But the movie failed to deliver this for quite a few reasons. Firstly, even though there were some funny moments, a lot of the humour was based on swearing and sexual references (surprise, surprise). However, the humour itself is on short supply as a lot of the movie is wasted on drama and sappiness, something a popcorn movie should not have more than a few minutes of. Plus, the violence is a little too gruesome to actually fit into a fun movie. Just put the equation together and think about what we have here. I'll use 'Hit-girl' as an example. A strong little girl who constantly swears and takes part in all kinds of messed up violence, but also manages to have a sappy, dramatic history. Awww... how cute... NOT. Perhaps the movie should be named 'Hit-girl', because other than the fact that 'Kick-ass' is narrating and is simply in more scenes than her, there is nothing to insinuate that he is the main character. 'Hit-girl' had a much more important role in the story. But anyways, none of the characters are really likable, there way too much use of loud music in the a lot of the scenes, and nothing in particular sticks out about the whole film.<br/><br/>This movie did not live up to my expectations, let alone the hype. It did keep me entertained, but not in a mind blowing way. Even though the story gave the movie some potential, it turned out to be pretty average."

The acting is not too shabby either, though none of the characters are captured spot-on.<br/><br/>If not for the writers, this could have been an awesome movie interpretation of an awesome comic book. The story is almost completely rewritten, resulting in a mediocre storyline with elements of the plot forced into it during 3 minute intervals.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, and if you haven't read the comic book, definitely read it after watching the film.

"fantasyescapist","Null","3","10","6 April 2010"," Fun action comedy with an everyday teen nerd becoming a masked vigilante
","Already this year, I've see a candidate for not just the best comic-book film of 2010 but the most entertaining one. <br/><br/>Acting: Aaron Johnson, who plays the eponymous Kick-Ass is likable as an everyday nerd(and pulls off an American accent well - something Sam Worthington never could even if his life depended on it), Nicholas Cage delivers his lines with an intentional deadpan, soap-opera staccato that's quite humorous in places, Mark Strong(who seems to be continuously cast as villains) is really good and brutal as a drug lord, Christopher Mintz-Plasse is amusing as Red Mist, with a high-pitched voice but the person that steals the scenes is Hit Girl. <br/><br/>Chloë Moretz plays her character as a precocious, resourceful, foul-mouthed (when she niftily dispatching her victims) and basically a kid assassin with attitude. Her incongruous behaviour(for her age) stems from this being a comic-book film, so she's wholly from a skewed version of reality, therefore should not cause any offence to informed individuals who understand this.<br/><br/>Plot: There is a clear homage to Spider-Man here, plot-wise, but it's subversive in how it plays out, despite the familiar elements. It also works on different levels: a social commentary(on passive bystanders of crime), instant celebrity, responsibility, vengeance and as a entertaining action comedy. There's all sorts of in-jokes with references to comic-books here (as well as telly, film and video games), with a very tongue in cheek tone(with even serious scenes having some laughs from characters making amusing comments). I would've liked to see scenes where characters suffered the consequences of being injured more, but to a certain extent, it's cartoony style(that doesn't linger too long on bloody violence) works for it's tone it's going for. <br/><br/>Cinematography and SFX: A colourfully pleasing look, with a dynamic, fast-paced style of choreographed violence that is rapidly edited and focuses more on the inventive skill of the heroes. I loved the 3D-looking animated comic book strip.<br/><br/>There's a video-game inspired action (FPS influenced in one scene in particular) that are easier to follow than any Bay-directed action sequence. Those prone to photosensitive epilepsy should note a brief strobe lighting sequence. <br/><br/>Score: The title song by Mika is an empowering, catchy pop song that captures the drive of the masked vigilantes in the film. Others songs used fittingly to create the right tone this film's going for - lively and no-nonsense. The score uses recognisable tracks from Sunshine and 28 Days Later.<br/><br/>Overall: Like giving the middle-finger to conformity, Kick-Ass wears it's punk rock tone proudly, and addresses the dangers of playing dress up to fight crime while acknowledging the reasons such people could have for doing so. While I'm not inspired to become a masked vigilante anytime soon(the occupational hazard is just too high :D), I was very entertained by this and surprisingly even my middle-aged Mum(who the Daily Mail though would be enraged by such rebellion) loved it. A cool, moderately humorous experience indeed and a definite must-see at a cinema near you as it does exactly what it says on the tin and delivers it with panache - 7.5/10"

""Superbad"" directed by Quentin Tarantino could've easily been the pitch for this radically, graphic adaptation of the graphic novel series by Marvel Comics' Mark Millar & John Romita Jr. (who collaborated on the screenplay with Jane Goldman and the film's director Matthew Vaughn) which is a unique spin on the comic book genre to say the least. Gawky, teenager geek Dave Lizewski (newbie Johnson in an amiable turn) decides to take up his own ""What If Ordinary People Who Indulge in SuperHero Comics Actually Decided to Become One"" scenario, kicking it up a notch as a self-made vigilante in NYC but faces some serious consequences (i.e. pain inflicted really does hurt!) Also up for some titular tête-à-tête (and personal vengeance vendetta) are ""Big Daddy"" and ""Hit-Girl"" (Cage having a field day as an ex-cop/""Batman"" manqué and newcomer Moretz who truly steals the film as the whirling dervish combo of The Tasmanian Devil and The Joker with her half-pint stature clearly a perfect foil for her homicidal tendencies with deft aplomb and filthy language to boot; her gauntlet run at the film's climax is truly one for the film vault and worth the price of admission). Stunning, blackly funny and shocking to say the least, but damn entertaining as well. For the kiddies? NO. For those grown-up kiddies: HellzYeah!! One of the year's best and one of the best comic book adaptations to date. Revisionist to say the least!"

"imdbbl","Null","3","11","11 May 2010"," Not worthy of all the buzz
","This film tells the story of an ordinary teenager, Dave Lizewski, who sets out to become a real-life superhero calling himself Kick-Ass. Dave gets caught up in a bigger fight when he meets Big Daddy, a former cop who, in his quest to bring down the evil drug lord Frank D'Amico, has trained his eleven-year-old daughter to be the ruthless vigilante Hit-Girl.Whenever there's a lot of hype an buzz around a film, I always tend to be suspicious. When there's so much talk about a film before its release, that is usually due to extensive marketing and publicity by the studios and not an indicator of the film's quality. In fact, most of the time, a lot of hype means a shallow and low quality Hollywood blockbuster (i.e. Avatar).<br/><br/>And that's precisely the case with Kick-Ass. A somewhat entertaining film but at the same time extremely flawed.Despite an original premise, the story couldn't be more predictable,it's almost insulting in fact. The dialog isn't that great either and most characters are caricatures.There's also an awful lot of over-acting. As a comedy the film fails miserably, most of the jokes are incredibly plain, simple and above all, very, very silly and it doesn't help that the film shifts tones constantly. What's to enjoy? A few well done action scenes and some of the interactions between Hit-Girl and her father.<br/><br/>I'm sure some people will be offended by the strong language used by Hit Girl, after all the actress playing the part was only 11 years old at the time Kick-Ass was being filmed but to be honest, I don't think anything she said is too offensive. In conclusion, the film is decent enough to be watched until the end but I think it is a very poor effort and a film you should probably skip. Definitely not worthy of all the buzz.<br/><br/>6/10"
"agsconnolly","7","3","11","12 April 2010"," Enjoyable, but lacks balance
","For a film that has received so many rave reviews and seems to appeal to varying audiences, I was surprised I didn't like Kick-Ass more. It has comedy, drama, action and some great visuals, but it feels that there is not enough of a balance struck between these aspects to make the film truly excel.<br/><br/>Still, it is fun and pretty enjoyable. The story concerns an average kid (Aaron Johnson) attempting to become a superhero with no idea how to achieve this and the ensuing adventures that take in a notorious mobster, his son and two genuine superheroes, amongst others. The film is angled as a kind of black comedy superhero caper, which is admittedly original, but it seems to compromise on the comedy which doesn't really suit the film's premise. At times, the drama is far too overbearing and serious for a film concerning a bungling superhero.<br/><br/>On the subject of the comedy, one feels it relies too much on shocking visual moments than on sharp scripting - the amusing casual banter in the vein of Superbad etc. that you might expect is not strong enough and the film never delivers the one-liner laughs that it intends or threatens to. Many of the laughs come from Hit-Girl, a school-age superhero who has been trained by her father, Nicolas Cage, in the arts of self-defence and weaponry. Her foul-mouthed and ultra-violent killing sprees are funny and impressively showcased, but one feels too much emphasis is placed on the Hit-Girl 'shock factor' at times.<br/><br/>The reason given for Hit-Girl and Big Daddy (Cage's super alter-ego) becoming superheroes is flimsy at best, and a rather odd scene where their crime-fighting is blamed on Cage's character being framed in the past and his wife dying while he served the resulting jail sentence is a fairly lazy and unoriginal plot device which doesn't add the spice it perhaps could. Speaking of lazy plot devices, we are subjected to a pretty lame, slow-burning love interest for Johnson's character which doesn't really add much and, if anything, implodes the idea that he is a talentless loser, one of the main aspects of the basic story.<br/><br/>It's not that Kick-Ass is a bad film - it's actually entertaining for the most part and certainly not formulaic or predictable. And whilst it's somewhat of a letdown on the comedy front, it's not unfunny. And the action and visuals are as good as they could be. It just seems to lose its way between trying to be a gross-out teen comedy and a dark, violent comic book thriller. At times this makes it pretty uncomfortable to watch, which one feels is unnecessary for something so apparently light-hearted.<br/><br/>Still, there's a lot here for audiences to enjoy - albeit more for the Kill Bill/Sin City crowds than the more general audience at which it appears to be aimed."
"Bunuel1976","8","3","11","10 April 2010"," KICK-ASS (Matthew Vaughn, 2010) ***1/2
","If not for the high recommendation from a Maltese film-buff friend of mine a couple of days ago, I would probably have skipped an immediate viewing of this unheralded gem of a comic-strip spoof at the local cinema and waited for it to become available as a DVD rental; for the record, that same guy had loathed Zach Snyder's epic superhero movie WATCHMEN (2009) which I had really dug myself only recently...so, even if I decided to follow his advice, I had my reservations on just how right he could be! <br/><br/>Needless to say, judging by my uncharacteristically high rating for a contemporary genre film, my final verdict on KICK-ASS was in complete agreement with the latter's – who, incidentally, had also opined that ""Quentin Tarantino would turn green with envy when he watches this""! Again, his comments were absolutely spot-on because here we also have a movie that is at once informed by – as well as being an analysis of – pop culture: naturally, in this case, the superhero/comic-strip phenomenon. But while in Tarantino's movies such wordy diatribes come off as vain show-offs by its fanboy writer-director by having them incongruously uttered by professional hit men or attractive chicks, in KICK-ASS they sound perfectly natural because it is nerdy schoolboys who deliver this kind of dialogue! Another Tarantinoesque trademark lifted wholesale (and utilized well) is the presence of an eclectic soundtrack, since throughout this movie we are treated to samples from Ennio Morricone's ""For A Few Dollars More"", ""The Banana Splits"" (one of my favorite TV shows from my long-gone childhood days!) and even the music playing over the opening credits of the ""Masters Of Horror"" TV-series. <br/><br/>Anyway, the men behind this brilliantly disarming piece of entertainment were also fairly unknown to me: original source writer Mark Millar had already been the creator of WANTED (2008) and director Matthew Vaughn had made the British crime thriller LAYER CAKE (2004; starring a pre-James Bond Daniel Craig) and STARDUST (2007; with Robert De Niro, Peter O'Toole, etc.); for what it is worth, I intend to track them all down in the coming days. Equally unknown and impressive was the young cast: Aaron Johnson (a Keith Gordon lookalike) is Kick-ass, 12-year old Chloe Moretz (soon to be seen in Matt Reeves' Hollywood remake of 2008's Swedish horror revelation LET THE RIGHT ONE IN) practically steals the show as the foul-mouthed, ass-kicking ""Hit-Girl""; Lyndsy Fonseca is the lovely object of desire quietly lusted after by Kick-ass' geeky everyday alter-ego (and whom he only manages to hook up with by falsely ""coming out""!), Mark Strong (as the town's leading mobster Frank D'Amico) and Chistopher Mintz-Plasse (as his overprotected kid who ingeniously lures Kick-ass into a deadly trap by dressing up as rival superhero ""Red Mist""). The film also manages to accomplish a near-superhuman feat all of its own when it made me like Nicolas Cage as ""Big Daddy"" – Moretz' father and the one bona-fide article in the superhero stakes; Cage, an avowed comic-strip fan in real-life, had already appeared in the ludicrous GHOST RIDER (2007) next to Eva Mendeswith whom he has just appeared again in Werner Herzog's 2009 remake of THE BAD LIEUTENANT: PORT OF CALL – NEW ORLEANS which, it goes without saying, I want to check out despite its dubious intent!<br/><br/>While the single biggest laugh-out-loud moment in KICK-ASS for me comes at the very start of the film (with the ill-fated flight of another false 'superhero') and the sequel-inviting ending seemed somewhat misjudged – I would much rather have had the kid commit hara-kiri when he found the samurai sword, leaving the film to be a veritable one-off oddity – it is the sheerly audacious political incorrectness (having the young Moretz spitting four-letter words and hack limbs left, right and center, not to mention being punched in the face and thrown around rooms herself!) that arguably makes KICK-ASS the coolest and most enjoyable superhero movie ever made! Hell, if this attitude catches on, now might make it the right time for me (and my twin brother) to unleash our own decade-old 'objectionable' script onto a more open-minded world..."

","Early in the story Kick-Ass does a good job of illustrating what would really happen if someone decided to be a superhero (i.e., lots of pain). Later it becomes increasingly clear that this is itself a superhero movie, and has begun playing by superhero-movie rules. Physics and happenstance conspire with increasing frequency in favor of the good guys, rendering the movie's original premise--why doesn't anyone really do this, and what would happen if they did--once again meaningless.<br/><br/>Kick-Ass is funny, well-written and suspenseful throughout, though--just in different ways as the story turns. Hit-Girl is brilliant creation who forsakes all little-girl things in favor of her paramilitary training, jumps impossibly across all surfaces, and treats her enemies like fillets in a Japanese restaurant. But although she and Kick-Ass often have the amazing luck of Hollywood, be warned that they can get hurt.<br/><br/>Why you should see it You're a superhero geek. You like action movies. You've been trying for years to get up the nerve to get that costume out of its hiding place in the attic and go fight some evil. Or at least start your training at the local gym.<br/><br/>Why you should avoid it Cursing of any kind makes you say, ""oh, my goodness!,"" so hearing a 13-year-old girl using the ""f"" word would probably make you say, ""oh, my! What kind of movie is this?!?,"" turn red and run from the room.<br/><br/>--from my review at www.1man365movies.com"
"itamarscomix","6","2","6","23 September 2011"," Cynical and far too easy to misunderstand
","Kick-Ass attempts to cynically deconstruct the superhero genre, and at that level it doesn't quite make it for me. Watchmen - clearly the graphic novel, but the movie too - did so much more intelligently. The sarcastic, tongue-in-cheek attitude with which the gruesome violence is shown fails to make it any less gruesome, and is all too easily taken at face value, especially by younger viewers, thus missing completely the point Vaughn was trying to make.<br/><br/>On the entertainment and style fronts, Kick-Ass is more successful, and it manages to create a truly fresh cinematic superhero look, a more colorful contrast to The Dark Knight's gritty realism. The acting for the most part is mediocre at best, except for the wonderful Chloe Moretz as Hit Girl and Nicolas Cage - who hasn't been this good in a long time - as bad-ass vigilante Big Daddy. It doesn't really matter though, because Kick-Ass is all about style and action scenes; the dialog-based scenes are weak and dull enough as they are, filling up the gaps in-between coolness. For comics and superhero fans, including ex-fans who long ago dropped their interest in the costumed vigilantes, this is a great piece of entertainment, but not a whole lot more."

","Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) is an unnoticed high school student and comic book fan who one day decides to become a super-hero, even though he has no powers, training or meaningful reason to do so.<br/><br/>Shortest review I ever wrote: Lyndsy Fonseca was great as Katie Deauxma, and I would like to see more of her. Clark Duke is already overexposed (between this film and ""Hot Tub Time Machine""). Please stop casting him, he is not the next Jonah Hill.<br/><br/>Chloe Moretz is the best young actress in the business today, and while I already knew that years ago, films like this one and ""Let Me In"" are proving it. If you need a young actress and Dakota Fanning is too old, go Chloe Moretz. I do not care what Roger Ebert says about the violence, this film is great."

"tpaladino","9","2","6","16 May 2011"," This movie was GREAT.
","I saw this movie come up on my Netflix On Demand 'recommended' list, and thought I'd give it a shot. Of course, I had already heard all about it and was definitely curious to see what all the hype was about, and although I do enjoy the genre in general, I was certainly not expecting to love this movie as much as I did. In fact, one might say that I was shocked at how much I enjoyed it. <br/><br/>Yes, I know it's wrong to see an eleven year old girl gleefully dismember bad guys. Yes, I know that vigilantism is nothing to advocate. And yes, I also know that if an average high school nerd put on a pair of tights and decided to fight crime, he'd likely end up dead. <br/><br/>I can happily put all those concerns aside though, because the fact is that this is a tremendously well made film with a solid plot and characters you genuinely care about. The acting is superb, particularly by young Chloe Moretz who is surely a superstar in the making. The director obviously had a very clear vision of what he wanted this movie to be, and he hit a home run in execution. <br/><br/>If I had to pick out something that I didn't like, it would be that most of the street scenes which are supposed to be New York City are pretty obviously not (as a native New Yorker this annoys me quite a bit)... I realize this was likely a budget issue, but its still something noticeable. The only other thing I would possibly complain about is that I feel the jetpack/gatling gun gadget that Kick Ass used in the end was just a tiny bit too much... I think they could have accomplished that scene a little better. But honestly, these are very minor flaws in an otherwise outstanding film. <br/><br/>Yes, it's not a movie for everyone, and there are going to be many people who aren't going to be able to get past the imagery of a tarted-up preteen girl brutally killing criminals while making profane wisecracks. And that's fine... I totally understand where they're coming from. But if you can briefly suspend your own sense of reality for a couple of hours, you're sure to enjoy it."

","bought this movie at the video store and finally sat down to watching it one evening and was pleasantly surprised by how much i enjoyed this film. i usually have reservations about graphic novels being adapted for the big-screen but after seeing the trailer several times, decided to give it a go. while the trailer looks like a movie for kids, it is definitely not for kids due to the excessive amount of violence and coarse language spoken by the young adult stars. i do agree with one reviewer who said that the actress who plays the role of hit-girl steals almost every scene she is in. this is evident when she appears on screen during the apartment massacre and saves kick ass's life by single-handedly wiping out all the villains with her kung-fu style moves and and expert weaponry skills. a very cool scene with great background music to match. while nicholas cage didn't have a major role in the film i still liked his character 'big daddy'. you really get to see how he got into the business of becoming a superhero and vigilante of sorts through a comic book he created and how got his daughter involved. i loved his costume which greatly resembled batman's. i didn't get too into the character of kick ass who i thought was a wannabe superhero and hanger on. he didn't possess any physical abilities or hand to hand combat skills which is evident as he tries to fight off goons and thugs who cross his path. he doesn't have any specially made weapons or gadgets except for his two batons that he uses to beat up on criminals. his character was wimpy and kind of pathetic at times that i found it hard to sympathize with him. red mist was just okay as he was never a superhero but used as bait to lure kick-ass to the secret lair of hit-girl and big daddy and expose them as the real culprits behind all the slayings of the drug-lords in town. he had a pretty cool costume and drove a car that reminded me of the bat mobile. over-all i enjoyed the many action/fightings sequences which were excellently done. some witty and sharp dialogue and solid script. recommended to anyone looking for a good time and fun ride."
"dudedazzreviews","9","2","6","10 October 2010"," Kick-Ass kicks ass (sorry but it does)
","What can I say, Kick-Ass was just absolutely fantastic and such a brilliant experience. The story was brilliantly written and very clever. The actors were fantastic and they really brought their characters to life, especially Chloe Grace Moretz who played the awesome 11-year-old superhero Hit Girl who probably had the most violent scenes in the movie and used the most bad language too. Aaron Johnson, who plays the main character Kick-Ass, was brilliant and he played his character about an ordinary teenager wanting to be a superhero, cleaning the streets from crime brilliantly. The direction was done very well and the cinematography was outstanding, the action scenes were fantastically executed and the script was very cleverly written. Kick-Ass isn't really one of those comedy movies where you laugh a lot, actually you'd be surprised of how dark it really is. It's a dark comedy and it's guaranteed that you'll enjoy it.<br/><br/>Since seeing the trailer for this movie in January, this was one of the movies I really wanted to see this year. Kick-Ass manages to smash all expectations to smithereens and manages to be original and not fall into the been-there-done-that superhero movies we normally see today. Kick-Ass was a roller-coaster made to draw you into the movie, leaving you with a grin on your face.

I really didn't want to see the bad guy get nuked.<br/><br/>I do have an issue with gratuitous violence in movies such as ""Natural Born Killers"" which was mentioned in other reviews. I found that film quite disturbing because the good are corrupt and the bad get away with everything. It has a completely different atmosphere compared to this film which is just plain fun and in the end good wins over evil.<br/><br/>I do agree that it would have been possible to make this movie just as effective without as much graphic violence but I'm not willing to pan it because of that. Hit Girl has her head square on her shoulders! (as does my daughter, which is why she could watch it without any undue distress) This movie is in the league of ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off""....one of those gems that you can watch over and over again as the years pass...

"webmaster-3017","8","2","6","23 August 2010"," HK Neo Reviews: Kiss-Ass
","A fresh and innovative take on comic book heroes...<br/><br/>Comic Book heroes can be fun and Kick-Ass delivers because it is fun. Without any superpowers, can you be a super hero. The answer to this movie is yes, but on the way to the top, you need a car accident, meet some real life superheroes and some fancy gadgets, then you are almost there. Still, the movie plays with the audience's mind. I am sure, that a majority of you that grown up watching comic book heroes, dreamt of the day – saving the world, killing bad guys and getting the girl across the horizon near the sunset. Such is the simplicity and fun that Kick-Ass generates. They are pretentious, but rather director Matthew Vaughn, combines sleek action, colourful characters, witty dialogue and even a tone of emotional core and in return creating a kick-ass of a movie.<br/><br/>Aaron Johnson plays the lead role of an ordinary high schooler, who longs and dreams of one day being a superhero. He is a likable character that never seems over the top. While, it may well be unintentional, I believe that his comic timing is spot on. One scene that catches the eye is when he confesses to the girl of his dreams (played by Lyndsy Fonseca). Nicholas Cage plays a supporting role as the father and a real life superhero, avenging the death of his wife. Sounds cliché, but his character is nothing but cliché. Cage makes his character mysterious and despite the violence that he preaches, one can imagine that only Cage can pull off such a character. However, the highlight of the whole extravagant must be the emergence of Chloe Grace Moretz (the wise kid from 500 Days of Summer). Chloe easily plays a character beyond her age and whether her moves are effects or stunts enhanced or not, she is the highlight of the movie. In one scene, when she entered the evil corporation with a school uniform, it reminds me of Kill Bill. There is no doubt that this kid have potential and rarely can killing one person after another still equates plenty of fun.<br/><br/>All in all, Kick-Ass is a great movie. For all it is worth, I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of the ride. It is light-hearted, fun, bloody, realistic, bombastic and finally true to the blue of comic books. There is even can allusion to John Woo in a question that Cage asks his daughter, but even without that line, the famous 2 handed gun sequences is already Woo enough. Kick-Ass is a kind of movie that you either like it or hate it and luckily, I am the latter. Maybe, I also dream about being a superhero, but till that day, Kick-Ass works for me...(Neo 2010) <br/><br/>I rate it 8/10<br/><br/><ul><li>www.thehkneo.com</li></ul>"

","Many people mention that Kill Bill by Quentin Tarantino was largely inspired by Lady Snowblood, the 1973 Japanese revenge movie directed by Toshiya Fujita and starring Meiko Kaji. The sub-plot in Kick Ass (Big Daddy/Hit Girl story) is much closer to Lady Snowblood than Kill Bill is, except that the female assassin is much younger and more foul-mouthed.<br/><br/>Having watched quite a few of these Japanese revenge-themed movies from the 70s of late I think I've developed an appreciation of the genre. Kick Ass fits in nicely, and the acting is superb. I hope Chloe Moretz goes on to do as well as Meiko Kaji did.<br/><br/>The main plot in Kick Ass has a lot of depth, touching on many contemporary issues such as apathy, gay-bashing and school-yard bullying under the guise of a coming-of-age story. I see more in it every time I watch it (which has been quite a few times already). Aaron Johnson does a great job with the role, struggling with all the moral and personal issues that the movie raises.<br/><br/>Some have criticised the movie for not fitting into any genre, but I see it as being post-modern in it's breaking out of genres and reflecting on them in a way that transcends rather than satirizes."
"odeeznuts","8","2","6","17 August 2010"," engaging... and substantial!
","Kick-ass is one of those movies that has its tongue so firmly panted in cheek because of the years of video archives where superheroes were altruistic. Also, because of this fact, they are able to find the perfect cast to pull it off. The characters are interesting while also being somewhat stock. The nerd becomes superhero, the crime boss bad guy with lots of guns. His underwhelming son who wants more. The mentor hell bent on revenge and the protégé turned into the perfect weapon who never has questions because she finds herself protected from them by love. Its not the situations or the characters that mainly draw us in. Its the little nuances that they have managed to fit into the story without making it seem weighed down or unfocused. At one point kick-ass is using some heavy machinery and you ask why at first, but then u realize that its not a bad fit. Its just a fit. Everything seems to fit in the film. In one case you have the high school life, but then you have a very real life outside of the school. This is where kick-ass ventures into often with hilarious results and sometimes very real and intense results. When he is looking for the cat, priceless! And when he fights its comical but also seems very brave of him. He upholds the altruism of the classic superhero but he doesn't have the talent to beat his enemies if they decide not to listen. U never really feel sorry for him tho because he does tend to be somewhat lucky getting caught in the middle of a war between an entire crime syndicate and a father and daughter with lethal accuracy. If he has any powers whatsoever the power of being lucky would be it. The thing about this movie is after watching it I feel very entertained and not patronized. The movie just told itself. It didn't try to find solace in things. It didn't try to make u feel good. There's no way you can be 100 % comfortable with an 11 year old girl going through what she goes through in the story. And cage's character was very damaged. Its pretty clear what his intentions are and they sure are not altruistic. It was executed pretty much perfectly. Its larger than life but remains grounded. The crime syndicate doesn't overstep its dramatic bounds. Its the right amount of ineptitude and ruthlessness that makes them so real. Then we have a little girl killing them with great ease. One might say that takes away from the realness. But thats not true. Its believable that she can do such things. What they have accomplished is fleshing out a fantasy in a very mundane and dangerous world. The hero gets hurt, a lot, in this world, but thats what makes him so interesting, its what makes them all so interesting, that they are weak and they pretend to be strong. Most comic book heroes are strong but pretend to be weak. A hero without any threats is boring. If superman had no kryptonite there would nothing to stop him from boring the crap out of us. The more weaknesses the more interesting. Kick-ass may be the most interesting man in the world in that case. I had to give an 8. It was good and thought provoking, but it didn't blow me away."
"quej","8","2","6","29 June 2010"," VERY Entertaining but not for the kids
","This film is very entertaining. Nicholas Cage is brilliant as the burnt out, mad at the system, mad at life, mad at the bad guy typical (in my view) gun toting American Dad who is bringing his daughter up to be the all new slightly disturbed female RAMBO. Cloe Moretz defies her age by putting in a very adult performance as a not too slightly twisted young HitGirl. It should really worry her parents that she could make the role so believable. Aaron Johnson also plays a great role as the lead and managed to make me both want to punch him and also want him to succeed so much. Finally, what can I say about Lyndsy Fonseca.... That girl is so hot, I heard the rest of the cast suffered third degree burns when ever they performed with her.<br/><br/>The film does fall a little into the typical American ""Boy meets girl who is so far out of his league. Boy does something really great. Super sexy girl suddenly falls totally in love with geeky boy"" etc etc etc. That though is the only flaw I would tag the film with. It is entertaining, fast paced, full of action, explosion, bad guys, henchman, more explosions, blood, guts, legs being removed, more explosions and lots and lots of tongue in cheek comedy.<br/><br/>Definitely a recommended watch. Even if it's just to see Lyndsy Fonseca in just her undies.....I'm in love"
"GodBug","8","2","6","29 June 2010"," Confusingly watchable
","This is a good (non-)superhero movie. It mixes action, drama and comedy in an interesting way. Extremely interesting.<br/><br/>Our hero isn't a hero, but he wants to be. So he becomes one, but not really. Or does he? Revolving around the point of being a hero the movie brings some confusion. It starts with a noble message, but loses it towards the end. First it wants to show itself in a realistic light, but because of that tone you are just more struck about the violence in the movie. At some points it's just cruel.<br/><br/>So it leans more and more on the superhero concept throughout the movie - good guys versus bad guys, extreme mindless action, it even features a painstaking cliffhanger.<br/><br/>Another thing that bothered me is the love interest. This isn't a spoiler as it seems that every single movie nowadays needs a lil' bit of love. OK, there's nothing wrong with being in love, but the way it develops in the film ... Let's just say it's a bit rash.<br/><br/>Despite writing all of the above the movie is still great to watch. It's no masterpiece, but it's an interesting mix of various ingredients (and other movies) - one minute you'll be excited about the action, the other you'll have something to think about, you'll have a few moments to form a smile and there might even be a few minutes where you'll be scared."
"bennyhagen","7","2","6","10 June 2010"," Almost there
","Thanks to it's unique atmosphere, good pacing, the delightful cast and the almost fantastic fact, that Kick-Ass absolutely has the balls to push the envelope as it is not desperately craving for ratings and family friendliness, like - you could expect from a mainstream movie - This is one of the most charming, enjoyable and entertaining movies I've seen this year.<br/><br/>But. Having all this together, the possibilities would have been at least to make one of the the most original movies in this genre ever, an opportunity that Matthew Vaughn decides to miss. The startup is hilarious and keeping up that tendency probably would have got this movie into history, but at a certain point, it takes a different direction where people (let me quote) ""...have the expensive s*** that does not exist..."" and the 11 year old girl's beating up crowds of ripped crack dealers and professional criminals with ease. Which - after setting up its own rules to not do exatly that - was a major letdown for me. Also Kick-Ass occasionally suffers from some seriously bad dialog. Watching it the second time around, without awaiting a wonder, I liked it more though and by the way, the comic book narrative is really well executed.<br/><br/>Bring on the sequel, but please, without prostituting the whole thing to do better at the box office.<br/><br/>7/10"

","Well...where do I start with Kick Ass? From start to finish I had the biggest smile on my face! Not roll on the floor, side splitting funny. Just lots of very clever bits and lines that kept me smiling from ear to ear throughout. From the Kleenex line to Nicolas Cages awesome Adam West take off (for those of your that are old enough to remember him!) My jaws hurt every time he spoke! I'm not a huge fan of ""McLovin"" (he will always be that to me!) but he was cast perfectly for this role.<br/><br/>The guy who played Kick ass, was simply brilliant. He almost had me fooled as an American - great accent and tone used throughout the film, very convincing considering he's very, very English! (Far, far better than Hugh Laurie in House) And now to the star of the Show...Hit Girl! This film will do so much for this young actresses career, and I can't wait to see her in other roles.<br/><br/>All in all I give this awesome film 9/10. Casting, filming, storyline, Acting/ OST 10/10! THE MARKETING FOR THIS FILM 3/10 - That's why I had to knock it down to 9/10 The marketing for this film was truly sh!te, knowbody knows about it!

"ajr-91106","10","1","2","4 December 2019"," Favourite film of all time
","From the opening scene to the credits, Kick-Ass is almost a perfect movie. The three aspects which make it so good are the characters, the action and the score. The opening scene introduces us to both the main character and the tone that the rest of the film has. Consistently throughout, every scene is charming and funny, while still being serious. But when it does get dark, for example big daddy's death, it hits hard. This is because Hit girl and Big daddy's relationship is very realistic and charming to watch, making Big daddy's death even sadder. Every character is loveable, even the bad guys. What adds to the already great film, is the fight scenes. Vaughn has used the R rating to the max in this one, which is great. Every fight scene contains brutal or over-the-top violence and gore, but is toned down by the light-heartedness of the film, which mix together perfectly. The film has, no doubt a perfect score and soundtrack as well. The songs played during the action scenes are fast-paced and fit perfectly, making the scene/s awesome to watch, and the film's beautiful theme plays during any charming or epic moments. I think the catalyst for this movie being so good is the setting and story. The film feels very nostalgic to Raimi's original Spiderman, as both films are about a nerdy teenager wanting to get with a girl, and set in a suberban town, making it relatable to the audience. However, why this movie is more relatable than Spider-Man is that Kick-Ass doesn't have powers, so the whole movie could happen in real life. The whole movie is perfectly paced, there is literally not a second that is boring and the direction and editing is also perfect. It is not overly dark and gritty like Watchmen, but not overly comedic lie Superhero Movie, it just manages to find a spot right in the middle. The writing is full of pop-culture references, hilarious lines and deep quotes. Overall, Kick-Ass is probably the best superhero film ever made and deserves so much more attention than it has. It is 2 hours of non-stop entertainment. 10/10"

","I really thought I'd like this movie more. I'd heard great things from enough people, superhero movies are my jam, especially when they take a different angle on the genre and the premise of this one is definitely fun.<br/><br/>It just didn't quite land for me. That and the end really dragged me down. The world had been set up as pretty normal, seemingly, until the end when they introduce something that is completely world breaking to me. That and Cage's character came off as a lot creepy to me. Important to note, I thought Cage was actually pretty good and played exactly what he was meant to, his performance was great but the character itself is just a bit ew. I can only hear him being called Big Daddy by a little girl so many times before it's just weird.<br/><br/>Anyhow, still an entertaining movie, it just shoots itself in the foot a bit, preventing it from being great."

","Sure, superhero genre is perfect for mocking. Yet, it should have some deeper purpose. Mocking just for the mocking is what you do with your friends in a bar or at a picnic. You can't have a worthwhile movie on that. That is, if you do make a worthwhile movie on that premise, you will get deeper an get a parody, which this is not.<br/><br/>There's very disturbing violence for no particular purpose. It's way worse than Kill Bill, which was a parody on Asian kung-fu movies. This obvious isn't parody at all, yet alone of Asian kung-fu.<br/><br/>The ""11 year old girl kills and beats dozens of skilled big men"" is also terrible. Again, worse than Kill Bill - at least Uma Thurman was a grown woman.<br/><br/>It's not very funny, has but a few good jokes and is obviously not very fun. My favorite is when the big fat black bad guy takes the bazooka and says ""I always wanted to say this: Say hello to my little friend!""... this is one of the best references to Al Pacino's Scarface I've seen.<br/><br/>It's not terrible as a whole as it has some redeeming qualities, but, it's not good.<br/><br/>The only reason to watch this movie is if you need convincing that superhero genre is terrible. But, if you watched any superhero movie beside the few good ones (Superman I & II, Batman I & II, Spiderman I and Iron Man I), you should know that already."

","The beginning of the movie is Quentin Tarantino does Napoleon Dynamite, without the annoying flashbacks, just annoying first person narration. The first person narration eventually goes away. A geek kid decides to become a superhero, and as in real life he doesn't get superhero results. When he is faced with certain death he is saved by an 11 year old girl in a mask(Hit Girl). This is a remarkable scene as the sound track plays the music from the Banana Splits. Yes, the sound track helped make the movie.<br/><br/>The initial scene with Nicolas Cage was also a great scene. In order to be a big hit, a movie needs a few great scenes and no bad scenes. I believe this film will be a cult classic. I thought the teen acting was all excellent except for the Red Mist. His bad acting was made up for by a sensational performance by Hit Girl (Dakota Fanning move over) who owned every scene she was in.<br/><br/>The nudity mentioned on the box must refer to the quick glimpse we get of ""National Geographic porno"" we see on the computer while our hero has his pants at his ankles. Frequent f-bomb."
"classicsoncall","4","1","2","23 February 2018"," ""Does anyone have any idea who this wet-suit crusader is?""
","OK, so what do the movies ""The Godfather"", ""Schindler's List"", ""Casablanca"" and ""Kick-Ass"" all have in common? I'll save you the effort - they were all on the IMDb list of Top 250 movies in 2010. Does anyone sense something wrong with this picture? Fortunately, that one appearance on a Top 250 list was all this film could muster, which tells me that viewers have returned to some semblance of rationality since this movie came out. I don't begrudge teenagers voting this movie up, but this just adds another reason to my oft repeated suggestion that perhaps new releases should have some sort of grace period before they enter the IMDb rating system. If a movie is any good, it will get the requisite number of votes to be considered for a top films list no matter when it was released, but the initial fanboy hysteria makes this kind of rush to judgment somewhat silly. In a more rational world, this one might even wind up on IMDb's Lowest Rated Movies List.<br/><br/>As for some intellectual type of review for this picture, in light of my opening statement, I think it would be a moot point. Lordy mama, this was just about the dumbest thing I've ever seen. Not altogether terrible if you're a comic book fan, but if you're over say, sixteen years old I think you really need to be moving on with your life. The only reason I finished watching was because I've vowed to see a movie to it's completion as the criteria for writing a review. But this one was a chore, believe me. At least I got a kick out of the film's best line, a take-off on Spider-Man's mission statement - ""With no power comes no responsibility"".<br/><br/>Along with the virtual no name cast (at least to me), I was stunned but not surprised to see Nicolas Cage take part in this effort. Making atrocious movies in recent years has become necessary for the actor because he just can't handle money, as attested by the fact that he's recently been foreclosed on any number of homes and private mansions. I hope the guy can clean up his messes so we don't have to witness another flick like the one Big Daddy appeared in."

Chloe Grace Moretz who played Hit Girl did an absolute sublime job with her acting and also fighting skills. Many critics disagreed with the fact a girl her age was acting in a film that contained scenes of violence and also swearing. However, I believe it's all about the experience and she can definitely used what she learned and pursue it in other films. The saddest moment in the movie was seeing the departure of Big Daddy. He definitely played a crucial part in Hit Girl's life which is why he was specifically remembered the most to me during the production.

","Kick-Ass (2010): Dir: Matthew Vaughan / Cast: Aaron Johnson, Chloe Moretz, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Mark Strong, Nicolas Cage: Extremely violent superhero comedy that seems to flaunt at the others. It takes the subtle approach to violence as seen in other superhero movies and cuts loose with graphic violence to showcase the horror of it. Aaron Johnson yearns to be a superhero, so after ordering a costume he sets out to fight crime only to discover that someone beat him to it. Directed by Matthew Vaughan who previously made Stardust. The visual elements are exquisite with comical appeal to the costumes. Johnson brings out the reality of the danger in pursuing such hobbies. Christopher Mintz-Plasse plays the eager son of a mob boss who soon becomes Red Mist. He partners with Kick-Ass until it becomes apparent that Kick-Ass is after his father. Mark Strong was effective as the villain in Sherlock Holmes but as the villainous father here he is weak and the role is standard. Chloe Moretz steals scenes as young Hit Girl who is trained by her ex-cop father to fight crime. To see her in action is both disturbing and inspiring. After all, she is lopping off limbs and gutting villainy at age eleven but her performance is tough as nails. Nicolas Cage brings humour as her superhero ex-cop father whose final scene hits true in the price of violent lifestyles. His costume resembles Batman and his first on screen bonding scene with his daughter brings a big laugh. This all concludes with violent consequences that are extremely graphic but its take on superheroes and the reality of danger really kicks ass. Score: 7 ½ / 10"

","Dave is a regular teenage boy who decides to become a superhero. However things are not as easy as he thought.

All three of them have the comic book atmosphere, the bold letters, the bright colors, the non-super- powers-regular-guy super hero. And they have great music\soundtrack. Plus, they are funny and entertaining. Kick-Ass also has a good storyline, great performances, especially from Moretz. Now, what I didn't like about this movie is the too much blood and cutting and killing.

"willcundallreview","8","1","2","3 March 2014"," A funny take on Superheroes
","Rating-8/10<br/><br/>Kick-Ass is a very good action movie based on many instalments of comic book franchises. The film's fight sequences are well done and are enjoyed immensely among the comedy which also run's through it. I found this film to be very good indeed and couldn't recommend it enough, all though if you dislike violence then maybe stay away, below I will tell you why I felt it was very good and why the sequel was warranted.<br/><br/>The story is fun and delightful to watch and with the action and comedy blending well together, it makes for an enjoying watch. The story is fast and has some fantastic fights and even the deaths seem over done just to kill someone. I like the way it is a dark comic book film and actually show's what a real superhero would have to deal with, except for the crazy gadgets we sometimes see used in the film. I also enjoyed the characters who wide range of personalities make for one hell of a ride and a thrilling story to match it as well.<br/><br/>Aaron Taylor-Johnson in the main role is good yes as very humorous throughout the piece. I enjoyed his little girl helper played by Chloe Grace who was fun but kind of crazy in her overly violent role for such a young girl. Nicolas Cage is funny but also the voice of wisdom in the film with Mark Strong playing a very menacing voiced villain who in the all comic book type action, actually seems like a real mob boss. Finally Christopher Mintz-Plasse as Strong's son is great and very funny at certain times, the entire cast do a good job and contribute to the fun factor immensely. <br/><br/>The writers were a cross between screenplay writers and the original comic writers who worked well to bring it to the big screen and still keep the hyper violence and quirky humour among it all. I loved the fights as I said and a great choice of weapons are used in every different fight, and with the last battle of the film, an even crazier weapon is used but you'll have to watch it to see that thing. Costumes are great and although can seem over the top and sort of cheesy they give the heroes enough darkness in there character to make it more serious like.<br/><br/>The film is over violent and contains some bloody scenes, for me personally I found it not the worst but for those less accustomed to violent films then this isn't for you, take it with a little salt and the humour will take over the violence. The story isn't that solid and isn't anything too much special plot wise although I will say it turns out much more fun than the plot actually sounds and so the film is sort of hard to criticise in a major way. Finally I did feel Kick- Ass is like so many other comic book movies and the synopsis is super similar to others but then again to say he is more a vigilante inspired by comics, it is quite different.<br/><br/>People who love comic book movies I think will love this too with it's fantastic fight scenes and costumed capers making this is a fun comic film. I said about the violence already and if you can't deal with that much blood and violent scenes then this isn't for you, but as I said just think of the movie as comedic and the violence part disappears. It has a sweet romance plot running through it too and could please many fans with it's darker tones sometimes being drowned out by more lighter loving genres. <br/><br/>Overall I give it a 8/10, a firmly very good movie and worth a watch I think it is indeed. It is the kind of film where you can sit back relax and eat some popcorn and truly have a good time watching it. Finally I said it warranted it's sequel because it truly did, and judging by this you would expect a good sequel, but that is yet to be reviewed here."

The action scenes are furious, the comical parts are hilarious, and (strangest of all) the emotional parts are really quite moving. Johnson does a fantastic job as a protagonist that shouldn't be the center of such a story. Kick-Ass has good intentions, but no skills, and at first seems more interested in finding lost cats. As the world he inhabits begins to expand we meet Big Daddy and Hit Girl. Cage is tremendous, phenomenal, and gives his best performance to date. He captures the sympathetic side to his character, as well as the darker elements which have led him to corrupt his daughter. His Adam West Batman impression is amazing, spot-on, and perfectly fits with the character. Even Mintz-Plasse surprises by playing a gangsters son, that actually wants to follow in his father's footsteps. There's so much to love and enjoy, it's hard to just compliment everything. There are moments where the fantasy becomes a bit too much, and kind of negates the whole ""real life"" hero themes. Some of the music choices are also a tad off. Like Tarantino, Vaughan has chosen music from existing films, but recent ones, making them stick out too much. Minor quibbles with such a great enjoyable treat."

","--- Spoilers --- <br/><br/>""Kick-Ass"" was a nice success at the box-office but never reached the amount of money grossed by ""Iron Man"" or ""Spider Man"" in any way. The cash box ways are mysterious ways, and the audience's taste is uneasy to follow. Moviegoers might have felt a bit disappointed by the lack of big action sequences like explosions or car chases. There's no super-villain, and the happy ending is somewhat... not so happy. Maybe they start to feel tired of Hollywood comic books adaptations, as well. Or they felt ""Kick-Ass"" was not that appealing.<br/><br/>That makes this film even more interesting to write about. Because, to me, its pure value isn't in any climax sequences or big blockbuster gimmicks (even if you'll find the usual comic sidekicks situations, love affair, one-liners, fashionable soundtrack and so).<br/><br/>""Kick-Ass"" has a social background and asks relevant questions.<br/><br/>What is a super-hero ? Why do people need to dream about heroes with costumes who can defeat bad guys ? Why some want to wear such a costume, even without super-powers or super-gadgets, which are used only to speed up story-telling anyway ? What's a bad guy ? And what is the frontier between a kind student wearing a green scuba-dive outfit trying to rescue a cat and a batman-like vigilante loaded with warfare weapons who applies his own justice and has brain-washed his own daughter ? The first three questions will find an answer in the movie, and that's its brightest part.<br/><br/>Kick-Ass/Dave Lisewski is perfectly well written and the movie gives his character the opportunity to go thru his daily life before the big adventure begins. That creates an empathy, which is the key element to identification. Dave is not a drop-out victim, he's just a young dude dealing with every day problems in a major American city, no more but no less. The schizophrenic background, which is usually the much-too-easy post-Frank Miller credo in super-hero stories, is replaced here by a social background, and boy, what an achievement.... The first and second acts are definitely excellent thanks to that.<br/><br/>Watching Kick-Ass putting himself in danger to defend a man getting beaten up by three hooligans while the customers of a diner nearby keep recording what's happening on their cell phones without making any move to try to help (but therefore, that will make him a YouTube celebrity), is a pure cinematographic joy as well as a strong adult statement.<br/><br/>Sadly, the movie won't keep that promise, the third act will wander thru the classic revenge / gunfight / get-ready-for-the-sequel flaws, and so much for the interrogations I was talking about at the beginning.<br/><br/>The great movie about a dreamer who wants to be a hero and gets hit by reality has yet to be made."
"rach_dll","8","3","12","21 May 2010"," Disturbing yet entertaining Ass-Kicking!
","It is a superhero movie nothing like what you've ever seen before. It has got no bulky, hoarse voiced macho men. Its got no super futuristic weapons. The heroes don't fly. In 'Kick-Ass' what you end up seeing is a bunch of kids who thrash real gangsters, and thrash them good. They don't care how old they are, they do what they need to do. Kick some ass.<br/><br/>This story is about Dave Lizewski(played by Aaaron Johnson), an average high school kid, with very few friends, no skills to talk up a woman and he even gets bullied by the other kids. But what he's got is love for comic books which when combined with building frustration over his inability to do anything cool, can be quite, lame. He gets this stupid gooey looking green colored costume and names himself Kick-Ass. He's got no style, no skills, but again, what he's got is, is a good heart and the will to do good things and not just stand and watch people do wrong things. But while doing this he gets his ass kicked big time! He looks like Ass-Kicked rather than Kick-Ass.<br/><br/>But then come our real heroes. Damon Macready/Big Daddy(played by Nicholas Cage) and Mindy Macready/Hit Girl(played superbly by Chloe Moretz) are a father daughter duo who want to avenge the death of the wife/mother and during that process make this world a better place. Damon very calmly shoots at his daughter, who's wearing a bulletproof vest, just to prepare her if there ever is a situation like this in the future. They play with guns and the girl knows inside out about glocks, tommies, bazookas and what not. She plays with a knife as if its a doll. She is this cute little 11 year old girl what when she gets down to killing people, she can be mean. Now both of them see Kick-Ass getting his ass kicked so they decide help him and form a sort of alliance to fight crime.<br/><br/>Now I won't spill any more details out for you here, but will they be able to defeat the gang-lord who caused Big Daddy to become a vigilante in the first place? Will Kick-Ass finally get to be a hero? Will he get the girl of his dreams? Watch to find out. Its a good entertaining film, a refreshing watch. Its got a lot of disturbing images which include a violent 11-year old girl hurling abuses at the bad guys and using cuss words in general. All this might look a little disturbing to the viewers and might send out the wrong message to kids everywhere. But lets not worry about the kids as they are not supposed to watch an R-rated film in the first place, so you can't really blame the director of the film. Its art. It's meant to be subjective. It's meant to challenge the norms. But she has played the role of her life and she looks to be a promising little actress who can really make it big in the future. Nicholas Cage is finally acting his age by not being some stupid burning bike-borne killer. The music just blows you away, with a very unusual mix of classics and modern remixes which are put into the scenes in a very effective manner which really jacks up the viewers enthusiasm towards the particular scene and involves him. All in all a good job by Matthew Vaughn who delivers another good product. I wonder when will he get a good BO hit. Its his third movie which is particularly good and interesting but like the other two this hasn't really garnered the money it deserves. I'll be waiting for Kick-Ass 2."

","I have to admit, I'm not a big fan of superhero films. But recent ones such as Watchmen and The Dark Knight have stood out to me and I have loved them. Kick-Ass is no different.<br/><br/>Kick-Ass skillfully combines audiences' love of comic books, movies and action to churn out the opposite of what you'd expect from a superhero movie. Although it has its serious moments, Kick-Ass has a mostly humorous and satirical edge to it, with well-choreographed action thrown into the mixture.<br/><br/>Although the movie as a whole is stunning, there are many things that stand out. One of these things is the acting, particularly young Chloe Moretz, who plays Mindy Mcready/Hit Girl. Kick-Ass does mot aim to be politically correct; Mindy is not your average pre-teen. As famed critic Roger Ebert put it, the role of Mindy is ""morally reprehensible,"" and you can't disagree. Mindy dishes out a lot of the carnage in the film and uses language you may not expect from a stereotypical eleven year old girl. Most people who aren't nit-picky will realize that these things improve the entertainment factor and deliver an extreme use of shock tactics and will love Mindy's seriousness. I certainly did.<br/><br/>Christopher Mintz-Plasse is also excellent in the role of Red Mist, the nerdy, yet evil superhero son of baddie Frank D'Amico.<br/><br/>Thanks to these superb performances, direction under Matthew Vaughn, an amazing script and lovable characters it was inevitable that I would love this movie. If you're someone who is skeptical about the moral reprehensibility of the film, watch the red band trailer first. But if you enjoy an entertaining, well-written movie, then Kick-Ass is a must see film. Definitely the best film of 2010 so far Great screenplay + superb acting + amazing directing + a great storyline = brilliant, entertaining movie.<br/><br/>100% Absolutely Stunning, Must-See 10/10"

"brodysixx","10","3","12","28 April 2010"," Kick-Ass - title says all!
","Ass needs kicked like Vogue have declared it reject stock, and there is only one man who believes he is suited to the task. When I say man, I mean a New York High school student, and just because he believes he is the only one, does not make it so.<br/><br/>From the outset we are lead into the idea of Superheroes and the Geek-favoured debate of 'why does nobody ever try to be a Superhero?'. Fair enough comment I'd say. The answer shortly comes along to Kick-Ass, that people are either too scared to react to criminal acts, or they will in fact get their asses handed to them on a plate. He thus takes it upon himself to intervene in a fight that is not his to be involved in.<br/><br/>Joe Public uploads footage from this ass whopping, served up by Kick-Ass to a group of thugs, and notoriety follows, merchandise released and the introduction (though only to Kick Ass himself) of two other vigilante heroes. Big Daddy and Hit Girl.<br/><br/>With a father-daughter relationship most father's would love to have, and daughters wouldn't, Big Daddy and Hit Girl are a hard-impacting, weapon-toting, deadly duo not to be reckoned with.<br/><br/>Vengeance is the motive for this pair of silent killers. Having kept their hero persona's private, the sudden emergence of Kick-Ass to the 'lime light', firstly takes any suspicion that would be creeping up at them, away, but could prove to make their job harder. However, could Kick Ass be more of an advantage to them than they realise? With start to end action, quips aplenty, even a love story that does not make you gag, this is what geeks and nerds alike dream of, becoming a Superhero.<br/><br/>Whether you are into comics or not, prefer romantic comedies to action films, this picture is a must-see by all. I dare you to watch and not laugh at least once. I dare you to not come away from this with your own hero outfit and name planned. Double Dare!"
"katchei-675-448818","10","3","12","27 April 2010"," Finally some originality at the theaters
","I went to see this movie honestly to waste a little time and was in a big surprise.<br/><br/>This movie probably receives more credit due to the drought of original thought from which movies currently suffer terribly but I loved this movie. Let me be clear here though. Action movies are not my favorite genre. My favorite movies are 21 Grams, A Clockwork Orange, and the Shawshank Redemption to name a few. I wish I could put 9.5 because I wouldn't like this movie to be thought of as equal to Magnolia or the Godfather 2 but I can't put a 9.<br/><br/>Back to this movie. It was awesome. It contained what Avatar lacked the absolute most and that is character development and growth.<br/><br/>In a time where making any action movie must compete with the Matrix or Spider-man 2, the action scenes were superb. I was actually worried about the characters and had genuine fear for their well-being probably because all the characters had some lovable quality.<br/><br/>I read in another review that this movie should have been called ""Hit-Girl"" but that's terribly inaccurate because aside from the fact that the movie is from Kick Ass's perspective, he is the character that actually has a true metamorphosis in the movie. There is a scene where he finally realizes what he is and what he must do while looking in a mirror and it is EXCELLENT. I don't know what it was, the music, his intensity, or whatever else but this scene was the absolute best in the entire movie.<br/><br/>This movie has comedy (and not that quirky joke every 10 minutes bullshit we see in EVERY OTHER movie), action, and is actually inspiring.<br/><br/>Thank you very much to the makers. I went to see it twice and may see it again because it's a pleasure giving them my money."

","Wanted to see Kick Ass and after reading some of the reviews about how shocking it was, I just had to see it for myself. Some reviewers in the UK concentrated on the Hit Girl character. They seemed to forget she was character in a movie and there was some moral outrage over her.<br/><br/>I like to judge movies for myself and bad reviews don't put me off going to see a movie. I had waited ages to see Kick-Ass, it had been out for a while but the theatre was packed.<br/><br/>This is an amazing movie, exciting, interesting, very original script, brilliantly executed and also very funny. There were many laugh out loud moments and many other awesome moments.

Well, it has that as well.<br/><br/>My partner and I both loved the movie and we don't often agree on which movies to see. We left the theatre on a high, both of us being throughly entertained.

"floorpopcornblog","10","3","12","24 April 2010"," The most entertaining film of the year
","In 2007, director Matthew Vaughan and writer Jane Goldman flipped the fantasy genre upside down and made it fresh with the brilliant Stardust. Three years later, they've done it to the superhero genre with Kick-Ass and it's bloody brilliant. There are swearing 11 year old girls, weedy kids in wetsuits decapitating henchmen, Nicolas Cage is actually pretty damn good and it's laugh out loud funny all the way through. It's simply a great piece of entertainment.<br/><br/>The film's premise seems pretty familiar at first. Dave Lezweski (Aaron Johnson) is a nerdy teen with girl problems who wishes he was a superhero. In fact, the film even starts with him saying, ""Who am I? You sure you wanna know......."" in a blatant spoof of Tobey Maguire in Spider-Man and it sets the tone perfectly straight away. He orders a wetsuit from eBay, goes out to fight crime and quickly becomes a YouTube, Facebook and Myspace sensation. An unfortunate accident leads him to having metal plates in his bones, a clear nod to Wolverine. Eventually his antics get the attention of baddie Mafia boss Frank Di'Amico (Mark Strong) and he uses his son Red Mist (himself a wannabe superhero played by Christopher Mintz-Plasse) to try and stop Kick-Ass. The real concern for Di'Amico though is Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) and Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz).<br/><br/>Whilst we're on the topic of Big Daddy and Hit Girl, they're really quite brilliant. Cage's character is a former cop with a ridiculous moustache who's spent 11 years of his life training his daughter Moretz into a lethal assassin. During their escapades he resembles Batman and she is something entirely new. She dismembers her enemies, throws daggers into their faces and refers to them openly with the worst word in the English language (yes, the one that begins with c, it's quite funny). The two of them ar completely deranged, Big Daddy shoots his own daughter with a shotgun in combat training and in return for her perseverance he buys her an ice cream. It's some real crazy stuff.<br/><br/>The casting, as in Stardust, is perfect. All the actors do a fantastic job. Aaron Johnson is perfectly cast and is fantastic in the role, Mark Strong is still the perfect villain in the whole film industry and Mintz-Plasse is also very strong. As you may well have guessed though, Cage and Moretz steal the show. Nicolas Cage is an absolute revelation. Years and years of looking dead bored in films like Knowing and National Treasure, he's clearly having great fun in the role. He also does a mean Alan West impersonation when he becomes his superhero alter-ego. Chloe Moretz though is absolutely terrific. An 11 year old saying ridiculous swear words should just be funny because it's an 11 year old saying ridiculous swear words, but her comic timing is so good that it's funny more from her perfect performance rather than just the fact that they're funny lines she gets to say. The Daily Mail will tell you otherwise, but she's a real hoot and a sure future star.<br/><br/>I've focused a lot on Hit Girl and Big Daddy and this could've been a real problem for the film. They're such great characters that it would have been easy to neglect the main plot. Thankfully though, Jane Goldman has crafted a masterful script to go with the great characters and dialogue. The focus always goes back to Dave's story and there's even a nice little romance sub-plot that's been weaved effortlessly within all the great action and comedy.<br/><br/>The action itself is actually pretty damn good too. There's plenty of blood and gore but it's all choreographed really well and is great to watch. There's hardly any CGI involved which is a fantastic change from overblown crap like Clash of the Titans.<br/><br/>As good as the actors are and as good as Jane Goldman's script is, the director Matthew Vaughan is the real hero of the film. Stardust was fantastic but this takes him onto a whole new level and I'm sure plenty more Hollywood studios will come calling for him now. He's brought together a great cast and created the most entertaining film I've seen in a long time.<br/><br/>Quite frankly, if I see anything more entertaining at the cinema this year then I'll eat a pair of socks dipped in guacamole.<br/><br/>5/5"

For starters, the acting was amazing from everyone. The comedy scenes had everyone laughing throughout the entire movie. The fight scenes were just amazing and enjoyable in every way. I really don't know how this movie could fail. The only bad thing for them was that the movie was rated R. If it was pg-13 The opening weekend sales would have been much higher.

"beastlyskter","6","3","12","18 April 2010"," It kicks at least one cheek of the ass.
","I am a big comic book and action movie nerd, and in no way am I a movie snob to the action genre. I'm the kind of guy who let things like the dance sequence in Spiderman 3 not get to me or the nuke the fridge scene in Indian Jones 4 bother me. Even though those scenes are incredibly stupid I try to look at the film as a whole, and worry more about story, characters, and action to be the big factor of whats good and whats bad. With that said Kick-ass has some of the best ideas, and characterization of any super-hero movie. <br/><br/>The main character Dave who becomes Kick-ass, is the likable nerd that we've seen in a hundred movies. However, it makes him very relate-able, and it makes the idea of being a real life super hero seem more realistic. His love interest thinks he's gay and only hangs out with him because of sympathy, and he only becomes a super hero just to see if it could be done. The action scenes with Kick-ass are great, because it truly looks like somebody not knowing what their doing trying to fight street thugs, and every hit looks painful, brutal, and realistic. The story gets really interesting seeing him fighting crime, because it brings on a chain reaction through the media, his social life, other heroes, and organized crime. There are some very serious and shocking moments and some highly comedic moments in the film which help give it even more realism. Real life isn't always comical or serious it is a blend of both. <br/><br/>So where does this movie go wrong for me? Two words. Hit Girl. Before you start flaming me hear me out. I couldn't quite put my finger on what was wrong with the film until every problem I could think of generally came back to her. For one thing she completely steals the show. She gets the most action scenes by far, and making her 11 years old adds to the shock value of her fowl mouth and her massacre of bad guys. To me it started losing it's charm once she was killing waves and waves of people. I understand it is supposed to be ironic, satirical, and funny but neither of those things work for me. Not only that but it takes away from the realism and the humor of Kick-ass's story. Everything seems to be in the realm of possibility. I could see an average high school student wanting to be a super-hero. I'm sure it has crossed a lot of people's minds. But having a 11 year old girl being trained her whole life to kill is suddenly thrown in to that plot really breaks up the rhythm of the film. <br/><br/>I also found the ending entertaining and funny, but I didn't think it was good. It just got even more ridiculous, and I didn't like what they did with Red Mist's character, but I don't want to spoil it for you. So bottom line. This isn't the new Dark Knight, or Citizen Kane of Super Hero films some people are making it out to be. It is simply a good action movie with some cool ideas, and some enjoyable yet completely ludicrous scenes. I think other film makers should take some ideas from the good parts, and people who like these movies and just want to veg out should see it."

","All right you runts, if you haven't seen it you may not get to heaven. Action,comedy and drama heaven that is. From the off set we are exposed to an array of great characters to love and hate. We witness the unbelievable scenes of 'Hit Girl' and we are gob smacked by the sheer scope of the ensuing carnage and language. We are played with by the story, again and again, never really sure what will happen to our heroes. The opposite is true of the villains by the end of the film. We kinda know they are doomed. This is one of the funniest things I have seen in my life, and whilst shocking, it does give us a reason to smile (That is if your not of a sensitive disposition!). Do not miss this film, or everyone else is gonna laugh at you for being too up tight.

When the movie was over I said to myself, ""man I really wish this movie wasn't over"", and then people started starring at me because I was talking to myself, but thats another story.<br/><br/>This movie is fun and action packed, this is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.<br/><br/>10/10"

","When I first saw the trailer, I dismissed it thinking that it would be another gross out teen comedy but when some of friends asked if I wanted to see it, I decided to join them whilst going in with an open mind and the result is amazing! The film maintains being funny from start to finish whilst being able to have a very dark and sad scene at the same time.<br/><br/>I watched this film over a week ago and thought carefully before giving it a 10 but the film deserves it. This is because it blends cool action scenes (Nicolas Cage has a great fight scene), witty dialogue and likable characters together. <br/><br/>The story runs smoothly and I never found the story boring. Where the Spiderman films failed, this makes up for it. I have to say though that I enjoyed this film a lot more than the Spiderman, X-Men and Hulk films because Kick Ass' director, Matthew Vaughn, keeps you entertained by introducing something cool and interesting or something that you did not see coming. <br/><br/>The acting is also great with Nicolas Cage giving a strong performance as Big Daddy, the super hero role that he was looking for and not Ghost Rider. Chloe Moretz as Hit-Girl is also very good saying things that are indeed questionable but they are far and few between. Aaron Johnson as Kick Ass gives a very good performance in a role that will surely make him a recognisable star in good time.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend this film to anyone looking for something that will be entertaining but also has a great story. There are a lot of cool action sequences such as one where they make reference Call of Duty, which I know will be more than enough to attract young people in. The director has a great understanding of how to use music in his films, similar to what he did in Layer Cake and he does it again here, assisting in making this a fantastic film."
"NolanFincherBoyle","9","3","12","17 April 2010"," Snatch+Kill Bill+Superbad+awesome acting+great soundtrack+tons of fun+faithful to the source material= Kick Ass
","Wow. I've seen this film twice, once at the midnight screening and then the next day with a bunch of my friends. Out of the 8 of us, only 3, including myself, read the GN by Mark Millar. 7 out of the 8 of us were pumped for this movie. And the one guy who never wanted to see this movie was dragged along.<br/><br/>Long story short, all of us loved it. The 3 fan boys loved it even more. And yes, I even thought it was better then the GN itself. And the one guy who never liked GN or comic book movies wanted to see this as soon as the movie ended.<br/><br/>But my god, was this movie better then I expected. From the Superman-like credits, to the fun action scenes and hilarious one liners, ""Kick Ass"" is a comic book fan boy's dream of an adaptation. For those who haven't read the GN, don't worry: your in for a even better treat.<br/><br/>Where can I start: the acting was great. With surprising performances from Aaron Johnson as Kick-Ass and Nick Cage being Big Daddy, director Mathew Vaungh turned out a lot of potential in almost every factor from this film. The star highlight: Chloe Moretz as Hit Girl. She was absolutely incredible, and stole most of the scenes from this movie. She had the best lines and certainly had the best action of all the characters in the film. But its Aaron Johnson that gives the best overall performance in the film. HE WAS Kick-Ass: Quirky, often shy, but always spoke his heart. Throw in some good supporting roles from Christopher Mintz-Plasse as Red Mist and Mark Strong as Frank D'Amico, and you got a great acting show.<br/><br/>The thing that makes Kick-Ass so great is how FUN it is. The entire premise is so simple but brilliant: what if someone normal like you and I wanted to go out and fight crime when no one one else would? You would probably die in the process, but thats why story of Kick-Ass works so well. Yes, its unrealistic in some parts, but thats what an GN adaptation is.<br/><br/>The action scene are bloody and filled with adrenaline to make even action fans like myself completely pleased, to the funny one liners and funny/awkward scenes in between the action scenes that filled in the story perfectly. My thanks goes to Mathew Vaungh and Jane Goodman: you have made one of the best super hero movies ever! Thanks to a great soundtrack, filled with mostly John Murphy scores and bands like the Prodigy, they help make ""Kick-Ass"" have that epic feel. Who knew the Banana Splits theme song would go so well with a action scene? Also, the script from Jane Goodman is layered and filled with so many things that made the comic so great. Its faithful but also makes changes that I think all reasonable fans can understand. Not everything from a comic works on screen.<br/><br/>Finally, Kick Ass's direction by Mathew Vaughn is also top notch. He uses comic book frames, along with a sort of English gangster story telling to move the story along with almost perfect pacing. Some scenes dragged on, yes, but they were all worth it to explain back stories and enhance the viewer into this world he created. Great job Mathew! Overall: GO SEE THIS MOVIE! 9.5/10, its the most fun you'll have in theaters probably this entire year. It has the storytelling of Snatch, the violence and music choices of Kill Bill, and the comedy and laugh out loud moments that has you on the floor of Superbad. (trust me, you will be).<br/><br/>Comic book fans would love it, Kick-Ass fans will love it, and movie fans will most likely have it in their tops super hero movies ever."

","I saw the midnight showing of ""Kick-Ass"" at the Regal Cinema at LA Live. I was not expecting much. ""Another super-hero film"" I thought. ""Great... How original."" And then the film began.<br/><br/>A lovable loser type (Dave) tries to become a superhero in an attempt to become what so few people around him are- extraordinary. He becomes Kick-Ass, a superhero who stands up for what's right in the terrifyingly belittling face of all that is wrong.<br/><br/>He starts off slow, training himself by doing some crunches and practicing some jumps but pretty soon he decides to test himself. After Kick-Ass does so, Dave winds up in the hospital embarrassed by his failure. However, he keeps pushing himself to be that compassionate hero who refuses to give into fear. Kick-Ass soon realizes that dying for what's right is better than living with what's wrong. He becomes fearless.<br/><br/>This is when the film really starts to take off and I have not touched ground since. What makes this film so incredible is the various ways in which it has the power to make you feel. I found myself absolutely incapable of restraining my tears of absolute awe. I found myself so profoundly moved that I could not stop the incredible surge of feelings that were rushing through me as I was watching. I abandoned reason because the film's beauty defied it.<br/><br/>""Kick-Ass"" is the most amazing picture I've ever seen. My grandparents generation had ""Gone With the Wind"" my parents generation had ""The Godfather."" My generation has ""Kick-Ass"" and it's the most phenomenal film experience yet.<br/><br/>Don't be put off by the superficial super-hero stereotype that the film most likely invites your critical eye to judge it by. This is a landmark achievement and a truly epochal work."

"thephaseshift","3","2","7","3 June 2013"," Shaking head in shock - a different point of view!
","This is for those who might be tricked into thinking this is a harmless teen flick about wanna-be superheroes. It isn't!<br/><br/>I admit it - I find just about any movie that shows extreme cruelty (esp. torture) in a so-called ""comic"" light disgusting. So if you're a huge Tarantino fan then skip my review. Personally I think torture can NEVER be funny, because it's just so damn horrible, and it's really going on in many places as you're reading this. But that's just me.<br/><br/>This movie takes the next logical step in Hollywood's ongoing march towards increasing shock value. By ""shocking"" I mean three things: (1) increasingly cruel scenes being taken for granted (torture scenes being considered ""funny"" - this trend took off with Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, two ""golden oldies"" that I personally consider pretty f'd up, even as a man - and these days no action film is complete without some good-ol' torture), (2) teens being shown to swear, masturbate (nothing wrong here, but it's just not movie material IMHO!), and basically act as crude and shocking as possible ""adult style"" - and this is supposed to be hilarious apparently...and it's gotten more intense in the last 10 years, and a more recent trend (3) kids (not teens - KIDS) being either killed, or killing others (obvious recent example: Hunger Games; until then it was pretty much taboo). On top of those, there's the never-ending *obsession* that America (and Hollywood) has with guns. REALLY big ones, and tons of them. It's a blazingly American phenomenon, and it's no wonder the USA has so many gun killings. I'm not saying it's *because* of the movies, but more that the movies *reflect* America's obsession with weapons as things that are extremely necessary and insanely cool.<br/><br/>So if you're into these recent (and not so recent) developments in Hollywood, you'll love this movie too. Basically it caters to the torture-loving, gun-totin' hormone-flooded American teen male of the 21st century. I'm not even THAT old yet but this is really too much for me, and maybe for you too."
"bbr347","Null","2","7","18 January 2012"," Kill Bill type movie with little kids? Really?.. and you think it is great?!?
","Let us see just how far we push it as a society! Yes, violence is a part of life. I am a realist and can enjoy a violent movie as much a anyone, but putting little kids in it and making them the killers, for any cause? Would this movie suffer at all if rather than featuring a little kid it had a young adult? What was the purpose? What is next, I venture to guess? First, they take ""Cars"" and turn a cute little movie for kids into a sequel where characters get blown up and tortured, aka James Bond (and get to keep the G rating!!!!) Now, trying to set a new milestone, comes ""Kick Ass"" which features a pre-teen little girl happily shooting, slicing and dicing other people, with utter enjoyment.<br/><br/>Up next, I am sure, a Disney movie featuring two year old toddlers armed with bazookas and gatling guns defending the neighborhood playground from local gangs, featuring plenty of blood and gore, with little bodies strewn all over.<br/><br/>If you really enjoyed ""Kick Ass"" without any reservations, take a good... deep.... look INSIDE yourself, and then ask yourself a few questions. It is not about how well it is made as a movie. It is about something utterly, fundamentally wrong with the entire premise for this movie, and the fact that most people accept it with little more than a shrug."

","This movie is one of the best movies I have watched! It is action-packed and absolutely hilarious!!! Matthew Vaughn who was Guy Ritchie's producer in the 90's and who also directed the incredible gangster crime flick Layer cake, did a hell of a job with this one.<br/><br/>Basically it's about a kid who wants to make a difference and wants to be a super hero and save kids tries the first time and gets stabbed in a parking lot. Then he gets hit by a car, which was actually hilarious the way they showed it, then gets metal throughout his body in the operation room to help him survive. He tries one more time and eventually finds out the real superheroes, Bid Daddy and Hit Girl. From then on the action sequences intensify and it's just plain pure fun to watch. The shooting was so precise and the action sequences were so accurately filmed, this was a first class movie to be enjoyed by most people.<br/><br/>There are some people that did not enjoy this because it showed a little girl swearing and killing villains in bloody graphic ways, but it's a fun movie to watch if you're only open-minded to watch it.<br/><br/>A perfect 10 out of 10!!!!!!!!!!"

","It was a virtual certainty, just like Joker said that Gotham will never be the same again, because Batman had changed everything forever by showing Gotham the true colours of the criminals, by the same token, Chris Nolan with his Dark Knight has changed forever how we view super heroes, by showing us the true colours of other super heroes and how hilarious they have been so far, not to say sorry excuses at being called movies.<br/><br/>And the result is Kick-Ass. Raw, dark, terrifyingly enjoyable and above all action packed with lots of blood and gory. In fact, the rawness of the movie may even be found offending and objectionable to the old school movie goers. <br/><br/>This movie is not a superhero movie that you watch with your children. It will not make you laugh (although there are some funny scenes), because it is not meant to make you laugh. It is not meant to be a Superman or Spiderman type of super hero movie too. It is something else, something of its own kind, unique even. Maybe, it has created its own genre... so that, when a movie like this is made again, we can say that its 'Kick-Ass' type. <br/><br/>My advise, and this is from someone who has watched many movies of all genres over the years, if you like superhero movies, please don't watch Kick-Ass, because after watching it you can never go back and watch those movies again. You will find them funny at least, and irritating at worst. But if you are willing to cross your frontiers and watch something which will leave you short of words when you're done, gasping for breath, sweating, adrenaline pumping...then my advise: watch it...and tell the others who are as crazy as us...."

","'KICK-ASS': Five Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>This is one of those movies that you're so hyped up about after watching it that you can't wait to tell your friends and see it again! It's definitely a crowd pleas-er and seeing it with an enthusiastic overwhelmed audience only enhances the effect of the movie. The film is a darkly comedic and excessively violent superhero satire based on the popular comic book of the same name (By Mark Millar and John Romita Jr.).<br/><br/>It tells the story of an average nerdy high schooler named Dave Lizewski (played by Aaron Johnson) who's so obsessed with comic books and super-heroes that he decides to become one. In his first attempt he's severely beaten and injured but much of his damaged body is replaced by steel implants which make him much more successful his second time out. He has no real powers but he wears a green costume and can take a serious beating. After being caught on tape and made famous to the entire world Dave, known as 'Kick-Ass' to the rest of the world, becomes an inspiration to people everywhere including a father, Damon Macready (played by a scene stealing Nicolas Cage), bent on revenge against the town mob boss (played by Mark Strong). Macready and his eleven year old daughter Mindy (played by the very impressive Chloe Moretz), whom he's trained to be a killing machine since birth, dawn superhero costumes of their own as 'Big Daddy' and 'Hit-Girl' and wage a war against the local crime ring which 'Kick-Ass' is believed responsible for.<br/><br/>The film is raunchy, hilarious, surprisingly emotionally dramatic at times and just an action packed blast to watch. It's extremely well written and directed (by Matthew Vaughn, of 'LAYER CAKE' and 'STARDUST' fame) and this is by far his best work yet. The film, like I said, is excessively violent and is probably the most violent super-hero movie ever made. It's been criticized by some for this reason but I think these critics are missing the point. The film is a great gift to comic book and super-hero fans everywhere and is already one of the most popular films ever in this genre (according to IMDb user ratings).<br/><br/>It's one of those movies that perfectly builds tension and then releases to the utmost satisfaction to the viewer. The score is perfect, the pacing and editing is perfect and the movie just hits all the right notes for it's near 2 hour running time perfectly. It's a classic that I'm sure will be remembered and loved for many years to come and anyone who criticizes it for it's so called 'offensive content' isn't watching the movie for what it really is; an inspirational and satirical ode to comic books and super-heroes; a masterpiece in my opinion.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pmr_F8e44c"

"Floh-Ruehle","5","2","7","4 August 2010"," partly funny, mostly disturbing
","I actually went into the theater with high hopes. I saw the trailer and really liked the idea and most of the gags I saw in there. Also, I can usually rely on the IMDb-ratings, as they resemble my taste in movies. I was highly disappointed this time.<br/><br/>The good things first: The movie has its moments. Some jokes are really funny and the overall idea still stands on solid ground. The acting by Aaron Johnson and Nicolas Cage is really solid and carries the plot, Mark Strong pleases as the really bad guy that he already pulled off in ""Sherlock Holmes"" and ""Rock'n'Rolla"". The directing is far from brilliant, but it is solid and doesn't annoy.<br/><br/>The problem with the movie is that it can not decide what kind of flick it wants to be. It quickly alternates between ""American Pie""-like teenage humor gags, serious character builds (thanks to Nic Cage) and really, really mindless killing sprees. Don't get me wrong, I have seen and enjoyed movies with tons of graphic violence (e.g. ""Shoot 'em up""), but they differed in two ways: First they were consistent in their presentation. It is really not funny, borderline disturbing, to see a movie change from children's buddy movie to a little girl slaughtering people, accompanied by aggressive music. And secondly, the killings are far from being taken seriously here. I guess, death is supposed to be funny and that made me forget most of the giggles I squeezed out during other scenes.<br/><br/>Over all: ""Kick-Ass"" would have gotten a solid 7/10 in my book if it sticked to the feeling of the trailer. It would not have been a great movie, but good entertainment if they had eased down on the violence a little. (Yes, I sometimes like violence in movies, it just seemed inadequately placed here) The way it was presented in the cinema, I can not give it more than 5/10 stars. The funny parts were ruined by the cruel action sequences, the action sequences were ruined by the strange split between not taking it seriously but still accompanying it with The Prodigy, and the serious parts alone were very rare and not able to save the whole movie.<br/><br/>Sorry, but I can not understand how this can be so overrated. Except if mostly kids saw it and found it cool to get some graphic violence in the cinema for once."
"jesse_nissinen","5","2","7","4 July 2010"," Not what you expect, and breaks rules if not movie laws (in a bad way)
","First of all they advertised this movie as a comedy, by making a short trailer where you only see the character kick-ass and his jokes, then you also get introduced to the other superhero characters, Red Mist, Hit-Girl etc. however all this trailer takes up are family comedy-scenes. Where there are very few off, and all of them can be seen in the trailer.<br/><br/>The intro of the movie is a comedy, made me laugh may I add. Then the first 'horror' scene comes in and I start thinking that this might be a comedy/thriller kind of movie, like a superhero movie for adults.<br/><br/>But then comes the main turning off point when we get introduced to Hit-Girl, a 11 year old girl who they have taught to say all kind of swearing words, matter of fact she seems to never say the same cussing word two times, every new dialog or one-liner she has she will use a new cussing word. Throughout the movie she have said more then 6+ cussing words that gave the movie R-rating in the first place.<br/><br/>I looked up the Kick-ass thing on google after-wards and noticed the whole movie is based on a GURO manga. Basically no-plot just ultra violence and brutal murders. These guro mangas are banned or illegal in most countries, so it's just 'f*cked up' they actually do and produce a real movie of these, and make commercial for it to be FOR KIDS.<br/><br/>People say it's just a movie and don't take it so seriously, I know this, I don't have anything against the ultra violence AKA Kill Bill/Sin City style, those are all CGI anyways, so the 11 year old girl actor is just jumping around with toy guns and having fun. But the fact they actually taught her to swear like a grown up and having lots of sexual knowledge a 11 year old shouldn't have is just wrong in all points, also in an interview she said she had read the guro mangas herself, wow her parents seem to have no glue what the hell they are doing.<br/><br/>TO THE GOOD PARTS. This movie on the other hand delivers and there's some really good fighting scenes, familiar to Kill Bill meeting Matrix. But unfortunately I can't enjoy any of these because all of these scenes are involved with a disturbed and damaged 11 year old little girl.<br/><br/>Even with the movie The Exorcist, they dubbed the girls voice by an adult women, which means Linda Blair never said a single cursing word in the whole movie, she was just miming other dialogs. Which isn't the case with Hit-Girl. Hit-Girl is actually saying all her own lines. It gives the idea that her character have been sexually assaulted her whole life, which we luckily never get to see, but wouldn't have been surprised if they had thrown in a child rape scene into this ruined movie.<br/><br/>0 Stars from 10 possible (BANNED).<br/><br/>If the movie would have been made without Hit-Girl.<br/><br/>8 Stars from 10. possible"

","First of all i'm starting this review off with the idea that no film, whether it's independent and artsy or all action and gory, is perfect.<br/><br/>So with that in mind i'll write my review of Kick-Ass, it's a great film that was let down spectacularly by it's marketing campaign, now i live in the UK and while i can't comment on anywhere else in the world i can say that the advertising campaign in my city made this movie look like 'virtua fighter kids vs the care bears on acid', lots of garish flashy images of teenagers in daft outfits.<br/><br/>i recently read that this film fell way short of it's financial targets, i'm convinced this is because of the god-awful ad campaign.<br/><br/>anyway....the film gripped me straight away, aaron johnson is a very likable character and while his friends seem like SUPERBAD rejects (more on that later), it's hard not to instantly empathise with him.<br/><br/>after about 20 minutes you get the idea that the flavour of this film is more to make you think about your own morality when it comes to helping others rather than watching nerdy kids running around in pyjamas.<br/><br/>After Kick-ass' first proper fight you can really get behind the character and against all logic....actually start to think that this story is plausible.<br/><br/>about an hour in you get to meet the true stars of the movie (as the critics say), big daddy and hit girl, lots of controversy over HG's use of the C-word, while if you read this it will seem gimmicky it's actually quite reasonable conduct for a character that spends her evenings cleaning up street trash.<br/><br/>saying that i found her character to be a bit of an annoying know-it-all, also christopher mints-plasse seems to have been thrown in as red mist for no discernible reason other than to ride the coat tails of the current cr*p that passes as comedy at the cinema.<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage is excellent as Big Daddy and his character gets the most emotional scene in the film, Mark Strong makes for a menacing gangster and Johnson's on-screen squeeze gets quite a few good comedy moments.<br/><br/>this film actually does quite well in the character development department, especially considering that this is part of the comic book genre.<br/><br/>the soundtrack is great and the plot never drags, at 2 and a bit hours long it's certainly more than most people would bargain for.<br/><br/>well worth a giving a go, even if the case artwork/posters don't seem to do it for you."

"CutSickAss","2","2","7","8 May 2010"," Dexter's Summer Camp
","I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy this film, because it was rather entertaining. The featured heroes are not exactly what you would call ""super"", but they do manage to get the job done... eventually! They are actually anti-heroes, so one could say this movie resembles ""Sin City"" and ""V for Vendetta"" more than it does ""Spiderman"", ""Superman"" and other classic heroic films. But the problem is that the characters are... how to put it... simply too young to be anti-heroes!<br/><br/>In my opinion the best description of this film would be ""Dexter's Summer Camp""... The fact that these ""heroes"" can kill people left and right without blinking an eye, without feeling any guilt or remorse simply because their victims were the bad guys, made me think of the show ""Dexter"". If the writers of the show decide to follow the books in season 5, and have Dexter teaching his kids the ""family business"", then Astor could be the actual Hit-Girl! This movie shows an 11-year old girl kill people as if she is playing a video-game, without at any point considering what she is doing might be wrong. And Kick-Ass himself doesn't think twice before executing a few villains, and is only concerned about making up the appropriate punch lines. It made me wonder: were Quentin Tarantino or Eli Roth involved in the script?<br/><br/>I enjoy watching horror films, I love all of Tarantino's work, I have no problem with violent action, shootouts, vicious fights, even sadistically brutal murder scenes in movies, but ""Kick-Ass"" actually disturbed me! The protagonists seem to lack the basic characteristic of almost all comic anti-heroes: the notion that even though homicide may sometimes be an inevitable action they must perform, it is still a most horrific crime. Showing children commit multiple murders just for the fun of it, without them ever considering the repercussions of their actions, is simply wrong.<br/><br/>Even so, I believe that most comic book fans will enjoy this movie. One reason is that it can be argued that ""Kick-Ass"" is progressive, since it deals with a somewhat different breed of anti-heroes; the ones who can fight crime, indulge their lust for death, and have fun at the same time! (Just like in ""Dexter's Summer Camp"")<br/><br/>P.S.: My username, CutSickAss, was not inspired in any way by this movie, it is just a (fitting) coincidence."

Instead I ended up fast forwarding it.<br/><br/>Here is a rundown of my thoughts:<br/><br/>Unbelievable. (x2)<br/><br/>You've got to be kidding me.<br/><br/>What a piece of $#@!. (x2)<br/><br/>Absolute garbage.<br/><br/>Have you ever seen those Japanese robots? The ones that can express emotions almost exactly like humans? Well I say almost because they can never get it right, & probably never will. No matter how good CGI gets or how good robots become there will always be something missing. A soul. Nowadays it's hard to tell actors apart from those Japanese robots. I blame this on Disney. Yes, Disney-style acting has got to be the worst, most artificial acting on the planet. Actors are encouraged to smile & talk in ways that they never would in real life. In short; they lack authenticity. To see a good example of this watch Cory in the house, or Hannah Montana. All they do is smile & move their !@#$in eyebrows! They can't act for sh!t & it pisses me off! This Disney-style acting has becoming increasingly popular & hard to spot, but if you wanna see a prime example of someone who uses it watch RayWilliamJohnson on Utube. His facial expressions kill me! I'm sick of these know-nothing people making it big. Not just the actors but the entire crew-set. Everyone involved with this POS! The dialogue wasn't even funny or smart. It seems like they're using the excuse that this was based on a comic-book, for the overall lack-of-skill displayed throughout. Sadly this isn't simply commentary on a movie or genre, but the continued downward spiral of America & it's cinema. I don't believe in god but after this can't help but ask; Why in God's name was this made?"

","I got back from seeing Kick-Ass a few hours ago.I really wanted to see it as I'm a fan of superhero movies, especially darker R-rated ones.I loved Watchmen! Kick-Ass is both a superhero movie and a pretty funny comedy.Based on the graphic novel which I have not read, the story is about a nerdy teenager named Dave who decides to become a superhero named ""Kick-Ass"".The problem is that he is not very strong or skilled.Meanwhile, a father and daughter superhero team named ""Big Daddy"" and ""Hit-Girl"", who are much more experienced than Kick-Ass is, decide to meet up with him, and end up saving him from some violent drug dealers, which the drug dealer thinks kick-ass is responsible for.The father-daughter pair plan to kill a rich drug dealer because he framed Big Daddy for drug dealing years ago.Meanwhile Dave falls for this girl who thinks he is gay due to a rumor being spread at school and the drug dealer's son becomes a vigilante named ""Red Mist"", just so he can bring the trio down.Kick-Ass works as a superhero/vigilante movie, but it also works as a teen movie.We see examples of Dave being a nerd as well as various pop culture references which would pertain to teens.This is probably the first R-rated superhero movie to feature teenagers.The character ""Hit-Girl"" is probably the best character in the film due to her funny profanity-ladden one-liners and ability to really do damage to the baddies.The actress did a great job portraying her.Overall, if you like superhero movies or teen movies, then Kick-Ass is the movie to see!"
"madbandit20002000","10","3","13","28 April 2010"," This is where ""Watchmen"" left off
","When I went to the 2009 New York Comic Con, I managed to ask ""Watchmen"" co-creator Dave Gibbons that if the movie version of his and Alan Moore's monolithic graphic novel of dysfunctional costumed troubleshooters would inspire more R-rated features that have superheroes, powerful or otherwise, to be made. Mr. Gibbons didn't think so, and I respected his opinion. Now, here comes the deservedly-titled ""Kick Ass"", a hard-hitting, morals-rattling, gallows-hysterical adaptation of the comic book, co-created by Mark Millar (co-created ""Wanted"" and a fan of Mr. Moore) and John Romita Jr. (son of the legendary Spider-Man artist and a legend on his own), that delightfully defecates on the grave of Frederic Wertham, the psychiatrist who, in his book, ""Seduction Of the Innocent"", crucified comic books for causing juvenile delinquency in the 1950s. It's a pretty big manure pile.<br/><br/>Unassuming NYC fanboy Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson of the upcoming John Lennon biopic, ""Nowhere Boy"") isn't the sort of ideal costumed hero, even when strutting in a scuba suit and getting nearly killed (!), but he feels he should be one because no one else is doing it (reason: sanity). After getting some metal implants, Dave becomes an Internet sensation, adopting the movie's title as his codename, and inspires two other loose cannons. Ex-cop/comic book artist Damon Macready (shameless fanboy Nicholas Cage of the National Treasure films) and his spunky, pigtailed daughter Mindy (Chloe Moretz of ""500 Days of Summer"") have revenge on their minds as their masked personas Big Daddy and Hit Girl, and their target is the callous mobster Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong of ""RocknRolla"" and ""Sherlock Holmes""), who despises this crimebusting fad, since it's ruining his enterprises, and lets his too-eager-to-please son, Chris (Christopher Mintz-Plasse of ""Superbad"") to become a hero, Red Mist, to draw the heroes out. In conflicts like these, all hell breaks loose.<br/><br/>Uh. . .what Keene Act? Directing the script he co-wrote (as the comic book was being produced!) with his ""Stardust"" compeer Jane Goldman, Matthew Vaughn (""Layer Cake"") has the courage and giddiness (!) to bring this adult fantasy to life, picking up where ""Watchmen"" left off, in terms of costumed crimefighters being in the real world. It's madcap bloody yet somber in some parts, because there are ramifications when wanting to do the right thing.<br/><br/>With his optimism and bravery, Johnson, in the title role, could be the perfect child/successor of Dan Drieberg and Laurie Jupiter of you know what film. Cage nicely goofs on Adam West and Hugh Beaumont while having bravado by Frank Miller. Mintz-Plasse surprisingly twists the tired mobster's goofy son joke while Strong dutifully balances patriarch and high-life scum.<br/><br/>Both disturbing and fascinating, since Jodie Foster's underage harlot in ""Taxi Driver"", the real thespian surprise is Ms. Moretz, a merry old soul who doesn't mind wearing a Kelvar vest while being a target (!) and using longshoreman vocabulary while dispatching thugs to the sounds of the ""Banana Splits"" theme song, an Ennio Morricone lick and ""Bad Reputation"" by Joan Jett and The Blackhearts (Are these in her head?!). She's delighted when she gets a bunch of elaborate switchblades and plays expertly with one of them, without cutting herself! Like the film's title, her role as Hit Girl has had critics, both film and social, all upset. I wonder if they've been upset when children are used as soldiers in an African country. If they've seen the film, were they upset when two characters were mugged at gunpoint and a bystander does nothing or one character's a hit-and-run victim? What about when a TV station refuses to air the unmasking and execution of two heroes, but the event's Internet accessible? It's hard to be morally upholding when you're morally selective. Ergo, hypocritical.<br/><br/>Evan Peters and Clark Duke are reliable as Dave's fanboy chums. Eye winks appearances by Yancy Butler (the Witchblade TV series) as Chris's mom and Jason Flemying (""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"") as a dim blub, mob-employed doorman are fun for fanboys. Mr. Romita Jr. nicely supplies an animated origin sequence, detailing the Macreadys' reason for ""suiting up"".<br/><br/>""Kick-Ass"" takes a lot of from Tarantino, Snyder, Peckinpah, Miller, Rodriguez, Scorsese, Cody, Smith, Apatow and Raimi, and it screams a loud ""thank you"". It'd be cool if the heroes faced social cowardice, an unspoken crime in our society, but they'd be out of work, if everyone had guts. This film certainly has a lot of them."

","Are you tired of the same old thing at the movies. Are you tired of the same old action sequences, often by the same old actors? Are you tired of being treated like an idiot-of-the-masses by movie businessmen? Then come to the cinema now and have your spirit renewed by Kick-Ass. Have restored that long jaded and dead part of the movie going experience that you loved (or at least appreciated) so long ago. Over the years, I have come to despise over-the-top action sequences, especially when they involve an invulnerable macho killing machine. I typically avoid movies that advertise these, and shake my head in disgust if I find myself forced to witness them. Can anybody say Rambo IV. However, Kick-Ass, primarily due to Hit Girl (Choloe Moretz) scenes, has brought back joy to me regarding action scenes. You can say this is due to a gimmick in using an 11 year old girl, but that is wrong. It is originality and style that has been missing. It is genuine creativity that is absent. Action scenes have become just canned commodities that the movie business judges as a profit vehicle. I just went to my 3rd viewing of Kick-Ass, and I have been more impressed by each viewing. There are many elements in this movie to be appreciated, which other reviewers have aptly described. I found the father daughter relationship between Cage and Moretz to be incredibly touching and heartfelt, despite it's ludicrous context. Action sequences are not even a priority for my movie-going experience. But they are done so well in this movie, that I had to point this out to others who have been jaded and discouraged like me. Go see Kick-Ass for any reason. But go see it for these incredible action sequences as well. They are clever, exciting, and stylistic. They are unique in all cinema, especially in this business-jaded age."

Thats just wrong on so many levels. So please Tom stop putting your opinion out there that isn't even an opinion at all. <br/><br/>In other news: this movie was really good and I would recommend it to all but the 12 year old sitting a row down from me. It actually has a really good story and you'll probably be surprised throughout the whole thing. It has great constant action, a love interest, some drama and the best part is that all of these things are in good balance. The only thing that I didn't like was the potential awkwardness at some parts in this movie. Once you see it you will know what I mean but it is like a pebble in an ocean. You will hardly notice this film's faults. <br/><br/>Bottom Line: Don't think about how good Avatar is compared to this movie. Just go and see it, have a good laugh and be emotionally impacted at the same time and hopefully come out happy that you just spent $10 on that. <br/><br/>B. N."

","I don't know about other people, but my expectations were so-so for the film, because all too often comic type films never meet expectations. Well there were so many things about this film that were absolutely great. Lets make a list of things in this move that actually Kick- Ass:<br/><br/>WHAT KICKED ASS IN KICK-ASS 1. soundtrack - so many great artists, and it goes seamlessly with the film. 2. nic cage - turns in a great performance for a character that provides several goosebumps moments, at least to me. 3. Chloe Moritz - amazing newcomer to me, but she was spot on in her relationship with her father. watching her and big daddy made me feel like i was watching kill bill, but better. 4. what gore - i didn't think it was as gory as everyone made it out to be, but it was still pretty intense. 5. fight sequences - outstanding! 6. acting - Andrew Johnson, as Dave/kick-ass actually does a great job holding the film together. the only other time i saw him in a film was for the illusionist, and he says like 5 words. 7. mood swings - the plot line is quite solid, as the film progresses nicely with next to no slow points. the story is told well, and for a comic/drama/comedy it created strong emotional changes for not only me but in the characters too. 8. cinematography - great camera work, very commendable.<br/><br/>You take this film for what its worth and realize its not Oscar material, but it is super well done for its purpose to entertain."
"ogwhizzz","10","3","13","17 April 2010"," Best Comic Book Adaptation Ever
","This comic book made into a movie is not only the best adaptation I have ever seen but is a fantastic movie in its own right. If you think about movie characters in general as being somewhat one-dimensional by necessity, it stands to reason that comic book characters do not suffer by being brought to life. Indeed, a comic book is already more or less a screenplay waiting to be made into a movie. So what does Kick-Ass have to offer? Great major and minor characters, excellent dialog, a sense of humor and a lot of guns. Somewhere along the way you will be drawn into the story line which, even if somewhat predictable, nonetheless will have you on the edge of your seat. Has it ever been done before? Sure, but what movie hasn't? There is nothing new under the sun. I left the theater feeling like a teen-ager, despite being several decades older, and that anything is possible."
"mito_ban","9","3","13","15 April 2010"," A Near Perfect Superhero Movie
","Kick-ass can be summed up as easily as Superbad meets Wanted meets The Dark Knight.<br/><br/>I've read the graphic novel Wanted by Mark Millar but haven't gotten around to reading Kick-Ass just yet but from the movie, it seems he hasn't lost his flair for blending over the top violence, wacky humor and irony.<br/><br/>The trailer was misleading - sure, i didn't do a lot of research heading into this movie. I thought it was going to be one of those action adventure comedies since Matthew Vaughn was director ala Stardust with a hint of British cynicism ala Layer Cake. My expectations were high because of the viral marketing and many different trailers set loose upon the internet and i was not disappointed. Not one bit.<br/><br/>However i feel that the weak link in the movie was ironically the eponymous Kick-Ass. His exploits though hilarious and descriptive narrative throughout the movie aside, i felt somewhat let down by his role in the movie. He was outshone by the side-characters including the brilliant Nicholas Cage as Big Daddy and precocious Chloe Moretz as Hit- Girl. Mintz-Plasse whom we all remember from Superbad and Role Models does a good job as Red Mist and Mark Strong, my favorite actor villain archetype does a great job once again.<br/><br/>This movie is like many people will call it, a fanboys wet dream. It has it all - just think Superbad meets Wanted meets Dark Knight. A bloody good combination of movies i think. Dare i say it? The soundtrack in the movie was Kickass...."

","Before stepping into the auditorium of Kick-Ass i had heard many good things but was not expecting it to live up to the media hype.<br/><br/>For the first half of the movie, even though i new i was watching a good film, i was left wondering where the media and fan based hype had come from as i thought Aaron Johnson's acting was less than an average performance and couldn't see how the story line would pick up without falling into the typical super hero formula which we have seen so often from films such as spider man and the fantastic four.<br/><br/>However by the time i had left the cinema it was a different story. this film had brought a huge smile to my face for many reasons; the way comedy and action are fused together in an un-cheesy way which allows you to appreciate both, how a thirteen year old girl has been allowed to create so much gore, hoe it had left me and my friend so charmed and also for it being a movie in which Nicolas Cage isn't a terrible actor...for once!<br/><br/>I urge you to watch this film as it easily made its way into my top 3 movies of 2010 so far which includes Hurt Locker, Shutter Island and now Kick-Ass."

But I love it when this happens - you go to see a film you knew nothing about, and you come out so grateful for having seen it! It was the funniest film I have seen in ages. One of those films where the time literally whizzes past because you're enjoying it so much. Every scene was comic in one way or another, and the action scenes were great. Not only did the film contain comedy, action (including lots of violence and swearing) there was also some emotional scenes in there, as well as a great deal of teenage angst. Fab. Seeing it in a packed cinema was awesome as well, as the whole cinema was either laughing together, or making noises such as 'oooh!' or 'ouch!'.

"sfwq62","9","3","13","2 April 2010"," Brilliant, funny and action packed.
","I went into this film half wary, too many films in recent times have shown promise of being funny new age epics but fallen so short of the line. I was in no way disappointed here.<br/><br/>The film builds up the main character very well, as a nerdy teen who just wants to get along, but is constantly hounded by bullies and embarrassed in social situations. It shows how he hates people for not getting involved to help others, how people just stand by and how this motivates him to become a super hero. The film goes great lengths to connect you with him.<br/><br/>Then we have his nemesis introduced as a boy who just wants his fathers approval and is willing to do anything to get it, and prove himself. This comes out brilliantly later in the film.<br/><br/>Then introduced are Hit Girl and her father Big Daddy, they are introduced in a way which shows their determination and portrays them as humorous and bad-ass.<br/><br/>All the characters in this film are amazing, and the action pieces keep you on the edge of your seat and amazed. Plus the use of soundtrack is almost to perfection here. This is a superhero comedy with deeper moral themes running underneath with your expected roller coaster of emotions and kick-assery.<br/><br/>Go and see this film!"

I had it hyped up big time in my own mind, especially after seeing the amazing reviews that it had already got on IMDb.<br/><br/>I think it's pretty safe to say that I was not disappointed by this film. I loved it. Kick-ass is a great character and is played well by Aaron Johnson. Christopher Mintze=Plasse was great as Red Mist and I didn't think about 'McLovin' at all when watching him. Chloe Moretz is a great young actress and her portrayal of Hit Girl was just amazing! But my personal favourite character was Big Daddy...Nic Cage was wonderful in this film...right down to the way he spoke like Adam West's Batman when he was dressed as Big Daddy. Brilliant.<br/><br/>The film plot was great too, we all want to be a super-hero right?? I know I have thought it at some point! This film takes that and puts it into a reality...well, in a movie, but you know what I mean. The actors played their roles really well, the young ones still acted like they were young even when they were trying to kill bad guys...showing fear at times and being strong when they needed to be.<br/><br/>The only problems I had with this film...I had hyped it too much in my mind, sometimes the soundtrack didn't work with certain scenes of the movie and at times it was a little slow paced for my liking...but that didn't take away from how great this was.<br/><br/>All in all this is the best film of the year so far. And in reply to my original title...is the the greatest super-hero movie ever?? I would have to say...yes, it probably is!"
"neil-476","9","3","13","1 April 2010"," Great if you're up for it
","This movie is going to upset some people. It is very violent, it is full of profanity, and much of the profanity comes from a pre-adolescent girl, and there is a great deal of moral questionability about it, all of which is tied up in a moderately humorous and fairly improbable tale of real-world teens taking up super-heroing.<br/><br/>So if that's not your thing, I really can't recommend it.<br/><br/>But if you enjoyed last year's Wanted, also adapted from a comic by Mark Millar, then it's likely that you'll enjoy this. The story is strong, the script is punchy and entertaining (although perhaps a little over-dependent on profanity), there is a lot of very well staged action, the characters are all fun, there are some enjoyable high school romance subplots, a great deal of comic culture texture, and there is a genuine sense of jeopardy driving much of what happens - it is entirely possible that anyone may get damaged for real.<br/><br/>I greatly enjoyed it even though there are elements in it which worry me a little."

","Watching the trailer you may think ""yeah this could be a pretty funny comedy about super heroes but maybe all the funny bits were shown in the trailer"". WRONG!<br/><br/>This is a very funny film but it is not a comedy, in fact it is very hard to put your finger on a genre that this lies in. I would probably call it a comic book, comedy, action movie but there's one thing for sure, that this movie will excite you beyond belief. It is one of the most pure adrenaline fuelled movies i have ever seen. So much so that there was multiple time where i just wanted to jump out of my seat and cheer in the middle of the cinema. This is not just because of the brilliant action sequences but mainly due to the fact that you have become completely attached to the characters and you are so happy that even though they have been through a lot they are totally ""KICKING ASS"".<br/><br/>It is the character development that does this film the most justice, this is due to great script writing and equally great acting. You feel like you know the characters so in that respect the film can really play with your emotions by making you want to either cry or cheer when something substantial happens to one of the characters. All of which are great, one surprise was the character of hit girl who provided most of the laughs and winces thanks to her outrageous behaviour, her violent action sequences and her brilliant characterisation.<br/><br/>The bottom line is you will enjoy this film. I can imagine when this comes out on DVD it will be one of my most watched films and it makes you wonder, why has no one tried to be a superhero before?"
"Velociraptor256","9","3","13","31 March 2010"," Brutal but brilliant superhero film
","If you're a fan of comic book movies, you should definitely check out Kick-Ass – it's not a typical superhero flick, and it's definitely not for the faint-hearted. As befitting the film's basic premise – the idea of costumed vigilantes in the real world – most of the action is grounded in reality (with a few notable exceptions), and while it's always thrilling, it's also very intense and often seriously brutal, enough to make you cringe. Unlike in many comic book movies, you really feel the punishment that the heroes both take and dish out.<br/><br/>That said, when the film's trying to be funny, it does that really well too – there's quite a few pop culture references and mentions of other superheroes, but they're usually humorous and fit in well, unlike some other movies. The acting is great all round: as plenty of other people have noted, Chloe Moretz steals the show as Hit Girl, and provides the best action in the film as well.<br/><br/>All in all, powerful action, great humour, and an interesting story make Kick-Ass a fantastic film."

It's a Smorgasbrod of superheroes from Dark Knight-esquire Batman (in 11 year old girl's clothes humming along to a Tarantino soundtrack) to a young Steve Martin in The Jerk-like loser role.<br/><br/>And that's what makes this film ROCK. It really does. Its bad language is at times shriek out loud funny. ""Is that all you C**** have got?"" yells 11 year old Hit Girl as she pumps lead into more brains than an episode of University Challenge.<br/><br/>""Take that you Mother F******."" When she gets angry.<br/><br/>Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz) is the movie-stealing find of the decade. She is gobsmackingly in your face as she DESTROYS hundreds of armed thugs (think O-Ren Ishii in Kill Bill, or even better her teenage sidekick Gogo Yubari).<br/><br/>It's completely out of order, off the scale, outrageous and freakin' hilarious.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage is great as a scheming and revenging madman. The scene where he practices firing pump action bullets into Hit Girl's chest is unique and remarkable.<br/><br/>This is a great movie.

Kids in costume going on the offensive against the crime lords. It is well written and sparkles with gore and humour.<br/><br/>The lead actor, Aaron Johnson is very Michael Cera-esquire but that is not a bad thing. It is a very fashionable film comedy era indeed and spoof movies are all grown up with emotion and deep characters.<br/><br/>I think if I am being over critical some of the fight scenes were a blur and perhaps some better use of slow-motion effects might have broken this up.<br/><br/>Definitely one of my favourite films of the year so far!"

","Kick-Ass lives up to the hype, and offers a whole lot more. With its cutting satire on the superhero genre, it has wit in abundance and packs a comedic punch that is unrivaled by any superhero film to date.<br/><br/>Last years Watchmen did its best to portray super-heroes in an everyday world, however its main flaw was its lack of connection with the audience. With Kick-Ass set in the modern world, it has a platform to provide great social commentary and really engage the audience.<br/><br/>Case in point: Kick-Ass (Aaron Johnson), our superhero, is propelled to internet stardom thanks to a little help from Youtube. Once he becomes famous, other masked vigilantes begin to reveal themselves. The plot may become a little obvious once the main details are in place; however the way each scene is executed is refreshing and exhilarating.<br/><br/>The acting from the main cast is top notch, Chloe Moretz who plays Hit-Girl deserves a special mention. She does steal some of the best moments, but Kick-Ass, Red Mist (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) and Big Daddy (an on-form Nicolas Cage) all have their moments too.<br/><br/>So while it may be a little cliché to say this film kicked ass, there's no other way of describing it that does it justice. It's a welcome addition to the super hero genre; don't miss out."

","Matthew Vaughn's (Layer Cake) latest film is an insane concoction of action, comedy, romance and drama under one big superhero-genre roof. Based on Mark Millar's comic of the same name, 'Kick-Ass' follows Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson), your typical male teenager, who follows through on every boy, child and grown man's dream of becoming a superhero (despite the fact that unlike most modern-day superhero's, Dave has not one extraordinary power or ability what-so-ever). Throw into the mix a Father-Daughter vigilante team, a love-interest, a wannabe superhero with an ulterior motive and a crime boss antagonist, and you have a pretty god-damn fun film worth two hours of your time.<br/><br/>Dave and his friends (Clark Duke, Evan Peters) are nobodies. They are the emblematic high-school students who waltz through their school hallways day-after-day, week-after-week, undetected by those at the peak of the social hierarchy including the attractive Katie (Lyndsy Fonseca). Bored of simply keeping a tissue conglomerate in business, Dave decides to take up the challenge of showing everybody that anybody with a costume can be a 'superhero' and thus his crime-fighting alter-ego of Kick-Ass is born. However Dave isn't the only costume-crusader cruising the streets as Big Daddy and Hit-Girl team (Nicolas Cage, Chloe Moretz) together, as any modern father and daughter would, by fighting the bloody fight with their own purpose in mind. The main focus of their combined anger is resident crime boss Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong) who will stop at nothing to make sure his merchandise reaches the streets. While Red Mist (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) also eventually joins in the fun, piggy-backing of Kick-Ass's success.<br/><br/>The true genius of Vaughn and Goldman's adaptation from page-to-screen is that they manage to brilliantly combine elements of pure violent action, touching emotional relationships and moments of comedy to break the ice between brains being scattered and tears being shed. The on-screen violence is brutal, unflinching and in your face, like a shotgun blast to your temple. From stabbings to the odd, inadvertent, accidental suicide, each action sequence is perfectly orchestrated to create maximum enjoyment. While true moments of tender, emotional realisations and witty teenage banter counter-act the vicious nature of this film, which is as disturbing as it poignant at times, especially when you're transitioning from a brutal beating, to an awkward father-son moment within minutes. It all adds to 'Kick-Ass's' quirky, little charm however.<br/><br/>Despite attempting to be a 'superhero' by night, by day Dave is still a normal teenager searching for his true identity, and of course, that elusive first girlfriend. Aaron Johnson plays this part perfectly, to the extent in which we should all be able to find a side of Dave to identify with (we were all young once...). Whilst despite competent performances from the veterans; Mark Strong and Nicolas Cage, the true gem of this piece is Chloe Moretz, the young girl who plays the hit-girl beyond her own age to a beautifully tragic tee. Hit-Girl is a ballsy, yet brilliant character who shows the audience that young girls on the big-screen don't simply need to be emotional vessels or tragic victims (this could potentially lead to the rise of the aggressive, twelve year old protagonists!), but they can be as dangerous as the adults that hope to protect them.<br/><br/>Probing the depths of the superhero genre in which many fear to tread, 'Kick-Ass' is something different which works pretty darn well. It's a violent superhero film, with a lot of heart and many hilarious moments."

"L. Lion","7","3","14","16 April 2010"," a mixture of the bitter and sweet - entertaining, but sometimes discomfiting
","Kick Ass is a good popcorn movie, but it's also a strange melange of the sweet and the pungent - like chocolate mixed with spaghetti sauce. It's really two stories with drastically different tones that aren't miscible. This can make some of the film uncomfortable to watch - it sets you up for one story, then springs a decidedly different one.<br/><br/>The first story is about Kick-Ass (Aaron Johnson), the eponymous hero. An invisible high school student by day named Dave, he takes it upon himself to dress up and fight crime. All he has is a costume - his fighting skills leave much to be desired, and he never does figure out that body armor might be a good idea. After a disastrous first experience that leaves him in a hospital, during his second encounter, defending an outnumbered man from gang members, he earns internet fame when a video of the fight is uploaded onto Youtube. His weapons are non-lethal, and his standing up to the bad guys is heroic. This is the romantic, sweet story - the goofy guy who wants to be a hero and also wants to win the girl of his dreams. Of course you know he's going to wind up in over his head, but that he will find a way to grow and win the battle and the girl.<br/><br/>The second story is a powerful tale of revenge that belongs in the martial arts milieu. Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) and his protégé and daughter Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz, a name to remember) have a beef with the town's drug lord, a truly vile mafia don named D'Amico. Unlike Kick-Ass, they are up against real killers and their weapons are lethal - guns, knives, grenades etc. When they hit they leave piles of bodies on the floor. When they catch Kick-Ass' heroics on the web they don their own costumes, and Kick-Ass becomes intrinsically involved with them.<br/><br/>The film's problem is that these two stories don't mix well. Watching Aaron Johnson's likable Dave try to earn his wings in an improvised scuba suit is winning and fun. Watching Hit Girl, an 11-year old in a purple wig and tights, administer head shots to ten bad guys in the space of sixty seconds is well done and exciting. But what the hell is sweet, goofy Dave, who when he is not Kick-Ass pretends he is gay to give the gorgeous girl he is in love with rub-downs, doing in the middle of this? Even Dave doesn't know, and as a result he literally tries to exit his own story. However the machinations of mafia don, and his known relationship with Big Daddy and Hit Girl, keep dragging him back in.<br/><br/>Kick Ass is a very well made film, and the climax is exciting and dramatic. All of the leads give excellent performances, especially Moretz and Cage, who have a touching, twisted daughter-father relationship. The writing is smart and witty, such as when Dave finally decides to don his Kick Ass costume and confront some thieves: ""I reached the point, like all serial killers, that it was time to stop fantasizing about it and just do it"", but nonetheless the film doesn't switch gears well. When it goes from being Can't Buy Me Love with a goofy costume to Kill Bill, there's nothing in between.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the script doesn't give Kick Ass the growth he needs to sufficiently meld with the story of Hit Girl and Big Daddy. When he finally accepts that he will have to partake of the violence that he has been trying to avoid, it is not because of internal growth, but the machinations of supporting characters that drag him back in. The story would have felt fuller had Dave decided to join Hit Girl and Big Daddy because of something that drove him from inside, rather than being thrust into the middle of it.<br/><br/>I do recommend Kick Ass, because it is exceptionally well made. The dialogue is funny, the action scenes are exciting, and the performances are great. But I don't think it will enter the pantheon of great cult movies that it aspires to, for the reasons given above, but it is worth seeing."

","I'm not going to repeat the plot outline because that's been done in all the other reviews so I'll make this short and sweet. Kick-Ass has raised the bar for the rest of the summer films headed our way. If any of them are as entertaining as this, then I'll sell the computer I'm typing this on. Every character is so well done, the action is top-drawer and the dialogue, well, it's razor sharp. Especially anything that comes out of Hit-Girl's mouth.<br/><br/>And it really is her movie. Chloe Moretz is one hell of a discovery and is destined to be forever remembered for this role, her debut, and THAT line. She simply dominates every scene she's in and is one-to-watch for the future. Her along with Nic Cage are simply outstanding and it's so nice to see an actor of his calibre doing something decent after what seems like an eternity of making dross. Mark Strong is also brilliant and actually gets some of the films best lines.<br/><br/>I can't find fault with this film. As well as being a)very, very funny and b)a corking action picture it is also a very subtle critique on the whole notion of celebrity and wanting to be famous and the crazed impersonators it encourages and the resulting swamp of money that can be made from it. But that's not really the point of Kick-Ass now is it? It's an entertainment first and foremost and I honestly can't remember the last time I saw a film that was this much fun. The blackest of humour, the slickest comic-book violence - all put together with oodles of confidence by Matthew Vaughn and co-writer Jane Goldman, who after Layer Cake, Stardust and now this, are fast becoming the best creative double-act in Britain. It only makes you wonder what Vaughn could have done with X-Men 3, considering the budget for that was about $150m and Kick-Ass had a budget of $28m. After Kick-Ass, the movie world will hopefully be his oyster, and rightly so.<br/><br/>Kick-Ass is out in the UK already but to readers from the US, you should be very excited, because you're about to get your ass kicked by the first genuine candidate for film of the year!"

","'Kick Ass' can kick ass as a comedy of well timed jokes but there is also some strong disturbing scenes of violence.<br/><br/>'Kick Ass' is Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) a teenager who is infatuated with Katie Deauxma (Lyndsy Fonseca) a long term crush he has on a girl. He loves comics and decides to dress up as a superhero and fight crime as 'Kick Ass'.

"MisterMxyzptlk","5","2","8","31 August 2010"," Clichéd driven.
","he most interesting aspect of this film, is the fact that it's essentially the origin of a superhero before he's a superhero. The explanation behind this is simple. Dave Lizewski ponders why someone hasn't tried to become a hero in the real world. Unlike other traditional heroes in the medium, Dave acts upon his instincts before any real transformation occurs and the result sends him the the emergency room. This is where's Dave story now takes a twist of fate and this is essentially where the film takes a nose dive. This is not to suggest the film is bad, but it just seems to fall flat by the second and third act. Consider the idea that the film is crucially setting us up for a satirical look of the superhero medium, but try as it might can't seem to get passed the birdbrained notion its a superhero movie. It stalls and putters along the way and by the climax, it's now entered the same territory it was initially critiquing in the first place. Nice moments here involving Nic Cage and an Adam West impression, but the film at the end of it all just isn't interesting enough on the questions it asks and ultimately falls flat on it's face."

"DICK STEEL","10","3","15","13 April 2010"," A Nutshell Review: Kick-Ass
","What makes this film stand out besides its plot which has maintained its essence from the comic book narrative, is how the characters got introduced and developed for this roller coaster ride. There are enough ups and downs as we follow the protagonist Dave Lizewski aka Kick-Ass (Aaron Johnson), who decides to take on the vigilante superhero persona because besides being fodder for bullies, he feels that it's time someone in the big city had the balls to stand up for the little man, with mask and some special ability of course, which in a way he obtains through the school of hard knocks for imbeciles, the first incident which indicates just how straight Vaughn will play the film out without unnecessary, cliché bullshit, which will raise some eyebrows at first, before you realize and be thankful that clichés are going to be out of the window.<br/><br/>For all his shortcomings, Dave serves up enough pathos almost equivalent of a cooler Peter Parker, sharing similar concerns and pangs as a schooling and growing teenager, only without the input of a radioactive spider. It's true when you put on a uniform that it can compel you to turn into someone else, and watching Dave stumble through that, with his taser and Eskrima sticks, you can't help but to feel for his character, and to eventually root for him to achieve something other than Youtube/Myspace glory.<br/><br/>Then there's the ""real deal"" heroes in the film, led by Nicolas Cage in a Batman lookalike costume. We know Cage had lost out on his opportunity to play Superman, so his Big Daddy isn't that bad after all, in what I thought was one of his fun, contemporary characters to date, especially when there's a really poignant backstory fleshed out through superb comic book panels, and tells of why he's so dogged in his pursuit to bring down the villainous drug dealer Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong). McLovin' Christopher Mintz-Plasse as Red Mist also departs from his usual pigeon-holed typecast and gets primed to showcase a lot more despite his limited screen time, so it's quite nice to see him step out of his comfort zone, and step up to the plate.<br/><br/>The one who clearly stole the thunder from everyone though, is Chloe Moretz's role as Hit- Girl, the uber-violent, take no prisoners vigilante with a foul mouth to go along with her martial arts skills. Raised under exceptional circumstances, she's a would-be assassin from day one, and owns just about every action sequence that she gets to flex her muscles in. There hasn't been a child character that had exuded so much caution thrown to the wind, and that's what makes her role refreshing (some parents will frown upon naturally), especially when her alter-ego is a cute, innocent looking schoolgirl who is obviously more than meets the eye, and one that comes with a glint of mischief as well. She's the biggest ass-kicker in the film, and she rocks big time, with the best lines, and the best moves. A definite favourite who has the potential to seal this film into cult fandom, the Fannings and the Breslins better sit up and take note!<br/><br/>To say anything more of the story will be to give it away, but suffice to say it also dealt with the modern day apathy, and obsession with popularity, online hits and virtual friends, where you find no-one lifting a finger to help a fellow man in need, but plenty of those standing around the sidelines recording everything for a youtube upload. It's almost anti-superhero in a way with its take on copycat wannabes who get into an awful lot of needless trouble, and deglamorizes or even shatters whatever notion that we earthly mortals will have about powers, to confine it within our dreams. It takes on the what-ifs, and plays it out in almost realistic terms on the kind of trouble we would expect, with threats obviously made to loved ones should secret identities be exposed, and that we'd really be psychopaths of sorts if we were to don a costume and start fighting crime in it, like the characters here who are living our fantasies, on screen.<br/><br/>Fused with great comedic timing and a rocking contemporary soundtack, my verdict of this film is that this Kick-Ass kicks ass aplenty! Oh, there's a Singapore connection in the film as well, so keep your eyes peeled when the end credits are rolling. I'm quite confident this film will have a placing in my shortlist for the best of the year when the dust settles. Highly recommended, don't miss this, and yeah, the M18 rating means this film gets released here uncut, so kudos to the distributors for not opting to dumb down the level of violence and profanity, which will butcher the film badly, and rob it of a layer of Kick-Ass-ness!"

I feel sorry for the Iron Man franchise, it's great but it was beat by The Dark Knight, and now Kick-Ass.<br/><br/>This genuinely feels like how it would be if superheroes existed in the real world, but with much awesomeness.

"TheUnseenMovieLover","10","3","15","4 April 2010"," An Explosively Entertaining, Near-Perfect Movie
","A costumed man stands at the top of a skyscraper, dramatic music playing in the background. As the public looks on in awe, the figure spreads his home-made wings and jumps. He drops towards the street, and smashes into a taxi. This is Kick-Ass, a movie which, whilst lampooning super-hero movies, also manages to be one of the best films that the genre has to offer.<br/><br/>After the opening splat, we meet Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson). A normal teenager (invisible to girls, small group of friends etc) and a huge comic-book fan, Dave tries to answer the unanswered question; why has nobody ever tried to be a superhero? So he dons a silly suit and becomes Kick-Ass. His first attempt at playing the hero lands Dave in the hospital with metal plates attached to his bones and severed nerve endings, making him more than able to take a beating. Dave's second attempt results in his becoming an instant celebrity. However, his new-found stardom catches the attention of gangster Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong), who thinks that Kick-Ass is responsible for the deaths of several of his men. Seeing a chance to impress his distant father, Frank's son Chris (Christopher Mintz-Plasse, he of McLovin fame) hatches a plan to hand Kick-Ass to his father on a silver platter. However, Frank doesn't know that the two real culprits, disgraced cop Damon Macready AKA Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) and his 12-year-old killing machine daughter Mindy AKA Hit-Girl (Chloe Grace Moretz) are on the prowl for revenge.<br/><br/>Combining pure rock 'n' roll, crowd-pleasing energy with old fashioned film-making expertise, Kick-Ass isn't just a blast of pop entertainment, but a startling achievement. If it wasn't for a little film called The Dark Knight, Kick-Ass would easily be my favourite comic-book movie. As it is, it will have to do with a more-than-comfortable second place. Kick-Ass earns the title because it's one of those rare movies where, as an audience member and as a critic, I couldn't ask for anything more. There is a huge dose of side-splitting humour, a nice splattering of mind-blowing action and a surprising amount of emotional weight. It is perfectly paced without a dull moment in sight, and I was actually sad to leave the cinema when it was over.<br/><br/>Much of the credit for this must go to director/writer Matthew Vaughn and co-writer Jane Goldman. Whilst Vaughn proved with Layer Cake and Stardust that he was more than able of delivering entertaining, smart movies, his work here is incredible. He handles the tonal shifts with immense confidence (something which he sometimes struggled with in Stardust), making sure that there are no jarring moments between the action, comedy and teenage/revenge drama. He directs with fresh creativity (Michael Bay, go find your dictionary), with his use of comic-book visuals especially inspired. The fantastic sequence detailing the reasons for Big Daddy's vendetta against D'Amico is a stand-out. He also stages some of the most electrifying action sequences of the year as if he has been doing this sort of thing since the day he was born. Both he and Goldman craft a hilarious, smart and knowing screenplay, throwing in references to superhero movies (Big Daddy's costume may be just a little bit similar to a well-known superhero), whilst crafting a genuinely ensnaring and original cinematic experience.<br/><br/>As Dave, Aaron Johnson is never anything less than perfect. Whilst it could have been easy to lose track of Kick-Ass in the midst of colourful characters like Big Daddy and Hit-Girl, Johnson crafts a character so interesting and sympathetic that you want to stay with him, whilst nailing the American accent to boot. As Frank D'Amico, Mark Strong crafts another powerful, menacing villain. Strong, as well as Johnson (another Brit), delivers a superb American accent, whilst creating a character just as colourful and unforgettable as the heroes. Christopher Mintz-Plasse delivers an intriguing and entertaining turn as Chris D'Amico AKA Red Mist. This role is meatier than the usual comedic roles that Mintz-Plasse is seen in, and he bites into it with relish. In an unexpected stroke of casting genius, Nicolas Cage is absolutely unforgettable as Big Daddy. Apart from a few select performances, Cage has been a bit, well, dead recently. Here, it's like watching a corpse being re-animated. Cage is clearly having fun here, crafting a performance which blends comedy (his loving expression as he shoots his Cavlar-wearing daughter is hilarious) and drama (a confrontation with one of his former colleagues is beautifully handled) brilliantly. However, the film is absolutely swiped by Chloe Grace Moretz. Whilst I think that all of the costumed individuals are locked for iconic status, Moretz's swearing, knife-wielding, near psychopathic Hit-Girl is a truly stunning character. Few child performers would have the courage to tackle a role like this, but Moretz's conviction and faultless acting make this a performance of unspeakable success.<br/><br/>The technical credits never disappoint, either. The soundtrack's note-perfect, recalling the work of Scorsese in the spot-on placement of each track. The production design elicits the feeling of reading a motion picture comic, which suits the film terrifically. And finally, as mentioned before, the action sequences are jaw-dropping. From a stunning, one-shot warehouse shootout, to a gun battle which effortlessly captures the video game craze, to the final OTT showdown at D'Amico's lair, this is one thrilling movie.<br/><br/>Kick-Ass is easily my favourite film of the year so far. It is near-perfect. As a Film Studies student, someone who has to listen to continual dissection of a film until you just want to cry, Kick-Ass is a breath of fresh air; a movie made by people who know how to make a movie which says from the get-go, ""shut the hell up and enjoy this!"" I did shut up, and I loved it. If the final, brilliant line is anything to go by, then we can expect a sequel. Personally, I can't wait. Kick-Ass by name, Kick-Ass by nature."

"khanbaliq2","8","3","16","14 May 2010"," All clouds have a silver lining.
","I didn't see Kick-Ass at a movie theatre, so I don't know how audiences reacted to it. But judging by its rating here many people liked it. I liked it too, and that's because it's the most original film I've seen in a while. Its violence and sexual content will turn off some viewers though. The film centers around Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson), a teenager who wonders why there aren't any superheroes in real life. This thought leads him to try out being a superhero. The film's realistic approach to this is often amusing. Did I mention that there is violence? A bit of it is hard to watch on first viewing, but just when you think it's gone too far things turn around. Dave isn't really a charismatic character. The film makes up for this with Hit-Girl (Chloe Moretz) and Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage). Hit-Girl is (at least for me) the star of the film. The girl's like a Mongol; determined, inventive and a great fighter. She doesn't have a lot of screen time, but whenever she's on screen things are more interesting. Moretz is very good in the role; she has almost the same effect as Heath Ledger's Joker in the Dark Knight (2008). In addition, she swears but in her case it's just plain cool.<br/><br/>Kick-Ass isn't just about the humour and the action. There's some good character development. Most of the fights are amazing, but the story turns out to be good and varied as well. There are thrills as well as genuine drama. The villains aren't a bunch of pushovers, so the heroes really have to give it their all here. And then there is the effective use of music. Yes, Kick-Ass has a lot going for it. Director Matthew Vaughn should get much of the credit, but every actor delivers too. Last decade's comic book and action films were obviously an inspiration on Kick-Ass, especially Spider-Man (2002) and Kill Bill (2003). However, the film's hero elements seem more effective than those of its inspirations. Because the fantasy elements are kept to a minimum here what the heroes go through really hits home. It's not easy to watch when they're in pain, but it's also thrilling when they succeed. The filmmakers smartly used this to good effect, especially in the second half of the film, which is even more exciting than the first half. And to top it all off Kick-Ass features one of the best (if not the best) uses of a bazooka in film. I recommend Kick-Ass; it even has a lot of replay value."

(Not content with just raiding The Bat Cave, the ""creators"" of this one even misappropriated Frank Miller's Robin-as-a-girl twist.) Paper-thin characters with an even thinner plot don't add up to much. For the past several decades, comic book writers have been trying to make what's essentially clichéd kiddie fare- the Masked Hero genre- palatable to ""adults."" One method often employed has been the use of lots of four-letter words (which is about as childish a method as one can imagine)- and sex (see THE PROFESSIONAL). Heroes have been done well before, and will no doubt be done well again, but KICK-ASS is little more than the Candy Ass kind of movie it tries so hard NOT to be."
"zetes","7","2","9","25 April 2010"," Interesting and entertaining, if not entirely successful
","Troubling, as pretty much everybody has pointed out. But I have to applaud the filmmakers and their studio for making it an R-Rated movie. Sure, watching kids get the crap kicked out of them and shot at is more than a tad bothersome, but it would be so much worse if the film backed off of the blood and violence. Without being able to see the pain and nastiness of violence, you're making it look innocent and fun, and if this had ended up a PG-13 film, it would have been much more abhorrent. Personally, I think the film has two major flaws which hold it back from being anything great. First off, the kid who plays Kick-Ass, Aaron Johnson, is just awful. I could barely put up with him when he was on screen. It was mostly his high-pitched, whiny voice. I really didn't want to listen to him, and I could never give a crap what was happening to him. Like a lot of the audience, I was always eager to get back to Big Daddy and Hit Girl (Nicholas Cage and Chloe Grace Moretz, whom you may remember as the precocious (and horribly annoying) little sister from last year's (500) Days of Summer). The structure of the story was really quite excellent, keeping those two characters in the background for the first half of the movie or so, so I wouldn't want that to change. The film just needed a more charismatic, or maybe even funny guy in the lead role. The second problem is what the film becomes by the end. I think it makes some salient points about the whole super-hero fantasy, that in real life anyone who'd try it would just get their ass kicked, and, as I said above, the violence and blood really sell the idea that this would be nasty business. When Cage and Moretz go nuts on people, at least at the beginning, it's not awesome. You're watching two nutjobs, one just a child, kill people. So it is kind of disappointing that the final act descends into a full-blown super-hero fantasy, with jet-packs even! And the happy ending coda is even lamer. Despite its major flaws, I did end up liking the movie. And, yeah, I loved Hit Girl and Big Daddy. Those characters are just fantastic. I think Bad Lieutenant is going to mark the turning point in Cage's career where he's insane and he's never coming back. I don't even think directors try to restrain him anymore. I love that, when he's in his costume, he talks just like Adam West from the old Batman show. Director Matthew Vaughn (whose previous film was the excellent fantasy/romance Stardust) really shouldn't have let Cage do that, but yeah. It's amusing. Moretz is most certainly a talent to watch. Hopefully she won't go nuts in real life, robbing liquor stores in a Hit Girl outfit in a few years."
"deanjcrawford","8","3","17","1 April 2010"," KICK-ASS Review (Minor Spoilers)
","Violence - Check! Sex - Check! Drugs - Check! Foul Language - Check! Burning Buildings and crazy costumes - Check! And this was just my bus journey through East London to the cinema. I was off to see the new Superhero film, Kick-Ass from Producer-cum-Director-cum-moghul-cum-Supermodel's husband-cum-lucky bastard, Matthew Vaughn.<br/><br/>The advertisement campaign for Kick-Ass has been huge. You couldn't walk ten feet without seeing a poster with the green, wet suited avenger staring at you. And after after watching several (extremely violent) trailers, I was excited to catch an early showing of the film and put up an early review. Those plans were almost scuppered however, as I didn't put my serious-film-reviewer-hat on as i accidentally got very, very drunk! A friend and I had pre-booked tickets to see the film at the Screen on the Green in North London. A lovely little cinema with EXTREMELY comfortable sofas with arm and footrests (well, that is the least you would expect for £12.50 a ticket!) and a little table to place your drinks as there is a fully licensed bar with table service. I had no idea about this and if I did I probably wouldn't have had the 5 pints with dinner as we went through a bottle of red by the time the trailers were over. Let's hope this doesn't hinder my review! From what I remember...<br/><br/>Kick-Ass is the total antithesis of most superheroes movies that has come before it. It's an R-Rated Spider-Man if you will. Dave Lizewski is basically Peter Parker in disguise. He has the same geeky demeanor and is ignored by women. He lives in the same colourful, leafy suburbs of New York and is beset by family tragedy. But where as a film like Spider-Man only alludes to issues of growing up and being a teenager, Kick-Ass slaps you across the face with them with a nunchuck.<br/><br/>Take an early scene in the first Spider-man film for example, where Peter Parker is exploring a new part of himself, shooting that sticky, creamy substance from his wrist in his bedroom. Aunt May is dismayed by the clamour and wonders what is going on behind closed doors in his room. She knows what he is really doing. We all know what he is doing. In Kick-Ass, no subtlety is needed. Dave is a typical teenager and is jerking off to his school teacher before the opening credits are over. When he becomes a superhero, we see him use his superpowers for good by having sex with his new girlfriend in the ally. The best quote from this film that sums up where Kick-Ass sits in the realm of Superhero films is this: ""With great power, comes NO responsibility!"".<br/><br/>All the characters are foul mouthed and vicious. The only other film i can think of that was similar was the Watchmen, but that was so dark and brooding, more in tone with The Dark Knight. Kick-Ass still looks and feels like a comic book, just with real characters. For example, before the film even begins we see a guy fall to his death trying to be a superhero. But he was not a hero, just mentally insane. It was refreshing to see a film that was fantastical yet set in the real world at the same time.<br/><br/>Aaron Johnson is good as Kick-Ass, as are the rest of the supporting cast, but the real star of the show for me is Chloe Moretz as Hit Girl. She swears like a sailor and and is more clinical with her gun than Dirty Harry. It's unbelievable seeing how sweet she can be in one scene, yet so convincing shooting up a whole gang in the next. Nicolas Cage is surprisingly good as Big Daddy and Red Mist still has a bit of the 'McLovin's about him but is still has some funny lines.<br/><br/>The directing was also quite impressive and Matthew Vaughn has clearly done his homework into the superhero genre. There are also some original moments to the film and the action sequences are exciting and exhilarating. It was good to see some great camera and grip work in the film moving Matthew Vaughn forward visually and stylistically. One scene in the lumber yard is particularly great to look at without compromising the story.<br/><br/>If I had any gripes with the film, it would be that it looked so similar to some other superhero films in tone, and was almost a shot for shot copy of Spider-Man in certain areas. I would guess the film-makers would say that this is the point as it was supposed to be similar yet drastically different at the same time. The film still worked however, and if this was my only complaint I don't think they have anything to worry about.<br/><br/>Kick-Ass is the kind of superhero film that you have always wanted to see. Kick-Ass could be anyone of us as despite being set in a fantasy world of costume avengers, Kick-Ass has no superpowers, no money and no special gadgets. Just a will and a desire to make a difference. I doubt people will try to copy Kick-Ass and try and become a superhero in their own right, but it has certainly given me a few ideas of my own. Not from a need or desire to do good and fight crime, but i might need a costume and some nunchucks just to make it back home through the mean streets of hackney! Wish me luck..."

","In the age of Marvel, Kick-Ass just isn't the movie it might have been. However, it does have a unique way of reflecting the comic-book inspiration, that later movies stole and made much better."
"carlos37andre","10","1","3","31 January 2017"," You have to see this movie if you like cinema!
","I had seen the movie for some time, and had in my mind it as one of the best things I had ever seen in the movies. After revealing it ... THIS REALLY IS THE PURE TRUTH! Let's try to start with ""top"". Matthew Vaugh's direction is impeccable, with few dialogues and scenes he manages to bring depth from the protagonist of the film, Dave Lizewski (Aaron Tayler- Johnson), to his friend with fewer lines, Todd (Evan Peters). Not as if this were any surprise, because I really want to live to see a bad movie directed by that man! Simply phenomenal !. I do not have anything to complain about in the script, there are no loose ends practically, and maybe even following a ""safe"" line, he looks different in his ""backbone,"" giving a face that we've never seen before for ""superheroes."" What today Deadpool is known to have done, and super lauded and credited, Kick-Ass had already mastered it more than half a decade before. So I think the timing of a film production is one of the things that makes it a big flop, or a big hit. Maybe it debuts today, Kick-Ass would just be ""one more"" because of the ""saturation"" of the industry, maybe if it had come out in the early 2000s, the movie would have been a gigantic flop, because the audience might not be Ready for it yet, and for the good fortune of all of us, this movie masterpiece came out exactly when it had to leave! I can not stop talking about the characters / actors, which are a high point as well. It would be impossible to speak of all here, but it is worth mentioning Aaron Johnson (the Kick-Ass), who holds the film with mastery, making us believe that he really is a nerdy misfit, even though not looking like one, and giving us laughter in Many moments, where the film makes that grace, making a mixture of ""R Comedy"" with action of a ""Tarantino level"". Chloe Moretz, (Hit Girl) is definitely in the role of her life, I've seen some other movies of her, and my God, this girl was really born for this role! With an air of ""innocent"" in some moments, but ""bad-ass"" in others (even for a 10-year-old girl), if the character is not the best, it is certainly one of the best things in the movie. And finally, a good movie always needs a big antagonist, and Mark Strong (Frank D'Amico) brings a villain stuffed with clichés of gangster movies, or even some superheroes around, but works extremely well in your proposal! Being a kind of walking whimper, which refers to countless other productions, the character is the ""cake cherry"" that the film needed (besides the final fight scene, where we really get scared by a certain character). Anyway, even NICOLAS CAGE will rock in that movie! Well, if you like heroes, or even if you like an excellent action movie, an excellent comedy, adventure movie ... actually: IF YOU LIKE CINEMA! You have to see this movie, everyone needs to see this movie, which comes up sloppy (like the protagonist at the beginning of the story) with only good intentions, and eventually becomes much bigger than I thought it could be ."

","The first half of the movie set up an epic superhero story. But in the end there was nothing epic - no epic story, no epic resolution, no epic fights, no epic characters.<br/><br/>Dave, Kick Ass, the main hero, ended up being just a regular guy that could ride a hero's coat tails.<br/><br/>The movie should have been named Ghost Girl and Big Daddy.<br/><br/>In the end we learn that hero's are just regular people who decide to make a difference. Duh.<br/><br/>It's like the writers got bored half way, or they ran out of ideas half way. ""Crap, we have to make an ending to this!"" The movie is like a roller coaster that brings you up to the top of a precipice. You look down at a 10,000 foot drop, thinking, ""how the heck am I going to survive the ride down!!!???"" Then a door opens at the side. ""That's the end of the ride."""
"zevt","5","1","3","26 April 2016"," What's wrong?
","(This will be food for thought for people that watched it, and not a proper review) <br/><br/>I really want to enjoy this movie more, and, in some scenes, the movie actually is great, but it just doesn't work as a whole. Like most people, I thought 'Hit-Girl' stole the movie and found her character great fun... at first.<br/><br/>Ebert felt the problem is that this character of an ultra-violent 11 year old girl, trained by her revenge-obsessed dad, that kills dozens of men without blinking an eye, is immoral and sad. Sure, this is true, but only if her character was presented as something to take seriously. And that's exactly what this movie did, unintentionally. Because it made her way too cool, because Chloe was simply too good at making her charming and real, and most of all, because her relationship with her dad and her climactic battle, took an all-too-serious turn.<br/><br/>See, you can't go for campy fun, then demand that the audience invest their emotions in a character that is supposed to be a parody, or an over-the-top fun cartoon character. Imagine if Wile E. Coyote was suddenly shown to be a desperate dad trying to bring home food to his dying daughter. What would that do to the Road Runner cartoons? Those cartoons feature ultra-violence and kids watch them all the time, but they don't feel objectionable (at least to some people), because of the point I'm trying to make.<br/><br/>Another way of saying this, is what other people said: This movie is too inconsistent in tone. Hit-Girl and her dad are a kick-ass fun duo, but then they are suddenly involved in a very dramatic, painful and sad death scene. The movie starts with a teenager who hopelessly wants to be a super-hero and fails realistically, but then shifts to an unrealistic 11-year-old super-fighter. All these approaches conflict with each other, which is why it doesn't work, and which is why I think Ebert was disturbed by a character that was supposed to be silly fun.<br/><br/>Also, both the characters and the events keep veering from realistic to cartoonish. One minute the guy is stabbed by simple street thugs and having sloppy street-brawls realistically, the next, his steel implants after a near-fatal accident make him stronger instead of weaker, and he is flying new untested gadgets in seconds and having elaborate stick-fights. Is this movie about nerds that want to be super heroes, or about nerds that get their wish fulfilled in some kind of alternate fun reality? Either one of these ideas would work, but not both! Make up your minds!<br/><br/>And then there's her swearing: I'm not against swearing in movies, but when the writers make her character swear for no reason whatsoever just because she is an 11 year old girl, and when, if you think about it, it wouldn't make sense that her dad would condone or encourage such swearing, it turns the movie into juvenile trash written by writers who would rather insert a juvenile joke into the movie than focus on what they are trying to achieve."
"williampsamuel","8","1","3","7 December 2014"," A hilariously graphic alternate take on the superhero flick
","We all know the standard superhero premise; regular guy is exposed to an A-bomb test, or encounters alien technology, or is part of lab experiment gone wrong. Then criminals kill his mom/dad/girlfriend or whoever, and he becomes a superhero to avenge them. Yeah, forget all that, we ain't going there.<br/><br/>Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) never gets powers, nor have any of his loved ones been killed by crooks. He's just your average high-school loser who thought it would be cool if there were real life super heroes. So he buys a costume online, and sets out to fight crime. Despite a rough start, and not being very good at fighting, he soon becomes a media sensation, bringing him to the attention of fellow vigilantes Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz) and Big Daddy (Nick Cage), and NYC's top drug lord. But life ain't easy for a super hero with no powers, and he might be way in over his head.<br/><br/>OK, so this movie is seriously demented, and seriously awesome. It's often hilarious, with incredible fight scenes. It contains shocking violence, dozens of F-bombs (many from an 11 year old girl), and a fair amount of sexual content. It's definitely not your average teen comedy, or your average action flick. I'd have to call it Superbad meets Kill Bill- with kids. It works because everything is done well, and because of the sheer incongruity of its elements. It's not every day you watch a pre-teen girl impale and chop the limbs of off gangsters while the theme from ""The Banana Splits Show"" plays.<br/><br/>Sometimes Kick Ass is pure comedy, sometimes it's straight action, most of the time it's a mix of both. Most of the humor is of the over-the-top offensive variety, which for me doesn't take anything away from its impact. Some of the funniest material is right at the beginning, when we get a look just how pathetic he is. His early attempts to battle evil are also pretty funny because of his sheer amateurishness. And this script can find comedy in anything, even a blood drenched mob execution. The more I think about it the more this reminds me of Reservoir Dogs.<br/><br/>But this movie can be dead serious when it wants to be. The action, as I said, is incredible. The early fights are pretty loosely staged, which is the point. It's just some wanna-be in tights taking swings at street hoods. But when Hit Girl enters the scene, it becomes pure awesomeness. She moves with incredible grace and agility as she slices, dices, and puts bullets through her enemies' heads. And the corridor scene at the end is like something out of Sin City. I still can't get over the fact that it's an eleven year old girl doing all of this.<br/><br/>I liked the idea of the villains planting a mole in the super hero community, and wonder why we haven't seen this before. (And no, that wasn't a major spoiler.) I also thought it was fairly cool that he becomes famous because of YouTube and immediately creates a Face Book page for his secret identity. I will admit that there are some slow parts in the middle. And the subplot about the girl of his dreams thinking he's gay- while funny- is dragged out longer than it should have been.<br/><br/>Still, this is one hell of a movie. It's side-splitting, action packed, and just plain nuts. If you enjoy Terentino or Apelow, chances are this is your kind of movie"

","Adapted from Mark Millar's hyper-violent comic book of the same name, director Matthew Vaughn's (Layer Cake) vigilante superhero film tells the tale of an average New York teenager who decides to don a costume and fight crime. Comic book geek Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) may not have good coordination or special powers, but that doesn't mean he isn't a fully capable crime fighter. After purchasing a flashy wet suit on the Internet, Dave starts busting up baddies with nothing but brute force. He calls himself Kick-Ass, and he can take a beating as good as he can dish one out. Before long, Kick-Ass has become a local sensation, and others are following his lead. Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) and Hit-Girl (Chloe Moretz) are a father-daughter crime-fighting duo who have set their sights on local mob heavy Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong). They're doing a decent job of dismantling Frank's sizable underworld empire when Kick-Ass gets drawn into the fray. But Frank's men play rough, and his son, Chris (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), is about to become Kick-Ass' very first arch nemesis. When Chris assumes the persona of Red Mist, the stage is set for a superhero showdown that could spell the end of Kick-Ass once and for all."
"paul2001sw-1","5","1","3","23 January 2014"," Too much 'bang' and 'slash', too little 'kerpow'
","The classic premise of many superhero movies is that an ordinary, even a wimpy sort of guy, has a second life thanks to his secret powers: think Spiderman, Superman or Batman. So the hilarious premise of 'Kick-Ass' is that a really ordinary guy decides to live a second life as a superhero, but without any super powers, and with predictably mixed results. And in places the film is funny. But a general feature of superhero movies is that the violence they feature is comic-book stuff, which enables the crime fighting vigilante to indeed be a hero, and not the altogether more ambiguous figure found, for example, in Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver'. 'Kick-Ass', unfortunately, combines its comic presence with a lot of serious violence. It's deliberately overdone as opposed to realistic, but nonetheless, it still falls into a long family of movies that seem to tell us that ultra-violence is cool. Some people can pull this off through sheer verve (think Tarantino at his best), but generally, I find the fetishising of guns and swordplay tedious, and to me, this blunts the movie's comic edge. To me, 'Kick-Ass' was less than the sum of its parts; maybe I have no sense of humour, but bazookas don't make me laugh."

My personal favourite of their creations, Kick Ass, has possibly the best movie adaptation of any comic book character in this utterly brilliant flick.<br/><br/>The writers have stayed very true to the comic book roots of Kick Ass, which I love. Other superheroes are often referenced, jokes are scattered thoughtfully through the script and the action is wonderfully over the top and really 'comic-booky'.<br/><br/>Lovable characters that I can relate to are abundant too. Dave himself is just a regular kid that lives his dreams of being a superhero, and as corny as it is, he doesn't let anyone stand in his way.<br/><br/>As a big comic fan, I feel as though this is the perfect comic book movie.

Some of the scenes were a little over the top though.<br/><br/>This boy is about a young nerd who always gets picked on and mugged and sees all of this happening in his city.

He is a great contrast to Hit Girl for sure by being such a normal high school looser teen, but it is overdone.

"rooee","7","1","3","7 September 2010"," Terrorism for the eyes
","Based on British writer Mark Millar's comic book series, this is an ultraviolent satire from the writer/director team behind 2007's Stardust. Like that film, Kick-Ass tweaks the nipples of genre convention to create something bold, distinctive and memorable. Unlike that film, Kick-Ass's central love story is between a father and daughter, the former educating the latter by shooting her in the chest with a handgun from ten yards. <br/><br/>The plot concerns a normal kid, Dave Lizewski (Nowhere Boy's Aaron Johnson) – not an uber-geek or a ruffian – who dreams of being a superhero. When a mugging leaves his nerve-endings ruined, he unwittingly finds himself allied with the twisted dream team of Big Daddy (Nic Cage) and Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz) as they seek to take down the vicious crime-lord, Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong). Impalements, over-sized microwaves and dual-handgun ballet ensue.<br/><br/>If film-making is a process of small judgements adding up to a single whole then Goldman and Vaughan get most the decisions right. The pacing is superb, with the snappy, fabulously foul-mouthed script bridging a series of thrillingly inventive set-pieces, chief among which are Hit Girl's introduction as she splatters the walls of a drug den to The Banana Splits theme song (a possible reference to the grandfather of the modern superhero movie, Richard Donner), as well as a first-person perspective rescue mission played out to a re-working of John Murphy's ""Kaneda's Death"" theme from Danny Boyle's Sunshine.<br/><br/>There are a couple of cons. D'Amico is a familiar mob boss with familiar patriarchal issues; he could have used a perversion or two aside from bloodlust. And Big Daddy's old police buddy (Omari Hardwick) is unfortunately sidelined, destined to remain perennial backup, as if too damn honest to spoil the party. And what about Xander Berkeley's sporadically glimpsed Gigante? Perhaps the sequel (""Balls to the Wall"") will share the love more evenly. <br/><br/>Unlike the bloodless, toothless, sexless Scott Pilgrim Versus the World, Kick-Ass spits vile anarchy from every orifice. Both films are wish- fulfilment fantasies for grown-up geeks, but while Scott Pilgrim reduces the sub-genre to 8-bit whimsy, Kick-Ass enhances it to glorious, eye- gouging HD."

I was disappointed to see Nicolas Cage (hands down, my least favorite actor, especially since he robbed Sean Penn of his first Oscar—I mean, ""Leaving Las Vegas,"" REALLY? Anyway, I digress) in this film, but I was satisfied with his fate. I'm not usually a fan of violent chopsocky flicks, but ""Kick-Ass"" was definitely a cut above—not your run-of-the-mill wannabe teenage superhero flick at all—I'm eager for the sequel."
"ani-atrocity","9","3","18","4 April 2010"," I can't promise this review is coherent, because this film was so mind-blowing!
","This film is truly amazing. I think I just gave away the entire conclusion of this review, but that's probably because I can no longer think coherently because it was so mind-blowing! Kick-Ass is the brain child of Mark Millar who wrote the original comic series and it's lost nothing of the original charm in its translation to the big screen (by Jane Goldman and Matthew Vaughn).<br/><br/>It stars Aaron Johnson, as the geeky lead and even in this guise he's a little bit delicious. I'm not just in awe of his looks though, together with Clark Duke and Evan Peters they give an amazing performance, and you can tell it all them because their lines are witty but the delivery and the background actions are ludicrously funny. Chloe Moretz gives an impressive performance as 11 year old hit girl, being only this age herself it undeniable that she can act (and kick some serious butt) but at times it felt as though she didn't always appear to know what was going on. The only other minor flaw seems to be that Christopher Mintz-Plasse appears to be playing his character from Superbad, again. This isn't enough to detract from the film as whole in anyway, more a passing comment you'll not when leaving the cinema.<br/><br/>The film is a triple threat; it can sing, dance and act. The soundtrack is superb, featuring the likes of The Prodigy and Ellie Goulding it's worth buying in its own right. It's use within the film is possibly the best I've seen this year. ""This Town Ain't Big Enough for the Both of Us"" by Sparks is used with such fantastic timing it will have you in stitches. The camera-work (and editing) is jaw-dropping. This is art house style with a mainstream budget, and it is beautiful. I want to hug the cameramen.<br/><br/>I don't know why you wouldn't want to see this. There is some serious weapons, some eye-popping action and some comic-book legends. If you want gore? You can have it. If you want laughs? You got them. If you want romance? It's there (and it's cute). If you want 117 minutes of pure, quality entertainment, I urge you, go see Kick-Ass."

I'd say only very early scenes are played for laughs. A lot of the scenes in the second half are full of suspense and only have 'light relief' for humour. It's comic in the sense that, say, Snatch is. If anything it plays out like a gangster film, with goodies and baddies taking turns to have the upper hand. Certainly several places were brit-crime-flick in tone. (Before you ask, yes it does work along side the equally strong 'teen comedy' side of things - he's unwittingly drawn into this murky world)<br/><br/>It was great to see the shot and dialogue nods to, well, just about every famous superhero film - usually quite subtly (I recognised some shots, although can't place from where), occasionally knowingly.<br/><br/>This definitely isn't a gimmick film - it's exceptionally well made, with an excellent story with no 'stupid' plot bits to think of, fantastic acting and characters you care for. Some of the action scenes are truly superb, and all different - there's some very imaginative stuff going on here. The trailer definitely doesn't have all the best bits (something I was worried about)<br/><br/>Actually, more I think about it, the more I think I've watched something superb tonight. Great entertainment and an excellent film. 9/10<br/><br/>As an aside, come to think of it, if the entire film was no-substance entertainment, like the trailer might imply, then there's no way critics would be getting such high praise - it would be getting 3/5, 6/10 etc.. Empire and Total Film have given it 5 and 4 stars because it's an exceptionally good film. Simple as that!"

","wow... after first seeing the advertisements for this movie i thought yea that this could be good, wow was i wrong. To start with the main character is throughout the whole movie a complete cowardly wuss, his ""super power"" is a rather shallow attempt at making an original super power and yet i noticed throughout the whole movie that he still acts like some geeky kid being beat up, i mean its not even a cool super power all that it would do for him is allow him to 'NOT' notice the fact the he is now bleeding to death. then we come to BD who looks like a cheep knock off of bat man has no interesting lines and is quite clearly brainwashing his daughter into murderer, wow good father ethics lol. the only good points in the whole movie would be a child killer totally trouncing professional killers lol, and the senseless violence, which is only a good part if you like death.<br/><br/>so basically what I'm saying is that his movie is only entertaining if you like violence and death as there is no comedy at all in the movie accept one or two totally failed jokes."

","Kick-ass is awesome! (Just a short tribute, nothing special to say)<br/><br/>This was a real superhero movie. In the beginning I was a bit skeptical about having to watch a movie in this genre, which was only 30 mil. in production budget. Seriously the Spider man movies ran from 140 mil. to 257 mil. in budget and this movie kicked their ass!<br/><br/>The acting was brilliant with a strong story, so it was certainly surprising to see so little turned into to something so great. Further more this is the first movie in a long time that made Nicholas Cage look good. This a good part for him. The music score compliments the storytelling and sets the mood for an exiting and fun adventure.<br/><br/>For all who love superhero movies this is a must see!! No question about it."

So just wait about eight minutes, because after those you'll be given a fantastic action/comedy/drama about bunch of kids playing superheros. But it's totally not for kids.<br/><br/>In the beginning, this movie is very realistic, almost cruel. Later on it gets more action and surreal but still fu**ing awesome!

","When i first saw the trailer for the movie i was overwhelmed by how cool it was. I had so much expectation for it that when the release date got closer i couldn't wait.<br/><br/>But i should say i was a little bit disappointed with a end product. Not because it was a very irresponsible movie showing too much of gore in tongue-in-cheek manner. I know exactly what to expect. I thought the premise was perfectly alright and had so much of potential but can't believe where it has ended despite of all of it. <br/><br/>Kick-ass definitely has its moments but the problem is it has nothing more than that. It is a movie of parts. And if you have seen the trailer you have seen the most good parts of the movie.<br/><br/>Half way down it almost completely loses it way. The confusion whether it wants to be about the superhero wannabe kick-ass or that of the vendetta of big-daddy is clearly visible. <br/><br/>Of all the characters only Chloe Moretz's hit-girl is worth remembering. Neither Aaron Johnson nor Nicolas Cage bring their characters to life. <br/><br/>Despite of all that kick-ass is assured to give you wicked fun for all those of you who find comfortable with the violence. The climax is a high point. If Matthew Vaughn has done one thing perfectly in the movie that would be the climax. He did just the things to end the movie on a high. And there is a surprise weapon in the climax to increase the awesomeness factor(and of course, i am not gonna reveal that).<br/><br/>Summing up, it isn't half as good as how good it could have been, still pretty decent for a watch."

","A lot of reviewers here are more concerned about others morals than just simply enjoying a film for what it is - if they went in expecting a superhero movie and didn't like le théâtre du grand-Guignol approach should have done their research.<br/><br/>This is not a film for dose whose only knowledge of comics and superheroes comes from knowing who and not what Spiderman, Superman are. This is a movie for those who know and have read Sandman and Mus, it's for those whose sense of irony and action is more in the Shoot'Em up, Wanted mould. I didn't find it that ""violent"", though it is, but it is as I said Guignol rather than action thriller, there are OTT bullets and knives aplenty around by the end.<br/><br/>The first half is really just about ordinary guy who dons a costume and messes up, but it is the second story of the cocaine mafia and Hit Girl that completely takes over and triumphantly steals the show.<br/><br/>This reminded more of the Tick than Superman, it is about a YouTube, Fark generation and it is fun, funny, and hip.<br/><br/>Not perfect by any means it is the best action film around at the moment and it full of self-irony and nods to a bunch of post-modern sensibilities.<br/><br/>All in all, surprisingly both stupid and intelligent, and well, just plain fun..."
"arthera09","7","2","10","2 May 2010"," Not going to change the face of film making
","This is not a bad movie by any means. It is an OK movie that I thoroughly enjoyed, but it will not change the face of film making. There was nothing remarkable about the film. The only scene that I thought was original was the one scene where where Big Daddy's back story is fleshed out. I like how it became a comic book itself and somehow was able to maintain the pseudo realistic tone of the film, while providing an over the top comic book back story for one of the characters. It was funny. The action was fun. The story aspect that allowed Hit Girl to attack the end guy was pretty well done, but for the most part I do not see what all the hype it. I enjoyed it, but as a movie it was only OK. The story was predictable and the trailer attempted to steer you in one direction it really did not pan out to have any engaging twists. Plus the ""hero"" gets the girl stuff really annoyed me. I thought it was silly and they attempted to build up to it but it was still a silly moment. Oh well. Fun to watch, but I will not shout it praises at the top of a mountain."
"ferguson-6","7","2","10","17 April 2010"," Kick-Ass. It most certainly does.
","Greetings again from the darkness. Just when you are convinced the comic book movie thing has been overdone, in swoops director Matthew Vaughn (the excellent ""Layer Cake"") to reach an entirely new level through a unique, unconventional and twisted approach. It does't take but a few minutes to realize that clichés mixed with shocks will mess with your movie-processing mind! <br/><br/>Somehow we are treated to teen angst,superhero-ism and most every human emotion and type between the two. WARNING: this movie is rated R and it is a strong R ... IT IS NOT FOR KIDS! The film slam-dances between ultra violence and uber-geekdom and satire driven slapstick. We get a 12 year old Chloe Moretz as Hit Girl, wielding weapons even more deadly than her shockingly adult tongue. Moretz was also a standout in last year's ""500 Days of Summer"". We get her revenge-driven ex-clean cop Big Daddy father (Nicolas Cage) in Batman costume mentoring her to the ways of a world class assassin. I busted out laughing when I realized that Mr. Cage's voice mannerism mimic that of the great Adam West while donning the black cape. A very nice touch. Our other home grown, would be superheros are Aaron Johnson as Kick-ass (replete with green scuba suit) and McLovin (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) as Red Mist. Most of these characters are one step removed from ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"".<br/><br/>Of course a comic book story must have a top notch villain and these days there are few better than Mark Strong. He delivers another terrific dead-pan performance as a drug lord and father to Red Mist. Strong's character is the driving force behind Big Daddy's quest for revenge.<br/><br/>Aaron Johnson's Kick-ass is an example of the clunky teenager who has a good heart and is desperate for attention from the girls. He even accepts being labeled as gay by the hot chick he adores just so he can spend time with her. He hangs at the comic book store with his equally geeky friends and then ""transforms"" into Kick-ass, a superhero with no powers other than a desire to do what's right and help those in need.<br/><br/>Mark Millar's script balances many cultural and societal observations while delivering a visual parade of images and sounds (wondeful music and score ... including ELVIS) and moments that will keep the viewer unsettled. You might think it odd that an early scene lingers on a giant advertisement featuring Claudia Schiffer. Ms. Schiffer is married to the director and becomes one of many tributes and satires throughout the film. It is quite a different experience and one that not all will enjoy ... but it is to be admired for reaching for new levels."
"blackdragon0731","9","2","10","16 April 2010"," Amazing movie, on par with Watchmen for me
","I give this a 9/10 because it's a movie that doesn't take a graphic novel or comic book series and butcher it (i.e. Spiderman, loved the first two differences aside but the third was disgusting.) or the X-Men. Although varying in places from the comic books in which it's based, Kick-Ass stays true to the source material much more often than it doesn't, resulting in a great mixture of comedy, action, and suspenseful scenes that make you wonder what's going to happen next.<br/><br/>For those of you who think the violence is over the top and too graphic, you need only watch movies like Watchmen or any other R-rated comic-book film. Chances are the violence is there because it was there in the comics, as is the case with Kick-Ass. Dumbing down the violence for a movie based on an equally violent comic would be doing the true fans of the series a great injustice and at the end of the day, those who decide to tackle movies based on comic-books are often great fans themselves.<br/><br/>If you don't enjoy a lot of graphic violence, you can opt out of seeing this movie, but remember it's not there to be ""hip"" as some reviewers are saying, it's there because it's supposed to be there to keep the movie faithful to the source.<br/><br/>I hope this review helps!"
"btacct","8","2","10","8 April 2010"," One of a kind genre bending at its best
","Incredible movie, I need awhile to get my mind around the genre bending of the story line.<br/><br/>The main characters are your typical Super Bad bunch of nerds, dorks or geeks. The main story line is a tale of revenge with a bizarre mix of characters aimed at the local crime lord with overtones of a Guy Ritchie crime racket (or throw backs to the director's 'Layer Cake'). There is some brilliant black comedy but the main story is very dark and sinister plot involving a crime gang (think Sin City and Watchmen).<br/><br/>A multi-layered movie, the director of 'Layer Cake' could well have called it an 'Upside Down Cake'. The super heroes have no super human powers, the real super hero is 11 years old and female, most of the characters have human weaknesses, the cake has some ridiculous looking icing or frosting (music and comedy) and the identities of the heroes becomes revealed to some of the players. Rather than depict super heroes, we see the absurdity of becoming a vigilante to solve the problems of crime. The problem won't be fixed by ""super power"" miracles nor will it be fixed with anarchy or vigilance. Our solution is somewhere within the opposite polar views or within our parameters of choice, but where?<br/><br/>The main heroes are Big Daddy (and he was no 'Cat on a Hot Tin Roof') and his side kick daughter Hit Girl (and she's no pop-star but a hit-man assassin dressed like a 'Little Miss Sunshine' and loaded with a mouthful of clanger killer lines). Meanwhile the nerds are at work discovering love in all the wrong places.<br/><br/>Best part of the movie is the use of music (in totally inappropriate ways): 'The Barber of Seville Overture', playtime was never so much fun with '(Banana Splits) Tra La La Song', Elivis singing Battle Hymn of the Republic (Glory, glory, hallelujah) and 'Crazy' boogied out in a car seat on the way to a crime.<br/><br/>It seemed to be mainly filmed in Toronto with scenes from New York to make it look like NY, NY.<br/><br/>Highly recommended!!!"

"Rachael89","9","3","20","3 April 2010"," Kick Ass: Supers With Bruises
","Superhero movies have ruled the box-office for the last decade. The X-Men, Spider Man, the Incredible Hulk and Iron Man have all become integral parts of popular culture, migrating to Hollywood from the relatively enclosed world of the comic-book. Kick Ass then, with its focus on the potential for 'real' super-heroes in a world governed by silence and complicity, is best described as timely.<br/><br/>Pop culture references abound. 'Youtube' and 'MySpace' (now I've thought about it, who uses MySpace anymore? Maybe the script was written before the Facebook explosion) play integral roles in the narrative, and in a great self-referential moment the hero of the film, unapologetic geek Dave Lizewski (played with a pitch-perfect accent by Aaron Johnson), learns that his crime-fighting exploits are to be adapted into a comic book (the film itself is adapted from Mark Millar's comic book series of the same name).<br/><br/>The story of Kick Ass is simple, which is probably why it's so appealing. Dave Lizewski is a nerdy, comic-book fixated teen, struggling to deal with his burgeoning interest in the opposite sex as well as the thugs who regularly snatch his lunch money. One day, he asks himself a question; why has no one has ever tried to be a superhero? He decides to take things to in his own hands, ordering a cut-price diving suit and heading out to fight crime as the eponymous Kick Ass. By the end of his first mission, he has been knifed in the stomach - not a great way to start a career.<br/><br/>Dave's next mission is more successful, and footage of him literally 'kicking ass' goes viral, attracting millions of viewers worldwide. It soon emerges that Dave isn't the only super-hero in town. Ex-cop Big Daddy (Nicholas Cage, doing a great Adam West impression) and his eleven year old daughter Mindy (alias Hit Girl) have an armoury that looks like it belongs in a government bunker, and more fighting prowess than characters you see in 18-rated video games. To watch an eleven year old girl sprinting along walls and performing back-flips is extraordinary, especially when you consider that the said eleven year old is also slicing peoples' legs off. 'Big Daddy' is taking his revenge on crime-lord Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong) for setting him up for drug possession before his daughter was born, systematically wiping out swathes of his thugs.<br/><br/>Chris D'Amico (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) - the rich-kid son of Frank D'Amico - also suits up as Red Mist, and as he and Dave join forces the threat of Chris's increasingly frustrated father becomes steadily more immediate.<br/><br/>Some of the best moments in the film are the most taboo. Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz) is clearly the stand out character here, a cyclone of killing prowess who takes out six knife-wielding junkies without breaking a sweat. The sheer wrongness of this situation isn't ignored, and in some senses Mindy is a normal kid. When her father takes her to a stretch of concrete wasteland to introduce her to the sensation of being struck down by a bullet, she whines for a trip to the bowling alley and a bowl of ice-cream. She is simultaneously a ruthless killer and a whiny little girl. Now I look back on it, it's quite unsettling to think how delighted I was to watch her cut down a ware-house full of criminals.<br/><br/>Kick Ass is a marvellous film, consistently funny and heart-felt in the right places. Although its opening sequence would seem to indicate it's a 'realistic' attempt to portray a super-hero, it's just as absurd as most other comic-book films. At points it came across as pure wish-fulfilment (case in point, an overweight, smug geek pal of Dave's getting a spontaneous kiss from one of the hot girls at school), but that doesn't matter. If anyone goes into Kick Ass expecting a documentary or a lesson on ethics, they will be sorely disappointed. However, if you want a film that will have you smiling from beginning to end, book your ticket now.<br/><br/>This is just one of many of my reviews.

Yes people, history is being written underneath our very noses! There will be those that are unaware of that for sure...<br/><br/>Now, let alone all clichés this movie delights us with, what overwhelmed me was this impression: ""the Japanese have Battle Royale, the British have that stupid book, what's it's name? yeah!

"SpartanIII","4","2","11","16 December 2010"," You're Better off Watching ""Watchmen""
","First off, let me premise this by saying that I loved the concept of this film. When I was younger I imagined myself dressing up and going around fighting crime and cleaning up the neighborhood. I mean let's be honest, who didn't? Up till the middle of the film it seemed that's exactly the direction this movie was going. Kick-Ass got his ass kicked when he tried to save stop people from stealing a car because the only fighting he'd ever done was in his mind, and in there you know exactly what the bad guy is going to do. But in real life you have no idea that's why people get formal training. So I applauded Matthew Vaughn on this by making Kick-Ass totally worthless.<br/><br/>But then something changed. The entire mood of the film shifted and all of a sudden it turned into your standard comic book movie. Suddenly, Kick-Ass knows exactly what to do in situations, and don't get me started on the end of the film. All I'll say on that is, I don't think you can learn to pilot a jet-pack like that in 2 hours, or attach mini-guns to it and not fly COMPLETELY off course when you fire TWIN mini-guns from a tiny little jet-pack.<br/><br/>The most disturbing part of this film however is the little girl. I think the whole reason she was in there was merely for shock value. I wouldn't have this opinion of it if at the end of the film it would have been more realistic for her. You know, like how an 11 year old should react to killing multiple people in gruesome ways; you have a nervous breakdown and end up being hospitalized for most of your life. Had they ended it that way I would have been impressed, but ending it with her being completely fine, that's what finally did it for me.<br/><br/>So watch this if you enjoy a cheap laugh or easy thrill, but don't look at it for any more depth than that. If you want that, the Watchmen film is much more suited for a realistic look on Superheroes, even with Dr. Manhattan."
"jgeorge3312","9","2","11","22 May 2010"," This is not an immoral movie
","Much of the hatred for Kick-Ass is because it is truly politically incorrect. Hit Girl and Big Daddy love their guns and are completely unapologetic about it. Many liberals have a knee-jerk negative reaction to anything that appears to be promoting guns or gun culture. But the real problem that liberals have with this movie is the way all the main characters have an unwavering dedication to justice. There are no bleeding heart liberals in this movie. Big Daddy and Hit Girls show no remorse or hesitation in ending the lives of morally-bankrupt gangsters who operate above the law and who are ready to murder any innocent person who gets in the way of their ""business"". Liberals hate the kind of moral certainty shown by Big daddy and Hit Girl. Even Dave (Kick-Ass) is ready to die rather than allow a group of thugs to beat an innocent man to death. Contrary to what many reviewers have claimed, Dave's motivation for being a superhero are not selfish. Dave is altruistic. He enjoys the fame (and sex) that his new vocation has brought him, but he is not driven by those things. His primary motivation is to bring justice to the innocent. This is why he is so upset when he sees how much better Big Daddy and Hit Girl are at exacting justice on the guilty. Which brings me to my main point about the so called ""immoral"" violence in this movie. The people Hit Girl and Big Daddy are killing are totally immoral, profit-driven gangsters. YES, this does makes all the difference in the world. Big Daddy and Hit Girl are not killing innocent people. They are killing gangsters who are ruining the lives of innocent teenagers by selling them drugs. <br/><br/>Remember the whole story with Katie (Kick-Ass' girlfriend) at the needle exchange? This little sub-story was a subtle way of showing how the drugs the gangsters were selling were turning other people into gangsters like themselves. Even Frank Damico is caught by his son smoking cocaine. There are very subtle messages like this all throughout the movie. Some reviewers said that the movie lacked subtly, and this is their most incorrect criticism. There is a lot of subtly in this movie but it requires careful watching and an open mind (unclouded by ideology) to see it. It is true that the lines between good and evil in this movie are clearly defined, but that doesn't mean it lacks subtlety in other areas. The scene when Dave Lewinsky, after nearly being beaten to death by gangsters, looks in the mirror and realizes what he has gone through in order to pursue his vocation is a truly powerful and subtle scene. Without using any dialog the director brilliantly coveys both Dave's pride and remorse at where his decision to become a superhero has finally taken him. This is a powerful and inspiring scene. The Dark Knight tried to do something similar in the movie's final scene when Commissioner Gordon praises Batman for being a hero who is ready to sacrifice his own reputation to save Gotham, but it just came off as lame and formulaic. In contrast, the mirror-scene in Kick-Ass was truly inspirational. Hit Girl's dogged determination to punish those who killed her mother and father is also inspirational. Her methodology may be violent, but her motives are pure. By the end of the movie the audience is cheering for both her and Kick-Ass. The scene where the two of them realize their true superhero-status by flying through New York on a jet-pack was a stroke of genius by Michael Vaughn. Kick-Ass is not perfect, but it deserves a lot more credit than some reviewers have given it. I strongly question the motivations of those who are trashing it."

I was laughing so hard at that scene.<br/><br/>As for the effects and stuff, well they were nice. Lots of cool things going on in the movie.<br/><br/>Another great 'superhero' movie without super powers. Although ""Kick Ass"" is cool, it just doesn't reach ""Defendor"" to the knees.

But like many things I enjoy on this planet (beer, women, etc.), I felt as though it too was being abused. <br/><br/>When I went to the movies to see this film, I noticed an adolescent surplus (a sh*tload of little kids present) and that had me concerned (a manly, man ""concerned"", you know. Like, ""Yo! Are you alright, b*tch?! Just checkin'!""). This film may appear kid-friendly, but it's anything but. It's like a decapitated head dipped in chocolate, covered in sprinkles. With that said, parents, please closely examine and peruse this film as well as countless others, before your kids view them.<br/><br/>Sidenote: I hate little kids (I hope your swings break in mid-flight), not all, just a good amount. In fact, the only reason why I work summer camps is so that (1) I can make money with relative ease and (2) I can offer up some retribution in the form of a dodgeball. (""Take that Jason Voorhees! Now, limp it off."").<br/><br/>There's only one thing I hate more than bad little kids and that's irresponsible parents.<br/><br/>Alright, now back to the movie. It was absolutely absurd, yet brilliant. Everything is done in such good taste—the dialogue, action sequences, and story, as it effectively applies the ""unpredictably"" element or element of surprise to all facets.<br/><br/>I'm as perceptive as they come, but as soon as I saw Nicholas Cage discharge a firearm on his daughter, I knew then, to simply put my brain away, back in the cupboard, and just sit back and be thrilled by this outlandish spectacle that is 'Kickass'.<br/><br/>My only gripe, if I had one would be the questionable use of some of the younger cast members. <br/><br/>If you find my sense of humor amusing and/or enjoyed 'The Punisher: War Zone', then you'll enjoy this film.<br/><br/>Grade: A<br/><br/>Recommendations: <br/><br/>1.

","Lets keep it simple. Kick Ass is not your usual super hero movie, It have something different to offer. I will call this movie a pulp of The dark knight, Spider man, Kill bill and Super bad. Its a teen movie with adult theme and it bends perfectly well. I know there is a hype against the Violence and language specially about the 11 yr old ""Hit-Girl"". Its a fictional movie and let be fictional. Yes may be some parents will offend to see that. If all directors started to care about parents, only Disney will survive... anyway thats not my point. Watch Kick-Ass if you want something new in superhero/comic movies, because it really kick ass."
"montera_iulian","7","2","11","7 May 2010"," LMAO! Great Comic Interpretation Of Superhero Movies!!
","This movie was F'n magnificent. It was more than that. The plot, it's not as simple as some people may think. Matter of fact I will not give any idea about what's going on but I will say the screenplay was simply great... Things you will like about kick-ass besides the plot, is the dialogue which is funny and intelligently built, you will love the action scenes which are pretty awesome made and the delivery of this superhero satire. It's funny, It's hilarious, it's creative, it's not clicheic and definitely it deserves the appreciation.<br/><br/>The movie was edited very well and the cinematography used in this movie gave it a big personality. You would see a lot of scenes taken from different action movies not only superhero ones just to mention some: ""28 Months Later"", ""Smokin"" Aces"", ""Bourne Identity"", ""Scarface"" or ""Kill Bill"". Isn't that awesomely weird? The acting in this movie was great for this type, I really felt the vibe, I mean, I really liked Cage in this movie though he looked a lot like Harvey (The Lovely Bones) portrayed by Stanley Tucci.<br/><br/>The score used for this movie was HUGE! I mean you had the ""28 Months Later"" version remade, ""The Dark Knight"" score by Hans Zimmer remade, and a lot of other movies but I mention only these just to give you an info on how good this movie actually is.<br/><br/>Things you may find disturbing: 1. The violence which is unexpectedly big.<br/><br/>2. The language used especially from an 11-12 years old girl.<br/><br/>Other than that... this is way more fun and intense than a lot of these movies coming out from Hollywood these days."
"socrates99","9","2","11","6 May 2010"," Can't fault this flick - it's heart is more than admirable
","This is a crowd pleaser set in New England where the sometimes over-the- top action is populated with the kind of characters any great story needs. Haven't we all wanted to don a cape and mask and even the score? This amounts to a pleasant dream exploring the notion.<br/><br/>I'd heard a lot of grumbling about Hit Girl especially, but focusing on that part of this little tour de force is truly a mistake. This movie is a rousing ode to the sheer pleasure to be gained from stamping out bad people. Apparently most people don't understand Hit Girl's fairly obvious function here, she allows the whole exercise to seem lighter than air by putting a smile on our face and reassuring us they're not serious about wanting us to take matters in our own hands. It's way too dangerous and we've been made nearly useless from our sedentary lives.<br/><br/>Hit Girl's a delightful masterstroke and if Chloe Moretz were my kid I wouldn't have the least problem letting her take the role. After all, how many kids could have pulled it off as well.<br/><br/>But Aaron Johnson, the Kick Ass, is no afterthought either. He's completely believable and likable as the overly optimistic teenager. We ache to see him get in a few licks."
"alvarhaggis","9","2","11","6 May 2010"," Simply Kick Ass
","Kick Ass is a story we've seen before. The story of a young teen bored with life, disillusioned by the modern World he lives in. A social outcast and dare I say instantly forgettable being. One day he decides to make a difference and sets out on a journey of self discovery and acceptance.<br/><br/>Sure we've seen the story a million times, but never like this. For the first time in several years I sat through a movie without my mind wandering or squirming in chair thinking of the numb piece of ass I am getting. Kick Ass does exactly what it says - It Kicks Ass big time.<br/><br/>The story is great, the characters perfect, the pace is superb, the soundtrack is killer and the action is dazzling. All of the actors are absolutely fantastic in their roles. In particular, Chloe Moretz is simply stunning and you could feel the whole theatre get a lift every time she appears on the screen. At 11 years old, she is all the more impressive. She is surely destined for a wonderful career.<br/><br/>The movies humour is genuinely humorous and not of the usual half-a-smirk variety. The action is intense and extremely violent, but, that's what we all kind of want if we are honest. I say your a kidding yourself if you enjoyed all of Saving Private Ryan as much as the first 15 minutes.<br/><br/>The two stand out things for me though are the movies perfect pace and sublime soundtrack. There are no dull moments in this movie, there is no sagging in the middle, no dreary introductions. The entire movie sits perfectly. The soundtrack could not be more perfect either. Everything works so well.<br/><br/>This movie was simply fantastic and will be my new favourite in my Blu Ray collection when it comes out. Although very graphic and violent, it still seems to have this charm about it and I would recommend it to all adults. Not one for the kids though.........."
"dimitrisalomao","8","2","11","5 May 2010"," Brilliant, immoral and a lot more...
","The critic Charles Koplinski wrote, ""Kick-Ass is only half right."", but let me put it this way, ""Kick-Ass"" is half brilliant, but it's half immoral, and lacks rhythm. When I left the theater I was amazed about how good this film was, but then I started thinking about how many immoral messages and lack of depth (Which as OK when the movie didn't take itself too seriously, but then the second part came, and it started being a real super-hero movie, and, for a few minutes, boring) that it also contains. But when you see so many ignorant messages in such acclaimed movies like ""Avatar"", in this movie industry, that seems full of stupid people with diluted ideas, it was a relief that in the end of the movie they didn't say ""Save the green!"" or any of that childish crap.<br/><br/>It's the story of Dave Lizewski (Johnson), an unnoticed high school student and comic book fan with a few friends and who lives alone with his father. His life is not very difficult and his personal trials not that overwhelming. However, one day he makes the simple decision to become a super-hero even though he has no powers or training. <br/><br/>Right in the first sequences you can see that this movie is different than the others, probably because of it's style (That can be great sometimes), and narrative technique. The direction is mostly great. The action scenes and extremely well shot, except for the one where Hit-Girl use the night vision in the warehouse (It looked more like if we were watching someone playing ""Doom""). The violence in this movie is well put sometimes, but at other times, very disturbing (And i'm not easily disturbed).<br/><br/>The screenplay is far from being great... Maybe it's good, but not something that improves the movie, on the contrary, it can ruin the movie if you look in some different points of view, but there is one thing that it really appreciated about the script... Right in the beginning we can see how dangerous Frank is, which was not present in other movies like ""Ocean's Eleven"" where Andy Garcia (The bad guy) spends the whole movie without killing a single person. Following the same grade, is the acting, that is great sometimes (Chloe Moretz, Mark Strong), sometimes good (Nicholas Cage, Aaron Johnson), and occasionally bad (Christopher Mintz-Plasse).<br/><br/>Another thing that stood out in the picture was that the movie looks cartoonish, without trying to be it every time, in this aspect, it works better than ""Sin City"", but not as good as ""Spider-Man"".<br/><br/>Verdict: Some may find it offensive, and I kind of understand them, but there is no doubt that this movie is entertaining, well directed and well acted, and worth watching."
"NativeProtestor","10","2","11","2 May 2010"," Liberals will hate this movie
","I have a theory why some critics have given this movie such a low rating and it has nothing to do with the age of the actors.<br/><br/>Liberals all over the world despise the gun culture in the US because it is against government control. Most liberals have a knee-jerk reaction to anything that promotes guns. I think one of the reasons some critics are trashing this movie is because it has a lot gun violence and it is completely unapologetic about it.<br/><br/>The directors of this movie were obviously not concerned about political correctness, which is why it is so good. ""Big Daddy"" and ""Hit Girl"" love their guns. Even worse, they show absolutely no remorse for brutally killing bad guys with those guns. Ebert said it was ridiculous how ""Hit Girl"" and ""Big Daddy"" showed no remorse after killing criminals. That's a valid point. But in a funny way that's exactly what makes their characters so compelling. They are not bleeding-heart liberals who cry every time a brutal criminal is killed. They know their victims are evil and they are determined to make them pay for their crimes. How refreshing.<br/><br/>""Kick-Ass"" is also a very compelling character. One of the best parts of the movie is when a criminal asks him, ""Kid, are you ready to die for this stranger?"" Kick-Ass answers, ""Yes, I am"". Kick-Ass loves justice so much that he is ready to sacrifice his own life to achieve it. Unlike other celebrities who become famous because of their appearance and talent, ""Kick-Ass"" becomes famous because of his self-sacrifice. <br/><br/>I understand that Kick-Ass is a parody of superhero movies, just like Kill Bill was a parody of 70's Kung-Fu movies. But even though these movies are laughing at some of the more absurd aspects of the genres they are parodying, they are also celebrating their themes. Even though the characters in Kick-Ass are absurd, and maybe even a little crazy, they still have all those characteristics that makes us want to be superheroes ourselves: a determination to punish evil, an unhesitating commitment to justice, and a willingness to sacrifice themselves for the greater good."

It also has elements of a Coming of Age movie in it. I loved how Aaron Johnson's character matured over the course of the story. I really enjoyed Chloe Moretz's performance.

Counter that with a bitter and twisted patriarch grooming his daughter for death, mayhem and destruction and you have an almost perfect movie, one that kept me watching throughout! The balance is perfect keeping enough comic book nuance but always grounded in the real world where no one really can fly, catch speeding bullets or climb vertical walls with impunity. There is not one wasted line and the director gets great performances out of all involved. It looks like it was a hoot to make and for me, it was a hoot and a half to watch.

"pyrocitor","9","2","11","28 April 2010"," As apt and representative a title as any
","To paraphrase Zoolander: ""Superheroes - they're so hot right now"". And perhaps it is its chasing such a tide of success that makes Matthew Vaughn's Kick-Ass - part introspective examination of the 'real world' angle of superheroism and part joyful addition to the genre crammed with enough violence and questionable content to gleefully rattle the bars of political correctness - vaguely less remarkable than had it been released five to ten years prior. This is not to say that the quality of an otherwise outstanding movie is lowered simply due to the year of its release date (to fail to appreciate the comedic marvel that is Vaughn's film would be a spoiled audience indeed) but rather that the popularity of the genre which procured a mass release for such edgy material also somewhat does it a disservice in the sense of setting a standard one inevitably hopes the film will supersede, perhaps unrealistically. <br/><br/>As such, those anticipating Kick-Ass providing thematic ruminations on the pros and cons of comic book culture and the repercussions of heroism in a 'real', internet age to exceed (or even equal) those of other such reflexive texts such as Watchmen may be disappointed. While the film introduces many such queries, they are often left under-explored, leaving the film feeling somewhat thematically weak as well as not quite managing to 'say' anything exceptionally innovative in reference to its genre. <br/><br/>But let's be honest - one would be hard pressed finding the average audience member to lamenting the lack of truly in-depth genre existentialism to the point of ignoring kinetic fight scenes, and such notions as theme, while interesting, feel largely incidental in favour of the film's sense of high-octane fun. Kick-Ass is a film which truly delivers what it promises, from carrying over the glorious carnage and hilarity of its preview material to living up to its title. Nonetheless, as riotously enjoyable as the film is, such a quality does again provide a niggling complaint - the film is awesome, granted, but always just as awesome as one would expect, rather than truly taking audiences off guard or pushing the envelope well past the point of hype. You do get what you pay for, for better or for worse.<br/><br/>Thankfully, what you pay for is almost resoundingly for better. Despite a slow start in which the film riffs a touch too obviously on established superhero films (particularly Sam Raimi's Spider-Man), toeing the line of 'Epic Movie' style winks at times, Vaughn quickly finds his momentum and subsequently ramps up the pace, mayhem and fun to satisfying overdrive. With a fascinating colour aesthetic (contrasting the murky greys and browns of the city with the Crayola Technicolour of the heroes) and delightfully whimsical and effective musical score (often setting brutal violence or slapstick humour to classical music, achieving an innovative stylistic deadpan) and a snappy script keeping the tone lively, Vaughn's film demonstrates plenty to love and appreciate. <br/><br/>But then come the fight scenes. Whirling cascades of intricate choreography, gritty brutality (particularly Kick-Ass' first attempts at combating crime) and blazing gunfire (particularly jarring for a superhero film) intertwining to become some of the most simultaneously cathartic, uncomfortable yet gleefully fun violent interludes in recent cinema, managing to both mock and relish the sadistic fun of movie violence, and ramping up to one of the most ludicrously enjoyable final payoff showdowns in ages. Kick- Ass could almost function as an exploration of the role and purpose of cinematic violence as much as comic book culture, but whether treated as probing or entertaining, Vaughn's hard- hitting tone is exceedingly difficult to shake or to not enjoy.<br/><br/>Particular quality is extracted from the film's magnificent cast, as charismatic rising star Aaron Johnson effortlessly delivers overblown goofiness while remaining intensely likable as the titular Kick-Ass, warmly centring the film whether as exasperated nerd or wide-eyed superhero. Christopher Mintz-Plasse adds a welcome wounded resentment to his customary gawky cockiness as spoiled rich kid superhero Red Mist, and the reliable Mark Strong offers another creation of credibly stern villainy. However, the film's real triumph lies in its unlikely background heroes. Nicholas Cage shreds expectations with sublimely hilarious work as Batman-ripoff heroic patriarch 'Big Daddy', his performance pitched perfectly between manic hysteria and hokey charm (and a voice deliciously pantomiming Adam West's unforgettable fragmented Batman dialect). Equally, Chloe Grace Moretz is a comedic revelation, stealing the show as hard-as-nails vigilante Hit-Girl, and never failing to astound with exactly how far her role will push the boundaries of political correctness. Vaughn also collects a bevy of background players who deliver compelling characterisations for a change, the only exception being Lyndsy Fonseca as Kick-Ass' romantic interest, who, despite a charming performance, feels like an ultimately mishandled and incidental character, decentring the film's emotional arc somewhat. <br/><br/>Wild, wacky and daring, Kick-Ass triumphs through managing to dredge up genuine heart, exhilaration and sentiment in the midst of occasional contrivance or excessive convention. A definitive comment on or twist of the superhero genre? Not quite. An enormous array of pulsating, tremendous fun (ultimately the point of the picture)? A vehement and blood- spattered ""HELL YES""! <br/><br/>-8.5/10"
"beatnick49","8","2","11","27 April 2010"," It delivers, deconstructs and made me laugh
","Some critics and viewers have criticised Kick Ass, because of the character Hit Girl, for her swearing and (to a lesser degree) violence. I personally think Hit Girl is awesome (the daughter of Lisbeth Salander and Dexter Morgan), and I also think the criticisms miss the point.<br/><br/>Kick Ass is advertised as an outright, slapstick comedy, with a simple story, when it is really a dark comedy/satire which (as a friend put it) deconstructs the superhero mythos. Still, this movie had plenty of moments that made me laugh. The guy leaping from the building, Kick Ass's crush on his teacher, Hit Girl's joke on Big Daddy, the car scene, and others.<br/><br/>The characters are mostly really likable. Kick Ass has decided that he will stuff what others think, and he will help out people in trouble. Even though it comes at a price, he continues. Hit Girl and Big Daddy just want to take down the mafia, fix what the law has failed to do, and avenge the lady who was Hit Girls mum and Big Daddy's wife. These are things that many of us have probably wanted to do, and thought about doing.<br/><br/>Another success of Kick is it's (as a friend put it) deconstruction of the superhero myth. Watchmen created inverted versions of DC superheroes and villains (The Comedian/Joker), and looked at how the world might treat masked, skilled vigilantes and super powered humans, if they actually existed. Kick Ass rather looks at how real, average humans would get by if they became masked vigilantes. Kick Ass is stabbed and hit by a car, Hit Girl loses her father, and Big Daddy loses his life. Kick Ass and Hit Girl do not come out of this unscathed.<br/><br/>The movie is also a satire of society's attraction to violence, and it's satire of itself. During the torture scene, the TV stops airing it. The viewers, despite, being disturbed at the scene, race to the internet to see it. It could be seen as sending itself up. It's as though the makers knew the movie was going to be controversial, because of the violence, but people would go in, aware of what they in for.<br/><br/>The next success is Hit Girl. She really steals the whole thing, and that is a good thing. She is a break from the monopoly of swearing being the monopoly of boys. She is tough, confident, and...well kick ass. They way she skewers the crims is fantastic. People who criticise the movie simply for the fact she is a violent, swearing 11 year old, just don't gell with me. It's their opinion and they're entitled to it. But really, what age is appropriate to mutilate people and drop the c bomb? The criticisms hypocritical, the boy in Role Models swore like a trooper (with the F bomb) and I heard nobody complain.<br/><br/>As a comic book fan, and movie goer I really liked this movie. Bad guys get chopped, the movie takes shots at itself, Hit Girl is fantastic, and it's funny. I had a real good time with this film."
"Mash-the-stampede","8","2","11","27 April 2010"," ""Kick-ass"" kicked ass!
","Had ""Watchmen"" not existed I would say that this is a very unique and original take on the 'Superhero' mythos and in many ways it still is, besides all the cliché's and stereo-types, ""Kick-Ass"" some how still feels fresh and original and really makes super-heroism or vigilantism realistic and relevant for todays times. If somebody really did put on a wetsuit and a mask and starting fighting thugs on the street, you bet your arse somebody would video that and stick it on 'YouTube'! Instant fame! A trend would start and before you know it, more vigilantes or ""heroes"" would show up for sure. The cast is absolutely brilliant in their roles and i must say ""Kick Ass"" is a welcome return to form for Nicholas cage who's films of late have seriously been sucking a whole lot. His character ""Batma...."" oops, I mean ""Big daddy"" is brilliantly acted and portrayed with just the right mix of campiness and seriousness that it works so well and makes for one of the strongest characters in the film. His daughter and side-kick ""Hit-girl"" is a psychotic 12 year old girl who swears like a trooper (drops the ol' C-bomb numerous times) and brutally kills villains without so much as a blink of an eye! Her scenes make for all the films best action sequences without a doubt! Aaron Johnson who played the title character of ""Kick-Ass"" is an actor of whom I'm not familiar with so I had no previous expectations to go by which was good as I felt his acting was fine and worked well for the character he played. The crazy thing about ""Kick-ass"" which will either be it's downfall or it's saving grace is that it's a mixed bag of genre's going from typical superhero adventure film, to side-splitting ""superbad"" style humour to overly violent gore fest to serious dead-pan scenes....it works for the most part and is definitely worth a watch for anybody who likes violent films....or comedies....or superhero films.....or action films....or dramatic films......(you get where I'm going with this). <br/><br/>In short; ""Kick-Ass"" kicked ass!!!"

","Kick-Ass is a cool film and even more than cool it tries to be an excellent movie which is highly commendable especially if you take into account the dross that makes it to our screens sometimes. It shows that people who are talented and committed to providing the goods can shine through. That said what this film lacks is a tone, not knowing what it wants to be at its core, a teen flick, a spiderman/batman flick, a comedy, a hard core action, a character study about parenthood? It also shows in the soundtrack which has a general messiness about it. Having said all of this, what does work is the characters they are interesting and involving and the action is brutal, painful and yes sometimes fun!

"dtucker86","Null","2","11","19 April 2010"," Very original
","I have sometimes thought that Hollywood has run out of ideas and its screenwriters lack originality. This movie is a change of pace for sure, because it is original. They say that even that unlikeliest person can become a hero and Aaron Johnson's character Dave (Kick Ass) is sure a case in point. He's a loser who has a girl that likes him only because she thinks he's gay and pities him. He lives in a world of comic book fantasy and decides to become a superhero like one of his make believe idols. This despite the fact that he has no super powers whatsoever. You admire this kid's good hearted nature but can't help but laugh as he gets the crap beat out of him! Nicholas Cage's character says it to him best, your name should be ass kick. Cage gives a delightfully quirky, eccentric performance as big daddy in this film. He would have been the last actor I would have picked to play a superhero but he steals the show as does young Chloe Moretz as his daughter and fellow crime fighter Hit Girl. She's so lucky to have him for a father, my goodness he shoots her in the chest twice while she's wearing a bulletproof vest to toughen her up. If all parents were so caring. My goodness, little Chloe must have had a ball making this film. She gets to curse like a sailor and kill over thirty bad guys with knives and guns to the theme music of the old Bannana Splits show. This movie has enough gunfights and explosions in it for three movies. I would have loved to have seen their special effects budget. Kick Ass is sort of like Spiderman directed by Quentin Tarentino."
"freaky_dave","8","2","11","18 April 2010"," Bloody fun
","I've heard some people complaining about this movie because it involves a little girl who curses and kills bad guys at random. We have to take into consideration that this is a comic book satire, and is not meant to be taken seriously. It is rated R for a reason because little kids are not suppose to be watching it. The only problem I have with any of this is the parents that would take their small children to see this. That is completely wrong. Now here's my review.<br/><br/>I found Kick Ass to be hysterical and over the top. It reminded me a lot of Kill Bill 1 and 2, and I enjoyed those two movies as well. The killings in Kick Ass are graphic and appalling, but that's what the film is meant to be, a graphic description of a comic book series. I can include the movie Sin City, another good film, in this as well, and I can tell you that both Kill Bill films and Sin City are much more bloodier than Kick Ass. I don't understand the opinions from critics, most of whom enjoyed the Kill Bill movies and Sin City, who find that Kick Ass is a little too much for their tastes. That is being hypocritical, and that is not the way a critic should review any movies.<br/><br/>THe acting for the most part was well done. Nicolas Cage hams it up and does a good job while not taking the material seriously. I got a sense that he was copying Adam West from the old Batman series in the 60s, and he does a fine job. Aaron Johnson, who plays Kick Ass, reminded me a lot of Tobey Maguire in the Spider-Man movies in the way he handled his part. Both Mark Strong (Frank D'Amico) and Christopher Mintz-Plasse (Chris D'Amico/Red Mist) have good supporting roles, but the person that real grabbed most of my interest was Chloe Moretz, who play Hit Girl. Whenever she appears, no matter if she is just talking or kicking ass, she takes the role and runs with it, and just about takes over the movie where we nearly forget about the character of Kick Ass.<br/><br/>Kick Ass is an entertaining movie that grabbed my interest from the beginning, and never grows dull. THe humor is there along with all the blood shed. It is an insane film that keeps you watching until the end. It is not a great film, but I wasn't expecting it to be. It was just the type of action movie that we don't see much of anymore, even if the killer, most of the time, is an eleven year old girl."
"WHYeat","10","2","11","18 April 2010"," Perfect. A Must-See
","My top movies include Dark Knight, V for Vendetta and now Kick-Ass. I'm not a huge comic book fan, but they do tell great stories and their graphical nature translates beautifully on screen. They make excellent screenplays, and Kick-Ass is exemplary.<br/><br/>Kick-Ass differentiates itself from all the other graphic-novels and the movies thereafter. It's funny and it's action-packed, but the great thing is that this isn't a story about superheros. It's a story about someone who says, ""Enough is enough."" Kick-Ass is tired of people standing by and watching others become victims. Instead of helping, people whip out their phones to make a YouTube video. Fear. It consumes us. For Kick-Ass, his fear takes a back seat to naivety and wishful thinking. Thus a ""superhero"" is born.<br/><br/>The other great thing is this isn't a kid's movie. It's rated R. Rightfully so. Even though there's GREAT comedic content - this movie is hilarious - it also has serious, gritty, adult content. The only reason to take the kids is to show them that being a superhero is no picnic. It's definitely not for everyone. I was surprised by the amount of violence, but it's nothing today's kids can't handle I suppose...<br/><br/>It takes every fiber of my body to not dish out the fantastic detail, but I want to keep this spoiler-free and let you enjoy this great film - the first must-see movie of the year and one of my new personal favorites.<br/><br/>I also review chick flicks @ RatedChick.com"
"Apemangalore","9","2","11","18 April 2010"," One of the funnest movie-going experiences I've had in awhile
","Being based on a beloved comic book series, and as a film that redefines what a super hero movie, specifically, should be, Kick-Ass would make for quite the companion piece to last year's Watchmen. It's a film that will assuredly offend many more people than it already has. If you manage to get past that, however, what you'll find is a piece of cinema that's pure fun.<br/><br/>Let me say, first and foremost, that Kick-Ass has a terrific ensemble. Aaron Johnson, who – as others have mentioned – will likely end up being overshadowed by other cast members, as great as the titular character. This is a character that, with even the slightest bit of mishandling, could've come off as pretty unlikable, but Johnson captures that perfect blend of awkwardness and badassness. Christopher Mintz-Plasse also delivers a surprisingly resonating performance as Red Mist; the days of him being simply known as McLovin' are over.<br/><br/>The real stars of this movie, however, are Nicolas Cage and Chloë Moretz as Big Daddy and Hit Girl, respectively, the former having officially redeemed himself for his performance in Ghost Rider. I won't say much for the sake of spoilers, but there's some brilliant stuff that only Cage could do with that character. As for Moretz, this is a career-making performance from her. Her introduction alone will go down as one of the great character intros. And even while committing such horrible acts of violence, she strangely manages to capture that sense of childlike innocence. It's something else, to say the least.<br/><br/>Speaking of violence (most of which done either to or by children), this is easily one of the bloodiest, nastiest mainstream movies to hit theaters in some time. Even as somebody who's watched all of the Saw movies (to give a more recent example), there were a couple of scenes that I just wasn't prepared for. That being said, the action is fast-paced, yet – thankfully – not so frenetic that you can't understand what the hell's going on, and there are some real nail-biting moments during the film's stirring climax.<br/><br/>Amidst all of the mayhem that goes on in Kick-Ass, however, there is some real human drama to be found here as well. The film definitely succeeds in getting you to sympathize with Dave, and by the time he's doing what's expected from a guy with an alter-ego named Kick-Ass, you're cheering him on. The film then equally as well succeeds in making you hate the villain, Frank D'Amico, played by Mark Strong. This isn't a guy who, right before killing you, will present you with some long, drawn-out monologue, he'll just kill you. And by the time the aforementioned climax rolls around, you see just how despicable this guy really is.<br/><br/>Kick-Ass is the most fun that I've had at the movies in a while. Just about everything in this movie works, from the Superbad-esquire humor, to the often over-the-top action sequences, to the surprisingly believable cast of characters. And hey, I managed to get through this whole review without saying ""Kick-Ass kicks ass,"" even though I'd really like to."
"Harlemer","9","2","11","17 April 2010"," A Fantastic Joyride
","I have to say, out of all the technicalities that make a movie good, you never really think of ""editing."" But in all seriousness, the editing of this flick is so great, that even if it had horrible characters or plot, I'd still want to see it again.<br/><br/>Thankfully that's not the case. Kick-ass has a ton of fun characters, my favorite of which are the father and daughter (Big Daddy and Hit Girl). They all have an array of quirks that don't overwhelm their whole presence, and they all play off one another very well in a darkly humorous plot. That being said, the only problem I had with this movie was that it may have been too serious. It's a satire movie with very few laugh-out-loud jokes, but it doesn't make it any less enjoyable. I went into the movie expecting a boatload of jokes, but ended up getting a surprisingly dark experience. But it doesn't stop the fact that this is a fun movie from start to finish.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this is the Zombieland of super hero flicks.

","Kick-Ass should really be called Hit Girl because she pretty much saves the movie and kind of inspires people around her to be stronger and badass, she steals every scene. At first I thought that this movie was a little uneven when it came to balancing laughs and hardcore violence and some of the jokes worked for me and some didn't even put a smirk on my face and it was pretty childish and over the top for the most part but everyones inner nerds fantasies are fulfilled and then some. In the beginning also I really didn't buy or take anything seriously in this film and thought to myself when are you guys going to back up the title instead of being dorky and strange, then Hit Girl comes and saves the day. When the ass kicking starts it comes in full and glorious fury with a action packed finale that was worth the wait and price of admission and that's when it earns it's name and my approval of being Kick-Ass! Overall it's very refreshing to see young kids and teenagers without superhuman powers kicking some major ass and becoming the mysterious superheroes it's almost controversial seeing them shed some blood and that's why I love it even more because it's kind of ballsy but it's pretty much a love it or hate it type of film. I say shut up, get off your ass and see Kick-Ass which will probably be the most fun time at the movies you'll have this year. More of a 3.5 out of 5 stars. BRING ON THE SEQUEL!!!!"
"vincent-janse","10","2","11","16 April 2010"," you guys it kicks Spidy in the ass!!
","the reason why I gave this movie a 9 is, because even though the trailer of the movie made it look as if it was a mediocre but funny parody on all the bad super hero movies of our time. It was actually seriously KICK ASS.<br/><br/>The movie was refreshingly good and has a 10 for originality and had a better plot than most super hero movies(batman was still better of course). The plot was really cool because it mixed complete absurdity with realistic events and even tough the whole movie was unrealistic you really get sucked as if your a little kid looking at your first action movie ever. but the action and violence in this movie is better then in any other SHM(super hero movie) I have ever see. I think its pity that the movie was marketed as a marvel parody the first scene in the movie implies it by putting the text MARV big on the screen.Which is stupid because its nothing like a parody and it doesn't do movie any justice ."

","Dave Lizewski is an unnoticed high school student and comic book fan with a few friends and who lives alone with his father. <br/><br/>His life is not very difficult and his personal trials not that overwhelming. <br/><br/>However, one day he makes the simple decision to become a super-hero even though he has no powers or training...<br/><br/>This movie feels like it's been a long time coming, I was even worried at one point that the film would ever get released. How glad I am that this film is getting the hype and the coverage it's getting at the moment.<br/><br/>From the upstart, Kick-Ass is a clever, funny, and bittersweet movie, that has so much in common with the films it's 'complimenting' than you would expect. But obviously Kick-Ass has no special powers, which is the novel part of the film, but he loses someone close at an early age, has an accident that 'changes' him in someway, a girl he finds attractive but does not know how to approach, the villain, and of course the gaining of self confidence.<br/><br/>Some of the film is very close to the knuckle, and will probably get a few complaints from the stiffs who don't know how to read a movie properly and have a good time. For instance, when Big Daddy shoots Hit-Girl at point blank range, is in bad taste, but it got the biggest laugh in the cinema, and on the subject of Hit-Girl, she is easily the most likable character in the whole film, even though she has been brainwashed and been devoid of a childhood.<br/><br/>Another thing this has in common with other movies it 'compliments', the main character is put in the back seat for the majority of the time in favour of supporting characters. Plasse as Red-Mist is more serious and evil than the trailer suggests, and pits in a great performance. Strong is good, but sadly wasted as the main villain, but he is really great and is as watchable as always, it's just people familiar with Strong know he has done better before.<br/><br/>Cage gives the best performance he has in nearly ten years, his Big Daddy coming as a cross between Ned Flanders, Patrick Bateman, and The Punisher, even though he isn't in it much, he steals the show whenever he is in it.<br/><br/>The action is frenetic and visceral, but the soundtrack makes the violence just that little more lighter on the eyes. <br/><br/>The narrative is brilliant, and everything just goes along at such a good pace, that you never get bored of it.<br/><br/>Leaving the film open for a sequel is good, but predictable, but mixing the comedy with crushingly dark undertones about loss, makes it a little more emotional.<br/><br/>A great movie, probably the best film released so far this year, and destined to become a cult phenomenon.<br/><br/>See it before everyone starts quoting line to you on the street."

","Not too long ago, in a galaxy that now seems incredibly far away, Lionsgate unleashed some of the grimiest, most unabashedly un-PC films into mainstream theatres (""Saw"", ""High Tension,"" and ""The Devil's Rejects"" immediately come to mind); as a result, the studio gained a favorable reputation among genre loyalists looking for cheap thrills delivered by up-and-coming talent. It would seem that ""Kick-Ass"" (whose ostentatious title is culled from a comic-book series I have not read), the tale of a dorky high-schooler with aspirations of superhero grandeur, would fit well into the ""cheap thrills"" department...but instead becomes an astonishingly unfunny punchline unto itself. Ignoring the fact that the film is a tonally inconsistent mess (dark, 'outrageous' humor -- a little girl who blows away henchmen twice her size! -- is mashed between sloppily-choreographed action scenes and agonizingly pretentious teen-talk), it flat-out fails in its central conceit: that even a dorky high-schooler who dons an obnoxious green wetsuit can be elevated to Living Legend status (with the reliable help of faux-hype instigators like MySpace!). Truth be told, Kick-Ass does little of note for the duration of this miserable slog, and the inclusion of other not-so-super heroes (including a lame Batman caricature essayed by an insufferably lame Nicolas Cage) only further muddies what little focus this film has. It also doesn't help that the main villain is standard-issue cipher, a dime-a-dozen mob boss we've seen too many times before. Did I mention that this whole ordeal crawls toward the close-to-two hour mark? Perhaps I'm just missing the point of ""Kick-Ass""...unless its point is riddled with the kind of whip-smart irony that led me to the following conclusion: with the right kind of moxie, obnoxiousness, and low-rent business savvy, those among us who are most unworthy of attention (but possess a loud enough mouth to voice their vapid opinions with confidence) can launch themselves into a grotesque parody of celebrity without really DOING anything. With ""Kick-Ass,"" the exponentially lowered expectations for super-heroes translates into a new icon for the Facebook Generation. Pathetic."
"thefinisher_23","10","2","12","27 April 2010"," Most Self-Explanatory title ever?
","Director Matthew Vaughn's ""Kick-Ass"" isn't a spoof of a superhero film at all. Rather it is its' own superhero film. It gives us a lead who wants to be a superhero not because of some higher calling, or a tragedy that would derail most of us but instead is given about 45 seconds of screen time. Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) is just looking for a little purpose in life. He's a comic book nut to boot and so he dons a green wet suit and is off to disrupt some petty crime in New York City. It's from here the movie takes off, spiraling into dark satire, hysterical parallels, gritty and gory action, etc. Did I mention it also features one of the most controversial and entertaining characters in cinema history? Dave's a pretty normal guy. He pines after Katie (Lyndsy Fonseca), has a pair of funny but dorky best friends (Clark Duke of ""Hot Tub Time Machine"" among them), and makes deposits in a certain warehouse. Once he takes up the mantra of ""kick-ass"" he finds himself way over his head. After all he's not Bruce Wayne or Clark Kent. This has shades of ""Watchmen"" in it. If normal people take up the title of a costumed vigilante they're just still human. The costume is a persona and a representation of an ideal. It's not who they are. Dave meets a father-daughter pair who could care less. Big Daddy (Nicholas Cage) looks oddly like Batman and his daughter Hit-Girl (Chloe Moretz) has been raised to make the Dark Knight look about as threatening as Katherine Hiegl. Why would he raise her so? The movie gives a perverted sort of explanation that makes sense in some odd way. The pair are after Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong) a ruthless mob boss. This mob boss has a son who soon goes by the name of ""Red Mist"" (Christopher Mintz-Plasse). Is he a ruthless youngster like his dad or does he simply admire his papa? The answers all come one way or another.<br/><br/>In case you didn't guess Dave is in way over his head. His romance and motivations mean nothing once he realizes just what his adopted profession actually entails. That seems to be the general point of ""Kick-Ass"". Superheroes can't exist in the real world because what they strive to do is simply impossible. To oust organized crime syndicates and real world crisis's is the job of many men and women, not three extraordinary individuals. The appeal of a film like this is that it's set in the real world. Dave doesn't triumph in his first outings as a comic-book icon. In fact one is downright traumatic. His sobering presence in the film gives it the grounding it needs with the likes of Big Daddy, Hit-Girl and D'Amico shocking their way across the screen.<br/><br/>Now for the issue of ""Hit-Girl"". If someone were to say they hated the film or couldn't watch it because of her you really can't argue with them. Her character is violent, so mature and the very thought of a pre-teen doing what she does is so scary that present a mountain of moral dilemma? Is it wrong for someone to write her character in such a harsh yet humorous way? What's the point of her character? What about her dad? Best not to think of it all that way. She's a walking, talking, punching, kicking, shooting, swearing send-off of the genre. You want outrageous? Rorsarach would blush. You want sinister and threatening? The Joker would be at a loss for words. In a genre where disbelief must be put on-ice for hours at a time Hit-Girl is its' ultimate symbol. Forget about the fact that she utters the ""C"" word with the frequency of Joe Pesci, or that she has the maturity of 30 year old Soviet sniper, or that her daddy time is spent both at a bowling alley and taking slugs in the her Kevlar-protected chest. She's killing the bad guys and that's all that matters in a superhero film. The aspect of morality only matters if the good guys don't have it because we know the villains don't.<br/><br/>Any film is nothing without it's' performances. Superhero films are especially vulnerable in this area. ""Kick-Ass"" provides us with a cast that knew exactly what movie they were making and how they were supposed to fit into it. Cage is at his best here. He brings a controlled intensity to his best roles and Big Daddy is no different. As cool and ferocious as he is you can't help but be totally taken aback by him. Johnson is perfect as the not-to-vulnerable lead. His angst is presented with both hilarity and honesty. Mintz-Plasse will forever be known as ""McLovin"" but his character has some real depth here. He wants to follow in his father's footsteps but does he really know what his dad does, and once he figures out will that change? The film gives a classic answer. Then there is issue of his dad played by Mark Strong. He is fast becoming his generations' definitive villain-actor. He was sinister and stout in ""Sherlock Holmes"" but he's a downright a****** here. That's a compliment Mark, can't wait to see you in ""Robin Hood"".<br/><br/>I don't claim to be a comic-book geek but I get giddy over any great film. ""Kick-Ass"" is just that. It belongs in the pantheon with ""Batman Begins"", ""The Dark Knight"", ""Spider-Man 2"", ""X2"" and ""Watchmen."" Those films all chose to deal with their conflicts both real and fantasy with ferocious action and well-written and serious plot points. ""Kick-Ass"" certainly succeeds as an action film but never forgets just outrageous it is. The result is something affecting, shocking, thrilling and funny.

","I reluctantly went to see Kick Ass after hearing much hype about it from my friends about how they heard it was awesome. After leaving the film my friends and I generated the same response. It was a good movie with a few good laughs and some cool action scenes, but it no way did it deserve to be in the top 250 movies of all time on this website or any other for that matter. It had a mediocre plot and an okay script, but there is just something about a 12 year old cussing people out that kind of bothers me? I understand it is a movie and sometimes her lines were funny, but it was just awkward. A few one liners kept the laughs chugging along little by little, but overall everyone who's actually seen it says the same thing that it was pretty good nothing special and I agree. Comedy is getting lost now because apparently the new hilarious moments occur when the f word just flies all over the place. Cool effects though at times stupid sequences. It was a fun movie but overall it didn't deliver everything I thought it would."
"rockinkettles-1","8","2","12","17 April 2010"," A Kick Ass Good Time!!
","Kick Ass definitely wasn't what I expected. This is not your typical super hero movie. It is rated R for good reason. It is more adult themed and not for kids. The title character is a teenage boy who wonders why no one ever tries to become a real super hero so he decides to become one himself. The gem of the movie is Hit Girl, an eleven year old girl who kicks major ass! She puts Kick Ass, the super hero to shame! Nicholas Cage plays Big Daddy, a sort of Batman super hero who uses guns. He is Hit Girl's father. His outfit kind of resembles Batman. Cage does a funny take on the old Batman of the 60's. He talks like Adam West did on the show. To me, Kick Ass is a cross between the old Batman series of the 60's, Kill Bill and Scarface! I'm not kidding! There is one great action scene with Hit Girl where the theme song from Banana Splits is played in the background. The ending is bang pow action that is straight out of Scarface. Hit Girl has some of the best lines. She steals the movie every time she is on screen with her quick moves, throwing knives and shooting guns at the bad guys. It isn't what you normally see a young girl doing in a movie but then Kick Ass isn't your normal action film...So, this is one movie that is not to be missed. You will find yourself laughing at the dark humor and cheering. I certainly hope there is a Kick Ass 2!"

","I'm typing this review now even though this movie came out four years back, as I have just gotten an IMDb account. That being said, I just had to write a review for it.<br/><br/>When I first saw Kick-Ass previews, I expected little more than a critical failure like many comic book adaptations. As reviews began pouring in, I decided to give it a shot. This was one of the best cinematic decisions I have made.<br/><br/>First off, it is extremely R rated. F bombs left and right, tons of gore, and all around adult content. This made it extremely funny albeit vulgar, as well as extremely entertaining.<br/><br/>Second is the score. I don't know what it is but it is one of the best scores I have ever heard. Catchy, epic, and at times chilling, it makes for a perfect atmosphere for a superhero trying to find himself.<br/><br/>The movie is quite comical, yet surprisingly takes a rather epic, and serious turn as it progresses. This made me come away from the movie much more impacted than I would expect. My friends have grown tired of me talking about how good it is, and I recommend everyone to watch it. 10/10"

","I really feel like I shouldn't bother writing this. It's nearly 2013 and I've only just got round to watching Kick Ass. Since it was released everyone I've ever spoken to about it (and I speak to most people about films!) has said how great it is.<br/><br/>I should leave the review there, with the words ""Everyone says it's great.""<br/><br/>However, it just left me cold. There was something about it I didn't get. I thought it was going to be funnier. It's not that funny. It's also not action-packed enough to be an action film. The action is over-the-top as if it's trying to be silly, but 'silly' and 'action' don't really go together for me.<br/><br/>That's about it from me. I didn't like it. I didn't like the characters. I didn't like the action or the attempts to crowbar some drama into something that's, for the most part, trying to be silly and take off the superhero genre. But I'm definitely the minority. Like I say, everyone else I've ever spoken to loved this.<br/><br/>For the record, I also don't like Bladerunner or the Godfather. I can't tell you why either."
"Latvic","6","1","4","7 October 2014"," Entertaining but problematic
","Some movies get better with time, some movies get worse. Case in point, 2010's Kick- Ass. When I first saw the film, when it was playing theaters, I thought it was amazing. I thought it was a daring, original and groundbreaking entry in the comic book movie genre. Now that I've seen it again, for the first time in about two years, I definitely have to paddle back a little bit.<br/><br/>The idea of a superhero movie set in the supposedly real world (or as real as the movies can get) was quite new at the time. And so the first scene of the movie sets up exactly that premise perfectly in a darkly comic way, when a self-proclaimed superhero plunges off a building, just to fall to his bloody death, all accompanied by the narration of the titular Kick- Ass aka Dave Lizewski, played by Aaron Johnson. He is a perfectly average high schooler, so average that he himself admits to not be the smartest, not the funniest, not the best at anything. And even though we don't know it yet at that point in the movie, but this is the first problem the film has, its main character. But let's look at the plot first, shall we?<br/><br/>Dave, one day while hanging out with his nerdy friends at the comic book store, asks himself why there are no superheroes in real life, why nobody has ever attempted to fight crime as a masked vigilante. So off he goes, buys himself a bright green and yellow scuba suit and goes out on the street to become his alter ego, Kick-Ass. What then follows is a nice sendup of all the obligatory training montages we've seen in films like Sam Raimi's Spider-Man. It's at that point that we are introduced to the highlights of the movie, Nicolas Cage and Chloë Grace Moretz as father-daughter duo Big Daddy and Hit-Girl. When Kick- Ass becomes a crime fighting sensation thanks to his inability to feel pain after a bad car accident, Big Daddy, Hit-Girl and him team up to fight crime lord Frank d'Amico, played reliably with his usual villain stick by Mark Strong.<br/><br/>If I had to summarize the film in one word, it would be schizophrenic. It has two personalities, all the way through. While the first half does a fairly good job of parodying its genre, the second half succumbs to the tired genre tropes it so desperately wants to persiflage. The taste of formula right there is especially unpleasant, given the potential it fully delved into previously. The depiction of violence is another problem. There is an odd juxtaposition between cartoonish violence, such as when d'Amico's goons microwave a guy who then explodes into a giant bloody pulp, and a more realistic, and quite nasty, take on violence. Just watch the scene when Nicolas Cage's character gets horribly burnt to death (Hello spoilers!), that will definitely leave a bad taste in your mouth. And the sad part is, the film doesn't do a good job of presenting the heroes as the good guys. Either way, the villains and heroes are using the most brutal ways to hurt and kill each other, and it's hard to root for somebody when both sides' gritty methods of execution are indistinguishable from each other. Playing wildly catchy music over Hit-Girl's slicing people's limbs off is simply not enough to convince us that our heroes are doing the right thing. The movie's complete lack of reflection upon bloody killings really does stick out like a sore thumb. One can't help but start sounding like an old fart who complains that movies nowadays brainlessly celebrate violence and make it look cool.<br/><br/>And I haven't even got started on my initially mentioned problem with our title character. Kick-Ass is so limited in his abilities, so bland as a character that he seems to disintegrate into the background every time another person is on screen with him. Again, since it is even mentioned in the dialogue how completely average he is, maybe it was all intentional, and Aaron Johnson is not a mediocre actor but is simply brilliant at being mediocre.<br/><br/>These are all major flaws and you might think that I completely dislike Kick-Ass but let me tell you, you couldn't be further from the truth. There are plenty of redeeming factors the film has. While Aaron Johson is quite a letdown, the rest of the cast shines so much more. Grace Moretz is quick-witted as Hit-Girl, Nicolas Cage is a riot giving his best Adam West impression when in costume, and Mark Strong has fun being a badass while struggling to connect to his nerdy son, played solidly by Christopher Mintz-Plasse. Director Matthew Vaugh keeps up the pace and makes sure that on a shallow level, the film is entertaining through and through. If only there would have been more brains applied in its context, Kick-Ass could have been the superhero movie to end all superhero movies."

","I loathe the fact that every summer for the past decade has been infested with comic-book superhero movies aimed at teenies with ADHD. Kick-Ass seemed to be an antidote for all that. It has enough self-aware humor without breaking the fourth wall (which I hate) but it superficially breezes through so much potential that, by the end of it, you don't feel like enough has happened.<br/><br/>Aaron Johnson plays Dave Lizewski, a totally average high school schmo who decides that there is too much apathy in world and that someone needs to stand up and be a real superhero. The problem is that zeal is his only weapon. He becomes Kick-Ass, and tries hard, and very gradually hones his skills while beating up petty thugs, before being noticed by Big Daddy and Hit-Girl (the ever-eccentric Nic Cage and Chloe Moretz); a father/daughter duo who are far more efficient at annihilating New York's mafioso. Kick-Ass' public appeal and media profile skyrocket while crime boss Frank D'Amico scours the city looking for him.<br/><br/>There are some plot holes that bug me. I don't usually care much for nit-picking but Dave Lizewski doesn't appear to go to school with Chris D'Amico, though he recognizes him at the comic-book store. Then how on Earth does he not work out that Red Mist is Chris in disguise, thus leading to him willingly walking into a trap at the lumber yard? The film is very bright and colorful, shot in anamorphic Panavision, and it looks a hundred times better than most other comic-book movies shot in Super-35 (those awful Fantastic Four movies, Iron Man). Kiss-Ass also has re-watch value too, which sets it apart from the rest of the comic chaff. I just wish there was a bit more to it.<br/><br/>Matthew Vaughn is also a far superior director to his chum Guy Ritchie."

I've seen other movies like that but it was obvious this film wasn't meant to be realistic, with the over-the-top violence and the supposedly ordinary people performing impossible tricks. At first this put me off but as I continued to watch, the more I liked this film. It had likable characters, a great fairytale story, exciting action befitting of a film whose title is Kick-Ass and a surprisingly good soundtrack.

I tried to be a superhero in high school by defending those who could not defend themselves, but I never had a costume or cool alias. Kick-Ass (a.k.a. Dave Lizewski) is a teenage vigilante who becomes an internet sensation as a masked superhero. His crusade attracts the attention of Hit-Girl (Chloe Moretz) and Big-Daddy (Nicholas Cage) who join forces to fight the powerful gangster, Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong).<br/><br/>This is a fast-paced, action-packed film that is a visual feast for the eyes with colorful costumes and brilliantly choreographed fight scenes. The grotesquely violent scenes are portrayed in a satirical manner making them quite enjoyable to watch. The music selection is an essential component by adding impact to high-voltage action scenes as well as depth to emotional scenes.<br/><br/>An eclectic cast of characters adds to the film's appeal because they are relatable and enviable. Hit-Girl (a.k.a., Mindy Macready) is absolutely the best part of this movie. She is a pint-sized, powerful avenger who slings guns, knives and vulgarity with ease. All of this is done under the watchful eye of her doting father, Big-Daddy (a.k.a. Damon Macready). The relationship between Mindy and her father is heartwarming, albeit unconventional. There is something endearing and disturbingly funny about a little girl whose daddy teaches her how to take a bullet in the chest.<br/><br/>Despite all the blood and violence there are some touching moments. This is a film about finding your true identity, breaking out of your comfort zone and taking extreme risk to earn great rewards. Kick-Ass is a cult classic that will have devoted fans for decades. I am definitely one of them! Kick-Ass. Dir. Matthew Vaughn. Perf. Aaron Johnson, Nicolas Cage and Chloe Moretz. Marv Films: 2010, Film."
"hnt_dnl","8","1","4","30 June 2011"," A tad uneven, but pretty good and funny parody/homage
","Basically, KICK ASS (2010) is a modern-day ripoff of other modern-day ripoffs! From some of the reviews I've seen, they have said it is Superbad meets Kill Bill. Well, I have yet to see Superbad, so can't comment on that one, but I HAVE seen Kill Bill (from 2003), and it is one of my favorite films of the decade of the 00s, but just Part 1! This movie also noticeably has elements of Spiderman and Batman. Basically, it's a fusion of many superhero movies! <br/><br/>Director Matthew Vaughn does noticeably borrow from Kill Bill, Part 1, with ""kick ass"" action sequences that will definitely remind one of that film. Most of the big scenes involve the protagonist of the moment (either Kick Ass or Hit Girl or Big Daddy) single-handedly taking out a group of goons (a la The Bride in Kill Bill) and looking cool doing it. I really did like the musical choices that Vaughn made, which shows that he definitely learned well from Tarantino. Well, at least early Tarantino!<br/><br/>Many of the reviews rave about 13-year old Chloe Moretz (who plays Mindy MacReady, aka Hit Girl) and Moretz is definitely terrific in the role, showing amazing acting chops for such a young actress. But I was also impressed by star Aaron Johnson (Dave Lizewski, aka the title character Kick Ass). As high-schooler Dave/Kick Ass, Johnson really created a sympathetic, relatable character that matured throughout the film in a realistic way. I look forward to the sequel (c'mon, you know there will be one!) where Hit Girl has to teach Kick Ass the art of being a superhero! <br/><br/>The story of KICK ASS is that social outcast Dave, who recently lost his Mom, is frustrated by the inaction of society and his loser status, so he embarks on a mission to be a superhero called ""Kick Ass"". With his ebay-ordered costume and a pair of numchucks, Kick Ass first attempt at hero is met with disaster, as he gets stabbed by a pair of thugs. Once recovered, Dave becomes popular with his school crush Katie (a charming, beautiful Lyndsy Fonseca), who thinks he is gay. Dave plays the part in order to be friends and stay close to Katie, while re-embarking on his superhero adventures. Dave also has 2 nerdy friends Marty and Todd (hilariously played by Clark Duke and Evan Peters), who live vicariously through both Dave and Kick Ass.<br/><br/>The adult cast is led by none other than famous Nicolas Cage, who wonderfully essays the role of Damon MacReady, aka Big Daddy. Cage pretty much riffs on his own well-known movie persona as you'll see many characters (both good and bad!) in his portrayal; Cage's Big Daddy persona is essentially a copy of Adam West's Batman from the 1960s and it is a hoot! The aforementioned Moretz plays Big Daddy's daughter and partner in superhero-dom Hit Girl. The scenes of Cage quizzing Moretz are really funny and witty.<br/><br/>Also great are Mark Strong (as the movie's main villain gangster Frank D'Amico)and Christopher Mintz-Plasse (as his eager-to-please teen son Chris, aka Red Mist). The movie is very well-cast.<br/><br/>The dialogue is by-the-numbers and simple, yet still very witty and entertaining to listen to. There are a few cheesy parts, but by and large, it's a funny script. Part of the minuses for me were that at times the movie feels like an odd mix of realism and fantasy, as well as comedy and violence. On the one hand, you have the all-too-realistic scenes with Kick Ass, but then you have the over-the-top, flashy stuff of Hit Girl. Also, there is real disturbing violence in this movie, including a death by fire that is hard to watch, and the aforementioned stabbing. No way can someone take their kids to see a movie like this, yet the main characters are kids! <br/><br/>But, KICK ASS is definitely one of the better done homages I've seen in a while and the cast is very engaging and does a fine job with a solid script. KICK ASS...I'll recommend it, but only for adults!"

","I was at the point to think that there would have been any more super hero movie that could surprise me till I saw Kick-ass.<br/><br/>Such an amazing work, able to combine a down to heart plot to a super - hero legend. The movie start kinda like American pie and end like Green Hornet, having in the middle this surrogates of Batman played by Cage which is a really funny character ""Big-daddy"". <br/><br/>I am still astonished by the main actor performance which was unbelievably true and real, also I like the photography and the special effects.<br/><br/>I decided to gave it a 10 as I did for ""the dark knight"" because I believe this is the light-side of it, or maybe the teenager version actually.<br/><br/>Only thing I don't like at times was the soundtrack, actually to pushed to the ""parodistic"" in some scene, but still it wasn't enough bad to get it down to a 9/10. IT is absolutely a masterpiece and most of all, an inspiring movie. <br/><br/>Kick-ass kick the major ass!"
"rraa-dd","10","1","4","4 April 2011"," Briiliant - loved every second of this
","What can I say, there is nothing to complain about. This movie is perfect throughout, from the characters to the soundtrack. At first I found all the violence, blood and the fact that a 14 year old girl uses the ""c"" word and murders lots of bad blokes a little bizarre, but overall I like the whole idea. The humour in the movie is absolutely fantastic, whether it is the evil character's ridiculous approach to everything (A bazooka? ... okay.), or Kick-Ass' lack of fortune. Nicolas Cage's role in the movie is somewhat bizarre too, mainly because (at least to me) he is the best known actor out of all the cast, however his role isn't as big as in some of his other movies. Either way, this is not something to complain about, just pointing it out. He is still brilliant. The movie has a lot of action and a great light-hearted aura around it. I'd recommend for everyone to watch this, it really is worth it. Oh and the soundtrack - simply fantastic."

","I have heard so many great things about this movie. About how it's one of the most original, funny, entertaining, vulgar comic book films ever. And I agree that it was unique, humorous, not boring, and was definitely vulgar. I couldn't help but feel a little disappointed with the final product when I finally sat down and watched it, but that doesn't mean it's bad.<br/><br/>I liked the main character, I liked the fact that he wasn't a jock, a science nerd, or a rich kid, he's just a normal, average guy. I loved Hit-Girl and Big Daddy, they kicked so much ass I wanted to see so much more of them.<br/><br/>But for the most part, the movie doesn't really focus that much on the characters and more or less focuses on the action, which is fine. Really, there's not much I can complain about in this movie, it was fun, unique, creative, and funny, but I just don't see why it's so popular."
"Leofwine_draca","8","1","4","18 February 2011"," A film that screams entertainment
","KICK ASS is one of those rare films that do what they say on the tin: it absolutely kicks ass. I wasn't sure whether I'd appreciate the zany humour on offer here, as most of the time I find Hollywood comedy tired and laborious. This turns out to be a real shot in the arm, a film that takes great delight in spoofing such silly fare as the umpteenth Spiderman sequel/reboot and the interminable Iron Man movies. Kudos to Jane Goldman for writing it and Matthew Vaughn (whose LAYER CAKE I hated) for directing.<br/><br/>The jokes come thick and fast, most of them funny. Aaron Johnson is a delightful as the ineffectual superhero, but the real star is Chloe Moretz, whose Hit Girl is probably the most original character in a film all year. What a surprise, too, to find Nicolas Cage so hilarious, with his deadpanned impression of Adam West's BATMAN another highlight. The plot moves along at a fair old whack and is loaded with delicious action and outrageous profanity. The CCTV footage showing Big Daddy tackling a warehouse full of thugs was wonderful. Mark Strong makes for another charismatic bad guy, but I'd like to start seeing him playing the hero once in a while. Vaughn can't help including roles for his old buddies like Jason Flemyng and Dexter Fletcher, but there's no harm in that either. What a breath of fresh air this movie is."
"Angelus2","10","1","4","16 February 2011"," A different kind of Superhero
","Being a life long comic fan its quite refreshing to see a Superhero movie that brings something new into the genre. Kick-Ass is dark, sad, action packed and above all, hilarious....A superhero movie thats actually funny..it's unheard of! Dave is the school nerd who dreams of being a superhero...and then one day he decides..'why not?' What happens next changes everything, as Dave becomes Kick-Ass and takes his justice to the streets...it's not all glamorous..he realises being a crime-fighter is dangerous stuff, but it seems that Kick-Ass has inspired some, who are teetering on the brink of sanity,'Hit-Girl and Big Daddy', a Father and Daughter whose lives revolve around catching criminals.<br/><br/>It's a very funny film, no doubt. Nicholas Cage and Chloe Moretz set every scene on fire, they just play off each other so well and deliver some brilliant dialogue. The fight scenes are brilliant to watch, Kick-Ass especially as he bring down thugs. Brilliant."
"ThreeThumbsUp","7","1","4","22 November 2010"," Original if anything else
","What I enjoy about Kick-Ass is its originality. The idea of ordinary people attempting to become superheroes without any extraordinary powers or super-strength seems so simple, yet this film somehow derives a rather complex plot out of the concept.<br/><br/>The sheer violence that dominates most of the movie is a little shocking at first, but then you realize that this is an R-rated picture for a reason. I'm not sure all of it was necessary, but if anything else, the brutality adds to the film's uniqueness.<br/><br/>I think Kick-Ass is also successful because it has some serious character development, an essential ingredient to any highly rated motion picture. The narration takes the viewer directly into the mind of David/Kick-Ass. It's the simplest -- and often most over-used -- method of getting the audience attached the central character, but it works in this case. A genuine sense of urgency is created as you find yourself rooting for the good guys.<br/><br/>Even though it doesn't exactly play by all the rules, at its core, Kick-Ass is a superhero movie, with super characters, super villains and super sidekicks. The climax is rather ostentatious and the conclusion fantastic, but it doesn't come unexpected. By the end of the movie, the viewer has a firm sense of the direction and shouldn't be disappointed with how things finish.<br/><br/>Kick-Ass is NOT a children's movie and should be avoided by anyone under the age of 15-16. Not only are heads and limbs blown completely off, but there is a scene of cocaine use and slightly graphic teenage sex. It's up to parents to keep this movie out of the hands of their children. I mean, even the title has a curse word."

That we have this season is popular? Spring-summer season. Please, give me a wetsuit of Kick-Ass ... What? And the costume is a Black Widow? My wife size there? Hit-girl costume for my daughter ...

Don't we already have enough violence and unrest among the new generation? Other than that, not a kiddie movie at all; but then again for grown ups....a KICK-ASS action movie!"

","Kick-Ass is a super hero, but not a super hero. This sounds a little crazy but this is a teen age kid who buys a suit on line, procures a couple of Iron Bars & then gets his ass kicked. For most of the film, the hero is the mirror image of the films title other than the first real film action sequence.<br/><br/>While Kick-Ass is living his dream of Peter Parker style of life, he gets involved with a girl he loves. Meanwhile he meets Big Daddy & Hit Girl who both are focused on destroying a crime boss that helped big daddy get sent to jail & killed his wife. For about a third of the film these two heroes carry the load for Kick-Ass. Then towards the end, Kick-Ass really does get involved in the action.<br/><br/>This is Marvel Comics material carefully brought to film. While it does not flesh out as much story as Spiderman at times, it brings together some plot lines. The oldest actor in the film is Nicolas Cage & he is quite good as Big Daddy.<br/><br/>In the end they get mob boss that big daddy wants to get because he harmed his family.

"daryl42-1","7","1","4","18 August 2010"," Not quite what I was expecting, but still an entertaining movie.
","7.5<br/><br/>I don't like superhero movies. In fact, I don't like superheroes very much at all. I can't quite understand what it is exactly about superheroes that makes people my age so attracted to them. I think it's a juvenile fantasy, and it looks dumb. Little kids fantasize about having unique super powers, and having great strength. Spiderman even babies us, and tells us, ""yeah, you can have all that power, but you need to use it responsibly.""<br/><br/>Here comes Kick-Ass, a superhero movie that is not about superheroes, but rather, normal people who aspire to be superheroes. In premise, it sounds interesting. However, the final product becomes an unrealistic and over the top excuse for slapstick. In fact, the interactions between the main characters in Kick-Ass are pretty juvenile, and it's pretty clear this movie is aimed for tweens. The villain is a rich mobster who takes his anger out on superheroes who seem to be dedicated to ruining his vile business. The main character, Kick-Ass, acts like a child most of the time and his interaction with Red Mist, who is actually the mobster's son, is like watching teenagers interact awkwardly. OK, maybe there's nothing wrong with a movie for youth, but if you were expecting more, this is what you're getting instead.<br/><br/>Kick-Ass's main hook is that the so-called ""superheroes"" do not actually have any super powers. Unfortunately, they either have an incredible ability for martial arts, a knack for avoiding death, or shrugging off fatal injury. If you ask me, those are pretty good super powers. The movie loses its ground to reality when the little girl is flipping around the room dismembering adults (armed ones) with her weapons. I was expecting Kick-Ass to be sort of like the original Watchmen graphic novel, and explore what human discipline and willpower can achieve. However, it's just a shallow comedy.<br/><br/>The filmmaking in Kick-Ass isn't bad, but it also isn't anything special. The film is obviously professionally done, but then there are those typical camera angles. Sure, it's nice to be able to comfortably take in what's on the screen, but there's so much more that can be done with a camera. And there's also so much more that could have been done with the film's idea.<br/><br/>I hate to knock on a film for being either bad or mediocre. I appreciate all films and I hope that the experience of creating one serves as an aid to the abilities of those involved. Kick-Ass will entertain young audiences, especially those who love comic books and superheroes. But for those that were hoping for something more, do not expect a lot, for fear that you will be disappointed like I was. I hate to succumb to peer hype, but unfortunately Kick-Ass is a victim of this. Or am I the victim, because I didn't enjoy Kick-Ass as much as everyone else did? Either way, if I sound like a jerk, you'll probably enjoy Kick-Ass."

","I enjoyed parts of the film including my favorite sequence shot First Person Shooter style. That was cool filmmaking & wish it would have been done a little longer. Some of the acting was just plain bad too. The lead kid, was really not lead material whatsoever. I realize an 11 year old girl can be trained to be pretty emotionless if she is raised in such a way. ***SPOILER*** However after she loses her dad, her pretty much lack of any sort of sadness is kind of pushing it. After all she's still a kid who only has her father. ***END SPOILER*** As many have already said the star of the movie is the girl Chloe Moretz as 'Hit Girl'. She is a superstar in the making as long as she matures well & picks the right roles (""Let Me In"" is a step in the right direction!) & doesn't go the Lindsay Lohan route. We all thought Dakota Fanning would still be something today, but she has landed into more supporting roles & dare I say it, not as good an actress as when she was younger. One of the best things of the movie is that despite the budget only being $30 million it looks like it cost double or triple that. Why can't we have some of those sorts of people that can keep the costs down, working for the gov't, so we can get out of this Trillion dollar debt. That's right Gov't service isn't nearly as fun & doesn't pay as well. It's a good film, but to be rated above ""The Princess Bride"" is quite simply insulting. Now I know nothing of the comic I purely judge a film on what makes a good film, a good script, acting, character interactions, directing, so on and so forth.

He could have done a little more with his character, but I guess it's supposed to be a comedy too. It was an okay movie, the only real thing I liked about this movie is ""Hit Girl"", and her action moves. She was really good. I wouldn't want my daughter to have her foul mouth, but I wouldn't mind her being able to protect herself and have the confidence and ability to conquer like she does. Good movie, could have been a better story.

The fantastic mix of comedy, emotion, parody and sheer downright awesomeness make this a film not to be missed.<br/><br/>While high in comedy and creating some moments where I was doubled over while watching it the film doesn't pass up on scenes that draw you into the characters either. Sometimes the things you're laughing at are because if you didn't you'd cry. There's a dark gritty story behind the humour that can live up to Sin City, it's just put across in a different manner. As with all comic book superheros this one delivers the drama and background that make the heroics themselves just another part of fleshing out the individuals.<br/><br/>The only way people could possibly pick fault with this film is with the language and gratuitous violence, but it fits in so well and makes the picture better for it.

"Turfseer","1","2","13","13 September 2010"," Director Vaughn exploits children in modern-day 'Don Quixote' tale
","Kick-ass is the story of one Dave Lizewski, an 'ordinary', semi-nerdy high school student who can't understand why anyone in his age group never attempted to become a superhero in real life. You would think that such a premise has real comic possibilities but humorless director Matthew Vaughn decides to take things in a different direction. Right off the bat, Vaughn sets a nasty tone by serving up a mentally unbalanced young man, jumping off a building dressed in a superhero costume. The bad vibes are compounded when Lizewski's Mom drops dead of a aneurysm at the breakfast table. Fun stuff!!! <br/><br/>The Act I set-up is full of the clichés and stereotypes typical of many 'youth' movies of today. For example, there's the obligatory scene where a couple of thugs steal a cellphone and comic books belonging to the good guy high school students. Then there's the stereotypical antagonist, Frank D'Amico, a vulgar comic-book Mafioso whose goons kill two hapless drug dealers in two repetitious scenes that occur within about ten minutes of one another (in one scene, the goons chop off the guy's finger and then shoot him and in a more repulsive scene, a man bursts like a balloon in a giant microwave).<br/><br/>Vaughn attempts to conjure up a modern-day 'Don Quixote' figure with his geeky Lizewski. The nerd courts his 'Dulcinea', the attractive but morally bankrupt Katie who's been dating a drug dealer. His first quest to prove himself to Katie fails miserably after he takes on the two thugs who had robbed him earlier and ends up getting stabbed in the stomach, then hit by a car and almost dies. Fortunately when found, he convinces the paramedics not to let anyone know he was wearing his Kick-ass costume; but the rumor gets out anyway that he was found naked and is now presumed to be gay by most students at the school (including Katie who befriends but also patronizes him as she also assumes he's gay).<br/><br/>Kick-ass could have gone in a more clever direction by having Lizewski train hard in martial arts and actually become a truly competent 'superhero' in the vein of Bruce Wayne (aka Batman). But instead it's pure luck that he survives the gang fight which he attempts to break up on the streets and in so doing becomes an internet sensation on Youtube. Lizewski continues with his 'Man of La Mancha' act by paying Katie's boyfriend a visit and again naively attempts to intervene on her behalf. As it turns out, 'Big Daddy' and 'Hit-Girl' save the passive Kick-ass's ass! <br/><br/>Now I have no problem with Damon Macready's story arc which involves the former cop attempting to take revenge on bad guy D'Amico after being framed. But what kind of message is being sent when he involves his ten year old daughter in his thirst for revenge? It's wholly inappropriate to depict a ten year old girl being trained by her father to become a professional assassin. Equally inappropriate is when teenager Chris D'Amico aka Red Mist shoots Hit-Girl—what completely makes no sense at all is that Red Mist is upset when his father's thugs carry off his buddy Kick-ass but he has no guilt whatsoever in shooting a ten year old girl? One other thing: after Frank is dispatched, doesn't Chris realize his father is dead? Does he try to find out what happened to his father or does it even occur to him? The bottom line is that the teenager shows no emotions at all which is not in keeping with the character's earlier scenes where he displayed affection for his father.<br/><br/>The stupidity of Vaughn's comic book world is further on display when Frank D'Amico mistakenly shoots the wrong Kick-ass in broad daylight. You would think that the head of an organized crime family would be smart enough to realize that there are plenty of people walking around the city in the Kick-ass costume after the character goes viral over the internet. As for Lizewski's revelation to Katie that he's actually Kick-ass—suddenly bad girl Katie is transformed into a saint and falls for him hook, line and sinker. But Lizewski gets rewarded for finally realizing that he was a dumb ass all along! Some hero!<br/><br/>The Kick-ass finale is perhaps the most repulsive aspect of the film. Big Daddy and Kick-ass are tortured on live television and then when the networks refuse to show the gory feed, all the voyeurs run to their computers to watch the sorry spectacle online. Finally, Vaughn resurrects his sadistic ten year old after she's shot, who then proceeds to dispatch one Mafia goon after another, in one unspeakably violent scene after another.<br/><br/>Somehow after seeing a film like this, I kind of feel that something should be done about our current child labor laws. Rather than having accolades heaped upon Director Vaughn, perhaps the best place for him would be a secure lock-up--criminal or psychiatric, take your pick."

","Absolutely terrible film.<br/><br/>I can't remember the last time I walked out during a film.<br/><br/>By far the worst film I've never seen Nicolas Cage act in.<br/><br/>Appalling acting.<br/><br/>A simplistic script that is far from witty. Cringeworthy cliché one-liners. Cheap potty-humor.<br/><br/>I can see how some children would find the movie fun however it wouldn't be appropriate for them to watch.<br/><br/>If you have the slightest taste in film and would consider yourself even mildly intelligent, I would urge you NOT to see this film!"
"English-Class2014","9","1","5","29 April 2014"," Unique mixture of comedy, action, and exaggerated visual effects!
","It is such a great movie and parodies successfully all these serious superhero movies in itself. The mixture between comedy, action and exaggerated visual effects make this movie so unique. Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) is as teenager who becomes a superhero named kick-ass. He is the main protagonist of the story of kick-ass. Dave Lizewski is an insecure and mild mannered teenager. He is a nobody at school and is not the class geek or class clown, he only exists and is not perceived. But Dave is a passionate comic book reader, which serves as a driving force of his decision to become a costumed vigilante. But Dave also has a 'romantic' side. He is attracted to a classmate named Katie. All in all, Dave is a courageous and brave person. He is embodied very well by Aaron Johnson, who parodies all superheroes in a brilliant way. But all the other characters are also well played and in an extraordinary way, for example ' Big Daddy' (Nicolas Cage). Big Daddy is a parody of Batman and it is clearly recognizable that Big Daddy should be like Batman. The actor Nicolas Cage varies his voice like Batman. But these parodies and this movie are not ridiculous but rather well acted and funny. The director surpasses himself with the choice of the actors. The way the movie describes the story is peerless. In almost every scene, you can recognize something from these typical superhero movies. Regardless whether there is a setting and a camera perspective from Spiderman, quotes from X-Man and so on. I'm a big fan of superhero movies and this movie makes me feel very concerned. It isn't that typical movie about a superhero; it is also a movie about the wish to become one. With all of these elements from other movies it becomes much more realistic, if you ignore the action scenes. In addition to that you can name the VFX too. They aren't the best, but they are really hilarious in a way. Sometimes they are so excessive that you may think the movie wants to parody itself with them too. The Soundtrack is also pretty good. It has got the one typical recognizable superhero movie main theme. Finally you can say that Kickass is a very funny, action-packed and easy understandable movie. I recommend it to everyone, who wants to have a good movie night with friends or is a fan of humorous and superhero movies.<br/><br/>Tim G. and Florian S."
"phubbs","8","1","5","17 April 2014"," Kick-Ass
","The world of the visually violent comicbook movie probably first kicked off with 'Blade' way back in 1998 (honourable mention to the 1989 Punisher), although this film wasn't really ultra violent and filled with profanity. After that along came 'Watchmen' which offered a very realistic take on the superhero genre and was pretty gritty. Since then there hasn't really been that much until this graphic novel adaptation popped up with huge amounts of real violence and bucket loads of naughty words. It was like 'Robocop' for the comicbook genre.<br/><br/>The actual plot isn't any different from your average superhero flick. Its basically an origins tale showing how a young 'Peter Parker-like' teen gets to grips with his life and sets out to become a superhero after making his own suit. There is no emotional death of guardians to push our hero along here admittedly, this guy just wants to fight crime but ends up getting in way too deep.<br/><br/>The angle for this creation is the fact its set within the real world where people do get hurt and superheroes don't actually have super powers. Its a concept that may feel totally milked these days but back in 2010 it wasn't...that much. The character of 'Kick-Ass' is just a young male teen in a scuba suit with modifications and a couple batons, when he starts out he gets stabbed and beaten almost getting himself killed. The characters he meets up with later in the form of 'Big Daddy' and 'Hit-Girl' are also merely regular people but with good fighting and weapon skills. The bad guys they fight are normal everyday thugs, pimps, drug dealers, robbers and mobsters, its simply the real world.<br/><br/>This is why the film is such a breathe of fresh air (for the time) and so intense. When we see fights going down we know its all for real and the heroes can't rely on any super powers or super weapons, anything could happen technically. Sequences such as...Hit-Girl kills a whole bunch of black drug dealer dudes with many amputations, Kick-Asses initial bloody brawls, when Big Daddy and Kick-Ass get captured and are beaten with bats and of course the excellent adrenaline rush when Big Daddy takes down mob boss 'Frank D'Amico's' warehouse of goons, are all brilliantly directed and visually slick but red raw with bone cracking realism.<br/><br/>There are of course your typical superhero-esque visuals at times, some over the top martial arts and the odd moment that will challenge your suspension of disbelief. I guess that is bound to happen in most flicks of this nature just to add that tiny bit of fun fantasy, but in general this film is down to earth, seedy and gritty as hell. Despite the fact most of the characters are just kids, the film certainly isn't for kids with limbs and bullets flying, blood spurting everywhere, Hit-Girl swearing like there is no tomorrow and some nut crunching beat downs. The scene where Big Daddy is killed is especially dark and quite harrowing really, its shocking at first.<br/><br/>Most of the characters aren't anything too special really. The stand outs obviously being Johnson as Kick-Ass who crosses between the obligatory comicbook character geek and a reasonably tough superhero (at times) really well. Moretz grabs your attention merely down to her age truth be told where as her character feels more like a lethal Christmas elf. But its clearly Cage as Big Daddy who wins the day for me, that brilliant Adam West sounding voice and 'Batman-esque' outfit, quite amusing. I would like to see a film centred around his character.<br/><br/>I must also quickly mention that this entire idea may well have been pinched from the 1999 goofy superhero comedy spoof 'Mystery Men'. That film is all about a team of superhero wannabes that don't actually have any super powers but must somehow defeat a supervillain who also has no real super powers. The film is set within a realistic universe that visually copies and slightly mocks Gotham City but no one in that world actually has any super powers. So 'Kick-Ass' follows suit but goes down the violent route with dark comedy.<br/><br/>Its a controversial movie for sure, what with the very young Moretz playing the loose lipped Hit-Girl and dressing in that slightly disturbing school girl outfit near the end. Oh and the fact she goes around slicing and dicing bad guys willy-nilly accompanied by a weird light-hearted music track at one point. Add to that a film that portrays all these youngsters getting involved in such brutal violence yet the film almost makes it look like fun n games in silly outfits. It did raise eyebrows when it came out and honesty I can see why, but personally I think these are the things that make the film stand out giving it some epic originality.<br/><br/>I loved how they stuck to the source material (relatively), I loved seeing Kick-Ass starting out and getting his head kicked in, seeing him slowly get somewhere even though he isn't actually any good then being stupid enough to create his own Myspace. The film really does the origins thing well and makes you invested in the hero, you find yourself really wanting him to succeed and at the same time seeing how risky this field of work would be in reality (in case you ever thought about being a hero). The only thing that let it down for me was the very ending where things got a bit too superhero-ish and comicbook-like losing the dark realism. Easily one of the best graphic novel/comicbook adaptations and it wasn't watered down, they kept it as it should be.<br/><br/>8/10"

","I had quite high expectations for this movie. I thought this will be one of those hilarious half-parody movies. But my expectations were crashed to the ground. And here is why.<br/><br/>This movie actually had very little of comedy elements. VERY. I am not even sure if this movie can be counted as a comedy. Through the whole movie I laughed only one time.<br/><br/>Actually first part of the movie seemed quite depressing to me. Firstly because as I said there was very little of comedy elements and secondly because the new ""superhero"" failed very hard. I mean he got stabbed, then he got ran over by a car (I suppose this was one of comedy scenes, but... Come on, what are you twelve?), and got taken to a hospital. I am a fan of superheros, have read comics and watched movies of them and his failure seemed quite depressing to me.<br/><br/>Can't say second part of the movie was much better. It weren't depressing anymore. It was just screwed up. All this stuff with Red Mist dude, big daddy and his daughter. And because of lack of humor it weren't very funny. <br/><br/>So after all, what is this movie? Most screwed up drama ever or freakiest action movie of the century?"
"trippy90","Null","1","5","27 May 2011"," Kick Ass is great.
","Kick Ass is a excellent film. Its a super hero film which is very unique.

Nicolas Cage as big daddy is also very good and you really feel for him. Its one of his best roles in my opinion. Kick ass himself is good as well as the unlikely hero.<br/><br/>There are some uncomfortable scenes such as Hit girl being badly beaten towards the end.

","I've never been a huge fan of super hero movies. I've enjoyed Spider-Man (the first two), and one or two Superman movies, but I've never been too much into them.<br/><br/>""Kick-Ass"" is not your usual super hero movie. Actually, the main character can't even be called a real super hero. A hero? Sure! But there's nothing super about him, it's not like he can climb walls, fly or has inhuman strength. He's pretty good at getting the crap beaten out of him though! But kicking some ass as well!<br/><br/>The plot is fun to follow, and the actors give some very good interpretations. The action is awesome, especially scenes involving Hit Girl - seriously, a young girl kicking so much ass and spreading so much blood, this probably had some people very ticked off... which I see as a good thing!<br/><br/>Photography is pretty good, the color palette of the movie is colorful and often gritty, giving it a rough comic book style look. Which, of course, fits the movie like a glove. <br/><br/>The music is great! Some epic, climatic moments that accompany the scenes flawlessly and leave them even more engaging!<br/><br/>Overall, if you're a fan of action / comedy movies and/or super hero movies, you must watch this movie.<br/><br/>8 out of 10."

","As I always first say, I have seen this movie on my PC on a Samsung LCD 17' with only two speakers.<br/><br/>This movie tries to start like a realistic movie, where no one could be a hero because (obviously) it would be killed in two seconds. But as story goes on, it starts becoming more like a comic book movie where there are heroes and the characters do many crazy things. This is fundamental for you to understand the movie and not criticize it. It is funny all the way, and action parts are great. The argument for the movie is good and the soundtrack really gets along with the scenes.<br/><br/>I give it an 8 just because I think there are little details that could have been better, at least for me."
"DJMo","7","1","5","13 November 2010"," Hilariously over-the-top!
","A hilariously over-the-top campy comic book adaptation. Aaron Johnson and Christopher Mintz-Plasse are pretty good in their dorky roles. But Chloe Moretz is awesome as Hit Girl and has some laugh-out-loud one-liners. She steals every scene she's in, complementing or offsetting Nicholas Cage's uneven performance as Big Daddy. The film also serves as an interesting social commentary about our passive, spectator YouTube culture, a satire about the glorification of violence and our modern devolution into a world of social apathy. Perhaps that is why the premise of the film -- real-life superheroes -- is so foreign to the audience at the outset until the extreme violence reminds you to sit back and enjoy: it's just a comic book."
"tuanphamd","8","1","5","13 October 2010"," Hey, green asshole...
","I was in for a complete surprise with this movie. I expected a teenage high school comedy. The only reason I watched it was because of its surprisingly high rating on IMDb. <br/><br/>The movie starts slow but hooks you in and never lets you go. The wit, humor and clever dialog are definitely there, but when the action and insanity kick in, then you are in a for a thrill ride all the way to the grand finale. <br/><br/>Chloe Moretz (Hit Girl) steals the show. Can't wait to see more of her. This movie has touches of Tarantino's Pulp Fiction/Kill Bill and Natalie Portman's Leon (The Professional).<br/><br/>Surprisingly good and entertaining.

"yora217","9","1","5","9 October 2010"," This movie Kicks Ass like it promises!!!!!!!
","This is definitely a new take for super hero movies from the tradition Batman and Spiderman movies that have been around a lot recently. Its the story about an average teenager who dreams of winning the girl he likes and becoming a super hero. Well he achieves both, and the rest of the movie after that is pretty straightforward. The real star of this movie is Hit Girl played by the young Chloe Mortez and she is Awesome in this movie. She is pretty young to be in a movie like this but she really shines in her role and even out does Nicolas Cage in my opinion, but he is really good here also. Kick Ass is not really as well developed as i would have hoped, and i felt like a lot of the parts he comes out in, especially the beginning the first five-ten minutes were an utter waste. The Red mist isn't really a classy villain and is really just a kid in a suit trying to gain the approval of his father. This movie is definitely worth watching again and again, but i found myself wanting more out of it, i kind of wanted more action from Kick Ass, since the movie is titled Kick Ass, not hit girl. Still maybe in the sequel they can focus less on the sex related jokes and references, and more on the action and story-telling. But yeah, see it if you haven't, its definitely a kick ass movie."

"Jakealope","8","1","5","2 October 2010"," Very Intreesting and Layed Film
","To be honest, at first I hated this film b4 I saw it. How did some super hero flick just released make it into the Top 250 here with some bratty pre-teen murderous girl as the breakout star. It seemed so contrived. But the best part of it is that it is a layered film. We have some nerdy teen and friends in a semi rough high school and their travails. A raft of brutal street thugs who are reality based and not too over the top. Then you have two almost super heroes, a discredited cop and his daughter, the Macreadys Big Daddy & Hit Girl who are totally over the top in their single minded desire to rid the world of Frank D'Amico and his equally over the top violent mobsters who ruined Macready;s career by getting him framed. With Nick Cage as Big Daddy, a Batman knockoff, be prepared for his trademark role immersion, except this Batman uses guns and likes to kill and trained his 11 year old daughter into a whirling dervish of death, Hit Girl, in a plaid skirt, foul mouth and purple wig. Then throw in the mobster's son, a would be faux super hero, Red Mist, and you have one heck of a movie.<br/><br/>There is the awkward teen coming of age aspect as Dave goes would be superhero to compensate for his drab, colorless existence in a trio of comic book fan outcasts. His first attempt at superherodom resulted in getting quite the beating then getting run down accidentally which required extensive orthopedic rebuild ala 6 Million Dollar Man. No one was on to him but now a rumor circulated that he was a fruit, which ironically got the attention of the beautiful girl who ignored him and who was a would be fag hag. His next attempt was a bit more successful and got him publicity as he beat off three hoods bent on stomping another one. That got a lot of attention by the media through a You Tube video.<br/><br/>But it started to get dicey when he tried to help his doting fag hag teen beauty Katie Deauxma, who was being harassed by some scumbag street level dealer she met when she volunteered at the drug needle exchange clinic. She doted on that scum who used and abused her so Dave told her to write to Kick Ass's Facebook page for some help. He gets the balls to go into the scum Rasul's apartment full of lowlifes to deliver a message and he almost gets his ass kicked when Hit Girl and Big Daddy arrived to do in the whole lot of them, take their money and save Kick Ass's skin too. The father daughter duo take a liking to him but advised him to stay out of the action. Then it got even more deeper and over the top culminating in a sky scraper storming scene that made the Boondock Saints version look like the lame crap that it was. So you had three layers, the teen coming of age, finding himself and getting laid, some run ins with brutal local lowlifes, then even more violent and brutal mobsters up to the totally over the top Hit Girl, Big Daddy duo leading to the grand finale."

","I haven't read the comic yet, but I think they did Mark Millar justice after completely destroying Wanted. Wanted is one of the best things I've read by far, and the movie is complete garbage.<br/><br/>This one though is just a great movie, no matter how closely it follows the comic book. As a movie it's just a wonderful experience all around.<br/><br/>Watching that little girl kick ass was just beautiful, I figured it would be corny, but she really pulled it off and was completely believable, that girl is just an amazing actor she really looked like she felt at home with that gun in her hand.<br/><br/>I think the movie would have been even greater if we could have seen a bit more in the romance between kick ass and his girlfriend, but between budget and time restraints and creative differences who knows how it was planned out. It is what it is.<br/><br/>The greatest thing about this movie, is the great suspense and build up it creates during what I believed was the final climax, much to my surprise the movie continued. In those few scenes their is so much emotion, between father and daughter, and the viewers watching the live video feed, it's just marvelous.<br/><br/>But In all sincerity Nicholas Cage just was terrible in this movie, just completely terrible, in fact I hate him in all movies because he looks like a comedy actor and continues to be in action films. But in this movie His Acting Was GOD AWFUL. thank god he died, a little too late for my taste, but beyond that the movie is exciting and won't leave you bored at any moment, and there are some great laughs to be had."

","I loved this movie. I thought the beginning really through you for a loop, when he was attacked and then put in the hospital. I was totally caught off guard with that, but it made the movie so much better! I also loved how realistic but not realistic it was. Kick Ass himself wasn't really a good fighter but what made him special was the fact that a majority of his bones were metal and he lost his ability to feel pain. It was just a really cool idea.<br/><br/>I didn't really like that in the commercials you get the sense that Red Mist is a good guy, but it really isn't that big of an issue. The other thing was how Nicholas Cage's outfit looked just like batman; why couldn't he come up with something more original? Oh and last but not least the jet pack, I mean really? I thought that was pretty stupid, and didn't really go along with the rest of the story.<br/><br/>I think within the genera of super hero movies it is really different and unique from movies like Spider man or Batman (even though the Dark Night was amazing)-it was more original and not so marketed to the masses."

"mistabobdobolina","5","1","5","10 August 2010"," Doesn't really come together
","The one thing that shines through most attempts to parody, satirize or ""deconstruct"" the superhero genre is how badly most of the would-be deconstructionists *want* the superhero fantasy to be true. This often lands their efforts in an awkward no man's land between homage, demystification and completely straight-faced comic book action.<br/><br/>Kick-Ass is a perfect example of this. It's really two different movies, both of which have their moments but that don't ultimately mesh together very well.<br/><br/>1. The first movie is a teen drama about the title character, Kick-Ass, a forgettable everyteen who becomes a forgettable superhero-wannabe, but whose pluck and optimism and irrepressible imagination we're meant to admire. His story is uneven and, regrettably, mostly uninspiring stuff, populated by cardboard cutout high school archetypes. His attempts at superheroism are hilarious -- and so are his interactions with false-flag fellow ""hero"" Red Mist -- but if I'm meant to have any fellow-feeling with the character's hopeless optimism and completely clueless lack of preparation, I can't always get there. When he winds up getting stabbed and then run over as the conclusion of his first attempt at crimebusting, I'm laughing *at* him more than I'm rooting for him. The scene that leads to his fifteen seconds of viral video fame, which shows him persevering through a heinous two-on-one beating, is a lot more sympathetic and inspiring, and had me finally starting to like him... but unfortunately that kind of spirit never recurs, because this first movie is very quickly stomped on by a second movie.<br/><br/>2. The second movie is about the *real* superheroes, Hit Girl and Big Daddy. This movie seems to think it's deconstructing the ""real"" superhero; Hit Girl is a prepubescent kid who's been drafted into an insane quest for revenge by her father, a lunatic who tries to disguise his voice when in costume by talking like William Shatner. The pair strike a distinctly squicky and psychotic note as they cut an epic swathe of blood through the movie's cartoonish criminal elements and draw the hapless Kick-Ass in their wake.<br/><br/>But the thing is... this second movie isn't really a deconstruction at all. It's just a movie about violent antiheroes. Comics discovered the violent antihero in the Seventies with the invention of the Punisher; it's not a groundbreaking concept at all, and Kick-Ass doesn't take it anywhere very new. There's no real consequence (save to himself) in Big Daddy's evident madness, for instance; he and Hit Girl never hurt or kill anyone who doesn't deserve it, and the criminals they destroy might as well be silhouettes on a shooting range. Ultimately, while including some well-done kung fu set pieces, this half of Kick-Ass is just straightforward comic book stuff... and the character of Kick-Ass just doesn't belong in this second movie, which squashed his own story just when it was starting to get interesting. His sudden transformation into a guy capable of mowing down rooms full of people with a gatling gun couldn't be less convincing.<br/><br/>The ill-fitting puzzle pieces of Kick-Ass are not, then, especially well-crafted in themselves nor all that satisfying as a whole. There's some entertainment to be had here, but it's inconsistent."
"chelano","6","1","5","3 August 2010"," Only some scenes ""kicked ass""
","The whole concept of the film was pretty interesting, but the writing for it was not that good. The story was pretty uneventful or in lament terms; stupid. Plus the fact they set the movie up to be non stop fighting and there really wasn't that much. So all you could ask for was the action to make up for it. Some of it did, but not really. Here is why I liked the movie though. I love the cast, a few scenes really did ""kick ass"" and the story did have potential even though it was not done right. I guess I couldn't help but like the film even though there were so many things wrong. The best cast member was Chloe Moretz. Her acting and fighting was so great, they could make a movie just about her. Aaron Johnson was decent as the main character. He is mostly a nerd who really couldn't fight. Then you have the villain who is Christopher Mintz-Plasse. He was pretty funny. Now Nicolas Cage was just OK and there is one scene that was so stupid I wanted to punch Cage in the face and say, ""why did you agree to this?"" So overall this is an interesting movie. I am sure they will make more and I think it has potential to do better. Just have to wait and see."
"baronsambdi","8","1","5","5 July 2010"," An OK, but too mainstream adaptation - that actually declines by the last quarter of the movie
","After I read the comic book, I was convinced it was almost impossible to create a mainstream film based on it. The only way such brilliant comic could work as a movie would be by selling it only on underground markets.<br/><br/>I don't want to pose like a comic book purist, but I got to say that the original comic book idea was OK: Trying to be a vigilante is a dirty, damn hard job, and almost not fun. The comic book itself starts in the toughest part of the work, with KA being beaten to pulp by the mafia guys... I don't like much the extreme graphic violence, but in the comic book the idea is way right transmitted, since the violence is that extreme that disgust you until you want to vomit.<br/><br/>No; being a kid trying to be a vigilante is a suicide; being a hero equals being crazy.<br/><br/>In the movie the idea is a little less realistic; being a superhero works way cool, and you can even learn to use backpacks and bazookas in five minutes. The first half of the movie is kinda truth to the comic plot and most of the ambient, excluding -of course- the tough parts.<br/><br/>In the comic book, the final fight is a gore fest, literally, portrayed with realism and graphic violence; you can almost feel the terror and pain of the guys being killed; just like in the real life would be. In the film, the final fight is a Hollywood action video clip, with almost no ""victims"" and no actual pain.<br/><br/>I'd say the film picks up the idea of trying to bring justice, I mean, the original and innocent idea of the Kick-ass character, but it fails to portray the actual consequences: being beaten to pulp, your testicles crushed and electrified, more and more pain.<br/><br/>Of course, Hollywood would never be able to expose crude reality or portray kids (in the comic book, they're way younger than in the movies) as being victims -and now, protagonists- of the violence that impregnates society and entertainment, as school massacres in the USA had demonstrated lately. Having it turned into an X-Rated movie wouldn't have work either, since adults don't watch movies ""with kids on it"", while teenagers are the main consumers of entertaining violence. Kinda hypocrite, I think.<br/><br/>The movie is OK if you want to enjoy some action and funny plot (the movie plot works good for the first half, since it's almost totally ripped-off from the comic book), but at the point Kick-ass flies (literally) it goes stupid and totally unbelievable, it lose its point. Watching the movie is not, either, the best way to introduce people into the Kick-Ass actual message; they'd watch the movie and forget it soon, while the comic book gives you more to think about.<br/><br/>In conclusion, according to the movie, being a superhero is cool and easy; according to the comic book, being a superhero is hard and dangerous and you're nuts if you want to be one (just like in real life).<br/><br/>I recommend this movie for fun, but the comic book's original idea is way more thrilling."

The other guys were dorks but still played their role.<br/><br/>I chuckle every time I think of all the families who took their kids to see this movie and how horrified they must've been when the little girl starts stabbing everyone.<br/><br/>Epic.

","Just before the start of the movie, some young idiots tried to make me change my seat because they were a band, but I stand up and they had to split! In fact, this helps to understand what the movie is about: not really superheroes because in the real world, they don't exist but about courage because all of us can show it we wanted. That's why courage was perceived by my favorite writer (PKD) as the finest quality because without it, all the others qualities are useless. If you let bad things happens and do nothing, you are as guilty as the actual wrong doer. This movie is great telling this lesson because you see that there are only a few people awake and aware of their duties while all the others are passive. <br/><br/>This movie is also a funny and accurate testimony about teens in the third millennium: Girls, wanking, comics-books are still present but now Internet, cellulars, social groups are part of the life and change it forever. Every moment in life becomes faster and as Bill Gates said, the world is right at the tip of your finger. <br/><br/>As a comic fan, I particularly liked the sketches of JRJR (John Romita JR, the actual artist of the comic) that can be seen at the Big Daddy Hideout and in the comic montage even if his story was difficult to understand. I can't judge if this is a faithful adaptation or not because I don't have read the original comics yet. <br/><br/>I can only say that it was great up to the online beating. The stroboscopic light was great and I think it would have been a terrific grand finale. But, the movie adds another reel after this and it was not ""Kick Ass"" anymore but a Bond movie with a lot of gadgets. <br/><br/>But, I had fun overall and this new and cool cast worths paying attention!"

","There is a line where Johnson's Kickass compares his need for action after fantasising for a long time with that of a serial killer. The film shares pretty much the same attitude; unconventional in it's attribution to the more cosmic superhero flicks and dethroning the s**t out of them to claim an entirely unexpected yet commanding fan following. If you think this is an exaggeration, u obviously are alien to the internet.<br/><br/>Saw this at Cineworld Haymarket in London at a preview screening. Had heard great reviews about it and was sceptical it may not match my high expectations which has been not infrequent in the past. But Kickass was FUN!!! right from the shrewd opening scene to the super violent culmination, the movie was just one great ride. Clichés are over turned on its head and given new dimensions. Like the inevitable love angle, mental trauma of the superhero- his constant struggle with his alter-ego and the society's take on his avatar- everything is like nothing you have seen before.<br/><br/>Performances in a superhero flick tend to be incredibly wooden unless a genius like Nolan is at the helm. Without making any comparisons, its safe to say Mathew Vaughn knows how to mold his actors into the characters he has envisaged. Aaron Johnson is confident and quite perfect as kick-ass with the right amount of vulnerability on show. His American accent is perfect. Nic Cage makes a welcome comeback in a small but well written role. Mintz Plasse is competent and is getting there. It's always great to see the super cool Mark Strong and he is brilliant in this too. But as you expected sweet and cuddly Chloe Moretz steals the the thunder and makes Hit Girl an iconic pop cultural phenomenon. The foul mouthed ultra violent 11 year old may have your granny fuming at her real life parents but she is sure to have created an indelible stamp on your mind you will just sympathise with poor granny for not having nearly as much fun as you did. Trust me, like the nerdy friend of Kickass, you too will fall in love with her! Kudos to Vaughn and team for this entertaining little gem and an extra pat on the back for him for daring to move out of the studio system to fund the project himself. The film is so much better for it. Don't believe me? Watch studio pet child Wolfman...<br/><br/>Dunno wen this releases in the States but drop your pants and see this whenever that is. The most incredibly entertaining flick of the year!!!"
"mariomaniac2","9","2","17","27 March 2010"," Will make you care about superheroes again.
","Watching the trailer for Kick-Ass I was pessimistic. It appeared to be extreme for its own sake, the characters were lazy and unoriginal. The relationship between hit girl and her father especially struck me as forced and weird for its own sake. Having now watched the film in full I can't say I was wrong.<br/><br/>The difference, though, is that all of these elements work perfectly in context, because when a human being decides to go superhero they're likely to be an unoriginal weirdo, and are certainly taking things to unnecessary extremes. This is the beauty of Kick-Ass, and allows it to effortlessly achieve that which a recent crop of big budget deconstructive superhero flicks have fruitlessly strived for in recent times. The Nolan Batmans, Hancock and, most significantly, Watchmen tried to show us the consequences of putting a hero in the real world, then laid before us vastly unrealistic and exaggerated characters for our consideration. The problem with these films was that they got bogged-down in their own significance, imploring us to stop and deeply think about what a superhero is and the consequent moral implications, etc, etc. They failed to realise that comic book superheroes do not truly exist, and if they do it is for no other reason than to entertain us. By grasping this, Kick-Ass shines as wonderfully easy to relate to and batsh*t insane, simultaneously.<br/><br/>Many reviewers have praised Kick-Ass as a ""thinking person's film"" for its unconventional approach to the superhero, but I would argue the exact opposite. Its characters occur so naturally and its events so typically that the viewer just has to sit back and enjoy the show. Its treatment of superhero legend somehow avoids both damnation and mockery, and feels like nothing other than joyful celebration and homage. The glue that holds all of this in place is the film's magnificent sense of humour which, despite the odd self-aware joke that might lose its potency over time (not wanting to die ""before finding out what happens on Lost"" an example) sure as hell made me laugh."

","Super Kick-Ass film. The level of bloody action never disappoints with a good dose of humour. I have seen the clips and read the reviews. Thought cool I have to see it to believe it. The story is a about a typical geeky high school kid who's real super power is invisibility to girls until he decided that he can no longer stand and watch the petty crimes that takes place. He donned a rubber costume that he bought on line and decided to do something about it in the form of 'Kick-Ass'. I won't spoil the rest of the story. Just go and watch it. If you are a fan of hard core comic violence you are in for a treat. Especially Hit-Girl. You will feel a bit uncomfortable about what looks like a 11 year old girl with killer instincts of The Bride (Urman Thurman)in Kill Bill, but she is so awesome that every time she is the screen trash talking or mass murdering you will cheer her on.

","Disturbing. Why?<br/><br/>Well, it's not the violence. I've watched plenty of bloody violent films, no problem. It's not even the swearing, seen many realistic and even fantasy films with swearing.<br/><br/>*Careful spoilers*<br/><br/>What gets me is that all this is being done by a small child. A girl of about 9 or 10. I couldn't believe it when she just blurted out the 'C' word without any compulsion. i have adult friends who'd beat you up just for saying that in the presence of a woman let alone a little girl saying it! Quite offensive. Then it's the gratuitous violence she meets out. Not only is it very bloody, but she kills people who have obviously given up the fight, like a woman in the one of the first battles (though we don't actually see her die). plenty of men die bloodily though and I even began to feel that even these bad men hadn't done enough to deserve these kinds of deaths.<br/><br/>Neither did I find it funny. It was kind of OK at first with the Super Hero nerd teenage lad ending up in hospital trying to sort out two bullies, but when the violent 10 year old girl came along with her swearing and violence, I just felt no need to smile at all.<br/><br/>Anyway, I feel a line has been crossed here, that shouldn't be. I think it's sending out a very dangerous message. It's exploitation of children (like someone else mentioned) in movies using extreme violence.<br/><br/>I'm glad I'm not the only one to see it."

","I watched this film after hearing rave reviews from friends about how good it was. ""Good"" (at least in the moral sense) however is not a word I would use to describe this film. I have rarely felt so disturbed and dismayed.<br/><br/>Instead of following the usual overdone superhero theme Kick-Ass tries to take a new seemingly cooler edge. Not only is the superhero not a ""true"" superhero, but the film tries to shock by taking the level of violence to the depraved. If I had wanted to watch torture, a man being burnt alive, an 11 year old girl getting shot, beaten up and shooting others, repeated stabbings and copious amounts of blood, gore and knuckle dusters I'd have rented a slasher movie. I actually had to fast forward some scenes and look away because they were just too disturbing to watch. I found the violence in Kick-Ass to be abhorrent and frankly unnecessary, even though the film relies upon it in order to shock and remain edgy. <br/><br/>I am glad however that the violence affected me, at least it proves I still have empathy and a sense of morality. Something which I believe this film lacks in its entirety. How is it right to portray this level of violence in a ""superhero"" film that will be seen by young kids despite the 15 stamp purely because of its genre? Especially when the world is full of people shooting and beating up each other. Kick-Ass might have been different if the characters had reacted to what they were doing in an emotional and consequential way...but they just keep killing like it doesn't matter. As a society we really need to think about the messages films like Kick-Ass are sending out to children and indeed to adults."
"jfgibson73","5","1","6","29 July 2013"," Another Comic Adaption
","I was entertained by this movie, but a little disappointed as well. The beginning of the movie felt like I was seeing something different, and with all the superhero/comic movies being made now, it would be an accomplishment for someone to make one that felt like it had a unique perspective on the the genre. I think that for a little while, the fact that the movie has an R rating is what made it feel different, since the dialog didn't have to be as clean. I enjoyed most of the setup of the movie, with the kid becoming a hero and getting closer to the girl. Mid-way through the movie, we get the back story of Nicholas Cage's character, and the plot then becomes a typical action story (ex-cop turned vigilante trying to bring down big city drug lord???) It was the first big letdown, going from something fresh and different to a story we've heard a million times. The filmmakers keep it up in the air a little longer with the subplot about the gangleader's son becoming Red Mist and the ambiguity as to what he really wants. I wasn't sure if the kid wanted to really help his dad, or if he would break away and join Kick Ass. By the end, it really does turn into a by-the-numbers action movie with a climax ripped off from another big dumb action movie, True Lies. I think some viewers think that the fact that one of the characters was an 11 year old girl doing martial arts and killing lots of bad guys made this movie ""surprising"" or ""original,"" but under the surface, it was nothing new."
"bjhadse","5","1","6","23 September 2011"," An Acceptably Average Action-Comedy.
","Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) always wanted to be a super hero. For the life of him he couldn't understand why nobody ever tried to be one. A few online purchases (and a whole lot of nerve) later, and he's become ""Kick-Ass."" After a few unsuccessful bouts of crime-fighting, he becomes an internet sensation, inspiring a slew of equally flamboyant superheroes to take to the streets.<br/><br/>I neither understand the incredible critical praise nor the stern moral condemnation that this film has received. It struck me as neither good or lewd enough to illicit either response. Yes, the language was very, very foul, yes it glorified violence (especially in pre-teens) and yes it did, at least to some degree, sexualize an eleven year old actress (although it did so more comedically than seriously, given that Hit girl being ""hot"" was the punchline of at least one joke). The language was no worse than any number of other movies, only this time they came from a little girl. That too was part of the film, that such vulgarity came from such an unlikely source. As for glorifying violence, it is a super-hero movie, after all. It's simply following genre expectations. While I will admit that it was at times a little extreme (when Big Daddy and Hit girl handcuff a man to a car, put him in a running car compacter), it does so in its capacity as a comedy (presenting a caricature of Batman-esque violence). In short, it doesn't transgress arbitrary moral boundaries any more than any number of other films have already done.<br/><br/>As for the praise, I just don't see why. The movie was entertaining, but that was all. The plot, while functional, was more than a little uninspired: Dave and Katie (Lyndsy Fonseca) get together because she thinks that he's gay and always wanted a gay best friend. The acting oscillates from perfectly average (mot of the main characters) to completely inept (most of the minor characters). The dialog was jilted and awkward, even by the standard of teen romances; Aaron Johnson and Lyndsy Fonseca have a unique anti-chemistry between them that just doesn't get the job done. These flaws might not sink the film, but it does little more than keep it afloat.<br/><br/>For all of its negative qualities, however, it does accurately portray the cult-like fascination modern culture has with superheroes (even the most incompetent of them): meme-like fandom followed by a plethora of imitators. It gives us, if nothing else, a pathetic lens through which we can view what our own dreams of super heroism would look like.<br/><br/>The film's apropos use music and genuinely impressive fight choreography are perhaps its most strikingly positive qualities. Their conjunctive use, however, create a lackluster tension between comedy and action. Sadly, the film never really excels in either genre. Fans of most contemporary comedies, superhero culture and perhaps mass communication as well should find ""Kick-Ass"" at least passingly enjoyable."

","Kick-Ass wastes no time in establishing itself as a superhero comedy film with a clear and precise intention of what it is.The opening scene sets the tone for one of the most daring,funny,exhilarating and downright funny experiences you will ever have watching a film. The script is witty and knowing and while the film dodges 'movie' clichés at every turn,it does a great job of embracing and riffing on clichés within the context of the superhero genre.The idea of the superhero vigilante has been done to death with Batman and Watchmen in recent years,but neither of those films manage to come close to being nearly half as fun as Kick-Ass.Remember films like My Super Ex Girlfriend? Well forget them now, this is how to have fun with superheroes. Another interesting success within Kick Ass is that it knows the world can be an evil place and it doesn't shy away from the darkness. There are tough scenes within this film,but levity is never trailing too far behind. The last word must go to Hit Girl. I have never seen a film in which i have come away feeling as thought the 11 year old girl was the coolest thing on screen. I have now. 10/10"

","Just back from Kick-Ass and all i can say is WOW what a blast, this has to be one of the best superhero movies ever made, dare i say it ""its up there with The Dark Knight"". The basic premise is simple, what we have is a geek that dreams of being a superhero, then one day he finally builds up the courage to go out there and fight crime, however he is very rusty around the edge's because he has no real training and therefor gets his Ass-Kicked from time to time, but the kid has heart.. He then comes across too other superhero's (Big Dady & Hit Girl) but they are the real deal, and they have been trained well especially Hit Girl. So what follows are these crime busting hero's who are out to get the bad guys and when the action hits, it hits hard. Not only does it work as a great action film it also works as a great comedy, and one of the cool things about the movie is that we really do care about the characters and what they go through. The overall look of the film is very slick, the violence in some parts are brutal but fun, and some of the set pieces towards the end are just OTT, but it all merges perfectly in the confinements of this beautiful comic book world.. This comes highly recommended, hope they bring out a sequel..."

","Undoubtedly Kick Ass exceeded my expectations for the film. I thought it was likely to be shallow and in most parts cheesy. However I was pleasantly surprised with a comic and relatively in depth plot. All was well in this film until the introduction of ""Big Daddy"" poorly casted as Nicholas Cage. Why oh why he keeps on taking on these ridiculous roles that do not suit his acting style beats me. For me he isn't a great actor and especially is NOT suited to this role! National Treasure is the only film bar maybe Face Off which Cage is decent. He defiantly is not in Kick Ass and as a whole does in my opinion let the film down. <br/><br/>Apart from this Hick-up however the film is on the whole very good with a good mix of with the main plot and other sub narratives.

"johnnyboyz","6","1","7","15 March 2011"," Never mind Kicking-Ass, Vaughn's latest is a kicking; screaming; thrashing assault on the senses which miraculously happens to be both pleasing and rather substantial.
","Matthew Vaughn's outlandish and somewhat squeamish 2010 film Kick-Ass makes the grade for sheer energy and unabashed outlandishness, a near-on two hour assault through all things in bad taste and devilishly daring content, delivered through this somewhat perverse filter of dark reds; purples; light greens accompanied by streaks of yellows as well as coldly metallic whites blended with grey. The film isn't so much about the things that it wants to say as much as it is the way in which it goes about saying them, something that dogs the film come the final act but until then remains an unabashed and full on blackly comedic onslaught of sadistic gangsters; disgruntled young men; elusive young women; sickly amusing juxtapositions and a whole lot of off-the-cusp content.<br/><br/>Kick-Ass tells the tale of two males, one coming out of adolescence as his high-school days fritter away and his life situation appears to get worse by the day; the other a much older man, a discontent ex-cop whom was wrongfully imprisoned and is now seeking revenge in the harsh, unforgiving, intimidating basin that is modern day New York City. The adolescent is David Lizewski (Johnson), a boy living with his father following his mother's passing, not in control of his hormones and mostly living a self-identified pathetic existence consisting of being rolled over by bullies; rejected by girls, particularly young Katie (Fonseca), and mixing it with his teen-aged friends at internet cafés and comic book shops. We observe him during a tracking shot down a school corridor, in slow motion, which accentuates their characteristics and place in life. They look around uneasily at their surroundings, sport nervous smiles which feign confidence and look a little weedy. His point of attack is generically reminiscent to that of your more bog-standard high-school comedy, during which the presence of Christopher Mintz-Plasse's Chris D'Amico, son of a local mafia kingpin, is encompassed with his own, more exquisite introduction seeing him step out of a limousine: he's been here before in 2007's Superbad, and consequently has his star-system reputation toyed with by the film as being a veteran to all this content.<br/><br/>David shares some duality with a certain Damon Macready, played by Nicolas Cage. Macready cuts an odd figure, sporting prim glasses and a tall figure; his big, bushy moustache standing him out amidst proceedings as he encourages young daughter Mindy (Moretz) to learn the art of hand to hand combat via gunshots to well protected chests; pop quizzes on heavy artillery and lessons in using knifes. She goes on to become the purple-haired; skirt wearing; ninja weapon wielding Hit-Girl, one of the more eye-opening characters from a film from recent years. Both men fight a system, a large governing body of people too corrupt to especially care for the results of their actions, the system failing to clean up the neighbourhood which Dave inhabits, as well as incorrectly sentencing MacReady to a stretch in prison. When we discover what it is Macready is fighting for, in an affecting scene, Vaughn constructs a particular character's epiphany in discovering the true extent to what happened as if inadvertently uncovering a serial killer's lair, complete with mandatory diary full of disdain and hatred, and the desired reaction is accomplished.<br/><br/>The nature of Dave's existence pushes him to order a costume over the Internet so as to enable him to go out and test a thesis he himself concocted more broadly linked to that of why it is super-heroes do not exist. The anger, dishevelment and frustrations born out of the hand life has dealt young Dave sees him long to escape such a persona, or existence, and venture out into another one: one is toothless and somewhat of a target to those whom prey; the other, complete with costume, a mysterious, overly bold, anonymous and quite violent creation born out of his situation in life. We feel Dave is at rock bottom and when he's on the roof top of a five story building practising leaping from top-to-top, before urgently pulling out of the final jump, we do still feel that that's a suicide attempt which doesn't materialise more than a potential vigilante practising super-heroism. Eventually, his popularity with the public sees his fame sky-rocket; his first taste at super-heroism sees him fail overall but his actions get him closer to Katie, so he continues.<br/><br/>Later on, their framework encompasses the realising of the importance of sticking to one's true identity; Dave coming to reject his online, super-hero, 'fake' persona as Katie herself realises the shallowness of her own attitudes in initially deducing Dave to be 'of an ilk', before coming round to seeing what sort of guy he is after naturally bonding with him. The argument that it is a character piece and not an adolescent display of gratuity continues when we recall the early, slow track of Dave-plus-friends and match that up beside and a later composition of Dave looking beaten; bloodied; grubbier and less than smart following the plodding through his dangerous misadventure.<br/><br/>Vaughn's film is a delicate balance of coming of age with the tale of full on revenge against a system, but to say it goes about exploring its themes, ideas and stories in a delicate manner would be wholly misleading; the film a jaunty and engrossing enough action/comedy tackling notions of one's identity in a contemporary, digitally driven universe and encompassing a fair deal of characterisation in the process, resulting in a film not really as substantial nor as adventurous as either of Vaughn's previous two pieces, but regardless something with the ability to stand on its own. He keeps both strands moving along at equal pace, Cage's is more engrossing; the film paying sly hint to knowing so when it utilises the concoction of Hit-Girl to drive the film's final act on behalf of Cage's plight. Moral panics and general outrage aside, Kick-Ass is an engrossing and substantial enough film to get involved in."

Low rating because the ending was totally disappointing and compromised the deliverance of a good bang at the end for the redemption of the nerdywhiteteenager as a hero. The ending was really more of a petering out than a resolution. Overall: fight scenes with technically great with good music and style, hit-girl's character was fresh and amusing.

","You know you have a bad superhero movie when you want the ""cute, spunky, supposedly bad-ass little girl heroine"" to be kicked in the face by the villain. Which eventually happens and it was great. That sounds horrible but that's really how much I disliked that girl. It was very sad how the most hyped thing about this movie was Chloe Moretz as Hit-Girl and she is easily one of the worst things about the movie. They tried way too hard to make her character funny. But it just came off as incredibly stupid to have an 11 year old kid swear and murder people. This was a surprisingly unfunny movie. Me and my friends watched this tonight because we had nothing to do. And it was not worth my Saturday night. It was extremely dumb. It's not comparable to movies like Final Destination and Billy Madison, which are so dumb they can't help but make you laugh. This movie got zero laughs from my entire group of friends. I honestly don't understand why this has gotten an 8.1 on IMDb, but to each his own. In my opinion, there were few redeemable things about this movie. One was Christopher Mintz-Plasse--who should have been in more of the movie than he was. The actor who played Kick-Ass also wasn't bad, he just wasn't as funny as he could have been. Which was probably more the writer's fault than the actor's. Also, the violence was too much. I'm definitely not squeamish by any standards and I personally like violence in movies...when it works. The action in this movie was the same in every fight scene and seeing a little girl stabbing grown men and cutting off their legs is just frankly uncomfortable. And very stupid. Did I mention that? I really would not recommend this movie if you are looking for laughs. It is supposed to be campy, quirky, and Superbad-like. However, it came off as dumb, unnecessarily violent and gross, and lacking in the hilarity that many reviews promise."
"Cyck1","6","1","7","7 August 2010"," Ever want to love something more then you did?
","Kick-Ass is the most recent addition to a slew of self-aware, homage/spoof ""makeshift"" films that have been all the rage this decade (Shaun of The Dead, Zombieland, Pineapple Express, etc.). That fact alone would make plenty of people, myself included, WANT to love this movie. We love seeing the familiar concepts of our childhood films about monsters and heroes re-imagined with less romanticism and more unapologetic realism. The magic behind these kinds of films are their ability to cater to the kid in us by way of the nostalgia factor while gratifying our adult need for logic, irony, moral ambiguity and all that jazz. Its almost therapeutic. So just bear in mind that Kick-Ass is the sort of movie that I want to fully enjoy and would be more inclined to give ""extra credit"" if it didn't completely live up to expectation.<br/><br/>With that out of the way I can say that every scene that takes place in Kick-Ass that doesn't involve a costume in some way, shape, or form is almost unwatchable. Dave's (the kid who becomes the title character Kick-Ass) monologues are grating and uninteresting. I realize in part that this was the idea since he is supposed to be an average, slightly geeky kid but one should write average and geeky in a likable manner. You can't be uninteresting in an uninteresting way when you're the main character. The writing should delight us with his ineptitude when in actuality it just makes us yawn. The dialogue will attempt to make you laugh but it won't. Nothing anyone says is funny. A little girl swearing dead-pan isn't funny. You have to make it funny by way of delivery.<br/><br/>Speaking of delivery To say that the acting is bad would be a bit inaccurate. Its more like the acting isn't there. All the performances lack energy and an inkling of effort. This doesn't just include the child actors and actresses of course as the criminals in Kick-Ass are laughably unconvincing as well. I'm guessing the fact that they're ethnic, cuss and kill people was supposed to be enough for us to believe they were the real deal. That's just not how it works. Compare these mafia clowns in their mafia suits to the thugs in Sopranos or Goodfellas and marvel at the difference. Bottom line, no performance based on talent alone (not the way the character is dressed) is going to leave an impression apart from Nicholas Cage and Christopher Mintz-Plasse (Red Mist).<br/><br/>The scenes that involve people wearing costumes and doing hero work represent an entirely different side of Kick-Ass. A more watchable side. Between the child-knifings and the microwaving (you read right), much of the violence in Kick-Ass will leave you baffled at just how to feel about it. I've decided this is a good thing. The action delights and horrifies us at the same time with some extremely brutal and morally conflicting moments that will bring the viewer into a Natural Born Killers' state of mind. Not only is the violence refreshing but in many cases the action is brilliantly shot. One particular scene I love is when Big Daddy (Cage) is executing a room full of mobsters and we see him, dressed in Batman-ish garb, running furiously and clumsily up the stairs to finish off a retreating thug that he just shot. That scene alone represents everything Kick-Ass should be; that is, shocking vigilante justice mixed in with very goofy and very ""human"" effort.<br/><br/>But, sad to say, even the action scenes weren't a complete hit. I need to talk about the use of music in this movie and how director Matthew Vaughn isn't good at it. You get the impression that he took notes from Scorsese, Tarantino and Kubrick and tried to use unexpected music to draw more ""oomph"" from his scenes just like them. The problem is Kick-Ass's music always cues up far too early and always peaks at the climax of a scene with action or brutality. This ends up working against the film because the audience will start to know exactly when something gross or awesome is going to happen just by listening to the music. I think that this destroys the tension of most of the scenes rather then builds it up. Music used in that sense obviously can build up a scene if we are talking subtle orchestra strings, but in Kick-Ass's case the track selection is often over-powering and distracting, pulling the audience out of the movie and away from the tension even further. Not to mention the fact that the variety in the music and the order in which it is played is sometimes jarring. Playing ""An American Trilogy"" mere moments after playing Pop-rock hit ""Bad Reputation""? Not a smart move.<br/><br/>And while the plot is mostly engaging they're more then a few eye rolling moments in the script. Moments like when Kick-Ass randomly gets the girl, Hit Girl's entire character, and the idea that a teenage boy can at one moment completely freak out over a dead body and the next Gatling gun down an entire room full of people without flinching it absolutely clashes with the idea that this film is supposed to be a ""realistic"" look at what might happen if costumed crime-fighting ever surfaced.<br/><br/>So it comes down to the simple fact that there is more things to not like about Kick-Ass then there is to like. The violence in this film is hearty and not soon to be forgotten. Everything else the film does badly, being loud when it should be quiet and being obnoxious when it should be charming. Look up Super Bad to see how Kick-Ass should have handled high-school humor and look up Kill Bill to see how it should have meshed music selection with ultra-violence."

","Kick Ass is undoubtedly one of the best films of the year, and we haven't even reached July yet! The hype surrounding this film truly was real, and didn't seem a tall like a con. If you want action, then you get action, in bucket loads. The violence is served in a comedic and brutal style that is pure brilliance to watch. It delivers again and again, without making you wait, or feel bored- not in Kick Ass! The comedy i also thought worked exceedingly well, and at the most unusual of places. To sum Kick Ass up, it is a full throttle roller-coaster ride that will have you gagging for more and more, and gives it to you upfront in what is surely to go down as one of the best films of the year."

","How is this movie rated so high is a complete mystery to me. I guess it's all because of poor taste of today's audience which gets so easily fascinated with anything that appears somehow 'inovative'. I was expected to see an excellent satire of geek's fascination with superheroes and some cleverly brought points and gegs, but what I get was just another stupid action-superhero movie with tons of unnecessary violence. Instead of introducing us more into Kick-ass character played by very likeble actor (he was the only reason why I watched this painful movie to the end), we become surrounded by clichés seen hundred times before in Tarantino movies, Watchmen, Incredibles, only with more added violence and gore. Right after the scene with drug dealers whole movie goes downhill, unable to decide what it wants to be: heartbreaking drama, bloody action movie or comedy? Besides all of that it becomes incredibly boring, just introducing more stupid evil characters, but the worst of all is that underaged 'superhero' girl which perfectly shows the creative and mental weakness of those behind this movie. Kickass's girlfriend is also a shameful cardboard cutout. Why does nobody know how to write female characters anymore? They are just extremely boring or extremely violent and swearing with sexual connotations! Miserable!"

","Kick Ass is a film desperately looking for an identity. It layers poor music choices over its action sequences which ruins any suspense or interest. It isn't funny enough to be a black comedy.<br/><br/>It isn't serious enough, or structured comprehensively, to be a good action-adventure. It's shallow for a teen-self awareness message. Motivation for some of the main characters are non-existent or contradictory. There are a few story detours without purpose.<br/><br/>The performances of the actors are miss-matched .. a few are terrific, some are not passable.. The violence is bloody, and at times very brutal. But it isn't a slasher film.<br/><br/>If mindless, bloody movies without a point is your thing, then you got it ...

","I saw this movie a few months ago because it looked cool in previews. I'd also heard from many people that it was great. After watching it and then seeing how others felt I was shocked. This movie was BAD. The story and romance were cliché, the characters were poorly developed and not very likable, the acting was godawful especially by that idiot Nicholas Cage, and the other part I enjoyed was the cinematography. The movie itself is all over the place... first about a kid who wants to impress a girl and fight crime, then it becomes about completely different actual 'superheroes'. A movie that features a father who teaches his daughter to murder people is a little absurd... and the amount of people they kill is baffling. Horribly cliché, stereotypical teen movie about being unpopular and then about action and killing.<br/><br/>See this movie if you are: a prepubescent emo kid.

"GrizzlyJoe","9","1","8","25 May 2010"," Make up your own minds...
","I'm not usually a fan of violent films. I found Sin City, while artistically and stylistically interesting, kinda nauseating with the violence and the gore. Oddly enough not so with Kick-Ass. For some reason I was not only OK with it - I appreciated it. <br/><br/>Kick-Ass is a fantasy film. It examines power, corruption, lies, deception, honour and love. It speaks of the pain of powerlessness and the hidden desires many of us have to simply fight back against those who would intimidate and possibly destroy us. <br/><br/>I won't go into the plot. There are many reviews here that will explain that to you. Nor will I bother to moralize about HitGirl's language or violence. Like I said, this is a fantasy film. She is a fictional character and to equate her with any 11yo living is simply ridiculous.<br/><br/>I've read reviews here that would place all sorts of filters on the film - sociological, political, moral - but they're ALL missing the point. It's a fantasy. A dream. It's make-believe and it's a hell of a lot of fun. See it and make up your own mind."
"moviesleuth2","8","1","8","10 May 2010"," Fun superhero movie
","People have been saying that ""Kick-Ass"" turns the superhero genre on its ear. While it's true that the set-up adds a certain level of verisimilitude to the film, the need to have a story turns it into just another superhero origin story, save for a few throw-away lines and gags to make it more real. That doesn't mean it isn't fun, however.<br/><br/>Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) is your normal teenager. He's a comic book lover, but that's about as far as he goes in terms of being out of the ordinary. He's so normal that he's just about invisible. One day he starts wondering why no one has donned a costume and become a superhero. If you really think about it, it really shouldn't take much. So Dave buys a wetsuit and becomes Kick-Ass. Before long, he becomes a phenomenon, inspiring a father/daughter team (Nicholas Cage and Chloe Moretz), and attracting the attention of a wealthy drug kingpin (Mark Strong).<br/><br/>The best thing that the movie has is its realism. ""Kick-Ass"" tries to be as realistic as possible in terms of what would happen if a normal kid tried vigilantism. It's not a pretty sight. Dave isn't invincible, and neither are any of the other superheroes; when someone gets hit, it hurts...a lot! However, I didn't think it went far enough. I mean, wouldn't the police be able to track him down with forensic science? That would lead to some interesting complications.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, it's still a lot of fun. All the actors perform in an understated way. I often criticize movies for doing this, but it works here. Aaron Johnson makes for a good pubescent superhero. His voice frequently cracks, and so on. But Johnson is a good performer. Nicholas Cage is a little off-the-wall (as Cage is wont to do), but the understated way of acting keeps him restrained enough from doing anything too outlandish. Mark Strong makes for a surprisingly good villain. And Christopher Mintz-Plasse does what you'd expect him to: he's like Foegel in ""Superbad"" (his star-making role), only a lot less geeky and oblivious.<br/><br/>There has been a lot of controversy surrounding this film, and a lot of that has to do with Chloe Moretz, who plays Mindy, aka ""Hit Girl"" (quite well, by the way). People were shocked at the profanity she utters. Nothing was said about the people she kills (a number so high that it would make Ah-nuld blush). Conservatives are always complaining about how we've lost our moral values. They should check this movie out, and then see which is more disturbing.<br/><br/>This movie is a lot of fun (adults only...the film actually gets the rating it deserves, for once). Nothing is taken too seriously, yet it's never too cheeky, either. However, character development is a little too low for the film to work completely. Dave is in over his head from day one, and he knows it. But he needs more development for us to really feel it. And while the film doesn't completely break the mold of the superhero genre, that doesn't mean it's not a good movie anyway."

","So I really wanted to see this movie because the trailer had been on the t.v nonstop and the movie looked fun. I never got to see it in theaters, but when it came out on DVD I sat down to watch expecting to have a few good laughs. The movie didn't start out that bad. Towards the beginning, the message I was getting from the movie was that there was injustice in the world and nobody was trying to fight it. I thought the movie was about being your own hero. And then HitGirl arrived. I really do like Chloe Moretz (the girl who plays HitGirl). I think she is a promising actress... but this was not one of her best films. In real life she's thirteen. In the movie, I think she's supposed to be eleven. On her first scene, HitGirl goes wild and kills these scary looking men in a very ungirly and unreal manner. It was really just hard to believe. Not to mention that one of her first lines in that god awful purple wig involved her saying the C word, which utterly shocked me. From then on, I started getting bored. I never finished watching the movie, I just went to Wikipedia and read the ending. The bloody gore and the raunchy language was really just too much, especially when the perpetrator was a young girl. It ruined the movie. Period. From the looks of it, the director was trying way to hard to get an audience."

","When you were just a kid, did you ever wish to be a superhero? I think all the kids who were born in 1980s onward would ever desire about that, at least once. Thiz movie is very confident since the beginning, they advertise it rapidly and the posters are very attractive as well. It's about Dave (Aaron Johnson), an unpopular and nerdy boy who wants to be a superhero even without super power. He tries to save the world with the alter-ego named Kick-Ass, to do otherwise he get his ass kicked. Meanwhile, there are Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) and her eleven-year-old daughter named Hit-Girl (Chloë Grace Moretz) who have been the real superheroes, fighting the crime against drug dealer mob Frank D'Amico (Mark strong). Frank attempts to put his son, Chris (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) as undercover superhero named Red Mist, his intention is to capture Kick-Ass. Aaron Johnson delivers standard performance. Nicolas Cage provides a strong and comical figure. It's Chloë Grace Moretz who surprises us with believable and easy-going performance. Hit-Girl's fight scene is one of the awesome moments (we know that she's probably replaced by stunt double, but it's still awesome!), furthermore she is also good in drama.Once again, Mark Strong successfully brings an interesting villain character. Recently, he was also a bad guy in ""RocknRolla"" (2008), ""The Young Victoria"" (2009), ""Sherlock Holmes"" (2009) and ""Robin Hood"" (2010). In every occasion, he could deliver different bad guy character with his aura and I admire him for that. In fact, I will officially give him appreciation as ""Bad Guy of the Year"". The Director is Matthew Vaughn who directed ""Stardust"" (2004) and the respectable ""Layer Cake"" (2007). Actually on thiz movie, the conversation is a little bit rude (as family movie) and the fight scene is kind of bloody brutal, but we have to admit the story is original and effectively hilarious. The movie is brave enough to challenge the mainstream and it works well in most of the times. In my point of view, when we dare enough to laugh on ourself for our own stupidity or feebleness, that's the time we actually show the big heart of us.<br/><br/>Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com"
"thesteve34","8","1","9","10 May 2010"," Kicks ass. Literally.
","When I first heard of the release of this film, I thought ""Oh here we go again, another teen comedy trying desperately to make audiences laugh with it's cheesy gags and stupid plot line"". I was expecting an absolute nightmare; but I've never been so wrong. From start to finish, it perfectly blends action, violence and satirical comedy all into one nicely wrapped package, delivered first class. Mintz-Plasse, possibly the tastiest sounding name in show business, gives a truly sublime performance as the lead bumbling teenager who tries to become a super hero in the modern world, without thinking of the consequences. Even his co-stars, young Moretez and Cage sparkle as father and daughter; with a infamous reference to Adam West's classic Batman which he depicts to perfection. Now, onto the violence. And my God, is it violent. From a man being roasted in a fire alive, to a guy being blown out of a building by a bazooka, it has absolutely everything for action fans to feast they're hungry eyes on. Seeing it's blood thirsty nature, you really do wonder why it's certificated a fifteen, but then of course, it's not violence. It's COMIC violence. Or that's what it says on the tin. This film is no Ronseal, as it goes into much darker issues from just good vs. bad, appealing to a much wider audience. So what have we learnt? That anyone can be a super hero? No. This film is simply fantasy in the real world, with it's tongue in cheek humour and extremely graphic fighting scenes, it delivers a thrill ride that teeters on the edge of over the top. Just want we to see. Kicks Ass. Literally."

","A somewhat unlikely mating of Juno, Kill Bill, and Fight Club culminate in the ugly duckling brother of Watchmen. The rather cute and bloody sibling does not disappoint; and it's not what one would expect from trailers and previous movies about superheroes. The movie delivers an action-packed thrill ride, while breaking the mold of tried and true action films of past. Kick-Ass gets an 'R' rating, and though some scenes seem to pull off an almost Disney- esquire, feel-good vibe, it's not one for the kiddies. But if you can get a baby sitter and silence your prude inner-self, there's one hell of a smart and witty showing, within this fun, if slightly overcast, film.<br/><br/>It begins with the typically troubled geeky-boy character (Aaron Johnson) finding himself as a superhero, Kick-Ass. In his new line of work he soon meets Big Daddy and Hit-Girl: two 'real deal' superheroes very capable and very lethal in what they do. He is drawn into taking down a New York City Mob-Boss (Mark Strong of Stardust), and struggles to simultaneously fight crime and keep his normal life in order. On the way, he also meets Red Mist (McLovin of Superbad), another superhero who is similarly struggling within his own life. Through the vertigo of his new life, Kick-Ass soon realizes that he's gotten himself deeper into the crime-fighting business than he ever wanted to be, and in life or death circumstances is forced to decide whether he wants to be a normal guy the rest of his life, or become a hero.<br/><br/>Director Mathew Vaughn layers sadness, humor, and slightly startling violence within a story of growing up and taking down bad guys. Based on the comic book by Mark Miller, the movie carries over some fascinating cinematography, and exciting ideas. Kick-Ass, for example, is very in-your-face and brutally physical, and his scenes show it. The lovable Hit-Girl swears like a sailor and kills like 300's Leonidas; and as kick-ass as she is, she just isn't the cute little girl you somehow want her to be. And Big Daddy, while his SWAT-like movement and Kung-Fu fighting skills are awe-inspiring, his loving nature still brings a tear to your eye. All of the components of a typical action movie are present, but with all new characters and ideas blended together in a fresh fun take on the classic in this yummy-licious cut-throat-mocha frappe-jolly eccentric-cino. <br/><br/>Kick-Ass leaves a nostalgic, almost melancholy taste in your mouth, and a longing for the earlier days when time was spent entertaining the idea of becoming a real-life superhero. It's got fantastic style, showered across fun characters and an engaging story line. This is the joy ride of the year, careening past inhibitions and breaking through limits; smiles all around. Though a parody of sorts of the very genre it assimilates to, Kick-Ass is a surprisingly good addition to the current superhero movie lineup. If only to compare to other superhero movies out there (Spiderman, Batman, Iron Man) and to the comic book days of old, it's worth a viewing just to discuss with the mates. Though not an instant classic, Kick-Ass looks like an abstract art gallery, sounds like a late-night comedy show, and kills like a video-game. A"

We kept saying, this is awesome but f-ed up! It's the same feeling you get watching The Professional, its heartwarming, the performances are great, the story is riveting...but its f-ing brutal and you're watching a child, a young girl be trained to be a psychopath! The difference here is its not voluntary, its a life she's born into. It seems right but its so sad and so wrong! <br/><br/>It's definitely an interesting twist on what you'd think would be a straight forward goofy teenage comedy.

Then, the plot became interesting as the ""Hit Girl"" and ""Big Daddy"" character arcs came in to play.

"nazztrader","7","1","9","21 April 2010"," It's not easy to assess this one !
","This had the potential to be a great film, but it went astray, especially the ending. However, let me start at the beginning. The portrayal of a geeky high school guy wanting to become a ""super hero"" and learning, ""the hard way,"" that it isn't very realistic (and quite dangerous) is fairly well done. It paves the way perfectly for the real ""super heroes,"" who are a bit mentally imbalanced, to put it nicely. The bloody and gruesome, yet comical scene of Hit Girl killing a bunch of thugs and low-lifes is the high point of the film. The problem then becomes where to go from there.<br/><br/>First I'll talk about the issues I had with the actual film, then I'll offer an alternative idea. There were too many characters who were given enough time to get the audience interested in them, yet not enough time to do anything else. None of the characters were ""developed"" to a sufficient degree for me, actually. At the end, we are asked to believe that Hit Girl has no ""emotional scars"" and can just be a ""normal"" child. I would have at least changed that ending so that when confronted by bullies who want her lunch money (I would have made the bullies girls rather than boys), she just gives it to them as says something like, ""no problem; remember that violence never solves anything."" However, I would prefer to see the film go in a very different direction after Hit Girl's first scene of slaughter. Big Daddy and Hit Girl talk about Kick-Ass and decide that they should mentor him, or at least make him realize that he's going to get himself killed at some point, because they won't be there to come to the rescue every time he gets himself into trouble. They take him on one of their missions after giving him some ""training,"" and he kills a ""bad guy"" who was about to kill him. When he gets back home he realizes he doesn't have the demeanor to do such things, even in the case of self defense, because he should have never put himself in that position in the first place.<br/><br/>He develops a love interest at the same time and struggles with the violence that he will have to be exposed to if he continues on the ""super hero"" path. This, in combination with his self defense killing, leads him not only to quit, but to think about how he can rescue Hit Girl from her father's indoctrination. He gets to know her a bit and realizes she has no social skills nor any other interest in life. It is a ""sick"" relationship she has with her obsessed father. He contacts social services and tells them what's going one, and they have him wear a wire to get evidence against Big Daddy. BD discovers what KA is planning to do, and he and HG abduct KA. HG doesn't realize that BD wants to kill KA and dispose of his body so that it is never found, but HG intervenes when KA tells her about the world beyond the ""super hero"" lifestyle, when BD is out doing something. So, at the end, BD is in a mental institution, HG is in school and doing well, though getting counseling, and KA is living a ""normal"" life with his ""normal""-looking girl friend."

I was very surprised with ""hit girl"" performance. Some of the things you see are a little out there but well done none the less. The plot actually had some meaning and depth and turned into quite a serious movie. Nicholas Cage doesn't share too much screen time but when he does it is quite memorable. The music and atmosphere would get intense at times which gave the movie more props. If you watched the trailer you are getting something more than you would expect as that is all I have seen and knew nothing else about it. It contained a lot of teen humor and adult humor. The action sequences and gun fights were excellent. There were only a few moments in the movie where I thought ""ok now this would never happen"" but it didn't take away too much from my viewing pleasure. I am giving this movie an 8/10 simply because it started this summer out excellent with more great movies to come this year and if you in the mood for fun, laughter, and action, and Mclovin!

"dhorowitz-717-673250","7","1","9","20 April 2010"," Missed the message but had the spirit of the comic
","Saw this on Friday night and thought I'd have my hand at writing a review. Actionwise, the movie was fantastic. I couldn't have possibly expected more and it really captures the mood/tone of the comic perfectly. Of course, certain things like Kick Ass getting his balls electrocuted by a car battery, Hit Girl doing coke, and taking out all uses of the word ""gay"" and ""faggot"" needed to be cut from the movie. But what really bothered me that was cut was the message. The pivotal scene in the comic is when Big Daddy admits that his back story about being an ex-cop was untrue, and that in reality he only forced Hit Girl into her life as a super hero because he didn't want her to grow up hooked on American Idol and actually wanted her to be special. By elevating the two beyond nerd status in the movie, the parallel with Kick Ass is entirely lost."
"ereg24","7","1","9","18 April 2010"," You take the good with the bad and what do you get?
","You get Kick-Ass. Definitely a movie with more good than bad, Kick-Ass is far from a perfect film.<br/><br/>Let me start by saying that this film is great fun, but not for everybody. While I personally had a fantastic time watching some of the more gratuitously violent scenes in film history, I would encourage anybody with a weak constitution for blood and dismemberment to skip this one (it is rated R for a very good reason).<br/><br/>What Kick-Ass offers is a surprisingly intelligent take on the idea of costumed heroism and an incredibly violent spin on your typical coming of age teen comedy. Throughout the wry satire movie patrons will find themselves on a roller coaster of crime fighting fun. Unfortunately this works to the films disadvantage. Kick-Ass is ultimately too concept driven for mass appeal, and when you couple the movies bipolar jumps from ultra violence to teenage sexual frustration with a rather simple story and you have a film that will be incredibly hard-pressed to win over the art house film buffs. Kick-Ass is (much like the films protagonist) in an awkward spot between mature and adult and trite and juvenile.<br/><br/>But if you fall into the films demographic you will find a very enjoyable experience. The acting is largely fantastic though I did find Christopher Mintz-Plasse's (Red Mist) performance to be very weak when placed next to Chloe Moretz (Hit Girl), who steels the show, and Nicholas Cage (Big Daddy), who delivers one of his best performances in recent years.<br/><br/>Ultimately Kick-Ass is a fun violence filled romp that I personally look forward to adding into my movie collection. That being said it's a move that keeps closer company with Transformers than The Dark Knight. I cannot stress enough how this film is violent but if the idea of an 11 year old girl slaughtering people amuses you than Kick-Ass just might be the best way to spend your day at the moves."
"brunokid2200","9","1","9","17 April 2010"," Amazing
","I had my doubts about Kick-Ass after seeing the trailers. It seemed like just another typical teenager/sex comedy. Yes, the movie does contain humor that could fit in to that category, but this movie was more than that. Kick-Ass starts with a very comedic tone and suddenly fades in to an in-your-face action film which..kicks ass. First off, this movie is NOT a child-friendly film. It contains extremely graphic violence mostly involving the 11 year old, Hit-Girl. The storyline of this movie grabs you from the beginning. It follows a story of revenge involving Big Daddy and Hit-Girl. This movie is very funny but overall, a solid action film. This kills are crazy, the tone is just so hardcore, and the laughs keep coming throughout the whole film. This movie is a must-see for anyone who enjoys action, comedy, and drama. Overall: fantastic movie."

There is mild nudity that pops up for maybe a second and (*spoiler alert*) *there is a 5 to 10 second scene in which Kick-A## has intercourse with his girlfriend in an ally.*<br/><br/>Don't let this stop you from seeing the movie.

I'll be honest in that some elements of the story seemed like cheats, especially the ending shot. But these short-cuts are totally acceptable for the brilliant moments of genius comedy that flood the movie. I'd also like to say that Nic Cage is tremendous as Big daddy, showing his true diversity as an actor once again. To sum up this film.....I'm sorry to say it again....KICK'S ASS!"
"rick_7","Null","1","10","11 June 2010"," This original superhero flick starts superbly, but peters out
","Kick-Ass (Matthew Vaughn, 2010) is an original, entertaining fusion of teen comedy and superhero movie that stops firing on all cylinders when its guns start blazing. Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) is an ordinary American teenager who decides to become a superhero. He has no powers, aside from ""being invisible to girls"", but he does have a natty green costume, ordered online. After a spot of posing and some light training, the self-proclaimed Kick-Ass goes into action. Seeing two hoods trying to break into a car, he tackles them - and departs in an ambulance. Eventually, though, through a combination of resilience and dumb luck, our hero does attain local celebrity, along with the unwanted attentions of gangland kingpin Mark Strong, who thinks him responsible for a series of vigilante killings carried out by wronged ex-cop Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) and his foul-mouthed daughter Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz, who is terrific). Meanwhile, Strong's neglected son (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) decides he wants to get involved, and reinvents himself as the bequiffed Red Mist.<br/><br/>The film starts in an appealingly whimsical vein, its superbly-observed passages about teen life punctuated with blasts of graphic, realistic violence: one minute Lizewski is wrestling with love interest's Lyndsy Fonseca mistaken belief that he's gay, the next he's wrestling three armed men in the gutter. There's a superb moment in which Kick-Ass decides to leap between tall buildings, then thinks better of it, such subversion of comic book lore jostling for space with simpler pleasures, like two geeky teen superheroes dancing goofily to Gnarls Barkley's Crazy as they cruise the New York streets. But these more engaging elements are ultimately overtaken by cartoonish mayhem in a less imaginative, more gratuitous second half that - while fine in itself - largely abandons the excellent premise in favour of stylised gore. It's still a very worthwhile film, with well-drawn characters, a glorious sense of the unexpected and a dozen huge laughs."
"ClaytonDavis","6","1","10","26 April 2010"," Kick Asses of Entertainment
","From Matthew Vaughn, director of Stardust and Layer Cake, the man takes a stab at the comic book genre, Kick-Ass. While the film bodes well for entertainment and the average Friday night visit to the movies, Kick-Ass doesn't offer any heart and soul to withstand any real social or film-making significance. Vaughn seems to be very inspired by Quentin Tarantino's film style but rather then use it as a foundation, he copies it in the most awkward way and delivers second rate results.<br/><br/>With an ensemble of all up-and-comers, and Nicolas Cage, Kick-Ass enables its players to dig somewhat deep within themselves to bare real emotions, however, minimal delivery and story arch don't lead to any substantial moments. Of the players, Aaron Johnson who plays the brave superhero ""Kick-Ass"" carries the audiences affection. With his breakthrough performance in Nowhere Boy last year, Johnson will sure to be one of Hollywood's bright lights.<br/><br/>Chloe Moretz as the vulgar and spunky ""Hit-Girl"" is surely a fan favorite character, however, I found her character completely annoying. Her fight sequences, as most of the film, are simply awesome and red hot fire, but as soon as dialogue is shared with any of her co-stars, worst of all Nicolas Cage as ""Big Daddy,"" eyes roll. And what Nicolas Cage seems to be doing these days is stop trying altogether on acting. He's showing an eclectic taste in choosing movie roles which I can appreciate but he's lost all sight of what he showed us in the mid-90's when he won his Oscar for Leaving Las Vegas. He's stopped chasing that moment again.<br/><br/>Christopher Mintz-Plasse, or as you may know him better as ""McLovin"" from Superbad, remains his A-typical role with no acting range. As awesome as Mintz has been in his last roles, he seems to be locked in this type of ""struggling, teen depression angst"" performances. I'm waiting on something more.<br/><br/>As this looks like a negative review of Vaughn's film, my experience is not a bad one by any means. Kick-Ass is pure entertainment though a tad too long but it gets chuckles and smiles along the way. It shows something different which is worthy for a look.<br/><br/>**1/2/****"
"pulpreyes","6","1","10","20 April 2010"," Hilarious But Cheesier Than What It's Supposed to Be
","This is definitely a great popcorn film and something you can surely watch with all of your teenage or young adult friends for a good laugh. On a critical level however, there were several flaws that prevented the movie to be ""awesomely perfect."" This film was based on a graphic novel and as usual, the books are always better than the movie adaptations. If the movie had even more similarities with the graphic novel, it would have been far more enjoyable and trust me, even more hard-core. <br/><br/>The film tries to create different action scenes from the book which some worked and some sucked. An example of what worked was in the scene where Hit-Girl used night vision goggles to save Kick-Ass and Big Daddy, the POV shot was crazy and clever. What didn't work was the the big surprise that the movie was building up for... a jet pack. When I saw that I was thinking, ""Seriously Hollywood? Did you really need to include that?"" It made the hardcore action suddenly turn corny, which is something the graphic novel most definitely is not. It would've been better if Hit-Girl and Kick-Ass fought off the bad guys at the end with grittier weapons like the swords, the pistols, and the two sticks like in the book instead of a bazooka and a jet-pack. <br/><br/>I'm not saying the violence was bad, much of it was really bad-ass and awesome, but could've had a much better ending. Also, I was able to relate to Kick-Ass initially because he was a dork with big aspirations that always crush his hopes and desires; something we've all experienced. However, I lost that feeling once he actually gets the girl! What the hell? He basically turned into another Toby Maguire Spider-Man because he got the girl! The story would've been much more interesting and relatable to the audience if he didn't get what he wanted. <br/><br/>This film is very enjoyable action-comedy; I think Nicolas Cage as Big Daddy and Chloe Moretz as Hit-Girl were awesome. However, the movie really turns into another super-hero fantasy instead of being a film mocking that fantasy which would've been a much better approach. In short, Definitely check out the graphic novel if you ever get the chance."
"ludwig1800","1","1","11","13 June 2013"," Absolute garbage
","My friend lent me this movie a while back. Having heard so much about Kick-Ass, I was expecting hilarious moments and amazing action sequences. Boy was I wrong! The action scenes were completely ridiculous- the main action sequence involves Hit Girl dodging bullets and running up walls as well as reloading guns in mid-air; THE MATRIX, anyone? I wasn't even cheering for her. In fact, to me she was a complete b****. The movie might as well have been called ""Hit Girl"" instead of ""Kick Ass"".<br/><br/>I for one can't stand the movies of Tarantino (I didn't care for Inglorious Bastards at all). But in all honesty I would rather watch that again, and DOOM as well, than see Kick Ass. The over-the-top use of profanity, especially the C word, was completely unnecessary. The graphic violence was too much at times- it seems like this guy was doing nothing except trying to be another Quentin Tarantino.<br/><br/>I am so glad I didn't actually see this movie in the cinema, let alone rent it from the video store. Avoid like the plague my friends."

This film is also very funny and if you just want to laugh a lot, then give this film a try. I really want to see a sequel to this film, so if you haven't watched it--please give it a try, I promise you it will be worthwhile. Overall the acting was spectacular, the script was tight and funny, gory, teen-angsty all at the same time. Chloe Moretz as hit-girl and Aaron Johnson as Kick-Ass were the standouts of the film, although Nick Cage delivered a very humble and emotionally ranged performance. I couldn't recommend this enough. A perfect meal of a movie: plot, characters, themes and execution with twists and turns at every corner. The last scenes of the movie are killer and in the end Matthew Vaughan is a director to watch out for."

"vrijheidsdrang","6","1","12","27 February 2011"," Failed attempt to spoof the super-hero genre
","Can ordinary humans become a super hero? that is the theme question which Kick-Ass tries to answer. And for the first half our of the movie, I was positively surprised at the witty, intelligent and funny way in which Kick-Ass tries to answer this question. We witness an average teen try and fail and try again to test this hypothesis. As he gets smarter with every attempt, his luck changes and he actually achieves his desired super-hero status about half way through the movie.<br/><br/>At that point we get introduced to Super Daddy and Hit Girl, and the movie goes down hill form there onwards. These two characters completely overturn the central question - they are ordinary humans, but they do posses superpowers. They fight better than professional hit men, dodge bullets and cannot be knocked down or break their bones. The movie transforms into your average super-hero movie and becomes a parody of itself. Add to this your two-dimensional villain and all the clichÃ©s have been restored. What a shame.<br/><br/>To top it off, the movie is filled with unnecessary gore and bad language. Unlike in movies like Pulp Fiction or Sin City, it does not add anything to the plot of Kick-Ass. Quite the opposite, it makes the Hit Girl character even more unlikely and the fight between good and evil unrealistically obvious. It seems to me that the director could not decide what to make: an intelligent comedy, a parody or a popcorn action movie.<br/><br/>Still, Kick-Ass is not the worst movie ever. It was entertaining for the most part and did retain a touch of comedy throughout the second half. Just be sure to have your friends over and some beer in the fridge if you decide to watch it."
"griffolyon12","8","1","15","16 April 2010"," A Fun, Sure-Fire Hit!
","Few movies can actually have so much blood, carnage, and absolute political incorrectness, and actually get away with it, and Kick-Ass is one of those films. I'll get to the bottom line, while Kick-Ass is not the greatest superhero film of all-time, and is not as much of a satire of the whole genre as I would have wished, it's just such a good time at the movies, I completely forgot about anything other than just being entertained.<br/><br/>The film is a what if scenario. What if superheroes were real? In a way though, the superheroes in this film are not your average superheroes, more like vigilantes, like the Punisher and such. They kill, they don't just bring the crooks to justice, which is one thing that irks me a touch about the film, but not so much that I didn't enjoy it.<br/><br/>It's all about a gawky teen, named Dave, who decides one day to take his love for superheroes, and put it into practicality by becoming one himself. One thing that the film does, is it doesn't allow Dave (a.k.a. Kick-Ass) to become Batman or the Punisher, he remains as Peter Parker would have had he never been bitten by that spider and still tried to be a superhero. Like the great hero Spider-man, the film is identifiable to just about anyone who grew up as a comic book nerd, like myself, which is partly why the film is a joy to watch.<br/><br/>Like Spider-man, Kick-Ass has his Mary Jane in Katie, and unlike the comic, they actually allow Dave and Katie to hook up in the end, which I like a lot more to be honest. In both the comic and the film, Dave and Katie become best friends cause Katie thinks Dave is gay, the difference is, in the film when he reveals he isn't gay, Katie wants to be his girlfriend, and in the comic she calls him a perverted freak, essentially. For me, this actually gave the film an added layer of emotional connection, maybe because I am a hopeless romantic, but it made what could have been a mindless, raunchy, gore-fest, something that actually had a beating heart at its core.<br/><br/>The film is raunchy at times, actually a lot of the times, but it never seems to be as raunchy as something like Superbad or Knocked Up. It's just the right amount of humor at the right times to make you laugh, and most of these laughs are generated by the pint-sized, 11-year-old assassin Hit-Girl (played marvelously by Chloe Moretz) and her dad, Big Daddy (Nicholas Cage, who does his best to be Adam West). Hit-Girl has all of the great one-liners in the film, and her and Big Daddy are really the only two superheroes in the film anyways that actually seem to know what their doing, but their story also lends an emotional core to the final act of the film that I wont spoil by divulging, but it makes the action at the end of the film actually feel as if it was worth something.<br/><br/>I'll just say it, I enjoyed the movie more than I enjoyed the comic. The movie actually allowed itself to have more fun, and that's what I liked about it. The film reminded me so much as to why I got into comics as a kid in the first place. I didn't get into comics to have thought provoked, or nothing of that ilk. I got into comics to be entertained, emotionally charged, and taken to a different world for a short period of time, which is what Kick-Ass does exceptionally well. It is over-the-top and kind of cheesy, but it's enjoyable for the kid inside of me to watch. I mean, Hit-Girl and Kick-Ass flying over New York City in a jetpack is so cheesy, but it was my favorite sequence of the film. Or what about the badguy getting blown to bits by a bazooka!?! Ultimately, if any faults come with the film, it is that the story kind of lags in the middle sections a bit, and it also missed out on a great many opportunities to be smarter than your average comic book film and actually be a genuine satire and not just another clichÃ©' comic book film or spoof. But I can't really hold any of this against it, I had fun watching it, and while I don't think at the end of the year I'll really remember it all that much, for a night on the town, it was well worth my $8.25 ticket.<br/><br/>I give Kick-Ass an 8 out of 10!"

"TheMovieDiorama","7","0","1","18 June 2018"," Kick-Ass deconstructs the superhero genre and assembles specific components to create outlandish action.
","Matthew Vaughn found his style with this film, a style that would later become a trademark for his most successful franchise 'Kingsman'. Excessively stylised action that excel in showcasing gratuitous violence with comedic flair. All blending into a light hearted story in the name of entertainment. Yet, Kick-Ass is slightly more intelligent in its execution than the average action flick. A high schooler is tired of being invisible, so he creates a superhero alter ego in a bid to fight crime and become noticeable. Utilising a standard formula for any superhero origin story and flipping it upside down by becoming a self-referential comedy. By allowing its own awareness to seep through the plot, it suddenly becomes hilarious and that is exactly what this film needed in order to differentiate itself from the clustered genre it resides in. Then applying Vaughn's glossy use of blood and guts spewing from every direction, the film suddenly becomes intelligent and entertaining simultaneously. It's just ludicrous fun. During its deconstruction of the genre, there are times that the plot succumbs to the clichés it sets to avoid and thus becomes predictable for the most part. Fortunately, an interesting cast list keeps the narrative flowing. Moretz is the foul-mouthed ""Hit Girl"", the always eccentric Cage is ""Big Daddy"" and Johnson the optimistic protagonist ""Kick-Ass"". Cage and Strong gave the best performances with natural comedic execution to their dialogue, particularly the former who forcefully communicates like a broken robot. Johnson played the alter ego well, but unfortunately didn't really suit the nerdy character of Dave. The action, for the most part, was well edited although certain scenes felt slightly haphazard, especially the final shootout which was crazily mental. Overall, I admire the intentions of Kick-Ass. It's light, fun and entertainingly humorous. A more exciting plot would've elevated the originality, but Kick-Ass definitely kicks ass."

","I'm late to this film, but have always heard things good about it and basically knew the premise going into it. Kick-Ass didn't exceed my expectations, but it also didn't falter. It's exactlt what I thought it would be and I still enjoyed it. It used to be Spider-Man was one of the most relatable Superheroes, but he is dethroned by Kick-Ass. This depicts the realities of if someone were to really take the law into their own hands as a spandex wearing vigilante and I love that about it."

","Good fun. The ironic tropes are maybe a little overplayed, the convenience of the plot movements can be a bit cringey, and I always find there to be little emotional weight in the characters, but it is just damn good fun. A lot can be forgiven of a story that just enjoys itself - it's crazy, it's garish, it's full of holes, but it just drives on without leaving you too much time to pull it apart, and by the end you've had a good time. Great set pieces, and generally well acted. Ultimately, it's watchable - and, crucially, rewatchable - and refreshingly straightforward without being lightweight. Not bad at all."
"iamdawiz","7","0","2","22 January 2018"," A brutish satire which gives inspiration that even the most dull and pathetic are capable of superb heroism.
","Why hasn't anyone actually become a superhero yet? The answer is simple: It's bad for your health! Kick-Ass satirizes the comic book superhero genre by juxtaposing the mundane with the hyper-violent and in doing so creates an non-virtuous delight. <br/><br/>Boasting satisfying performances from a very efficient cast, with Chloë Grace Moretz (Hitgirl) being the most distinguished, captivating direction from Matthew Vaughn and a very rewarding story, Kick-Ass manages to make the near-death pummeling of an 11 year old girl entertaining. While the film faces evident shortfalls such as failing to fully realize key character development and holistic human characteristics, a father-daughter duo who goes on vengeful killing sprees with absolutely no remorse for their actions is a tad inhumane and unrealistic. The film also suffers from disoriented pacing, at times it feels a bit too carried away with itself. However, the ultra-violent action, well placed comedy and attention grabbing direction overcome these obstacles.<br/><br/>While it is entertaining, the moral repercussions that this film attracts will prove inimical to its legacy. Everything from the reckless parenting of Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) , the foolish courage of Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson), the severe pounding that Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong) unleashes on an 11 year old girl and that said girl's brutal murder streak coupled with complete remorselessness for her actions make this film immoral, corruptible and perverted to say the least.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, Kick-Ass for what it truly is, is a brutish satire which gives inspiration that even the most dull and pathetic are capable of superb heroism. What stands out to me the most from this film is that practicality values much less than theatrics."

","I wasn't expecting much but once I started watching and got hooked then I realized that this is the kind of movie which could be fun and still differentiate itself from all that superhero crowd. This is a very different kind of superhero movie because this world has superheroes only in the comics {Just like real life} but our protagonist wants to change the world and make it one where superheroes do exist. The only problem I had was with some fight scenes which were way to shaky to understand whats going on {This is not that bad of a problem} but other than that I thoroughly enjoyed watching this and totally recommend this to anyone who wants to see a different kind of superhero movie."

","Kick-Ass, a movie from 2010 but still worth to watch !<br/><br/>It's about a high school student called Dave, he has a normal life, nothing special or significant until he wants to get a super-hero.

The combination of Action and Comedy is fantastic. Especially for students this movie will be great. It's related to the every day life of a student in a funny way, full of action.

"Screen_Blitz","9","0","1","4 August 2017"," Spawning with audacious humor, gleeful profanity, and over-the-top violence, this film sets stone to a subversive turn in the superhero genre
","Kick-Ass is not a superhero film that will leave parents ecstatic of taking their children to. It is a violent, profanity-charged action spectacle that pulls no punches when exercising its hard R-rating. By many means, that is the good news. Adapting from the pages of the comic books series of the same name by Mark Millar, this subversive action flick embraces its anarchic spirit with its gleeful use of profanity and stylized violence to portray the genre in ways many forms of the media have never found the guts to do before. With English director Matthew Vaughn in the operator's chair, the movie offers a witty question and places it into action: How come no one's ever tried to be a superhero in real life? This question is put into a context in a form that is not meant to be firmly realistic, but to grip viewers in an unapologetically raunchy, yet wildly fun time. That is if you can handle the offensive edge to its brutally irreverent material. This film follows Dave Lizewski (played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson), a high school comic book geek who asks his best friends Todd (played by Evan Peters) and Marty (played by Clark Duke) ""How can no one's ever tried to be a superhero?"". While the answer becomes obvious that being a superhero in real life would be dangerous, Dave nonetheless orders a wet-suit online and decides to become a superhero. There is no problem, of course, he does not have any superpowers. After stopping a vicious mugging near a local convenience store while recorded by a bystander via cellphone, Dave becomes a viral internet sensation and adopts his superhero name ""Kick-Ass"". His fame inspires 11-year old Mindy MacCready (played by Chloe-Grace Moretz) and her father Damon (played by Nicolas Cage) who join in the life of crime-fighting as Hit-Girl and Big Daddy respectively, in attempt to seek revenge of the city's drug dealer Frank D'Amico (played by Mark Strong) who has his teen son Chris (played by Christopher Mintz-Plasse) suit up as his own superhero Red Mist to lure them in a trap.<br/><br/>Is this movie realistic? No. Is it meant to be? Absolutely not. What one of the most respectable aspects of this flick is being self- aware of itself while energetically poking fun at the superhero genre. Matthew Vaughn's ability to showcase the genre in a rebellious fashion without fear to pushing the boundaries of its mean-spirited humor is where the source of fun lies. Vaughn effectively crafts a story of a young teen who grows to extreme measures to fulfill an unrealistic dream of becoming a superhero, while spacing enough room for some stylized, effectively shot action sequences and gunplay to result in plenty of gunfire and blood splatters all for the sake to provoking both laughter and adrenaline. And the main figure in the action is the eponymous character played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson breathes plenty of charisma and humanity in the role. However, there is a bigger show stealer in the crowd, and that is Chloe Grace-Moretz in her relentlessly bold role as Hit-Girl. If you capable of handling an excess of F-bombs spewed from the mouth of an 11-year old girl who slices and kills people with a katana, you are in for a joy ride with a performance that have people talking about it for quite some time. While the role has been subject to some controversy, there is no doubt that Moretz hits the jackpot in the character. So brace yourself! Mark Strong, playing the villain Frank D'Amico, is no game changer, but makes for an interesting portrayal of a man burning with corruption. And the good news is that the cast does a magnificent job at contributing to the comedic tone of the film, as opposed to the more somber moments that come occasionally during the proceeding. <br/><br/>Kick-Ass is a subversive superhero action thrill ride that nicely opens doors to directions the genre has rarely gone before. It is funny, wild, but brutally violent and offensive to the point that will leave some sensitive viewers, particularly the conservative right, uncomfortable. Nonetheless, it makes for a wildly entertaining good time."
"EthanBJones_03","8","0","1","27 May 2017"," *Slow Clap*
","'KICK-ASS' was directed by Matthew Vaughn, stars Aaron Taylor- Johson, Chloe Grace Mortez and Chris Mintz-Plasse and is the story of a teenage boy who tries to become a fully fledged superhero. As his story unfolds, he meets new, amazing friends, make new, despicable enemies and, ironically enough, gets his 'Kick-Assed' multiple times. <br/><br/>What can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said? It's a fast paced, ultra-violent comic book movie starring a bloke in a green suit, a psychotic 14 year old and Batman. It's a fun movie, no doubt about that. It's competently shot, acted, directed and written and I guess I can recommend it. Chloe Grace Mortez steals the show as Hit Girl followed swiftly and competently by Aaron Taylor-Johnson and even Nicholas 'Not the Bees' Cage, who gives a surprisingly great performance , specially considering his recent track record. I do really adore how this movie is essentially Matthew Vaughn flipping off the 'child friendly' genre Superhero films are now seen as today. While it was made a tad bit before films such as 'Guardians of the Galaxy' and 'The Avengers', it still echoes the sentiment of how childish superhero movies have become and did a hilarious satire of the genre, over 6 years before 'Deadpool'.<br/><br/>This movie is first and foremost an origin story and it does that job exceptionally well. I know NOTHING about Kick-Ass from any comics so I can't comment on accuracy but I can say it was a great origin that rivals that of 'Iron Man' and 'Batman Begins'. There are some plot threads that aren't solved throughout the movie, none of which I'll spoil but there are a few that, while maybe not needing closure, would have been nice to get closure on.<br/><br/>Aaron Taylor-Johnson provides his best performance as the titular character 'Kick-Ass' and made the character so much more interesting that he ought to be. Despite his efforts, Taylor-Johnson was outshone by Chloe Grace Mortez' amazing performance as Hit Girl and stole every single scene she was in. Hit Girl was, easily, the best character in the movie and I could even see a movie being made about her. Nicholas 'HOW'D IT GET BURNED' Cage was surprisingly great as Batman and played his character well. The Human Bear Suit provided a cheesy, fun performance and really smashed home the films tone. While Chris Mintz-Plasse was good as Red Mist, I don't think his character was less necessary to this movie than spray tan is to Supreme Leader Trump. Mark Strong was passable as Frank D'Amico but he wasn't too strong of a villain. Lyndssey Fonseca was very weak as Katie and provides less use than to this movie than the Death Stare did to Clinton's campaign.<br/><br/>This movie was mostly well shot and edited but I didn't like some rapid sequences of quick cuts which I personally think harmed the movie more than aided it. The effects in this movie were very mediocre. That costume design, however, is more on point than the costume design of Nazi Germany in WW2. <br/><br/>The action for this movie was amazing and it was genuinely hilarious. There were jokes in this movie were I laughed more than I did on 11th August 2014(what I was watching 'Aladdin'). In all seriousness, this movie achieved a genuinely great balance between sorrowful moments and funny moments. <br/><br/>One minor gripe I have with this movie is the music. None of the music fit in with the scenes and none of it actually worked well in the movie.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this movie is funny, action packed, contains sorrowful moments and is a solid 8/10. I do recommend you see this movie if you can take the ultra violence and enjoy this humour. <br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>Would Recommend"

","As we were kids and teenagers, most of us dreamed of being a superhero and saving the world, and Dave Lizewski is no different. Dave is a typical American teenager, that once got a Superhero suit as a present and he tried to fight against crime, and he got famous overnight. Soon he realized it's not easy being a superhero and that's when he meets Hit-Girl and Big Daddy. Hit-Girl is a little bad-ass that fights against and Big Daddy is her father that gets her in the world of crime. If you watch this movie for pure enjoyment, comedy and action you are going to love it. It's some of the most enjoyable movie experiences I had in years. Hit-Girl is the absolute boss in this movie. She reminds me of Mathilda in Leon: The professional a lot. And I also loved its originality. Matthew Vaughn charmed me with this movie, I can't see anybody hating this movie. And if you do, congrats you are a special cookie. Even tho how enjoyable the movie is it does have some problems. I thought the villains fighting skills were neat, but I thought their motivations were shoe-horned and The Red Mist pretending to be this friend of Dave and how he doesn't want ""them"" to hurt him and by the end, he's fighting him. I think they could've had Big Daddy alive, I thought his death was more like ""we need some of the protagonists dead"" death."

"skyminster","8","0","1","13 October 2016"," Scott Pilgrim/Spidey-Man: IN-YOUR-FAAAAACE!
","I've always liked the good old superhero film, and some action and comedy are always very welcome. Kick-Ass has action, comedy, and superheroes (sort of), in abundance. And no, I haven't read the graphic novel, so I won't be comparing it to that.<br/><br/>Kick-Ass follows the story of your average teenage boy in the later years of high school, as he somehow manages to become an internet hit as the real-life superhero, Kick-Ass, who is somewhat lame. But that's the whole point, because Kick-Ass is real lame, with his kinda crappy costume, and Dave, the kid behind the mask, is just some geeky dingus. Dave's vacant teenage mannerisms are perfect for driving the stupid and slightly careless film along, as he embodies the ridiculous script on show. If there's one thing that's true about Kick-Ass other than the fact it's oh so American, it's in-your-face. Not crappy in-your-face either, because there is a clever comic screenplay at the heart of it, as outlandish jokes and ridiculous happenings make the film super- duper enjoyable – especially for a fifteen-year-old like yours truly. It's all given to our watering eyes in some of the most solid cinematography I've seen in a while, to boot.<br/><br/>Kick-Ass' hilarity is helped by the ludicrous action, which provides a brilliantly bloody and blain-splatty stream of goofy entertainment. Although the comedy and action are definitely the film's high points, it also has some great acting performances and some great use of timing and drama — the mixing of comedy, action and drama making it seem just like a comic book, along with comic side-notes like ""Meanwhile"" floating in the corner of the screen as it sends you threw the motions. Moreover, there is, for the most part, a very solid cast on show in Kick-Ass. Dave and his two mates is a particularly good example of the acting on display, as they seem exactly like the three comic nerds you could see, as Aaron- Taylor Johnson showcases what is by far his best performance — certainly better than that boring crap in Godzilla, at least. Mark Strong puts on the perfect British villain with Frank D'Amico, too, with his character and gang providing a brilliant load of suspense, gang villainy and drama – along with some great Italian-American goons who are stupid, but not too stupid. Finally, the teenage bond between Katie and Dave is fine, because along with being something you'd expect from a superhero film, it's also well acted, because there is a clear bond between them as characters.<br/><br/>But even so, this does make for some slightly cringe moments and average high school movie traits taking some of the screen time. Although Kick-Ass is great fun, it's not exactly perfect. With Aaron-Taylor Johnson's narration it makes it feel that much more like Spider-Man 3, and the aforementioned high school moments aren't always hilarious, per say. And though there is a great mix of drama, action, comedy and the such, it gives the film slightly mixed messages tonally. Also, do we really want Nic Cage? I mean, he's good in the action scenes, but everywhere else he's a bit monotone, which is not what you want in a crazy film like this. Also, the aforementioned bond between Dave and Katie is much, much stronger than the one between Big Daddy (ol' Nic) and Hit-Girl. Although Hit- Girl isn't the most endearing kid in the world, she provides some of the most fun action in the movie. And one last small point, it's a shame that the movie slows down a around the hour mark. I would have loved full-throttle action comedy, but that just isn't quite what happened.<br/><br/>Kick-Ass, with its immensely fun and in-your-face fisticuffs, comic script and selection of great performances, all topped off with very solid camera-work is a great superhero flick. However, it is held back a little by a few average scenes and a mixed tone, in particular, which remind you that it isn't quite perfect. But man it's great fun.<br/><br/>If you like any of the Spider-Mans, or Scott Pilgrim, you should definitely watch Kick-Ass, because it's like a mix of the two — but to the extreme!<br/><br/>https://stuffandthatreviews.wordpress.com/"

","Kick-Ass, one of my favorite all time movies. I'm an exception however, as Kick-ass, unfortunately, will never get the respect it deserves in our society. <br/><br/>As far as satire goes, and yes, it is a complete satire of the superhero genre for all the morons who didn't pick up what it was going to be about in the first five minutes, it is one of the best, if not the best, I can think of in recent history. Yes, Kick-Ass is entertaining, and in doing so a lot of people easily dismissed it as dumb, idiotic, not a good movie, simple, blah, blah, blah, blah. Kick-Ass goes a lot beyond simple entertainment, it goes on social commentary, commentary on our beloved and our over the top love for ""superheroes,"" it is a commentary on our helpless world where the people who try to help are treated like dirt, where the heroes are dumb celebrities or people who just appear on TV. Many scenes in this movie carry a lot of weight, but are missed due to people expecting action, or humor, or things that keep this movie going for the sake of the average movie goer. Shame, really, a lot is here that is certainly missed by the much smarter viewers. <br/><br/>Outside of its entertainment value and commentary, Kick-Ass has heart. It doesn't go too far down the stupid side, claiming more to a dark side when needed. And, guess what, it works. For those who haven't seen the movie, go see it. You're missing out. If people can sit down and not only enjoy the movie for being truly entertaining, but also keep their brains turned on and see what Kick-Ass is trying to say, you'll realize how much of a lost gem this movie can become. The upcoming sequel appears to have lost all of this heart and commentary, but we'll see how that goes. <br/><br/>Kick-Ass, perfect 9 out of 10. Hopefully in a future people will begin to see this movie for what is it and it'll get the appreciation it deserves and get above its current 7.8 rating."

We meet Dave (Aaron Johnson) in high school when reading too many comic books has given him the idea that he should become a superhero. He becomes ""Kick-Ass"".<br/><br/>The character of Dave gives this movie the most brilliantly funny start to any movie even close to the comic book, or action, or even comedy genre. Writing that smart and that funny is not expected in a movie like this. And by ""this"", I mean a movie where bad guys have guns, and more bad guys have more guns, and then trained assassins have even more guns.<br/><br/>The ""trained assassins"" part is where Hit-Girl (Chloe Moretz) and Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) come in. Most people like Cage in his annual action role, but this is better, his comedic delivery is a sort of self-mockery and it's perfect. Hit-Girl and young actress Moretz are what sets this film apart and will determine whether or not you'll like it. Hit-Girl kills people. That's all she knows how to do. Some reviewers, like Roger Ebert, don't think it's funny when 11 year-old girls kill people (a lot of people). I happen to agree with him, but this movie has a lot of fans that don't agree. Moretz is like a cute, young, female Jackie Chan. For fanboys who like martial arts movies that is like hitting the jackpot.<br/><br/>I don't like comic books, I don't like comic book movies, and I really don't like martial arts movies. I can like action movies if they give me solid characters to believe in. That's what ""Kick-Ass"" did and I liked it. Hit-Girl sent my head spinning but that's not necessarily a bad thing."
"aierobamwn","7","0","5","16 April 2011"," Great movie...if you have not read the comic-book
","Let me start by saying, as a ""stand-alone"" movie, this was great. It's Kill-Bill-meets-Batman-cool, with a prominent element of self-sarcasm, plus a super hero that's definitely not ""super"" at and that is what makes him even more of a hero. So yeah, it's a really fun movie to watch, it brings something fresh to the ""superhero"" genre and I could easily have given it an 8...if it weren't for the comic book.<br/><br/>See here's the thing: Kick-Ass is the story of an antihero. And in the comic book, the antihero remains an antihero until the end, that's the whole point. He does not get the girl, he does not get to use cool flying devices and he never ever really gets around to killing. That's just not the way he is wired; he is the guy next door until the end and let's face it, the guy next door would seriously freak out if he had to shoot at someone and kill them! Having Kick-Ass kill people and be cool about it is...well basically it's like having Chuck kill people and be cool about it: sure, it does make sense but it kind of ruins the character. <br/><br/>As for Hit-Girl, well I do see how some could be annoyed or offended by a little girl swearing, fighting and killing. And actually, though well...Hit Girl would not be Hit Girl without all the fighting and the killing, I do thing ""they"" kind of overdid it, particularly with the ""bad words"". I am no prude, it's just that it does not really do justice to the character. Hit-Girl is a trained warrior, because her father intended for her to be a hero. Bad language was certainly not part of the training! Occasional trash talking is one thing, saying ""fuck"" and ""motherfucker"" ALL THE TIME is another and, in this case, it's too much. Plus, we don't really get to see her and her father's story. Basically, her father decided to live as a superhero and he wanted her to live as a superhero as well, because he thought the life of a superhero would be more special and interesting than of ""a common man"". Part of what made him act this way that was his loneliness - he never had anyone tell him ""is that how you brainwash your kid?"" (as it was shown in the movie). But we never see that, nor do we see him regret his decision and reveal his lies. We also never see Hit-Girl find out the truth, which kind of deprives her of a real closure.<br/><br/>So what I guess I'm saying is this: Kick-Ass the movie is, plot-wise, a glorified version of Kick-Ass the comic book, plus it's a bit more violent. And that sort of annoyed me. Other than that, I'd say it was a good, enjoyable movie with good performances, particularly that of Cloe Moretz (Hit Girl)."

It seems to me that folks older that 25 may not like it? I am well over 40. This is an odd question I know but it is hard to watch all of the films that use such young people to portray characters with such deep well developed ideas and problems. There is nothing that shocks or upsets me but I seem to get frustrated watching 14 yr old people talk about all the sexual and money and life problems they are having and it just seems to be to unreal to watch, of course I realize that this film is a fantasy. I am not old just curious if other people have this same problem with a lot of newer movies? I do understand that the main audiences of these movies are younger folks but they have no life experiences yet. I also know that most reviews of movies on this site are from folks younger than 25. I have no problem with that it just makes one cringe when a 20 yr old person has such deep life traumas because it just does not happen that way.

Basically Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) is the New York high school that is unnoticed and a big comic book fan, and he believes that anyone can become a superhero if they put their mind to it. He spends most of his time with friends and fellow comic book fans Marty (Clark Duke) and Todd (Evan Peters), and he has a crush on the pretty Katie Deauxma (Lyndsy Fonseca) who is one of those that doesn't notice him. Then his life takes a different turn when he buys himself a superhero style suit on the internet to become masked hero Kick-Ass, and his first attempt at saving the day ends up with him getting stabbed. He recovers in hospital and Katie notices him at last, and he gains a very close friend, but she believes that he is gay, it seems this may be the only reason they stay close to each other. The next night Dave gets a second try at being superhero Kick-Ass, when he saves a man being beaten up by three thugs, and it is all recorded on a phone camera. The footage is quickly becoming the most watched video online, with Kick-Ass becoming the most famous person in New York, even getting a visit from father and daughter superheroes Big Daddy aka Damon Macready (Nicolas Cage) and Hit-Girl aka his daughter Mindy Macready (Chloë Grace Moretz). Meanwhile, the big crime of the city is powerful gangster Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong) dealing drugs, and many of his thugs are going down all over, he thinks Kick-Ass is responsible. To get the better of the superhero, Frank's son Chris D'Amico (Superbad's Christopher Mintz-Plasse) becomes fake superhero Red Mist to capture a big crime lord and becomes more popular. Of course eventually the true nature of this new ""superhero"" is revealed and Kick-Ass is captured, Big Daddy is killed when his identity is discovered, and Hit Girl gets captured. In the end, after a big guns blazing sequence with Kick-Ass saving the day, and the bad guy is blown up with a rocket launcher, Dave gets the girl and looks after Mindy as much as he can, and Chris vows to avenge the death of his Dad. Also starring Candyman's Xander Berkeley as Detective Gigante, Michael Rispoli as Big Joe, Omari Hardwick as Sergeant Marcus Williams, Dexter Fletcher as Cody, Jason Flemyng as Lobby Goon, Tamer Hassan as Matthew, Garrett M. Brown as Mr. Lizewski, Elizabeth McGovern as Mrs. Lizewski and Randall Batinkoff as Tre Fernandez. There is a good cast, Moretz swearing a lot and kicking butt, Johnson being nerdy and slow with his courageousness, and Cage in the Adam West style costume, the superhero concept makes for some good jokes, there are some controversial moments, and the fight sequences are all fun to watch, I would have to see it again to make a proper judgement on my rating, but I remember it being a fun action comedy drama. Good!"

","Amazing script. Great characters. Re-watchable vibe. Has everything a great movie should so it's sad....<br/><br/>I have to say I can't understand the point of expletives etc. but when the little girl (Hit Girl) get's in to vulgarity and keeps repeating those words I have to doc this movie two points. I just could't watch this around kids, or with people because I would never want to leave that kind of impression on any body. That is the persona of a great movie. It's sad because this just misses. <br/><br/>I know young kids will copy off of things in this movie especially if Hit Girl is saying it and that really degrades somebodies character and could make a girl feel guilty, or cause problems for parents at school. If some fine tuning would have been done Kick would have still been in your face yet respectable. But hey if this director wants to make ""Fast Food"" style movies that people will just throw in the trash that's his loss."

","If I had rated it immediately after I watched it, I would have given it a lower rating. Why is that? One big inconsistency that almost ruined the movie for me. While it makes fun and is pretty gritty and real at the beginning, when Nic Cages character (plus the girl) come into play, it gets into a complete different gear. And (almost) everything that got made fun of before, is now treated pretty seriously. That's a big risk and very thin line, the movie walks there.<br/><br/>Now of course, most people might not even care and just enjoy the ride. And that's what you should do probably too. Plus I'm happy for the director, who's previous movie didn't quite make what I expected it to make (Stardust is a really good movie, maybe a bit too complex for it's own good ... which is almost true for this one too).<br/><br/>One thing is for sure, it doesn't hold any punches (or kicks for that matter) and as many have said, this might be the role to get Mr. Cage back on track again, after a few missteps. Plus the fact, that it is so different, makes it a really genuine beast. Something like Scott Pilgrim does not jump back and forth and is more in tune throughout, in contrast to this movie ..."
"joker-4","6","0","4","17 August 2010"," KICK-ASS didn't quite live up to its name
","From a plot stand-point, the selling item that would be pitched to producers, although on this film a studio did not initially buy into the project forcing Director/Screenplay Writer Matthew Vaughn to self-finance until completion, KICK-ASS is a wonderful fantasy that deconstructs the current comicbook movie craze: what if a normal Joe donned a costume and fought crime? And for the first act, this fantasy was made real possessing fun characters, true-to-life violence and a glimmer of fantasy that movie magic can do so well.<br/><br/>Vaughn, no stranger to either movie magic or true-to-life violence, crafts a lightning-quick story around Aaron Johnson's Dave Lizewski, a comicbook fan who is tired of being kicked around (by girls, by street thugs, by his own inadequacies) and decides to kick back. As a costumed super hero, though, Dave learns that his costume alone doesn't provide him with any added immortality, and proceeds to get kicked some more.<br/><br/>Enter ""real"" super heroes Big Daddy (Nic Cage) and Hit-Girl (Chloe Grace Moretz). And exit any of the real-life experiences. Big Daddy, a cliché of a framed cop, has a surplus of weapons, money and machismo. Hit-Girl, the Robin to Big Daddy's Batman, has Trinity's moves from THE MATRIX and an arsenal stolen from James Bond. Together they – wait for it now – attack the Mob, killing stupid goombas each more spectacularly and violent than the previous one. And they befriend Kick-Ass. The film continues with Kick-Ass getting the girl and saving the day after a sacrifice of ultimate proportions is made.<br/><br/>Raise your hand if you've seen this before.<br/><br/>This current comicbook-movie trend, which is now 10-years-old if you consider Bryan Singer's X-MEN film from 2000 to be the progenitor, is nothing more than a sub-genre that feeds from a much larger branch that has been entertaining fanboys and muggles alike for decades. Westerns, war stories, cop flicks, sword-and-sorcery, science fiction and even 80s action films are all morality plays where a hero, be it John Wayne, Gene Hackman, Clint Eastwood, Arnold Schwarzenegger or Bruce Willis, stands up and occasionally takes a kick in the face before defeating that ultimate evil. Comicbook movies do just that, albeit with colorful costumes, but when done well, makes that costume believable and even non-existent as it is the character that drives the story.<br/><br/>The first act of SPIDER-MAN is widely regarded as the perfectly-outlined origin story. Love, loss and learning all play part of Peter Parker – the Character's – development. Peter becomes what drives Spider-Man. Ignoring Peter's 45+ years of development over that of Dave Lizewski's, KICK-ASS focuses on a potentially fun character and his all-too human impetus for donning a mask. However, as is evident in Dave's ongoing monologue, he questions why real-life superheroes don't exist as he tries to become one. But just as real-life superheroes don't exist, neither do real-life superhero films.<br/><br/>Vaughn's film is fun to watch but ultimately is a comicbook movie – and a generic one at that. One that ends as foul-mouthed spectacle existing in a universe where 11-year-olds such as Hit-Girl would never be a hero in a Stan Lee story."
"malignancyy","8","0","3","7 July 2010"," Great movie, recommend to anyone. No top 200 though.
","I would never have expected this movie to be so good. The comedy and action was just spot on. It was not one of those movies where they try to incorporate some comedy and it is just cheesy and diminishes the movies potential. They use comedy where proper to enhance the movie, and a lot of it. I would go as far as to say they blended it well as Shaun of the Dead. The plot of the movie was also great. The way the stories linked together was great and simple (had they tried something complex like in Crash or Traffic it would have not fit). The movie used cliché superhero and action themes and events, but it definitely put its own twist on them. Although this movie does NOT deserve to be in the top 200, it is great. I think that it is just the kind of movie that many people who review here on IMDb like. I give it a 8.0/10."
"niteshpoonia","6","0","8","14 June 2010"," Kick-Ass?! Are you kidding?
","Firstly, I must warn you people that this movie is not what you think it is. It's no comedy. It's no superhero movie. It's just a 2-hour bull. I don't know why was this movie made in the first place. It's a waste of time. Cage is wasted. The boy in tights is wasted. The chick is wasted.<br/><br/>Was it ever funny? Was it ever truly kick-ass? Was it even made for worldwide audiences? Disastrous movie. I'm being very very very generous when I rate it 6 our of a scale of 10. It'd not even score 6 on a scale or 100.<br/><br/>I think the makers were trying to make it a comedy but I guess the director grandma died and the script lost its humor.<br/><br/>The action sequences seem so funny without the intent of being anywhere close to being funny. The script is damned. Our hero suddenly thinks he's some *man of steel*. Nicholas Cage is a cheap rip-off Batman. Chloe Moretz is still thinking that it's (500) Days Of Summer. Clark Duke is somewhere between Sex Drive & its sequel.<br/><br/>Most funny of all, the actors are trying to look serious.<br/><br/>Movie gone totally wrong.<br/><br/>Believe me guys, you must not watch this movie just 'cos it's rated so highly on IMDb. No way in hell, is this movie deserving of even thinking of."

","The thing is, I have a problem when KICK-ASS scores 8.2 on IMDb and SUPERBAD scores 7.8 ...<br/><br/>The fact is that SUPERBAD is better written, better directed and better acted. Maybe KICK-ASS contains scenes that viewers here liked better. But I can't shake the feeling that KICK-ASS's high rating is a result of the all the comic-book's fans voting it high.<br/><br/>That said, I really enjoyed KICK-ASS. It's a well put-together, entertaining movie. Good enough to make me pick up the graphic novel.<br/><br/>But I think comic book movies have still got a little way to go before they catch up with movies created from the ground up by other movie makers."

Yes, movie is decent and definitely worth a watch, but it is NOT a masterpiece or ""best"" in any kind of way some may claim it is. It's fun and exciting, but on the other hand dumb in some parts and kinda forgetful to some point. So may proclaim is - go see it, but don't believe the hype too much."
"mike-adly5","7","0","4","1 June 2010"," In a Nutshell: Kick Ass
","Kick Ass...Entertaining but a little less than its name!<br/><br/>Once you see the trailer of this movie you know you're in for something special and a lot more than ordinary. Kick Ass is anything but ordinary. But beware, this is actually tailored to a certain chunk of the audience and for them it will really kick ass. For others it may be just OK and for many, trust me, it will be ridiculous.<br/><br/>Kick Ass is about Dave, a high school nerd, unsurprisingly a fan of comic books, who decides to become a superhero since no one has done it before in the real world. As the story of him becoming a vigilante goes on, he meets other real world superheroes and gets involved in a quest of brining down a drug lord and his gang.<br/><br/>As much as I enjoyed it, I have to say the ratings, which are through the roof, sort of ruined what could have been a more pleasant experience for me. It made my expectations go so high, I spent the whole movie on waiting mode, holding my breath for something magical to happen so that I can meet those expectations. America has always overrated whatever fell in what I call the rule of four: vampires, aliens, dinosaurs and blood (you thought I was gonna say superheroes, didn't you?). Kick Ass falls in the last category, with bad guys brutally murdered, burned, sliced and in one part grinded and that, for many, could be the main reason they'd watch a movie and actually laugh.<br/><br/>Actors of Kick Ass are actually a great fit despite their diversity, mainly of age, which I believe is one of the reasons for the movie's great reception. The humour is also enjoyable for the most part. And what's special about it is that it actually has a story to follow which is usually a rare factor in similar films. But on a moral level, I'm just not sure that a 10 year old girl shooting and savagely killing big guys is a great idea. It is to some extent fun to watch, but may not be for everyone.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, it is not one of the best movies ever, like listed on some websites but it is definitely funny and entertaining. It is rated R, so no kids (talk about irony). But if you are in the mood for some kids running around chasing bad guys, I say grab the pop corn and play this one on."

Kick Ass has a great story, plenty of excitement & action, and some killer comedy. I can totally see why some people would be offended by some of the content of this movie, but its all contextual and easy to shrug off with a point of view that it's all just a bit of fun.<br/><br/>On the Fruit-Meter Kick Ass gets the 'Pineapple' - A big and bold movie.

"siderite","8","0","8","12 May 2010"," Nice concept, but average after that
","I expected a silly super hero movie, although I knew from the extremely well done publicity that it was a little different from that. Good job marketing team! However, besides the idea of a geeky Jewish kid becoming a silly costumed defender of justice for no apparent reason, the rest was your average teenage hero movie.<br/><br/>That doesn't mean it didn't deliver the kick ass action, the emotional content and a little of that Peter and Mary-Jane thing, because it did. If you take Spiderman, remove his powers, make him even geekier (yes, it is possible) and then add a slightly demented Batman and his daughter in the movie as a secondary character, you get Kick Ass.<br/><br/>The ending was a little disappointing, as well. If you beat the drums about the powerless every day kid super hero, don't create a ridiculous action scene at the end that makes no sense tactically, anyway.<br/><br/>Bottom line: good for a few laughs, but don't take it seriously."

"diac228","9","0","9","16 April 2010"," Pure comic book fanboy heaven
","There has been many, many, many, many, many, many, many (clt-v is awesome) comic book movies in the past several years, with some being good, some being bad, and some being downright ugly (Hulk anyone?). However, we rarely get movies that celebrate the entire genre the way horror was celebrated by Shaun of the Dead and Slither and spaghetti westerns were celebrated by almost anything Tarantino (loose exaggeration, I know). Kick-Ass however ends this drought by becoming the bad-ass, kick-ass, slam-bang roundabout kick to the face of a movie that the fans had been hoping for. This film is not just a nice homage to all things comics; it's also a wonderful story full of action, suspense, a bit of drama, and all blending in with dark humor. If you like your comic book movies raw, smart, engaging, and downright fun, then Kick-Ass should be your cup of martini.<br/><br/>Kick-Ass is about a typical teenager named Dave (Aaron Johnson) that wants to become a superhero to help those in need, and to add a bit of purpose into his life. After accidentally being shown online trying to fight a gang, a slew of wanna-be superheroes followed suit, with some actually rising to become serious threats to villains of New York City. Based off a new-generation comic book written by Mark Millar and John Romita Jr., this film successfully takes the homages, grueling humor, and intense moments from the comic book and translates it to the screen with very little filler space. Written by the director Matthew Vaughn and Jane Goldman, Kick-Ass manages to cover a lot of ground, backstory and all, without ever dragging the movie. And unlike your usual comic book dialogue, there isn't a single line that made you want to cringe or squeal in disgust.<br/><br/>What makes this movie totally work and keep you entertained, is the likability of every character on screen. Part of this has to do with the writing, but most of it is the superb acting. Aaron Johnson shines in the lead role, by mixing vulnerability with a delightful down-to-earth personality that's easy to relate to. In terms of emotions, Kick-Ass most resembles Spider-Man, a person who accidentally receives some powers but carries a lot of emotional weight with his newfound glory.<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage and Chloe Moretz delivered the best performances by portraying a sentimental and deadly father-daughter team that provided some of the best laughs and some of the heavier moments. Moretz is incredible, especially for someone her age; she isn't your typical kid that curses only for laughs—she can kick your arse twelve times before you hit the ground. Its tough to make an audience convicted that a child can perform such maneuvers, but Kick-Ass pulls it off without breaking a single sweat.<br/><br/>Matthew Vaughn is a much underrated director, but if he doesn't get any special love for his directing here, then I give up on critics nationwide. He directs this with such glee, such precision and such talent, the entire comic book movie world should start taking notes. The pacing is incredible, the surprises are well-hidden, and the action sequences are edited so tightly, it was inches from perfection. The fights and shootouts were brutal and didn't pull any punches, as you see blood, guts, and absolute mayhem right at your face. If the action were any closer to you, you'd walk out of the theater with burn marks and eternal scars.<br/><br/>Kick-Ass succeeds as a great movie because it gleefully parodies, references, and imitates comic book movies of the past and the present. Spider-Man, Batman, Superman, and even Sin City had their small moments to shine as all of the characters going to the high school mention, read, talk about, and criticize comic book characters. This is a fanboy's movie, no question about it. Kick-Ass never tries to appeal to the mainstream, instead aims and hits the target at entertaining those in love with flipping to the next page to see the next comic panel. No PG-13 carnage here, you'll get all the blood, violence, sex, and humor that's usually in the bookstores but rarely is on-screen nowadays. You'll feel every punch, shot, and crushing blow---and you are going to love it.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Kick-Ass is kick ass. I know everyone is going to say the same thing from here on out, it's far too easy a compliment to give it. But, there's no other way to describe the 110 minutes. If you want a deeper explanation, we have a blend of good writing, good acting, good dosage of action, and good dosage of emotion, good directing, good pacing, and enough entertainment to cover the last couple comic book movie disappointments. Nicholas Cage is forgiven for Ghost Rider (not yet for Bangkok Dangerous.not yet), and fanboys yet again can flock to the theaters to see a film that was made strictly for them---much like Zombieland last year. Recommend to anyone that likes comics---new or old."
