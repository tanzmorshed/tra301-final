"MovieAddict2016","10","318","387","5 April 2004"," Essential masterpiece; powerful De Niro; simply one of the best films of all time.
","""Raging Bull"" isn't the average, stereotypical underdog boxing movie, because it isn't really about boxing at all. Like most great movies, its focus is much deeper. It came out in 1980, earned Robert De Niro a Best Actor Academy Award, and was marked down as another solid triumph by director Martin Scorsese, whose previous 1976 outing with De Niro earned them both critical acclaim (and for De Niro, an Oscar nomination, although he would actually earn an Oscar for ""Raging Bull"" four years later).<br/><br/>It dwindled in production hell for quite some time, with Scorsese's drug use halting production and only the duo's strong willpower that kept the project moving ahead. It was after De Niro read boxer Jake LaMotta's memoirs that he knew he wanted to make the film, so Scorsese and De Niro turned to Paul Schrader for a script. Schrader, who had previously written ""Taxi Driver"" (1976), agreed, and wrote the screenplay for them. The rest is history.<br/><br/>""Raging Bull"" has often been regarded as the greatest film of the 80s. To be honest, I'm not so sure about that, since various genres offer different feelings and emotions (comparing this to a comedy might seem rather silly). But to say it is one of the most powerful films of all time would be no gross overstatement -- it is superb film-making at its finest.<br/><br/>De Niro gained 60 pounds to play LaMotta, which was an all-time record at the time (later beaten by Vincent D'Onofrio, who gained 70 pounds for Stanley Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket""). His physical transformation is on-par with any great screen makeover, especially the most recent, ranging from Willem Dafoe in ""Shadow of the Vampire"" to Charlize Theron in ""Monster."" In addition, co-star Joe Pesci also lost weight for his role of Joey, LaMotta's short, eccentric brother. The greatest scene in the film is when LaMotta accuses his brother of having an affair with his wife. The tension is raw, the dialogue amazing, and the overall intensity electrifying.<br/><br/>The film is most often compared to ""Rocky,"" more than any other, apparently because they both concern a certain level of boxing. As much as I absolutely adore ""Rocky,"" ""Raging Bull"" is a deeper, more realistic film. But whereas ""Raging Bull"" is raw, ""Rocky"" is inspiring, and that is one of the reasons I do not think these two very different motion pictures deserve comparison, for the simple fact that they are entirely separate from one another. The only connecting thread is the apparently central theme of boxing, which is used as a theme in ""Rocky,"" and a backdrop in ""Raging Bull."" They're entirely different motion pictures -- one uplifting, the other somewhat depressing -- and the people who try to decide which is better need to seriously re-evaluate their reasons for doing so. They both succeed splendidly well at what they are trying to do, and that's all I have to say about their so-called connection.<br/><br/>De Niro, who could justifiably be called the greatest actor of all time, is at the top of his game here. In ""Taxi Driver"" he displayed a top-notch performance. He wasn't just playing Travis Bickle -- he was Travis Bickle. And here he is Jake LaMotta, the infamous boxer known for his abusive life style and somewhat paranoid delusions during his reign as world middleweight boxing champion, 1949 - 1951. Throughout the film, he beats his wife (played expertly and convincingly by the 19-year-old Cathy Moriarty), convinced that she is cheating on him, and that is more or less what the film is truly about. The boxing is just what he does for a living, and could be considered as a way to release some of his deeper, harbored anger.<br/><br/>LaMotta has a close relationship with Joey, his brother, and their interaction is often what elevates the film above others of its genre. The dialogue is great, close to the perfection of Quentin Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction,"" rich in that rapid-fire filthy language and brutal insults. Pesci, who was on the verge of quitting showbiz at the time of pre-production, was spotted by De Niro in a cheap B-movie named ""The Death Collector"" (1975), a.k.a. ""Family Business,"" a truly horrid film that nevertheless showcased an early sign of things to come for Pesci. De Niro wanted him for the movie and his premonition was either very lucky or very wise -- this is one of the best performances of Pesci's entire career.<br/><br/>Scorsese shot the film in muted black and white, portraying a certain era of depression and misery. To make the blood show up on screen during the occasional fight scenes, Scorsese used Hershey's Syrup -- which is an interesting tidbit of trivia for any aspiring film-making planning on filming a violent movie in black and white. But how often does that happen?<br/><br/>This is certainly one of the most intense films Scorsese has directed, and one of the most important of his career. Along with ""Taxi Driver,"" it is an iconic motion picture that will stand the test of time for years and years to come. <br/><br/>Scorsese and De Niro's partnership over the years has resulted in some of the most influential and utterly amazing motion pictures of all time: ""Mean Streets,"" ""Taxi Driver,"" ""The King of Comedy,"" ""Goodfellas"" and ""Casino"" come to mind almost instantly. But perhaps the one single title that will be remembered as their most daring effort is ""Raging Bull,"" a motion picture so utterly exhilarating that it defies description. It is simply a masterpiece for the mind and senses, leaving you knocked out cold after its brutal one-two punch. If I had to assemble a list of required viewing, this would be up there towards the top."
"head_radio","Null","104","127","28 October 2004"," Some technical aspects of this cinematic masterpiece
","The first surprising thing about Raging Bull as a film is its black and white photography, with the only colour footage being the short home video sequence of La Motta's wedding. Originally, the decision to shoot the film in black and white was based specifically on cinematographer Michael Chapman and Martin Scorsese's memories of 1940's boxing bouts, which they remembered as black and white flash photos in magazines. People's memories of Jake La Motta's fights would have been black and white ones and therefore it seemed right to shoot in black and white, even though at first they had fears this would be seen as too pretentious. The particular visual intensity of the fight scenes, however, was partly due to financial difficulties rather than directorial choices. In an attempt to keep the picture on schedule, two separate lighting styles had to be adopted. Jake's life outside the ring would be kept as simple as possible, and this meant that the scenes in the ring could be concentrated on more. They would be shot entirely in the Los Angeles studio and would be highly stylised. This is how the dazzling visual nature of the fight scenes was allowed to come about. Scorsese, suffering from a low point in his career, was convinced this film would be his last and wanted to go out with a bang. Hence he decided to give the fighting scenes all he could, since he had nothing to lose anymore.<br/><br/>What Scorsese disliked about the previous boxing films he had seen was the way the fights were shown from ringside, adopting a spectator's view, which protected the audience from the brutality inside the ring. For Raging Bull, Scorsese was determined to get as close as possible to the raw violence of the fights. He would film inside the ring and make the audience feel every punch. His plan was to shoot the fight scenes as if the viewers were the fighter, and their impressions were the fighter's, and never to insulate the audience from the violence in the ring. The viewers would think, feel, see and hear everything the boxers would. Aside from the opening fight, La Motta's first professional defeat against Jimmy Reeves, there would be no cuts to the baying of the crowd. For the Reeves fight Scorsese chose to include some chaotic backlash from the crowd showing their disapproval of the judge's decision, but apart from this scene, Scorsese's mantra throughout the film was 'Stay in the ring'. Each intricately choreographed fight would have a different style in order to reflect La Motta's different states of mind at the time of the fights. <br/><br/>Jake La Motta was consultant for the film, and the fights were depicted as he remembered them. For example, in his second fight against Sugar Ray Robinson, the ring is wide and brightened by the radiant white of the canvas making the scene feel free and open, and a relatively comfortable atmosphere. This is because La Motta won this fight, a great victory against his great rival. In contrast to this, the ring in his next fight against Robinson, which he lost on a controversial decision, was designed by Scorsese as a 'pit of hell'. In the opening shot of this fight, Scorsese has made everything look unclear and indistinguishable. This time, the ring is very dark and smoky which increases the blurred, unfocused feel of the fight. Often during this fight, faces are out of frame. For example when the two men are boxing La Motta's face is often blurred out by smoke or hidden by his opponent's body. This is seen once again when he is in his corner for the break in between the rounds; the shot has his face completely covered by one of the ropes of the ring. This was how La Motta himself remembered it; these events will remain unclear in his mind since he could not work out why he had lost. This sequence depicts a particularly upsetting part of La Motta's memories, and perfectly illustrates how he was feeling at the moment of the fight.<br/><br/>Just as important as the look of the film was the sound. As with the cinematography, two different styles were adopted to differentiate between La Motta's life in and out of the ring. The fight scenes were recorded in Dolby Stereo with heightened, often animalistic sound effects and a striking use of silence. This contrast with the dialogue in the film, which was recorded normally, was used to emphasise La Motta's heightened sense of awareness in the ring. The most memorable use of sound in the film, in particular the use of silence, is in La Motta's fourth fight against his great rival Sugar Ray Robinson. The rounds are punctuated by eery silence, giving an impression of slow motion and evoking the idea of what would be running through the boxers' heads. Just as memorable was the decision to use an animal's breathing for Robinson's final attack on La Motta. Everything is standing still, there is a striking silence throughout and all that can be heard is the bestial breathing building the suspense, as if Robinson was a lion about to strike on its prey. The next sequence is an extremely fast montage of cuts showing La Motta being badly beaten by Robinson. This scene moves between Robinson and La Motta at a rapid pace to suit the lightning fast boxing of which La Motta is on the receiving hand. This was carefully planned out and storyboarded beforehand by Scorsese and then skilfully brought to life by editor Thelma Schoonmaker, who won an Oscar for her work."
"waltergl","10","203","264","25 November 2002"," It doesn't get much better than this
","Easily one of the most powerful films I have ever seen. I have watched it at least ten times, and it only gets better and better with each viewing. Martin Scorsese is absolutely the greatest filmmaker of the last quarter century, and this film is his best. The story of how boxer Jake LaMotta watched his career and marriage crumble under the weight of his violent temper and deep-rooted misogyny is told with no punches pulled (excuse the bad pun), as Deniro (in what may be his best performance) and Scorsese unflinchingly explore what drove this man over the edge, and what ultimately may have pulled him back. The boxing scenes easily rank with the most brutal and violent moments ever put on film, shot in stark, unadorned black and white and utilizing unlikely sounds including shattering windows and animal cries to great effect. Thelma Schoonmaker's jarring, discordant editing in these scenes also deserves special mention. The scenes of domestic violence are not for the faint of heart, but there is really no other way to tell this story. If there is a more perfect exploration of why as men we act the way we do, then I'd love to see it, because this movie made me re-evaluate my life. 10/10"
"tfrizzell","Null","147","201","28 September 2000"," Scorsese's Best? De Niro's Best? The 1980s' Best? Probably on All Three
","""Raging Bull"" is a cinematic masterpiece which pulls no punches.  Based on a true story, Robert De Niro (in his second Oscar-winning role) stars as Jake La Motta, a middle-weight prize-fighter from the late-1940s and early-1950s, who basically destroys himself and those around him because of an uncontrollable temper and poor decision-making.  Instead of going down as one of the greatest boxers of all time, La Motta ruined his career because he was unable to see the ""big picture"".  He threw bouts, he got involved with low-life underworld crime figures, he beat his wife (Cathy Moriarty, in her Oscar-nominated role), he abused all those closest to him, and he had relationships with young girls who were still considered minors.  Even his strongest tie, his younger brother (Joe Pesci, in an Oscar-nominated, star-making part), gets cut during the course of his untimely self-destruction.  La Motta goes from middle-weight champ to a washed-out stand-up comic at a local club.  He gains weight uncontrollably and ultimately just becomes another face in the crowd by the end of the film. By the end, La Motta proclaims that he: ""Could have been a contender...."", quoting Marlon Brando's famous line from ""On the Waterfront"".  ""Raging Bull"" is one of those films that is masterfully crafted in all possible departments.  The screenplay is one of the best in the history of film. Martin Scorsese's direction is superb and so is the cinematography (shot almost entirely in black-and-white).  The film delivered De Niro an Oscar and also won for its editing.  ""Raging Bull"" is one of those films that is very close to ""Citizen Kane"".  They both deal with men who desperately want to be great, but ultimately destroy themselves and those around them.  This film is often rated the best film of the 1980s.  I cannot argue with that opinion.  I also think that this is the best work that Scorsese and De Niro have ever done.  The fact that this film lost the Best Picture Oscar to ""Ordinary People"" in 1980 is probably the biggest disappointment since ""Citizen Kane"" lost to ""How Green Was My Valley"" in 1941.  Excellent.  5 stars out of 5."
"bob the moo","Null","77","106","16 March 2002"," Classic examination of masculinity
","The story of boxer Jake La Motta from his rising star in the 1940's through to his own downfall and his eventual living on the cabaret circuit in the present day.<br/><br/>Scorsese and De Niro  nobody needs say any more.  Whether it be media satire (King of Comedy), small time thugs (Mean Streets) or real gangsta s**t (Goodfellas), the two rarely miss.  This was one of their best to date (and probably for ever).  The story is fascinating in itself but as an examination of masculinity it excels.  The film allows us to watch a man who goes along with all the things he thinks make him a man  even when those characteristics and habits begin to destroy everything he has  his marriage, his realtionships and his career.  Combine this with the gripping boxing tale of ups and downs and you have a film that never outstays it's welcome.<br/><br/>Scorsese is on top form  the use of black and white any have been a quality issue, but he uses it well.  The fight scenes are other worldly  exaggerated to the extent that it is breathtaking and more shocking than previous boxing scenes in other movies. My favourite effect is the sound editing in the fights where silence and calm seem to descend just before key moments..amazing.  The relationship stuff is also gripping and Scorsese handles he human cost just as well as he shows us the physical beatings.<br/><br/>De Niro is amazing  the method stuff alone is great, but his whole performance is intense.  Similarly Moriaty, Pesci and Frank Vincent are excellent  however they all stand in De Niro's shadow.<br/><br/>Overall  an excellent film on so many levels, as a story, as a examination of masculinity, as a sports film, as a lesson in direction and editing..this excels in so many ways  may it never drop out of the top ten from the twentieth century!"
"GavAnderson","10","102","146","14 February 2005"," Another Scorsese masterpiece!
","Raging Bull is one of Martin Scorsese's best films and with out a doubt the best film of the 80's. It follows the career of middleweight boxing champion Jake LaMotta as his career progresses but his emotional problems worsen.<br/><br/>The most notable feature in Raging Bull is the colour. All but the home Video footage is shot in black and white. This was a huge risk on Scorsase's part but it defiantly pays off, the film wouldn't feel the same had it been done in colour.<br/><br/>Throughout the entire film acting is simply impeccable. De Niro and Pesci are both stunning. The script is amazing, you really feel like you understand every character, none of their actions seem out of character no matter how outrageous they may be.<br/><br/>Scorsese's directing is stunning. He really is a very talented director and in Raging Bull it shows. The fight scenes are famous for their brutal realism and it's easy to see why. He puts you right in the ring with the fighters and you cant help but admire their technical brilliance. However, the most stunning aspect of all is Thelma Schoonmaker's editing. Its some of the best editing I've ever seen especially during the fight scenes where it's positively breathtaking.<br/><br/>No matter what happens you always find yourself sympathising with La Motta, even during his most outrageous moments. Not only is Raging Bull the greatest film to come out of the 80's but is one of the greatest this century that's highly underrated and defiantly worth owning.<br/><br/>10 out of 10"
"MrSharma","10","96","141","2 October 2005"," one of the most powerful movies, ever!
","From the story of a one time middle weight champion of the world and his apparent necessity for internal conflict and self destruction, America's greatest director in the history of cinema has carved a masterpiece of a feature, teaming up with the greatest actor of his generation in order to establish what will no doubt go down in history as one of the most powerful films of all time. ""Raging Bull"", directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Robert deNiro in the brilliant performance that ensured him a well deserved Academy Award, is a raw feature film that will have you stunned at its conclusion and leave you reeling in your theatre, couch or bed until the final credit has finished rolling off the screen.<br/><br/>The film, adapted from another source, revolves around the rise and fall of Jake LaMotta (deNiro), an ambitious middle weight fighter who has struggled for years along with his manager brother (an unforgettable Joe Pesci) to get a shot at the title for the middle weight champion of the world. Frustrated with himself and the life that he's had to lead, LaMotta presents the complex mind of a self destructive man who's inhumanity and self-destructive nature push him away from all the people in the world that love him and ultimately transform him from a prize fighter into an overweight sleaze with nothing but the clothes on his back. From the flawless and gripping boxing scenes to the raw yet accurate portrayal of his abusive habits towards both his brother and wife, ""Raging Bull"" succeeds on absolutely every level.<br/><br/>DeNiro's performance in the film is unquestionably his finest piece of work in his own personal career, if not throughout the history of cinema altogether. Completely believable as a boxer, he furthermore went on a diet to put on 60 pounds for his scenes situated in the latter half of the film when he has hit rock bottom which is testament to both his dedication and his unparalleled skill of establishing a believable character. Joe Pesci is absolutely brilliant as his portrayal of Jake's brother, Joey LaMotta, and considering the fact that was one of his first feature films in the spotlight, he completely delivers a character who loves his brother unquestionably but who also has internal struggles regarding his own nature and his methods of dealing with his brother. I fell in love with Joe Pesci due to his performance here, and he is clearly one of the more talented and gifted actors within Hollywood.<br/><br/>Scorsese is also in top form, and you can feel his presence, his brilliance and his uncompromising dedication to showing you the real life and times of Jake LaMotta in every single piece of footage presented to you on the screen. Martin Scorsese illustrates the reason why he is considered by many to be cinema's greatest film director of all time as he takes you on a journey of Jake LaMotta's personal and public existence. Scorsese doesn't leave anything out, and his brilliance obviously lies within the fact that he can illustrate everything about a character in the simplest of scenes to make you empathise but simultaneously make you comprehend the various fundamental layers of such a despicable character in cinema history. And on top of that, he can make you like the character and hate the character at the exact same time - a brilliance unprecedented throughout Hollywood and surely testament to Scorsese's superiority to directors such as Steven Spielberg and Clint Eastwood who, despite having tremendous talent, cannot realistically present characters to the extent that Scorsese can.<br/><br/>Further supporting cast members, Cathy Moriarty and Frank Vincent deliver completely credible characters with Moriarty well deserving of her Oscar Nomination for her performance as Vickie. The editing was completely flawless and top notch throughout the entire feature with Scorsese's other partner - Thelma Schoonmaker - bringing Scorsese's incredible vision to life once more without a single complaint in the world. Brilliant cinematography ensured a visually compelling piece of work, exemplified further by an Oscar Nod towards this element of the picture also.<br/><br/>All in all, this is arguably the finest achievement from the Scorsese-DeNiro partnership, and it delivers everything that you would predict from our beloved Martin Scorsese. Love, deceit, hate, an underlying theme of violence, some of the best acting ever put on film as well as some of the most brutal and compelling sequences of boxing you'll ever see: all are shown with flamboyance and an honest brutality that we've come to accept as the trademark of Martin Scorsese in this poignant tale of one man's annihilation of self. And who is the only director who could realistically bring this to life? We all know the answer.<br/><br/>Well done, Mr Scorsese. Regardless of what the pretentious fools responsible for the decisions that the Academy makes, the people are fully aware of who the best director in town is.<br/><br/>""Raging Bull"" is flawless and perfect. 10 out of 10, all the way."

","Jake La Motta's story is no doubt the best movie about boxing of all times together with Robert Wise's The Set-Up. Besides the legendary performance of Robert De Niro, there are many things in this film that will remain in my heart forever: the splendid black & white, the contrast between the slow moving scenes and the frenetic ones, the choice of the music and the sense of loss which entangles the whole movie. De Niro faces another ""born loser"" role (after Travis Bickle, John Rubin, Johnny Boy) and strikes again; Martin Scorsese is the most poetic director of the last 30 years."
"CinemaClown","Null","16","20","29 September 2018"," Impressive From A Filmmaking Standpoint But Lacking Flavour In Narration
","Bringing the life story of one of the roughest brawlers to ever step into the boxing ring, Raging Bull finds director Martin Scorsese & actor Robert De Niro teaming up once again to deliver yet another quality work but just like their other collaborations, it left me cold & indifferent to whatever it had in store and while I respect the legacy of this sports drama, I'm no fan of it.<br/><br/>Raging Bull chronicles the life of Jake LaMotta, a middleweight boxer whose rage, jealously & bouts of violent outbursts helps propel him to the top of the division but his inability to keep those vicious tendencies in check outside the arena leads him on a path of self-destruction, as he destroys his relationships with his wife & family over the years and wounds up all alone in his later life.<br/><br/>Directed by Martin Scorsese, the film is incredibly faithful to its source material and recreates the events with accuracy. Shot in black & white, which gives the picture a timeless quality, it illustrates the good, bad & ugly side of LaMotta with finesse and his arc is undeniably compelling. But he also comes off as an insufferable persona whose problems are of his own making which makes his downward journey all the more deserving.<br/><br/>What also affects the experience is that the story remains a monotonous ride for the entirety of its runtime. There is no escalation whatsoever whether we are witnessing LaMotta's boxing bouts or personal life. It's just a similar set of events repeated time n again for 125 minutes and that's not enough to keep the interest alive. It's brutal & violent in the ring but it fails to deliver the desired emotional impact because we are just not invested in his journey.<br/><br/>However, from a filmmaking standpoint, Raging Bull is an outstanding piece of work. The staging of events, the era-appropriate set pieces, the boxing choreography, the controlled camerawork, all of it exhibit an exactness that's quite commendable. And as for the performances, Robert De Niro leads the show from the front and delivers a smashing showcase as Jake LaMotta, and he is brilliantly supported by Joe Pesci & Cathy Moriarty who play his brother & wife respectively.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Raging Bull is impressive in its craftsmanship but the narration is lacking in flavour and becomes repetitive after a while. Scorsese's direction & De Niro's commitment to his role certainly stand out but the longer it goes on, the more wearisome it becomes. Painting a faithful portrait of a character with no redeeming characteristics, Raging Bull is significant from a filmmaking viewpoint but there isn't much to gain by investing in someone who refuses to learn from his own mistakes."

","Whoever is dissatisfied by Raging Bull, I'm sure they watched it with expectations of watching a sports movie, like Rocky. Despite the AFI chose Raging Bull as the #1 sports movie of all time, you can't expect to see the most breathtaking boxing match nor to witness the best crochet of boxing history. Raging Bull can only be classified as a drama/biography. Director Scorsese chose to go with black&white cinematography only to keep the young viewers away from this masterpiece of art. It's not fair to compare Rocky with Raging Bull. Rocky was a populist movie mostly for young viewers, and Raging Bull is a cinematic masterpiece. From a wide point of view, for instance, if you look at one of the Michelangelo's paintings; at first you see a nude woman, if you look longer and deeper you realize that her nudity expresses some thought, if you look continuously and give a life to it in your imagination you discover that the women are not just their bodies. Accordingly, like it is not enough looking once to a painting to understand what opinion does it defend; it is not reasonable and not fair to watch Raging Bull so as to see a sports movie. Also it is not reasonable to see Raging Bull only once. Raging Bull is one movie that, every time you watch it you get a better taste, every time you watch it you discover something new. <br/><br/>Raging Bull taught us that even if you are the best at some skill, even if you are the best of all; you need to create witnesses, admirers and supporters of your skill. It's the only way to reach the top. Moreover, it is harder to stay at the top than to reach the top. Not because someone better than you can defeat you, it's just because of the need to be accepted on every authority; like the Council of Judges, the Media and the Admiration of People. Director Scorsese draws benefit from the hypocrisy of fame. He empowers Raging Bull to make people ask to their conscience if the popular values that people choose can really cherish their values. <br/><br/>In Raging Bull, Jake La Motta was the best boxer of all, but people didn't like him. He was disrespectful, he was uncivilized, he was very ugly, he was arrogant, he was irritable and he didn't care; 'cause he believed himself. Despite the fact that he is the best, everybody disliked him. Soon, he was left alone; and in a very short time he lost everything he possessed. When he opened his eyes back to life, he found himself in prison. The scene that he is punching and butting the wall facing him is one of the most heart rending memorable scenes of the whole cinema history. <br/><br/>At the end, he finally throws in the towel of believing himself, he loses his faith and becomes to learn what he never wanted to learn: The Fame. He starts running his own business at a night club under his name, working as a stand-up comedian at the stage. People laugh at him for the jokes he made out of his memories, the jokes paraphrasing the bitter facts of life; including the very famous joke of the British King Richard-III which he said in the year 1485 just before dying: ""A horse, a horse... My kingdom for a horse!"". There we understand truly: For every joke there lies a share of a fact underneath."

","The routine use of black-and-white film to make movies seems to have ended in the mid-sixties, probably killed off by the advent of colour television. Since then black-and-white has been used very sparingly; even Polanski's `Chinatown', obviously conceived as homage to the films noirs of the 1940s and 1950s, was shot in colour.<br/><br/>`Raging Bull'- a biography of the boxer Jake La Motta who for a time held the world middleweight championship- is one of the few exceptions. The use of black-and-white seems to have been inspired by the fact that the film depicts real-life events that occurred in the forties and fifties. Scorsese has tried to capture the look of both the films and the newsreels of that period. This is remarkably effective for the boxing scenes, which have a raw, brutal power and graphically depict the aggressive nature of the sport. The other remarkable thing about the film is the performance of Robert de Niro, for which he won a well-deserved Best Actor Academy Award. De Niro actually learned to box for the film, and did all the boxing scenes himself without using a stunt double, but his portrayal of La Motta's private life is equally effective.<br/><br/>Some boxers- Henry Cooper comes to mind- are hard-hitting inside the ring but gentlemanly and restrained outside. La Motta, as portrayed in this film, did not fall into this category. De Niro portrays him as a man with a very short fuse, seething with anger and violence. Unlike his great rival Sugar Ray Robinson, an elegant practitioner of the art of boxing, La Motta tries to overpower his rivals with brute force rather than relying on skill. His aggression is not something confined to the ring, but rather an inherent part of his personality, and comes out in his dealings with others. He treats his beautiful wife Vicki particularly badly, frequently (and irrationally) suspecting her of infidelity and subjecting her to both verbal and physical abuse. Besides De Niro's dominating performance, there are also very good contributions from Cathy Moriarty as Vicki and from Joe Pesci as La Motta's loyal brother Joey, another frequent target of abuse despite his loyalty.<br/><br/>For me, this is a very good film, yet one that falls just short of the classic status that some have claimed for it. At times it is enthralling to watch, but at others, particularly in the first half, it seems to lack structure, as La Motta takes on a series of opponents without the significance of these fights ever becoming clear. More could have been made of the gambling-inspired corruption that infested the sport at this period and which may well have contributed to La Motta's sense of frustration- at one time it is made clear to him that his getting a chance to fight for the world title depends upon his taking a dive in a non-title fight. The main weakness, however, is a sense of emptiness at its centre, resulting from the lack of a character who can engage our sympathies. As I said, it is De Niro's performance that dominates the film, but for all his fine acting, even he cannot make us sympathise with a drunken, self-pitying, paranoid, violent wife-beater. As a character study of an unpleasant character it is excellent, but it can go no further than that. I cannot agree that this is the greatest film of the eighties; indeed, for me it was not even the greatest sporting film of the eighties. (I preferred both `Chariots of Fire' and `Eight Men Out'). It is an easy film to admire, but a difficult one to love. 7/10."

""Raging Bull"" is the story of former boxing middleweight champion Jake La Motta, and his penchant for self-destruction. La Motta is not in the least a nice guy. He is well, a jerk, who eventually drives any and everyone who has ever cared about him out of his life. He evolved from a lean, trim boxer to an overweight loser who owns a night club.<br/><br/>This film currently ranks on AFI's 100 Greatest Movies at #24, and for very good reason. It contains arguably THE GREATEST acting performance in the history of cinema, by arguably the greatest actor in the history of cinema, directed by arguably the greatest director in the history of cinema. But together, nothing needs to be argued, they are the greatest tag team in the history of cinema. Robert De Niro is flawless, superb, excellent, amazing, any positive adjective is warranted by his performance. There is a reason why they call him the greatest actor. This is it. (also ""Taxi Driver"") Naturally, Scorsese's direction is flawless, and Thelma Schoonmaker's editing will pretty much speak for itself. The black-and-white(or tinted monochrome) was an ingenious touch, similar to William Friedkin's gunshot at the very end of ""The French Connection"". It is the most beautiful movie I have ever seen, if it were a woman I could only beg to drink its bathwater. Joe Pesci is excellent as Jake's brother Joey, as is Cathy Moriarty as Jake's long suffering wife. It is sad when you realize that De Niro will never act that great again, but you find solace in the fact that he once did. He is maybe my favorite actor, Scorsese maybe my favorite director, and I only hope to have a millionth of the impact they've had on film. Far superior to ""Rocky"", even though Rocky is very good and contains maybe the most inspirational theme song ever.<br/><br/>This film was criminally robbed of 1980's Best Picture and Best Director Academy Awards, by ""Ordinary People"", another one of those dysfunctional family drama's. The Academy has since lost a huge amount of credibility, but I find solace in the fact that they honored De Niro with an award for Best Actor, in a performance that warrants two of them and makes me want to shine his shoes.<br/><br/>The film gets nothing less than a 10. It was voted the film of the 1980's decade. I agree wholeheartedly.<br/><br/>Scorsese and De Niro forever."
"blanche-2","5","44","70","25 June 2006"," Scorcese robbed
","Well, I don't think I've ever been more disappointed in my entire life, but there it is.<br/><br/>I realize that this film lost to ""Ordinary People,"" a film I love. I am not an idiot - I know that Martin Scorcese is a great, very gifted artist who puts powerful images on the screen. I agree that he has been cheated out of the Academy Award many times, which makes one realize they don't count for much. <br/><br/>For DeNiro, this stands as one of the greatest performances of all time. DeNiro is one of a handful of American actors who has earned his place at the top - he's there with Brando, Pacino, and Newman. ""Raging Bull"" helped put him there. As far as the rest of the acting, Cathy Moriarity epitomizes the '40s blond and a Bronx woman, and Joe Pesci is perfect as LaMotta's brother.<br/><br/>Scorcese presents here the turbulent life of Jake Lamotta with all its brutality, sparing us nothing in his fights, his anger against his wives, his brother, no one. His obsessive nature, his jealousy, his - well, hey, his rage - does not make him a likable character. LaMotta himself was disturbed by how he came off on screen, but then had the honesty to admit that he was a bastard.<br/><br/>Scorcese creates the Bronx and the bloody horror of the fight ring in a way no one else ever has. The first shot of the lone boxer in the ring is stunning, as is the real LaMotta's own practicing of a speech in a dressing room. Everything about this film evinces the aura of a special era, especially the color home movies - a brilliant touch.<br/><br/>The only problem I had with the film was that it was boring and unwatchable. I finally got so sick of all the screaming and yelling and watching this unlikeable, obnoxious character that I turned the set off. I thought if he tortured his wife one more time asking her if she slept with his brother, I was going to put my fist through the set.<br/><br/>This is the age-old question - you know something is great art but it doesn't speak to you. You like something that's very well done but a little less artistic better - does this means you are one of the masses for whom mediocrity has become your idea of what's good? I don't know. I like to think I can appreciate a beautifully made film. But I think what I can appreciate more than that are complicated characters I understand on some level - or want to understand, real emotions, real heartache - probably more than magnificent film-making. When there is both, it's magic. For me, ""Raging Bull"" was not one of those times. ""Godfather I,"" ""Godfather II,"" yes. <br/><br/>I really hate writing these comments."
"mnpollio","4","66","112","29 December 2006"," Ostentatiously pretentious with a one-dimensional central character
","Certainly a contender for the most overrated film ever made. I like some of Martin Scorsese's work, but I have never understood the near hysterical reactions elicited by critics and his die-hard fans over his contributions to cinema which, much like Steven Spielberg, range from wonderful to embarrassing. To them, every Scorsese film is ""brilliant."" However, despite the reassurances of various critical associations and hero-worshipping fans all too willing to declare this the greatest film made in the last 30 years, most viewers may well wonder what all of the hoopla is about. The film is a biography of boxer Jake LaMotta and documents his volatile, tempestuous nature both in the boxing ring and in his personal life. There is no doubt that Robert DeNiro hurls himself heart and soul into this role, but much of the accolades heaped onto his work center on the arduous physical labors he endured to get himself into fighting shape for LaMotta at his prime and then make himself fat to depict LaMotta having gone to seed. One must admire his dedication, but it was hardly the first time an actor had gone to such efforts  people quickly forget the weight gains of actresses such as Elizabeth Taylor for Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf or Lynn Redgrave in Georgy Girl more than a decade prior to DeNiro in Raging Bull. Ironically, other than the physical, there is nothing to recommend LaMotta as a character around whom a movie should be centered. He greets every obstacle in his life, either person or event, by trying to batter it into bloody submission. There is no range to him and he is most certainly not a charismatic person. I certainly would not wish to spend more than a few moments in his presence much less the duration of this film, which ultimately depicts LaMotta as little more than a not especially intelligent, violent pugilist. The profane dialog is anything but memorable and the people who surround LaMotta are little more than ciphers. The film is brutal and often hard to watch, more so because of its pretense rather than brutality. Scorsese films the whole thing in stark black and white and choreographs some of the boxing footage with mournful classical music. All of these touches seem to indicate a serious subject of near biblical importance  but that subject most definitely is not seen on screen in the guise of LaMotta. Joe Pesci pretty much contributes his stock Joe Pesci performance as Jake's brother. The film's biggest attempt at humor comes at the expense of Cathy Moriarty, a whiskey-voiced actress who resembles a 30-year-old vamp but who the film initially tries to pass off as a virginal 15-year-old(!). To her credit, she gets past that initial hurdle and makes Vickie LaMotta the only sympathetic character in the film. Raging Bull is by no stretch a bad film, but it is a criminally overrated one done in by ostentatious pretentiousness and an unsympathetic central character who (no matter how amazing the actor's physical transformation) is nothing more than a one-dimensional thug."

The only positives I have are that it's well shot and does an excellent job portraying what it's like to be in the same room as a group of people with nothing good to say about each other. The acting is solid all around but nothing groundbreaking. Joe Pesci played Joe Pesci. I didn't find Robert Deniro's performance that amazing; yes he gained 60 pounds to play the retired LaMotta, but besides a lot of yelling, nothing about this universally lauded performance stood out to me. Speaking of yelling, about 70% of the movie is comprised of angry people yelling at each other. I guess all the characters are supposed to be unhappy, but that doesn't mean they all have to be unlikable. There's no reason to care about any of the characters since we hardly get to know them. Maybe the fact that a more relatable side of the characters is never displayed is part of what the film is going for thematically, but the presentation could have been a lot better. For these reasons, I found Raging Bull mostly boring and somewhat exhausting to sit through. I've at least liked every other Martin Scorsese film I've seen, but this one left me unsatisfied and with a sour taste in my mouth."

But I had never gotten around to even seeing a movie by Scorsese, although I'd heard great things about him.  You can imagine how excited I was to see that Raging Bull was number 2 on the Sight and Sound director's poll, and ranked the best movie of the 80s.  I was gung ho.  I was hoping to add Scorsese to my list of favorites.  But then, I actually saw Raging Bull.  I cannot for the life of me understand the glowing praise about this movie.  Is it a bad movie?  No.  It's just nothing special.  Scorsese's technique is, if anything, showy.  De Niro and Pesci are wonderful actors, there's no denying that.  But the movie as a whole just isn't particularly good.  I can find nothing about this movie that would bring it even close to the accolades it has been given.  Believe me, I wanted to like this movie.  I thought it would be great and then some; equal to the Searchers or 2001, from the praise it got; but it was uninteresting.

The way the boxing scenes, cinematography and all else was done with simple tricks that make for a great flick. Citizen Kane was perhaps the first movie to use genius camera tricks and filming techniques. Movies with genius filming tricks are equivalent to, or sometimes surpass, heavily computer-generated masterpieces like the new Planet of the Apes movies. It shows that less can be more. It can also symbolize a part in the movie and give a scene deep-meaning. That is why I agree with this being the best movie Martin Scorsese ever directed.<br/><br/>Raging Bull tells the story of middleweight boxing legend, Jake LaMotta's rise and fall. He is explosive temper is fuelled by his personal demons of frustration, jealousy, fear and paranoia of his professional and personal lives leads him to the top of the boxing world and destroys his personal life, where he eventually loses everybody that supported him. De Niro was so fantastic and was very deserving of his Oscar. Everybody in the supporting cast was excellent too. This is not a movie about boxing. That is why some people may not like this. If you think of it as a movie about boxing, you will not understand the message or meaning that this movie is trying to convey. Even if you don't think of it as a boxing movie, it may take a few watches to understand the depth. The main theme, which is probably the most important and the movie's main message, is how bad it is when violence consumes one's life: he responds with any kind of situation even remotely negative with the only way he knows how--the monster he becomes in the ring. If you can't figure out the message, you will not think this movie is totally amazing. Once figured out, you will love the movie that much more. Like Citizen Kane or It's a Wonderful Life, the main message is one that is always relevant and comes with a strong impact.<br/><br/>4/4"

And this, my friends, is way to little - we all know that, don't we?<br/><br/>I wish the scriptwriters had had anything to tell. Sometimes there are stories which are worth telling with no hidden agenda, or moral, or any of this stuff. This story isn't one of them. This is the biography of a moron who had no life.

RAGING BULL is very much an art house movie brought to mainstream cinema by Scorsese . Look at the scenes inside the ring . I doubt if a boxer would recognise these scenes as being realistic as such since everything about them are highly stylised . It's not a film that shows the gritty realism of being inside a boxing ring where two modern day gladiators fight one another , it's a film that paints the pain , poetry and ugly beauty of boxing . On a technical front this is absolutely superlative where editing , cinematography , make up and sound mix all come together <br/><br/>"" Hey Theo , if it's such a great movie why have you only given this eight out of ten ? "" <br/><br/>True it's a great movie and you didn't need me to point that out and when I say it's a very honest movie this is not meant as a criticism , in fact I do wish more movies would be far more honest when it comes to biopics , it's just that the problem with RAGING BULL can be summed up with the scene that starts with Jake and his brother banging on the TV set wondering why they can't get a picture . It's a scene that's wonderfully structured and built upon by the screenwriters , it's absolutely brilliantly acted by all the cast and superbly directed by Scorsese. It's just that it culminates with some extreme domestic violence and finishes with a haunting , nay heartbreaking scene of two children standing there as members of their family are brutally assaulted by La Motta . Don't be confused by what I'm saying , I don't want want biopics to be revisionist sycophants charters , it's just that for a movie to work perfectly the main protagonist must achieve some sort of empathetic connection with the audience and this is where RAGING BULL fails somewhat"

","I suppose I am in the minority, but I do not believe ""Raging Bull"" is a great movie, or even a particularly good movie.the photography is fine and the acting is very good, but I could find no reason why anyone would make a film about Jake La Mottas' life.There is no question, that Mr. La Motta was a fine boxer, but other than that there is nothing especially noteworthy about him. In fact, Mr. La Motta seems to have been a violent, abusive man.During the film, Mr. La Motta, beats on opponents in the boxing ring, beats on his wife, beats on strangers, beats on his own brother, and beats on cement walls.Jake La Motta isn't the only violent member of the family. Jakes brother Joey(Joe Pesci) commits an extremely brutal assault against a stranger just for talking with his brothers wife. Its fine to make biographical films about less than noble people, but there should be an underlying lesson.All I learned from ""Raging Bull"" is that Mr. La Motta was a violent, abusive jerk."

I couldn't really connect with his character, because whenever he got a chance to talk, he screamed at everyone. Boxing didn't seem to be a big part of his life either, there were never any scenes where he was struggling with his career, or boxing was affecting his life in any way. You might as well make a movie documentary on joey buttafuco. This movie wasn't any good in my opinion. And when I hoped that he would come to his senses, he doesn't.

","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>I'll be right up front. I admit Scorsese's skill but just don't like his films and certainly don't see any art in them.<br/><br/>That's because I disagree with him on what cinematic storytelling is all about. For him, characters are everything, which is why he needs sledgehammers as actors, and spikes (gangsters, etc) as the roles. Then he arranges for them to explode or simmer or steam, or explode again.<br/><br/>Every element of the eye is subservient to the character. He (always he except for his experiment with poor Alice) pulls the camera around. We as bound audience follow. It is all about involuntary submission to manufactured charisma. I don't like this style of storytelling. It ignores the greatest power of the camera's eye: to allow the audience to move in and out of spaces: personal spaces, narrative spaces, time folding, sometimes God, sometimes his victim. There's freedom and imagination when the eye is freed, and this is the real power of the filmmaker.<br/><br/>But with Martin, he ignores this power: the camera is bound. We are the weak sidekick, forced into respect. All the competence (here the editing is superb) is turned to an end which ruins the experience. Scorsese knows this, in fact at this point in his life he was feeling it, and that is why we get what we do. A camera that forces respect.<br/><br/>But alone of his films (I am re-seeing them all), this has a sweet pleasure. In the midst of the obligatory scene where DeNiro takes to himself in the mirror, we get a wonderful reference to Brando. This frames the film and explicitly acknowledges that most films (except those of the real geniuses) are about other films, not life. `Bull' stands on `Waterfront's' structure.<br/><br/>And DeNiro stands on Brando's shoulders. How brave to mouth the lines. Brando was intense, but that was not his innovation, it was an ability to project two performances simultaneously. Here DeNiro tries to equal or best that by playing three characters: himself besting Brando, his character equalling Brando's, and Brando wrestling with his character (which we see in `Waterfront' as a man wrestling with his inner self).<br/><br/>Watch how DeNiro tries. How he pushes too hard (something we can now call the Pacino/Cage error), how he loses control and knows it. Scorsese knows it too, and it speaks highly of them both to put DeNiro's `not world class' broken actor as representative of the broken `not world class' boxer. I appreciate that honesty. It makes this my favorite film of his (Scorsese)."

There are some classic scenes in here... but the movie as a whole just doesn't sustain itself for over 2 hours. Robert DeNiro portrays real-life boxer Jake LaMotta and apparently gained something like 60 pounds to portray him in his declining years. Sure, he plays the character and his foibles for all they're worth... but the movie doesn't really give us any reason to care about the man. He constantly mistreats the people close to him... his brother, his wife, his girlfriend... after a while it just seems to be the same thing over and over.

Unfortunately the film is too heavy on the negative side, no balance is shown to Jake's character, so the believability and ultimately the interest in the film disappears.<br/><br/>

Yes, I absolutely loved it but it's one of those films that makes you think (long after the credits have rolled) and when you think about it you understand it better and appreciate it more.<br/><br/>The screenplay is tight, concise and balanced. There's been some very skillfully wonderful editing. Nothing is loud or over the top or irrelevant to the main plot. Cinematography deserves mention as the camera movements are fantastic and very effective. Lighting and sound effect deserve mention too (as its a black and white movie and must have been one of the hardest tasks to achieve, while the sound is very well balanced).<br/><br/>'Raging Bull' tells the story of the infamous Jake La Motta (played excellently by the one and only Robert de Niro). Its classification as a boxing movie is totally erroneous because the film is just too much more for it to be labelled as such. And by giving such a label one would be ignoring it's brilliance. Yes, boxing is a part of Jake's life (it's what he does for a living) and that's how it's portrayed. It hardly had any significant resemblance to other Boxing movies like Rocky etc. The film is more about his relationship with his brother and wife, his ups and down in his professional life ie, his rise and fall to and from fame.<br/><br/>'Raging Bull' belongs to Robert de Niro but Joe Pesci (as the brother and manager) and Cathy Moriarty (as the wife) are equally effective in their smaller roles. The relationship between the brothers was very moving and one can't help but feel bad for La Motta when he tries to reach out to his brother in one of the final scenes. Moriarty gives a very subtle performance of the tolerant wife.<br/><br/>Even though we see La Motta as this mean hateful jerk, we see his vulnerable side and feel sympathy. Maybe that's also why his wife Vickie stood by him through all these years. It's also interesting to see that he wasn't physically abusive to his previous wife but towards Vickie he was quite violent. His brother too tries to protect him and his family (although he has his share of flaws) but in the end when La Motta's paranoia takes over things go from sour to very bad. We just see how human these characters are and at times we hate them, we like them and we feel sorry for them.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese deserves special mention for putting this beautiful piece of work on the glass canvas. He obviously has a very compelling way to tell the story. It is without any doubt one of his finest works and it has stood the test of time (one of the greatest achievements for a director I suppose)."

","Spoilers<br/><br/>Watching Raging Bull nearly a quarter of a century after De Niro won his Oscar cannot be the same experience as watching the movie when it was freshly made. The interesting thing is that regardless of when you watch a movie, there would often be another one that it would make you recall. In my case, it's Sylvia which I saw very recently. The link is the emotion called jealousy. Manifested in two real-life characters of the opposite sex, jealousy just jump out of the screen at you in both movies, although strangely, it isn't the main subject matter of either. Strange it may seems, jealousy serving as an immediate link between two human beings that could not have been more different: Jake La Motta and Sylvia Plath,.<br/><br/>
In the opening credit, against the background music of Ave Maria (Bach-Gounod's version, I think, but could well be wrong), we see in slow motion a blurred figure (presumably De Niro) in a hood, at a distance, practising by himself on the far left side of the screen, in a boxing ring. Regardless of what it is saying, or not saying, the combination of the mystic visual image and serene music produces an uncanningly haunting effect.<br/><br/>Moving right alongon the boxing scenes. Someone once said that boxing is the purest form of head-to-head confrontation/combat. The movie industry is prolific with good boxing scenes. (Even Elvis Presley in Kid Galahad is not that bad). The unique thing about the boxing scenes in Raging Bull (and there are so many of them) is that they are closest to documentary footage than what you'll see anywhere else. In Raging Bull, there is little dramatic consequence to them. As are result, they can be filmed in the purest form. Many have commented that these boxing sequences are brilliant, and maybe that's why.<br/><br/>Going to other aspects of the film, I enjoy particularly watching the courtship sequence. The parties involved are not exactly intellectual giants, and both De Niro and Cathy Moriarty portrayed there characters beautifully and, as far as I can surmise, realistically. Coming with the slightly minimalised acting is a sweet innocent that is uncharacteristic of the film.<br/><br/>On De Niro's Oscar calibre performance enough has been said over the last quarter-century, including how he went off for two months to put on that extra 50 pounds before they resumed shooting to complete the last part of the film. Looking at Charlize Theron today, we see that something never changes: the winning combination of talent and professional dedication."
"phattdirty","10","14","25","26 September 2004"," Difficult to watch but an absolute masterpiece
","Contains possible spoilers.<br/><br/>First of all I should qualify this comment by saying that I am a massive fan of Scorsese - pre-Cape Fear anyway. This is definitely his masterpiece (although Goodfellas gives it a run for its money) and the finest of his collaborations with Robert De Niro. The fact that its shot in black and white works very well because it gives it an authentic feeling - sometimes its easy to forget that this film was made in 1980 and not 1940. Robert De Niro gives his all in arguably his best performance. The scene where his punches the cell wall and bangs his head against it is incredibly difficult to watch and possibly the best single piece of acting I have ever seen on film. He IS Jake La Motta for the 2 hours of this movie. The way he gets inside the psyche and mindset of a brutal cold hearted beast like La Motta is admirable to say the least and absolutely mindblowing to be honest. Yes this film can be hard to watch simply because La Motta is such an unlikeable guy and his self destructive personality is difficult to warm to. The domestic violence he inflicts on his wife is particularly hard to swallow but it's this violent and abhorrent behaviour which makes the character so compelling whilst so unlikeable.<br/><br/>The cinematography of the fight scenes is simply amazing. On the DVD it explains that Scorsese put a fire underneath the camera lens to get the hazy appearance of some of the shots - genius. The scene which sticks in my mind most vividly is where Sugar Ray Robinson is destroying La Motta and his face explodes in a burst of blood and broken noses. The shot of La Motta's blood flying into the faces of the boxing judges is pretty gruesome, as is the shot of his blood dripping from the ropes after he loses the fight.<br/><br/>What makes this film so powerful is the fact that is based - quite accurately - on Jake 'The Bronx Bull' La Motta's real life. He appears on some of the special features of the DVD. Now a frail, cracked faced old man, he cracks jokes and comes over as quite a charmer. But having seen his antics portrayed so convincingly by De Niro in the movie, it still isn't easy to like him.<br/><br/>This really is a magnificent film. Superb acting from the ever brilliant De Niro and good support from Joe Pesci and Cathy Moriati complement Scorsese's stunning direction. One of my top 3 films of all time along with Amelie and Shawshank Redemption. Do not miss."
"JaredF80","7","17","32","18 February 2005"," Perhaps the Only One in the U.S. to put down this film
","I may be alone on this but Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull does not deserve the praise it has garnered recently, best illustrated by its lauded praise for the recently released commemorative double DVD box set. <br/><br/>I hate to be the one to attack Scorsese who just directed the best film in a long, long time, in The Aviator and it pains me to write this scathing review. It is only I have not seen any critic criticize the film's plot holes, jarring dialogue or disparate scenes that do not gel into a coherent portrait.<br/><br/>The film is too redundant, and at times silly, as we watch De Niro's LaMotta transform into a heavy-set monster. It is mainly silly in LaMotta's cell late in the film, in which DeNiro (clearly given the green light by Scorsese to improvise) basically talks in gibberish as a way to pity LaMotta.<br/><br/>Take also for instance the strange editing from DeNiro in the ring against Sugar Ray Robinson, which is juxtaposed by making love to Cathy Moriarity's Vikki. I do not get the montage when DeNiro pours ice water on his genitals with shots in the ring. It is very confusing and also, unintentionally funny. <br/><br/>It is an authentic film for sure, taking much from 1950s boxing films, most notably Bogart's last film, The Harder They Fall. <br/><br/>I have not come across one critic who has put down this film, often cited as the ""best film of the decade,"" and a ""masterpiece."" Scorsese has directed a lot of films befit for those descriptions, Casino and The Aviator stand out for me.<br/><br/>Yet, Raging Bull hardly is a masterpiece, and yet hardly anyone agrees with me. Maybe someone will maybe in another twenty five years."
"movieguy1021","7","22","44","23 March 2004"," Raging Bull: 7/10
","Is there anything worse than the overrated classic? I think not, and one movie that falls into that category is Raging Bull. Almost universally praised by both audiences and critics alike, it's one of those true ""classics"". But is it really? To me, it's just another ""good movie"": one that if it were released today, I wouldn't feel as bad giving it this review that's lower than most others. Alas, I'll get tons of backlash for this review.<br/><br/>Jake La Motta (Robert De Niro, in a weight-gaining role only outshadowed by Vincent D'Onofrio in Full Metal Jacket) is a boxer at the top of his game. He's the middleweight world champion, he recently got married to a beautiful woman (Cathy Moriarty). However, he's not very stable emotionally, and throughout the course of his life, starts to break down. Joe Pesci pops in and out randomly as Jake's manager/brother Joey. But in this movie, he's not funny like a clown.<br/><br/>I found Raging Bull to be a very interesting movie. It's a biopic about someone I hadn't even heard of before I heard of this movie. It successfully shows the whole life of someone, not just portions of it, like others do. It gets down deep into the characters, especially Jake, and shows what affects each of the three main characters and why they do what they do. Most movies could learn from this one.<br/><br/>However, I didn't really ""feel"" anything while watching it. Jake was an interesting chracter, but I didn't feel along with him. When various events occured, I wasn't affected in the way I should have been. I think Martin Scorsese really made a superficial film here. He makes an impressive film to look at, especially in the black and white, and the acting of everyone is great, but underneath the surface, there's nothing really there. But I hope I haven't dissuaded you from seeing Raging Bull. It is a very good movie, and one that you can't go through life without seeing.<br/><br/>My rating: 7/10<br/><br/>Rated R for violence and language."
"bkoganbing","10","9","15","6 April 2006"," Brutal and Honest
","Since John Wayne and John Ford stopped making films, the greatest director/actor combination of the last 35 years is in my mind Martin Scorsese and Robert DeNiro. <br/><br/>In Raging Bull these two guys are within their element. An added dimension to Scorsese's direction and DeNiro's portrayal is that these are the people they know and grew up with. Raging Bull invokes a world of the past that isn't always pleasant, but is brutal and honest.<br/><br/>Jake LaMotta as middleweight champion of the world 1949-1951 may have had the hardest chin in boxing. He was a good puncher, but he had a marvelous ability to not only take a punch, but roll with it so it did less damage than thought. He fooled many an opponent like that and set them up for the kill.<br/><br/>Large parts of the boxing establishment was controlled by organized crime back in his days, the fathers of the people you'd later see DeNiro play in Goodfellas. You had to play ball with them or you went nowhere in the fight game. Jake compromised himself by agreeing to throw a fight to someone named Billy Fox in order to get a title shot at the middleweight crown. It seared his very soul in doing that.<br/><br/>One thing that wasn't covered in Raging Bull was the drama behind the title fight itself with Marcel Cerdan the man who LaMotta took the crown from. Cerdan was a national French hero, resistance fighter, lover of Edith Piaf and possessor of a murderous punch who had never been knocked out and only had sustained three losses in his career, two by disqualification. He was quite a brawler himself. <br/><br/>Cerdan broke his elbow in the first round and for 10 rounds literally held LaMotta off with one hand. When he failed to answer the bell for the 11th round, LaMotta got the title on a TKO. He was immediately promised a rematch and was on his way to the USA for that rematch when he was killed in a plane crash in the Azores. His death set off a national period of mourning in France.<br/><br/>LaMotta later admitted throwing the Fox fight to Congressional investigators and that with the win over the injured Cerdan cast a pall on his career and reputation. Sad because it was something he couldn't help. Jake the Bronx Bull certainly did have reason to rage. <br/><br/>DeNiro is something special. Watching this film you really think you are peeking into a heavenly newsreel highlights and lowlights of the life and career of Jake LaMotta. This film should be seen back to back with Somebody Up There Likes Me, the Rocky Graziano story that Paul Newman brought to the screen. Covers roughly the same era with the same quality. <br/><br/>Joe Pesci as DeNiro's manager/brother and Frank Vincent as the neighborhood wise guy would work together again and well with DeNiro and Scorsese. Cathy Moriarty gets her first notice as Jake's second wife Vicky who became a celebrity in her own right after Jake's boxing career was over.<br/><br/>Raging Bull is one of the finest boxing films ever done by a master director assembling a perfect cast to tell the tale of a bygone era."
"lastliberal","9","6","9","14 April 2007"," Fighting demons, not boxers
","I don't know what took me so long to see this movie, but I jumped at the chance last night. I know it was nominated for a slew of awards, but that is not why I tuned in.<br/><br/>It was Joe Pesci's fourth film and he really shows the tough guy that he was to later develop in movies like Goodfellas and casino. His performance in trying to control his out of control brother was amazing.<br/><br/>Now, of course, Robert De Niro as Jake LaMotta was also impressive. To see someone with so little self esteem that he was beset by constant doubt is sad. he was an amazing fighter, but never happy as he dealt with his demons.<br/><br/>Antone wanting to see outstanding acting directing technical work in a great story needs to see this film. It is one of the best of all time."
"ccthemovieman-1","7","16","31","2 December 2005"," Abravise Characters But It Draws Me Back
","Here's a gritty, film noir-type story of real-life former boxing champion Jake LaMotta, a film that has features some memorable aspects to it.<br/><br/>Perhaps most memorable is the physical transformation of lead actor Robert De Niro, who gained somewhere around 50 pounds to play LaMotta at the end of this film. I hope he enjoyed all the food and drink it must have taken to put on that weight!<br/><br/>The story moves well with few, if any, lulls and each fight scene is fairly credible although a little too brief. I'd like to have seen more boxing but it's better than having to sit through the overdone action as we saw in the ""Rocky"" pictures. The black-and-white photography is excellent in here. I wish more modern-day films were done in black-and-white.<br/><br/>Usually the Hollywood actresses are a lot better looking than the real-life people they portray but that's not the case here with LaMotta's wife, Vicki. Cathy Moriarity doesn't hold a candle to the real ""Vicki,"" who was a knockout, a voluptuous woman feature several times in Playboy magazine. Also, early on in the film Moriarity is supposed to be 15 years old but she looks closer to 35!<br/><br/>Typical of a Martin Scorcese film, too, is the excessive profanity, which certainly dominates this film. Perhaps LaMotta was this crude in real life but between De Niro and his brother, played by Joe Pesci, it's a very foul-mouthed, loud and abrasive family. If you can stand that constant profane assault on your ears, it's still a very watchable movie until the last 20 minutes where LaMotta is pictured as a pathetic clown, getting tossed in jail, resorting to stupid jokes and just uncomfortably sloppy behavior that is not fun to watch. <br/><br/>Despite all the unpleasant parts of this story, I found this to be one of those films that kept getting better with multiple viewings. Hard to figure, but, Scorcese must have done a few things very well for me to keep coming back. The photography alone, is one thing that keeps drawing me back."
"andrewroy-04316","8","2","2","17 February 2020"," A great character study and filmmaking knockout
","Raging Bull is a great representation of the intense, character-driven dramas of De Niro and Scorsese. We see Lamotta's dreams and aggression in the ring, but also his ultimate failure to balance that aggression in day to day life. It masquerades as a more traditional sports movie, and deserves to be praised in those scenes, as the matches were extremely well edited. The real angle of the movie is revealed more gradually: it's really a film about jealousy and fear of sexual inadequacy, and how that self-doubt manifests into lashing out at others, particularly his wife. Moriarty is fantastic as a confident, poised young woman who grows to love and then fear her unstable husband. De Niro and Pesci are both fantastic, and their brotherly relationship is completely convincing. The ending is tragic, as it is painful but fitting to see him in the Florida jail asking why. It doesn't feel groundbreaking now, but that's because of the vast influence it had in the intensity of sports dramas and the classic rise and fall biopic story."
"rowanmaillot","10","2","2","16 February 2020"," Not only the best boxing movie...
","This is my second favourite movie ever made so let's just get right into it. Raging Bull is directed by the absolute master (that is) Martin Scorsese and stars (personally) my favourite actor, Robert De Niro, his film career is so diverse and brilliant, his role as, Jake LaMotta (former heavyweight champion) just adds a completely clean essence to the film. Based on a true story about 40's to 50's champ Jake LaMotta, a story of a middleweight champion who wants to be up there with the highest boxers but say he can't because he had ""girly hands"" (as he refers to them as). He wants to become a heavyweight champion and then we get Joe Pesci's performance which is absolutely iconic, however in this movie, Joe isn't the short-tempered one, Bob is. Constantly thinking that his wife is thinking of another man in bed while they're making out and thinks that there is something going on between her and his brother (spoiler alert, there is no chemistry). The score composed by Pietro Mascagni is absolutely iconic, it is something dreams are made of, the cinematography is absolutely damn amazing and I couldn't expect anything more perfect or flawless from a movie. Grade: A+"
"dandyc-73537","9","2","2","8 February 2020"," A Masculine Messy, Bloody, Mirror
","Initially, this film did not resonate. I wasn't sure what Lamotta was supposed to mean to me. He was hard to relate to. Yet something I live by when it comes to just about anything is that you should always try something twice. So I did.<br/><br/>Raging Bull is one of my favorite American films after several viewings because it truly portrays unbridled masculinity. It's not pretty. It's not morally justifiable. It's just animalistic. The constant drive to wanna be the best, to conquer the competition, to dominate women, all of these things are ugly, but American and masculine. We see a man that never rises, but continues to slowly fall. The fact that he is a good fighter, and that he wins the belt, means nothing because he gets really fat and loses his brothers love. His body and dominance start to leave him as he achieves. The trade-offs and high stakes resonate in waves.<br/><br/>One of the most stunning sequences in cinema history for me is when we see Lamotta at arguably his lowest, in prison. The scene evokes true emotion, as we see a man who has never broken, finally break. He realizes what he is. Who he is. And I cry every time. Not because I love Jake Lamotta, but because I understand what it is like to regret something that is in your nature. You're sorry, but you're not. But you are because you were caught.<br/><br/>Lamotta cannot understand why people start to turn on him, despite his treatment of them. This is personified in the final scene with Joey. His ego never leaves. The constant need for attention and justification becomes Jake's fight. He can't physically dominate people anymore, so he has to use his fragile ego to manipulate people into laughter at his self deprecation.<br/><br/>And so what does it all mean? Is raging bull a technically excellent film? Of course. Is it well directed. Sure. But what it truly is is a mirror. A mirror that men hold up, and see themselves in, like it or not. I certainly did. And that's entertainment."

He looked so different at the beginning of the movie. His transformation though tout the movie was amazing to me. Towards the end of the movie Robert De Niro lookes like Robert De Niro. Joe pesci also did a good acting as Jake La Motta''s brother.<br/><br/>I was not interested in how Jake did as a boxer. I was more interested in the relationship between him and his wife and women. Maybe I was not that interested in Jake's boxing because I am not a boxing fan.<br/><br/>When I watched major league I was happy that the Indians won the pennant.

","I know, I know. 4 Stars?! I must be on something, right?<br/><br/>This is one of the most highly regarded films of one of the most highly regarded directors starring one of the most highly regarded actors in American Cinematic History. Yet, I just find myself unable to take it from the level of a film ""I Really Like (4 Stars)"" to a film ""I Love (5 Stars)""<br/><br/>Before I get into what it is I don't really care for in the film, allow me to rave for a few about all of the things that are great in ""Raging Bull"" just to assure you all that I am not slamming the film but do actually enjoy it.<br/><br/>First off, De Niro is phenomenal. I personally think this is his best performance though I am not personally well acquainted with his entire body of work and wouldn't argue with anyone that put up ""Taxi Driver"" or ""King of Comedy"" as a counterpoint to my statement. La Motta (Robert De Niro, ""Taxi Driver"") is a complex character who does many terrible things to the women he loves, his brother, and especially, those around him who get on his bad side. I imagine this is a tough balancing act for Scorsese and De Niro to work out together. This guy has to be volatile enough that it doesn't seem out of character for him to act in a reprehensible way but he also has to believable as a man that a young girl could fall head over heels for and also that the audience can get on board with as the anti-hero of a film that is about the tragedy of this brute's life.<br/><br/>The next thing that I really loved about this film was the cinematography. A lot has been written about the way that this film broke with common film conventions to get into the ring with the fighters but I would argue that the film does far more than that. The contrast between the more stable, slow paced, out of the ring portions of the film with the fast paced quick cut pounding of the match is key to one of the central motifs of the film: the ring is the heart of Jake La Motta. Outside the ring, he's all show. Inside the ring is where his life is to be found. When he feels the need to punish himself, he takes a beating in the ring. When he feels small and needs to feel big, he pounds the snot out of his opponent. His ultimate worth, in his own eyes, is found in his fighting, which is why it is so defeating to him when he finally leaves the ring behind for good. It's like he lost his heart or reason for living, especially since he has cost himself many of the relationships that people find meaning in once the world passes them by.<br/><br/>The theme of this bastion of unhealthy masculinity and what his ways both gain and cost him is the real star of the show. As I watch, I find myself hoping that, despite the feeling I have that he will ultimately self-destruct and cost himself everything, he might find a way to back down from a fight for once, be forgiving to his wife, or not think the worst of his brother and manager, Joey (Joe Pesci, ""Casino"").<br/><br/>So what is it about this movie that gives me pause. I'm not quite sure. It might be that you can see the end coming from the beginning and it removes a big portion of the tension for me. Maybe, it's the fact that I don't buy the idea that Vickie La Motta (Cathy Moriarty, ""Analyze That"") is even close to 14 and that seems to remove some of the taboo nature of one of the central relationships of the film. Maybe it's the fact that it wasn't till my second time watching it that I realized that those guys that want La Motta to work with them are the Mob because it was just assumed by everyone that it would be obvious. All I know is that while I like the film a lot, I'm not even a little tempted to buy it and that can only be because something about it was just off for me.<br/><br/>Please don't let my personal weirdness deter you, though. The vast majority of cinema fans who watch this movie simply adore it and I have no doubt that, unless by some freak coincidence you have all the exact same strange hangups I do, you will find this movie a more than worthy addition to you film collection."

","Raging Bull is basically an R-rated version of Rocky, and I'd say it is just as spectacular as Rocky in terms of story, acting, pacing, and the boxing scenes.<br/><br/>It is about Jake Lamotta (Robert De Niro) who is a brutal boxer that works very hard to win a championship belt. He later on falls in love with a woman, Vickie (Cathy Moriaty), and lives a good life until things get grumpy with their relationship and Jake's life goes into a downhill disaster.<br/><br/>Raging Bull is excellent. De Niro really stole the show here, and he was capable at pulling off the acting near the end where (SPOILER) his character gained weight. Joe Pesci is also in this as Jake's brother, and he did a pretty good and was able to deliver a pretty humorous performance.<br/><br/>The story I felt was great and Martin Scorsese did a great job at directing. You could easily tell he was inspired by Rocky to do this and wanted to make it even more dramatic and so forth. I also like how the film is in black & white because it's trying to be realistic with its time.<br/><br/>All in all, Raging Bull is a very great boxing film that holds up 4 decades later."

","I often struggle to connect with Scorsese's work on an emotional level. I find his films curiously intellectualized and given his interest in watching men destroy themselves I just don't get a lot from them. This fine film is an exception. Some of it is the genre-boxing film-is one of my favorite genres and Scorsese's direction is classical and restrained (most of the time) that makes the film feel like a traditional Hollywood film. The black and white really helps with this; swearing aside this feels like a 40's film. Indeed, re-watching it the other day it struck me as a more realistic version of a Requiem for a Heavyweight; it has the same somber fatalism to the proceedings.<br/><br/>Now it does have the Scorsese flourishes and the boxing scenes themselves are quite brutal. But overall I think this is my favorite film by Scorsese because of its classic influences. It is Scorsese at his least inventive but also his best."

The film can be considered a magnificent work of psychological study, where the main quality is found in the character and the perspective we have of him. Although it has a somewhat slow progress, with scenes that feel longer than they should be, probably because it is a biographical film, this does not present a direct objective, a goal or motivation, which makes the structure of the film feel slightly like a documentary.<br/><br/>Raging Bull is a strong Drama, which is introduced to us with very interesting personalities that let us analyze them with a great passion.

Cuts to a noisy TV screens when things are getting a bit repetitive saves the dry feeling I got from Rocky occasionally during fights, it also puts us in a helpless position, reminding us of how little we can really do in a situation like this, we just have to go with the flow, which also puts us in the position of Jake LaMotta whilst making us feel like spectators.<br/><br/>The acting is above brilliant. the way Robert DeNiro speak just feels so brilliantly authentic, it's so genuine, nothing is exaggerated.

","Raging Bull is a film that works on nearly every level. Martin Scorsese's direction perfectly captures the time period of the film as well as the emotional and physical intensity of Jake LaMotta's story. The screenplay by Paul Schrader and Mardik Martin is gritty but honest and beautiful. These elements combined with the phenomenal (and believable) performances of Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and the rest of the amazing cast make Raging Bull a must-see. This could have been a by-the-numbers, generic sports movie, but Scorsese and the writers instead crafted a complex portrait of a deeply troubled man. At certain points in the film, LaMotta seems despicable and completely unlikeable but at other points is sweet and charming. He is portrayed as a real human being and not just a caricature. The boxing matches are brutal and intense, but the more intimate scenes are emotionally draining as well. This is largely due to Scorsese's stylistic choices, such as the edgy black and white color palate and the home video-style transition sequences. Everything in this film is intentional and aids the story; no time is waisted. By analyzing Jake LaMotta throughout not only his boxing career but later on in his life as well, Raging Bull becomes a fascinating, intelligent, and emotional character study more than it is a straight up boxing movie. It takes a while to get into and drags in a few places. Also, some of the supporting performances are spotty and some characters are underdeveloped. However, these are minor complaints for a great film."

","This classic gives me the shivers every time I see it. I just feel mentally exhausted and broken afterwards. In a good way though! However impressive it might be, I dont often watch ""Raging Bull"", because it is such a sad story about the doomed downfall of boxer Jake La Motta. Based on a true story, which makes it even more sad, because we viewers are shown a brilliant boxing talent fall slowly down the drain. The reason why he is doomed is portrayed with such brilliant excellence that ""Raging Bull"" is without a doubt one of the best pictures ever made by director Martin Scorsese.<br/><br/>Praise, lots of praise has to be directed towards the terrific black and white photography by Michael Chapman. I dare say, that never before or after, there has been such a mindblowing registration of a boxing match. Michael Chapman made the mold. This photographer went on to film many other classics with his brilliant talent.<br/><br/>If one ever wants to experience what method acting truly is, then one should only have to watch Robert de Niro's performance. The man IS a raging bull. His selfdestructive anger makes him a shortlived star and a longtime looser. So sad to see. But acted with such brilliance that I write this review with goosebumps brought on by this marvellous classic. A must watch, for any Robert de Niro fan. A must watch for anyone who wants to see why a man can become his own worst enemy..."
"ryanwmullally","10","2","2","16 August 2018"," This Film Must Not Be Ignored
","Raging Bull is probably Martin Scorsese's second greatest film. It's very emotional and powerful. Sometimes it was a little hard to watch. It's like a nostalgic throwback to the 1940s that only Scorsese can truly tackle, and Robert De Niro gives the performance of his career that won him an Oscar. <br/><br/>It's based on the real life story of boxer Jake LaMontte from his golden age to his downfall. He was a very famous but also struggling boxer, that struggles to have support from his love ones from the way he treats them outside the ring. Jake LaMontte and his family have many tantrums throughout the movie, and really makes me wonder what it must've been like living with him. After attacking his own brother played by Joe Pesci, he gets his teeth punched inside the ring. He quits boxing, and through more powerful emotional scenes we truly see a broken down man he's become as he tries his hardest to redeem himself. <br/><br/>I think the violence that was in the ring was a metaphor for the violence at home, since he beats up his loved ones at home.<br/><br/>It's truly an inspiring movie that sadly didn't win Best Picture. <br/><br/>One of Scorsese's greatest pictures if not one of the greatest pictures ever made."

","Success is what all aspire but success is not momentary win in an event or a game. This is the process of making a good family, strong relationships and friends. This is a film centered on the story of a popular boxer who wins at the Championships but loses on his relationships due to his self-destructive attitude and skepticism. This is more of lack of synchrony between the personal and professional life.
The screenplay, the acting and the direction are worth noting. This is not a win or lose situation rather a series of events and misgivings that make or destroy our life. This draws a line between ambition and life. 
What makes a man popular?
Could not get the crux of the movie in 1st half but it catched up and clarified its theme in the second half. Well done on multiple fronts."
"Pjtaylor-96-138044","7","2","2","13 May 2018"," A different kind of 'boxing movie'; sombre yet vivid and ferocious.
","'Raging Bull (1980)' differs from most 'boxing movies' in a few ways, most of all how it charts a career instead of the build-up to a single, make-or-break bout and places its emphasis on the tumultuous home-life of the man wearing the gloves as opposed to his time in the ring. Indeed, the boxing sequences - which are vivid, vicious and ferociously energetic - make for less than ten minutes of this picture's screen-time. Though much of its focus is on the jealous, controlling and generally abusive side of Jake La Motta, the eponymous raging bull, the flick doesn't actually delve all that deep into his character, even though it does a good job of portraying him for who he was - or who the filmmakers saw him to be, at least. In this way, we get a character study done from afar, almost like we're a fly on the wall and given the backstage access our protagonist was so keen to keep journalists from getting. We aren't told anything about the stone-faced protagonist but rather shown it and allowed to make up our own minds, which is a common thread through Scorsese's work. The piece is sometimes slow, but never boring, and usually entertaining. It is also quite sombre, in the end. It is wonderfully constructed and well-conceived, easily becoming one of the best in its sub-genre, and its boxing sequences (refreshingly shot from inside the ring) are some of the best in cinema. 7/10"
"caseyt-48511","9","2","2","5 April 2018"," One of the best?
","The American Film Institute ranked Raging Bull as the 4th greatest movie of all time. Is it? It is a great film for sure. Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci are both fantastic in it and the black and white cinematography is pure perfection. Martin Scorsese is one of America's greatest filmmakers but he's made better movies. I feel that Goodfellas and Taxi Driver are superior to this movie, as good as it is. The film contains some difficult to watch scenes and isn't for everyone. It's a movie that should be viewed at least once by film maniacs. A great movie for sure, but not Scorsese's best."
"shinkim-61939","10","2","2","24 March 2018"," one of the finest films by Martin Scorsese
","Raging Bull is a movie directed by the great Martin Scorsese and stars Robert De Niro as Jake LaMotta, a boxer who eventually rises to the top but his life outside of boxing is... well destroyed because his jealousy and anger is affecting the people around him. To start things off Robert De Niro does a superb job and was amazing in the film, Joe Pesci is fantastic in this film too and so did Cathy Moriarty. Jake LaMotta is a complex character, he has a lot of flaws and the movie does not shy away from that. He takes things the wrong way almost all of the time and he gets angry a lot because of it hence the title. Unlike Rocky this is not really a movie about inspiring someone, this movie is a look behind the curtain on a boxer who has a lot of problems. The little things like the the title in the beginning being red symbolizing rage and anger don't get enough credit. The scenes where Jake is slapping Vicky because he took something that happened the wrong way or when Joey was reaching his breaking point because he is getting sick of Jake are my favorite scenes in the movie because it shows a good look into reality and are emotional. He may have been a prizefighter in the ring but in real life he is not. The movie presents it's real fights outside the ring, the fights that break Jake down as a person and that's what I love about this movie. And when I think back at this movie I don't think about the boxing I think about everything outside of it but that's not to say the boxing in this movie is good because it sure is, boxing is just a way to release is anger and it is not really a central part of the movie. Overall it is a very well edited, raw, great movie with fantastic performances and this is a must watch for movie fans"
"Wiizardii321","10","2","2","31 March 2015"," Raging, marvelously raging, one of the best, if not...
","Raging Bull - a movie about a man with bad problems. <br/><br/>What kind of problems... Well a lot. I was disturbed when I watched this, this beautiful cinematic experience. The opening, the distance, De Niro dancing in the ring with a leopard robe, black and white, ohh.... The best cinematography, it is something very VERY beautiful. Words can't express how far my love for this movie has gone and is going. I will give it a second watch...<br/><br/>With all that said, I think you'll know just how much I like Raging Bull. So, Raging Bull is about Jake LaMotta, the most mentally complex protagonist ever. A man who is number #1 in boxing, he is in his eyes at the top of the world. While he is at the top of the world, everything he does and stands for outside the ring get's completely mauled. <br/><br/>My most interesting analysis is Jake's psychology. Does he suffer from some mental dis- order? Or is this man seriously just like this naturally? His name is so accurate, he truly is a bull. A raging one. He does so many things that I think are just crazy. His sexual jealousy, his anger, every inch of detail he looks at, what the hell is wrong with him? I hated him, and that is a good thing. This character of Jake is the most mental wise evil protagonist I have seen so far. This movie had some psychological thriller in it. And what can I say about the black and white cinematography? I loved it so much! It made the movie even darker. This movie is a masterpiece you need to watch, the best movie that has boxing in it, and just all around one of the smartest movies I have ever watched."
"sandnair87","9","2","2","26 March 2015"," An Oddly Rousing Chronicle of the 'Bronx-Bull'!
","Unequivocally unsentimental in every respect, Raging Bull offers a searing character study of boxer Jake La Motta (known as the Raging Bull). Despite being the story of a middle-weight boxer, the movie refuses to be pigeonholed as merely a 'boxing' movie. It reigns as poesy of spectacle and presents a disconcerting vision of a beastly character, who dished out savagery in the ring and also at home, yet rose in his day to be idolized to a certain extent by our pop culture.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro stars as Jake LaMotta, the Bronx-based boxer whose public bouts and private demons Raging Bull chronicles with bruising acuity, without judgment or sympathy. It delves even deeper into the psyche, exploring the destructive life in whimsical detail. Taking us through the highlight reel of LaMotta's life from the early 1940s through the mid-1960s, the film details how the Bronx bruiser boxed his way to professional stardom then lost everything to debilitating paranoia only to find his life in shambles, eventually descending into self-loathing and loneliness. It is a mesmerizing exploration of the mind of an emotionally disconnected man; as likely to crush those he loved as much as his opposition in the ring. It's impossible to resist following such a talented born loser on his inevitable trip into oblivion, though it's not fun. Watching his downfall from champion to pitiful stand-up comedian and club owner is no more enjoyable than it sounds, yet it is immensely rewarding. <br/><br/>One of the triumphs of Martin Scorsese's direction comes from how fascinating Jake remains despite his conspicuous inner rage and crippling sense of sexual insecurity. These inner struggles dovetail with La Motta's performance in the ring, and the film's artful, seemingly improvisatory construction serves to juxtapose these two worlds: the intimate, naturalistic domestic world and the smoky, expressionistic world of the boxing ring. The most obvious basis for the film's claim to greatness lies in Scorsese's devastating critique of the basic codes of masculinity and finally in Robert De Niro's performance, through which that critique is made flesh. De Niro's colossal act (astounding not in the least for his now famous weight gain) firmly holds the film together, virtually hypnotizing the viewer with intensity, pathos, and even innocence. The true power of De Niro's performance rests in his ability to crawl his way into this lug's twisted psyche and air out his personal demons for all to see. <br/><br/>It will be impossible to look away from your screens, much like a real boxing match. And for that, Raging Bull remains a profoundly treasured experience: bold and bloody, yet oddly stirring. What eventually pours out on the screen is pure cinema, and pure Scorsese!"
"ryklinker","9","2","2","18 December 2014"," A talented yet emotionally self-destructive boxer's life outside of the ring is destroying any chance that he has to be truly successful.
","Right from the start, he's fighting. Fighting in the ring, fighting with the judges, and most of all, fighting with himself. After the first match that we see him in, we see that Jake La Motta is just as much of a fighter with his gloves off as he is with them on, possibly even more so. His home life is very troublesome; with a marriage where every interaction results in an argument, and a brother/manager who only patronizes him even more, being a great boxer is not what he thought. With every winning decision, his life out from under the stadium lights becomes worse. He meets an 18-year-old girl, and her personality is, shall we say, flirtatious in a bad way. It doesn't take long for his jealousy and covetousness of his young wife soon becomes a major distraction, and as the middleweight title gets closer, so does his demise. Considered by most as one of the best sports movies of all time (alongside Field of Dreams, Rudy, Remember the Titans, and Hoosiers), Raging Bull is a great film not only about boxing, but also about a man who is a boxer. One major difference between this film and fellow boxing classic Rocky is that the movie shows more about life outside of the ropes than it does inside. With the total screen-time of actual bouts at roughly 15 minutes, the sport is simply the background to the story of La Motta. What this movie truly is about is a man who is unstable in his everyday life, and he struggles to keep himself from ruining his own career. In this film, Robert De Niro delivers one of the best performances not only of his career, but also possibly of all time. Famously gaining 60 lbs. to play the last part of this character's story, De Niro's performance as the real-life boxer La Motta brought the very intense story to the big- screen. As one of his two Oscar-winning performances, De Niro turned in everything he had, and came home with the deserved recognition. In addition to the Best Actor, Raging Bull also was nominated for Picture, Sound, Supporting Actor for Pesci, Supporting Actress for Moriarty, Director, Sound, Cinematography, and Film Editing, winning the last one. I personally thought that the sound, cinematography, and directing were definitely worthy of their Academy recognition. This film came 4 years after director Martin Scorsese's successful film Taxi Driver, which also featured De Niro. Like Taxi Driver, this film also incorporates the social ineptness of a man, and how this difficulty has an effect on the people around him. At some point between after 1976, Martin Scorsese had become severely addicted to cocaine, and an excessive dosage one day left him in a hospital room. While visiting his great friend, Robert De Niro brought up the idea of making a film based on a book that he had recently read about an old boxer. Though at first hesitant, Scorsese delved into the story of La Motta, and he made this classic as a result. Now I must remind you, this is a rated R movie, and it is deservedly so. As one may expect, the boxing sequences are pretty brutal, with blood and pain visibly flowing throughout. Outside of the ring, both Jake and Joey La Motta engage in many heated arguments, and the language within these scenes is R-worthy in itself. Though nothing is shown, Jake's wife Vicki is very ""friendly"" with people, and we hear about it in pretty specific detail. With these warnings listed, I still fully promote this film. This is truly a classic film, and if you are able to endure the violence and language, Raging Bull is a must-see for anyone interested in cinematic history. This is definitely a film that requires one's attention. It is not a movie that necessarily keeps the viewer on the edge of his/her seat, and it is more about the story. The pacing is slow at times, and it can lull for a small amount of time. I definitely loved this film, and I wholly recommend this film.<br/><br/>www.sportsandcelluloid.blogspot.com"

","Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>""Raging Bull"" (1980) is a very good picture, great one (like you haven't heard about it yet). It contains superb performances by all involved, and especially by the great Robert De Nido in a lifetime performance. It's gritty, ugly, true and very intense picture, with a great director in his best form - every scene in this picture pulse on tension. Boxing scenes are very disturbing, they are short, and very brutal - although this picture is filmed in black and white, it's look stunning. <br/><br/>Overall, a true gem, called by many the best picture of the 80's. I don't think it's that good, and there are many pictures that i would call equally great, but this one is not to be mist my a true movie lovers."

So give me a... stage, Where this bull here can rage, And though I could fight, I'd much rather recite... that's entertainment."" <br/><br/>One of the most famous soliloquies, and definitely one of the more memorable in Cinema. ""Raging Bull"" is a sports film like no other. No rise to the challenge, no bull training montages just pure brutal honesty. Where would I even begin to review a movie so commended?<br/><br/>Short answer, Robert De Niro's performance is stunning. A man so dedicated to his craft, he trained extensively under the managing of the real Jake LaMotta. LaMotta claimed De Niro could have gone pro, then Robert began a gruelling month eating fine French cuisine to gain the 60 pounds needed to portray Jake's later years. Regardless if he won the Oscar or not (Which he did), ""Raging Bull"" will always stand as a testament to De Niro's passion as a performer. Finally, Cathy Moriarty as Jake's long suffering wife and Joe Pesci's mainstream debut are wonderful. The duo that is Pesci & De Niro are so good on screen line after line, insult over better insult. How can you go wrong when your own brother asks you to ""F**king lay me out"". Many themes are covered, brutal scenes of violence are depicted and even greater emotions come from some of cinema's most raw characters ever screened.<br/><br/>All thanks to Martin Scorsese, who De Niro had managed to help him get off a cocaine addiction and pursue the project. His films are always pushing the very edge of movie ratings but regardless of what anyone says, to censor any artists work could possibly hinder almost every chance of the mediums growth. Scorsese's camera work and mannerisms continue to hold up even today, further solidifying my belief as the West's 2nd best director (Number 1 goes to Kubrick).<br/><br/>Final Verdict: The best movie to ever be made about boxing that isn't a documentary. 10/10."
"adamscastlevania2","9","2","2","7 September 2014"," DeNiro doesn't come much better than this
","(89%) You can tell that this is a Scorsese film through the sheer number of aggravated physical brawls (and not forgetting the no less aggressive verbal fights) which break out every 10 minutes or so, and that's not including any of actual boxing matches themselves. And that's this film's finest accomplishment in that Jake LaMotta isn't a nice guy (which is putting it lightly), and yet seeing him fail is no less painful or easy to witness. Predominantly this is a brilliantly well made with the black and white cinematography being more than just a gimmick as it fits into the stark tale, DeNiro I don't think has ever been better, and the use of score is some of the best in any movie. Overall a must watch."
"CMTiago","10","2","2","23 August 2014"," De Niro & Scorsese in their peak
","Raging Bull is quite simply one of the best works that cinema has offered and part of that is attributed to a genial directing job by Martin Scorsese and a brilliant performance by Robert De Niro (My 2nd favorite of all time). This movie is about the downward spiral of boxer Jake La Motta, who due to his jealousy and temper issues alienates all those close to him. With the objective of becoming the middleweight champion, Jake is angry, stubborn and always finds a reason to start arguing. Robert De Niro gives his career best performance that earned him his second Oscar. La Motta is a despicable human being that mistreats his wife and nearly murders his brother. However with De Niro's own mark, one can see that this man isn't all bad. He manages to conquer his girl by being sweet and caring, while also sharing a deep connection with his brother Joey, at least until his dark side wins over. Speaking of Joey, Joe Pesci also delivers a poignant performance of Joey La Motta, who always tries to bring his brother to reason, until he can no longer help Jake. Complementing this movie's emotional strenght we see spectacular cinematography work and great boxing sequences that are as gripping as you can get. I have yet to see a better Scorsese movie. This is the one that always leaves me baffled and De Niro gives the 2nd best performance I have ever seen, only surpassed by Daniel Day Lewis in There Will Be Blood. Raging Bull is a timeless classic and a movie that exemplifies the best of Martin Scorsese & Robert De Niro.<br/><br/>Rating: 10/10"
"JakFrost14","Null","2","2","3 August 2014"," Jake La Motta's toughest fights were with his demons outside of the ring.
","Raging Bull is about middle weight boxer Jake LaMotta, played by Robert De Niro, and his life inside and outside of the boxing ring. As Jake rises through the ranks in the early 1940s, we see that his confidence in the ring is quite the reverse outside. He struggles with insecurity and jealousy which fills him with rage and guilt, and trusts no one but himself. This serves as the central theme throughout the film. Similar to what Russell Crowes' character John Nash experiences in A Beautiful Mind; the uncontrollable jealousy and insecurity are diseases almost as powerful as schizophrenia.<br/><br/>For a while he is able to control his jealous rage by taking out his aggressions on his opponents, even prolonging one fight so he could do more damage to the face of a boxer that his wife Vickie, played by Cathy Moriarty, mentioned was good looking. To a lesser extent, Jake also uses the ring to pay penance, sometimes allowing an opponent to punish him in an attempt to relieve his guilt. The use of slow-motion, silence, and increasing sound and speed give us a firsthand look at what Jake is experiencing during these fight scenes; the rage and lack of control, and the feeling of defeat and despair.<br/><br/>Desperately wanting a title, Jake is convinced by his brother Joey, played by Joe Pesci, that the only way to get the title fight is to through a fight so the mob can make money from him; then they will set up the title fight. After agreeing and throwing the fight, Jake, already distraught by his decision, is suspended by the boxing commission. Thus begins his steady downward spiral. He begins gaining weight and does nothing to keep himself in shape. No longer able to release his pent up anger in the ring, he begins beating his wife and accusing her of sleeping with multiple people, including his own brother. When she can no longer take his aggressive behavior, she screams back that she has been with everyone he has mentioned and more. He loses complete control and attacks her and his brother.<br/><br/>As Jake's relationship with his brother comes to an end, he retires from boxing to spend more time with his family. This has not done much to mend relations with his wife, we see that it appears to be nothing more than wishful thinking as he orders his family around so the press can take pictures of them, posing as the 'happy family'. Growing bored in retirement, Jake opens a nightclub where he spends more and more time, pursuing his next greatest love, entertaining. One morning, after Jake has spent the night at the club, he comes out to find his wife waiting for him in the parking lot. She informs him that she is leaving him and has already gotten a lawyer and everything is already in motion.<br/><br/>Jake's descent continues when he arrested for serving underage girls in his club, and for 'introducing them to other men'. While out on bail, Jake learns that if he can come up with $10,000 to bribe the judge and prosecutor, he will not have to serve time in jail. The only chance he has of raising that much money is to sell his championship belt. Unable to part with the belt, he pries the jewels out of it and attempts to sell them, but it is not enough. While in jail he has a breakdown, questioning why this has happened to him, and eventually coming to terms with it. In his scene there is a wonderful use of partial lighting showing the conflict and contrast Jake struggles with.<br/><br/>After being released from jail, Jake resumes his stand-up/philosopher act, and moves on with his life. While leaving a performance one night, he sees his brother Joey and awkwardly attempts to reconcile, but the feelings do not appear to be returned. He asks his brother several times to forgive and forget, but never apologizes; still to insecure to admit he has a problem and that he was wrong."

","Raging Bull is one of the greatest films ever made,an excellent,powerful and unforgettable Masterpiece of cinema that combines amazing direction,powerful acting,beautiful music and stunning photography. All of those elements make Raging Bull Martin Scorsese,Robert De Niro and Film making at their best.<br/><br/>Based on the book of the same name and set from the 1940s to the 1960s,Raging Bull tells the true story of Jake LaMotta(Robert De Niro),a middleweight Boxer who is successful and rising to the top in the Boxing ring and wants to become the middleweight champion of the world. While Jake is doing well in the ring his personal life and troubled relationships with his wife Vicki(Cathy Moriarty)and brother Joey(Joe Pesci)lead to Jake's rise and fall in and out of the ring.<br/><br/>Released in 1980,Raging Bull despite being a modest Box Office success and receiving eight Academy Award nominations and winning two for best actor(Robert De Niro)and Best editing(Thelma Shoonmaker)received mixed reviews from critics because the violence and language and lost the Oscars for Best Picture and Director to Robert Redford's Ordinary People which is a fine film in it's own right. But overtime Raging Bull is now seen as a masterpiece and not only one of the greatest films ever made but also the greatest film of the 1980s. Right from it's terrific opening credits and first scene,Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull is a brilliant and powerful masterpiece on so many levels from the acting,direction and everything else is one the main reasons I love cinema so much. The movie is a great combination biopic,sports drama and art film giving viewers a movie that is both beautiful and ugly as well as brutal and harsh at the same time. Raging Bull was one of the last if not the last great film that came from the New Hollywood era that lasted from the late 60s into the 1970s even though the movie was released in 1980. The Black and White photography by Michael Chapman is fantastic,visually stunning and truly adds to the film giving the movie an accurate and stylish look to the 1940s and 50s as well the scenes inside and out of the Boxing ring. Chapman also uses smoke and lighting to great effect not giving the movie an incredible atmosphere but reflecting the characters state of mind. What also makes Raging Bull an outstanding film is the editing by Scorsese veteran Thelma Schoonmaker. The editing by Schoonmaker is sensational because we get freeze frames,fast cuts which give the movie a great pace and quickness that was ahead of it's time and holds up years later. The Boxing scenes in Raging Bull are thrilling,amazing and some of the bloodiest and most graphic Boxing scenes ever caught on film and directed with terrific skill,detail with Actions and sound effects and when every punch is thrown you not only hear the punches you feel them as well and there is devastating impact with each of the fight scenes. What I also love about each of the Boxing scenes is that all of them have a different tone and style with Scorsese mixing realism and exaggeration. The violence in Raging Bull is shocking and at times horrific and will disturb viewers but the violence fits with the movie's tone and spirit. Although the movie has Boxing the movie is more about the man Jake LaMotta than his profession. The portrayal of Jake LaMotta will obviously divide viewers when they watch the film because on one hand we feel sorry for Jake and some of the things he has to endure but on the other hand viewers will dislike Jake because of his abuse to his wife and self-destructive ways bringing his brutality outside of the ring. We also see Jake brought down by his own insecurities and paranoia which makes his rise and fall much more tragic. One of the reasons Raging Bull is amazing because it's not really a Boxing but more of a character study. The ending of Raging Bull is amazing and memorable because it gives Jake LaMotta a new beginning that is optimistic and positive. Will you feel differently about Jake LaMotta at the end? The movie greatly asks viewers that question and makes viewers answer the question themselves. A terrific and unforgettable ending.<br/><br/>The cast is amazing. Robert De Niro is excellent in one of finest acting performances in film history and gives his greatest performance as Jake LaMotta,with De Niro bringing emotion,intensity and anger to his Oscar winning role role. Cathy Moriarty is terrific,beautiful and sexy and Vicki LaMotta,Jake's second wife and holds her own against De Niro and Pesci. Joe Pesci is brilliant and fiery as Joey LaMotta,Jake's younger brother and has great scenes with De Niro. Frank Vincent is wonderful as Salvy,Joey's friend. Nicolas Colasanto is outstanding as Tommy Como,a Mob Boss that wants to help Jake. Mario Gallo(Mario),Theresa Saldana(Lenore)and Lori Anne Flax(Irma)give good performances as well.<br/><br/>The direction by Martin Scorsese is brilliant,powerful and some of best directing in movie history,with Scorsese using zooms,wide,high and low angle shots,a great tracking shot,close ups and use of slow motion while doing an amazing with the Boxing scenes. Outstanding direction,Scorsese.<br/><br/>The classic music by Pietro Mascagni is beautiful,mesmerizing and memorable and fits with the images and tone of the movie. Great music.<br/><br/>In final word,if you love Martin Scorsese,Robert De Niro or movies in general,I highly suggest you see Raging Bull,an excellent,brilliant and unforgettable masterpiece of cinema that deserves to be in every movie lover's collection. Highly Recommended. 10/10."
"RossRivero99","10","2","2","13 July 2014"," Scorsese's boldest film yet
","Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull is not just a boxing movie, or a man who talks about sex as a joke, but it is the story of the life of Jake La Motta (played by Robert De Niro) who uses his anger and rage in and out of the ring. De Niro plays La Motta with brilliance but in order to play him he had to learn how to box first, both De Niro and Pesci give their career's best performances that really deserved Oscars for their wonderful work, especially Cathy Moriarty for her well played performance as La Motta's 2nd wife. Scorsese has made a masterpiece out of this film that tells us how Jake La Motta was in real life and how he would destroy his life out of the ring. The movie also deserved a lot more academy awards than it actually got, but it deserved best actor for De Niro (for which it actually won), best picture, best director, best supporting actor, best supporting actress, best sound editing, and best cinematography. On an episode of Siskel & Ebert where they both selected this film as the best movie of the 1980's I absolutely agree with them but Siskel included another true statement that said ""After you're done watching this movie you feel like you actually know that person."" and I did feel as if I knew him in real life."

","I feel that Raging Bull is underrated by the public they are clearly not getting it where as other Scorsese movies like Goodfellas and The Departed are higher rated then they should be, now don't get me wrong I think Goodfellas is one the top 100 movies ever made and The Departed is a classic but out of all the movies that are higher rated then Raging Bull only about 3 or 4 are regarded as being better, some of you may be thinking what Im saying is I prefer Raging Bull to these movies no no no that is not what Im saying because Pulp Fiction is my second favorite movie ever but it is way too high it should be around the 80 mark in the top 250. So let me start by saying the cast are all great I think the two best though are De Niro and Pesci, it is worth mentioning that De Niros performance I saw one magazine rank the 11th greatest off all time, the film is a film about boxing but I feel it is so much more then that it is really about jealousy and it shows it in a way that is way ahead of any other film that has jealousy in. The Boxing scenes are far better shot then any other film it just looks wonderful, I like Rocky but this is the champion of all boxing movies in fact even though I don't like to call it a sport movie if you do call it that it is the best sports movie ever. a lot more great things could be said about this film or you could just watch it and see how great it is yourself and watch it more then once it gets better the more you watch it. Plus go look at the sight and sounds poll so many Directors and critics put this in there top 10 favorite movies ever made. One last thing this fill got robbed at the Oscars it should have won every Oscar it was nominated for."

","""The thing ain't the ring, it's the play. So give me a... stage where this bull here can rage and though I could fight I'd much rather recite... that's entertainment.""<br/><br/>In 1976 Martin Scorsese teamed up with Robert De Niro and screenwriter Paul Schrader to deliver what in my opinion is one of his best films: Taxi Driver. That year that complex character study lost out on the Oscar to Stallone's Rocky. So what does Scorsese do next? He directs a real boxing movie with another memorable and complex character played by Robert De Niro making Rocky look like a cartoon character. Don't get me wrong, I loved Rocky, but Jake La Motta is a character that feels much more authentic. He's deeply flawed and unpleasant to be around with, but his violent temper is what made him such a successful boxer on the ring. It was actually Robert De Niro who approached Scorsese to make this film based on Jake La Motta's autobiographical book and despite hesitating to make a sports movie at first, he ended up directing what is considered by many to be the best boxing film of all time. The boxing scenes are violent and bloody, but what was most surprising for me was the way in which De Niro captured the rage and paranoia of his character off the ring. La Motta isn't a very sympathetic character and his anger and jealous outbursts led him to his ultimate downfall, but somehow there is still something redeeming about him and De Niro captured that essence perfectly in this Award winning performance. It's much more a character study than a boxing film, but Scorsese also explores Jake La Motta's bond with his brother Joey turning this into a sibling relationship study as well. Jake tries to channel his rage through boxing, but ultimately it defeats him outside of the ring destroying the relationships he has formed. Near the end there is a nice nod to Brando's On the Waterfront, which was a perfect touch by Scorsese who seems to always be in control of his craft and at the same time honoring other famous films. Raging Bull is an artistic film dealing with a difficult subject matter but it still is considered by many as the best film from the 80's. It's a near masterpiece in my opinion with another outstanding lead performance by De Niro, who was without a doubt the best actor at that time. <br/><br/>Jake La Motta (Robert De Niro) is the raging bull who during the 40's dominated every rival inside the ring. No one could take hits like he did and despite losing a couple fights he took pride in the fact that he never went down. Jake's brother, Joey (Joe Pesci) is his sparring partner and at the same time he manages his fights so they have a very close relationship. Joey has a few connections with the mob, but Jake refuses to deal with them and wants to get a chance at the title on his own. Joey also introduces him to a fifteen year old girl named Vickie (Cathy Moriarty), whom he later marries. As the years go by, Jake defeats his opponents but the title shot keeps eluding him since he refuses to work with the mob despite Joey's connection with Salvy Batts (Frank Vincent). While Jake's professional boxing career begins to take off, his personal life takes a blow when he allows his jealousy and paranoia to take over as he fears his wife is seeing other men. Despite channeling his rage in the ring, he also takes it out in his home on his wife and brother. What at first served as his inspiration for becoming a boxing champion escalated so much that it also became his downfall and ruin. Raging Bull centers on Jake's self destructive boxing journey and it is a very complex and emotional one. In the midst of it all there is still a redemptive quality to this antihero and he accepts his punishment through personal beatings in the ring.<br/><br/>I don't know if Scorsese would be around making movies today if it weren't for Raging Bull. Just like his lead character Jake, Scorsese was dealing with some personal demons of his own struggling with drug addiction. De Niro convinced him to make this film and somehow he channeled his addictions through his direction. Jake unsuccessfully channeled his rage in the ring, but Marty found redemption for both of them thanks to Raging Bull. The black and white cinematography is gorgeous and the performances were powerful. De Niro gives another physically demanding performance after his work in Taxi Driver and he once again is very impressive. Joe Pesci is also wonderful as he will later become a recurring actor in other Scorsese films. The chemistry between both actors in this film is really strong and they shine together on screen. The boxing scenes were really raw and violent. They are hard to watch at times, and an extreme close up of dripping blood from the rope in the ring really captured the violence that Scorsese was trying to transmit. Raging Bull is a fascinating film which explores the mind of a very emotionally disturbed man who we wouldn't want to be around with, but somehow Scorsese draws us into his mind and he absorbs us."

"drer_01","10","2","2","5 February 2014"," Raging Bull Review
","Raging Bull is the movie adaptation of the famous boxer Jake La Motta's memoir titled Raging Bull: My Story (1980). Starring as Jake La Motta, the Raging Bull, is Robert De Niro, with Joe Pesci as his brother Joey, Cathy Moriarty as his second wife Vickie La Motta, and Frank Vincent as Salvy, the wiseguy friend of Joey. <br/><br/>Raging Bull is a fast paced movie of which its plot is easily identifiable as a focus on the life of famous boxer Jake La Motta. This movie was set in urban New York City and chronicles the personal and boxing life of Jake La Motta from the 1940's thru 1964. The complexities of Jake La Motta's real life character served as the theme for Raging Bull. In the movie, Jake La Motta was a driven man of Italian descent with strong family values, a desire to stay away from the criminal element, an excellent boxer, and stubborn man. Jake came to learn that no matter how great of a boxer he was, his success was limited by forces other than his abilities and his boxing opponents. The same forces that limited his boxing achievements also impacted his personal life. <br/><br/>In the movie there was a clear parallel between Jake's boxing life and his personal life. Jake's brother Joey served as the link between the two parallels. Further, Joey served as the impetus of Jake's success on each of the parallels. True to the plot's focus on Jake La Motta the boxer, Jake fought Joey throughout the movie even though Joey fought to help his brother succeed both personally and professionally. Confrontation served as a motif of which was repeated throughout the movie. This was demonstrated in Jake's fight with the ever elusive opponents of paranoia and jealousy. <br/><br/>Notable, director Scorsese implemented an excellent technique that emphasized the importance of the relationship between Jake and Joey which involved Jake recounting a scene from the movie On the Waterfront between two brothers. And like Marlon Brando's character in On the Waterfront, Jake thought he could have done better. Scorsese did well with his control of lighting throughout the movie. There was never too much light in the movie even for the outdoor scenes. This was Scorsese very artfully controlling the mood of the audience. <br/><br/>Raging Bull is a title that very accurately describes Jake LaMotta's character. Special emphases being on rage which envelopes Jake's personal life and his professional life."

","Raging Bull is much more than another boxing film. Robert De Niro, starring as Jake La Motta, battles life inside and outside of the ring. His desire to be the middleweight champion and his self-destructive behavior prove to be the perfect storm. While his brother Joey, played by Joe Pesci, and wife Vickie, played by Cathy Moriarty try desperately to keep Jake La Motta on the straight and narrow, he is determined to allow his paranoia and temper ruin his life.<br/><br/>The theme of Raging Bull is much more than the story of a fighter but rather the conflicts this boxer battles in and out of the ring. While he is ultimately successful in winning the belt, he loses his wife, children, brother and even his freedom post-retirement in Miami. The same man, who beat Sugar Ray Robinson and many other top boxers, couldn't beat his internal rage. After losing everything and everyone, La Motta ends up alone, in his nightclub, mocked by his own audience.<br/><br/>La Motta's temper is revealed with his first wife when she couldn't cook his steak properly. He explodes in violence causing time with the first wife to begin to count down. Brother Joey seems to be hooked up with some gangster types, and Jake reveals his desire to remain independent. He yells at Joey telling him not to bring the mob down near the gym again. The mobsters represented by Tommy Como, played by Nicholas Colasanto, and Salvy,played by Frank Vincent try desperately to bring La Motta into their organization. <br/><br/>Joey shows his loyalty to his brother Jake, when Joey observes Tommy spending time with Jake's second wife, Vickie. Joey breaks up a Tommy Como party and beats up Salvy. While Tommy makes Salvy and Joey shake hands and make up, Jake remains an independent man. Finally, La Motta wins the middleweight championship belt. As he ages, he defends the belt successfully until his selfishness, jealousy and temper watch him give up the belt to Sugar Ray.<br/><br/>Boxing was good for La Motta who in retirement brags of his beautiful wife, three children and beautiful home in Miami. However, he isn't done yet. His battles outside the ring continue as he opens his nightclub. His drinking,smoking and otherwise poor lifestyle finds him in jail for committing statutory rape with a fourteen year old girl.<br/><br/>Director Martin Scorsese has another winner in this 1980 sports biography. Scorsese has partnered with De Niro before in award winning Goodfellows, Taxi Driver and Casino. We see other characters such as Joe Pesci and Frank Vincent add to the award winning casts. <br/><br/>Watch and feel the pain as Cinematographer Michael Chapman zooms in on the faces of the boxers as wounds are created and the bodily fluids fly across the ropes and into the crowd. Chapman does a great job of showing conflict in the ring. Then the conflict continues as La Motta slams the door at the end of the skinny, long hallway after yet another fight with his wife. <br/><br/>The fights in the ring will keep you on the edge of your seat; however it is the fights outside the ring which will keep you guessing as to the outcome of this great fighter."

THE SCORE! The right music can really light up a film and bring it to life. Robert De Niro's character of Jake La Motta and his rage intertwined with a beautiful classical symphony is put together with such ease and draws you in, and it makes you wonder. He plays the black and white off so sincerely. The lighting every time they stepped into the ring, everything really popped. The smoke that was caught in the air that appeared to be intentionally grainy. Everything. Robert De Niro giving one of the most well deserved best actor academy award winning performances ever to be witnessed on screen. And Joe Pesci, I apologize once again. I underestimated you and had a skewed vision of what you were like as an actor that was created from ""Home Alone""; you too, truly are talented. Their chemistry was great. The way that Cathy Moriarty put her lips together to make them seem so small and cute. It's not even really about boxing, it's more about Jake La Motta and what a terrible person he was and how sad his life became. This is not a movie of redemption. Beautiful. Marvelous. Classic.

","This biopic about real life boxer Jake La Motta who is portrayed by Robert De Niro. The movie directed by, you guessed it, Martin Scorsese. The movie starts out with the greatest opening credits sequence of all time, it immediately sets you up for the mood of the movie, introducing you to the atmosphere set in black and white, the music, and Jake La Motta. He may not be speaking but just by the mannerisms you get the vibe of a cold heated, violent man, and in all honesty... he is a cold hearten violent man, you see this throughout the movie in another one of the greatest movie performances of all time again from De Niro. The other major characters are Joey and Vickie La Motta. Both performances are good but Joe Pesci is amazing as Joey the brother to boxer Jake La Motta. Joey and Jake whenever they're on screen together it's very interesting to watch. The way the two actors talk is like they're actually brothers, whether they're bickering or just talking it always feels natural. The movie's script is one of it's many high points. It's very well written that flows great despite needing to cover so many years of events. The movie's soundtrack is also a high point. A great thing that this movie was able to do was the ability to convey many emotions, the tension in the ring, the depressing aspect later in La Motta's life, and a (what I find) heartwarming scene when the audience is shown home movies of Jake La Motta, his wife and kids. The movie remains interesting because your able to witness the violent depressing life of a violent depressing man. Your able to see what to most would be something minor as a big deal in his world (for example when his wife says hi to other men at a restaurant). The boxing scenes are a highlight in the movie, most people may say there unrealistic but I don't care about it's realism, the fights are visually something great, very bloody and brutal also. In the final 15 minutes of the film you see Jake's life once he's retired boxing. Robert De Niro actually gained 60 pounds for those parts of the movie. But those final 15 minutes are actually quite sad, your able to see that his relationships have all fallen apart, his wife divorced him, has custody of his kids, and his brother wants no part of him. But yet he is at peace with himself as the biblical quote at the end explains. <br/><br/>Raging Bull is definitely one of the greatest movies of all time. Boasting one of the greatest performances ever, a marvelous sense of directing, great soundtrack, great script. All of this makes this movie a 9.6 out of 10."
"jackasstrange","9","2","2","12 November 2013"," A modern classy masterpiece.
","With a flawless plot, and being arguably one of the best films from the 80s, Raging Bull tells the story of the raise to fame and the decadence of Jake La Motta, a man that is guided by his totally animal-like and impulsive personality. It's a very interesting story, i must say. The idea of making a film about Jake was brought by DeNiro himself, which tried numerous times to convince Scorsese to do the film. Scorsese, in fact, just accepted to do the film after knowing that he could relate himself with Jake.<br/><br/>In the technical aspects of filmmaking, this film is nothing less than great. The cinematography of the fights sequences are breath- taking. Super stylized and very different from the spectator's experience, we have a view of the fight into the ring, with a fast and very well- made edition in these sequences. And a curious fact: one of the film's main reason to be filmed in black and white was because that the colors of the gloves at the time would have only been with dark tones, such as oxblood and even black.<br/><br/>The acting is superb. The then relatively unknown Joe Pesci gives an extraordinary performance as Joey, the Jake's brother. DeNiro was without a doubt great, his dedication to the role leads him to a weight increase from 145 to 215 pounds (66 to 97 kg) to portray the post-boxing life of Jake. He also choreographed the fight scenes with the help of the real Jake La Motta. Not surprisingly, his job in the portrayal of Jake La Motta brought to him an Academy Award of best actor in a lead role.<br/><br/>I can proudly say that this film is without a doubt one of my favorites of the 80s. <br/><br/>So, Highly recommended. 9.4/10"

","After this film, still ongoing in doubt which film is the masterpiece by Martin Scorsese. Well, I do not know, but ""Raging Bull"" is definitely one of them.<br/><br/>The movie is not for everyone, because the story is very complex and unlike anything ever done, and a clean writing and direction that shape from start to finish! The story serves as a biography hasty, but goes deeper than that. The film tells the story of the career of the fighter Jake La Motta (Robert De Niro) and the rise of his career, and while his life. To the poor living fighter with a nagging wife being sponsored by the youngest brother; his tremendous winning streak; to his fall into depression.<br/><br/>The film follows, as I said before, like a biography but more exploits man. The rise in his life, and the consequences that it has brought to him. The steering black and white that Martin Scorsese uses is fantastic, giving those who watch the film to feel in place of Jake inside and outside the ring. Leaving it to those who attend feel the claustrophobia and fatigue that Jake faces during fights, and also during times of his family life.<br/><br/>The entire cast is terrific, Cathy Moriarty (Vickie La Motta) formidable and charming; Joe Pesci (Joey) excellent as always, Robert De Niro ..... IT'S JUST SIMPLY PERFECT, embodies her character in the greatest possible perfection delivering his best performance till today!

","""Raging Bull"" clearly ranks as one of the better films of all-time due to it's compelling story of the rise but yet human tragedy downfall at the end. At it's time when done in 1980 the cinematography was fabulous the film's black and white take was a neat and nice concept. Plus the Martin Scorsese does a fine job with the directing as his theme of character study and development into downfall is perfectly done. One could say ""Raging Bull"" is about boxing, but it's really about how boxing for one particular boxer shaped and affected his life in positive and ultimately demising ways. Being cautious to call this a sports drama, boxing does play an integral role in the movie without question. It simply goes to show the deeper human stories behind some of the world's greatest athletes and how it's not simply all about hard work and overcoming the odds. There are more themes in the world of sports than just that. It doesn't have to come down to who is going to triumph in the end. In ""Raging Bull,"" you couldn't care less if he wins or loses, you just want to see how it affects the rest of life of DeNiro. Robert DeNiro gives a tough and fired up performance as former real life and ex boxer middleweight Jake LaMotta, the film showcases Jake's life and career from the early 1940's till his washed up downfall as a low rent club owning stand up comedian in the early 1960's. The scenes are memorable not just the boxing ones but, the scenes of rage and blow ups from the LaMotta character. Joe Pesci gives a strong performance as LaMotta's brother Joey, he always gives encouragement and advice in an aggressive and upbeat manner, really one of the better supporting roles ever done by him. This movie is a great character study of rage, anger, and obsession just wanting to make your dream happen, but it proves many times that a downfall in the end happens can be sad and tragic. Overall good work from all involved especially Scorsese and DeNiro with a great supporting turn from Joe Pesci. What I liked most about the movie was the depiction of a person who did not hit the deserving note in life even though he carried enormous talent just because of the work ethics he carried. Definitely among Scorsese's best and still don't understand why it did not won an Oscar and losing to Ordinary people is beyond my imagination.<br/><br/>My Rating - 10/10"

","Raging Bull is more about a boxer's life out of the ring. Shot entirely in black and white,it is based on the turbulent career and life of the two time middleweight champion Jake La Motta.<br/><br/>The film opens in 1964 where an aging & overweight Jake LaMotta (Robert DeNiro) is rehearsing his lines for a standup comedy act. The scene then moves to two decades earlier with JakeLaMotta losing his first major match. Jake's brother & agent Joey (Joe Pesci) discusses his chances for a potential title shot with one of his mafia connections, Salvy Batts (Frank Vincent). He starts a relationship with a 15 year old Vickie (Cathy Moriarty) inspite of being married. He defeats Sugar Ray Robinson twice but is denied victory in the second bout due to judges. He finally marries Vickie, his love for her gradually becoming an obsession. Frequent fights erupt, most of which end in Vickie being abused physically. In one of his bouts, which he wins against Tony Janiro he brutally smashes the latter's face because he knows that Vickie finds him attractive. Later , discussing Jake's victory with journalists in a night club, Joey spots Vickie in the company of Salvy and his friends. He attacks Salvy and injures him badly in a fight. The mafia head asks Jake to throw his next match in order to have a title fight. As a result, Jake is disqualified. However, he wins the middleweight title in his next bout against Marcel Cerdan in 1949.<br/><br/>The title win and subsequent success the following year do nothing to quell his jealousy about Vickie, his insecurities only become worse. Things come to the worst one day when he blatantly asks Joey whether he and Vickie have something going in between them. Joey leaves, disgusted. Unmoved, he confronts Vickie asking her the same, to which she replies, fed up of the routine torture, that she has relations with Joey and every man in the neighbourhood. Enraged, Jake goes to Joey's house and beats him up brutally in front of his family. That spells the end of relations between the two brothers. <br/><br/>Jake defends his title against Laurent Dauthille in 1950, a match even his estranged brother Joey watches on TV. He calls Joey in an attempt to reconcile but is unable to speak anything when Joey answers the phone.He never tries to call his brother again. His career slowly starts to go downhill and he loses his title to Sugar Ray Robinson in 1951.<br/><br/>The scene then cuts to 1956 with a now obese LaMotta, having moved to Miami and running a nightclub. Vickie soon asks for a divorce,which she had been planning since his retirement. She gets the custody of the children and moves away. Jake then suddenly gets arrested one morning on the charge of introducing underage girls (posing as 21 year olds) to other patrons of his nightclub. He is jailed being unable to raise enough money for parole even after selling his title belt. In a memorable scene, he bangs his head and pounds the walls of his prison cell, crying and repenting his actions and questioning his misfortune. The scene then moves to 1958.On being freed, he moves back to New York and continues his gigs at various night clubs in addition to managing them. One night, he sees Joey on the street. He calls out to him and asks him to forgive him, but Joey keeps walking. Finally he catches him near his car and hugs him and asks for forgiveness. Joey reluctantly forgives him and drives away without another word. Back to the first scene in 1964 where La Motta is practicing his lines and in between pondering what might have been had things been a little different and had Joey looked out for him .A stagehand informs that his act is ready and the last shot of the film shows Jake exiting the dressing room, shadowboxing like the older days.<br/><br/>This isn't a biopic about a idol because this is anything but a hero. Its a story of a man who inspite of reaching great heights in the ring is pulled down to the abyss because of his abhorrent behaviour outside it. Like his other works, Scorsese does not add a bit of pleasantry but shows realism, with human nature at its ugliest, the usual expletive laced dialogues and grimness.<br/><br/>This is arguably Robert DeNiro's best performance & the most physically demanding role any actor can have.Not for a moment does he even try to make the viewer feel any sympathy for or like the hatred and envy filled character he is playing. Jake LaMotta on screen is the exact opposite to Rocky Balboa . Rocky is a hero in everyman who we root for in his quest to reach for the sky. For Jake, who already has reached the top, the viewer feels only revulsion and later on pity, when he begins his downward slide. To prepare for the role, DeNiro trained vigourously for weeks under the real Jake LaMotta,even fighting and winning some amateur matches. Production was halted for four months and DeNiro went on a binge eating spree on gourmet food across Europe in order to add nearly 30 kilos to portray the older La Motta. On seeing his performance, the real LaMotta quipped ""I never knew that I was that bad"".DeNiro deservedly won the Oscar for the Best Actor for this role where he had in his usual style erased the difference between reality and celluloid.Joe Pesci who was an unknown actor at this time, is great as Joey. He very aptly portrays the brother who tries his best to stick with his sibling but puts and end to the whole thing when it gets beyond redemption. Cathy Moriarty is impressive as Vicky in her debut film but couldn't live upto the promise she showed in this film.<br/><br/>A must watch simply for the appreciation of good cinema."

","Raging Bull is a biographical sports drama film directed by Martin Scorsese, and adapted by Paul Schrader and Mardik Martin from Jake LaMotta's memoir Raging Bull: My Story. It stars Robert De Niro as Jake LaMotta, a middleweight boxer whose sadomasochistic rage, sexual jealousy, and animalistic appetite destroyed his relationship with his wife and family. Also featured in the film are Joe Pesci as Joey, La Motta's well-intentioned brother and manager who tries to help Jake battle his inner demons; and Cathy Moriarty as his abused wife. The film features supporting roles from Nicholas Colasanto, Theresa Saldana, and Frank Vincent.<br/><br/>Scorsese's brutal character study incisively portrays the true rise and fall and redemption of middleweight boxer Jake La Motta, a violent man in and out of the ring who thrives on his ability to take a beating. Opening with the spectacle of the over-the-hill La Motta practicing his 1960s night-club act, the film flashes back to 1940s New York, when Jake's career is on the rise. Despite pressure from the local mobsters, Jake trusts his brother Joey to help him make it to a title bout against Sugar Ray Robinson the honest way; the Mob, however, will not cave in. Jake gets the title bout, and blonde teenage second wife Vickie, but success does nothing to exorcise his demons, even as he channels his rage into boxing. Alienating Vickie and Joey, and disastrously gaining weight, Jake has destroyed his personal and professional lives by the 1950s. After he hits bottom, however, Jake emerges with a gleam of self- awareness, as he sits rehearsing Marlon Brando's On the Waterfront speech in his dressing room mirror: ""I coulda been a contender, I coulda been somebody."" Working with a script adapted by Mardik Martin and Paul Schrader from La Motta's memoirs, Scorsese and De Niro sought to make an uncompromising portrait of an unlikable man and his ruthless profession. Eschewing uplifting Rocky-like boxing movie conventions, their Jake is relentlessly cruel and self-destructive; the only peace he can make is with himself. Michael Chapman's stark black-and-white photography creates a documentary/tabloid realism; the production famously shut down so that De Niro could gain 50-plus pounds.<br/><br/>Though Raging Bull has only three principal characters, it is a big film, its territory being the landscape of the soul.Also,it is arguably Martin Scorsese's and Robert De Niro's finest film as it is often painful to watch, but it's a searing, powerful work about an unsympathetic hero.For that reasons alone,it is a boxing movie masterpiece still brutal,bloody and one of the best films made during the 80's."
"unklechunkle","10","2","2","22 November 2011"," One of the greatest films I have ever seen, with an even better performance!
","I have only seen a handful of Scorsese's films but this is by far the best. The success of the film is largely down to DeNiro's first-class performance as the title boxer, Jake LaMotta. DeNiro had to put on significant weight for the last portion of the film, in which LaMotta degenerates into an overweight, ageing loner performing low-grade comedy in his own sleazy nightclub. This is typical of DeNiro's method acting but DeNiro's performance is so much more than that. His range of emotions in the film is incredible, from jealousy to glory in the ring.<br/><br/>Combined with this is Scorsese's masterful direction of the piece, captured in glorious black and white which gives the film a noir feel at times. Scorsese captures LaMotta's jealousy excellent with slow motion as LaMotta watches his wife kiss and old friend, it is innocent of course but not to LaMotta, whose jealousy and paranoia of the actions of his wife and brother slowly devour him.<br/><br/>The screenplay is also wonderful, being inspired of course by the book from LaMotta himself, but I think the highlight of the film is its final scene, as LaMotta is warming up for a comedy routine and he recites Brando's iconic 'I could've been a contender' speech from On the Waterfront; the irony is incredibly strong."

While these genres have lived on in contemporary movies, the 1960s were the arrival of films with a profound boldness. Discretion was tossed to the wind and subtly was thrown to the wind. This advent of risquÃ© film making was the beginning of a new era, marked predominately by unrestricted sexuality and violence. This has continued on to this day, but certain periods were peaks in these categories. On one end of the stick is a cult horror film like The Evil Dead (Sam Raimi, 1981), which is infamous for its over-the-top gore. Other films, such as Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull (1980) struck viewers with heart pounding realistic violence. Its approach to on-screen violence, acting and cinematography all come together to make the definition of a gritty film making.<br/><br/>The film of old used specific techniques to cement their themes and emotions, and while these varied the mood in specific genres was ever consistent. Pre-sixties horror was that of Them! (Gordon Douglas, 1954), but at the sunset of the fifties, films such as Psycho (Alfred Hitchcock, 1960) began to bend the rules. Of course, the production code which had regulated just what films could show had been done away with. This was the genesis of the new wave era.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro plays the role of the titular character, boxing legend Jake La Motta excellently, but he took method acting to an unprecedented level. De Niro underwent vigorous physical training, much of it with Jake La Motta himself, but that was only the first course. Not just physical strain put on him; he also gained a whole sixty pounds for the post-boxing years portion of the film. Impersonation acting grew vastly from the New Wave era, where actors are not held by contract to play niche roles. It allows true versatility to take hold. <br/><br/>The mise en scene of the film is quite ironic. Film noir was the beginning of Hollywood exposing the darker nature of what went on behind the closed doors of even the most serene family. This film itself is a period piece, and the home of La Motta is very similar to the ideal 40s and 50s suburbs. There is even a cross overlooking the couple's mattress. Despite this, the violence of the character's nature stains into every facet of his life. In that bedroom, with the religious symbol watching it all, the man deals harsh blows to his wife (played by Cathy Moriarty-Gentile). The scene is only one of many that can be hard to watch for squeamish viewers, many critics themselves initially were polarized by the amount of brutality in the film.<br/><br/>The cinematography by Michael Chapman, and without a doubt the editing of Thelma Schnoonmaker is also a real highlight of the film. Note the fight between La Motta and Marcel Cerdan. There is rapid cross-cutting in a series of short takes to give the action a very intense feel. A Dutch angle is used to create distortion as our character takes a brief interlude before re-entering the fray. The whole scene illustrates the chaos of a single fight."

","Raging Bull is a movie of pure raw emotion of anger, jealously, and grief. A film directed by Martin Scorsese, Raging Bull is a prototypical Scorsese movie as it deals with themes of failure for a man to understand the complexities in life. Another Scorsese movie that emulates this theme is ""Taxi Driver"". Raging Bull chronicles a prize fighter's journey through success and ultimate failures. Scorsese puts the viewer in a position to understand that in a prize fighter's mind there is no room to see the things that are happening around him. You see a man who is blinded by his insecurities of jealously and paranoia toward a woman who he is infatuated with.<br/><br/>Raging Bull follows the life of Jake LaMotta who is a hard-nosed, stubborn, punk from Bronx, NY. LaMotta grows up in the slums where he uses his hard knock upbringing to become a boxing prize fighter who wins the middleweight championship. As the fame and money started rolling in, LaMotta loses millions as his jealously, greed, anger, and paranoia get the better of him. Before, LaMotta wins the title there's a flashback to the series of events that has resulted in present day where LaMotta is an old out of shape aspiring comedian.<br/><br/>From the beginning, Jake LaMotta and his brother Joey are the center of controversy. Joey doubles as Jake's sparring partner and fight organizer. Everything seems to take a turn when Jake and Joey make a trip to the public swimming pool where the camera angles to a 15 year old girl named Vickie that catches the eye of Jake. Joey who reiterates to Jake that he is already married; however, decides that he would invite Vickie out for the day. Eventually, Jake marries Vickie where he becomes consumed by the thought that she is cheating on him. By his own jealously and paranoia, LaMotta goes on to use his anger and confusion to win the title and later lose it after his guilt finally is too much to handle. <br/><br/>The movie dwindles down and after a few years Jake LaMotta announces his retirement and his plans for buying a nightclub. This leads to Vickie telling Jake that she wants a divorce and had been planning to since his retirement announcement. As things seem to be crashing down around LaMotta who is soon arrested for introducing men at the nightclub to under-age girls. LaMotta spends nights crying in his cell but eventually serves his time and returns home to New York. Scorsese intertwines the theme throughout the movie of a man being lost within himself confined by the emotions of greed, jealously, and paranoia. In the end it all culminates in his return when he meets up with Joey where they share a nervous moment."
"zschulte","Null","2","2","26 October 2011"," The rise and fall of Jake La Motta.
","Raging Bull is a movie about a young talented boxer named Jake La Motta portrayed by Robert De Niro. Jake La Motta has some very serious anger issues, which I believe is the theme of the movie and a reflection of the title. In the beginning of the movie, Jake La Motta is married to an ordinary woman, but Cathy Moriarty's character Vickie catches his eye at the pool and he decides to take her for a ride in his sports car. One thing leads to another and they eventually get married. The story continues to unfold and shows how Jake La Motta rose to the top of the middleweight boxing division. As he reaches the top, Jake has some anger and trust related issues with his family and friends. After he eventually gets to the top and becomes champion he starts to let himself go. He eats excessively and little romance between him and Vickie cause problems. He accuses his brother Joey (Joe Pesci) of sleeping with his wife and they get in to an argument and Joey leaves Jake's house. Before leaving, Joey tried to convince Jake of how crazy the accusation was, but Jake was very persistent. Jake goes upstairs and confronts Vickie of the affair. Vickie, fed up with being controlled throughout the entire marriage and having done nothing wrong at all, says ""Yeah I f****d your brother. I s****d his c**k too. What do you want me to say? Is that what you want me to say? I did all your friends too!"" Vickie never committed any adultery, but Jake's obsession with feeling like something happened led Vickie to scream those words at Jake for his satisfaction. Jake then walked down to Joey's house and beat the crap out of him. This began as the events of the complete meltdown of Jake La Motta. In his next title defense, he lost the belt and never returned to the ring as a competitor. After his boxing days, Jake opened up a night club where he was the head comedy routine. Vickie leaves him after she cannot take any more physical abuse. Jake is then arrested for serving alcohol and introducing a fourteen year old to men at his club. After he is released from jail, he attempts to get his life together, but to no avail, he is now alone because he is a ""Raging Bull.""<br/><br/>The lighting is especially important to the theme. The lighting of when he is in jail is very dark. He is a raging bull and supposed to be fearless, after Jake furiously punches the wall shouting ""Why, why, why?"" He drops to his knees and begins to sob, however, you cannot see his face because of the lighting"
"tinay0206","Null","2","2","27 July 2011"," Raging Bull, excellent movie, excellent title
","Raging Bull is one of the most intense films that I have ever watched. It is clearly noted that this movie is Martin Scorsese, the director's, best film, and I would have to agree. It is also considered one of the best films of the 1980's. This movie is based on the true story of the boxer, Jake LaMotta. Robert DeNiro plays the role of Jake and does an amazing job. At the beginning of the film, the audience sees a quiet, subdued LaMotta reminiscing about his past and what could have been. The filmmaker uses flashbacks for the viewer to experience the trials and tribulations of Jake's life. Through these flashbacks, the audience realizes that Jake is a much different man than previously thought.<br/><br/>This film showed Jake's violence and ultimate self-destruction. Jake married a fifteen year old girl, Vickie, played by Cathy Moriarty. His brother and biggest ally, Joey, is played by Joe Pesci. The only thing that Jake wanted in his life was a chance at the middle weight title. He finally was given that opportunity and won the belt, but was unable to keep the title when fighting Sugar Ray, his biggest competitor. Even after Sugar Ray beat him profusely, he told Sugar Ray, I never went down; I never went down. After retiring from boxing, he opened up a club and got in trouble with the law for being with underage girls. He accused his wife and brother of having an affair and destroyed the relationships he had with both of them. He was arrested and smashed his belt to remove the jewels for money. He later found himself alone with nothing to look forward to. The theme of Raging Bull is jealousy and the self-destruction that it brings. Jake had everything that he wanted; he was fighting and had a beautiful, young, trophy wife. Through his jealousy, he ruined that relationship. He was always accusing Vickie of being with other men because of his own insecurities. He finally accused Vickie and Joey of having an affair. After fighting both of them, he does not talk to his brother again until the end of the movie. Vickie does forgive him, but eventually leaves him because of his infidelities. It was as if Jake was fighting internal demons throughout his life. His jealousy made him incapable of thinking rationally. He was abusive and self-destructive in regards to this jealousy. He treated everybody with no respect including his own body. He gained weight and drank profusely without regard to his health. This movie proved that mistakes can be forgiven. Although Jake practically beats Joey senseless, he finally forgave him. Vickie forgave him for his violence outside of the ring. Even after Jake hit her, she still loved him enough to try to make the marriage work. The lighting and sound effects in this movie were phenomenal. During the fight scenes, the filmmaker chose a black background with a bright light shining on the boxing ring and the fighters. This allowed the audience to focus completely on the fight without distractions. Another great example of the use of lighting was when Jake was thrown in jail. It was completely dark except for a spot light on Jake. This light enabled the viewer to actually feel the pain, the anguish, the desperation, and loneliness of Jake as he beats his head and fists against the wall. Even though, LaMotta was an extremely violent man, using this lighting allowed the audience to pity him. The sound effects and editing of the fight scenes were amazing. The sounds of music playing, the crowd cheering, the camera snapping, the bell ringing, and the announcer speaker made this movie exceptional. The close ups and slow motion that were used in editing to high-light the fight scenes created the most realistic picture; it made the viewer feel like they were at the fight. This movie is compared to Rocky a lot because these two men shared the same dream, becoming a famous boxer. I believe the reason this movie and Rocky are compared because they portray great boxers that came from poverty and made it. I think that the Rocky movies portray Rocky as a hero and Raging Bull portrays Jake as a regretful has-been that could have been a hero. He could have had class, he could have been a contender, he could have been somebody, but instead he was a bum. These were the last words that Jake LaMotta stated in the movie, Raging Bull. He allowed jealousy to overcome his life. He did not think rationally and slowly self-destructed into what he considered a bum."

"ben-eastwood","10","2","2","20 March 2011"," In My Top 3
","Like I said, this film is in my top 3 films ever made, along with The Shawshank Redemption and Pulp Fiction. I think that it is debatably De Niro's best performance ever (but is he better in taxi driver?), and it was first line up of De Niro, Pesci and Scorsese, one of the best cinematic trios ever. So, enough has been said for me to make even the most cynical people out there believe me that the acting in this is absolutely top quality. The directing is incredible. The stylish black and white makes this stand out among other movies and really gives some strong ground as to when this story was set. The fight scenes are among the best scenes in cinematic history, and the most brutal. Just be warned, this film is not for children. The violence in emotionally intense and the language is foul (yet appropriate and accurate.). Having said that, anyone from fourteen to fifteen should be okay with this. <br/><br/>So if you don't believe me that this is one of the best films ever, at least acknowledge that it is easily the best film of the eighties, which is some achievement."
"khanbaliq2","10","2","2","12 June 2010"," Raging Bull explores the soul of a profoundly violent man and search for the human core buried deep inside him.
","Raging Bull is one of the bloodiest and most beautiful reflections on atonement in director Martin Scorsese's canon... it's still one of the cinema's most breathtaking films. It chronicles the rise to fame of an unlikable but virtually unstoppable middle-weight boxer (Robert De Niro), based on the autobiography of Jake La Motta, nicknamed the Bronx Bull.<br/><br/>Filmed largely in black-and-white, this tough, compelling, powerfully made melodrama takes us uncomfortably close to the jarring action in the ring. An astonishing performance from De Niro, who inhabits the role to an eerie extent, and Scorsese orchestrates events with the aim of capturing the crunching reality of this world. It's brutal, and not a single character truly engages one's sympathy, but there's undeniably a visual poetry about it."
"jpriest75","8","2","2","15 June 2009"," Great Film, Just Not a Favorite
","When I went into watching Raging Bull, I think I set my expectations too high. After hearing all the hype that it made about it being the greatest sports film, I just had to see it. I was not disappointed in the least bit, but by the end, I found that it lacked the same level of emotional girth that other great sports films were so abundant in.<br/><br/>First and foremost, the acting in Raging Bull was undoubtedly one of the best of any film. De Niro was brilliant as the boxing paragon Jake La Motta, both as a young, talented up-and-comer, and a washed-up, overweight drunk. This was definitely one of De Nior's finest performances. Moriarty, at the tender age of nineteen, was perfect opposite the seasoned De Niro, and Joe Pesci gives another in a string of great performances as La Motta's concerned brother/manager.<br/><br/>The film was an homage to the boxing scene in the 40s and 50s. I believe Scorsese shot the film in black-and-white to accent the heavy use of blood in the ring and experimental fight scenes. At some points int the film, the punches looked very fake to me, like in the beginning when La Motta asks Joey to hit him. Even if the punch isn't altogether powerful, a person's head will still fly back a considerable amount.<br/><br/>Raging Bull was an amazing achievement in all respects as I stated before, and I am not bashing it or anyone who enjoys it in any way, but I don't think it will be one of those films that sticks with me. I will hold Raging Bull in high regard as it is a cinematic marvel, but I feel that is a perfect example of an acquired taste."
"tastyhotdogs","9","2","2","19 February 2006"," Brilliant movie, with 1 of the top 5 performances ever by DeNiro
","Hard to sum up in words, but much easier than summing up in hand signals Robert DeNiro + Martin Scorsese + Great Story + Brilliant Script = One of the best movies ever.<br/><br/>""Raging Bull"" tells the true story of Jake La Motta, an early 1900's boxer who went from champion to bum. The story begins with his rise in the boxing world, where his talent is obvious but equally is his womanizing, anger and paranoia. As he rises to champion, things go well for Jake, but when problems arise his character flaws bring about his downfall.<br/><br/>A must see for true movie lovers. An outstanding performance by DeNiro, even better than his effort in ""Analyse This"", who famously put on over 70lb for the role for La Motta's later years. Also great performances by Joe Pesci, in his breakthrough role before ""Home Alone"", and Cathy Moriarty. Outstanding directing by Scorsese, who created the most realistic boxing scenes up until that time, with the black and white effect really adding to the movie. One of the great Hollywood movies."
"jpreich","10","2","2","17 February 2006"," Best movie ever
","Like it says in the summary line, Raging Bull is the best movie ever made. I honestly cannot think of a better looking, better directed, better acted, or more enjoyable movie to watch. The dialogue is top notch, (not as creative as say a Tarantino flick, but about as realistic as I've ever heard in a film), and not only holds your attention, but makes you laugh, cringe, and, (if you're an emotional person), maybe even cry. Directed by Martin Scorsese, it is by far his best film, and ranks him, in my mind, the best director in the industry today, (until he retires that is). I would recommend this movie to anyone, and do quite often, and hope that more people take the time to sit down and take in this masterpiece."
"Sylviastel","10","2","2","16 February 2006"," A Classic Film by even today's standards!
","Martin Scorsese, Joe Pesci, and Robert DeNiro: When these guys get together, you know something big is going to happen and this film is a perfect example of great quality. Raging Bull is Jake LaMotta's rise and fall as an athlete to a nightclub performer. I think this is the film that Joe Pesci shows that even little guys can cause the most harm. When DeNiro and Pesci play the La Motta brothers, you believe it because they have such great chemistry with each other. I don't think Pesci was ever intimidated by Scorsese or DeNiro. This film earned DeNiro his second Academy Award and you can see why. Not only is the transformation, physical but emotional and psychological as well. These characters are flawed, human, and believable with great cast of actors. Don't forget Cathy Moriarty who was discovered to play Jake's young second wife. Even at 18, she can play younger and older and believable. His second wife can be beautiful and smart but trapped in a fractured marriage. She deserved her Academy Award Nomination for Best SUpporting Actress because she can handle herself against DeNiro and we see how he fell in love with her. Don't forget Pesci's wife is played Theresa Saldana who does hold her own. This film shows that black and white can still be beautiful film work. Nicholas Colasanto from Cheers is also in the film as well in a small role. Scorsese's best films are with DeNiro and Pesci at least in my opinion. At the end of the film, I wanted to know more about these characters."

Cinderella Man, Rocky, Million Dollar Baby, and Ali are not as good as this film. It is magnificently shot- EXCELLENT CINEMATOGRAPHY- the score works wonderfully with the story- the rise and fall of boxing star Jake LaMotta. I am convinced that Robert DeNiro delivers one of the greatest acting performances of movie history. He is literally up there with Marlon Brando and rightfully received the Best Actor Oscar of 1980. I am shocked that Raging Bull did not receive Best Picture. Maybe for its time, the language and sexual dialogue was not too appreciated. Don't let this deter you from seeing the movie. Joe Pesci and Robert DeNiro work very well together and this is Martin Scorsese's greatest film. Taxi Driver, Gangs of New York or GoodFellas could not top this film. A true cinema masterpiece. 10/10."

","Martin Scorsese is a wonderful director and although he has had the occasional bad film such as Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore or Gangs of New York but has also had many amazing films such as this Ragin Bull which may actually be his best slightly above such masterpieces as Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, and Casino. Robert De Niro gives one of his best performances as Jake La Motta. He is phenomenal and deserved his Best Actor Oscar, although he has been better in both Taxi Driver and The Godfather Part 2. But the best performances are in the supporting categories by Joe Pesci and Cathy Moriarty, Moriarty in particular is wonderful. She gives one of the best performances in film history and blows everyone else out of the water. The screenplay is also wonderfully written with flawless dialogue and some of the best character development since Casablanca. The boxing scenes are wonderfully shot and are possibly the best boxing scenes ever shot. Raging Bull is without a doubt one of the best films ever made. You must see it!"

","This film heightens the dynamic and strength of the De niro/Scorsese relationship. As both men were on the brink of an emotional abyss like la motta and both De niro/Scorsese put their efforts into the film and in the end result created a masterpiece. With it's amazing screenplay by Schrader, Scorsese's direction and the relationship between De niro and Joe Pesci made for a cinematic masterpiece despite the contempt the audience has for la motta and poor box office sales when released in 1980. This film will be remembered for the scenes between Jake la motta and his brother which let us delve into the mind of a emotionally self destructive man. As for regards acting this film will be remembered for the transformation of De niro, with his belief in method acting and earing the right to play a character, transformed himself to the physicality of a real middle weight boxer enabling him to fight in actual boxing matches. De niro, then adds on 60 pounds to play Jake la motta later in life. Due to the transformations, this earned De niro the best actor award and confirmed him as one of the greatest actors of all time. However this film will be most remembered for the theft from Scorsese as the greatest thief of all time Robert Redford stole the Best Director award off Scorsese in broad daylight for his film ordinary people.

"ChigurandSpice","10","2","2","21 November 2005"," Scorcese's Personal Masterpiece- a Must See
","Probably the most deeply affecting film I have ever seen, Raging Bull towers as a masterpiece of cinema. Scorcese's personally urgent portrait of a man in need of redemption, it is the most powerful film I have ever seen. Watchable multiple times, Raging Bull contains astonishing scenes of pure, unbridled emotional truth; as well as intense, raw fight scenes.<br/><br/>It is the tragic story of Jake LaMotta, a boxer who in the ring was never knocked down. He experienced little but downfall in his personal life, as his paranoid torment and sexual inadequacy drove him to alienate everyone that he had loved.<br/><br/>At home he was paralyzed by suspicions of his young wife, Vicky, cheating on him. In the ring he punishes her and himself by dealing out and receiving incredible amounts of pain as his payment for a deeply sinful nature.<br/><br/>Scorcese's work ranks with the greatest portraits of tortured artists (by that I mean both LaMotta, and Scorcese at the time) in this film which was made by Scorcese because of how strongly he related to the fundamental male need to torture himself over his lack of understanding towards women.<br/><br/>In Mean Streets and Taxi Driver, Scorcese's hero's guilt led them to hold their fists over flames, testing the fires of Hell. In Raging Bull, Scorcese sends Jake LaMotts into a pounding, animalistic, physical Hell on earth every time he steps into the brutal, unforgiving ring.<br/><br/>Scorcese's choice choice to film in crisp black and white gives the film an authentic but surreal tone that brings it closer to real life than most movies. It is beautifully shot, and the black and white elevates it to a timeless, mythic place in the viewers mind.<br/><br/>Robert Deniro's performance as Jake LaMotta can never be matched or compared. It leaves the realm of performance and instead is an embodiment. Famously gaining sixty pounds for the tragically extraordinary final moments, Deniro finds moments of unbelievable power and uncompromising truth in a man flawed not because he is evil; but so uncontrollably, paralyzingly human. It ranks alongside Charlize Theron's performance in Monster as the number one piece of acting in the history of cinema.<br/><br/>Failing miserably at the box office (Raging Bulls filming budget was 18 million, compared to its box office take of 0 million), and unloved by critics who felt that it was an ugly story about ugly people, Raging Bull was not a financial success story. Instead it was discovered over the years as the art that it was and is now considered one of the best films of all time.<br/><br/>Any honest person who watches this film will find a riveting, emotionally draining film about what it means to be human. One of very, very few films that I found lived up to all of its expectations and beyond. It occupies a powerful place in my mind, and in the history of film."

"bval-3","10","2","2","27 July 2005"," The finest example of Scorsese's brilliance
","A marvel of a movie; a spot-on analysis of one man's aggression and insecurity; an eternal cinematic treasure: Martin's Scorsese's 1980 black-and-white biopic of a middleweight boxing legend is stark, striking, and nothing short of brilliant. Raging Bull is by far the premium product of the Scorsese/De Niro tandem and one of the finest films ever made.<br/><br/>The film chronicles the rise and fall of Jake LaMotta (Robert De Niro), a middleweight boxing legend during the 1940s and '50s, whose bouts with Sugar Ray Robinson (Johnny Barnes) put him at both the top and bottom of his game. Throughout the picture, LaMotta is depicted as a man of accessible rage and disheartening jealousy, and it is his wife Vickie (Cathy Moriarty) and brother Joey (Joe Pesci) who stir these emotions. The boxing ring merely serves as an arena for LaMotta to unleash his anger without remorse.<br/><br/>Scorsese's choice to shoot Raging Bull in black-and-white (except for a few home-movie sequences) perfectly complements the gritty storyline. Scorsese's decision to make his boxers' blood look inky black versus bright red is alone a testament to his sensational style. His direction here is absolutely superb. In fact, the final bout between Sugar Ray and LaMotta, that closes with, ""You never got me down Ray. You never got me down."" and a shot of the blood soaked rope, is my favorite sequence by any director, in any film, in any genre. It is a crying shame that Scorsese did not win the Oscar for best director in 1980 and even worse that Raging Bull did not win Best Picture.<br/><br/>On the upside, De Niro did take home the gold for best actor. His performance is single-handedly the greatest male acting I have ever encountered. De Niro's work here is near equivalent to a master course in theater. From his chiseled animalistic form in the ring, to his overweight pitiable figure who quotes Marlon Brando from On the Waterfront at the film's close, De Niro is at his best and his performance promises to wow the dreariest of viewers.<br/><br/>In addition, Cathy Moriarty and Joe Pesci dish out phenomenal performances. Cathy, at age 19, pulls off Vickie as both a 15 year-old girl and an aging distressed wife, while Joe Pesci plays Joey with the same demeanor he later applied to his Academy Award winning role in Scorsese's Goodfellas.<br/><br/>Finding faultless direction and flawless all-around acting occurring in concert is truly an unconditional indulgence. Raging Bull represents cinematic excellence; it is a heat-seeking missile of a movie. It is an unavoidable knockout that will eventually cross your path, and when it does, you will not only feel its impact, but you will also come to appreciate how utterly perfect and unmerciful movies can be."

","Raging Bull was labeled by critics the greatest film of the 1980s. Their exactly right. Many also put Raging Bull at the top of the list of the best pictures by Martin Scorsese. Personally, I think that Taxi Driver is Scorsese's best, and that Raging Bull is his second best. But it's still pretty close between them. Robert De Niro deserved his Oscar for playing Jake La Motta. I think that this is his finest piece of acting. I said in another review that I loved the fact that this film is black and white. I can not imagine it in color and the black and white texture seems to add so much to the story. It fits De Niro's character, who seems to only see things in black and white as he breaks down. It's interesting that the filming of Raging Bull in black and white was done because Scorsese realized that, after filming for a while, that the boxing gloves were the wrong color. They were red. They were supposed to be brown. So, on the spot, he decided to switch to black and white. Brilliant. Some of the greatest decisions are made due to small mistakes. Watch this movie if you have not seen it. It's the best boxing movie ever. Better than Rocky, Million Dollar Baby, and Cinderella Man."

Though not recognized as such at the time of the film's original release, and somewhat eclipsed in popularity by the later successes of ""Casino"" and ""Goodfellas"", it is in ""Raging Bull that Scorsese really hits his stride. The film is a not-so-fictional, often critical and harsh account of real life boxing legend, Jake LaMotta (Robert DeNiro). Not that LaMotta would disagree with that assessment.<br/><br/>In fact he would probably add that the film pales in comparison to the sort of jerk he was with his first wife, Vickie (Cathy Moriarty). Scorsese, not a fan of boxing at the start of production, sinks deep into the material and comes out swinging as the undisputed champion. The evocative black and white (except for rare color sequence) cinematography really captures the mood and feel of old time boxing news reels. Of course the other half that makes the story sparkle like no other sports movie before or since, and cannot be overstated, is Robert DeNiro's masterful performance as Jake.<br/><br/>Gaining and losing some sixty pounds for the shoot, in every ounce of his being and delivery, DeNiro is LaMotta. The line between character and actor is so poignantly blurred that the performance stands out as genuine and raw in its reverence and sincerity to both LaMotta and the sport. Joe Pesci, who at this point in his career had almost decided that acting was not for him, establishes an indelible light as Joey LaMotta that would continue to burn in his many works since this one - both with and without Scorsese. The rest of the cast, hand picked by Scorsese for their non-actor-eque qualities, come off as real life patrons of the ring, an inspired artistic mileau that with each new viewing seems more like a hidden camera account of LaMotta than its fictional equivalent. DeNiro rightfully took home the Best Actor Oscar for ""Raging Bull"". Scorsese and the film were wrongfully overlooked.<br/><br/>MGM/UA has given us a stunning new transfer of ""Raging Bull"". The black and white image is smooth, beautifully contrasted and very nicely balanced. Blacks are deep and rich. Whites are generally clean, except where Scorsese has deliberately toned down the contrast for artistic effect. Fine detail is fully realized throughout.<br/><br/>There is no edge enhancement or other digital glitches for a picture quality that is staggeringly beautiful in all of its sustained and intense glory. The faded color sequences, deliberately rendered that way, are poignant snapshots of a private life that add yet another layer to the telling of this tale. The audio, remixed to 5.1, like the Raging Bull himself, packs an incredible one/two wallop. The sound field is engaging, intense and always on pitch. Extras include a string of interesting documentaries that chart the film from conception to post production. LaMotta as well as DeNiro are on hand to comment. There's even a side by side LaMotta to DeNiro fight sequence to compare styles in fighting. The film's theatrical trailer, a gallery and audio commentary round out the extras."
"mOVIemAN56","10","2","2","29 May 2005"," An Excellent Biography and Boxing Film
","I had heard so much about this film throughout my years but never had the time to rent it or catch it on TV. Well I finally decided to rent the film and I must say, this is Scorcese's best film.<br/><br/>The film is a biography of infamous boxer Jake La Motta played by Robert De Niro, middle-weight champion and a bit insane at the same time. The film takes the viewer through famous boxing matches and his personal life with his odd friendship with his brother Joey (Joe Pesci in his best performance ever) and his fifteen year old wife Vickey (Cathy Moriarty). <br/><br/>The movie is well-filmed with excellent cinematography by Scorcese and Michael Chapman. The use of both slow-motion scenes and fast-paced frantic scenes are beautifully used to portray the film in an emotionally charged way. The film really shows the struggles that La Motta suffered the verge of insanity he was constantly touching.<br/><br/>Joe Pesci surprised me and in my mind does the best acting of his career. De Niro is fantastic and overshadows Pesci a little. He's cruel, he's powerful, and he is emotional. The directing is brilliant and the acting superb. <br/><br/>Raging Bull. Starring: Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Cathy Moriarty, Frank Vincent, and Nicholas Colasanto.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 Stars."
"tsar_ina","Null","2","2","14 April 2005"," A classic film - phenomenal acting
","Film was shot in black and white but it didn't matter while watching the move. The story of a boxer who deals with life based on his own instincts but realises his follies as age catches up with his life. Brilliant direction with display of the scenes sequence in a very good manner. Editing of the movie is sparkling. Acting of Di Nero and Pesci is phenomenal. Di Nero's acting and appearance would take anyone's breath away. Such a dedicated performance. He has given all his best efforts in the most effective way which has given full color to the movie. His acting has made other areas of film excel. If you have not watched this movie don't hesitate to watch it. I am sure you will relish watching the performance of direction and acting by the film stars. A great movie."
"Ric-7","10","2","2","2 April 2005"," Surprising After 25 Years
","I avoided seeing this film until today. Despite the awards and almost uniformly good reviews, I was not attracted by the thought of a realistic boxing film, and so I never saw this film either in theatres, or on cable. I rented the DVD today and watched it, and I was mesmerized throughout. I understand this film came out during the year of Chariots of Fire. If that is true, then Scorsese was robbed, in my opinion. This film was even better than The Aviator.<br/><br/>I'm glad I was not aware how the film ends, and so I am calling this comment a spoiler. Jake sitting before a mirror rehearsing Brando's ""contender"" speech from On The Waterfront--it left me weak when I realized what was occurring. An actor playing a real boxer rehearsing a speech given in a film by an actor playing a fictional boxer. And both actors won Oscars for giving that speech. That scene was so simple, so unexpected, yet so true to the rest of the film.<br/><br/>There was not a dull moment in it, and unlike some of Scorsese's subsequent films, the film presented its story very economically, without unnecessary effects and unnecessary scenes."
"policy134","9","2","2","25 March 2005"," De Niro at his worst and also best.
","Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese together can only be described as the definitive symbol of cinematic excellence. They have a profound understanding of each other that everybody should aspire to, whether they're in show business or not.<br/><br/>Raging Bull is the ultimate Scorsese/De Niro collaboration and the snub it got from the Academy was a grim reminder where movies in the 80's where headed. Instead of making more of these quality films together, Scorsese and De Niro were virtually absent in the 80's. It wasn't until '88 that De Niro made sort of a comeback with Midnight Run. Scorsese was producing a few films but he wasn't the major influence he had been in the 70's.<br/><br/>The film Raging Bull also introduced Joe Pesci to a worldwide audience. He had only made an obscure film in the mid-70's which was virtually unseen except De Niro who recommended him to play Jake LaMotta's brother, Joey. Another newcomer was the actress playing Jake's wife, Vicki. She was barely out of high school when she was hired. This is by far, De Niro's absolute best performance and of course he also won the Oscar, but it is also the performance that is the hardest to watch. Every single moment he's on screen is like spending time with your worst enemy. He is such an ugly person that you can't sympathize with him at all. The thing that makes him somewhat redeemable is that he never thinks of himself as a good person. He knows, he is trash but the power to change is not in him. At the end, where he tries to make up with his brother is the most painful moment ever filmed and there doesn't seem to be any change in his character. Apparently, the real LaMotta saw the whole film and was himself disgusted of the way he was portrayed but only at himself.<br/><br/>De Niro has had a long career and he is always worth watching but in this film I must admit that he gave me the creeps from start to finish. Even his role in Cape Fear wasn't as disturbing as this one. So did it deserve to win the Oscar for Best Picture. Yes it did but not because the story is really compelling. It deserved to win because every minute of the film you feel something, even though it's mostly bad feelings."
"benhealeyjr","9","2","2","16 March 2005"," Masterfully acted and directed, but a tiny bit overrated.
","Before I get attacked, let me just explain why I feel RAGING BULL may be a little, tiny, slight bit overrated. We're talking about a film that numerous critics have named the best of the 1980s. Now the 80s were a pretty weak time for film, and RAGING BULL is a beautiful motion picture, but the very best? It's up there with FULL METAL JACKET, MILLER'S CROSSING, RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, THE SHINING, FERRIS BUELLER, DAS BOOT, etc, as a great 80s movie, but I've never been convinced that this film lives up to the hype. I dare say that Scorsese's own TAXI DRIVER and GOODFELLAS are even more impressive. But I'm harping too much on reputation and expectation. DeNiro, Pesci, and Moriarity are outstanding, and Scorsese's direction is exhilarating. Furthermore, the cinematography is gorgeous, the music is unforgettable, and the boxing scenes are staged perfectly. Try to go in without expectation, and you'll be impressed."
"darkfalafel","9","2","2","8 February 2005"," That's Entertainment
","One of the reasons that makes this movie great that it includes three big names : Martin Scorsese , Paul Schrader , and Robert De Niro . This triplet did together another great movie which was ( Taxi Driver ) in 1976 . For a start , Martin Scorsese who didn't win the Oscar for this piece of art ( as usual ) did a great job by using special effects like close - ups and slow motion techniques in the boxing ring that made us feel as we're there watching , and sometimes boxing . The use of black and white in shooting the movie gave the film its documentary-like to the 40's.<br/><br/>De Niro's role as this mad - destructive - full of pride boxer who could've been something big was truly amazing, and is considered to be one of the greatest roles ever played in the history of cinema , besides Marlon Brando's role in the Godfather and F. Murray Abraham's role in Amadeus . <br/><br/>Raging Bull was nominated for 8 Academy Awards and only won for best Actor and best Editing . But the Oscars aren't the things that makes a movie great , it's the way people think of it that does . In this movie , victory becomes loss , and the feelings of anger, sarcasm, sadness, pain and regret combines together to form this unforgettable cinematic experience . Truly , That's entertainment ."
"Diablo_GTA","10","2","2","16 August 2004"," An exciting and beautiful film.
","I went out to Blockbusters last night and decided to check out Raging Bull after hearing a good review from a friend. After seeing it for the second time, I was quite impressed. The first time I watched it, I felt as if it wasn't worth all the hype it's been given and it seemed to have started in an odd way for me, a way I didn't like. I didn't really know what was happening on screen... so much, that I started it over about thirty minutes into the movie in an attempt to catch everything. The whole Vickie at the pool scene really seemed to throw me off for some reason, heh.<br/><br/>However, this morning, I woke up and decided to give it another chance. I realized a lot more this time around and really got into the overall style of the film that seemed to be missing the first time around. De Niro was, of course, excellent... but what really seemed to stand out for me was Pesci's performance as Jake La Motta's brother, Joey. He played the role very well, I thought... almost as if he knew the guy. I also felt that Frank Vincent did a fine job as Salvy.<br/><br/>Moving on to what it's all about, Raging Bull takes you into the the real story of boxer Jake La Motta and the problems he not only faced in the ring, but outside of it as well. Including some of the greatest boxing sequences I've seen in motion pictures, Scorsese shows once again what a good film is all about. Certainly one of my favorites, I can't wait to pick up the DVD to own for myself."
"wklaudem","Null","2","2","1 April 2004"," definitely see this one
","Plain and simple, `Raging Bull' is an awesome movie.  Being black and white definitely makes the movie ten times better.  The couple scenes where the movie changes to color flow so smoothly from black and white to color you barely notice it.  There were some cool views in the ring where you look up on Jake and the other fighter's faces.  Also there was a lot of cameras flashing and clicking all the time.  I felt that it was just messy and bloody enough without overdoing it.<br/><br/>
The movie is a great film about a man's dreams and hopes, and how he is simply a human.  Jake's pride is eventually what drives everyone he cared about away from him.  Definitely watch this one.  De Niro is absolutely awesome and his acting was superb.  If I had more than two thumbs I would give it numerous thumbs up, but since I only have two:  Two thumbs up."
"oneflewovertheapocalypse","Null","2","2","3 April 2004"," Powerful Stuff
","When looking at the real Jake La Motta and watching De Niro portray him in the movie it's hard to believe that he is the real person.   On the DVD I was shocked to even see that La Motta was still alive but he came across as a very humorous person that enjoyed life.   I know he is a comedian and his job is to be humorous but he didn't seem like the La Motta we know in Raging Bull.  It was funny also when the documentary starts because its cuts to him and he says `When I came out of the theatre after seeing Raging Bull I felt depressed and I asked my Ex wife Vicky was I really like that, and she said no you were worse'.  To think that he couldn't get any worse than he was in the movie.   Raging Bull told the story not like the rise and fall of Jake La Motta but more the fall and fall of him.  Of course winning his heavy weight title was great but Scorsese looks more at his relationships with the people that love him like his brother Joey played Joe Pesci and his wife Vicky played by Cathy Moriaty.   <br/><br/>The physical abuse which is given out in this film is more than you're usual take and it tells it so well.  It's nothing like Rocky or any other boxing Biopic as it shows the human side to a boxer not the just the fighting side. It dwells in well with it's plots and has the greatest fighting scenes ever devised on film and without it being to bloody either as Scorsese shot it very artistically.   <br/><br/>This is the movie that Scorsese deserved to win Best Director out of all his nominations and it is also the most powerful film I have ever seen."
"marke8603","10","2","2","11 February 2004"," Excellent film-making in every aspect
","I went into this movie, having heard good things about it but not knowing what would entail, thinking I was going to watch a Rocky film with perhaps a little more class. When it ended, I sat through the credits, just thinking, almost scarred by LaMotta's life. It was a journey, pure and simple. There was no climactic ending, but the fist thrusts at the end hurt me, and pretty much summarised the film itself. He just couldn't escape the rage and passion of the ring. I became so attatched to the character, and related to his every characteristic. A ""real life"" character played to the best possible effect by DeNiro. The directing and editing, too, keeps the story moving fluently and with a unique style, some effects in the ring actually reflecting the mood and atmosphere of a real fight perfectly. The Black and whiteness is indeed a brave step taken by, in my opinion, a brave and most worthy director. It emphasises the gritty, dry, and realistic approach to the lives of these brilliantly acted characters. The fight scenes could have been coreographed more realistically, but hey, this is film world. A few characters fade, leaving empty spaces to be filled, but the film moves on swiftly. Some may argue that the film could have been a bit shorter, but every minute worth of plot in there is vital to the overall impression of our main character. Everything collapses in the man's life, and we go from scene to scene feeling loss after loss after such emphatic highs. Great emotional impact helped by wonderfully emotional acting. I can identify with the realism of the character after the recent evidence of Frank Bruno's downfall, leading him into a mental hospital. It's the love of the game and the thrill of the fight that drive these characters out of moral society. Anyway, enough, this film strikes all the right chords, and rightly should be acclaimed as one of the top few films of the 80s for it's originality and character development."
"karldevos33","10","2","2","16 July 2004"," Masterpiece
","One of the greatest films ever produced. A masterpiece. This movie assured Scorsese the status of being one of the single most important American artists in the history of cinema. This film is heavily influenced by the French Nouvelle Vague. Some cuts and shots are lifted from Truffaut's 'Jules et Jim' and Godard's 'A Bout de Souffle'. But Scorsese's own highly authentic voice assures the audience of a very unique viewing experience. It's almost unmeasurable how many filmmakers were directly influence by this film and his other work. I remember meeting Scorsese in Knokke-Le-Zoute in '68 when he won the Festival Award for his short 'The Big Shave'. He said half-jokingly that his filmwork would only ever be fully appreciated in Europe because he is so inspired by the European directors of the fifties and the sixties and shares their sensibilities. Unfortunately this predicament has been true. Martin Scorsese has been denied an Oscar his entire career but has won, since Knokke-Le-Zoute, every major award in Europe. The Academy should better hurry up and make up for their mistake! Give Marty that statue. And then give him another one! He's the best you've got!!"
"naturalbornranter","10","2","2","6 January 2004"," Boxing Biography
","""Raging Bull"" is a dark, and disturbing close up study of middle-weight boxer Jake ""The Bull"" LaMotta.<br/><br/>First up, do not try to make any comparisons with ""Rocky"".  The films, while from a similar era, are far too different to compare.  Whereas ""Rocky"" is, ultimately, a feel-good flick, ""Raging Bull"" is a biography full of violence and self-destruction.<br/><br/>Two things in particular that make this film stand out are firstly the fight scenes themselves.  The close-up camera angles, combined with the incredible use of sound editing really enables the audience to ""feel"" every single punch as LaMotta gives himself over to a pummelling.<br/><br/>Secondly, this may well be Robert DeNiro's finest hour.  DeNiro is so personal in his style and so exact in his representation of real-life, that you sometimes feel almost embarrassed to be watching him, during some of the more disturbing scenes (those that take place outside of the ring).<br/><br/>
""Raging Bull"" is a phenom, and alongside ""Taxi Driver"", ""GoodFellas"", ""Casino"" and ""Gangs Of New York"", undoubtedly one of Scorsese's finest works."
"billsav57","Null","2","2","17 November 2003"," amazing
","I saw this movie when it came out and was amazed by it. But what makes it fascinating for me to see it again these days is that a couple of years later, I got to spend some time with Jake LaMotta, and that certainly affects my viewing of the movie. I met with LaMotta at a small Italian restaurant/bar in Pennsylvania, and my memories of that are 1) the fact that he blew smoke in my face, and everybody's face, constantly; 2) the way the people who ran the place treated him as if he was a god -- I must have heard the word ""Champ"" a hundred times that night; and 3) the fact that LaMotta, for all his bluster, actually was pretty honest about his life and the movie. He didn't duck anything to do with the movie -- he claimed his real life was even more violent and wild, but he might just have been bragging or, pardon the pun, blowing smoke. And, despite the fact that everyone else felt the need to play Ed McMahon all night when ""Champ"" was spitting out his one-liners, I can tell you first-hand that his jokes really, really, really are not in the least bit funny."
"noahf210","10","2","2","20 April 2003"," Incredible
","This movie is undoubtedly Martin Scorcese's and Robert De Niro's best work together and is in my opinion one of the greatest movies ever made. It's perfect in every way. The boxing scenes are violent and real and Scorcese makes you really feel like youre there. The black and white was a perfect touch in achieving the nitty-gritty feel of the film. But Raging Bull's real triumph isn't the boxing scenes or Jake La Motta's path to the middleweight world championship, but the portrayal of La Motta's character and his path to ruin.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro as Jake La Motta was one of the greatest acting jobs of all time. I can honestly say that I can never once tell that he isn't actually living that life and is in front of a camera. In the film, Jake La Motta is definitely a messed up dude, and it his self- destructive nature that is Raging Bull's main focus. Ultimately, La Motta crumbled into a divorced, fat criminal and a mere shadow of the troubled but brave man he used to be. Almost equalling de Niro are Joe Pesci as La Motta's brother and Cathy Moriarty as Jake's wife. The dialogue between the two brothers flows well and is quite often hilarious. All in all, a magnificent acting performance, and De Niro's oscar for best actor was well deserved.<br/><br/>The only complaint I have about this movie is at the end when Robert De Niro quotes Marlon Brando from On The Waterfront. Even though Brando's words fit La Motta's situation extremely well, I wish Raging Bull hadn't used an excerpt from a different movie and had spoken for itself. But, aside from that, this movie is perfect in pretty much every way."
"silverchair01","Null","2","2","18 February 2003"," Truly Amazing
","Raging Bull is one of those films that nobody really wanted to make and no companies really wanted to fund but, when they finally do get made it's that gritty grubby atmosphere in their pre-production stages that often pull the films to glorious highs and fantastic praise.<br/><br/>Perhaps my favourite American film alongside The Godfather Part 2, Raging Bull triumphs on all levels.  The great Oscar winning performance from De Niro is truly a classic performance alongside brilliant supporting roles Pesci and Moriarty.<br/><br/>It took alot of guts on Scorsese's part to shoot the film in all black and white (except for one tiny scene) but i'm very glad he did as it increases the atmosphere ten times and gives the film a some personal and intimate feel most notably in the fight scenes.<br/><br/>The fight scenes are filmed masterfully using large clean boxing rings for the early fights when La Motta is up and coming and full of energy and then changing to smaller, grubby rings alongside hazy effects over the scene to show La Motta downfall and the loss of his ability in the later fights.<br/><br/>Overall Raging Bull is praticulary faultless and is deserving of viewing and purchasing by anyone that is even a little bit interested in film.<br/><br/>10/10"
"LagerLagerLagerShouting","9","2","2","30 January 2003"," A Classic.
","How did this film only win two Oscars? (Deserved ones at that!) It is easily won of the best films in the 80's and with hindsight everyone gives this classic the recognition it deserves. I do not know much about boxing but I can understand from Raging Bull the brutality of life in the ring and how it effects people, like Jake LaMotta in their normal lifestyle. My all time favourite actor, Robert De Niro, masterfully portrays LaMotta as a determined character whose aggression and brutality that he he feels in the sport transcends into his life. In the final monologue he is almost a fallen hero as he wonderfully conveys his life in a passioned soliloquy. Scorsese uses classic film-making techniques, in depth, almost psychological, characterisation and sudden bursts of conflict, retribution and remorse to make the film very human indeed. Ultimately this is character driven drama at its finest and more this helps the film to flow excellently through the contrasts of LaMotta's domestic violence with his professional violence, which as brutal as it is, is not played for hatred but questions morality and on a deeper levels strives to be sympathetic. What also helps the relationship of the characters is the improvising, especially between DeNiro and Pesci. They argue and fight with great conviction and DeNiro especially is very believable (probably due to the amount of time he pent with LaMotta!)<br/><br/>Raging Bull is a masterpiece of direction and acting and a great film overall. The violence is very believable and realistic, amazing for a low budget film, and the beautiful black and white cinematography gives it extra, effective depth and a nostalgic sheen. It is a film that has everything and this is shown through the life of a influential if brutal man. Riveting, immaculate and emotional, this is a must see, especially for anyone who enjoys the work of Robert DeNiro and Martin Scorsese.<br/><br/>9/10"
"Butch Cassidy","9","2","2","26 October 2002"," Harsh, Brutal and Violent and that's outside the ring!
","****SPOILERS MAY BE IN HERE SO BEWARE****<br/><br/>Not so long ago Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro would pair up to produce a stunning film that would be applauded by the audience and critics alike but recently neither have chosen to work together. This is a great shame as the films produced were ground breaking and thought provoking. One of these films was Raging Bull.<br/><br/>With only about 12 minutes of boxing being in you would be forgiven for thinking that this film is boring, it is never in the slightest bit tedious or long winded but instead the events outside the ring that show the sordid parts of La Motta's life are intriguing and complement the fight scenes like wine with a well prepared meal.<br/><br/>The main asset of this film has to be its fight scenes which are legendary and ingeniously fabricated by Scorsese. These are some of the best choreographed in cinema history, well above the standard of the Rocky series. This film is certainly not for the faint heart as it is filled with abusive language and violence from the outset. A quality which makes this film one of the greatest films of all-time is the way the film manages to look deeper, rather than just showing the fight scenes, by making the boxer Jake La Motta (Robert De Niro) human and suffers decline into mediocrity.<br/><br/>
This human element injected by De Niro makes us empathise with his character instead of righting him of as a violent thug who we want to suffer. If you ever get the chance to see this film on the big screen then I truly recommend it as the scenes seem more powerful and more meaningful than shown at home. A must see for any Scorsese or De Niro fan.<br/><br/>Grade A"

","There is just one word that can describe every aspect of this movie: BRILLIANT.<br/><br/>The acting for one: Robert De Niro delivers his best performance about the tormented boxer Jake LaMotta constantly struggling with the money and the fame his boxing gives him. But mostly he is tormented by himself. The sheer fact that DeNiro was willing to gain 20 kilos for this role instead of using a prostetic is absolutely amazing. The commitment this man has to roles he loves. Joe Pesci displays his usual brilliance in the hot-headed Italian guy role. The supporting cast is nothing short of brilliant also. Cathy Moriarty is very believable as the wife who is bullied around the clock by LaMotta because of his insecurities. I can of course try to praise everybody here personally, but that would take up too much space.<br/><br/>The other tremendous star of this movie is the editing. Thelma Schoonmaker has done a brilliant job of combining different speeds of film footage and everything. Martin Scorsese is totally in his element surrounded by the people he loves to work with the most: screenwriters Paul Schrader and Mardik Martin are at their best.<br/><br/>Photography was beautiful in its glorious B&W with a few patches of color.

","First of all this movie is not about boxing. It is about a fighter. Someone who has no good qualities what so ever. He fights constantly with the people around him and also uses his anger in the ring. The women he meets is the only thing in his life that brings him happiness ( notice in the montage sequence with the music playing the shots through the home video recorder of his family and wife are the only scenes in color which are disturbed with pictures of his fights in black in white witch represent his character clashing with family). Also, the film is about how the choices you make as a young person can drastically effect the rest of your life. Robert De Niro's performance is the most painfully realistc piece of acting I have ever seen. Martin Sorsesse's directing is also the finest in the history of cinema. Also, Thelma Schoobaker's film editing is the most meticulouse and brilliant ever. Joe Pesci, for the first time gives a fully rounded performance as Jake La Matta's younger brother. This film has a lot of heart and has more about life in it than any other. Jake La Matta is a terrible person who, by the end of his destructive life, when he is a fat bum working as a stande up comedian in skanky lounges, then and only then does he understand what it means to be human, of course by then he is a lonley sad man."

An outstanding performance by him as the fighter Jake LaMotta gained him a deserved Oscar and lord only knows why the film itself did not clear up at the Academy Awards that year.It's hard to imagine a film about boxing could be so beautiful, but from the opening sequence and the splendid music that accompanies it, you know the film is something special.My favourite film of all time."

","Robert De Niro gives a true tour-de-force in this, Martin Scorsese's operatic adaptation of the story of prizefighter Jake La Motta, based on his book. Shot in glorious black and white, with a terrific editing job by Thelma Schoonmaker,  the film also offers what is considered De Niro's greatest performance in a illustrious career. De Niro plays La Motta with searing realism during his years as a fighter and his days as an overweight (De Niro actually gained roughly 50 lbs. to play La Motta at that point in his life) , third-rate comedian in his own nightclub. Joe Pesci and Cathy Moriarty give notable performances as Joey an Vickie La Motta, Jake's brother and wife. La Motta's is a story of a man who was a champion at one time, but fell into a self-destructive state, a broken man and a failure. Scorsese's bravura comes though fully as well, telling the story of such a repulsive figure, and still turning in a piece which gives us a feel of Shakespearean tragedy."

If you're a movie buff you can't AFFORD to miss this. Best film of the 80's right here."
"diffusionx","10","2","2","20 June 2000"," An Experience Unmatched in Film
","What makes Raging Bull so good is that it is a biographical movie that avoids the trap of hero worship. Martin Scorsese made a movie that is about a boxer, but it's not about boxing; rather, it's about the person. He obviously cared quite a bit about telling the story of Jake LaMotta, and the end result is a superb movie. <br/><br/>Of course, it doesn't hurt that Robert DeNiro gives one of the finest acting performances I've ever seen. Every time I watch it, I am amazed by how well he defines his character and how he becomes him in every way. Even minor scenes, like the first conversation he has with his brother, are so perfectly acted (by all parties) that it's a futile effort to stop watching the movie. In many ways, it is much like George C. Scott's portrayal of General Patton... DeNiro simply becomes his character and doesn't let up.<br/><br/>Everything about this movie is amazing. The supporting actors (Pesci, Moriarity, Vincent, etc.) are all superb and give extra layers of humanity to the picture (Pesci's performance here was even better than his in Goodfellas, in my opinion). The black & white photography is rich and interesting. The movie unwinds at a perfect pace and stays interesting throughout. The boxing scenes are true works of art. The power behind each fight is well-represented, and Scorsese does a superb job of showing exactly what is going on in LaMotta's mind every time he fights. Most movies would be happy to have one memorable scene that sticks with the viewer. Raging Bull has more than a dozen.<br/><br/>It's impossible to watch this film without feeling sad at the end. Still, every time I watch it I am in awe of how good it is. It's all too easy to sympathize with the characters (in spite of their flaws), and it's all too easy to be drawn into the storytelling and the uniqueness of the boxing sequences. Martin Scorsese is a master of film, and Raging Bull showcases it perfectly."
"rejoefrankel","10","2","2","6 March 2000"," Quite possibly the best film of the 80's.
","Raging Bull is one of the most shattering dramatic films ever brought to the screen.  Shot in stark black and white, this is Scorsese's masterpiece.  A most unflattering biographical portrait of boxer Jake LaMotta, made that much more shocking knowing that he contributed to the making of the film himself.  Poetic, human, deeply penetrating; Robert DeNiro gives the performance of his career as the Italian from the Bronx with a ferocious temper inside and out of the ring.  There are certain transcendant moments in Raging Bull, where events onscreen overpowered me and ceased to be merely part of a movie.  Sad, unsettling scenes where it is almost embarassing to watch.  As if we as viewers are invading on something too intimate to be exploited.  Masterful filmmaking and a powerhouse script make this one of my TEN BEST FILMS OF ALL TIME."
"er_nest_2000","10","2","2","12 February 2000"," the best film of the 80's
","At first the film made me realize just how violent, domestic violence can be. In a heart stopping scene where Jake (played by De Niro slapped his wife all over the place, Martin Scorsese made me feel that I'm useless, that I could only watch and feel ashamed. Other acts of violence in the film set the entire mood of the film. Anger floats around the whole film and the audience, the unwilling victim. In the end there's a bit of retribution and forgiveness, but it is not clear who would benefit from it. It is a great study of a man's connection with his dark side. Why can't he just walk away from it? Is it a personal choice, or is it really hard to fight it off? One will be transfixed not only by the chaotic scenes and strong dialogue, but also by the most unconventional protagonist I've seen so far in movies released in the 80's: Jake LaMotta. Mr. De Niro's brilliance, may have overshadowed everybody else, but this film is a perfect example of perfect casting, which could be used to the hilt if you have Martin Scorsese at the helm."
"Colonel Ted","10","2","2","11 February 2000"," A compelling study of an unlikeable man
","There are quite a few films that I could mention where the lead characters are wholly unlikeable and because they have no audience appeal, the film suffers greatly. Raging Bull is NOT one of those films. Robert De Nero puts in one of the best performances of his career as middleweight boxer Jake LaMotta. And LaMotta is not a nice chappie at all. Arrogant, rude, abusive, paranoid and obsessive are just some of the more complementary words I can think of to describe him. Yet extraordinarily this enhances rather than detracts from the film. Rather than hating him we feel deeply sorry for him because he was a man who had everything and then lost it through his own selfishness and personal insecurity. Director Scorsese's camera work is brilliant, with the boxing scenes some of the most vivid (not to mention graphic) ever filmed, all impeccably edited by Thelma Schoonmaker. The performances are all superb: Pesci as LaMotta's brother and Moriarty as his wife but especially De Nero as the self-destructive LaMotta himself. Raging Bull is the first Scorsese film that I have seen to date. On this basis I shall be seeing many more."

Her editing stands on its own. I dont think i need to mention DeNiro's performance. It has reached mythic proportions. Believe me its not just the weight. He attacks the role with an amazing power and understanding of this man. cinematography is genius as well. so are the sound effects. The fight scenes are amazing in every aspect. But Scorsese does not rely on them. They are used as a backdrop and they help explore what makes this man tick.

"DanB-4","10","2","2","19 September 1999"," Outstanding!
","Raging Bull is routinely called the best film of the 80's, and many people call it the greatest film of all time. It certainly deserves those accolades and more. It ranks solidly in my all time top ten and is one of the most painful character studies in movie history.<br/><br/>Raging Bull is about a boxer but it is not a boxing movie. In fact, I would be surprised if the fight scenes make up more than 15 minutes of the entire film. They are so brutal and so well done, they seem longer.<br/><br/>Director Martin Scorsese has one of the most impressive C.V.s of any director, and I believe him to be the greatest filmmaker ever. Raging Bull is a work or directorial genius, but the film is primarily Robert DeNiro's triumph. It garnered him a well-deserved 2nd Oscar for this portrayal of a vicious, dislikable near-sociopath with an insane jealous streak and countless personal demons.<br/><br/>In the movies best scene, DeNiro's Jake La Motta takes an absolute pummeling from Sugar Ray Robinson - he appears to be beaten nearly to death. But La Motta is still able to feel victorious, in a smug, insane sort of way as he staggers away, barely able to talk, grins at Robinson and says ""You never knocked me down, Ray."" This scene, for me, sums up the film. You see the best of the directing, editing, acting and special effects, combined with direct insight into La Motta's character. It is truly unforgettable. (This is another editing masterpiece by Thelma Schoonmaker, who also did Goodfellas and most of Scorsese's important work).<br/><br/>Is this Scorsese's best film? IMHO, no, it ranks just behind Goodfellas. But it is still a great film - one of the best ever made.  This is an honest, raw and violent film, not for the faint of heart or seekers of fluffy endings. **** out of ****."

","Raging Bull is what you get when you combine great acting, superb directing, subliminal camera work and editing, and superior writing.  It is hands down the best film ever made.  Frankly, I think it should be rated #1 out of 250! It is clearly the best of Scorsese's films (and he has made MANY great films).  All the actors were superb - Pesci as Joey, Cathy Moriarty as Vickie, Nicholas Colosanto (a.k.a. ""Coach"" from Cheers) as Tommy Como, and even Frank Vincent as Salvy.  And DeNiro - 'nuff said.  I mean, DeNiro is always great, but he was especially awesome in Raging Bull.  Who else would go to such lengths as to purposefully gain 50 lbs.  If I didn't know better, I'd say that DeNiro stole LaMotta's soul.... At any rate, this movie is to die for.  You cannot call yourself a film buff if you haven't seen this movie.  I'd give it six stars (out of five!). Buy it, rent it, steal it, kill for it, do anything to see it!!!"
"Chuck-149","10","2","2","2 September 1999"," THAT was entertainment.
","Through all his incarnations, De Niro has come through 100% each time on. However, he WAS Jake LaMotta in ""Raging bull"".  I mean he absolutely killed himself to play this role.  He went from his usual 150lbs. to to 212lbs. But his performance is was makes this movie so good.  <br/><br/>  Jake LaMotta is a boxer who wants his shot at the title but has never had it.  So after winning about six fights in a row, all fighters are afraid to fight him and so his brother Joey (Joe Pesci) decides to take matters into his own hands and makes a deal behind his brother's back to help him get a shot at the title.  He makes his brother fight an up-and-comer called Janiro.<br/><br/>  After his rather easy victory against Janiro, Jake finally gets a shot at the title which he wins.  But after his fight, he seems to forget everything about his all his work-out and years of hard-work it took him to win the title and begins eating like there's no tomorrow.  He then has problems with his brother and after two other fights, he quits boxing.  We then see what De Niro looks like when he weighs 212lbs.<br/><br/>  All through the movie, De Niro is right on in the role of  LaMotta and took home a very well-deserved Oscar for best actor. But he is supported by a terrific cast including, Joe Pesci as his trainer-brother and Cathy Moriarty as his wife.  It's one of Scorsese's best and has got to be seen by any movie-buff."
"V Hanna","10","2","2","6 August 1999"," Best Fight Scenes Hands Down!!
","There are movies that try to be works of art and then every once in a while there are movies that are art. This movie proves that films are just as important as something hanging on the wall. Scorsese brilliantly captures the life of boxer Jake LaMotta like few people that have been brought to life on screen. Robert DeNiro gives one of the best performances in film history. He plays LaMotta like a concert violinist in front of a sold out audience. DeNiro combined with Joe Pesci as LaMotta's younger brother and trainer Joey are a perfect combination. The cinematography just rips you to shreds and leaves you gasping for air. I never have seen a movie display raw emotion better than Raging Bull. After viewing this movie more than ten times the scenes inside the ring stand out more and more. They make Rocky's fight scenes look like your watching a cartoon. If you watch closely you can truly experience what the fighters are going through. The speed of the jabs, the pounding each fighter takes, the animalistic emotion that they draw upon. Scorsese  includes so many jarring sound and visual effects in the fight scenes that make it so real you can smell the damn thing. And the blood. If this thing was ever colorized it might be the bloodiest movie ever. But it is not over used and misrepresented. It is needed to displayed the true violence that can exist in a boxing ring. Raging Bull is more than just about boxing. It covers spousal jealousy and abuse and it also shows the breakdown that they can cause in a person leading to self destruction. There are so many great shots that it almost becomes ridiculous. One of the best is the one with DeNiro on the ropes in a Christ like image with Sugar Ray Robinson just starring him down ready to crucify DeNiro with his fists. Unbelievable scene. Cathy Moriarty does a great job as LaMotta's wife Vicky and young Frank Vincent has the role as Salvy. Vincent and Pesci really go at it in one scene that leads to a funny shot when they are asked by the local mob boss to make up and be friends. Vincent would go on to be a main stay in most of Scorsese's movies. This movie displays so vividly how LaMotta's violent insides leaked over into his personal life and lead to his destruction. DeNiro rightfully deserved the Academy Award for this role. This is the first time he is asked to gain a large amount of weight as he also did in the 'Untouchables'. And, from reading interviews on how he gains the weight it doesn't sound as easy as you think for someone not used to being in that condition. When an actor is willing to give that much to a role (sorry Stallone you are a little late on this one but I appreciate the effort) you know you have something special. If you haven't seen Raging Bull watch it. You will quickly realize why this was voted the best movie of the eighties."

He attempts to win all the titles he can, fighting all the boxers he can, all the while he battles his own demons, and quarrels with his brother and wife. The scene in the prison cell is one of the most powerful performances by DeNiro I have ever seen.  All the actors are great, and the camera work is flawless.  And the violent scenes rattles your nerves.  The boxing matches are so realistic, it is almost like a documentary. Actually, the whole movie looks like a documentary.  I will even go as far as saying that this film is way more superior than Rocky, and Scorcese should've won best director, and the film should've won best film.  A cinematic masterpiece!"

","Raging Bull is a film that is not easy to watch.  It is brutal, it is honest and it is a completely mesmerizing film.  The boxing scenes alone are enough to make you cringe.  The sights and sounds that Scorsese employs to bring you to the feral level of boxers is amazing.  Sound of wild animals bring you into the brutality of the sport.  The sequence in which Jake beats his opponent so hard that the poor fool just collapses is amazing.  The crowning achievement is the final fight of Jake's career.  When Sugar Ray Robinson raises his arm, Scorsese lets everything fly.  We see Jake stagger against the ropes, we see the blood, we hear the punches, and we see the horror wash across Viki LaMotta's face.  But that's all the boxing scenes, what is at the heart of the film is Jake's relationship with his brother Joey, and Jake's insecurities in life.  He is not the most sympathetic person.  He is violent, suspicious and stubborn.  Through DeNiro's amazing performance we see LaMotta as a complex and tragic figure.  The scene in the Florida jail cell toward the end of the film is powerful.  Jake starts pounding the wall and shouts ""Why?""  In that one scene we see a man finally coming to grips with his life, and his demons."
"A.S.Basi","Null","2","2","3 June 1999"," Incredible
","Engaging, beautifully crafted biography of middle weight boxer Jake LaMotta. The cinematography employs monochrome instead of colour, a great idea because it perfectly mirrors LaMotta's dark persona. LaMotta is depicted here as a confused and paranoid pugilist, the film chronicles his career all the way to the championship belt. DeNiro is so convincing as LaMotta, that I ask myself sometimes if the personality he assumed for Raging Bull was how he must have once been himself. Another amazing thing DeNiro's sheer determination to accurately portray LaMotta in his post-boxing days by adding on fifty pounds! Let's not forget, he trained hard just to achieve the envious physique of LaMotta IN his boxing days! Joe Pesci is perfectly suited to the role of LaMotta's brother and manager, Joey, a quick talking, foul-mouthed but defensive and loyal sibling (and perhaps the only person that is allowed to critcise Jake and get away with it). Cathy Moriarty excels as Vicki LaMotta, Jake's supportive, strong and tolerant wife.<br/><br/>The movie is a classic example of near flawless film-making. Not only is the acting first rate, but the script, cinematography, direction and editing is also of the highest calibre. The screenplay is based on LaMotta's autobiography and of course that gives the dialogue a realistic and true to life feel. Elegant black and white enhances the already brilliant cinematography throughout the film, characterised by picturesque, static camera shots, sharply juxtaposed with the vibrant and kinetic camera work of the fight scenes. The quick, crisp editing to the boxing matches help accentuate the hectic, haphazard ambience of a real duel. Scorsese expertly creates some very tense moments throughout the film, such as the 'You're telling me all these answers Joey, but none of them are the right answer' bit and his use of slow motion at certain moments help convey LaMotta's interpretation of events, such as Vicki giving a normal, everyday goodbye kiss to a departing visitor, a sight that makes Jake immediately think that Vicki may be seeing that person behind his back.<br/><br/>Raging Bull's greatest virtue of all is that it is never boring. Even when watching it again, you'll not come across one boring scene. But than again this only came about because of the sheer talent and skill invested in the acting, direction etc. There are very few films that are first class in all aspects of production. Raging Bull is one of these."

We've all known someone like LaMotta.  A man, who seemingly has all the luck in the world, yet has many demons that he can't fight off, in or out of the ring.<br/><br/>As the film opens, LaMotta is in a marriage that is going nowhere fast and he feels trapped and unhappy.  Upon his introduction to Vicki (executed to perfection by Cathy Moriarty) his look on life changes.  His budding boxing career is beginning to take off, yet out of the ring, as he views his young wife from a distance, she floats in slo-mo and gazes by hungry men don't go unseen by LaMotta.  This only further fuels his jealousy.<br/><br/>The rest of the film is like this, a slow decent into LaMotta's own private hell, and then salvation.<br/><br/>Enough good things can't be said about the richly textured story that Scorsese and his co-writer Paul Schrader created from Jake LaMotta's autobiography of the same title.  The film is dark, hard to watch, and yet still very redeeming.<br/><br/>'For once I was blind and now I can see'<br/><br/>In more ways than one, this passage from the Holy Bible that stands at the end of this film says everything and then nothing.<br/><br/>""Raging Bull"" is the best film I have ever seen."

As it is, Raging Bull must certainly be counted as one of the ten or twenty greatest American films of the century.<br/><br/>The scene where Jake pries the rhinestones from his champion's belt, only to have a pawnbroker tell him that the stones (and now the belt) are worthless, is probably the most depressing scene from any movie I've ever seen."

","Martin Scorsese is on record as saying that he has not yet made a truly great film, something up to the standard of The Searchers, Citizen Kane, Eight and a Half, The Leopard, or The Red Shoes. Perhaps he's right. However, he can boast of at least one film that comes awfully close to that olympian standard, Raging Bull. When Scorsese made Raging Bull, he was seriously thinking of it as a terminal work. He was going to end his career in Hollywood, move to Italy, and make documentaries about the lives of the saints. For better or worse,He chose not to. Still, retirement WAS seriously on his mind, and because of that, Scorsese poured all his thoughts, all his feelings, all of his knowledge of cinema into this, one of the most troubling- and unforgettable films- ever made. I believe that I have seen Raging Bull nearly a dozen times, and I see new meanings and surprising nuances in it every time. Here I can offer only a few comments, both of which are paradoxical. The first is that Raging Bull is a very violent film about love; the second is that it succeeds in portraying Jake Lamotta because it is just as much about Marty Scorsese as it is about Jake LaMotta. There are  five love stories in Raging Bull. The first is the story of Joey Lamottas love for his dull-witted, stubborn, hot-tempered , 'crazy ' brother. The second is Vicky Lamottas equally passionate love for her brutish, insanely jealous husband.The third is the story of Jakes love of himself, which begins as a brutish, jealous, self-loathing, profoundly selfish love, and slowly and in a halting, confused way, becomes a very different self appraisal, the recognition that he is not an ANIMAL, but a man. The Fourth love is that of Marty Scorsese himself, both for the film medium  and for the characters in his best films. The fifth may sound crazy, but I think it is present throughout the film. It is the love of God.It would take a lot more space than I have here, but  I would assert that Raging Bull DOES NOT portray a world in which God is absent; God even loves someone as brutish, as short-sighted, as vulgar and as morally obtuse as Jake. Indeed , Scorsese has even claimed that Jake comes close to God without realizing it. My second claim is that Raging Bull is autobiographical. But, in a sense, almost all of Scorsese's films are, whether directly or indirectly. For me , Raging Bull is autobiographical in that Marty is, to a large extent, reflecting himself in Jake. Scorsese, the ""gangster-priest' is confessing his sins and exorcising his demons. In this way, he is inviting all of his viewers to undertake a similar act of self examination, confession, and exorcism. This is one ( but not the only one) of the reasons that Raging Bull ends with a quote from Johns Gospel and a dedication to Haig Manoogian, who taught Marty how to look into himself and see."
"Pete-17","10","2","2","23 September 1998"," Scorsese's Masterpiece!
","The best movie of the '80's, director Martin Scorsese pulled off what no one else would have attempted: the unsympathetic story of perhaps the most unsympathetic character in all of American cinema, Jake La Motta.  Starring Robert De Niro, ""Raging Bull"" is not a boxing movie in the vein of ""Rocky"".  There is plenty of boxing in it, some of the best boxing scenes ever put onto celluloid, and the movie does follow his rise as a professional boxer.  However, all of that is a backdrop for Jake's real story, his fall as a human being. The closer Jake gets to his goal of winning the Middleweight Championship, the closer he is to destroying his own life.  And once he achieves his goal, all of the energy and passion that went into fighting in the ring he turns to fighting out of the ring and he does just that, destroys his life.  Shot in beautiful Black & White and co-staring Joe Pesci and Cathy Moriarty, ""Raging Bull"" is Martin Scorsese's masterpiece."

After the fight, Scorsese shows a prolonged closeup of Jake's fist in a bucket of ice water. Therefore equating Jakes fist and his penis. Scorsese also cuts from scenes of Jake and his wife (usually romantic in nature) to scenes of him boxing,continually emphasizing that sex and violence are equivalent forms of release to Jake.

"DaveDiggler","10","11","21","11 August 2007"," A Poetic Masterpiece for the Ages
","Martin Scorsese' ""Raging Bull"" stands as one of the greatest films of all time. Its the greatest work of Martin Scorsese' career and Robert De Niro's greatest acting performance. This film stands atop my all time list. Robert De Niro's performance is also the best and most authentic acting performance I have ever seen. What a transformation it is to watch him become middleweight boxer Jake La Matta in this true story of more than just boxing. It's a film of one mans decent into misery and loss. The film will stand the test of time because it's realness and its captivating look is purely mesmerizing, astonishing, and jaw dropping.<br/><br/>Right from the start we are punched in the face as Jake La Matta is eating dinner. The ordinary dinner scene turns into a husband and wife fight like nothing you have ever seen. All over an over cooked stake that isn't ready for eating. Right from the start we see that Jake La Matta is a tormented and troubled man with serious issues ranging from paranoia to insanity to inadequacy to emotional instability to reckless abandon to raging anger. La Matta is a complex character that is brought to us in a riveting performance from one of films all time greats. Throughout the film we see La Matta battle his inner demons as he's always in a 12 round bout with himself. His emotional pain is relentless and his physical pain pails in comparison. He's always trying to prove himself, not to anyone around him, but his own demons and inner pains. His brother Joey (Joe Pesci) tries to manage Jake to a title shot, but that is nearly impossible thanks to Jake's relentless and constant problems that he causes. In a highly memorable ""Hit Me"" scene following the dinner fight; Joey is ordered, then demanded, to punch his brother in the face by Jake himself. Joey after some talking into, starts beating on Jakes face until his cuts- from his previous fight- start to bleed and crack open. What is the purpose Joey asks. Jake responds with a smile and a playful pinch on the cheek. Right from the start we see that Jake has no purpose. All he has is pain. It would hurt too much to stop it so he takes it.<br/><br/>As Jake climbs up the boxing ranks his tormented life and his inner demons start to take a toll on not only him but everyone around him. His life style mirrors his fighting style. Jake La Matta' fighting style is just like his personality. There's no technique or any strategy given to him by his corner. He uses outside forces to take out his opponent inside the ring and the inside forces take out the people outside the ring that he loves. He is relationship impaired and knows of no way to deal with women(or with anybody for that matter).<br/><br/>Some of Scorsese' greatest moments come during the boxing scenes. We hear the cringing cat cries and exploding light bulbs and we feel the brutality even though we may not even understand what we're hearing. In a fight with the ""good-looking"" Janrio, Jake is a large imposing animal taking out all his frustrations on the face of Janrio. He makes him ugly and pierces a hole right through his wife (Cathy Moriarty) who called Janiro ""good-looking."" Then as his career starts to unfold due to his misery and paranoia. He looses the belt, then he looses himself.<br/><br/>After Jake retires from boxing a weight has been lifted off his shoulders- but physically a weight has been added. Now he doesn't have any responsibilities and he no longer has to worry about his weight, which fluctuates in the film and by films end; De Niro gains 60 pounds. Without any worries or responsibilities, La Matta is still incapable of being happy. He looses everything that he has ever fought for and in a brutally emotional scene at the end of the film where La Matta finds himself in jail; we actually sympathize for his character. We wish he did right, but he never does. Something appeals to us, maybe we see some good in him even though it never shows through. Maybe we want some good in him because it never shows through. Maybe we see how troubled he is and we just want to see some happiness in his life. The dark scene is shot in perfection and Jake takes his past regrets out on his jail cell's cement wall. Jake lets out a fury of punches and head butts, but not even this bull has a punchers chance in hell. After his cries of ""Why! Why! Why!"" go unanswered. All he has is his 10X10 Miami jail cell to sit and stew in. Completely in the dark, Scorsese' final touches bring us into the cell as Jake breaks down emotionally. We see no remorse as he doesn't see himself as the bad guy that everyone says he is. He believes he's just a troubled man not wanting to hurt anyone. The worst part of it all is: He doesn't think he has hurt anyone; when all we see is that's all he's ever done- is hurt the ones he loves. There are no apologies. He has no acknowledgment of anything he's ever done being wrong, which is truly heartbreaking, because it looks as though he will never change. A brutally honest portrait of an animal. <br/><br/>10/10"

","With it's immaculate attention to detail and De Niro's oh so intense performance this film is as arid as any i've ever seen. Everything is rammed home at home at such a level as to drain any interest or life from proceedings. With Mean Streets and Taxi Driver Scorsese had shown an unparralled ability to capture a palpable feeling of contemporary New York. Since then his retreat into making what are in effect period films has been accompanied by overwhelming "" authenticity "" rivalled only by Merchant-Ivory. This film lacks pacing, humour and any feel of life lived.<br/><br/>One of the most overrated movies ever."

","During World War II, when death and destruction are rampart, a different kind of war rages inside the mind of an American boxer. Jake LaMotta, perhaps more comfortable inside the ring than outside, has personal demons to battle. For his nature is one of insecurity and jealousy and self-destructiveness. It is by rage, and by rage alone, that drives the great fighter. Look at his ring rejoinder after his second wife Vickie states that a particular fighter (Tony Janiro) is ""good-looking."" Wham! There was another, external quandary: the rackets. They controlled who fought whom. And boxing decisions are often problematic. In Raging Bull's first fight scene, we see the undefeated Jake LaMotta crushing Jimmy Reeves in the ring but not getting the decision, apparently because of a fix (1941). In a subsequent fight he would knock out Reeves (1943). Nevertheless Jake LaMotta had to relax his own ring ""moral"" standards (!) and play ball with the mob as urged by his brother. Only after he throws a fight to Billy Fox in 1947 (TKO in the 4th) and paid some cash, was he given a shot at the Middleweight title. He made the most of it when he defeated Marcel Cerdan (1949). But then again, a new problem arose: Would he have the hunger to maintain the belt? By the way, LaMotta's career did not end with his last loss to Sugar Ray Robinson (1951), as he had ten more fights. When he did retire in 1954, he had lost his title, wives, and money, although he had his jokes (and there would be more wives). It was his stand up comedy routine which later sustained him.<br/><br/>While Raging Bulls' boxing scenes are brutal enough, look at LaMotta's deep-rooted internal turbulence when he deals with members of his own family. The man's conflict continues long after his retirement. For one thing, his words and persona remain pugnacious. To LaMotta, women always seem to be either nuns or whores, and there was little middle ground for an equal marriage partner. Thus there is domestic violence. Then we see LaMotta morph from a tough lean and mean boxer to an overweight joker, still missing a few principles (DeNiro actually gained 60 pounds for the role). What is amazing is that LaMotta is alive and well in his 90th year as of this writing. Maybe he has finally outlived his old demons. One tough dude indeed! <br/><br/>Director Martin Scorsese has brilliantly captured the flavor of living in the teeming tenements of New York. Note how wonderfully he pays attention to detail and sets the 1940s mood. There is the grittiness, the noir, the black and white feel of the period. Inside the apartment we hear the external sounds of crying children and automobile horns. For it is a noisy and crowded and hot city that emanates through open apartment windows that lack modern air-conditioning. In the ring we bear witness not only to the precise choreography (including the sound effects) of the fight scenes – the sweat and blood of it all – but also to the claustrophobic nature of the ring itself.<br/><br/>Besides the lead, the casting is splendid all around. To mention a few, Joe Pesci is Jake's mentor brother, Joey LaMotta, who managed and organized his bouts. Cathy Moriarty is convincing as a sensual Vicki, LaMotta's second wife. Nicholas Colasanto and Frank Vincent are appropriate as mob bosses. Robert DeNiro as Jake La Motta deservedly won the Academy Award for Best Actor. Scorsese was robbed of the Academy Award for Best Picture, no question about it. Does anyone really think that Ordinary People was better? Total Film Magazine named Scorsese the second greatest director of all time, ahead of Steven Spielberg and behind the master, Alfred Hitchcock. But it took years for Scorsese to win the Academy Award for Best Picture (2006). See Raging Bull, which is now number 4 (!) on AFI's Top 100 all-time movie listing (2007). Where does Ordinary People rank?"

","De Niro got heaps of praise for his performance in Raging Bull.  I'll admit it is gutsy.   But so what.   He gained weight, he lost weight.  He acted like a total slimeball.   So what?   The movie fails completely to explain why anyone would care about Jake LaMotta.   Indeed, nothing about DeNiro's character is attractive.   He fails to show any redeeming qualities in LaMotta, which ultimately makes the movie unbelievable.   The supporting performances, especially from Joe Pesci and Cathy Moriarty are far greater. The fight scenes are a marvel, as is the cinematography and editing.  The core, however, is rotten."
"rmax304823","7","9","17","29 January 2007"," Atypical Sports Story
","The usual trajectory in a sports movie involves some underprivileged character discovering he has a talent, being put through a rigorous training by a mentor, riding that talent to national prominence, being undone by personal demons, and finally rediscovering himself. ""Rocky"" didn't fit the formula and neither does ""Raging Bull."" ""Rocky,"" I suspect, broke the mold not so much in the course of a search for originality but in order to leave the way open for a sequel. Or, as it turns out, about five or six sequels. But ""Raging Bull"" dispenses entirely with the formula and follows Jake LaMotta from early in his career to his ultimate degradation as an unfunny host at a seedy bar in New York. And that's it, except for the possibility of a reconciliation between him and his estranged brother, left unresolved.<br/><br/>Scorcese's direction is simply fine. It's identifiably his own, of course, with inserts of home movies, fist fights over girls, an edgy semi-improvisational quality in the delivery of dialog, slow motion punches to the mouth, a musical score that leans heavily on Italian opera and contemporary pop songs. The plot, for whatever reason, doesn't integrate too well its chief themes -- LaMotta's obsession with his wife's fidelity and his career in the ring. You could almost eliminate one of the plot strings and have enough left over for an independent feature. But that's a minor carp in the overall context because the overwhelming presence of Robert DeNiro as Jake LaMotta pretty much manages to pull them together so the seams are not noticeable.<br/><br/>So the movie depends on DeNiro's performance -- and does he deliver! In real life DeNiro is a sensitive, thoughtful, and private guy, but he does a superb job of dumbing his character down and making him sympathetic and ugly at the same time. Let's say that his LaMotta doesn't show a great deal of insight, whether running around in a paranoid frenzy or pounding an enemy into pulp in the ring. And he has one scene that equals anything he's put on the screen before. A down-and-outer, arrested for serving minors in his cheap night club, and thrown in jail because he is unable to raise a few thousand dollars for bail, he repeatedly smashes his fists against the wall and pounds his forehead on the cement, all the while ululating like a wounded animal. What a performance.<br/><br/>He's well supported by Joe Pesci as the brother who is no more insightful but at least has a hold on common sense. Cathy Moriarty is adequate as LaMotta's abused wife.<br/><br/>I'm driven to add something completely irrelevant to an assessment of the film. When it first came out, I was part of a seminar in the Psychiatry Department at the University of Connecticut and we were dealing with delirium, derived from Latin ""de liro"" -- ""I rave."" I desperately wanted to somehow sneak into the discussions a play on words involving the title of the film -- ""Raving Bull"" staring Robert DeLiro. I never found a way of bringing it up without appearing nuts. Now I've got it out of my system, thanks to IMDb.com, after a quarter of a century. Pardon me. (Wiping away tears of relief and gratitude.) I'd like to thank you all for reading this. I owe everything I have to my coach (thanks, Butch) and my Mom and Dad. (Sob.) Much of the credit goes to my cat, Josefina, and to my Mousterian ancestors. (Breaking into a lachrymose cascade.) <br/><br/>This is a violent and sometimes bloody movie. Scorcese spares us nothing in the way of physical or emotional brutality. But it really shouldn't be missed. A good job on the part of everyone concerned."

","Watching the slow disintegration of a man who's not particularly likable in the first place - what's the point? That the film contains brilliant direction, photography, acting, music, etc. (and it does) doesn't really provide an excuse. With nothing at the core, Raging Bull is just an empty experience. I mean, come on - a boxer who's a violent personality, whoa! What a dramatic surprise that is. Two hours of this stuff is definitely overkill - but even at ninety minutes this would be too long. Hell, even at TEN minutes."
"ironhorse_iv","9","5","8","13 March 2016"," Rage on! Raging Bull is a masterpiece. A very unique and entertaining watch.
","After finishing reading boxer, Jake LaMotta's memoir, 'Raging Bull: My Story"", I have to say the movie adaptation of this emotionally story of a self-destructive boxer, Jake LaMotta's (Robert De Niro) journey through life, as the violence and temper that leads him to the top in the ring, and but also hurt his private life outside it, is a brilliant black and white bio-pic. It's crude, harsh, and shocking – with its use of violence and adult-driven profanity though not as shocking as in an earlier draft of the screenplay by screenwriters, Paul Schrader & Mardik Martin, which show a lot more of Jake's bad side. Some good examples are when Jake is seen kicking and punching, a pregnant woman. Another one, not explained in the film, is the fact that La Motta had been a petty criminal, during his teen years, and he only learned boxing while in reform school. During much of his boxing career, Jake often feared that the law enforcement would be found out that he killed a local bookie during a failed robbery attempt, and he believed that he would ""pay for"" what he did, one way or another. La Motta would later, find out later in his boxing career, he had badly hurt the bookie, but didn't killed him. Nevertheless, I think the part of his story would had made the film, so much better. Despite that, most of the film changes does work, such as La Motta's fights, removal of La Motta's father, and the reduction of organized crime's role in the story. One of the better changes, was the merger of the characters of La Motta's friend, Pete Savage with that of his brother, Joey La Motta (Joe Pesci). Directed by Martin Scorsese, the movie is also well-shot. I love the use of slow moment in the black and white principal photography. I like how each of the boxing scenes was choreographed for a specific visual style. The fight scenes are very impressionistic. Even the color scenes were fine. I love how La Motta's color family home movies, really look real & personally. Just the fact, that these sequences were personally scraped by Martin Scorsese with a coat-hanger to ensure a rough, naturalistic feeling, made the film, so much better. I love how Scorsese seems to have lifted the film's distinctive look and feel directly from La Motta's autobiography. However, I glad Martin didn't follow with La Motta's style in which this movie was to be played for him. After all, La Motta's idea of jerky movements, with huge gaps. A string of poorly lit sequences, some of them with no beginning and some with no end with no musical score would be a little too unwatchable. Instead, the movie is well-paced, well shot, and has tons of beautiful classical music from 19th century, composer Pietro Mascagni and 1940/1950s jukebox. In my opinion, I think, it's one of Martin Scorsese's greatest movies. It's surprising to hear today, that this movie was almost the director's last movie. After nearly dying from a drug overdose in the 1970s, Scorsese agreed to make the film for Robert De Niro's sake. Not only did, this movie save Martin's own life but also to save what remained of his career. It really did redeem the director's life. Talking about career changing. This film almost made Robert De Niro into a bigger star. Preparation for his boxing role, Robert De Niro went through extensive physical training, then entered in three genuine Brooklyn boxing matches, just show how well-trained, he got. Surprising, De Niro won two of the bouts. If that wasn't enough, Robert De Niro is infamous for this film, for gained a record 60 pounds to play the older Jake LaMotta. What a remarkable performance from him. Even supporting actors like Joe Pesci did well. This was a breakout role for Pesci, a singer, comedian, and former child-actor. He had been in only one film before this, and nearly decided to quit acting before he was asked to play Joey. It pretty much, save Joe Pesci's career. Overall: Raging Bull had cemented its reputation as a modern classic, both with the critics and with general audiences. The use of gorgeous black-and-white photography mixed with great acting continue to evoke viewers even today's world. It's a must-watch for anybody who loves movies."

","A recurring theme in Martin Scorsese's filmography is the clash between professional and private life. In both Goodfellas and Casino, the protagonist's family is eroded by the same criminal connections which initially helped forming it. In Taxi Driver, Travis Bickle's psychosis is fueled by his nocturnal contact with the city's seedy underbelly. The paramedic in Bringing Out the Dead experiences burn-out. In The Departed, the main characters are both undercover, mirroring each other in their daily deception. Shutter Island features a neat subversion, which I won't spoil as it's the movie's main twist.<br/><br/>This biopic of boxer Jake La Motta (De Niro) may be Scorsese's best execution of this theme. La Motta's ferocity propels him to championship, but takes a toll on his life ruining his relationships with his brother (Pesci) and wives - domestic and professional violence appear to feed each other in a terrifying, self-destructive spiral.<br/><br/>Raging Bull is technically exceptional, with stylish black and white cinematography, perfect editing, masterful use of sound.

","""Raging Bull"" is routinely named one of the greatest films of all time. ""Scorsese was robbed! This is his best film! This should've been Best Picture of 1980!"" are the typical battle cries. Watching the film now, it emerges as one of those films I respect wholeheartedly as a Scorsese fan, and more importantly, as a film buff. It's not on my favorite films of all time list, and as far as Scorsese goes, I enjoyed ""Goodfellas"" and ""The Departed"" far more. Still, it is an uncompromising example of film as art.<br/><br/>First, we have the usually bombastic Scorsese, beautifully subdued here from the classical music to the graceful camera movements to the haunting black and white photography. Second, we have Robert DeNiro as boxer Jake LaMotta giving the performance of his career that rightfully won him the Oscar. Thirdly we have all that we come to expect from a Scorsese film: iconic shots (like the pan to the blood dripping from the ropes), quotable dialog (""I've heard things. I've heard things""), and his rich archetypes (DeNiro and Pesci in their love/hate relationship as brothers, and a raspy and sassy Cathy Moriarity in the objectified wife-as-whore role). The fight scenes are the most artistically satisfying of any boxing film that has come before or since.<br/><br/>Finally, it contains something only in which a rabid movie buff can find joy. It contains the link between two of my favorite directors: Martin Scorsese and David Lynch. As Joe Pesci watches one of the fights on TV, Pabst Blue Ribbon appears as the corporate sponsor. Later, in a scene where DeNiro is being interviewed at his Florida home, a Tony Bennet version of ""Blue Velvet"" can be heard playing in the background. The movie gods shined down on us six years later when David Lynch made his classic thriller ""Blue Velvet,"" which, in no small coincidence, featured prominently, Pabst Blue Ribbon as the favorite drink of Dennis Hopper's psychotic Frank Booth."

Raging Bull is the life story of Jake LaMotta, a winner inside the ring and a loser outside of it. Here is a man that had it all. LaMotta was a talented boxer that had money, a beautiful wife, a loyal brother and eventually threw it all away because of his paranoia, jealousy, insecurity and self-loathing. The cast is outstanding. De Niro's portrayal of Jake LaMotta is one of the all time great performances. I do not know of any other actor that gave a more emotionally intense and physically demanding performance. The jail scene where LaMotta has hit rock bottom, is hard to get out of your head. The boxing scenes are brutal and expertly shot and the black and white cinematography is exquisite. This film is not simply a contender, it's one of the all time great champions."

","I'm no boxing fan so I can't honestly say that I was dying to see this movie until I learned that Scorsese himself is not a boxing fan but he wanted to tell this story so this intrigued me even more and after always hearing about the massive praise for Robert De Niro performance I have to say I was very impressed. I'm gonna start out by saying the cliché thing when talking about this movie, Robert De Niro is absolutely incredible in this film it's in my opinion the greatest performance he's ever given, through De Niros performance when see La Motta gradually becoming his title of being a ""Raging Bull"" and was a truly terrifying presence. The boxing scenes in this film are so real, Scorsese did such a good job directed this film he put you right in their to the point where you could feel the power of every punch and move made. Joe Pesci was so fantastic in this film he seemed like a real scumbag but was never over the top at his chemistry with De Niro was completely on point. La Mottas character arc was handled perfectly, you understood just how much of his humanity he was losing both physically and mentally to the point where you actually start to pity him while still fearing him at certain points. Now one of the most common things to find in a Scorsese film is a female love interest that comes to hate the protagonist and this film has this but works for this film as it added to character arc of La Motta and gave room for Cathy Moriarty to give such a great and damaged performance in this film. However if I am completely honest I don't quite like this film as much as everyone else does, I do have one of two minor issues with this film for one, I didn't think making this film Black and White really added anything to this film and at times was just distracting and I think that the portion of the film that focuses LaMottas success in the ring is to short, the film montages over his major successes and does subtract some What from the intensity of the final fight. However I do think that the last act of this film was very effective as it got away from the boxing and focused on the characters aftermath of his time in the ring and we go from despising LaMotta to as I said sympathising with him and I truly thought that De Niro pulled it of perfectly. <br/><br/>Raging Bull is a fantastic film, I don't quite think it's a masterpiece but it's got an incredible Robert De Niro performance, really intense and personal boxing matches and a perfect way of giving insight into its title character and giving him a complexity that makes him a better character. <br/><br/>86%/A-"

"villani","Null","3","4","1 April 2002"," A symbolic masterpiece
","Though Raging Bull was based on a real-life story, like a true auteur, Scorsese shaped this film and made it his own through symbolism. The title signifies an uncontrollable rage inside the ring, which spills over into LaMotta's personal life, alienating those closest to him. The boxing arena only serves as a background for in-depth character development. The real engine that drives the movie is his jealous obsession with his wife, and fear of her sexuality. The use of fog, fluids, and LaMotta's refusal to fall in the ring expose his character, and his ultimate downfall.<br/><br/>Scorsese introduces the fog motif in the very first shot of the film. The viewer has an objective perspective of the fog that surrounds LaMotta in his career and in his mind. When LaMotta is in the ring, the crowds are obliterated, and the only sign of them is when flashbulbs go off. When he is in the sauna sweating off the necessary four pounds, he is again surrounded by fog. The fog associated with his boxing career symbolically and visually establishes LaMotta as a very isolated individual, who does not have a grasp on reality or relate to people well. He leads an egocentric life based on his own thoughts and suspicions. His judgment becomes clouded by his paranoid fears that his wife is sleeping with other men, until he eventually believes that his brother has slept with her. In the last fight scene when he loses his middleweight title, the crowd is no longer clouded. When the judges and his wife are splattered with LaMotta's blood, the camera is in very sharp focus. This scene is followed very quickly with LaMotta's retirement as an overweight loser, the loss of his wife and children and his jail time. The fog has similarly cleared in his mind as he realizes his mistakes. He screams, `Why? Why? Why?' in his jail cell, and later apologizes to his brother, admitting that he was a bum. Scorsese links the end if the film to the beginning as LaMotta smokes a cigar and self-induced fog covers his face. He knows his downfall was his own doing.<br/><br/>The use of fluids also links LaMotta's experience in the boxing ring to his fear of his wife's sexuality. Close ups of sweat pouring off his face emphasizes physical exertions as a substitute for sexual relations, as Vickie constantly complains that he is too busy fighting to have sex with her. The first time he sees Vickie in the pool, she is linked to a large body of pure water. After their first sexual encounter, he calms himself down with ice water. Gradually, the fluid symbol begins to transform. After he loses his first fight with Sugar Ray, the water in the bucket, with a close up of his fist, signifies his increasing anger and rage. About that time, he starts to suspect Vickie of having sex with other men. The water squeezed on him in between rounds no longer purifies him physically or symbolically, because he is becoming mentally disturbed. The water sponged on him in his last fight with Sugar Ray, at the beginning of his decline, is red from blood. He is tainted by his obsession, as is his wife when she is sprayed with his blood. Scorsese again links the elder LaMotta with his youthful boxing self by having him drink water before he goes out to recite. He is symbolically pure now that he knows his past mistakes.<br/><br/>To LaMotta, the true sign of a man is his ability to remain standing. Scorsese consistently shows weakness lying or sitting down, and strength, power and control standing up. LaMotta stands to have his brother Joey punch him in the face. He refuses to fall when the mob tells him he has to take a fall. He knocks Sugar Ray down twice, and prides himself even after he loses the middleweight crown that Ray never knocked him down. However, while he sits in between the rounds, his brother/manager yells at him. When he sits down after the lost match with Sugar Ray, he cries, showing his weakness. He is sitting when he hangs up the phone on his brother without apologizing, and when he is in the jail cell at the time of his ultimate downfall, having lost his title and his belt in order to post bail. This pattern of domination and control only while standing extends outside of the ring to LaMotta's relationship with Vickie. He stands behind his wife, pulling her hair or slapping her. He dominates her with violence the way he would in the ring, but he is powerless on his back or sitting, demonstrating his fear of sexuality. He has to stand up to regain some control after their first encounter laying on his back, saying `What are you doing to me?' He knows that she has the real control. The first time LaMotta sees Vickie, she towers over him on the other side of the fence. She dwarfs him sitting on his lap. Scorsese shoots her going up stairs or in extreme close ups and LaMotta farther away so he seems smaller than she does. Since he feels so inferior, he resorts to violence to feel that he has control over her. Because he refused to fall in the ring, LaMotta was bound to fall outside of the ring. Fall he did, and he became a sad, pathetic, broke, lonely, overweight man."

","One of my alltime favorite films, Raging Bull is a stunning examination of brutality and one man's descent into decadence and immorality. Much more than a boxing film, it's a documentation of what makes us human, and the potential of it's destruction. Simply put, Robert DeNiro gives the performance of a lifetime. He is absolutely magnificent as Jake LaMotta, a true bull of a man in and out of the ring. His sheer presence is overpowering, but he is competently underscored by an impressive supporting cast, especially Pesci as his tormented brother and Moriarty as his abused wife. The boxing sequences are as real as it gets, unflinchingly brutal and almost poignant. Behind all the ugliness of Raging Bull, though, lies beauty. The actions of LaMotta hardly evoke pity, but the film is so poetic and incredibly filmed that the movie is never so stark and perverse as to be unwatchable. Bringing it all together is the masterful direction of Martin Scorsese, who is brilliant as always. I could talk forever about Raging Bull, but it has to be viewed to be fully appreciated. For that matter, see it more than once, it gets better with each viewing."

","Raging Bull is hands-down my favorite movie of 1980. It is also the best boxing movie ever made, and it is a movie that will forever be remembered by American audiences. Martin Scorsese's film tells the true story of the unhinged boxer, Jake LaMotta (who passed away last year at the ripe old age of 95). He was a boxer who punched hard, harder, and hardest, and he went all out in the boxing ring. Outside of the ring, he was a vulnerable man especially when it came to women. He believed women to be precious virgins for his own making, and only he can take away their virginity. The movie really went deep with his character, and I love how the movie is not afraid to throw punches. <br/><br/>This was Martin Scorsese's big passion project. After the disappointment of his 1977 feature, New York, New York, he fell into a state of depression and that triggered his drug use which almost killed him. Fortunately, this movie took him away from those dark times. He was reluctant to make this movie at first because he does not like sports. With the help of Robert De Niro, Scorsese was convinced to make the movie. He made it clear that this was his movie and he was going to make it his way. We are glad he did, because this movie ended up being an all-time great that will forever be studied in film school. <br/><br/>Jake LaMotta (Robert De Niro) is a boxer known for obliterating his opponents in the boxing ring. Outside of the boxing ring, he treats his family and friends like garbage. He is a ticking time bomb, ready to destroy the people who love him. What could be the reasons? Is it because he is constantly jealous or paranoid? Is it because his women are cheating on him? Paul Schrader and Mardik Martin brings the true story of this very violent man to life with their hard-hitting screenplay. <br/><br/>In addition to Scorsese, this is Robert De Niro's movie. In a career spanning nearly half a century, this is his role you will remember him by. His convincing portrayal of Jake LaMotta is one of the best acting performances ever, and it earned him the Academy Award for Best Actor. I also loved his commitment to the role. He famously stopped production for several months so he can go on a binge-eating tour of Europe to increase his weight necessary for the role. Joe Pesci who played LaMotta's brother Joey was also great. Pesci actually gave up on acting prior to this role, but De Niro convinced him to play this role. I am glad because this also ranks as Pesci's finest performance to date. <br/><br/>Another component I value about the movie is the look and the editing process of the film. The film is made in black and white and it adds realism to the movie. Scorsese also changed the way boxing movies were made. He was the first director to film the fight scenes inside the ring. That allowed us to see the emotions of the fighters. It also gave us a very brutal, unflinching view of the fights. Scorsese isn't afraid to show blood. Thelma Schoonmaker's editing ranks at one of the all-time's best. You won't find a better-edited film anywhere else. <br/><br/>Raging Bull is one of those films that you will dissect in film school. There are layers upon layers to the film, and one could spend years trying to understand it. As much as I enjoy watching Ordinary People and its theme of PTSD, this is the film that ultimately should have won best picture. Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro crafted one of those rare films that could be defined as perfect. <br/><br/>My Grade: A+"

Fairly lame.<br/><br/>And the film's ambivalent relationship to the main character doesn't seem fleshed out enough to be intentional. So, are we supposed to care about this guy or is he a monster?<br/><br/>Glorifying violence one moment and making it seem monstrous the next.<br/><br/>Besides, if anyone has ever watched one DeNiro and/or Joe Pesci performance, they've seen it already.<br/><br/>Again, other than the fact that it looks amazing and flows incredibly well....there ain't much here."

But calling this mess a masterpiece is cheapening the word in every sense.<br/><br/>As with many Scorsese films the subject matter is extremely interesting, but in no time at all turns into a tiring bore. Good Lord, how many times must we be forced to watch a long drawn-out scene with De Niro's character screaming, yelling and slapping his wife around to realize he's not very trusting and has a shaky home life?

Now I know that De Niro pulls off a fantastic La Motta, and there is no doubting Scorcese's directorial excellence, but this film just failed to engage me. It crawls along with a premise of some kind of story, but just bores.

"johno1100","10","6","11","16 March 2008"," Gritty yet still maintains beautiful artistic illustration (Like most of Scorsese's movies in that period)
","The partnership between revolutionary director Martin Scorsese and iconic actor Robert De Niro which spanned for about 20/25 years will forever be remembered by critics and fans as one of the greatest periods for cinematic achievement. A time were both of these legends peaked in their careers. Of course there were other actors involved (Joe Pesci, Frank Vincent, etc) But the two constants of these movies were Scorsese and De Niro. They are credited with making some of the greatest movies of all time IE; Taxi driver, Raging bull, Goodfellas and Casino just to name a few. These movies have received marvellous critical acclaim and continue to be loved even after 30 after some of them were made. They gave us a look at a world most of us had never seen, the underworld of society. They made us feel for characters we wouldn't usually associate with. And they set a standard for their type of movie which hasn't yet been conquered. But as much as I could talk all day about how these two geniuses revolutionised cinema the main concentration of this review will be based on the 1980 movie raging bull. To an outsider given only a vague idea to the story of Raging bull it is just another boxing movie. But if we look deeper into the surface we find that it is much more. It is more than just another rocky movie, it's not about a brain dead boxer who tries hard and wins it has much more deaph than that. The movie tells the story of an emotionally self destructive boxers rise (ish) And fall. It is a study of a man (Jake La Motta played by De Niro) who keeps knocking himself down everywhere he goes in life. A man who we learn more and more about throughout the course of the movie. We see he abuses the women in his life he sees them as slaves not human beings. We see throughout the course of the movie that he ends up despising himself. We see that he will be willing to change himself just for the sake of masculinity something which most men can relate to. The boxing ring is nothing more than a symbolic parallel to his life outside it. it's almost as if he is punishing himself for what he has done in his life. La Motta ends up in a state were he doesn't demand pity but the audience feels sorry for him anyway. Although La Motta is a scumbag we are still interested and relating with the character throughout the 2 hour long movie. Scorsese makes Raging bull a lot more classical with the use of classical music throughout the films gritty tale it gives us a feel of beauty beneath the surface of this man tough guy exterior.<br/><br/>The film won Robert De Niro a best actor in a leading role Oscar although Scorsese's fully deserving best director Oscar went to Robert Redford."
"freemantle_uk","10","6","11","15 March 2008"," Scorsese and De Niro at their best
","Contains Spoiler!<br/><br/>Raging Bull is my favourite Scorsese films and one of favourite films generally. The film follows the story of Jake LaMotta, a famous middle-weight boxing in the 1940s. In my opinion I believe the film is about the destruction of a person's character and how misleading the American Dream can be. In the film you see LaMotta as a successful boxer, but also a violent and abusive character. He was abusive to his first wife and ended up starting a relationship with a 15-year-old girl, Vicky. He had a loving relationship with her and ends up getting married but as the film progressives you see they relationship disintegrate. You see the same happen between Jake and his brother Joey who was also Jake's manager. LaMotta does make it to the top, becoming the world-champion and becoming well-off. However, after his career was over he moved to Florida, owned a nightclub before getting arrested. After he was released he ended up being a has-been performer.<br/><br/>The direction by Scorsese is some of his best. He does some very good shots, the boxing scene are fantastic with the feeling that it was real. Filming the film in black and white also was an excellent move by the director. The performers were also top-draw. De Niro was perfect as Jake LaMotta, and he performed brilliantly with Joe Pesci and Cathy Moriarty. De Niro deserves to his Oscar for this film, and Pesci and Moriarty would have been up their. I also felt that this should have been the film Scorsese should have won his Oscar with."
"smoothiedudie","10","6","11","21 February 2008"," The Greatest Movie Ever Made
","Few sites in cinema are as poetic as the opening shot of Martin Scorcese's dramatic masterpiece. The slowness and grace of Jake La Motta preparing himself for the fight is an excellent juxtaposition for the rest of the movie. It's the calm before the storm. It's Scorcese's way of putting us in a false sense of security, and it works perfectly.<br/><br/>However, this is just one of many great things about Raging Bull. The editing, cinematography, art direction and sound all excel like in no other movie. Robert De Niro's career best performance as the tortured boxer stands as one of the best ever committed to film, the script is brutal and realistic, and the direction is unbelievably good. Few films have the same impact on an audience as that as Raging Bull. It could be because Scorcese directs it in such a way that we all respond to it emotionally, but it's more likely that for all that Jake does wrong to his family, we sympathise with him, because we all want to be forgiven for the things we've done wrong.<br/><br/>I think this film is perfect in every way a movie needs to be. It's a masterpiece, a work of art. It's films like this which change the way a person looks at the world"
"Pedro_H","8","6","11","18 April 2003"," Boxing B picture gets a big budget makeover.
","Bio pic of controversial and troubled boxer Jake La Motta.<br/><br/>Hard to say quite why a La Motta bio-pic should be the ""pet"" project of Martin Scorsese (director) and Robert De Niro (lead), but clearly it was, so a great deal of time and effort was spent over a character the world had not only forgotten about, but only the most ardent sports fans knew about in the first place!<br/><br/>While La Motta was clearly a world class boxer (even middleweight World Champion for a short while), he was hardly one of the all-time greats and had a fighting style that involved more bravery than skill. His habit of walking through a jab was almost a lesson in how ""not"" to box!<br/><br/>Out of the ring his habit of articulating emotion with his fists, rather than his mouth, was well known, but here he is turned in to a fully formed psychopath to accommodate De Niro's acting abilities. <br/><br/>Certainly the young La Motta was a wild criminal and occasional mugger (something that the film makes no reference to - despite being mentioned in his autobiography, the inspiration for this film), but it is hard to believe what we see on film.<br/><br/>The film was conceived and written for De Niro to go clean over-the-top and for people that don't know any better to mistake it for great acting.<br/><br/>(In this he was successful - as he won the Best Actor Oscar.)<br/><br/>De Niro got himself fit and then got himself fat for this film, but so what? Anyone can box for short takes on film, it is boxing for 15 rounds with only 30 second breaks that the public can't do. As regards getting fat for the later scenes - so what again? Has anyone else ever got praise for eating two dinners a day in France?<br/><br/>The strange thing about this picture is how much it is like those old B pictures. Not only are we mostly in B&W (colour for a single home movie), but also spend extended periods in medium shot. The fights are announced in subtitles, and then we are in to the boxing clichés that involve point-of-view, the blood, the slow-motion, the ringside cigars, the flashbulbs. Scorsese seems to think that we don't know that boxing is legalised violence and need it pointing out to us then underlined for good measure. <br/><br/>The strange thing is that La Motta wasn't (and isn't) a dullard or a patsie, but quite a canny guy who later worked as a second rate comedian (shown in the film) and even after dinner speaker, but here he appears a bit slow, tongue tied and withdrawn. To this day (at 80 plus) he is a machine gun of wisecracks and mini-jokes, yet is portrayed here as a sullen introvert. I can't marry the two images.<br/><br/>(Given his involvement in the film and having read the script I cannot see why he would sanction this. Maybe he thought the film was just a piece of passing nonsense and objected - even to the point of talking about legal action - when he realised that this gave him a false image?)<br/><br/>It is interesting to note that the scene where De Niro attacks his brother-in-law (in a fit of paranoia) was not rehearsed. Pesci was not told what was going to happen and the surprise on his face is real, not acting!<br/><br/>The film effects people because violence is very cinematic and despite all the disclaimers most of us enjoy short bursts of it. The dialogue (by Paul Schrader and Mardik Martin) is good and truthful, but drags after a while. The characters expose their limits early and have only to play them out for the rest of the time.<br/><br/>Having seemed doubting and questioning it may surprise you that I like the picture and recommend it. It is very compulsive and has something that you can't put your finger on. Despite being violent and sometimes unpleasant you can't help routing for the guy and hope he can find happiness somehow.<br/><br/>Maybe this is because I take my hat of to all boxers, they have bravery, dedication and courage that even twenty million dollar a picture actors envy and want to wear the clothes of."

These people were a bunch of morally bankrupt lowlifes! And I sincerely doubt that anyone used the F-word in the 1940s as much as was featured in this film. What is it about so many movie makers that makes them think inclusion of the F-word somehow improves it? (just like so many standup comics of today) And the whole B&W thing! Just because color film is the norm doesn't mean making a movie in B&W somehow moves it out of the ""movie"" category and into the ""film"" category.

","Raging Bull is a story about the dark, gritty, lonely side of the 1940s & 50s boxing phenomenon as shown through the eyes of the champ Jake La Matta (Robert De Niro). Shot as a type of coming-of-age thrill as it opens with the future and dissolves into chronological flashbacks. We see the rise and fall of a superstar. Someone sailing on the tight ropes of fame only to let classically let it all go to his mind and body. He is cocky because of what he is. With each battle he grows less human. He's stronger physically, but emotionally, he's lost his sense of sight. Lost all ties to reality and more possessive as the days pass. As he gets a big head through his talents, he grows confident starting courting 15-year-old Viki Thailer (Cathy Moriarity). It starts out well, but it certainly turns sinister as Viki tries to talk to other people. He gets a paranoid persona and develops a rage in him. He starts questioning everything around him and doesn't trust anyone. The beginning of rage starts in the scene where Jake and his brother Joey La Motta (Joe Pesci) were in the middle of an argument at the kitchen table with their wives and baby present. The brothers told their wives to leave and take their children with them. As a form of dominance, Jake changes his attitude from than on.<br/><br/>There were many scenes in which Director Martin Scorsese portrayed a sullen atmosphere in the Black and White cinematic vision. The music, for one, was taken from the works of an Italian composer Pietro Mascagni. Gives the film a sad feeling and brings even more emotion to the actors on screen.<br/><br/>There was a scene in which a section of the film was in color. For this one scene, Scorsese paints a more laminated picture depicting a genial time in Jake's life. Seems a bit contrived to the real world. The black and white to me, has signified the character's true personality. What life really is. Not optimistic. Just is. Life is previewed in a strange light in the film. We're pulled to care for Jake throughout the film and than we care even more as the movie builds these layers surrounding the characters. A true definitive of what the boxing beast can do to anyone. One of my all time 5 favorites."

","Raging Bull is a real stylish drama and it has Robert De Niro, but it looks like Martin Scorsese's gangster movies rather than a sport, boxing movie. This is why it was a big disappointment to me. Therefore, the hype (the greatest boxing film ever made, much better than Rocky series) is just a hype, not true. This is not a sport movie and I know that Martin Scorsese said that he hates sport movies, so he passes over boxing scenes quickly (the boxing scenes are too short) thus there is not enough material on boxing in the movie. Scorsese cannot create his own boxing movie, instead he does what he wants to do, he does what he is good at, a crime drama (that also recalls his other gangster movies as said) Therefore, Raging Bull is not the story of a boxer, instead it is like the story of a mafia boss who has some troubles while trying to rise. I think that there is a polarization among people. According to the first group, Rocky series are unrivaled, especially the first one is great, according to the other group, Rocky is nothing in comparison with Raging Bull, it is better by far as a sport film. Raging Bull is a very good drama, but it fails as a sport movie. By the way, personally I prefer Rocky (especially the first movie, the third movie and the fourth movie) A critic says that Rocky is a thickheaded boxer who does not add anything to the movie, he just fights. He does not have to be smart and when it comes to Raging Bull, they say boxing scenes were great, especially camera usage and editing. No, this is not true, a hype! And by the way, according to some, Raging Bull is Rocky of intellectual people. I don't know why I feel like this, but it seems that yes it is. Scorsese's direction, carefully planned great black and white cinematography and Robert De Niro with one of the most realistic make up makes Raging Bull a must see, but as a sport film it is very disappointing. As for the boxing scenes, if you look for great boxing scenes (except for Rocky), I recommend you the opening scene of John Woo's Broken Arrow."

"gbill-74877","9","4","7","16 June 2016"," Fantastic acting and many memorable moments
","This is a great film on a number of levels – as a biography of former middleweight boxing champion Jake La Motta, yes, but also a fascinating character study, with stellar performances from Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, and epic direction from Martin Scorsese. <br/><br/>The opening sequence sets the stage for something special; De Niro is dancing in place alone in the ring in poetic slow motion, we see the film will be in black and white and there is a smoky haze in the background as the opening credits roll. We will soon see just how crazy this man is, as he turns over the dining table in a fight with his first wife over how long to cook his steak, yells down at his complaining neighbor that he's going to kill and eat his dog, and then goads his younger brother (Pesci) into punching him in the face as hard as he can. Throughout the movie, the dialog between De Niro and Pesci is loud, confrontational, argumentative, and fantastic. <br/><br/>The times were certainly different, and La Motta was part blunt New Yorker and part Cro-Magnon. He makes out with his wife on the floor in front of his sister-in-law and their toddlers. He's insanely jealous, and accuses his brother of having had sex with his wife (lines I will never forget, and sometimes quote: ""I heard things Joey, I heard things""  ""What things you heard?""  ""I heard some things""). After confronting his wife, she ""confesses"" out of frustration, so he marches over to his brother's house and beats him up, also punching his wife in the face in the process, all in front of his brother's stunned kids. <br/><br/>La Motta met his second wife Vikki when she was just 15, and married her when she was 16. In the film she's played well by Cathy Moriarty, though she seems much older (she was only 20 at the time though). In another unforgettable scene, this one erotically charged, she kisses his body when he's not allowed to have sex before a fight, and then after he goes to the sink to pour ice water down his shorts to cool off, shows up in the mirror and begins kissing him some more. Scorsese uses a perfect amount of restraint here, however, and we never 'see' anything. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, he doesn't apply this same restraint to violence in the right, overstating it considerably, even considering the type of fighter La Motta was. We see blood spraying as if it were out of a hose, and boxers enduring more punishment than humanly possible. Maybe this is how Scorsese the man saw boxing, having not been a fan beforehand, or Scorsese the artist preferred to paint the violence of the men involved in the sport. Regardless, it was not necessary. That said, seeing De Niro at the end of the last bout with Sugar Ray Robinson (Johnny Barnes), his face a meatloaf, eyes puffed over but grinning like a ghoul as he tottered over to Sugar Ray, taunting him despite the beating he just took, saying ""ya never got me down Ray"", is another memorable moment.<br/><br/>Cut to 6 years later, a fat La Motta is poolside in Florida smoking a cigar, having retired. The legend is that De Niro gained 60-70 pounds over 4 months by eating high-end food in France and Italy, and it's just another larger-than-life aspect of this movie. It's painful to watch his awkward stand-up act, his crude jokes, his philandering with women in the bar, and getting thrown into jail for having let young teenagers into his bar (they having 'proved' being of legal age by French kissing him). His beer belly hangs out of his shirt while he's in a pay phone. Like an idiot, he hammers the jewels out of his championship belt, looking to pawn them, and not understanding they're worth far more in the belt. He's estranged from his brother, and the scene with De Niro following Pesci out of a convenience store down the street is heart wrenching.<br/><br/>The film ends with De Niro quoting Brando in 'On the Waterfront' as he practices his stand-up act in front of a mirror. He does it with just the right amount of poor delivery (he's acting as La Motta after all) and pathos, it's another great scene, but I have to say, the words themselves ring false - La Motta's brother WAS looking out for him, among other things beating the hell out of some guys in a nightclub when they were getting too close to his wife, and La Motta did NOT end up with a one-way ticket to Palookaville after throwing a fight for the mafia, he ended up with a title fight a couple of years later and won it. <br/><br/>Scorsese may have included too much violence, but he does so many other brilliant things. Black and white was an excellent choice. He uses slow motion to create an epic feel to moments. He uses stills of some of the boxing victories, and footage altered to appear as if it's from old home movies to show events in some of the intervening years. He tells the story with brutal honesty. Most of all, he gives outstanding actors freedom, and they really delivered."
"BA_Harrison","9","4","7","9 December 2015"," A hard-hitting biopic.
","Raging Bull is a raw and gritty look at the turbulent life of middleweight boxing champion Jake La Motta, a rather reprehensible character whose paranoia and insensitivity drove away those he loved and ultimately left him on the skids and in trouble with the law. Even though it's far from what most would class as a fun film, it's still an unmissable slice of cinema, thanks to powerful performances from an excellent cast, and impeccable direction from Martin Scorsese, who handles both the drama and the brutal fight action with plenty of style.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro is not only in tip-top physical form for his role as the world class boxer (at least until he flabs out for the final act), but is also at the top of his game as a thespian, the star fully flexing his acting muscles in a performance that runs the gamut of emotions and which deservedly won him an Oscar. Also making a big impression are Joe Pesci as Jake's brother Joey, a loud-mouthed brawler with ties to the Mafia who is almost as obnoxious as his older sibling, and Cathy Moriarty, as Jake's long-suffering second wife Vickie."
"yj-35639","9","4","7","26 April 2015"," Self-redemption
","""I wanted to push all the way to the very very end and see if I could die. Embracing a way of life to its limit.""<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese<br/><br/>During the making of New York, New York (1977), which turned out to be a box-office failure, the Roman Catholic director, Martin Scorsese, sank into a spiraling abyss of drug addiction. While he was ""embracing a way of life to its limit"", he almost got himself killed after having some ""bad coke"" that caused a massive internal bleeding. Thanks to this wake-up call, he finally kicked off his cocaine addiction with the help of the actor and his close friend, Robert De Niro, with whom he collaborated on all his most notable works. Believing that he would never make another film, Scorsese poured all his energy into making the next film, Raging Bull (1980), which received spectacular success and was voted the greatest film of the 1980s by Britain's Sight & Sound magazine. <br/><br/>Raging Bull is a biographic drama film about an emotionally self-destructive boxer fueled by paranoid jealousy and rage, which lead him to the top of the ring while destroy his life outside of it. The film is not only a redemption, which saved Scorsese from his self-destruction but also a landmark where his film style reached its peak: the expressionistic depict of psychological points of view. In his previous hits, Mean Street (1973) and Taxi Driver (1976), Scorsese rendered the protagonists' psychotic perspectives using high contrasts and aggressive use of bold colors. Raging Bull, shot in high contrast black-and-white, vividly carried out the raging, masochistic and insecure mind state of Jake La Motta through the perfect combination of visual and audio effects. From La Motta's point of view, his wife, Vickie is always in slow motion when she is close to other men. Through the exaggerated depiction of an innocent event, La Motta's jealousy is visually represented. During the most riveting boxing scenes, Scorsese utilizes not only the punching sounds but also the bull roars, flashbulbs, water-running, and even squelching watermelon sound effects to externalize the bubbling rage deep within La Motta. <br/><br/>Brutal and intense as the movie is, it has a poetic and contemplative opening of La Motta shadowboxing alone in the ring. The background music ""Intermezzo"" from the opera Cavalleria Rusticana orchestrates a tragedy that is about to unfold, while La Motta's movements are full of freedom and even transcendence. Interestingly, the movie also ends with La Motta, now an old, fat and failed comedian, shadowboxing in the dressing room before his show. Perhaps Scorsese is trying to suggest that throughout La Motta's whole life, boxing is the physical way in which this self-destructive soul seeks for spiritual absolution. Perhaps the cinematic classic, Raging Bull, is not only about rage and violence, but more about self-redemption."

","There has been a consistent complaint against Martin Scorsese regarding the fact that the protagonists in most of his films are horrible people and Scorsese makes us watch these horrible people do horrible things and so it is very difficult to find anything likable about them. While I agree that many of Scorsese's protagonists are questionable individuals, but Scorsese doesn't just use them and make them do reprehensible acts on screen just for the shock factor. He has always attempted to deeply study these characters. He explores the environment surrounding his characters and in a way he seeks to find the source and the reasons behind the behaviours and natures of his characters. His protagonists aren't always likable, but they are pretty much always interesting and multi-layered.<br/><br/>Raging Bull starring Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and Cathy Moriarty is a biopic based on the life of famed boxing legend Jake Lamotta. The main character is certainly not an individual that you would like to spend too much time with. He is a misogynist, he is massively insecure, he is violent and regularly assaults his wife throughout the film. The boxing ring and the fights are used as a dramatic theme to show and reveal what Lamotta is thinking and what he is going through emotionally. The boxing ring also acts as a means for Jake to legally vent his frustration and all his accumulated anger. Jake Lamotta, in the film at least, is the result of the environment that he grew up in. It is hinted from time to time that maybe he had to spend his childhood in the midst of extensive poverty, which probably has made him as hard and as abrasive as he is shown to be. He has always aimed for the stars and wanted to achieve his goals without anyone else's help. This is a reason why he always refrains from taking the assistance of the mafia, just to glorify his independence. He views everything as a goal or a trophy. The house that he has bought for his father is a trophy to him and a symbol of self assurance that he is a big shot. His car is a trophy which he uses to woo his then would be wife Vickie. But this uncontrolled materialistic mindset gives birth to a massive sense of misogyny. When he meets his future wife Vickie, he only sees her superficial features like her figure, her legs, her cheekbones, etc. So in a way he sees her only as a human trophy and like everything he has achieved before, he makes it his mission to win her. But once he gets her, he never makes an effort to get close to her emotionally. Another thing that is so apparent about the character of Lamotta is his insecurity. After his marriage, this insecurity of his constantly makes him suspicious about his wife's supposed infidelity which slowly drives him mad. These insecurities lead to volcanic eruptions of rage throughout the film, and the ironic thing about it is that the rage that initially made him a world renowned boxer in the ring also destroys his personal life. The eccentric and violent life he leads ultimately also makes it difficult for him to maintain his performances in the boxing ring.<br/><br/>Apart from Jake Lamotta and Vickie, another brilliantly interesting character is that of Joey played by Joe Pesci. His back and forth dialogue with De Niro is absolutely fascinating. The two brothers clearly need each other and really love each other, but the underlying anger between the two brothers is also apparent.<br/><br/>The direction by Martin Scorsese is another character in the film effectively. He makes us completely engaged in the plight of this character. The direction is so intense, that you can't help but feel drained out. You feel the punches, you feel the knockouts and you can't help but feel connected with Lamotta even if you hate him. The fight scenes are some of the most intense scenes I have ever seen. The cinematography is awe inspiring. The film is in black and white and it looks beautiful. I think Scorsese made the film in black and white as a means to recapture the essence of the films in the 1940s and 1950s which are the decades portrayed in the movie.<br/><br/>Last but by no means least,I have to talk about the editing. Scorsese's long time collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker edits this film with a passion. The editing during the boxing scenes is just awe- inspiring. The zoom-ins, the slow motions, the tracking shots are all perfect.<br/><br/>As soon as the opening credits come on the screen with Lamotta jumping around and practicing his punches in the background in slow motion, I knew this was going to be a masterpiece. Interestingly while we look at Lamotta in slow motion in the opening credits sequence, throughout the film Scorsese shows us many things in slow motion from Lamotta's point of view which reveal what his mind is preoccupied with at that precise moment which range from lust, jealousy and rage.<br/><br/>Raging Bull is a masterpiece made by an auteur in his signature intense style. Jake Lamotta is not your regular hero. He is flawed and imperfect. But Scorsese's rich character study makes him iconic due to his imperfections in the movie and the film ends with a monologue sequence that is absolutely heartbreaking."
"classicsoncall","9","4","7","16 April 2011"," ""The man's got a head of rock"".
","You can take Tommy Como's (Nicholas Colasanto) description (above) of Jake La Motta a couple of different ways. La Motta could take a punch like no one else, evidenced by the kitchen scene when he had brother Joey (Joe Pesci) bang away at him trying to prove a point. On another level, La Motta was savaged by his inner demons, making him a tortured, animalistic man who inveighed his wife (Cathy Moriarty) with repeated abuse. Something as picayune as choosing between a cheeseburger and a piece of cake was enough to set him off the deep end. It's Robert De Niro's depiction of La Motta's life outside the squared circle that makes ""Raging Bull"" such a triumph of film making. Not so much a boxing picture as one with boxing in it, the movie explores the depths of one man's depravity and deep seated insecurity that makes him an animal both inside and outside the ring.<br/><br/>Without the boxing however, the film would be an incomplete biography. Tracing La Motta's history from his 1941 loss to Jimmy Reeves on a nine count save at the bell, up to the loss of his Middleweight Title to Sugar Ray Robinson in 1951, the film explores the Raging Bull's turbulent history as an athlete as well. The picture gives a hint of the criminal element involved in fixing matches, and recounts the infamous 1947 Garden match he tanked against Billy Fox. Though they're never mentioned by name, this favor to the Mafia along with a payoff of twenty thousand dollars eventually got La Motta a middleweight title shot against Marcel Cerdan which he won.<br/><br/>Aside from his visceral portrayal of La Motta, Robert De Niro fully went the extra mile gaining sixty pounds to play La Motta in retirement. It just amazes me that an actor would put that much into his craft to achieve that kind of realism, which is just one more reason De Niro is considered one of the best of all time. Interestingly, check it out and see if you agree, in the scene of La Motta having his breakdown in the Dade County stockade he bore an uncanny resemblance to actor William Bendix.<br/><br/>In support, Joe Pesci gives one of the truly amazing performances of his career as well. You know, I don't particularly care for gutter language in film, but when done by Pesci, the colorful use of the F word almost rises to the level of high art. Along with Cathy Moriarty's depiction of wife Vickie, ""Raging Bull"" offers a compelling portrait of a man racked by personal insecurity and inner torment, who's brutal nature could only find release in a sport as physically demanding as boxing."
"ElMaruecan82","9","4","7","3 January 2011"," Brutally Powerful Portrayal of Anger, Frustration and Jealousy
","I understand why this film is regarded as a classic. In fact, from the very beginning, the film has a kind of unique feeling, it's almost shouting, and loudly, ""This is not 'Rocky'"": from the classic opening score, to the shadowy black and white cinematography, the director is the first real star of the film : Martin Scorsese, the heavy-weight champion of film-making, probably the most talented director of his generation. The use of Black & White prevented the film from an overdose of red but the pay-off, was its ""classic"" look. When De Niro was reciting Brando's lines you could almost feel you were watching ""On the Waterfront"".<br/><br/>But I must admit I had mixed feelings with ""Raging Bull"" at first. On one side, I was literally mesmerized by De Niro's brutally powerful performance as a man devoured by jealousy. In fact, this jealousy, driven by a probably very low self-esteem works almost like a gangrene. Following the development of his character, you know that sooner or later, the guy's gonna reach a breaking point and the effects will be devastating. On the other side, this jealousy created a bit of redundancy in the movie, ""let's face it"" (like Terry Malloy would say), the scenes, although beautifully directed, making Vickie La Motta floating from man to man (great job by Marty, jealousy had never been so perfectly captured in film), those scenes were kind of repetitive, and upsetting. Upsetting in a good way because we're not necessarily supposed to root for La Motta but at least react to his shocking behavior and aggressive attitude. And upsetting in a bad way, because I was wondering all through the movie, ""Okay, we got it, the guy is jealous"" until the movie reminded of ""A Women Under the Influence"", another masterpiece where a character's behavior, makes you feel so uncomfortable, you don't want to watch. <br/><br/>And that""s how ""Raging Bull"" is a very particular movie. I hope every fan of this film can at least concede that it takes more than one or two viewings to let the film grow on you. And it's not that easy to consider it one of 'the best ever' after one viewing. ""Raging Bull"" is interesting because it's one of the few character studies that make you question the main roots of the character's behavior, the motives. Travis Bickle was alienated and frustrated, Charlie was torn between friendship and quest for redemption. In La Motta's case, it's hard to come to a conclusion. We know how he is, but why? why such a paranoid behavior that ultimately lead him to lose his family. Paranoia can be explained, take a character like Michael Corleone for instead, but for La Motta, it seemed irrational.<br/><br/>Then I realized the answer was in one, often overlooked, key scene, the Janiro fight. I will blaspheme by comparing the movie to a more recent one, but it reminded me of the scene in ""Fight Club"" when the narrator destroyed Angel Face -'something beautiful'. The violence La Motta injected in that fight made it look like a personal vengeance, massacring, 'executing' Janiro's face as a message to his wife, ""you thought he was pretty, now he ain't pretty no more"". Ruthless, but powerful, because it shows how low is his self-esteem. Destruction is the weapon of the envious, he doesn't try to improve himself but to destroy the challenger and stay the one and only one. <br/><br/>Low self-esteem doesn't mean lack of an ego, but La Motta's one is so twisted, so hard to grab, to understand, we try at least to find it sympathetic, and it only works because the character is pathetic, victim of himself. And this characteristic finally redeems him in the iconic jail scene, where the pathos reaches its paroxysm, when he can finally shout, break down, hit the wall with his bare fists and his head, and cry, realizing how hard he failed. This is the highlight of the film, the scene that makes him profoundly human, and as a viewer, I could at least make peace with him and appreciate the character, and the film. This is the pay-off of all the frustration, anger, discomfort I felt.<br/><br/>Jake thought his wife was a whore, blinded by an extreme machismo tainted with paranoid jealousy. He even accused his brother, his only real friend of being a member of this conspiracy. At the end, he lost everything. How pathetic he was outside the ring contrasts with his strength and ferocity inside, he hits and takes the hits, exorcising his own demons in this arena where he's the king. ""Raging Bull"" is often compared with ""Rocky"", well, despite the difference of mood, one thing they have in common, is how the ring appears to be an allegory for desire of revenge. In ""Raging Bull"", some shots are so aesthetically exaggerated that it's like it was intended to be kept proportional to all the griefs, all the feelings of low self-esteem that were burning in Jake's mind. In the ring, these feelings explode like a geyser of blood. Even when the Bull finds his ""toreador"", he's ugly and destroyed, but he's still standing, he's still ""the boss"".<br/><br/>I used to be very critical towards ""Raging Bull"", I never understood why this film was praised as one of the best ever, or #4 in AFI's Top 100. Now, I know it's a raw portrayal of a man we don't feel sympathy for him because we don't want to, the character is not to blame. We are, we're no better than La Motta because at least he took the hits until the ""right"" one hit him in the face. It took me time to realize that ""Raging Bull"" was indeed a masterpiece. Don't blame me. I guess all I can say is that ""once I was blind and now I can see."""

","Alright, so maybe it's The Best Sports Film I've Seen, but it's unlikely that I'll ever see a sports film, or maybe any film, with a performance as powerful as the one Robert DeNiro delivers as Jake La Motta. DeNiro delivers every single range of emotion perfectly while turning a highly unsympathetic character into a remarkably memorable figure in cinema. This also leaves out the fact that Robert DeNiro gains a ton of weight for his role as La Motta. Robert DeNiro's performance as Jake La Motta is possibly the best performance in motion picture history. It's probably Martin Scorsese's best work(meaning better than ""Goodfellas""), the definitive film of the 1980's, the best sports film ever, and one of the greatest movies of all time."

","Raging Bull is the definitive art film. It is also hauntingly poetic. It really isn't a movie about boxing as much as about a man with psychological and sexual complexities that he takes out on in the ring. It is a case study on the male masculinity. The only other picture that comes close to this one in terms of male masculinity is maybe Othello. But even that is pushing it! This is one of the few pictures that ever made me cry because many of those emotions of fear, anger, frustration, and rage I feel all the time and can relate to the material. I agree it is the best film of the 1980's and is included in my top 10 favorite films of all time. Kudos to De Niro and Pesci who work together as a great team.

But yet the movie is extremely powerful and interesting to watch because of mainly 2 aspects; Scorsese's fantastic, almost poetic directing and the performances by all of the actors.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro, Cathy Moriarty and Joe Pesci give away some impressive acting performances. All three were nominated for an Oscar but only De Niro got to take the statue home with him. Also the fact that he gained an impressive 60 pounds for his role as the 'older' Jake La Motta must have helped him with his win.<br/><br/>The movie is filmed in atmospheric black & white. The camera angles are all extremely simple but they work extremely effective. The classical music by Pietro Mascagni also adds to the atmosphere of the movie.<br/><br/>The directing and acting truly make this movie memorable and interesting to watch. Even the scene's were nothing is really happening are made with such profession that it's a shear pleasure to watch. The boxing scene's are filmed highly original and with much gore (Ever seen a nose being broken?). I especially like the boxing matches between La Motta and Sugar Ray Robinson.<br/><br/>But this movie is way more than just a boxing or sports movie.

"adlei_b","10","5","10","2 March 2008"," Awesome movie
","Some of the comments regarding this film make me scratch my head until I'm scratching bone. This IS a classic movie. Make no mistake. De Niro didn't get an Oscar simply for putting on a lot of weight, his portrayal of Jake La Motta is spot on. De Niro acts the part out in perfect symmetry with La Motta's autobiography. Since when was it important to have characters to whom you can feel sympathy leading the film? Do you feel sympathy for Jeff Bridges in the Big Lebowski? He's a stoned waster doing nothing with his life, but that's a classic. And does every film need to have a message for us? I'd feel a bit offended if every film I payed good money to see attempted to preach some sort of fable down my throat just so I can leave and think I saw a good film. What do West Side Story and the Bourne films teach us? Don't fall in love with someone you shouldn't and don't get involved in illegal Government operations? Why thankyou for telling me. Maybe I'm spending more time challenging this movie's haters rather than bigging it up, but I hope that that reflects positively on the movie. It's worth defending against people who feel hard done by because the movie was too taxing for them. The boxing scenes are amazing in this film, better than any of the boxing scenes in the Rocky films - which are excellent movies as well. La Motta said De Niro could have gone on to become a pro boxer he was so good after training up. The black and white, in my opinion, lends itself perfectly to catching the brutal violence that is central to the movie, spit and blood flying everywhere, impressing on the viewer the visceral nature of boxing and Jake La Motta. He's no hero, but that's no reason not to make a film about him. Great film, great acting from everyone involved - Joe Pesci has some serious napoleon syndrome going on - and an overall entertaining experience.<br/><br/>And as for mfplajos's comments, you're an arrogant idiot. Great you have a BA, pat on the back for you. Do you mean to say we should take movie recommendations more seriously if they come from someone with letters after their name?

"Spleen","4","10","25","20 July 2001"," A more restrained, less full-throated bull than I'd expected
","Here, in a nutshell, is why ""Raging Bull"" must renounce its claim to being a great movie: Jake's monologue at the end.  It was lifted word for word from ""On the Waterfront"".  It's not plagiarism: Jake is quoting, and we know he's meant to be quoting, from a movie he's seen, but that's the problem - those quotation marks.  Had they been FAKE quotation marks, had Jake been quoting some non-existent movie, all might have been well.  Had there been NO quotation marks, all might have been well.  (It's not Scorsese's fault if the most fitting words Jake could possibly utter turn out to have already been used back in 1954; if the words fit seamlessly into his movie just as well as into the earlier one, he should simply steal them, and leave the attribution of credit for the fine print at the end.)  The trouble is that when it comes time for a moment of truth ""Raging Bull"" is unable to speak for itself.  Its reach exceeds its grasp - it's as simple as that.<br/><br/>There are things IMPRESSIVE about the film, like the brilliantly edited fight sequences, and De Niro's performance.  The extended scene in which Jake suspects his wife of having sex with his brother is electrifying.  But in context these aren't enough to sustain us.  The fight sequences are interludes: over quickly, the outcome obvious from the first second, they're one-sentence summaries of the true dramatic action, which take place outside the ring.  As they should be; but this means that they can't carry the film on their own however brilliant they may be (and they ARE brilliant).  And DeNiro's performance needs something solid to spark off, which neither the story nor the other characters provides.<br/><br/>Another problem: it isn't really a black and white film.  It's TINTED monochrome.  (I can think of only one instance of Technicolor monochrome actually working: the afterlife sequences in ""A Matter of Life and Death"". There was no tinting.  I think there's a good reason why tinted monochrome vanished off the face of the Earth in the late 1920s, while films were still being ROUTINELY made in black and white in the 1960s.)  The title was in red, and some home movie sequences were in faded colour.  This half-hearted use of colour just looked weak.  Make up your mind: colour, black and white, or (if you're certain you know what you're doing) a combination of both. Not, for God's sake, a BLEND.<br/><br/>I was let down when ""Raging Bull"" turned out to be no more than an above average Scorsese potboiler, with some outstanding elements.  I really wanted it to be the great film so many people say it is.  A cinematic hero of mine, Michael Powell, greatly admired it, and to some degree inspired it.  I wish it were worthy of him."

I'm not a fan of any particular director/actor/actress - the finished product has to get to me. I think I've seen only one film with De Niro that isn't brutal - ""The Score""......anyone else see that ?

Now I am NOT saying the film isn't well made--it's very well crafted and there a lot of things to admire about it....but the characters (particularly Jake) are so awful that you just marvel at them.<br/><br/>The film is the life story of Jake LaMotta and it covers from his early days as a professional boxer in 1941 through his early post-boxing years. However, there are many things that make it quite different from films like ""Somebody Up There Likes Me"" and ""Rocky""--and not just the bubbling hostility of Jake outside the ring. In addition, those around him are incredibly harsh and unpleasant. It's funny, but the mobsters around him are NICER than the LaMottas (Jake and his almost as vicious brother, Joey) and you see them as the gentlemen in the film! Also, unlike these other boxer films, this one shows the brutality in the ring to a degree only approximated in one other film--Kirk Douglas' ""Champion""--though ""Raging Bull"" manages to go a few steps further in the brutality department. A few of the boxing scenes, in particular, are amazingly graphic--with broken noses and squirting blood galore. Now I know I might sound crazy saying this, but this Martin Scorsese film is probably one of the best indictments AGAINST boxing because it IS so bloody and brutal. I'd place it among films like ""Requium For a Heavyweight"" and ""The Harder They Fall"" as the best in anti-boxing films! So let's talk about the technical aspects of the film. When it comes to the boxing sequences, this is an amazing film. As I said above, the brutality of the scenes is stomach-turning. And, instead of quickly filming the matches, the director chose to choreograph them so maximize the emotional impact--with loud thuds, great lighting and amazing effects to simulate the gallons of blood spilled in the fights. My only complaint about the fights is that the boxers simply threw too many punches. No boxing match (even the lightweight ones) has THAT much punching in rapid succession. If they did, they'd never go more than three rounds, as the fighters would collapse from exhaustion! But, this exaggeration did make the scenes more intense, so I saw it as a case of artistic license. As for making the film in black & white, I think this also worked well.<br/><br/>The acting was pretty amazing. A lot has been said about Robert DiNero's commitment to the role--and how he deliberately ballooned up 60 pounds to play the retired LaMotta. In addition, the intense physical training he underwent to become the character was amazing. You have to admire his willingness to give his all for the part! When I looked for pictures of Jake, Joey and Mrs. LaMotta, I was also amazed that the actors (DiNero, Joe Pesci and Cathy Moriarty) really did look a lot like the actual people they portrayed--a nice touch. Overall, an exceptional film in most every way, though it's NOT a film for everyone. The unpleasantness of the film make it something that many simply don't want to endure--and I can certainly understand this--it is bloody and vicious throughout."

","What can we say about the movie that already hasn't been said. I always believed that the movie should be better than it's story. Raging Bull had no story, yet it is the best movie ever made. After the first two godfathers, Raging Bull is definitely the best.
De niro, whose career is better than all the other actors, with films like The Godfather Part II, Taxi Driver, The Deer Hunter, The King Of Comedy, Once Upon A Time In America, Goodfellas, Heat, Casino and recently Joker, and yet Jake La Motta in Raging Bull is his best performance. He even got an Oscar to back my statement. The method acting crossed another height with this movie. De Niro gained 60 pounds(don't know how much that is but sounds and looked heavy) for this role and became a semi professional boxer. So, yeah, this is his best performance.
Martin Scorsese, the best director of all time with movies like, Taxi Driver, The King Of Comedy, Goodfellas, Casino, The Wolf Of Wallstreet, Shutter Island, Cape Fear, The Departed, Mean Streets, The Aviator..... And yet Raging Bull is his best. He didn't get an Oscar for it, but when the Master himself tells us that Raging Bull is his best we ought to believe it."

","Oh, you want to know what kind of film this is? This film was directed by a person who had just been on the verge of dying after a drug overdose. That is the kind of film this is.<br/><br/>Comparisons between this movie and Rocky are inevitable, but the differences are obvious. This is a much darker, aggressive film: There is nothing emotionally rewarding about it. It is not ""almost too much"". No, it is actually obnoxious.<br/><br/>Needless to say, not everyone will like it. It is not an emotionally attractive film, and many will find that they cannot relate to the incredibly violent, deranged character of Jake LaMotta. I would not be surprised if someone gave this movie a 1-star review because of how horrifically, frighteningly off-putting his personality is. In this film, he is both the protagonist and the antagonist.<br/><br/>Perception aside, let's look at the real meat of this movie.
The co-screenwriter stated that the issue with this movie was that it ""has been done a hundred times before -- a fighter who has trouble with his brother and his wife and the mob is after him""<br/><br/>Yet this is considered one of the greatest movies of all time by many, despite the fact that so many people are turned off by the subject matter. Why?<br/><br/>This is, without a doubt, a filmmaker's film. If we take a detailed look at the cinematography, acting, editing, and dialog, you must ask the question: Honestly, Is there any question? It is, truly, some of the best you can expect to find in a movie. The technical skill put into this movie is mindblowing. This is why people like Roger Ebert are so captivated by this movie.<br/><br/>It is hard to say that this movie is fantastic because it is incredibly difficult to watch and is, by vote, not entertaining. However, it is a technical masterpiece, and from beginning to end, it is an excellently produced movie.
For most, this is not a fun movie. It is, however, a fun movie to analyze. Not a bad pick if you are looking for a professional movie, but not something you'd watch with family."

","A newcomer's face busted up in a fit of jealous rage. Spectators being trampled by an angry crowd. Our protagonist's face swollen so badly that he can barely even see. These are some of the images Martin Scorsese presents to us in ""Raging Bull"", and they are beautiful. Beautiful in their starkness and rawness, beautiful in the masterful black-and-white photography of cinematographer Michael Chapman, and beautiful in how they illustrate the depressing tale of Jake LaMotta.<br/><br/>LaMotta (Robert De Niro) is a man of surfaces. After one look at the beauty of teenage Vicky (Cathy Moriarty), he makes the decision of pursuing her and eventually marrying her, leaving his first wife in the process. He becomes violently jealous at the sight of Vicky greeting other men with innocent hugs and kisses. And he himself is all surface. This is a man with no great complexities, no real depth to his character, driven almost purely on the animal instincts of lust and rage. And in this characteristic lies the key to his downfall. LaMotta is so incapable of dealing with these base tendencies that he allows them to destroy him, driving away anyone close to him and causing his life to implode in the process. By the end of the film, he has become a washed-up loser who owns a sports bar in which he delivers his joke of a comedy routine. A pitiful shadow of the raging bull he once was.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro gives one of the most brutally raw performances in modern film history (this is his best, excluding ""Taxi Driver""). No matter what scene he's in, he completely transforms into Jake LaMotta, whether it be his viciousness in the ring, his bullying outside of it, or his sleaziness and decadence in his later years. Nobody but De Niro could do such a great job of portraying a man constantly at his boiling point.<br/><br/>He's fully backed up by the supporting cast, mainly Joe Pesci as his brother and manager Joey, and Moriarty as Vicky. Pesci and De Niro have some of the greatest chemistry in film history, and Pesci's work here rivals his Tommy DeVito in Goodfellas. Moriarty is sublime as a woman equal parts victim and schemer who gets drawn into LaMotta's whirlpool of rage at an age where she's too young to know better.<br/><br/>All in all, ""Raging Bull"", like much of Scorsese's work, is a tragedy about an immoral, violent man whose personal flaws lead to his downfall. It shows the tragedy of a man who had all the potential in the world, but because of his ineptitude in handling his personal life, blasted straight into the gutter and brought everyone else down with him."
"jonputtman-9980346","9","3","5","4 January 2018"," Scorsese Shines
","Scorsese brilliantly crafted this stunning film. From the opening titles to the very last scene where Robert De Niro restates Marlon Brando's famous line from the 1954 Best Picture winning epic, On the Waterfront. When that line is said, the entire movie rushed back into my mind, as if Scorsese wrapped it all up in a bundle and handed it to me. The line was not only fitting for the movie, but for the scene itself. The last scene sets up how Jake LaMotta might just go somewhere, as he clearly does for a movie was made on him. The saying of this quote had me in tears, as it really put an emphasis on a waste of a man's life. <br/><br/>I also loved how it was shot in black and white. As in Schindler's List, the usage of this feature really dramatized the effects used and the entirety of the sadness depicted from Scorsese's masterful interpretation and the events that were happening. As I have always said, in black-and-white movies, there are some things that can be seen that cannot be seen in color films. The acting seems to soak in more, and the intentions of the director and writer are more intense. Possibly, it's because we see in ""black-and-white"", and this brings us to another reality that only we can see. <br/><br/>Scorsese's shots are very clean, and use his typical dynamics. When LaMotta is losing to Sugar Robinson about half way through the movie, LaMotta sits down, and Scorsese, as if moving the camera himself with his hands, zooms up to LaMotta from the other side of the boxing ring. It's beautifully perfect and holds a clean and steady shot that lasts in my memory. <br/><br/>The writing for the film was exceptional, and it was really well crafted. The dialogue was believable and was not as heavy as let's say, Woody Allen's 1977 romantic comedy, Annie Hall. The film held to itself, speaking only for itself, and there has yet to be another movie like it to date, except for as I stated earlier, Schindler's List. <br/><br/>Robert De Niro's acting was superb in this film in his role as Jake LaMotta. Not only did he master the enormous weight gain he needed for the part, but he also mastered the intensity of the role. In the scene where LaMotta is thrown in jail, the character starts talking bad to the officers, then to himself. He then gets up off of the bench he was sitting on and continually punches the stone wall, not only with his fists but with his head too. He then sits down again with his face half lighted. De Niro's amazing emotion conquest in this scene exerts the power an actor can have over a character."
"rat_202","9","3","5","30 November 2017"," It's not a boxing film!
","Yep, that's right. Raging Bull is not a film about boxing, but a boxer. Fight footage actually takes up very little of the movie. Yet, it casts a huge shadow over boxing movies to this day. <br/><br/>Firstly, there's De Niro's truly mesmerising performance. I don't consider Raging Bull to be his best film (that's Goodfellas) but it's certainly his best performance. De Niro excels at playing flawed characters, and La Motta is no exception. Jake may be one of the toughest SOB's around but essentially, he's a very insecure man, always paranoid that his beautiful wife is playing away, trusting no-one. He gives one of his opponents a sound beating because his wife dared to say he was good looking. Not to mention attacking his own brother. Bobby's total immersion in the character is amazing, he IS Jake. And he doesn't try to sugarcoat or gloss over the fact that Jake is... not a great guy. Also, he took the Method acting to another level. Obviously, he wasn't the first actor to bulk up for a role, but he was the first to take it to such extremes. Now you have the likes of Christian Bale constantly gaining and losing weight, but Bobby set the standard. Also, he trained professionally as a fighter. Believe me, boxing training ain't easy. Apparently he got really good, as well. Since then lots of respected thesps - Washington, Day-Lewis, Crowe - have played pugilists and all have trained with professionals. All thanks to De Niro.<br/><br/>Scorsese's bravura direction deserves mention, of course. How he consistently got these performances out of De Niro is a wonder. The brutality of the boxing (and many non-boxing) scenes is something else. His decision to shoot in black and white but with modern cinema techniques makes for a very arresting film. Some of the cinematography is just incredible. The opening, the Sugar Ray fight...Marty lost out on the best director Oscar to Robert Redford for Ordinary People that year, which also beat Raging Bull to Best Picture but time has proved which is the better movie. <br/><br/>Joe Pesci's finest moment may have been some years off yet (Goodfellas, again!) but he is totally believable as Jake's brother. He is likable and for the most part level-headed, so it's really tough to watch the part where Jake really beats him over a misunderstanding. Equally tough is Jake's lame, but genuine attempt to reconcile. And whatever happened to Cathy Moriarty? She's excellent here."

","Considered by many as Scorsese's finest film and even as one of the greatest films of all time, this autobiography of the pugilist Jake LaMotta (played by De Niro with utmost intensity) was not about his fights inside the ring but inside his paranoid, inarticulate, and jealous mind. After a disappointing turn in their last film together that almost ended the director's life, the one-two punch duo of star and director returned in the screen with force and bravura, earning Scorsese his first Oscar nomination for Best Director and De Niro his second Oscar win.<br/><br/>One of the many reasons this film worked is because the themes that Scorsese had dealt with in his more personal films are present here, blending his style with a brilliant black-and-white photography from Michael Chapman, and Schoonmaker's Oscar winning work in the editing room.<br/><br/>""Raging Bull"" is the anti-Rocky, although Irwin Winkler and Robert Chartoff who both produced the uplifting boxing saga re-united here, in a bleak high contrast black-and-white film about a former contender who ends up as a bloated washed-up nightclub owner."

","After watching the interviews on the special features disc I understood that I had to upgrade my rating for this film, from six stars to nine. In particular, the views of Oscar-winning Thelma Schoonmaker were decisive. Her words, as also those of the other interviewees, were exceptionally positive and persuasive. However, I still don't much like the picture. <br/><br/>It is noted on the internet that much of Scorsese's work addresses Sicilian-American identity, and Roman Catholic concepts of guilt, faith and redemption. His films also deal with machismo, misogyny, crime and gang conflict. Many of them are notable for their depictions of violence and liberal use of obscenity. In general, I find these topics, the vicious atmospheres and anti-ethical climate they generate, to be off-putting and negative. The after-taste is unpleasant. Sin, murder, steal as much as you've a mind to, just confess and Heaven will smile. As long as there's a crucifix above your bed. These values don't appeal. The story of Jake La Motta is remarkable, but not inspiring.<br/><br/>In spite of this, or because of it, Scorsese extracts uniformly great performances from his actors. De Niro was outstanding, not only for his extra 60 pounds; and Pesci and Moriarty were up with him, in the vividly lived-in reality of their roles.<br/><br/>Some comment on the movie's subject, Mr La Motta, seems necessary. As of this review, this man was still amazingly alive and well, aged 95. Now he has died. He is reported to have had the greatest chin in boxing history. Considering the treatment it endured, his body must have been encased in hardened leather, and his head constructed of concrete. In the extra features interview he was highly lucid, and unrepentant."

","How far can repressed anger get? That's the question that deserved a Martin Scorsese film as an answer. Raging Bull(1980), is a genre mix that transits between Italian neorrealism, semi-documentary, biography and noir. The relation between Jake's personal life and professional career is the great element explored by Scorsese. LaMotta, that unloads all of his efforts to control his wife and brother's lives. It is in the cinematography and in the editing that rests the beauty that makes Raging Bull a grand exhibition of cinema. During the fight scenes, the viscerality and freneticity of the combats are marked by fast cuts, with some perspective of the photographers, abusing of close-ups and blood. As the principal objective from the screenplay is to show Jake's rise to fame and downfall, Scorsese builds the plot so genially, that when the spectator questions why did it all go wrong? He will find only one answer, Jake LaMotta."

","8.5/10<br/><br/>We are society and society is us.<br/><br/>This line is what the movie justifies. It is the story of a boxer named Jake La Motta who lived in ego throughout his life thinking that he needed nobody. It was his aggression that made him winner on ""Achieving his life goals"" part but a sore loser in his personal life. Hence, the society never accepted him and it turned on the cycle of hatred and nonacceptance for La motta.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese is one director who has bested his understanding of society, we can observe that in his movies. In this movie he portrays a boxer who according to me suffers ""Psychological illness"". Psychic illness here means La motta's never ending ego, which was satisfied by his boxing career but not the society. At this point the director challenges both the society and the one with ego because both are unable to accept each other. Scorsese knows the meaning of society as well as its relation to one's personality, his life and the most importantly his pride. Ego is nothing but the excuse for one's failure to blend in with the people or the thinking that the society should be grateful towards them for no particular reason. The script is just perfectly written. A great director's first ability is to make a movie on what he/she thinks the world should be like. Though it is a biography still Scorsese has made it look as if it is his thoughts which are being portrays through the biography. He deserved a academy award for this.<br/><br/>A script this good needed a actor who could bring the character of Lamotta to life and yet again Robert DE Niro does not fail to surprise you. Two actors who should not be reviewed for acting are De Niro and Pacino. He has done tremendous acting here. Joe Pesci as Joey LaMotta's brother is perfect. Rest of the cast has done some great work.<br/><br/>The movie is well edited. Frankly, I did not like the black and white environment and neither the cinematography, for which I have deducted 1.5 rating.<br/><br/>Overall the movie is great, it tells the story of a man destroyed by his obsession to achieve something great.<br/><br/>Being obsessive towards your goals is fine but too much obsession might make you not to enjoy what you have achieved."

Jake's brother Joey LaMotta (Joe Pesci) discusses a potential shot for the middleweight title with one of his Mafia connections, Salvy Batts (Frank Vincent). Some time thereafter, Jake spots a 15-year-old girl named Vikki (Cathy Moriarty) at an open-air swimming pool in his Bronx neighborhood. He eventually pursues a relationship with her, even though he is already married. In 1943, Jake defeats Sugar Ray Robinson, and has a rematch three weeks later.

In addition to DeNiro's benchmark acting performance, this film has some of the most outstanding cinematography that has ever been seen. The fight scenes are like ballet; for example, using the Air on a G String as the two fighters pummel one another. This is true genius. We get to see the humanity of LaMotta, a complex, somewhat violent man, carefully configured before our eyes. The use of black and white also gives us a sense of the 1940's boxing movies and then steps them up for us. There is a kind of starkness that never detracts from the endgame."

Agree or disagree, I consider this to be Scorsese's best movie by a long shot.<br/><br/>Based on the book of the same name, Raging Bull's main star is (unsurprisingly) Jake LaMotta; an up and coming young middleweight boxer who despite taking a few initial setbacks from his rivals like 'Sugar' Ray Robinson he gradually overcomes them through the passage of time and eventually clutches the revered Champion belt in 1949. But throughout this passage of time we see LaMotta fallout with his first wife(?) over a petty piece of steak resulting in her implied exile and then begins an intimate relationship with a blonde teenage girl named Vicki who, despite Jake's younger brother having doubts over the feasibility of it, becomes head over heels to Jake's boisterous attitude and masculinity, the cracks are now showing...<br/><br/>Again like my Scarface review earlier I'm not going to reveal anymore crucial plot elements in case I unnecessarily spoil the film for others but like any other Scorsese product it's impeccably acted by Robert De Niro who perfectly embodies the persona a man brimming with aggressiveness and a horrible knack for fits of jealous rage, Joe Pesci is castes as the equally hot-tempered but well-intentioned Joey LaMotta and Cathy Moriarty plays the vulnerable Vicki LaMotta; husband to a shell of a man she once knew and loved.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese has never made a better work of art than this, a relatable cautionary tale about what hostile emotions can lead to and its consequences on others is one that everybody should watch and take head especially before the next time somebody contemplates using their wife or any other relative as a punching bag for their irrational feelings."

"StevePulaski","10","3","5","31 March 2012"," He isn't nervous that you did it, he's nervous why you won't admit it
","After watching Rocky a few months ago, I doubted that I'd ever see a boxing film that would live up to or surpass its status. It was a trend-starter of a film, that didn't follow a blueprint, but accidentally formed one, that would become carbon-copied and mimicked like Jaws did for shark films. Then along came Raging Bull, a film by the almighty Scorsese. This marks the fifth film of his that I have awarded a perfect score, and the fifth film I've reviewed of his as well.<br/><br/>Why do I idolize Scorsese? I find him to be a rare treasure in film. His ability to tackle any story, from a paranoid boxer, to the underground mobsters, to gambling tycoons, to the inter-workings of an Irish gang, to an amazing aviator-turned germaphobe, Scorsese can do it. And make it a work of incorruptible, undeniable art. He is often taken for granted, and not appreciated like he should be. Whether people like to admit it or not, he revolutionized cinema, and will continue to do it for many, many more years.<br/><br/>Raging Bull was De Niro's plea to Scorsese to stop using cocaine, and to direct the film he wanted to for years. Scorsese has gone on record saying that De Niro practically saved his life, persuading, if not forcing, him to make the film. Scorsese has stated that Raging Bull was ""kamikaze style filmmaking,"" because originally, he never thought he'd make another film. That all changed when the film was met with acclaim from audiences and critics around the country, and three amazing talents, De Niro, Pesci, and Scorsese, were born.<br/><br/>The film follows middleweight boxer Jake LaMotta (De Niro), a violent, insecure man who has become obsessed with not only the sport and art of boxing, but controlling everything in his life. He marries a young women named Vicky (Moriarty), and is coached and assisted greatly by his brother Joe (Pesci). Upon marrying Vicky is when Jake's real insecurity and paranoia unfolds. He is constantly fearing that Vicky is seeing other men behind his back. One day, she comments that the boxer Jake's about to fight is a young, limber, good-looking guy who might get the best of him. Before Jake can even consider the other two facts, he stops and lectures her and asks why she calls him ""good-looking."" When it comes to fighting the guy, Jake assures he'll never be called good-looking by anyone for a long time.<br/><br/>Main writer Paul Schrader, who also worked on other Scorsese films such as The Last Temptation of Christ and Taxi Driver, does a brilliant job of giving these characters, not only descriptions and stories, but long, healthy monologues that never become routine or laborious. My personal favorite scene is when both Jake and Joe are discussing personal matters while one is trying to fix the Television. The scene goes on for over four minutes, but the dialog is crisp and nothing shy of gripping. This scene is crucial to the plot because it shows Jake's insecurity consuming him and virtually eating him alive. Who can you trust when everyone looks like an enemy? The film is heavily stylistic as well, probably Scorsese's most to date. If anything should be praised, it's the experimental shots Scorsese uses. There are tracking shots that show depth and space, sometimes distorting it, like during the fight scenes, a delightful and rare coherency to the relentless and bloody combat sequences, that are gritty and brutally realistic, and the high contrast black and white further evokes depression and melancholy emotions to the film.<br/><br/>This is a beautifully made film in every sense of the word. It's a deep, involving character study on a character we can't stand to look at sometimes. The third act focuses on where LaMotta's nervousness and insecurity got him in life; an ungrateful, cocky, intolerable, narcissistic brute that feels entitled to anything and everything. Yet again, this is a story from Scorsese about short lived glory. Where a man's inner demons and personal conflicts further bog him down to where he becomes unable to function normally. We've seen it before, but every time we do, it seems as if it is told in a richer, more complex way.<br/><br/>With all this talk of style, emotion, characteristics, and backstory, let's not forget about another very important element; the rich performances. De Niro is superb, showing passion, charisma, and dedication - all the traits which have lead him to be called ""one of the greatest actors of all time."" Pesci shows great control whenever he's on screen, also brewing his trademark animalistic behavior that has made him instantly recognizable and the subject of many peoples' praise. But let's not forget some side characters that have, over the years, gotten the cold shoulder. Frank Vincent, one of Scorsese's regulars, plays Sal, one of Joe's local connections with the mob in New York. Vincent has been in both Casino and Goodfellas as a supporting character and has never drummed up acclaim of his own. Here, he is spot on perfection, and somewhat underdeveloped and underutilized.<br/><br/>Another performance that hasn't garnered enough fame is Cathy Moriarty as De Niro's wife. She is in a harsh position, like most women in Scorsese's films. She is strong, capable, and commendable in her efforts to break free of never-ending torment and fear caused by her husband.<br/><br/>Raging Bull is absolutely extraordinary filmmaking, from a director that was hesitant about creating the film in the first place. I'm sure he never thought the film would amount to much, but it has already earned a spot on the National Film Registry, two Oscars, and a place on AFI's list of best films. I'd say it was a worthy gamble, and a lifesaver on Scorsese's part.<br/><br/>Starring: Robert De Niro, Cathy Moriarty, Joe Pesci, and Frank Vincent. Directed by: Martin Scorsese."
"jaysilentbob37","10","3","5","26 December 2011"," The pinnacle of the DeNiro/Scorsese collaborations.
","Martin Scorsese is the epitome of the modern filmmaker. My idol if you will. The guy puts his all into everything he touches. His energy and attention to detail are rarely matched. And he consistently churns out one solid movie after another, with even his lesser works [(Gangs of New York (2002), Shutter Island (2010)] standing out above almost everything else that comes out in terms of quality. While his movies are consistently solid even if not always perfect, more than a few have stood out as timeless, essential classics that will forever go down in film history. Goodfellas (1990) and Taxi Driver (1976) are widely noted as being arguably the greatest films of their respective decades. His greatest masterpiece, Raging Bull (1984), follows in this tradition. It's the best movie of the 80's.<br/><br/>Scorsese brings us the life of middleweight boxing champion Jake LaMotta, one of the least likable protagonists in cinematic history, in a way that makes us fully sympathize with him. That alone is a testament to Scorsese's power as a director, but it's also no coincidence that Scorsese's holy trinity all star Robert DeNiro. Without DeNiro, there'd be no Raging Bull, literally and figuratively. This is a passion project between two friends that went a long way, and that passion shows in every beautifully crafted image. And Robert DeNiro's performance is the stuff of legends, easily one of the top five performances ever caught on film. If LaMotta had been played by anyone else, he most likely would have come off as a soulless thug, not worth caring about. DeNiro plays it differently.<br/><br/>Jake LaMotta is a born champion in the boxing ring, with a knack for fiercely annihilating his opponents. He is becoming a true star in the sport. Life should be good. But it isn't, and it never really has been. Jake LaMotta is a completely insecure and self-destructive individual with a brutal temper. His friends and family, though they care about him, are always on their toes and watching what they say around him. His emotional instability causes him to destroy his relationships with everyone close to him. He truly thinks that he loves his wife, Vickie, and she honestly wants to see the good in him. His brother Joey stands by him, isn't afraid of him, and tries to keep him in line while managing his boxing career. But when Jake begins to suspect that Joey and Vickie are having an affair, the rage that leads him to the top in the ring begins to seep into his personal life, worse so than ever before. It may even mean the last straw for the eternally patient Joey.<br/><br/>The story works because it explores the soul of a hopeless misanthrope without judging him. You feel like you better understand certain people after experiencing Raging Bull. Jake is as three- dimensional as characters come. Despite his inability to be a good person, his desire to do good is always clear. So is Jake a bad person? More a pathetic one. He's his own worst enemy, and that's why we can't completely fault him. This is what Scorsese and DeNiro clearly understood. The movie doesn't tell you what to think of him, and DeNiro doesn't play it any certain way. Raging Bull simply is LaMotta's life, and DeNiro is LaMotta.<br/><br/>Contrary to popular belief, Raging Bull isn't really a ""boxing movie."" The boxing scenes occupy only a few minutes of screen time, and there is no big match to determine the fate of the characters. It's a character movie, and boxing is the only thing that keeps the character going. As far as the fight scenes go however, they are as good as they've ever been done. The black and white cinematography compliments them very well. It emphasizes the splattering blood which appears as black and thick as Hershey's syrup. Also different from other boxing dramas is the lack of crowd participation in the fights. Rather than focus equally on the drama in and out of the ring, Scorsese's camera puts you right in the ring with the fighters. Every punch is felt, and as brief as they are, the scenes leave you feeling bruised. They're as raw as it gets.<br/><br/>I could pontificate on this movie's endless list of quality attributes for pages and pages. I'll close by saying that Raging Bull is quite possibly the greatest movie from the greatest living filmmaker. It's cinematic art at it's highest form, a tone poem, a character study, and a biography all flawlessly rolled into one majestic package. Unless you're offended by raw language and uncensored depictions of the uglier side of life, there's essentially nothing to complain about when it comes to Raging Bull. 10/10."
"RJBurke1942","9","3","5","13 May 2011"," Where you can almost feel the anger of this very angry fighter.
","Discussion – and argument – will no doubt persist about ""so-and-so is the greatest fighter of all time."" Does it make any sense, except perhaps to stimulate conversation, to keep comparing prize fighters? The only certainty, in this context, is this: if you like boxing and want to see one of the best films ever made about the business, then this is for you.<br/><br/>Because, not only will you hear one of the best scripts put to film, see some of the finest acting on film and watch scenes from the explosive career of a boxing legend, you'll also see another of Martin Scorsese's expert work as director. If you shy away from truly crude language, however, you probably won't abide the continual use of the F-word and the sexually explicit language between husbands and wives, and particularly that between Jake (Robert de Niro) and Vicky (Cathy Moriaty).<br/><br/>It's all in context, though, and realistically portrays the culture of New York of the 1940s and 1950s. Anyway, for today's younger audience, it's no big deal, that's for sure, to hear such language all the time, just about anywhere now.<br/><br/>Jake, as many know, was a hard-headed man: hard in the ring, and hard on his women (and men) with whom he dealt. So, yes, there is much domestic violence that serves as a mirror for the violence that continues in the ring; and where Jake can obviously work off a lot of that anger, a dominant aspect throughout the story, together with Jake's insecurities that feed his jealousies. Robert de Niro is probably the only actor at that time who could have performed the role. So, like Casablanca (1942), Citizen Kane (1941), Hud (1963) and a few others, I wouldn't expect anybody to ever attempt a remake of this masterpiece.<br/><br/>Mention must be made of Joe Pesci as Jake's brother, Joey, and his manager for much of his boxing career. Joe Pesci is so natural and powerful an actor, I think he is the only one, I think, who can steal a scene from de Niro. For example, have a look at Goodfellas (1990), one of the greatest gangster flicks ever made (from Scorsese, again).<br/><br/>Back to The Bull, however...<br/><br/>The rest of the supporting cast is without fault. The photography – black and white, my favorite – editing and sound are superb; and the sound track with much classical music is the cherry on top (for me).<br/><br/>For an interesting comparison, try Somebody Up There Likes Me (1956) with Paul Newman portraying Rocky Graziano, another middleweight fighter who was a contemporary of Jake LaMotta's. It's almost amazing to me that the two fighters never had a bout together, but they both fought – and lost – against the same man: Sugar Ray Robinson, still the only fighter to win world welter and middle weight titles. Robinson, for the record, is also still regarded as the greatest boxer of all time (so far).<br/><br/>Even more interesting is that, according to one online source, Jake LaMotta and Rocky Graziano were boyhood friends and both spent time at the same correctional facility.<br/><br/>I recommend Raging Bull as the better, and more gritty movie, but Paul Newman's effort still stands up to scrutiny.<br/><br/>May 14, 2011"
"mjneu59","10","3","5","27 December 2010"," an unflinching portrait, superlative in every way
","There are boxing movies, and then there's the film that may well prove to be director Martin Scorsese's masterpiece; a tough call, given the level of excellence throughout his career. It may or may not be, as many critics have claimed, the best Hollywood feature of the 1980s(actually, it was released in the last year of the 1970s), but the visceral impact of the film is undeniable. Some people may (understandably) not see many virtues in a biography of middleweight champ Jake LaMotta, a man so filled with violence and jealousy that he tormented everyone, including himself, both in and out of the ring. But through Scorsese's fluid direction and Robert De Niro's intense (almost frightening) performance a portrait emerges of a beast who, beneath the rage, is at least halfway human, if never entirely sympathetic. It may not be a pretty picture (despite the stunning black and white photography and Oscar winning editing), but it's certainly a powerful one. Surprisingly, De Niro himself wrote the (uncredited) final, decisive draft of what, before, was a trouble-prone (for obvious reasons) screenplay."

","The movie starts with Jake LaMotta ogling Vicki at the pool in the heavenly sunshine while at the same time pleading with his brother Joey to look out for Jake's high moral standards. The movie ends with Jake asking his estranged brother's forgiveness in the dark recesses of a parking garage. I, like many viewers found Jake's carnal nature amusing the first time I watched this movie. However, on second viewing, isn't what makes the movie great is that it is also about Jake being manipulated by his brother Joey who tries to control Jake by setting Jake up with his wife Vicki and sells out Jake's high moral intentions by asking Jake to throw a fight? To me this movie is not just about love carnal, but Jake accepting his role in his depravity and asking and accepting forgiveness from whom might be considered the enemy of his moral standard. Jake finds eternal love. He's a contender!"

A lot has been said and written about Robert De Niro's performance and yeah, it really is that good. He completely immerses himself into the role and at times you forget your watching an actor playing a part, Robert De Niro IS Jake La Motta. The supporting cast is also very strong especially Joe Pesci in one of his early roles. Scorcese pulls no punches in his depiction of the boxer, he is a loathsome, hateful and selfish man but you can't help but feel a little sorry for him when you see him at the end with his bloated self. The black and white cinematography was also excellent, it really is hard to fault a movie this good."

","Raging Bull (1980)<br/><br/>A serious, black and white look at the complicated truth of Italian American middleweight boxer, Jake La Motta. It's a boxing movie, for sure, and the boxing scenes are riveting and offputting in their violence, but it's purposeful violence, and part of the bigger picture.<br/><br/>The real story is the rise and fall, if you can call it that, of a man. He happened to have a gift for boxing, but it could be anyone with talent who faces a corrupt world and once, just once, weakens. There are other stories that have parallels to this, certainly, from Body and Soul (1947) to Rocky (1976). And of course The Wrestler (2008) has a different sport but same fall from glory. All of these films are excellent in their own ways, and Raging Bull keeps up with the best of them. Certainly Robert De Niro, as La Motta, is astonishing in his range, covering a couple decades and gaining some serious weight toward the end, and Joe Pesci backs him up beautifully.<br/><br/>The filming in any Martin Scorsese movie is significant, and director of photography Michael Chapman keeps the dramatic light and clean use of focus (and lack of focus) in great balance. The sound is complex and interesting (both with added sounds and intrinsic ones). But most of all the story itself, with a vivid believability, is what grips you. I'm not really comfortable with boxing (I guess people can do what they want in that regard), and so a movie about boxing that gets as rough as this one does has me cringing sometimes, even more than with most Tarantino hyper-violence. But that's part of the point. A relentless, engrossing work."

","The ""Raging Bull"" (1980), directed by Martin Scorsese, is a life story. A life story with a lesson. In this film, Actor Robert De Niro, plays the character Jake La Motta. La Motta is an up and coming boxer who lives in New York. He is accompanied by his coach, and brother Joey who is played by Joe Pesci. This movie depicts La Motta's boxing career and the ups and downs along the way. Throughout the movie Jake is troubled by his aggressiveness and insecurities. His insecurities lead him to think his wife, Vickie La Motta, is being unfaithful to him which causes large amounts of tension throughout this film.<br/><br/>The theme of this movie may come off as just another boxing movie, but in fact it is so much more. As stated before La Motta was troubled by his aggressiveness and insecurities. While in some ways these helped his career and made him a successful fighter, in the end it caught up with him. La Motta later loses everything that is close and dear to him by abusing the relationships he had with others. The movie Smokin' Aces (2006), basically has this same type of theme. Only instead of a boxer, it is a magician, Buddy Israel, played by Jeremy Piven whose life is on a downward spiral as a result of his destructive behavior.<br/><br/>The abusive way in La Motta treats his wife, Vickie, both mentally and physically, ruins their relationship which in turn, leads to her taking the kids and leaving him. The way he controlled her and interrogated her with allegations of being unfaithful was the fuel for the fire, so to speak. La Motta didn't have many friends, but his brother Joey was always by his side. For the longest time his brother was, for the most part, a bystander to the abuse Jake dealt to others. Until one day La Motta confronts Joey and accuses him of sleeping with Vickie. Whether he did or didn't really made no difference. Jake already had his mind made up that everyone was sleeping with his wife. This argument, lead La Motta over to Joeys house where Jake physically assaults his brother. This fight was the last straw between La Motta and his brother. Jake and his brother Joey, were no longer on speaking terms.<br/><br/>After losing everyone who is near and dear to him. La Motta continues on his downward spiral. He fails to become a world champion by throwing fights and being self destructive. Instead of being successful he becomes what he calls himself, a bum, working as a comedian at a local night club.<br/><br/>The cinematic effects of the movie are only heightened by the use of black and white coloring. It adds a dramatic effect to the scenes throughout the film, and also showed the darkness surrounding La Motta down his path of destruction. In addition to film format, the camera angles and sounds only added indefinitely to the realism of the fight scenes. The scenes were so real, and graphic, it's as if you were there. It is this realism, in addition to the great storyline of this movie, that resulted in winning two Oscars, among many other prestigious awards."
"Science_Fantasy_Guy","10","3","5","30 April 2009"," Scorsese's most magnificent achievement.
","In 1980, Martin Scorsese and his frequent leading man Robert De Niro re-teamed to craft Raging Bull, a film masterpiece that chronicles the career and decline of boxer Jake La Motta, a '50s Middleweight Champion of the World, who was as violent and angry outside the ring as he was inside it. Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the uncommercial appeal of its subject matter (how can we sympathize with such an unlikable man?) and that at the box office 1980 was owned by The Empire Strikes Back, Raging Bull flopped but its creators still deservedly received vast critical acclaim. This was what saved it from going under, and fortunately it has now become a must-see classic.<br/><br/>Based on La Motta's autobiography Raging Bull: My Story (which De Niro famously brought to Scorsese's attention while the latter was recovering in hospital due to a cocaine addiction), Raging Bull opens in 1964, by which time La Motta was in retirement and trying to make a successful career change as a stand-up comic. Through his younger brother Joey (Joe Pesci), Jake meets Vickie (Cathy Moriarty), a stunning 15-year-old girl who he falls madly in love with and marries. But Jake's extreme volatility comes to the fore many times, eventually destroying his relationships with Vickie and Joey. Also, his uncontrollable appetite is the spark that sets off his decline in strength and thus his decline in successful bouts. By the end he is a broken figure who doesn't know what to do with himself or how to get back what he lost. La Motta may be deeply unlikable, but the film doesn't try to glamourize him or make him a typical Hollywood hero: rather, Marty and Bobby have produced a film showing how a well-known man's soul can be destroyed by his celebrity status and the personal demons he has which he can't overcome.<br/><br/>In De Niro, Pesci and Moriarty we have one of the very finest screen trios ever assembled. It's very hard to know where to begin when describing De Niro's powerhouse performance here. The much-documented enormous weight gain he put himself through to play Jake certainly helped him to the extent that he hoped it would – he's flawless in every scene. Going seamlessly from anger to ferocity in the ring to lust and sexual frustration – often in the space of just one scene – De Niro nails each of Jake's deep complexities, and the end result is a performance that's scary, authoritative and towards the end even very moving (the wall-beating scene is arguably Bobby's finest hour). Not to be outdone, Pesci brings a great deal of heart to the younger, smarter and more self-controlled Joey, and Moriarty gives one of the best female supporting performances of all time as Jake's blonde bombshell trophy wife Vickie. Mardik Martin and Paul Schrader's gritty screenplay gets to the core of these characters brilliantly.<br/><br/>As Marty went into making Raging Bull whilst recovering from a cocaine overdose he was inspired to put his blood, sweat and tears into it in case it was his last movie. And boy, did he. Apart from coaxing those towering performances out of his three main stars, Scorsese summons all the creative talents at his command to create a film of lasting visual wonders as well as emotional power. This is especially evident in the grand boxing sequences, where Michael Chapman's cinematography is so effective you can nearly smell the fighters' sweat and feel the heat and tension inside the ring. Thelma Schoonmaker's editing is so fast but fluid that you can feel every punch that's thrown. With these sequences in particular Scorsese showcases the full artistic force of cinema at its most grand.<br/><br/>Raging Bull was a labor of love for both De Niro and Scorsese, and it shows. They could just as easily have done the opposite and made a boxing movie along the lines of the Rocky series, showing a underdog fighter becoming champion of the world and inspiring the masses. But like true rebels, they did the opposite for a boxing movie – they told the story of a violent man with a desire to be the best who rises to the top but then crashes and burns without really learning anything along the way. Thematically Raging Bull is an eternally tragic and resonant story of how our personal demons can destroy us and also of how society throws celebrities away sometimes within the blink of an eye, and technically it is the stuff that consistently takes your breath away. All in all, a definitive masterpiece. Unforgettable."
"Pistolpete332010","Null","3","5","26 July 2008"," A Masterpiece; Raging Bull Will Floor You
","Raging Bull is the epitome of a masterpiece on every single imaginable level. I can't do anything other then rave about how brilliant the film is. Martin Scorsese's captures the feel of the 40's and 50's, and directs some of the best boxing films to ever grace the big screen. Robert De Niro is brilliant, Joe Pesci is excellent as the boxer/mentor to Jake Lamotta. The rest of the cast is great. This movie will knock you out of your seat. The intro is probably one of the best beginnings to any film. Incredibly poignant scene of Jake Lamotta gracefully dancing around the ring as big bold letters of Raging Bull appear on the top right of the screen.<br/><br/>When it comes to Raging Bull, there really isn't anything bad to say about it. It's a in-depth character study of an intense, aggressive, jealous, sexually frustrated man who causes great pain to those around him. Everything from the script, to what Martin Scorsese turned into a brilliantly, sometimes hauntingly, depiction of a middleweight fighter is done so perfectly. It's no wonder that Raging Bull jumped about 20 spots to land as the 4th greatest American film ever made. It's arguably the best, and it's certainly De Niro, Pesci, and Scorsese at their most magical moment together. 10/10"
"st-shot","10","3","5","30 March 2008"," Scorsese and Di Nero's unbeatable one-two punch.
","Robert Di Nero wins his Oscar early and often as Jake Lamotta in Martin Scorcese's bio of the former middleweight boxing champion, Raging Bull. Di Nero pulls no punches as he gives one of the most unsympathetic portrayals of an actual living person ever shown on screen. From the buff middleweight in his prime to a punchy nite club entertainer Di Nero delivers the most brutal male performance in American film since Brando's Stanley Kowalski in Streetcar. <br/><br/>La Motta, an up and coming boxer is finding it hard to get a title shot by not paying respect to local mob figures. Possessing a volcanic temper and more than a hint of paranoia he is incapable of settling any matters without his fists. Violent both inside and outside the ring he slowly erodes the loyalty of his wife and manager brother with his paranoid outbursts and physical beatings. Never has a fighter been more deserved of his nick name than this raging bull.<br/><br/>Providing a magnificent stage for this uncaged animal, Martin Scorsese is unrelenting in his depiction of La Motta and the ""sweet science"". Moving and jabbing with slow mo and jump cut he vividly conveys the brutality of the sport so graphically that it could make the case for its abolishment. In color it would be unwatchable. In the skillful hands of Scorsese though it becomes blood drenched poetry. From the Cavalara Rusticana serenading of La Motta shadow boxing, tightly edited fight scenes depicting the fury, to his meticulous detail of flesh and fluids Scorsese moves his film along gracefully as well as with force. The tracking shot that follows Jake from his dressing room to the center of the ring for his title fight against Marcel Cerdan is one of his best not only in terms of logistics but also in the story lines eb and flow. It is the moment that La Motta has been waiting for his entire career and Scorsese beautifully allows the audience to be part of his entourage in this crowning moment. Scorsese also skillfully utilizes sound as a smooth transitional device. His use of ambient noise from tenements and the local pool as Jake pursues future wife Vicki counterpoints La Motta's ring roar confidence and momentarily softens him in this toned down arena.<br/><br/>Joe Pesci as his manager brother and Cathy Moriarty as wife Vicki both offer splendid support as they hold their own in every scene with Di Nero. Battered but tough in their own way they soldier on as long as they can with the impossible Jake whose biggest fight remains with himself.<br/><br/>This is the best of all Scorsese/Di Nero teamings and probably the best work they ever did individually. It is a tough watch that may have you checking yourself for bruises and blood splatter as you leave the theatre but their is no denying its mesmerizing form and brilliant performance. Raging Bull is a winner by unanimous decision."

","Raging Bull, perhaps Martin Scorsese's first fully mature film, sees him taking on a similar task to that of Orson Welles when he made Citizen Kane  that is, to take a very public figure and strip away the layers of myth, hype and stereotyping to reveal the human being. In this case, Scorsese set himself the great challenge of creating something poignant and lyrical out of the harsh and violent life of a professional boxer.<br/><br/>As with Citizen Kane (and Lawrence of Arabia, and many other great biopics), Scorsese begins his story with the end result  what La Motta eventually became  then resets to the beginning of his career, and eventually coming full circle. It was probably with this picture Scorsese discovered his forte for the biopic or real-life picture. It's not generally acknowledged, but round about half of Scorsese's features after Raging Bull would either be biographies or at least based upon real events and characters. It was this goal of telling an unknown story and revealing the real person that drove these pictures, and it began here with Raging Bull.<br/><br/>As I said, the job was particularly difficult here  it's not easy to create a sympathetic portrait of a paranoid, short-tempered, misogynist brute, but Scorsese appears to have managed it, perhaps more through technique than anything else. First of all, this is Scorsese at his most subjective. There are numerous point-of-view shots, but they are not just there to show what a character is looking at. Scorsese uses his own blend of expressionist techniques  slow motion, blocking out parts of the sound track and emphasising others  to show state of mind. A good example is La Motta's predatory ogling of Vicky the first time he lays eyes on her. Many of these techniques he perfected in Taxi Driver, but equally important in his development up to this point is 1977's New York New York, the most overlooked of Scorsese's pictures. In New York New York Scorsese became more adept with the musical elements of his films  you can see that from opening credits, where he slows down De Niro's aggressive posturing to fit the music until it comes to resemble ballet more than boxing. New York New York gave Scorsese more confidence in telling a story that spans several years, and how to make transitions that convey that passage of time.<br/><br/>Of course the fight scenes are the heart of Raging Bull, and they are real tour-de-forces of technique. Scorsese's policy of keeping the camera in the ring and thus keeping the audience inside the experience of the fight was probably in part influenced by Hitchcock's silent boxing drama The Ring (1928), but I'm also very much reminded of a very different film, The Red Shoes. The Red Shoes, one of Scorsese's favourite films, features an extended ballet sequence in which the camera is inside the performance on the stage, and it is has that similar effect of putting us in the performers shoes. Having said all that, probably the greatest contributor to the Raging Bull fights was editor Thelma Schoonmaker (who coincidentally later married Red Shoes director Michael Powell), since its that editing  not just of the fighters but split second flashes of spectators, cameras and the bell  that has the most impact here. Schoonmaker rightly won an Oscar for her efforts.<br/><br/>As for the actors, well, for my money Robert De Niro is not a great actor, merely a good one. To be honest I think he mostly attracts attention by the lengths he goes to in preparation for a role, learning professional boxing and getting fat on pasta for Raging Bull being perhaps the most extreme example. More interesting here is the discovery of Joe Pesci. He's one of the few really great character actors of modern cinema, and everything a character actor should be. Cathy Moriarty is also very good as Vicky, and it's a mystery to me why she more or less disappeared as a major actor after this.<br/><br/>Raging Bull is an impressive film, one of the later landmarks of the biopic genre, as well being the last word on boxing movies (although sadly they went on making Rocky sequels all the same). It also revitalised Scorsese's career and launched those of several previously unknown actors. It's not the most watchable of Scorsese's pictures but is one of his most significant."
"Howlin Wolf","10","3","5","30 May 2007"," What do you do with a bull? You get him in the ring...
","It seems fairly self-evident to me, but at least one review I've read has tried to write otherwise: This isn't a boxing movie. We see a few fights, but the result that goes into the record books isn't as important as the mental toll taken by the running battles waged outside the ring. What it's implied that boxing meant to Jake La Motta is a release of all the pent up frustration and insecurities that destroy his relationships. Pugilism is a healthy, controlled outlet for his anger, but remove him from that sporting environment and he's as dangerous as a bull would be if it began roaming the streets...<br/><br/>It is entirely likely that there are no excuses to explain the development of such a man. Perhaps the best thing to do when you realise you have a time-bomb on your hands is to try to plot the path which will cause least destruction, channeling that force and at least putting it to some kind of purpose. Gaining admiration for such a volatile personality probably wasn't high on the list of priorities going into production. It's a despairing situation to document, but an unflinching and fascinating one at that. This is raw celluloid power, restrained for our study as best as can be done."

","After Martin Scorsese finally won an academy award for directing the Hong Kong remake of ""Infernal Affairs"" called ""The Departed,"" this reviewer decided to watch one of Scorsese's known classics. That title was ""Raging Bull."" Is the movie as good as many people have been calling it? Is it overrated? Read this review and find out.<br/><br/>""Raging Bull"" is based off of Jack LaMotta's autobiography called ""Raging Bull: My Story."" This movie focuses on the life and career of boxer Jake LaMotta. Jake's rage and violence made him nearly unstoppable in the boxing ring. Unfortunately, that same anger also drives Jake to beat his wife and his brother Joey and ultimately sends Jake down a self-destructive spiral of paranoia and rage.<br/><br/>""Raging Bull"" is an amazing film. Everything about this film just screams classic. Scorsese decision to shoot the film in black and white was genius. It is a shame that it is rare to see a modern day film shot in black and white. Thelma Schoonmaker, who edited many of Scorsese's films, edited this film fabulously, especially during the boxing scenes. What makes the movie so great is that it is not just a boxing movie, like ""Rocky,"" but also a study of humanized flaws created by their own insecurities.<br/><br/>The acting in this film is fantastic. The acting is some of the best this reviewer has seen. Of course, everybody will be talking about Robert De Niro's performance, as Jack LaMotta, and it is for good reason. Another solid performance was from Joe Pesci as Jack's brother, and manager, Joey. The most underrated, and surprising, performance was from, only nineteen years of age at the time, Cathy Moriaty as Vicky.<br/><br/>Overall, if you want to watch one of the best movies of all time, go check this out. If you are looking for a ""Rocky"" clone, just re-watch ""Rocky"" again. Martin Scorsese definitely was robbed, as far as an academy award, and it is a shame because this is a fantastic film. See this film; you will probably not be disappointed. ""Raging Bull"" is top-notch film-making. ""Raging Bull"" is extremely recommended!"
"lmayer2","10","3","5","28 February 2007"," Scorsese's heart and soul rolled into one film
","When you have an already top-notch director (like Martin Scorsese) who wants to put it all into one film because it may be his very last, you have a classic, which has been made with the director's heart and soul. Because of Scorsese's fatal drug addiction, he didn't expect much more and he didn't expect to get back on track. While making Raging Bull while he suffered from the addictions, he was more than on track and he was more than on top of the game. Scorsese put on a master work as he skillfully developed enough will and strength to make Raging Bull, in the top 100 here at IMDb. This is a crown jewel, which really reminds me of Scarface (mainly because of the swearing) however, this was more meaningful than Scarface. You can't have everything when you're worried about everything. Raging Bull teaches us how easily we fall into the snares we originally set up for ourselves and how easily we fall prey to our own disasters. Scorsese has put on a lot of great films over the years and I'm looking for many more to follow from his directing. Raging Bull, I would have to say, was his best film yet if you take into account all the factors. Keep in mind, Scorsese was in a different mindset. Everyone is when thy're on drugs and I'm sure he couldn't function as well as someone he wasn't on drugs but we saw perfection from Raging Bull. We see Scorsese was also determined to prove something, to overcome the insurmountable odds that were stacked against him. However, people function better when backed into the corner. Regardless, this is still a great film, whether it be Scorsese's greatest of all time or not and we can still appreciate it regardless of how it was directed and made on."
"j_dogg6901","10","3","5","27 February 2007"," The best boxing movie EVER!!
","Jake La Motta's life is told through Martin Scorsese's boxing masterpiece. Coming off De Niro and Scorsese's brilliant Taxi Driver, Raging Bull is possibly the best boxing movie ever made. Yes, it is better than Rocky! While Rocky had considerable flare and was a very good movie overall, it can't hold up to the brilliant portrayal of La Motta and his rise to fame. Raging Bull puts both of the (more than solid) new films Million Dollar Baby and Cinderella Man to shame. These movies (including Rocky) may depict boxing more realistically but then again that's part of the beauty of Raging Bull - it's rough and unpolished...making it that much more realistic overall. Joe Pesci is the perfect counterpart to De Niro - taking considerable burdens off De Niro and letting him craft La Motta in a way not seen in today's movies. How De Niro managed to transform himself as much as he did in this movie is a mystery to me, but it is further proof of his brilliance."
"lee_eisenberg","10","3","5","19 April 2006"," You talking' to him?
","In one of their many collaborations, Martin Scorsese directed Robert DeNiro in ""Raging Bull"", about self-destructive 1940s boxer Jake LaMotta. The way that DeNiro gets into the role is almost beyond belief. The viewer understands that LaMotta was an angry lunatic, but can't help but sympathize with him. Still, we can see how his jealousy ruined him: if he even saw a man touch his wife Vickie (Cathy Moriarty), he would explode, seeing the situation as a threat to his machismo. It's impressive how DeNiro gained all that weight to play the older LaMotta of reduced status. Equally as intense as DeNiro as Joe Pesci as Jake's brother Joey, who had his own problems.<br/><br/>All in all, I don't think that anyone can deny that DeNiro deserved Best Actor for this movie. Watching it, you feel like you just got your face pounded in by LaMotta himself. Was this DeNiro's and Scorsese's best collaboration ever? Hard to say, since they had so many great ones. But ""Raging Bull"" is certainly up there. It's an experience that you'll never forget. And believe me, you shouldn't forget it, because this is a great movie.<br/><br/>Anyone feel like boxing now?"
"pyrocitor","10","3","5","5 March 2006"," Although he could fight, he'd much rather recite... that's entertainment
","Don't be misled into thinking that Raging Bull is simply a film about boxing, à-la Rocky. It does indeed focus on the life of a boxer, but there is so much more to it then that. Rather than simply being a sports story of redemption, or something of the like, Raging Bull is one of the most startling and powerful portraits of stunted machismo ever captured on film. De Niro, following up on other such personas of tough guy losers, gives arguably his strongest performance here as Jake La Motta, who slowly but surely tore down everything he had managed to accumulate around him, including a marriage, relationships with all those close to him, and his hard won boxing career. De Niro is clearly the center of attention here, and he lives up to his reputation with wonderful flair, his performance is one of the most deserving of his Oscar in history. <br/><br/>But don't go thinking this is a one man show, although De Niro's electrifying performance is easily the highlight of the movie, once again, there's so much more to it then that. For one thing, the technical genius of director Martin Scorsese, whose bold decision to shoot the film in black and white paid off immensely, giving the film a stark, bold look, almost like an old photograph, lost in the depths of time. It's really a shame more movies aren't shot in black and white these days, in today's colour saturated world, the occasional flash devoid of colour can come as quite the relief. <br/><br/>The legendary fight scenes are also incredible, with Scorsese determined to get his cameras directly in the middle of the action, instead of simply watching from a distance. We as an audience genuinely seem to feel every bone jarring punch, which really helps us sympathize with La Motta, rather than creating an antagonist out of the character. In fact, one of the most praiseworthy aspects of the film is Scorsese's ability to maintain a completely balanced view of the character, never taking sides to present him as a hero or a villain - a flawed lead in all cases. Even at times of spousal abuse and such, when we are genuinely meant to hate the character, we still realize exactly what in La Motta's troubled psyche is making him do such a thing, and still, somehow manage to empathize with the character. <br/><br/>Although the film really does belong to De Niro, he is ably supported by numerous similarly phenomenal supporting performances. Joe Pesci gives a terrific performance as La Motta's brother who also falls prey to Jake's increasing paranoia and aggression. The scene between Jake and Joey with Jake continually challenging his brother to hit him as hard as he can is one of the most powerful in the movie. Cathy Moriarty is also memorable as La Motta's 15 year old trophy girlfriend, who, even though at one point being the one person he could trust, also finds herself pushed away by the boxer's growing distrust of everyone. These two fantastic performances provide excellent backup for the incredible De Niro.<br/><br/>All in all, it seems fair to say Raging Bull is one of the most powerful and well made films in film history - with Martin Scorsese establishing himself as a master director, and Robert De Niro giving an astonishingly affecting performance, perhaps the strongest of his career, driving the stunted machismo mood of the film home. Definitely worth seeing, if you have yet to do so! <br/><br/>-10/10"

On top of this you have quite possibly the greastest acting performance from an American icon in the history of film, and the perfect interesting character and story to boot. No movie can ever touch Raging Bull. Period. Truly a Masterpiece. The definitive work of the Great Martin Scorsese. Not to mention Pesci and DeNiro. The fact that this film did not take home the best picture nomination is an abomination to society equal to that of the holocaust in my eyes. The academy snubbed Scorsese once again, maby it is because they are afraid of the fact that he tells stories that depict characters realistically, characters that are pieces of *#^$, and that beat their wives, or sell drugs, or kill people. They are afraid of the fact that he is not a big fat wet Hollywood pus$$y. I am not saying that he supports any of the aforementioned activities, I am simply saying that he is not afraid to depict people of this nature, people who happen to be incredibly interesting."

","(There Are Spoilers) Unlike most professional prize-fighters who keep their aggressions inside of the boxing-ring and outside of it would rather walk away from a fight then participate or provoke one boxer, and later Middleweight Champion,Jake La Matta, Robert Di Niro, was the exact opposite. <br/><br/>Brutal rude petty and jealous and combative of anyone who as much as looked at his pretty wife Vickie, Cathy Moriarty, La Matta did more fighting outside the ring then in it. Fighting his way up the ranks to get a shot at the title 20 year-old La Matta is defeated for the first time in his career on September 24, 1941 in Cleveland after he knocked his opponent Jimmy Reeves, Flyod Anderson, out cold. Reeves was saved from being counted out by the bell and was declared the winner which started a full-scale riot in the Cleveland arena. <br/><br/>Quickly recovering from his loss La Matta went on to defeat the undefeated Sugar Ray Robinson (Johnny Barnes), who bet La Matta twice before,on February 26, 1943 in a 10 round decision in Detroit, Robinson's home town. Assured that he'd get a shot at the Middleweight Title LaMatta had to wait some six years, and throw a fight to journeyman boxer Billy Fox(Eddie Mustafa Muhammad) in New York on November 11, 1947,to get it.<br/><br/>The movie ""Raging Bull"" concentrates more on Jake LaMatta's personal then professional boxing life and we see just what kind of a Neanderthal and brute he was to the people he came in contact with especially his wife Vickie and younger brother Joey, Joe Pesci.Suffering from an inferior complex and afraid that Vickie would leave him for another man, like he left his first wife for Vickie,La Matta constantly beat and berated Vickie to the point of not just slapping her around but catching Vickie flush right in the face with one of his punches that knocked her out.<br/><br/>Even Joey wasn't speared from Jake's brutality and suspicions of fooling around with Vickie when he savagely attacked and bet him, right in front of Joey's wife and children. This lead Joey to never talk to Jake again until almost ten years later. La Matta finally got a shot at the title on June 16, 1949 in Detroit and defeated the Middleweight Champ Frenchman Marcel Cerdan, Louis Raftis, when he couldn't answer the bell for the 10th round.<br/><br/>Defending his hard won title a year later against fellow Frenchman Laurent Dauthuille (Johnny Turner), Cerdan died in a plane crash before his re-match with La Matta,on September 13, 1950 in NYC Jake was about to lose the fight on points. It's then that he exploded with a fury of punches in the 15th round and knocked out Dauthuille with only 13 seconds left in the fight.<br/><br/>For all intents and purposes Jake La Matta's boxing career ended, he official retired in 1954, on February 14, 1951, known in the boxing world as the St. Valentine Day massacre. It's then when he fought and lost his Middleweight crown to his arch-rival Sugar Ray Robinson in a brutal 13 round battle. La Matta bloodied and beaten was still standing on his feet when the fight was stopped by the ring referee.<br/><br/>No longer able to box professionally La Matta opened up a nightclub, the Jake La Matta, in Miami Florida but trouble still followed him. La Matta was busted on a vice rap, that landed him in the Dade County Jail. This happened when he allowed a 14 year-old girl Mary Albee, who told LaMatta that she was 21, drink at his club and then introduced her to a number of his friends.<br/><br/>The movie ""Raging Bull"" ends in NYC in 1964 with a pudgy and punch-drunk Jake La Matta, alone with everyone that he knew in his hay-day as a boxing champ deserting him, rehearsing his nightclub act which is nothing more then a parody of his life. An amazing Acadamy Award performance by Robert Di Niro as the edgy and uncontrollable Jake La Matta who had to gain some 50 pounds, going from a fighting trim of 165 to over 200 lbs, to make the role of Jake La Matta believable. <br/><br/>The film ""Raging Bull"" also made a star out of the 36 year-old Joe Pesci who was about to call it quits on his acting career until Robert Di Niro himself demanded that he play his tragic, and somewhat unusable, brother Joey."

It was probably one of the most predictable Academy Awards ever that year, because Robert De Niro just blew everyone else away. Joe Pesci brings us another amazing performance. Martin Scorsese's directing is near perfect, and we are treated to great black and white cinematography. Basically everything about this movie had ""OSCAR"" stamped on its forehead.<br/><br/>Although ""Raging Bull"" is, in a technical sense, one of the greatest movies ever made, it fails to entertain on all levels. There are many moments in the movie that are incredibly entertaining, however, there are some moments where it just seems to be too slow-paced. I am usually all for slow-paced movies, as it helps to build up the plot and the characters, but I feel that ""Raging Bull"" could have been cut short 15 or 20 minutes and it would have been more entertaining, and still just as great when it comes to all the technical aspects.<br/><br/>Sum-up: If you are looking for some of the best acting you will ever see, look no further than ""Raging Bull.""

The film in black n white works well, Robert De Niro gives an awsome and memorable performance as troubled boxer Jake LaMotta and gains 50 pounds along the way to play the older Lamotta and easily deserved the best actor Oscar that year for his work.

There is strong support from Joe Pesci (always good to watch) as Jake's brother Joey and Cathy Moriarty who plays Jake's beautifull long suffering wife Vickie in her film debut, its hard to believe she was just 18 at the time. And what can you say about Martin Scorsese the guy is simply a genius and it is possible that he has directed the best film of 3 decades.

","When reviewing american films from the past twenty to thirty years there is no doubt that Raging Bull is a standout amongst standouts.  It is a film that encompasses every embodiment of motion picture art. The film is fueled with unbelievably dazzling editing (the best possibly ever!) and uncomprimizing performances (the same can be said) and unblinkingly focused direction by Martin Scorsese, who is undeniably the best american director working today. Raging Bull is the best movie made in quite sometime (especially since its release in 1980), and there are very few movies that can begin to scatch the surface of what it totally reveals.

","I watched this movie because it was highly recommended and was an award winner, and because I love boxing movies, especially Rocky and Cinderella Man. What a mistake. The only thing I enjoyed about this was the actual boxing scenes, especially the one with Sugar Ray Leonard. The scenes were too short and never showed a whole fight. The story was choppy and hard to follow. And just when you thought the movie should end, it kept dragging on and on and had no defining climax or resolution. Then all of a sudden it just stopped. Very poor film-making in my opinion, and not worthy of any awards. This film was basically plot less. It would be as if you took two arbitrary points in my life and chose to make a movie about the time in between. There's no plot, it builds up to nothing, there is no climax, no final resolution, nothing at all to indicate that the end is coming. The movie just starts, and then it stops later. There's no completion, no story, no sense that it is building up to something. This would be one star if it wasn't for the amazing boxing footage.<br/><br/>See my profile for my rating philosophy."
"batmanorgiants","6","4","8","23 November 2019"," Sigh
","I came into this movie with high expectations and I was just left with a sad, depressing story that meandered to the point where Cathy leaves Jimmy and Joey stops talking to him as well. Jimmy is supposed to be a unlikable, insecure jerk but there is no true defining moment to me where I can find something endearing to Jimmy's character. I love movies with flawed characters: clockwork orange, good fellas, Taxi driver, eternal sunshine of the spotless mind, there will be blood, no country for old men, her and etc. But there was something there that made me like or at least be sympathetic to those characters. I'll compare him to Travis, who's also played brilliantly by Robert De Niro, and I would argue at their cores, Travis is a way more despicable character then Jimmy. But Scorsese's directing really elevates the point of view Travis has of the filth in New York. His failings with romantic and friendship relationships is relatable and it adds another interesting characteristic of Travis. Travis is a sexist, rude, insecure, PTSD ridden paranoia induced man but I still end up understanding his plan through the end. In Raging Bull, the only nuance to Jimmy's struggles is how he takes his sexual and jealous emotions out on other boxers instead of expressing his feelings in a healthy way to his family. I wanted jimmy to lose every match and I was glad to see Cathy and Joey sees contact from him. Good, let him rot as a fat, drunken bar owner. The reason why this movie isn't ranked lower however Is due to De Niro, Pesci and Moriarty's fantastic performances, Scorsese's masterful directing, the good soundtrack (although I think it was played a bit too obnoxiously in the boxing montages) and the great editing. It's just the script that I hate. It was a bucket list movie and I look forward to never seeing it again."

The film has been beautifully-shot by cinematographer Michael Chapman, utilizing every visual and visceral trick in the cinema manual, and Robert De Niro deservedly won the Best Actor Oscar for his amazing, high-wire performance in the lead--even putting on the extra weight for Jake's latter-day scenes. But the movie is mired in sordidness, and Scorsese clearly relishes rubbing our faces in the dirty laundry. The filmmaker's artistry is undeniably vast, yet he fails to lift his picture up on an emotional level and, very soon, one feels like a boxer in the ring, being pummeled. Thelma Schoonmaker also won an Oscar for her editing, which is amazing in the boxing sequences but, later, when Jake is retired and tries his hand at being a lounge lizard, the scenes are allowed to drag on to an inevitable finish."

This is exactly what should be brought up to Stallone's face every time to remind him that it is wrong to not care about the point of directing good movies, and it's a shame this movie rarely gets talked about when it comes to De Niro's career. Mostly now all you hear is the Godfather (more like godly boring) and Heat, which aren't very good movies. But Raging Bull even if Scorcese doesn't convince you with his picture, cinematography and filming, provides some really good actors. Everyone acts well, and you see the progression that sounds natural, Jake drives them all nuts and his destiny can only be a major downfall.

It is a brutally charged bio regarding inner rage and personal destruction. True story of boxer Jake La Motta who struggled to obtain a championship title shot. He expresses himself through anger, rage and brute force. His brother and manager knows his anger all too well as well as his second wife whom he met when she was only fifteen. The film displays many forms of anger and violence but none are as frequent than his inability to trust. Among the best boxing footage ever filmed director Martin Scorsese uses black and white to capture the mood. Robert De Niro delivers a powerful performance as a man made a victim to his own distrust. He spent time in prison after his career faded, then he attempted standup comedy. Cathy Moriarty plays his wife who becomes the object of possession. His anger ultimately drives her away after one flash of violence too many. Joe Pesci as his brother becomes the channel for abuse but sees his brother better than anybody. Theresa Saldana appears as Pesci's wife whom he mistreats but she plays off knowing her place. Frank Vincent is also cast as someone connected to the mafia who watches the fights.

"johnnyboyz","8","2","3","5 February 2011"," The film is brutal and brutally honest in equal measure; a terrifically terrifying slice of hard edged drama featuring a number of talents quite arguably at their peak.
","We begin with the titular Raging Bull gearing up before a contest, not one inside of ring but just prior to one of his stage duels in which he takes on the audience telling stories and anecdotes that pull in the crowds and the money. The man is Robert De Niro 's Jake La Motta; it's 1964, and after the brief practising of several lines to himself speaking of how he remembers every hit and every knock down and practically every detail of his in-ring boxing career, we dart back to 1941 to where it all began. With the benefit of hindsight, we're able to recall a number of other characters portrayed by De Niro in other Scorsese films in the form of Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, and the memorable monologues they brought about, before arriving at the conclusion this character we're observing here and now for the first time may very well be as disturbed as the other two in said examples. When La Motta speaks, there's a sense of specificity or intrinsics about the man's verbal confirmation of living his boxing life to the full, and the ability to take in the more minute details of what unravelled in the ring; Martin Scorsese's film eventually coming to resemble an inmost and often distressingly intrinsic study of this man's life from his young adult years to entering old age.<br/><br/>Scorsese doesn't doubt as to whether La Motta was a champion, without Scorsese's film one might champion him as a magnificent physical specimen and a champion athlete, but the manner as to which La Motta went about attaining this reputation, it seems and particularly at one point, sees him mercilessly hammer away at an opponent in a manner fuelled by hallucinations; scociopathic tendencies and mass hysteria that his wife, a long suffering Vickie (Moriarty) 'likes' the man he's fighting. But the film is as much a tale of the man outside of the ring as it is a tale of the man inside; how he came to be as aggressive and ruthlessly efficient as he was and how balancing that duality between an on-stage and off-stage persona through his aggression and anger became blurred and difficult to balance out. Raging Bull's immediate opening is a tranquil, beautiful almost, passage of slow motion as La Motta occupies the ring alone to some angelic music; that sense of it being of the picturesque sort and that La Motta truthfully belonged in the ring amidst everything else comes to feel prominent. In and around the scuzzy living of New York in whatever year, as the loitering with the sorts of people La Motta hangs with features more and more, the locale or space of the boxing ring comes to represent a very harmonious and very magnificent zone in which he totally finds his element and makes his name. It is a place of violence and often bloodshed, to La Motta through Scorsese's eyes, it was a small squared zone in which the lead was at one with himself.<br/><br/>The film covers his life and times, his friends and foes; his wife and her hardships as well as his brother in Joey (Pesci), a man whom appears to be the only one capable of talking any degree of sense into the lead but additionally someone who has his own problems with violence and misogyny. When Jake first sees his wife to be, she's lounging beside a pool on a warm day under the careful watch of some local organised criminals; the very same ones La Motta had previously had a problem with in a local gym and whom verbally illustrate how they dealt with another man whom himself tried to woo young Vickie. La Motta, being the man he is, steps in regardless and thus instigates a relationship through casual small-talk and sessions of mini-golf.<br/><br/>Vickie comes to represent the result of most of Jake's pent up rage, the immense paranoia twinned with gross levels of suspicion constantly threatening to destroy their coming together. At once, I criticised the film previously for not exploring their coming together enough and berated the lack of any substantial material believable enough to force them together. Viewing it again; it seems the film, in all its hostile ugliness, was always more concerned with how it was the lead tore their relationship apart what with his actions than it was ever interested in the stuff that borough them both harmoniously together. It is, however, the two brothers that the film produces some of the more magnificent moments of dialogue and exchange, a telling moment about where Scorsese's chief interests lie in the tale of Jake outside of the ring occurs during an instance in which he kisses his future wife on a date before moving off screen to further embrace. But the camera does not follow as one might expect, instead lingering on the mantle-piece that they were stood in-front of which now occupies the foreground upon which a photo of Joey and Jake together stands. The film here infers that the bond between the two brothers is the strongest of the film, if there is a stone-wall relationship between two people in the film, it is that of Jake and his brother; the reminding it is they whom argue and bicker and squabble like the couple they are.<br/><br/>Raging Bull plays, for mostly all of its runtime, a lot like his 1973 film Mean Streets; the core change pushing it off down a very different framework that there happens to be a prize fighting boxer in and amongst the low-lives of which the film centralises on. The film is both peppered and undercut with a really uneasy sense of both hostility and hatred; Scorsese embedding the piece with a seething anger which you feel might just boil over and explode and any moment whereas the result is something highly substantial in a number of fields and most certainly worthy of seeking out."

","Raging Bull is a film staring Robert Dinero as Jake La Motta, the champion mid-weight fighter of the 1940's through the 1960's. The film shows La Motta's successful boxing career, his struggle to remain uninvolved with the mob, as well as his turbulent relationships with his wife Vickie and brother Joey, played by Cathy Moriarty and Joe Pesci, Jake La Motta brings violence into each aspect of his life, repeatedly abusing Vickie, whom he believes is constantly scheming to be unfaithful to him. This violence and jealousy is most likely caused by Jake's feeling of inadequacy, the underlying theme of the film. <br/><br/>The theme is first introduced in the beginning of the movie in a conversation between Jake and his brother Joey, who is also Jake's manager. Joey is trying to figure out what is wrong with Jake, who had been bullying his first wife just before for no apparent reason. Jake tells Joey that his problem is his hands and that their small size will forever prohibit him from fighting the best boxers, no matter how great he becomes. Another way the theme is portrayed is through Jakes interaction with the mob. Because of the mob's involvement with gambling, they are very interested in Jake. They offer to help him become successful on many occasions. However, Jake knows this help is not in his best interest and the offer only adds to his feelings of inadequacy. He believes he can reach the top on his own. After constantly being denied, the mob boss Salvy, played by Frank Vincent, informs Joey that Jake will never be given a title shot without becoming involved with the mob. Jake finally gives in and throws a match, giving legitimacy to his feelings of inadequacy. He leaves the ring, unharmed, and returns to the locker room in an extremely dramatic scene. <br/><br/>One cinematic technique used to illustrate the theme is the montage of Jake's rise to fame juxtaposed against home footage of his family. The montage places scenes of Jake boxing with seemingly happy domestic scenes such as birthday parties and family gatherings. Although the entire movie is black and white, an effect used to set the mood of the film, the domestic clips in this montage are filmed in color, as if filmed with an old Super-8 camera. Although the footage appears pleasant, it is assumed, because of the juxtaposition with his fighting scenes, that violence has already leaked into Jake and Vickie's marriage, making Jake an inadequate husband. <br/><br/>Another important technique used to show Jake's feelings of inadequacy is through the point of view of the camera. Although the majority of the movie is filmed using an objective point of view, there are several instances using the subjective point of view. Most of these instances are when Jake is watching an interaction between Vickie and another man. Another important technique used during these scenes is the use of slow motion, which makes it seem as though Jake's rage is focused completely on Vickie, despite any other distractions in the room. This shift in the point of view is important because it allows the audience to feel the jealousy and inadequacy Jake feels. An indirect-subjective point of view is also used in filming many of the boxing scenes. This allows the audience to experience the violence and rage felt by Jake that he is only able to fully express while boxing. <br/><br/>Although Raging Bull is filled with violence, violence is not the most important theme in the film. It is the emotions that cause this violence that are important. Through the use of cinematic techniques and well placed dialogue and events, Martin Scorsese allowed an audience to see into the mind of an insecure and paranoid man. These insecurities are what fueled the rage that allowed Jake La Motta to become like a bull in the boxing ring."
"bobsgrock","Null","2","3","5 January 2011"," Such a film cannot be quantified,qualified or completely understood.
","Raging Bull has been viewed by countless people as the greatest American film of the 1980s, even of all time. Seeing it again, it is remarkable to see the precisely choreographed fight scenes, the powerful domestic scenes between Jake LaMotta and his wife and the overall arc of a life Scorsese brings to the screen. This is a film not easily forgotten.<br/><br/>Without discussing the commonly known backstory and history of how Scorsese and De Niro came to make this film, it is important to discuss what Raging Bull targets in its remarkably moving film making. It all begins and ends with Robert De Niro's performance as LaMotta, a ferocious fighter with animal-like instincts that assisted in the boxing ring, but were deadly to his relationships. The most remarkable aspect of De Niro's acting here is how he is able to perfectly capture the pivotal point between LaMotta being sincere and being a bull. Even in scenes we know something harsh and violent is going to happen, the sheer low tone and calm gesture De Niro speaks in is enough to throw off the audience of the impending conflict. It truly is an unforgettable performance.<br/><br/>Able to go face-to-face with De Niro is Joe Pesci as Jake's brother Joey, the brains of the operation and more able to deal with real life, as well as Cathy Moriarty as his blonde bombshell wife Vickie. The fact that she was a mere 19 years old during production enhances her performance even more.<br/><br/>What Martin Scorsese is able to suggest not just about LaMotta but also humanity in general in a film some see merely as a sports film on par with Rocky or Bull Durham is unbelievable. This is not a sports movie, rather a careful character study of a man with infinite psychological and personal issues who attempted to approach every part of life as if it was a boxing match. When this didn't work with Vickie or his boxing representatives, he simply lashed out the only way he understood. Some see Jake LaMotta as almost entirely unsympathetic. I think he is even more sympathetic than most because he doesn't understand the sorrow and turmoil he causes. He acts but doesn't think.<br/><br/>Scorsese, ever a master of the visual tricks and styles, so carefully photographed the fight scenes that they remain immersible in the viewer's head: this is real boxing compared to what is seen in other films. The fighters are completely covered in blood, sweat and water, while the slow-motion shots of certain characters forever marks their spot in our memories. This is a story told almost entirely from LaMotta's point of view, yet it isn't just his story. This is also Scorsese's, the story of a self-destructive man who alienated all of those around him only to lose that which he cherished. Fortunately for Scorsese, he realized his problems and perhaps making this film allowed him to escape a similar fate to LaMaotta."

","'Raging Bull' is an Incredible film, in all respects. It's a Landmark! Martin Scorsese is a Storyteller, that creates inspirations. He cleans every thing, that's the reason why his films never have dust. An Icon, A Legend that pays tribute to the Mardik Martin and Paul Schrader written Jake La Motta memoir Raging Bull: My Story.<br/><br/>'Raging Bull' is a disturbing biopic on Jake La Motta, one of the most controversial people of his time. His highs and lows are so interesting, so confusing and so disturbing. 'Raging Bull' which is widely regarded as a Cult Classic, is a film that carries a lot of respect. Scorsese's direction is, WOW! <br/><br/>Coming to the acting department, Robert De Niro ain't known to be a Legend for no reason. His performance is emotional, so emotional it becomes haunted after a while. Cathy Moriarty is fantastic. Joe Pesci is terrific, he's in sync with his character from start to end.<br/><br/>'Raging Bull' is a must watch for all... this is Cinema! 1,000 Thumbs Up!"

","Unbelievably emotional, brutally blunt, and acting to end all acting. This is the best boxing/sports film/biopic EVER. It is absolutely off-the-chart good. Often under-rated, and so called difficult to love. I honestly cannot see why. DeNiro goes to extreme length to add to the repulsion scale, and Scorsese makes an impact with beautiful classical scores, and black and white shots which somehow seem to be better than what it would have been like in colour. This is better than Rocky and damn provocative. Even the real Jake LaMotta said DeNiro did a better job at portraying himself than he could do. And I can believe it.<br/><br/>For all those who have not seen, see it. And for all those who thought it was horrific to watch, and was therefore a bad film. Watch it again properly. It is brilliant.

"michaelRokeefe","8","2","3","1 June 2002"," No punches pulled. A raw masterpiece.
","It can be debated that this is the best boxing movie of all time. Never the less, Martin Scorsese delivers a masterful story based on Jake LaMotta's book. We get to see the rough, raw and rowdy story of LaMotta's(Robert De Niro)rise to the middleweight championship and his self-destructive exit from the glory and limelight. Great boxing scenes and unabashed emotional acting make this movie the masterpiece it is. De Niro is at the top of his game and probably plays one of his most memorable characters. Cathy Moriarty plays Jake's wife and kudos to Joe Pesci as Joey LaMotta, Jake's brother. Notable support from Nicholas Colasanto and Theresa Sadana. This sad, but triumphant film should not be missed. You get the punch for your bucks with this one."
"Tallgent","Null","2","3","24 April 2000"," Maybe Scorsese's Best Film
","Images frozen for posterity are many in the history of motion pictures, but only a few encompass the film's meaning in that image. Rocky Balboa's running up the Philadelphia stairs is one such example.  Then there is Jake La Motta (Robert De Niro) gracefully shadowboxing in the ring in slow motion while the sad but proud strains of Mascagni's  ""Cavalleria Rusticana"" is playing on the soundtrack.   Brute more than man, La Motta's barbarism finds its truest expression in the ring.  Here to be less than a man is celebrated not despised.  Here La Motta achieves peace.  Peace that comes only in the ring, however.  La Motta brings chaos and despair to his loved ones outside of it.  ""Raging Bull"" charts Jake La Motta's journey toward finding peace outside of his arena.  It is one of the most honest portrayals of redemption ever produced for the screen.<br/><br/>Scorsese teamed up with Paul Schrader, whom he had worked with on the archetypal film ""Taxi Driver,"" to work on the screenplay.  What shows are two storytellers at the top of their craft and Martin Scorsese reaching maturity.<br/><br/>The film opens with a paunchy, out-of-shape, La Motta going over his monologue for the evening's performance.  He recites his trademark rhyme ad dictum:  ""So give me a stage where this Bull here can rage/ And though I can fight, I'd much rather recite...That's entertainment!  That's entertainment.""<br/><br/>Then we flash backward to a healthy, lean, and hungry La Motta in his quest for the Middleweight Title.  Helping him along is his put-upon brother and manager, Joey (Joe Pesci).  La Motta constantly badgers Joey about his wanting to be a heavyweight and having ""small hands.""  To prove that he truly is a man, La Motta provokes Joey into hitting him.  We see that Jake La Motta is insecure about his masculinity.  What reaffirms it in La Motta's are his boxing and abrasive behavior.<br/><br/>One of the most commendable features about the film is the progression of success for La Motta and the regression of his home life.  This escalates when La Motta meets his second wife, Vickie (Cathy Moriarty).  Vickie, as portrayed by Moriarty, is a vision of incredible erotic beauty and this fuels jealousy in La Motta whenever she is around other men.  He loses both his wife and his brother because of his jealousy and insecurity.<br/><br/>If this sounds like a depressing movie it most certainly is.  But one of the points the movie makes is that when a person is at their lowest point, understanding comes, and then the potential for change can happen.  That is where the power of the film lies, not in the self-destructive behavior of La Motta, but in the efforts he takes to save himself.<br/><br/>I mentioned before that Scorsese reached full maturity here.  That maturity comes by way of the care he places in his filmmaking and storytelling.  To Scorsese's credit he does not mince meat (but then again, when has he?) on his subject's repulsiveness.  La Motta is a lout, a creep, insecure, childish, brutal, cruel, but also tender, vulnerable, and human.<br/><br/>I cannot say enough about the hallucinations that make up the boxing scenes. With the film shot almost entirely in black-and-white, the boxing sequences make full effect of the contrast and lighting.  Strange animal noises are heard during the matches, reinforcing the barbaric nature of the contest. When La Motta loses his belt to Sugar Ray Robinson, the Catholicism-drenched Scorsese films it as La Motta's crucifixion.  Robinson raises his fist on high like a passing of judgment.  Finally, La Motta spreads his arms and welcomes the flurry of attacks in surrender, his blood spilling everywhere. After his defeat, La Motta still stands.  ""You didn't knock me down, Ray.""<br/><br/>Joe Pesci went on to become a Scorsese staple after his fine portrayal of Joey La Motta.  Joey suffers at the hands of his brother throughout the film, yet he still stands by him until Jake finally snaps.  But the insecurity and jealousy that fester in Jake make their presence known in Joey as well as he repeatedly slams a car door on one of Vickie's prospective adulterers. <br/><br/>Cathy Moriarty had her first role as the seductive Vickie.  Blonde and beautiful, shy and alluring, the audience can see why La Motta is drawn to this vision and determined to keep her even at the cost of losing her. Moriarty captures Vickie's impending sense of being a prisoner as she becomes quieter and more subservient as a wife than she ever was as La Motta's flirtatious girlfriend.  She also shows strength as a mother as she fights to regain some semblance of sanity for her children.  It is a heartbreaking performance.<br/><br/>De Niro captured the Academy Award for Best Actor as Jake La Motta.  If ever there was a definition for acting in the ""Method,"" De Niro's performance fits the bill.  In his scenes as the retired and gluttonous La Motta, De Niro actually gained 200 pounds.  The only thing prosthetic is his nose.  It is doubtful if an actor will ever go to such pains for a performance again.<br/><br/>I'd have to say that this and ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" are the two most personal films of Scorsese.  He even adds a nice coda from the Bible if there is any doubt to its story of redemption.  ""...Whether this man forgave my sins, I know not.  I only know that once I was blind and now I can see.""<br/><br/>The bull sees. Raging Bull ****"

"genius-15","Null","2","3","13 August 1999"," A Pleasure to Watch
","This is one of the few films worthy of being called a drama. And its probably the most accurate of the ""based on a true story"" genre. Robert DeNiro has yet again proved that he is the finest American actor since Charleton Heston, for he transforms himself into his role (unlike most actors, such as Hoffman, Pacino, and Newman, who merely attempt to imitate) literally becoming the character. It should have won the Oscar for best picture and director, especially since its rivals were so blatantly inferior.<br/><br/>For those who didnt live in New York during the 40s, this film provides some fascinating history. And its black and white filming was an ingenious method of conveying the historical context. But it doesnt end there. The late 1970s New York locations were brilliantly chosen, for anyone who watches actual 1940s film footage of New York can see how closely they resemble each other. The scenes in the boxing ring, neighborhood swimming pool, and of course the spacious nightclub were truly fabulous and nostalgic.<br/><br/>The supporting cast all deserved to win the oscars they were nominated for. Joe Pesci was outstanding in the ""mad mobster"" role he continued in Goodfellas and Casino, and Cathy Moriarty was riveting as Jake's estranged teenage wife. Nicholas Colasanto (""Coach"" from Cheers) definitly deserved an Oscar for his sharp portrayal of Tommy Como, the benevolent mob boss who gives Jake his title shot.

He just makes you sit in front of the screen and not move for about 2 hours, because that's how much he can captivate us in each film he makes. Each scene was so pure and (almost) flawless. But, there is another reason, which brings this film to its greatness and that is the one and only, Martin Scorsese. I feel like this is one of his best work and if not, one of the greatest movies ever to be made.
You might think at first that this is a typical boxing movie, but it ain't nothing like that. The De Niro- Scorsese duo made sure of that. They put their hearts in this particular film, because that's what they do. They make you live with the characters they build and once they do that, there is no turning back. You simply fall in love with their work.
Also, the fact that this film is in black&white simply takes the film to a whole new other level. It is beyond beautiful and mesmerizing to watch.

","Martin Scorsese's supreme artistic masterwork is an extraordinarily compelling motion picture of enormous power and rare distinction. A searing biography of middleweight boxing champion Jake La Motta, his rise to glory in the 1940s, his personal battles due to numerous inner demons, and his fall as an obese lounge lizard parody of his former self in the 1950s. Robert De Niro delivers a titanic portrayal that is one of the most astonishing performances ever recorded on film. He completely immersed himself in the ultimate method-acting tour-de-force as a young, lean, muscular Jake LaMotta. He rigorously trained with the real LaMotta mastering his crouched-in close style of boxing to become a completely convincing fighter, then he gain 60 pounds to play the bloated boxer in his later years. I was not surprised when De Niro won his well-deserved Oscar for Best Actor for this legendary performance. The brutal, visceral, no-holds-barred, highly stylized boxing sequences are some the best ever filmed. Showing the devastating blows hitting the bodies of the fighters and blood spraying out of their faces, it captures the intensity of the bouts with considerable force. The unforgettable climactic fight between LaMotta and Sugar Ray Robinson is one of the bloodiest and most gut-wrenching fight scenes ever made. Michael Chapman's stunning black & white cinematography is magnificent. The lighting of the film was made hash and stark to provide an expressionistic look and feel to the savage violence in the ring. Impeccable supporting performances by Joe Pesci, Cathy Moriarty, Nicholas Colasanto, and Frank Vincent. But it's De Niro's larger-than-life performance that owns this classic film. Scorsese's masterful direction is exhilarating, editor Thelma Schoonmaker won a Oscar for her dazzling work, and the period recreation is flawless. This film connects on primal themes with a brilliant Mardik Martin and Paul Schrader script which is rooted in contrary pulls of ambition, lust and redemption. ""Raging Bull"" has been crowned with so many critical laurels and awards that another word of praise seems hopelessly redundant, let's just say that it puts to shame virtually any American film made since then. Required viewing for anyone who truly loves the cinematic arts.

","(Flash Review)<br/><br/>The film follows the early career of rising boxing star Jake LaMotta as he battles middle weight contenders and personal decisions as he strives to get a title shot. While he is working up the ladder, his true persona is illuminated on how controlling, violent and distrustful he is off his wife, brother and pretty much everyone. From scene to scene, he is angry, inquisitive, schmoozing or scheming. This is one of those rise and fall stories that starts with arrogance and ends with humility. While the acting is rich with emotion, the lighting helps give a unique atmosphere to the scenes which are shot in rich black and white. Scorsese uses some creative cinematic moments to accentuate the emotional mood of specific scenes. It appears De Niro gained a bunch of weight from Jake's fighting weight to his post career weight. Don't pass up the Scorsese, De Niro and Pesci trifecta in their early days."
"someokiedude","8","1","1","13 November 2019"," The Anti-Rocky.
","Though I prefer Scorsese and Schrader's other collaborations such as The Last Temptation of Christ, and especially Taxi Driver. Raging Bull proves itself to be a contender among their other masterworks, it's certainly flawed, and not my favorite of Scorsese's line up. But the central performances alongside the masterful direction from Scorsese proves that this film isn't just another boxing film.<br/><br/>The film's development history is almost as interesting as the film itself, with many problems befalling the set such as Martin's drug use which almost caused his death, him stubbornly refusing to direct a sports film, as, to be fair, he wasn't, and still isn't, all that interested in sports, as well as other problems that I can't remember from the top of my head. But once Scorsese read the story of Jake LaMotta, he described it as having a profound effect on him and thus, he finally decided to take on the film. Scorsese's passion and vigor drives the film, as well as the passion of all of the other crew on board, especially Scorsese's frequent collaborator, star of the film, and close friend Robert De Niro.<br/><br/>The character of Jake LaMotta, played excellently by De Niro, is an endlessly complicated one, like many of Scorsese's other protagonists. Though I don't think he quite adds up to De Niro's best character Travis Bickle, the physical transformation of De Niro into LaMotta is one of the most impressive in all of cinema, ranking up there with Heath Ledger's Joker, Daniel Day Lewis' Daniel Plainview, and Jack Nicholson's Jimmy Hoffa, though very much like Nicholson's portrayal of Hoffa, De Niro has an uncanny resemblance to the boxer already to the point where it's almost indistinguishable to tell the two apart. Much like Goodfellas' Henry Hill, LaMotta is not easy to like, in fact he's pretty deplorable throughout the film and Scorsese, as usual, isn't afraid to make us hate him at points. But there's that confidence and gusto that he has that always keeps us coming back to him, even in our constant frustration at his paranoia and tendency to drive people away from him and the fact that he's never fully able to take responsibility for his actions.<br/><br/>There's also many other laudable aspects of this film, such as its black and white filtering which gives the film a gritty, neo-noir look that I adore, as well as saying that Joe Pesci might give his best performance that I've ever seen him do. I have an issue with Pesci where, let's face it, he plays the same character in every damn movie that he's in, though in this, I was pleasantly surprised to see a much more restrained, subdued performance from Pesci, who usually plays the street wise loud mouth. He's still a relatively tough guy and foul mouthed, but portrays Jake's brother, who's the calmer, more restrained one of the duo, and I was pleasantly surprised to see that Pesci could play someone else who wasn't the street wise loud mouth, though I do enjoy some of those performances from him, it proves to me that Pesci actually has range as an actor, even if he doesn't show it as often as he could.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the faltering of the movie is in the other, rather mediocre performances, especially of Cathy Moriarty as LaMotta's second wife Vicki, though I don't know if I can really fault the actors too much for that, as the performances from Pesci and De Niro are so magnificent, which I've also seen to be a problem in some of Scorsese's other films, mainly this one and The King of New York, but that's an entirely different conversation. There's also aspects of the pacing that truly bothered me, it felt rushed to me at times and I've always known Scorsese as a director who often takes his time when it comes to pacing, and one who often knows what he's doing when it comes to pacing, but, like with most good films, the good outweighs the bad.<br/><br/>Many have lauded Raging Bull as one of Scorsese's seminal works, while I don't know if I can give Raging Bull that. But Scorsese continues to amaze me with his versatility and I can say, with good conscience, that this one is a good Scorsese piece."

Raging bull is the story of a delusional champion drowned in his rage.
Acting in this movie is beyond my understanding. If you're a fan of boxing though, the boxing might be unique, yet could have been done in a better way.
The champion's relationships in this movie are heavily emphasized; especially, the one he has with his own thoughts.
Very smooth story telling, not bored a second throughout the whole movie. Congratulations for all the awards this movie has won; they speak for themseltves."

","The story of Jake La Motta, boxer and world middleweight champion.<br/><br/>Brilliant. Directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Robert De Niro, Raging Bull is far from your average boxing movie. Most boxing movies focus on the boxing, showing the main character as a hero and how they get to their inevitable success. Raging Bull on the other hand, while showing La Motta's successful career, doesn't paint him as perfect. Far from it: he is shown warts and all.<br/><br/>Scorsese shows quite well that what made La Motta great in the ring made him less great in his personal life. The intensity and brutality that made La Motta such a good fighter made him a less-than-perfect husband and person.<br/><br/>Who better then to portray an intense, complicated person than Robert De Niro. He gives a superb performance, for which he won his second (and final) Best Actor Oscar. Searingly gritty and intense."
"MattyRich92","9","1","1","18 May 2019"," A real KO of a movie
","In possibly the greatest true boxing film ever made we get the rise and eventual fall of Jack La Motta, played by Robert De Niro, during the 1940s and 1950s. Jack La Motta is a bad guy, and I'm glad the movie doesn't try to romanticize his life. He was an abusive man that manipulated people with fear and violence, which is what made him a great boxer. Honestly, people nowadays need to see this movie because it has an important underlying message about toxic masculinity and being too focused on fame. The fight scenes were excessive, and could have used some restraint. If Scorsese had made Raging Bull later in his career it would have been a better film, but we wouldn't have Goodfellas or Wolf of Wall Street. In Raging Bull, we see everything that would later make Martin Scorsese one of the GOAT."
"lisamcdonnell0816","8","1","1","27 January 2019"," Raw and gritty, not a feel-good film.
","The Raging Bull, released in 1980, is a film directed by Martin Scorsese and stars Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci as brothers Jake and Joey LaMotta. Jake LaMotta was a popular boxer turned controversial figure in the 1940's and 50's. DeNiro drove the vision of the film, as he was fascinated with LaMotta's life. Raging Bull takes the viewer on a journey through the rise to success and ultimate demise of a talented but troubled athlete. It was shot in black and white, to not only pay homage to 1940's boxing, but to reflect the darkness of the subject matter. The film is not for the faint of heart, as it is peppered with scenes of dramatic violence. Not only violence during the intimately-filmed boxing scenes, but domestic violence between LaMotta and both his first and second wives. The combination of Scorsese's direction, and DeNiro's acting is magical. The movie generates an emotional response throughout the entire 2 hours and 9 minutes of running time. From the beginning, when a young LaMotta is navigating through the boxing world, as well as his relationships with his brother and associates, until the end when he is breaking down alone in his jail cell, the viewer feels like they have been on this emotional roller coaster right along with him. All of the characters are from low-to-middle class neighborhoods in New York, are uneducated and lack a governor on their emotions. Scenes can sway from pleasant and touching to explosive in just a few short minutes. In one scene, Joey (LaMotta's brother, played by Pesci) is eating dinner with his family, and he threatens to stab his son with a knife if he doesn't stop playing with his food. The beginning of the story elicits a sense of hope. Jake LaMotta is winning fights, becoming a more seasoned fighter and starting a life with his second wife, Vickie. While the circumstances of their courtship were questionable, with Jake being married and Vickie being only 15 years old, the love between them seems to soften Jake and give him more purpose in life. Ultimately, Jake's demons overcome him. They creep in slowly, starting with fits of insecurity and jealously, and spiral into violence, substance abuse and other reckless behavior. DeNiro physically transformed himself, gaining 60 pounds to portray the fighter turned comedian and sleazy club owner. By the end of the movie, Vickie has become fed up and leaves LaMotta, who is ultimately arrested for nefarious activities in his nightclub. Any movie that can create a personal connection between the viewer and characters can be considered excellent, in my opinion, and the Raging Bull did exactly that."
"signalshd","Null","1","1","21 January 2019"," More About Family Than Boxing
","Raging Bull is a 1980 film starring Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. The film is directed by Martin Scorsese and based on the autobiography of the champion boxer Jake LaMotta. LaMotta's rise from contender to middleweight champion is chronicled in the film alongside his tumultuous relationship with his manager and brother, Joey (played by Pesci), and his second wife, Vickie (played by Cathy Moriarty). The latter third of the film depicts LaMotta's equally raucous post-boxing life and the disintegration of his family ties.<br/><br/>Scorsese's direction is superb. The camera angles and cuts during the boxing scenes provide a visceral feel for the audience of the gritty style of boxing employed by LaMotta. Scorsese contrasts LaMotta's ability to quickly turn a certain defeat in the ring into a victory while also showcasing LaMotta's ability to slowly erode his much-needed personal relationships. Shot in black-and-white, the film is reminiscent of a documentary. It sometimes feels as if we are peering into the actual living room where the LaMotta brothers are arguing about the next bout. De Niro, Pesci, and Moriarty give masterful performances of a family propelled by unbridled emotions.<br/><br/>Boxing, however, is simply a canvas for the screenwriters (Joseph Carter, Peter Savage, Paul Schrader, and Mardik Martin) to overlay a raw examination of ego, emotions, and family relationships. Jake LaMotta's ego is so large, and yet so fragile, that he accuses his brother and longtime manager, Joey, of having an affair with his wife. Vickie, Jake's wife, often acts on impulse and responds to Jake's outbursts and abuse by consorting with mobsters. No character here is beyond reproach, yet there are familial bonds that will be recognized by many viewers.<br/><br/>Raging Bull reflects working-class emotions. Even today, many people can relate to the type of raw personalities and family dynamics that are depicted through the LaMotta brothers in this film. In less capable hands, Raging Bull could easily have slipped into caricature. There are very few explanations given for the character's actions. But, Scorsese's keen direction and understanding of the culture, combined with the casts' brilliantly nuanced performances, provide a redeeming sensibility and a humanity to the story. Raging Bull is a dark, but recognizable, film."

","Directed by: Martin Scorcese<br/><br/>Starring: Robert De Niro, Cathy Moriarty, Jo Pesci, Nicholas Colasanto, Theresa Saldana. Budget: $18. Million Gross: $10 Million in box office, at the time Martin feared for a future in film making.<br/><br/>Summary: A Martin Scorsese boxing classic, that unlike other 'classic' chin hitting, floor bouncing boxing films, this one shows you the whole twelve rounds of fame, the price of one man's journey through the four corners of a ring to stardom. But always asking, is it worth it? and at what cost? <br/><br/>In the corner of a small dressing room sits a large figure of a man, with a thick nose (like its been broken countless times) stumpy body, smart suit, cigar in hand, drink on the dressing table. He begins to speak with a thick New York accent, you question in your mind, is this Robert De Niro as he looks like a broken large gangster from New York with a face that seemingly represents the staring actor of this film, but again so different. Who you are in fact looking at, is the character by the name of Jake La Motta (Played by De Niro), it is Jakes story we as audience follow throughout this film. At this point, Jake as described above is a washed out, ""bin had"" broken man, who has resorted to comedy in small town bars reminiscing of a past life, fighting (quite literally) for fame and glory within the world of glass jawed, iron fisted, feet skipping boxing legends.<br/><br/>Scorsese is well known for his use of violence and gritty story telling nature. Allow me to expand: within Raging bull Scorsese has masterfully incorporated the use of a black and white cinematic film style. As an aesthetic (which was a bold step for a director to take within modern film) this use of (for lack of a better word) 'lack' of colour allows the audience to divulge, empathise and 'feel' the struggle and story of Jakes life as a rising boxing champion. Furthermore, when filming the opening credits, Scorsese was convinced something was missing. We see Jake in the ring warming up whilst the theme tune plays, jabbing, stepping, dodging, ducking but there was no gritty nature of this pre match ritual. Therefore, Scorsese felt by removing all colour you will invite the audience to focus on this ritual, as a pose to the colour of the gloves, the ring, what time of day it is etc. Moreover, the 'lack' of colour really focuses attention to the impact of each punch, and was a way that Scorsese could really draw attention to the blood being drawn from the faces of each competitor, during the earth shattering jabs being made.<br/><br/>I have watched numerous boxing films, and as you would all probably agree the novelty has clearly started to wear off. But Raging Bull is by far superior to all your 'classics' like 'Rocky' etc. Robert De Niro provides arguably one of his best performances within a film, and that is a big statement. De Niro's performance takes you on a journey through despair, fame, heart break, isolation and loneliness. You will follow a man who struggles to distance himself from life within the ring, and outside of the ring. We see Jake push his family away, quite literally, constantly battling with paranoia as he believes his wife 'Vickie la Motta' is having an affair (a young Cathy Moriarty) with every man she comes into contact with. And the breaking point, is when he accuses his brother Joey (played by the fantastic Jo Pesci) of having an affair with Vickie (who also is a married man), and from this he cannot contain the balance and attacks Vickie. This moment is the turning point of the movie, we see Jake remember what is important in his life, and slowly you are led to believe maybe there is hope for Jake, maybe he can find away to 'hang up the gloves' and live a happy life.<br/><br/>Like the title suggests, this film demands masculinity, violence, misogyny and desperation. And all of this you are given, as from the moment go you are forced to understand a mans desire to achieve. But throughout you see the 'Bull' of Jakes nature, in both his boxing but also his personal life. Vickie (just like in a lot of Scorcese's classics) is perceived as the virgin or the whore, there can be no in between, and Jake will always find this out to late, the Love is what is important, not the lifestyle.<br/><br/>I found this film to have a very enthralling storyline, and is a fantastic insight to the life of a sportsman but also to the life beyond the fortune, fame and strain of the ring. Furthermore, you are given the perspective and feeling of what family life is like for an Italian American family within New York during the early years of world war 2, and what things like boxing, comedy and clubs were like. However, the jump between years as they pass within Jakes life are sometimes unclear and sporadic. Also, it is clearly a key part of the story the relationship between Jake and Sugar Ray as this drives Jake further into his 'bull' like nature, and I think this wasn't emphasised enough.<br/><br/>Not all films have happy endings, I guess this could be a metaphor for both life and this particular story. Greed, fame and fortune can take over even the best of us. Sure enough Jake cannot, is not able to notice what he has, had, needs, and therefore you are left with a man who had it all, but lost it. A man who really went the full twelve rounds.<br/><br/>Ratings:<br/><br/>IMDb: 8.3/10 Rotten Tomatoes: 98% MovieMAster: 7.8/10"

","Even though this movie came out over 30 years ago I only got around to seeing it currently, the recently released Blu-Ray copy from my public library. And as we would expect the picture and sound are perfect. De Niro won the Oscar for Best Actor and it is easy to understand why.<br/><br/>How this movie came about is just as interesting as the movie itself. De Niro is a boxing fan and after reading Lamotta's book figured it would make a good movie. Scorsese was NOT a boxing fan and resisted. But Scorsese was also having personal issues, with drugs, and Di Niro's visit to him in the hospital in 1978, urging him to get himself clean, and also to make the movie. Scorsese did and credits Di Niro with saving his life. <br/><br/>Also, in preparation for the role Di Niro trained as a boxer and actually won 2 of the 3 boxing matches he participated in. And for the later life of Lamotta gained a reported 60 pounds. <br/><br/>Since the movie is based on Lamotta's book, and Scorsese works hard to make accurate movies based on real people, the story we see, of a paranoid and jealous Lamotta, is probably very accurate. But upon seeing the movie and Lamotta asking his former wife if he was really like that, her response was ""You were worse.""<br/><br/>he got the name ""Raging Bull"" for his fighting style, just getting low and barging in and beating up opponents. But as we see the story of his life there always was a ""rage"" inside of him. Because of his paranoia and jealousy he had no good relationships, both his wife and his brother had to leave him to escape his wrath.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro of course is Jake La Motta and the story starts in 1941 when he was a young fighter just about 20. He meets his eventual second wife, Cathy Moriarty who plays Vickie La Motta, when she was just 15 and they married a year later. It was a bit disconcerting because Moriarty looked much older even though she in fact was still a teenager when filming.<br/><br/>And Joe Pesci, still a relative unknown, is remarkably good as the brother and business manager, Joey Lamotta, until Jake's rage drove him to estrangement.<br/><br/>The fight scenes are recreated very believably, and in the late 1950s after his boxing career came to an end Lamotta became an entertainer of sorts, usually a comedian in night spots and bars. His life was hard, and he spend some time in jail, but it was all of his own making."

","A surprise movie. Movie from the 80's but black and white. Movie made by Scorsese but not bloody. Without complicated and crossed inter-individual connections. With a culmination in the end but emotional one.<br/><br/>Raging bull is the naked nerve of trust and the feeling for closeness with the others. When this feeling is not present the result is clear - loneliness, roughness and madness. It is possible when somebody is extremely good in what he does that this guy to be a genius. Even if he is not, he can be at least a master. Living in extremes always build contrasting features of the different.<br/><br/>Each up has its down that is giving birth to another up before its down. When there is balance, when the break is hit before the depression and before the peak, when you are not making difference. The way up is slow, stubborn and hard. The way down is fast, teaching and painful.<br/><br/>The question of the meaning stands in front everything and everybody. It is clear, spread and bright but not explained.

"Red-Barracuda","9","1","1","21 August 2013"," Not your typical boxing movie
","This was a film that Robert De Niro wanted to make. Martin Scorsese initially thought the idea of making a boxing picture was an awful one. He hates all sports and had zero interest. But De Niro eventually won him over once Scorsese was able to see beyond the boxing and into the character beyond. Raging Bull is, like all the best sports films, only peripherally about the sport itself and is in reality a character study. And what an atypical man to base a drama around. The script came from Jake La Motta's memoirs. It is uncompromisingly about an unlikable violent man. La Motta was a middleweight boxing champion. Violent in and out of the ring and dangerously paranoid and insecure, he was brutal and animalistic. He actively enjoyed the fact he could take a beating and was very self-destructive – he ultimately went from world champion to sleazy nightclub owner. His story isn't uplifting like most sports dramas. It's harsh and unflinching. There are no typical underdog boxing movie moments or montages in this one.<br/><br/>Much has been said about Robert De Niro's turn in the central role. But with very good reason as this truly is an acting tour de force. He famously gained over 50 pounds to play the washed up older La Motta. This determination to take himself from prize-fighter shape to obesity is simply incredible but the natural brilliance of his performance overall is peerless. He is ably supported with a great cast, most notably Joe Pesci as his brother Joey and Cathy Moriarty as his wife Vickie. While Scorsese's bold visual style and typical gritty dramatic forcefulness combine to fantastic effect. The period detail and sumptuous black and white photography seal the deal and ensure that there is a timeless visual quality to Raging Bull too. Surprisingly it didn't do so well at the box office despite critical appreciation and Oscar nominations. It was probably too difficult and out of time for the 80's. But subsequently, it has been regarded by many as one of the best from that decade."

","I haven't seen too many of Scorsese's movies before this. In fact, the only two I've seen are Goodfellas and Taxi Driver, both of which I respect and thoroughly enjoyed but to me, none of his films so far beat Raging Bull, which to me, just caught my attention from the very first scene to the last.<br/><br/>This film stars two of the greatest actors, in my humble opinion. Joe Pesci and Robert de Niro, who are absolutely fantastic in this movie. The film focuses on boxer Jake La Motta, whose life turns upside down during his days as a boxer. I've never really being a fan of Sport movies. I've hated most but this film is simply one of the best films I've ever seen and one of the few films I saw that I did not stop once to take a break. It was just that good The chemistry between Pesci and de Niro is absolutely unparallaled and unmatched. They worked brilliantly in Scorsese's Goodfellas and they do so here too.<br/><br/>The story in this film is just so moving and just thoroughly entertaining. The film is filled with anger, jealousy, violence, comedy and pretty much everything else that makes a movie a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Some people will argue when it comes to this movie, ""Well, where are the emotional moments?"" To be fair, the whole movie really is an emotional roller-coaster. We have Jake La Motta, a man whose life falls as he succeeds in boxing. Isn't that tragic enough? Seeing a man's life being destroyed from the inside and the outside. Simply put yourself in Joey's shoes and think how it would feel if you were in his place when Jake ordered his brother to leave. Those are emotional breakdown moments.<br/><br/>Raging Bull is a cinematic masterpiece and in my opinion, the best movie of the 1980's. Its simply brilliant in terms of everything.

The direction and tone is breathtaking. The editing was great. His quick screen cuts with Thelma Schoonmaker is as brilliant as always. Poetic to the eyes. Cinematography was superb.His camera movements inside and outside of the ring is legendary. The black and white filming only adds to the beauty of the film. Brought class and design to the screen. I've read people complain about the fight scenes not being believable but I believe that was the inflection Scorsese was looking for. It was a mess in the ring. It was careless, unorganized, sloppy and devastating. Jake La Motta was a monster and the choreographed fight scenes spoke for him.<br/><br/>The acting in this film was marvelous. What more could be said about Robert De Niro? He was magnificent. An Oscar winning performance. He's brilliant though the character he is portraying was far from it. Jake La Motta is a self-destructing man who is spiraling out of control. He is rude, impatient, paranoid and oh, so violent! Yet at the end of the film, you feel sorrow for such a monster. Joe Pesci is also great. He stands by his brother's side as long as he could. He is abused physically and emotionally in his home and in public. After a while, the audience begins to feel his pain. He is looked at like a clown by his own blood. But at the end, he has the final laugh. Great story telling.<br/><br/>The score was fascinating. Scorsese went for a more classical genre in this picture. There's such carnage and menace through the film yet in the background you hear such beautiful music. It left me at a loss for words yet at the end, it worked. It worked like a charm. It brought class to such a brilliant and brutal story.<br/><br/>Raging Bull is a masterpiece.

For these strokes of style (best evident in the riveting ring scenes) this film is a poetic presentation of a very reprehensible person that is a fighting force of nature.<br/><br/>Problem is, he can not separate that power from the professional to the personal and is a one dimensional destructive dynamo that causes a hurt whenever he is present.

You never feel sorry for him but you do feel sorry for the human condition.<br/><br/>That is the point.

"wandereramor","8","1","1","23 September 2012"," An athlete with domestic problems? Crazy
","Raging Bull is a very violent movie, but in a distinctly different way from the modern gorefests we usually associate with the term. There's an undercurrent of anger that runs through the whole thing, and which always threatens to burst out into open violence. As the back of the box tells you, it's this anger that leads to Jake LaMotta's professional success and private ruin. But that seems to give it too much of a purposeful direction -- the violence seems to move in all directions with no rhyme or reason. LaMotta wins and loses fights on the caprices of fate. He beats up his wife for no good reason, and goes about his business as if nothing happened.<br/><br/>It's this directionlessness that I found kind of alienating. That may be an intentional choice, but after a while the procession of fights and events becomes a little numbing. Maybe this is why, though I respect Raging Bull, I'm not sure it belongs in the rarefied air of the Best of All Time lists that it usually occupies. Or maybe it's the occasional affectation too many, like the slow-motion opening boxing sequence.<br/><br/>But on the whole Raging Bull is a remarkably well-crafted film. Scorcese puts together boxing matches beautifully, and does as good a job with physical interaction. DeNiro is, of course, the main attraction, and he's both riveting to watch and able to quietly capture all of the changes that LaMotta goes through over the course of the film. The supporting cast is pretty damn good too. It may not be the best of all time, but it's still very solid."

","What I am about to say might be different with movie criticism. I have watched the three movies of Scorsese in order of watching: ""Goodfellas"", ""Casino"", and ""Raging Bull"" and now I have feeling that I have watched one unique movie three times. The order of watching this triplet was vice versa with respect to the date of their production. I'm not going to give jargons or use cinema terminology but as simple as it is I have to mention that if I were to name these movies I would name them sth1, sth2, and sth3. It has a similarity with Sergio Leone's triplet: ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"", ""For a Few Dollars More"", and ""A Fistful of Dollars"" which I think it's not fair to call them all alike. Basically it is a couple consisting ""For a Few Dollars More"", and ""A Fistful of Dollars"". Anyway, Scorsese's triplet has its own philosophy and tries to deliver some good documentary view of American society, but still I cannot accept that these three movies are different. One of them could be enough for once in a lifetime watching. Scorsese is a professional and belittling big people doesn't reduce their real values and I'm not going to do that. I'm talking as an audience who has seen this triplet and happen to know the name of the director. That's all. That's right that Deniro won Oscar for his memorable performance in ""Raging Bull"" but still they are the same and we should call one of them original & the other two copies.

","I have to admit first of all that I'm not a great fan of boxing, but I know who Jake La Motta was and I'm aware of what he achieved. This biopic tells of his rise to fame, but it also tells of his life out of the ring, about his brother, his wife and how he eventually fell from grace, only to get up again. But more of that later, here's a brief summary first (summary haters and those that don't wish to know anything about the plot please take fifteen rounds with Sugar Ray while I write the next paragraph).<br/><br/>As we begin, Jake La Motta is already a well known boxer, he is married to his first wife with whom he constantly argues. He is managed by his brother Joey who does his best to get him fights in the hope he'll get a shot at the title. It seems a long time coming but Jake has other things on his mind at the moment. He as seen a girl, Vickie, who has taken his eye. She is blonde and very popular with everyone, including the rich Salvy, another local guy from the Bronx. But Jake is determined and eventually makes her his. They eventually marry, but Jake is always wary of other men, including his brother, around his wife. This streak of jealousy will eventually cost him dearly. Inside the ring, he has no such problems, beating all comers, and beating them so well that nobody wants to fight him. Eventually his chance comes, but there's a catch... And there, I'll have to leave it as the spoiler police would lock me up if I said any more.<br/><br/>Shot almost entirely in black and white, this film has the look and feel of one made back in the 1940's to 1950's. This works very well to give the atmosphere of the period in which it is set. A nice, mostly unobtrusive, score also works very well to set the tone of the movie. I thought Robert De Niro was tremendous as Jake La Motta, he gave his all for this part, even putting on a lot of weight for the latter scenes where La Motta becomes a stand-up comedian. Joe Pesci was also excellent as his brother Joey and Cathy Moriarty was good too as the sultry Vickie.<br/><br/>This film is seen by many as a modern classic, and I can see why, it is very good I can't deny Scosese's skill. I think the main problem I found with it was that I didn't find it particularly entertaining. It's very melodramatic in places, but it didn't grip me in the way I expected or maybe I'm being too harsh. De Niro is truly excellent too, but a great performance doesn't always make for a great film I'm afraid. If you haven't seen it before then I can definitely recommend it to you for at least one viewing, if just for De Niro. I'll maybe watch it again in a few years and rave about it, but for now, it's very very good but not great.<br/><br/>My score: 8.4/10"

","Now, arguably one of the most popular commercial boxing movies is Rocky. Surprisingly, the movie has an even bigger fan following overseas despite it's strong ties to America culture and the story of the underdog overcoming all adversity.<br/><br/>Now, in spite of this, Raging Bull had a far different scope on character study. First, it has a basis in historical fact and biography. But, the main attraction to this movie is the study of Jake's struggle as a human being. For as much of an animal he was in the ring, it was purely fueled by the inner context of an animalistic struggle within himself; something that he was never able to evade and something that had dramatic effects on everyone around him.<br/><br/>There was a dynamic study of relationship between Jake and his brother and the triangular relationship inclusive of his wife. The character is captured magnificently by Martin Scorsese and it is surely a fueling character study in part by De Niro."

","As far as shooting in B&W, it seems the only way that this movie could have been made ...my question is would it have been better with a red filter, creating contrast. Check out Paper Moon footage against this very shadowy movie, or even some Orsen Wells films. The red filter used on these movies creates a sharpness and a contrast that is missing. However, the movie does represent the film making techniques of the time with a ""Casablacaish"" mystique. The characters fade into each other, and the outstanding acting becomes the central focus. Scorcesse's camera angles are the best since Kubrick, when LaMotta goes down with the three-hundred sixty degree camera shot, it precludes Spike Lee's signature move."

","I admit I was never all that interesting in seeing this picture as I was not a fan of the Bronx Bull but I knew it was a masterpiece so I gave it a whirl one night. This film is different from most 80's movies in that it is black and white which is certainly remarkable and quite possibly most ingenious. DeNiro is great, Pesci is great and the movie therefore is great. DeNiro got an Oscar and Pesci should have got an Oscar. I would say the most fascinating thing about Jake LaMotta besides the fact he was one of the greatest boxers of all time is that he was friends with and personally knew several members of Nino Gaggi's uncontrollable DeMeo Street Crew of the Gambino Crime Family featured in the best selling book Murder Machine by Jerry Capeci and Gene Mustain. A great book maybe the best one on Organized Crime ever written. This movie does need to be seen it is powerful."

","Great direction by the best director alive. Outstanding black and white cinematography, acting,and editing. The best boxing scenes ever filmed. I love the way Scorsese emphasizes that violence and sex are equivalent for Jake. Scorsese shows this in the scene where Jake pours ice water on penis to suppress sex drive just before a fight. After the fight, Scorsese shows a prolonged closeup of Jake's fist in a bucket of ice water. Therefore equating Jakes fist and his penis. Scorsese also cuts from scenes of Jake and his wife (usually romantic in nature) to scenes of him boxing,continually emphasizing that sex and violence are equivalent forms of release to Jake.

","The drama, the fights, the acting! BRILLIANT!! I am waiting for Eastwood's Million Dolar Baby before I declare this as the Best movie about a boxer/boxing ever! The movie chronicles the life of Jake LaMott, a real life boxer. We watch as his career ascends... and descends. No- scratch that his life ascends and descends. The moody black and white that Scorsese used to film this really adds to the feel of things- it is almost a contrast to the events. Not every choice is labeled in black and white, there are fine subtleties that distort your perception... The boxing is raw- hard hitting beautiful. However, the boxing accounts for maybe one third of the events in this film. Just wait until DeNiro gives his epilogue in the end. He recites lines from On the Waterfront. The scene is beautiful...

","Jake La Motta represented the ideal Beast Man of the 20th century. Raging Bull is his story. The story of a man who gains the world but loses his soul. Like (the great) Zampano in La Strada, Scorsese uses La Motta to show the similarity of two men. Raging Bull is in a way a love story between La Motta and the second wife he takes (Very similar to Zampano's purchasing of his second girl). In the end, La Motta loses his youth and his act and once again is left with memories after breaking down from the loss of his true love. Like the repeated song that La Motta says over and over and over again, Zampano has his trick of breaking the medal chain around his chest and having his long winded speech about it. Both stories are equal and amazing. It is America's La Strada!"

","I was appalled at the low ranking this film got on AFI's and this (IMDb) site's greatest films list.  I watched this movie only a month ago, so my opinion is going to be a bit biased because I can still feel the entire movie.  I have never seen a film like Raging Bull before and chances are that I never will again.  It has been said that this is the greatest movie of the 80s.  I have to agree.  In fact, this movie is one of the best ever, maybe up there at 3 or 4.  This was probably DeNiro's and Pesci's finest hour (not to degrade their later collaborations, in any way).  Scorsese did a brilliant job with bringing this to life.  If it had been in anyone else's hands, it probably would have ended up being mediocre or ""good"" at best. The straight-forward (ie: no attempt at shallow humor, no attempt at political rhetoric, no pseudo-philosophy) dialogue and the use of black and white gave it a very realistic feel.  The pauses in dialogue and the not quite long, but certainly noticable, moments of silence actually seemed normal, or at least suitable, for the setting.  Then again, I am neither a cinematographer or screenwriter.  Basically, I watched this film and I was hooked.  The only way to have any idea about the magnitude of this film's greatness is to watch it."

","Raging Bull was the first of the Scorsese/De Niro partnership that I watched and it was well worth my time. A powerful, emotional, beautifully crafted biographical tale of a boxer with an overly-aggressive temperament and an anger management problem, it took me to a high cliff peak and essentially just dropped me by the end.<br/><br/>Up to the two hour mark and Jake La Motta's final fight, this film is one of the greatest and most powerful I've ever seen, but for me the ending didn't quite stick because it came as quite an anticlimax to what was basically such a climactic story. The character of Jake La Motta is artfully constructed and De Niro's performance defies definition and yet the film as a whole left me feeling unfulfilled because the emotion that was so paramount up to that point became quite slow and stagnant; as a biography it works well, but not brilliantly.<br/><br/>That's not to detract anything at all from this exceptional classic, that was merely how I felt after watching the film. Scorsese really shows his true class and quality in this film, he is such a master craftsman and manages to extract one of the most memorable anti-hero performances of all time from De Niro while Joe Pesci also does a fine job as Joey.<br/><br/>I really wanted to enjoy this film and I really wanted it to be better but the way I see it, it could either have been made longer to extract all of the story from the final half hour, or have cut out the last half hour altogether because overall, it just seemed almost completely irrelevant in the way it was made. ****1/2 / *****"

De Niro plays Jake La Motta, a boxer whose life causes violence inside and outside of the ring. We are taken on quite a journey through Jake's life, meeting dramatic and shocking moments at each turn. The effects are startling and spectacular, as Jake pounds the crap out of each of his opponents to rise to the top. Joe Pesci plays Joey, the champ's brother and coach. He does a surprising job in his role, showing that although he worked on a few memorable gangster films following this movie (those films also co staring De Niro and Frank Vincent, ironicly) he is capable of doing other work. Back to effects. The boxing fights in this movie make Rocky look like pre school, man they are intense! It's no wonder that La Motta was nick named the Raging Bull. Once you see De Niro getting hit, you can feel it in your bones that he is going to make the other guy pay. Except for the final fight, where Jake makes a powerful point. To top off this exceptional movie we are given a rich musical score. The main music theme played in Raging Bull is a perfect match for what happens with the story. Overall if anyone enjoys powerful drama, almost even more powerful action, and a few gags here and there, rent Raging Bull. This is a title not to be missed by any fan of the genres listed. 9.4/10"

","First of all this is a character drama, Robert DeNiro gives his best performance ever. Pesci and Moriarity fit perfectly into their roles as Jake's younger brother and Jake's wife. Without a doubt this is Scorsese's best directorial piece, everything fits perfectly. DeNiro's monologues are a piece of work, the domestic abuse scenes are extremely well done and give you a genuine scare because the way Scorsese does it is original. The fight scenes are better than Rocky and and other boxing movie, quiet scenes about the family quickly and violently erupt into the ring showing powerhouse punches and knockouts with cameras going off and blood and sweat being sprayed in every direction. <br/><br/>9/10, DeNiro arguably gives the best performance of the 80's. Joe Pesci goes with DeNiro was bread goes with butter, look for them together in Goodfellas and Casino, all three movies are Scorsese/DeNiro/Pesci masterpieces and they do not fail to amaze and entertain."

","What ""Raging Bull"" is for me stands up right there in the title. I don't dig on boxing and don't really get the whole appeal. Still, however, ""Raging Bull"" nearly uses the boxing as a subtext for the true story within the film, as I had hoped. It's about the psychological and emotional and physical fights that occur outside of the ring for Jake for his entire career. Robert DeNiro kicks some major butt in one of his best roles. For those folks who have trouble with black and white movies (of any decade, considering ""Schindler's List""; ""Elephant Man""; ""Clerks""; ""Stranger Than Paradise"", among others)... for them I shall suggest ""Raging Bull"" to change their mind."

","Beautifully polished, intense and gripping, the biopic tale of Jake La Motta stands firmly as the finest sporting movie ever made. But what separates 'Raging Bull' from others in the genre is the way in which the character is forced to confront his inner demons, as the consequences of an initially heroic, but ultimately self-destructive lifestyle, threaten to take their toll.<br/><br/>The partnership struck between Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese is, to this day, the most successful actor-director combination to have prevailed. Similarly, the chemistry between De Niro and Joe Pesci has spread over a number of other top films, whether it be 'Casino' or Goodfellas.' In 'Raging Bull,' however, the trio are found at the top of their game.<br/><br/>The decision to shoot the film in black and white adds to the authenticity, making stunning use of imagery in the process - the sight of De Niro bouncing around in a dark, smoke-infested ring, is simply breathtaking, for instance. The structure of the film is also highly impressive, with events ending where they started. <br/><br/>The legendary Mohammed Ali may be boxing's biggest name, but his recent biopic, 'Ali,' falls way short of the high standards set by 'Raging Bull.'"

Raging Bull, an autobiography about the life of Jake La Motta, is a film that wowed me in some parts, but at the end left me wanting more.  The high points in the movie are numerous.  The outstanding direction by Martin Scorsese, as well as the use of black and white film creates a 1 2 combination that brings out the sheer drama, and intensity that is most of the movie.  The absolutely brilliant acting by Robert De Niro is just plain incredible, and a well deserved Oscar winning effort.  And not to be overlooked is the part of Joey, played by Joe Pesci.  Also the choreographed fight scenes are superbly well done.  However the ending, if you ask me, left a lot to be desired, and may have been the result of last minute script changes.  I remember watching the tv in disbelief as the credits began rolling by, this couldnt be the end?  Alas it was, and unfortunately an otherwise powerful movie ends with a very weak denounment.

After two decades, the film's greatness endures.<br/><br/>Filmed in brooding black and white, but with devilishly clever color clips, Raging Bull is the perfect film noir.  DeNiro, whose effect on the film reaches everything from writing to lighting, is the greatest film actor of all time, and this is his greatest hour.  He brings an odd humanity to the most inhumane of all sports.  He is vulnerable, yet stoic, confident, yet deeply self-doubting.  He epitomizes the frailty of even the strongest among us.  A most deserved Oscar can only begin to pay tribute to DeNiro, who collaborated in a rewrite to make the unctuous LaMotta more sympathetic, and then portrayed him with such sympathy and insight that we are constantly reminded that even the most unlikeable of people are still people.<br/><br/>Spanning 23 years, at once managing to be epic and intimate, Martin Scorsese's masterpiece is perfect in every way.  Cinematogaphy rivaled only by the likes of Orson Welles or Francis Ford Coppola, who later directed DeNiro in the Godfather trilogy, a score both tragic and majestic, and oh the acting. Even Joe Pesci contributes an Oscar-worthy career performance as the brother of Jake LaMotta (DeNiro).<br/><br/>The fact that such films as Shawshank Redemption, Memento, Saving Private Ryan, L.A. Confidential, The Matrix, and Das Boot, all superb films in their own right, and It's a Wonderful Life and Toy Story 2, lightweight fodder at best, are ranked in this site higher than Raging Bull is ludicrous.  Even the finest among them pale by comparison, and when they are two decades old, will be far less remembered, revered, and imitated, than this powerful, and perhaps most important, giant of the modern era.<br/><br/>If I could only have ten DVD's for the rest of my life, this would have to be one of them."

The superb filming is highlighted in the marvelous boxing scenes.  The screen can get blurry at times(intentional) and the camera moves quickly around the ring and whips around each fighter as they jab and punch.  The glorious black and white and eventual color also work out very well.  In the early and middle parts of the film, the movie is in black and white.  The setting and characters all look like they came directly from the forties, where these portions are based.  Even if you're not a boxing fan, you'll still be amazed.  If average fights were filmed the way the fights in the movie were, God knows I'd be watching more often.  And another thing: the pacing was brilliant.

","Raging Bull is one of Scorsese's best yet. Though out in 1980, I only just saw it after its recent re-release in London (and elsewhere)- and I can confidently say that it's classic film-making at its height. De Niro plays boxer Jake La Motta, a tormented human being whose own demons always seem to frustrate his life's ambitions of being the champion. The film is unforgiving in its portrayal of intense action and one is not ever allowed to feel sorry for La Motta. Yet it has soft moments too- for example the erotic sensuality of Cathy Moriarty's legs splashing the water in the swimming pool. Scorsese completely exploits the potential of black and white film. Two interesting things to note: first, La Motta himself was a consultant for the film; and second, there is a very interesting line from the bible at the end of the film which tells us a lot about what message Scorsese wants us to come away with. I was fascinated. But don't see it on a date!"
"dave fitz","Null","1","1","7 August 2000"," brutal, intense Scorsese classic
","This is a true film classic. It tells the true story of Jake LaMotta, a talented but emotionally unstable and self-destructive boxer. Robert DeNiro (Oscar for Best Actor) gives one of the great acting performances ever, ranking with Henry Fonda in Grapes of Wrath, Denzel Washington as Malcolm X and Gary Cooper in High Noon. <br/><br/>Directed by Martin Scorsese, it helped to launch the careers of Joe Pesci, Cathy Moriarty and Theresa Saldana. It is one of the most intense and electric movies I've ever seen. The fact it was filmed in black and white adds to the film's gritty atmosphere. Raging Bull has been hailed by critics and moviegoers as the best film of the 1980's. Scorsese certainly deserved an Oscar for this one, although he lost out to Robert Redford (Ordinary People). He's the best director out there. Combined with DeNiro, one of the best actors in the world and both at the top of their games, you have a true masterpiece. 10/10"

But I'm reading and have nearly finished the book Raging Bull and it makes the movie recede in my mind. Don't get me wrong, Scorcese put it together quite nicely, and of course Deniro is intense. The book is better because of the way Lamotta described the fight scenes; the sweat, the noise, the feeling of winning the middle weight championship, and the feeling of going crazy was out standing. I think Scorsese is a visionnary because he shows the cruel world of boxing and what it does to a man and his pride. Plus the chemistry between Pesci and Deniro was electrifying. It is Deniro's best movie and he deserved his Oscar."

Citizen Kane's use of proportions witht the actors, making John Kane seem large, was good and all, but Raging Bull's cinematography was so beautiful. I could stop a scene in my mind, make a still of the scene, and it would be a well shot photo.

It is a terrible journey of self-sabotage.<br/><br/>DeNiro gives the amazing tour-de-force performance that won him an Oscar. It is not a pleasant movie, but it does reveal the tragic flaws in human nature and even offers a slight bit of redemption."

","Raging Bull was a complete let down.  The story alone is as old as time. An abusive, over-reacting, over-protective, and over-bearing boxer loses two wives, his children, and his brother.  Not by any sort of tragedy, but his own temper and actions.  DeNiro, of course, was outstanding, and its always nice to see little Joe Pesci beat the precious body fluid out of some poor sap, but LaMotta was no one special to write about (I guess that's why he took it upon himself).  I can't believe one of the most notorized directors of time actually became more notorized because of ""Raging Bull."""
"faulkbabo","2","13","42","28 June 2003"," What'd I do? What'd I do?
","Raging Bull masquerades as a boxing movie, trying to capitalize on Rocky popularity in 1980. It failed. The fundamental difference between both movies is that we care what happens to Rocky and want him succeed as the underdog, whereas we couldn't care less about what happens to an ungrateful bum called Jake LaMotta. The movie does nothing to bring you closer to LaMotta's character, it actually does the opposite and makes you loathe him. Why should we care what happens to him? Isn't that the point of a movie, to bring you closer to the characters and story?<br/><br/>That brings me to the boxing scenes. They are horrible. The blood is the worst I've seen in any movie - it just sprays everywhere like a geyser. Very realistic. We are not told the significance of any of Lamotta's fights, except the one where he's fighting a guy that his wife said was good looking. The boxing is pretty meaningless in the movie, so they should have just left it out. As it is, it was painful to watch.<br/><br/>The movie is shown in black and white. Did Scorcese think that we wouldn't be able to tell that it's set in the 40's if it was in color? The effect is that the movie just looks cheap. Couldn't afford color cameras or what?<br/><br/>It's also too long. Over 2 hours is a challenge for most to stay awake that long. I kept watching in hopes that the movie would stop sucking, but it never did. It sucked from start to finish.<br/><br/>DeNiro is a fine actor and plays his role well, as did Pesci, but even they couldn't do anything to save this sad excuse for a movie. There just isn't anything that draws you into the movie or makes you care about the characters in the slightest. What you end up with is a hollow movie in black and white about some bum that wasted his boxing talent. Big deal.<br/><br/>There's no actual ending to the movie either. It just kind of degenerates to the point where Lamotta lands himself in jail, and that's pretty much where it ends. I was half asleep by that point, so maybe there was a point to the movie and I missed it. But I doubt that.<br/><br/>After wasting over 2 hours watching this movie, I couldn't help but echo Lamotta's sentiments after he threw a fight:<br/><br/>""What'd I do? What'd I do?""<br/><br/>2 out of 10. 1 for DeNiro and 1 for Pesci. Both tried their best to save this movie, but couldn't."
"senor_spielbergo123","Null","5","13","1 May 2017"," Over-rated, not Scorsese's best.
","You have to honor Robert's dedication to the role. But despite quality acting he's nonetheless portraying a totally unlikable, one dimensional character: he's a brutal, paranoid wife-beater. In the jail cell towards the end he seems to have a brief moment of acknowledging his shortcomings. But his character arc is non-existing, as nothing much changes for him. In that regard he is a very Shakespearean character that ends up lonely. But the emotional impact is only mild since it was nearly impossible to sympathize with Jake for the whole movie. At some point you might strongly root for Jake's wife, but even she is a passive and rather unimpressive character.<br/><br/>The film does not have many memorable scenes – only the last boxing fight and the TV scene qualify. The last boxing fight has a very effective visual style. All black and white, blood, gore. It signals that it's all downhill from here on for Jake. Apart from that, the camera work is rather unimpressive. <br/><br/>In summary, the movie seems rather over-rated. It depicts the character of the ""Raging Bull"" and his famous temper very convincingly. But it takes two hours to tell the story of the consequential downfall of this man and once it's over, you want at least half an hour back. The story did not bore me at any point, but it did not force me to the edge of my seat either. It does not stand for repeated re-watching, unless you're interested in doing a character study."

","Raging Bull is a ""boxing"" movie about A boxer named Jake La Motta and follows his life from 1941 to 1964. Why do I call it a ""boxing"" movie, because there is very little boxing in the movie. Sure there a lot of Motta's fights shown, but half of them are less than two minutes and mostly show time spent at the end, beginning, and in the corner. The other half is a few stills of the match combined with the who, when, and where. The grand total is less than 15 minutes. They don't even talk about boxing much or show Motta train. Most of the movie is about Motta's private life. That is not very interesting either. I got no emotion from the story at all. Scorsese also tried to convey that Motta and Sugar Ray Robinson were rivals. Other than them fighting a lot, that never comes across. Other problems include the blood effects and continuity of the blood. The blood squirts out in a very unrealistic fashion. When blood does get on someone, it is gone in the next shot.<br/><br/>Don't watch Raging Bull ever, even if it comes on TV and there is nothing else to do."

","As it seems, we live in a society, in which it is important enough to portrait the spiritually rather unimportant live of somebody, whose calling it was to knock down other people in a strange kind of activity, that has less to with sports, but much more with aggression. Since movies always portrait the time and the society in which we live and since the movie, that stands here under discussion, belongs to the 250 best rated movies ever, one must assume, that our society is as primitive as the topic of this movie.<br/><br/>Doubtless, the acting capacity of Robert De Niro and, most of all, Joe Pesci, is admirable. But, if I am allowed here to try a kind of meta-comment: Somebody wrote, that this film ""will remain in my heart forever: the splendid black & white, the contrast between the slow moving scenes and the frenetic ones, the choice of the music and the sense of loss which entangles the whole movie"". At this point, I can only shake my head, because there are thousands of black and white movies, slow and ""frenetic"" scenes, the choice of music reached its culmination point in Faßbinder's movies, but not in Scorsese's, and the sense of loss is a very prominent motive since the silent movie time. So, all this compliments have absolutely nothing to do with this special movie.<br/><br/>Complete loss of common sense is reached at the moment, when this somebody writes: ""Martin Scorsese is the most poetic director of the last 30 years"": What has boxing to do with poetry? Is there nowadays an ""aesthetics of boxing"", perhaps an ""aesthetics of brutality""? And, after all, each movie must have a message, because otherwise, it is neither worth to film a story nor to watch such a movie. The ""Raging Bull"" is a paradigmatic example of a movie without any recognizable message, hence a ""raging nonsense""."

This due to the rather flat and repetitive storyline.

Yet the fact that it is so perfectly shot and acted out makes that the point of this movie comes greatly across. It is of course a side of men, we rather not see and I found myself frequently trying to strangle LaMotta in my mind.<br/><br/>On a more negative side, I found the movie to be plodding at times and since the drama around LaMotta was quite one-dimensional, I would have rather seen this movie go more into the boxing and the training aspect (like Rocky did).

"OttoVonB","6","3","7","13 October 2015"," Craft VS Content
","Raging Bull is a portrait of boxer Jake LaMotta, and is often hailed as the greatest film of the 80s. Tellingly, it is most commonly revered by people who have a certain knowledge of or interest in the craft of filmmaking. What could possibly be wrong with that? <br/><br/>Martin Scorsese is the most enduring New Hollywood director after Steven Spielberg, and, unlike the latter, managed to more often than not succeed commercially without giving in to audience tastes and expectations, hence the higher level of respect he receives from critical circles. His earlier work in particular was a perfect combination of raw, powerful storytelling with an encyclopedic knowledge of filmmaking technique, and in Robert De Niro and Paul Schrader he found worthy, reliable collaborators with the talent to create these rage-infused films. It is strange to consider that this particular project was not one he originally wanted to make.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro nursed a fascination with La Motta and threw years of energy into convincing both Schrader and Scorsese to make a film about him, often to the confusion of those around him. During one story meeting, a studio exec asked the dream team why they wanted to make a film lionizing this ""cockroach"". That is perhaps the heart of the divisive issue.<br/><br/>Raging Bull is a masterpiece of direction, one of the most alluringly shot films you will ever see, and contains some of the best performances ever committed to celluloid. But, expert character study that it is, it is that of a truly repugnant individual, whom it does indeed lionize beyond reason, and upon whom it forces an awkward and undeserved absolution (""I once was blind but now I see""?), the result of a, at the time, personally burnt-out Scorsese forcing his own Christian sense of renewal onto an incompatible character.<br/><br/>Raging Bull is, and should be, mandatory viewing for anyone interested in filmmaking or performance. However, it is more ""important"" than enjoyable, almost more significant for its technical virtues and the bygone creative era it represents, easy to admire but very hard to love. Its points of contention are the same that feed such heated debate around other classics, most notoriously 2001 A Space Odyssey, worlds apart yet similar in that it succeeds as a work of art while failing as a story and piece of entertainment. Love it or hate it for what it has to say, there is beauty and artistry in how it says it.<br/><br/>To film historians and a majority of critics, Raging Bull ended 80s cinema by opening it, saying all there was to say. But to me, its fellow black-and-white best picture nominee that year (also containing the resounding cry ""I am not an animal"") is a more affecting, more enduring statement about human nature than Raging Bull turned out to be."

Throw in some brutal fight scenes and a melancholy score and you've got a dark portrait of one mean s.o.b.<br/><br/>Again, it's not really a boxing movie, and that's not a criticism. I think the best scenes happen outside of the ring, where Joe Pesci stands as De Niro's equal and the two really electrify the movie. And as wickedly as those title bouts are filmed, the most harrowing scene is just LaMotta in a jail cell. Scorsese just holds that shot interminably, never offering relief with a cut.

","If I had to describe this movie in one word, that word would be 'striking'.<br/><br/>The world is crazy, and for the time being, it's only going to get crazier. When it gets to be too much, I sit in my bed, turn off all external stimuli, and remind myself that I have somehow, some way gotten to live at a place and time where I can watch movies like Raging Bull.<br/><br/>I kick myself for not having seen this sooner. It can be argued that Scorsese has made more great films than any other filmmaker, but this is his greatest. It is one of the greatest films I have ever seen. De Niro delivers his best-ever acting job, and the other actors play their parts, but this is Scorsese's vision through and through.<br/><br/>It is based off the story of Jake LaMotta, a former middleweight champion boxer famous for his toughness and turbulent life outside the ring, but it does not fall victim to any of the typical fallings of 'true story' movies. There is no crass sentimentalism or pseudo-wisdom. It is filthy, violent, experimental, and operatic.<br/><br/>Many of Scorsese's movies are based off real events or people, but none feel as original and dynamic as this film. Had I never heard of LaMotta, I'd be likely to say he was a fictional character made up by Scorsese. Without changing anything about the man's life, Scorsese has made it his own.<br/><br/>If a pirate kidnapped you, stuck you on a deserted island that somehow had electricity and a DVD player, and held out every Scorsese movie ever made, asking you to pick one... choose Raging Bull. This is prime Scorsese. No one else would even think of attempting a film like that. Scorsese mends the very boundaries of art to his will.<br/><br/>Who other than Scorsese would stop the film midway through to speed ahead five years not by a means of a simple time skip but an elaborate montage contrasting highly stylized boxing action with lighthearted shots of the LaMotta family that are the only colored parts of this film.<br/><br/>Yes, the film is in black and white, and it is better for it. Intense films are better in black and white than in color. While I don't agree with those who say film as a whole is better in black and white, the modern black and white films I have see have looked better than almost any color films. The sorts of directors who would consider making a black and white film long after the medium went out of style know when it's appropriate and when it enhances the experience. For reference, see Schindler's List and Memento By the way, I would have loved to see a black and white MM:FR. It would probably be one of my five favorite films of all time.<br/><br/>As for this film, it is firmly in my top 50. Maybe it'll even make it into my top 30. It's one of the greatest films of the decade. Note the contrast between the ring scenes and the outside-the-ring scenes. The ring scenes are stylized and electric. They pull out all the tricks in Scorsese's toolbox, and if there's one thing Scorsese is best at, it's drawing from everything done throughout the history of cinema while adding his own tricks, so that toolbox is mighty full. The boxing scenes in Rocky are fun, but they are child's play compared to this. The fights are atemporal. Time slows down and speeds up with the flow of the fight. It's much more like what is happening inside the fighter's mind than what is physically going on in the ring. Also present are the bright flashes of old-fashioned cameras, which Scorsese would once more rely on in The Aviator. Again, LaMotta's mental state during these fights make the bulbs stick out more than they otherwise should have.<br/><br/>The outside-the-ring scenes, however, utilize long takes. If it weren't so gritty and profanity-laced, I might be fooled for a couple minutes into thinking I'm watching a Woody Allen movie. When the film snaps back to the ring scenes, it's both startling and exhilarating.<br/><br/>As a piece of filmmaking, Raging Bull is unparalled. It's a marvel to watch. This is a film I'd love even if I had to listen to it in an unknown language. It also avoids Scorsese's 'weakness', if you can call it that, which is overemphasizing technical and stylistic marvel over genuine emotion. Here, technical side of the film, as well as the film's lofty, epic ambitions, flow perfectly into its emotional core.<br/><br/>This film left me stunned and astonished. Perhaps the word masterpiece is used too often these days. I'm indifferent on the issue. But even if it is, this is one of the films truly worth of that lofty title. In many ways, it is the pinnacle of American filmmaking."

","first off I liked the movie very much,, I don't think it was Deniro's finest , but he was very good to say the least.. I like Cathy Moriarty in here also,, Joe Pesci is you're basic tough guy you just have to have in a movie like this,, the movie is about a boxing champ Jake laMotta from the 1950's I believe . lot's of good stock boxing footage, but most of the movie revolves around Jake's personal life, and how throughout the movie his life slowly starts to disintegrate around him,, he especially treats his wife like crap, it's really hard to feel any sympathy towards the character after you see just what happens to his wife in several of the scenes.. I also love the entire length of the movie being shot in black and white,, I don't' know why it was done that way but I like it,, another Scorcese DeNiro, success,, it's a sad story,, but very good ."

","Raging Bull is one of the best movies Martin Scorcese has made. This is also one of the best dramas I have ever seen. I think it deserved more than the two Oscars it won. At least Robert DeNiro got his well-deserved Oscar. Despite this film being about a boxer and that there were boxing scenes in this movie, this movie is not a sports movie.<br/><br/>This movie is very much about a guy, Jake La Motta, who is one of the best boxers out there. Despite the unrealistic boxing, this movie shows what kind of character Jake is. It shows how he is emotionally unstable and how he destroys the lives of the ones he loves including his brother and wife.<br/><br/>The acting is just out-of-this-world. This is the finest acting performance I have ever seen Robert DeNiro do. Joe Pesci and Cathy Moriarty deliver very strong performances as well.<br/><br/>This movie shows why Martin Scorcese is one of the greatest directors ever in cinema. He proves that by making movies such as this and Taxi Driver.<br/><br/>Overall, I really loved this film even though I am not a fan of black and white. I rate this film 10/10."
"LeroyBrown-2","10","2","4","25 October 2007"," One of the Greatest ever
","There's a saying that a bad movie never feel short enough and that a great movie never feel long enough. This movie is great and even at 2 hours and 9 minutes it never felt slow. It is about one time middle weight champion Jake LaMotta it is a biography and a character study. We see a man that is a product of his environment, his outlet for what this environment has created and his eventual downfall, possibly because he never truly escaped his environment, and finally, eventual self realization.<br/><br/>What we see in this movie is that Jake LaMotta is indeed a product of his environment. He came from a volatile environment one where violence is common. A lot of his problem is faced and handled through violence whether it be dealing with his wives or his brother. From what we know now it is safe to assume he and his equally volatile brother learn this behavior from their father. Jake has an outlet for all this rage, boxing. He's a ferocious fighter who would willingly kill an opponent if given the opportunity. One fighter was treated ferociously because Jake's wife commented on him being good looking. As for the way he treats his wife, Jake treats her as the classic Alpha Male to the extreme. He is possessive and jealous, paranoid to the extent that he always has to know why she talked to certain men and who they were.<br/><br/>Jake's environment is also filled with ""wiseguys"" and he tries to distance himself from them, but his brother joey is friendly with them. As a matter of fact so was his wife, Vickie. We would see that even though in his boxing career he tried to stay away from the mob he could not completely and it almost prevented his chance at a championship. In the end even though he never became a 'wiseguy' he acted like one and it would bring about his downfall.<br/><br/>Martin Scorcese's direction is crisp and brilliant. He knows when to move the camera to make the film look like it had tremendous kinetic energy and he knows when to just allow the camera to stand still and let the actors act and the story unfold. The script, particularly in the case of Jake, does not divert to other things. Every word spoken by Jake tells you about Jake. And every word spoken by Jake is that of a man who is volatile, unpolished, domineering person, who believes he must have things his way.<br/><br/>The acting is superb, Robert DeNiro as Jake is brilliant. We see the volatility. When he paces while angered he seem to be a caged untamed animal looking both to escape and to pounce on whoever is foolish enough to get near him. Joe Pesci is great too. Long has he been seen as just a minor player in the Deniro/Scorcese movies but in truth he is as important a member as the other two. This was Cathy Moriarty's first film and she too was brilliant it is very surprising when you consider that she was twenty at the time.<br/><br/>Overall this film truly deserve all the accolades that it has received. It is a great film, brilliantly directed and acted, that shows how his environment shapes a man and how it affects his life and people around him."
"titan-stark","10","2","4","23 October 2007"," A Masterpiece in every sense
","Raging Bull shows you Hollywood at its best. u can find every aspect of a great movie. whether it is script, performance, direction, background score anything. Scorsese once again chose to show biography of a boxer Jake La Motta, which is brilliantly portrayed by De Niro, who besides fighting inside the ring fights another battle with his own paranoia. truly an Oscar deserving performance by De Niro. just wondering how can Scorsese missed out Oscar. Joe Pesci also played his part well as La Motta's brother. Film shows various aspects of paranoid behavior in daily life and its effects on lives of different people... even on the lives of people living with paranoid cases.<br/><br/>IMO... so far both De Niro's and Scorsese's BEST."
"dvc5159","9","2","4","12 October 2007"," Masterpiece. De Niro is an acting God....simply magnificent.
","Robert De Niro is probably one of the greatest actors ever. In this movie, he solidifies that statement, with gritty realism. Based on Ex-Middlewieght Champion Jake la Motta's life, the film chronicles the rise and fall of his boxing career, as well as his ups and downs in personal life. De Niro has given us one of the most powerful performances ever. He deserved the Oscar he won in 1981. De Niro is also a hard worker. I mean, he would put on weight and wear a fat suit to keep his character real!! An excellent example of acting is when La Motta accuses his brother and manager for sleeping with his wife. The dialog is fantastic, and the energy provided by De Niro is dynamic.<br/><br/>I understand that De Niro was helping director Martin Scorcese with drug problems during production. That's called determination. He worked so hard on the film that eventually he got rid of his drug problem. Sure, this has Scorcese-style over it, but not like Taxi Driver (another classic). This movie has a completely different feel over it, it's not feel-good and inspirational like Rocky, but rather, a realistic and tragic downfall that leaves us speechless. The fights scenes are also well filmed and edited.<br/><br/>Scorsese shot the film in black and white, beautifully portraying a certain era of misery and depression. The music is also good, whenever I hear the theme from Raging Bull, I get watery-eyed.<br/><br/>But of course, De Niro is not the only one whose good in acting. Cathy Moriarty gives a great performance as the abused and misunderstood wife, and Joe Pesci is just superb as La Motta's brother, Joey. Nevertheless, it is De Niro who still makes it to the top.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is a fine and iconic example of film-making art and will get better as time passes. It will stand the test of time and will still remain triumphant. Simply put, a excellent movie which will never be forgotten.<br/><br/>9.91/10 Delton."
"ChrisFennell","9","2","4","30 August 2007"," A masterpiece
","Watching Raging Bull is a truly exhausting experience. It is undoubtedly the most intense biopic ever committed to celluloid. The misogynistic and mascohistic Jake La Motta is a truly detestable figure, and hence some find it impossible to feel any emotional attachment towards him. Raging Bull is a very difficult film to love, but is easy to appreciate.<br/><br/>The delicate details from Scorsese, make the fight scenes impassioned but also wonderfully hyperbolic. Scorsese's ingenious idea of putting smoke under the camera and using Hershey's chocolate for blood make the fight scenes completely incogitable. Thelma Schoonmaker's Oscar winning editing is especially salient in these scenes.<br/><br/>In my opinion, De Niro's performance as Jake La Motta is the finest hour of his decorated career. 'Raging Bull' sees De Niro's ultimate immersion into 'The Method'. He gained 60 pounds and trained fervently so he could play Jake La Mota in the best possible way. As many have said before me, there are few moments in cinema that compare to a robed De Niro shadow boxing in slow motion to Mascagni's Cavalleria Rusticana."
"mcsheehey","10","2","4","4 July 2007"," What a Film!
","""Raging Bull"" is easily the greatest Scorsese film, as well as one of the greatest films ever made. It should have nabbed the Oscar for Best Picture.<br/><br/>Robert DeNiro stars in his second Academy Award-winning performance as Jake LaMotta, the factual boxer-turned-seedy nightclub owner. The film is really divided into two parts. The first part of the film focuses on LaMotta's rise to the top in the boxing arena. It also serves as an exposition of the characters, introducing us to LaMotta's future wife, played by Cathy Moriarty, as well as his brother Joey, played exceptionally well by Joe Pesci. There's especially a lot of foreshadowing of future conflicts in th story. The fight scenes are brutally realistic, and certain shots serve as perfect showings of the raging bull that was LaMotta. The move to shoot the film in black-and-white was key, being that it makes the film age better and rely on the older, better tricks to be great.<br/><br/>The two parts are really separated by a montage of colored home videos showing the growing relationship, marriage, and early parenthood of LaMotta and his stunning young wife.<br/><br/>The second part is the place where all hell breaks loose. The bull begins to rage, isolating himself first from his brother and then from his wife, both due to her unhappiness and promiscuous nature. The dialogue in this part of the film is perfect, revealing the characters all to the audience for what they truly are.<br/><br/>The acting is the real key to the film. DeNiro gives the best performance of the film, portraying LaMotta in a realistic and effectively brutal manner. Pesci and Moriarty, both of who earned nominations for Supporting Oscars, are superb as supporting players in the stellar plot. The cinematography and costumes also perfectly convey the time and setting of the film, which is set mostly around the time of World War Two. It's a superb film, and one of my all-time favorites.<br/><br/>I'd recommend this film to anyone age fifteen or older, male or female. This is due to typical Scorsese pervasive use of the f- word, extreme violence as times, explicit sexual content, and a movingly brutal plot. Still, for people who fit into the above-mentioned category, see this film as soon as you can! Note: (recommendations) If you enjoyed this film, you may also enjoy ""Pulp Fiction,"" ""Mean Streets,"" ""Goodfellas,"" and ""The Godfather: Parts 1 & 2."""
"MacBalthus","9","2","4","18 January 2007"," Now I really know, why Scorsese is called ""one of the greatest""
","Really now, I've seen ""Gangs of New York"" and was like ""Huh? And what's the big deal about this guy?"" I've lately bought ""Raging Bull"" and watched it a few times ever since. And I start to understand.<br/><br/>As I read in the booklet (God bless the Gold Editions!) Martin Scorsese was very sick before and during the shooting of this movie and also wasn't excited about the material at all. Robert DeNiro literally had to persuade him of taking a deeper look at it. After discovering his own self-destructive side during some time in the hospital, Scorses finally found his relation to Jake LaMotta and started to shoot. Or at least tried, because they had to force the producers into paying them, they used ""Rocky II"" to put pressure on them, but anyway, ""Raging Bull"" started. Maybe this is one of the big difficulties and one of the reasons, why many people don't get this movie. Even Scorsese didn't get it for a long time.<br/><br/>I don't know if I'm the only one who does it like that, but I start to judge a film already by its opening credits and damn, ""Raging Bull"" has surely some Top 5 opening credits of all times! It's absolutely hypnotic to see DeNiro jump and punch in the ring, all in slow motion with this beautiful music in the back. Ties you to the seat from the beginning. And it's necessary to tie the viewer to the seat with all these horrible scenes that come afterward. Horrible in the sense of the desired horror of a horrible person. The whole movie analyzes Jake's life. He treated his ex-wife, his brother and almost everybody else close to him very bad. Only in the ring he was at home and wanted the way he was. And so it feels in the movie. The boxing scenes are artistic, stylistic, even iconic. The rest is the filth of a bad life. Fights and beatings, arguments, destruction, torment. Jake LaMotta. And the audience must feel just like Jake LaMotta must feel while watching this movie: Uncomfortable. Bad. Just what the film makers wanted.<br/><br/>It is surely no secret that DeNiro delivers one of his absolutely greatest performances ever here. Most people only know about the 60 pounds he gained. But that's only the easiest aspect of his preparations for this role. He also trained about the year with Jake LaMotta and even fought 3 real fights in Brooklyn. And won two of them. He was in the shape to become a contender! He talks like LaMotta too. There is this interview where for only one second the young LaMotta comes back and Jake talks like in the old days. You feel strange because it seems, he's acting like DeNiro. Of course Joe Pesci and everybody else are terrific too but DeNiro is just a giant.<br/><br/>As a last aspect the artistic structure of some scenes: The third fight against Sugar Ray is shot in a bigger ring with fires burning under the camera to create this blurring and the smoky heat you can almost smell. The breath of Sugar Ray is a lion or a tiger. The shot of LaMotta's weak legs was made with DeNiro carrying another guy on his shoulders. Sorry but how much more creativity and brilliance can a director develop to make scenes like this??? Maybe some people first don't get the idea of self-destruction and second can't enjoy the uncomfortable feeling while watching this flick and give it bad rates because of this. It would flatter the movie when it really is like that.<br/><br/>I love the movie. It is a huge picture and will probably never be forgotten."
"ackstasis","8","2","4","7 December 2006"," Deserving Of Its Classic Status
","After hearing about the brilliance of 'Raging Bull' for months and months, I was delighted when I managed to find a copy of the film. Whilst I must honestly say that I didn't enjoy the film as much as many others before me, I can certainly see why it is considered a masterpiece.<br/><br/>First of all, the acting is absolutely flawless. Robert De Niro, in perhaps his greatest role (I'm still deciding between this and 'Taxi Driver'), stunningly portrays Jake LaMotta, a vicious and talented fighter but a paranoid husband. De Niro earned himself an Oscar for this performance, and it is easy to see why. The scene where LaMotta is thrown into a jail cell for selling alcohol to minors- overweight, disliked and alone- is one of the great acting scenes of all time.<br/><br/>The supporting performances are also very notable, especially Joe Pesci (Casino, 1995) as LaMotta's brother and agent, and Cathy Moriarty as LaMotta's husband.<br/><br/>The boxing scenes, though unexpectedly scarce throughout the film, are moments of utter beauty, and a testament to outstanding direction, editing and cinematography. The viewer is cast within the boxing ring, and they flinch with every blow, as if struck themselves.<br/><br/>In watching this film, it is essential to first understand that this is not supposed to be a ""boxing film."" In other words, you won't be getting an inspirational, underdog film like 'Rocky.' 'Raging Bull' is a biographical character study of Jake LaMotta and a classical examination of masculinity. I must admit that I felt the film was a bit slow in some places, and had a drawn-out, anti-climactic ending, but I think that's merely because I was in a 'Rocky' sort of mood. With every scene, I found myself yearning for another of those brilliant boxing scenes, and I was slightly disappointed when we find LaMotta overweight and lazy - a sure sign that his boxing days were now over...<br/><br/>I've heard that 'Raging Bull' is a film that benefits substantially from a second viewing. With my expectations of another 'Rocky' put aside, I think I can appreciate this film a lot more, something that it certainly deserves. So this is what I'll do: I'll give it a few weeks, and then I'll try the film again. You'll be hearing from me soon!"
"CalDexter","10","2","4","28 October 2006"," The perfect film about a man's self destruction.
","This is one of the most beguiling and emotionally upsetting films about a violent man's self destruction i have ever seen.<br/><br/>Martin Scorcese's masterpiece is like a violent 'Life' magazine turned three dimensional.<br/><br/>The fights that Jake La Motta has in the Boxing Ring with Sugar Ray Robinson are filmed like brutal stormy images in Hell.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro would not turn in a performance like this until 1991's Cape Fear. His Jake La Motta is mesmerising from start to finish. Now and again i think about that terrible sequence where La Motta is facing his shadow against a Jail Cell Wall, then starts beating his fists in a rage and screaming 'why' at himself. Lots of people always remember that scene.<br/><br/>Plus the moment where La Motta lets himself be beaten to a pulp by Sugar Ray Robinson is the turning point in the whole film. The character's downfall is horrible to watch both mentally and physically but that is the essence and power of this savage and brutal story.<br/><br/>Special mention must go to Joe Pesci as La Motta's brother Joey, who does well as the alienated sibling who ends up abandoning Jake because of his terrible assault on him for suspecting an affair with Jake's wife Vicki.<br/><br/>See this film. It is a Masterpiece.<br/><br/>Ten Out Of Ten"
"tonispatman","8","2","4","17 August 2006"," A teach for our life
","As Deniro said in the movie first you reach the top of the mountain and the you fall.This man he had everything ,he was a champion he had a divine woman a lovely family .He tried hard to win all this but in the end he acted with no thought and in a moment he lost everything.The story show as that if we are not grateful of what we have then we don't understand the value of what we have.And if we don't know what we have we can loose everything in a moment.Also if we act with anger and with no self-restraint we can harm our self and the people we love.The only way to fix this situation is the forgiveness.If De Niro would ask sorry from his brother who was injured by him ,then his brother would forgive him and he would safe him from his upcoming downfall.This is a good lesson of life especially for our young age."
"Voice-in-the-Machine","7","2","4","24 June 2006"," Brilliant cinematic achievement, but falls short.
","Raging Bull is at the same time a brilliant movie and a disappointment. People are correct when they say that DeNiro's performance as La Motta ranks as one of the greatest of all time, but great acting does not necessarily equate to a great movie, and the weak script ultimately overshadows both DeNiro's performance and Scorsese's directing to result in a movie that falls short of it's potential.<br/><br/>Scorsese tries with all his might to hold the movie together with arguably his best directorial performance. It has all the classical aspects of a Scorsese film: beautiful editing, superb camera work, great score, stunning visual sequences. But as mentioned, the real standout is DeNiro's acting. The rage and passion that La Motta shows towards every aspect of his life flow effortlessly from DeNiro, and as a viewer you are unable to separate the actor from his role, which is a sign of a great performance.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the subject material was just to vast to fit into a 2-hr movie. Huge parts of La Motta's life fly by in montage sequences; new phases in his life last a few minutes before they are uprooted to further the plot, and what began as a character study ends up in a race to sum up his entire career. In the end the movie seems to be a collection of snapshots of La Motta's life and career, with a few short scenes thrown in to try to depict La Motta as more than just a paranoid masochist. But these scenes are few and insignificant when compared to the vast majority that illustrate his explosive violence and rage, and the resulting one-dimensional character, coupled with an event oriented plot, leaves the viewer unable to fully relate to or sympathize with La Motta. Even if certain scenes were to invoke emotion, time flies by so fast that the viewer is left little time to fully process where the story is headed.<br/><br/>Overall I feel as though these shortcomings are direct results of trying to create a movie around an autobiographical novel. When the director is constrained to tell the truth, there is very little leeway to modify the script as might be necessary to improve the enjoyment of the viewer. I think unfortunately is boils down to the fact that as presented, La Motta's life is just not as magnificent or as entertaining as some of the more recent movies that tackle this similar ""rise and demise"" plot structure, and so the movie fails to entertain to its fullest capacity. It's neither a straight character study, nor is it an overly compelling story, and so it remains unable to satisfy the viewer in either way. <br/><br/>Despite these pitfalls with the plot, Raging Bull still rises above the average film by its gorgeous directing and brilliant acting, and when viewed from this angle, remains a must-watch movie for any fan of the cinema."
"PaulNewmanIsDead","9","2","4","24 June 2006"," Brilliance...sheer brilliance.
","And that's the best way to sum up this breathtaking film. Not only does Robert De Niro give his absolute best performance of his career, but Scorsese's direction is perhaps the greatest of his storied career as well. This film manages to strike a nerve with the audience and come off as incredibly unique because of not only the films different take on the classic narrative structure, but the gritty black and white add a sense of surrealness to the entire picture, making it seem like a gritty nightmare. The boxing scenes are probably the greatest to ever be photographed, and perhaps the most brutal. Joe Pesci chimes in with HIS best performance of his career as well. However, make no mistake, while this is a brilliant piece of art, it's still not the best boxing film to ever be made; that honor goes to Rocky. I will however say, that this is perhaps the best movie to ever be made ABOUT a boxer."

","I actually saw this film because of its reference in an episode of ""Celebrity Deathmatch""; I had heard of it before, but, not knowing a thing about real fighting, figured I wouldn't have a clue of what was going on. Though I'm glad I did see the film, my initial thoughts were dead on.<br/><br/>Watching this movie, I was never really sure why everything was going on, or sometimes even what was going on.  Granted, I still know very little about the real Jake La Motta, but since this is a film appealing to a broad audience, shouldn't such loose ends should be tied up? I got the basics of the ups and downs in La Motta's life, but the details are what makes the basics so interesting, and I just didn't get a lot of the details.  On a lesser note, the sudden switches to color for the home movie segments are also unnecessary, although it did at least tell me that those parts were in a different time, lest I be even more confused.<br/><br/>Whether or not I got all the plot, the acting was simply incredible.  The intensity, focus, and eventual breakdown De Niro shows as La Motta are amazing, and the lengths he went to in weight differences and learning to box for the part show an admirable dedication to acting.  The other La Motta's show equal intensity and anger, and most of the other characters also show above-average acting, although it's not as apparent because De Niro is so magnificent.<br/><br/>My father told me that this wasn't so much a movie as it was a showcase for Robert De Niro's acting.  While I have to disagree on it not being much of a movie, I will agree, since I still can't decipher all the plot's fine details, that the main reason to see the film is without a doubt De Niro's acting, which is, again, simply amazing."

De Niro deserves a 10/10 for his acting, but the plot seems to lack substance.  There was too much repetition of scenes in the film, and when the second hour begins, I couldn't help but say, ""haven't I seen a similar scene or heard the same line 6 times in the last hour.""  Some may feel that this repetition was essential to build-up the tension, but I think after the first hour, most educated viewers should have already gotten the point. Besides this detail, I thought the film was very good and I give it an 8/10. People should watch this if only to experience the superb job that De Niro and Scorsese have done.  Joe Pesci was very good too, but not as good as his role in the movie Goodfellas."

Fortunately of course, the flaw the Amish women choose to leave is something trivial not fatal.<br/><br/>It is this analogy that I think of after viewing Martin Scorsese's RAGING BULL.  The only problem is the flaw that Mr. Scorsese left in was akin to omitting an entire seam.  And the quilt unravels.<br/><br/>RAGING BULL is masterfully filmed, masterfully acted, and masterfully written.  It is genius.  But it lacks sympathy for the characters.  The viewers are unable to make an emotional connection with the characters on the screen.  Watching the story (viewing the art) is only half the requisite.  Viewers should be allowed to experience the story (experience the art) via making an emotional connection.<br/><br/>This was a fatal flaw.

I have had this trouble with a number of Scorsese movies; I appreciate the skill that Mr. Scorsese has, but simply cannot get myself emotionally involved in his characters.  This movie is supposed to be a tragedy, but how can it be tragic if we do not sympathize with the main character.  De Niro's jail scened, where he hits rock bottom while raining blows on the wall and shouting ""No! No! No!"" should have been heartbreaking.  But it just wasn't.  Out of all the characters in the movie, LaMotta was the only one I didn't like.<br/><br/>Most people say that this movie was robbed of Best Picture by Ordinary People, but I believe that movie is much more emotionally involving, much more real, and much more enlightening.

Of course, he would torture himself even more. In order to be closer to the character in appearance, he can buy thousands of costumes and props. He can go to the steel factory to work, or he can build a muscle and immediately destroy this with gluttony. Body muscles.
The title of the film is also very handsome. De Niro is wearing a cloak. I do n't know whether it is sweat or rain. It is so exciting under the dim light. I am preparing for the activity on the boxing ring. Audience, headed by three very thick horizontal ropes on the boxing ring, enclosing De Niro inside, De Niro's movements were shot at high speed, so this picture seems to have a clear metaphor, De Niro just Like a beast in a cage, he was active and roaring, but to no avail, Martin's movie was the false opposite.
The four sentences of La Merta in ""Raging Bull"" I think it can summarize his life of choice, success, failure and beginning again."

","It's interesting how the protagonist of Raging Bull is almost completely unlikeable, yet you still want him to succeed. Robert De Niro does a great job of losing himself in the character of Jake LaMotta, and this is before Joe Pesci went full Joe Pesci, which is interesting to see.

","This Scorsese-Classic shows us an unsympathetic protagonist, who deserves nothing better than what the movie shows us. We don´t really want to see a happy ending for him but the movie manages to keep our eyes on the screen anyway. Although we don´t cheer for La Motta, we want to see what is going to happen next. Our eyes are watching him beating his wife, his brother, being an awful human and an even worse father, but we still want to see how the story ends. We don´t want to see him living a live in harmony, we want to to see him getting what he deserves.<br/><br/>Scorsese and DeNiro´s fourth colaboration can easily keep up with ""Taxi Driver"" or ""Mean Streets"".<br/><br/>8/10"

","IMDb Top 250: 75<br/><br/>I've heard a lot about Raging Bull. One of the best movies ever; best acting performance ever; robbed of Best Picture; its accolades are intimidating. So when I finally found it on Blu Ray, I gasped out loud. It had found me, and I was going to see the ""best sports movie ever made"".<br/><br/>I made myself a snack, customary of any movie for me. I went to my basement, put the disc in my player, and started it up. Instantly, I was engaged: the menu, with De Niro warming up alone in the ring, a saddening orchestral melody; I knew this was going to demand my full attention. I ate my entire snack before starting, I didn't want to miss anything. I started: the old, fat LaMotta, rhyming to himself. Then BAM! fighting, 20 years earlier. This was it, a milestone in American cinema.<br/><br/>Then the disappointment began. There was talking, and small fits of rage, but as the film progressed, I got... bored. Scorsese has never bored me. And the worst part was, I didn't know what was so bad! I've enjoyed old films, even silent films, but Raging Bull couldn't capture my attention. I waited, maybe it's about his descent, spiralling out of control, but no. He wins some fights, loses some, fights a few people, including his brother, a highlight of the film, loses the last fight, retires, goes to jail, then finds himself alone. There's no major catastrophes, minus the fight with his brother, and other than the boxing it's not exciting.<br/><br/>There are still good things: I wouldn't award an 8 if there weren't. As you've probably heard, De Niro is amazing. After watching several bonus features, I can say he truly becomes the man, Jake LaMotta. He looks like him, fights like him, and probably thinks like him.<br/><br/>Joe Pesci is great, and he is almost as volatile as his brother in the film.<br/><br/>The use of black and white sets the film apart, and it feels right out of the 40's. However, the story stretches to the 60's, and the black and white feels a bit awkward then. I don't understand why the home movies are in colour. Maybe it the scenes with post-boxing LaMotta used colour, but diluted, an effect of evolution could occur.<br/><br/>Lastly, the boxing is awesome. Brutal and visceral, the boxing stands out and makes the scenes outside the ring weaker in comparison. In turn, the editing is great, making the boxing believable.<br/><br/>Usually, I can write a review soon after seeing a film. But not Raging Bull. I needed time to assess what just didn't work with me, and after my lacrosse game, when I was sick of working and felt like yelling at everything that just wasn't right, I figured it out. What makes his story so special? What did Jake LaMotta do to attract the attention of De Niro? It's obvious he has psychological problems, but it never feels like he's going to lose it in the film, and just destroy himself. The write-up says he obliterates opponents, and his family and friends, but he doesn't really, only yells and in one extreme scene hits them, but not intensely. This is a realistic film, with few stretched truths, but that could be one of its fatal flaws. By telling it like it happened, we doesn't feel worried about what'll happen, because all the action outside the ring is contained. The one time where it's uncaged, the Jenaro fight, I was finally in awe. That was the only raging I saw in Raging Bull.<br/><br/>DeNiro is great, but the character he played is not. We have no sympathy for him. He's not a hero, he's not a villain, he's not an anti-hero, he's just a character. I'm sure there are other people in the world who did lose it. Maybe they deserve a movie about themselves. If Scorcese made a fictionalized version of this story, it could've been more shocking and intense.<br/><br/>Lastly, I was misled. The menu used a sweeping orchestral track, but it's never heard again. In fact, other than a few 40's tracks, there was no music. Music could've added an emotional impact to scenes that needed direction, to help us feel the right emotions towards the characters. Especially with the mixed thoughts towards Jake LaMotta, music could've been really beneficial. A film that absolutely ACED the use of music in scenes is Requiem for a Dream. That is just the perfect use of sound to match the pictures on screen.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Raging Bull couldn't live up to the hype I had for it. While De Niro and the fights were great, everything else was less than I expected. It's an important film that makes you reflect on yourself, but the intensity I expected just wasn't there. Leaving me with a film more appropriately called Trotting Bull. 7.8/10"

","Well another masterpiece from the maverick that is Martin Scorcesse. When I first saw this film I thought - ""Yeah, not bad could be better"". However the second time I watched it I realised the true meaning for it in today's ever contrasting society. The juxtaposition of humour and drama bode poorly to give the audience a whole disappointment for the film. Since I've only seen the film once I can't make a rating therefore I would qualify it for a rating of 2 out 10. Although this may be true, the colloquial use of dialogue and constant contamination of Robert De Niro a.k.a The Elephant Man brings in a truly masterful work of art that can be depicted as a film worthy of the rating 10 out of 10. It is in my true feeling that it deserves an Oscar or rather a Razzie award for the worst sounding film ever. Despite the abysmal acting there were areas of real talent and promise, which should be mentioned. Sound amongst other things were upon the most achieving I have had the ability to hear. For this it deserves some award to accommodate the appreciative writings of credits. The plot is relatively simple combining few words with crazy brilliantly adapted lyrics of music. Yes, and that is another part I must comment on the music it was appalling. So at best I would give this film 10 out of 10 and at worst 1 out of 10 so really it should be give 7 out of 10 hence forth I would agitatedly recommend this film. In conclusion it is my belief to award this film 4 out of 10 and consequently I wouldn't recommend it.<br/><br/>P.S. If you are afraid of bulls or bears I admirably recommend the purchase of the DVD however in contrast to what I have said if one admires the stagnant eloquent use of animals."

","I've returned to Raging Bull a number of times over the last 30 years, but unlike other movies I've come to enjoy (after initially disliking them) I never find anything more in it than the meager merits found in the first viewing. I like many movies that Scorcese likes, but I find his own work pretty feeble and desperate.<br/><br/>Raging Bull is structurally facile. It starts nowhere & goes nowhere. There is nothing for a viewer to discover, because Scorcese doesn't trust you to find it. He presents this movies symbol set overtly, so that none of that pesky 'searching' or individualized viewing is required. (""Ooh there's a religious image in the bg of the sex scene. I found the meaning!"") Scorcese is either enamored of these brutes or repulsed, but either of those viewpoints offers slim pickings for a viewer. When all is said and done a movie needs to offer more than a catalog of scenes depicting and embroidering a stereotype. <br/><br/>Movies can either deliver ideas or sensations. But viewers are now too ignorant to even figure out when ideas have been offered. Better to give them something showy; outbursts, near-constant violence, acting with a capital A, real human fat and 'pretty,' conspicuous camera work. These isolated conceits have become the traditional way of persuading lazy, inarticulate viewers they've seen a 'masterpiece!' There is nothing to pore over or to cogitate about when watching this movie. It accepts no meaning except that concerning violence.<br/><br/>In the insect world, this movies equivalent would be to force bugs to watch people step on roaches for two hours. This movie is for thoughtless viewers who can think of no better purpose for a movie than delivering sensation. Raging Bull is barren."

The movie roughly covers the last 10 years of his boxing career to his early retirement years.<br/><br/>Though it is based on a famous boxer, it is not really a boxing movie. This movie is about the internal fury burning within the boxer and how it affected his immediate family members.<br/><br/>The performances are outstanding: De Niro (LaMotta) and Pesci (his brother) played their roles with visible intensity.

","Raging Bull is a biographic film based on the memoir of the same name. It is based on the life of boxer Jake LaMotta and the viewer is granted access into LaMotta's prime and subsequent 20 following years. We learn that LaMotta (played by Robert DeNiro) is an Italian man with a skill for boxing in a particularly vicious and brutal style which, is not surprising, when we learn of the man he is outside of the ring. In the beginning of the film we meet a younger Jake who is in a tumultuous marriage. Him and his wife seem to be having a heated argument, and yet, his brother reminds him later, he's still a married man. This doesn't stop him however from pursuing a young (read: 15 year old) blond women whom he eventually courts and marries (of course, first, the viewer assumes he divorces his first wife).
The rest of the film's story isn't really much better. We are subject to various fight scenes where LaMotta occasionally loses (although he never falls) and more where he wins. However, more often than not the movie circles around his obsessive jealousy regarding his wife and the unfair treatment she receives. He is controlling and irrational and seemingly destroys his own life because of his insane jealousy, even at one point, fighting and alienating his own brother (who is perhaps the only person who has LaMotta's back).
Eventually, to the relief of this viewer, LaMotta's wife finally gets a divorce and moves out. LaMotta meanwhile is busy hosting comedy routines at a club and hooking up with very underage girls (read: 14 years old) as well as setting them up with older men. However, for once, things seem to catch up with LaMotta who is jailed for introducing older men to underage girls.
Does LaMotta ever really get his comeuppance? You can be the judge of that, because the film actually ends with LaMotta out of jail and ready to put on his comedy routine at a new joint (all while reminding himself he's still a champion).
Do we really need a movie about this guy? Personally, I fail to see the story or meaning or glory behind an athlete who beats his wife and treats everyone around him poorly. There's nothing glamorous about jealous rage (maybe in the ring there is, but that might just be lost on someone who doesn't appreciate sports anyways).
All this said, this movie was not poorly made. DeNiro is a fabulous actor, committing to the role so intensely he is nearly unrecognizable. His acting is superb and, somehow, even moving, despite portraying such a gross person. Scorsese is an excellent director who chose shots that evoked emotion. The jail scene in particular, shrouded in darkness that is highlighted even more against the black and white nature of the film, made me feel a large amount of pity for a character I grew to dislike. Other shots of the movie feel raw and real, especially the fights that occurred outside of the ring which left me with my mouth hanging open.
Was it one of the best movies of all time? Certainly you should be the judge of that. While I grew to dislike the story as well as Jake LaMotta and his tale, I found the editing, production, and acting to be outstanding. This movie definitely deserves at least one shot if you've never seen it. 5/10"

It's certainly excellent, but I think at least two of Scorsese's films on either side of this one -- ""Taxi Driver"" and ""King of Comedy"" -- are better.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro is truly impressive as Jake LaMotta, but, as so often happens with these biopics, the character he's given to play isn't all that interesting. Once he establishes that LaMotta was a boorish, abusive lout, the character has nowhere to go, and when I hear people praise De Niro's performance now, I almost always hear them talking about the weight he gained to play the role, not the performance itself. Joe Pesci gives the performance to watch in this film as La Motta's bullied little brother. He brings the film whatever emotional center it has. And Scorsese, who can sometimes do wonders with female characters, doesn't do so here; Cathy Moriarty's put-upon wife is window dressing.<br/><br/>What the movie does do well is provide a pitch-perfect illustration of what the American dream is to some people and what they're willing to sacrifice on the way to attaining it, and it does so with sterling black and white cinematography and cracker jack editing from Scorsese's long-time collaborator, Thelma Schoonmaker.<br/><br/>Grade: A-"

How on Earth can they justify the amount of *****ing the viewers come to expect and pay for, and at the same time keep the story and the characters believable? Usually, this just does not work.<br/><br/>But this does not mean that it never works. There is the odd film here and there in which the writers did find a plot device for justifying or even requiring frequent fornication. In Raging Bull the sex is not really happening, it is dreamt by our heroine (Cathy Moriaty) who is frigid when awake and, er, hedonistic in her dreams. Two psychiatrists observe her dreams using a special dream-watching machine. Needless to say, we join them.<br/><br/>Special effects are pretty good for the era as well. The story is engaging and actually makes sense(some films make absolutely no sense). It's a great start of Martin Scorsese's career, and I love it.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Martin Scorsese is a lousy story teller, and so he does not develop this idea much further. Scorsese's strength is style, waggonloads of style, although one can easily blame him for overdoing it in some of his pictures. In Raging Bull he keeps the balance.<br/><br/>Add to this racial stereotypes, a thoroughly useful woman, great character development, great acting and wonderfully written lines and you've got yourself an hour and a half of ""Please don't end!""."

","I've seen this twice. The first time it didn't impress me at all. I hated all of the characters, and why watch a film if you are not pulling for at least 1 person? I saw this in a theater, with good sound and a big screen. This is the best viewing experience that can be had, and usually this sometimes makes the film better than it really is. The setting did not help. I was underwhelmed. It was well made, but that only takes you so far. Platoon and Titanic are well made, but are Garbage. I need more than fancy cinematography and good acting. I need a good story and something to hang my interest in. I found nothing here of interest. I waited 4 years before sitting down to watch this again. This time it was on a big screen TV on VHS, with a good sound system and comfy chairs. I was even less impressed this time. DeNiro was still a jerk. The other characters were no better. It was very well crafted, but hollow inside. This second viewing was an ordeal. Not quite torture, but very difficult to sit through. I would not watch it again.<br/><br/>On my scale, with 10 being the Ultimate in Cinema, I would give Raging Bull a 5. It's merely Above Average, and that's being very kind to it. The rating is for the excellent creation of the period and for the black and white cinematography. There's nothing else to see here."

This should have been inundated with boxing, boxing,and boxing. Family matters are not necessary in this film except for a minute portion. Scorsese should have seen this flaw in the rushes. To me the film was just a crashing bore. Deniro and all were superb in their roles. The excitement is in the boxing scenes. Jake LaMotta is a living legend and his four fight with Sugar Ray Robinson are historical. They were not given enough attention as were his other bouts."
"Robert_duder","3","5","20","13 September 2008"," To each their own has never been so true. I am constantly amazed by people and how they differ
","It has been awhile since I reviewed a stone cold classic. As a movie fanatic with over 700 reviews under my belt I have been trying to see some of these classics for the first time. I finally watched Gone With The Wind (see my review) and loved it, saw Casablanca and was touched (see my review) and now I finally sat down to watch Raging Bull which apparently is considered my some to be the great film of all time...what a statement to live up to. I love Robert DeNiro, the man is a master at his craft, and Martin Scorcese for me is very over hyped. He has had a lot of hits and misses for me, I thought Taxi Driver, and The Departed, were brilliant but on the flip side he has directed some of my least favorite movies including Goodfellas (get over it I hated it), Bringing Out The Dead, Gangs of New York, and now this...considered one of his greatest? Now finally I have to say that I think Martin Scorsese is severely over rated and tries far too hard to make obscurity along with gratuitous violence, language, sex and anything else that can get a rise out of the average viewer. I mean if there was some sort of artistic merit for cramming the most obscenities into a movie than hand it over to this man but when did that ever make a good film? <br/><br/>Sadly this is considered one of Robert De Niro's finest roles when in fact I think he had one good scene in the entire movie. The rest of the time he was kind of an ass, beating on his women, going into paranoiac freak outs, and making no sense at all. He looks ridiculous as boxer Jake La Motta and the character is boring and I care so little about him, I can't even believe it. Amazingly Joe Pesci is actually pretty good as La Motta's brother Joey. I figured that Pesci would be no more than he was in Goodfellas which was a ridiculous character that does nothing but beat people into bloody messes and swear until your ears bleed but he actually turns in a serious performance this isn't completely ridiculous. Cathy Moriarty practically puts herself to sleep along with everyone watching this movie as the love of La Motta's life. She looks strung out and she is boring in the role period. I'd go on about the rest of the cast but they are hardly in it and they certainly doesn't make the movie any better nor really any worse because the script and entire idea behind the movie does that right away.<br/><br/>Anyone who considers Raging Bull a boxing movie or even BEGIN to compare it to Rocky needs their head examined. First of all there is nothing good about Jake La Motta. He is insane, and an abuser both mentally, physically, and a stone cold scum bag through the entire movie that somehow we are supposed to feel sorry for. He disgusts me more than anything and I guess that's an impressive performance. Second of all for the ten minutes of boxing in this movie it's hardly worth it. What do we get to see? A couple of knock downs and DeNiro beating people's heads in, in black and white. The black and white is a nice touch and I mean it does make the film seem older, more classic but it doesn't over shadow the horribly boring story, and the ridiculous hero they try to make out of someone who is a scum bag in every sense of the world. This movie may have garnered Oscar nods and made DeNiro more of a star but I would love to sit down with anyone and explain to me what entertainment or education or anything that comes out of this because to me it was amateur garbage period. 3/10"

","Jake La Motta, his violent temper wins him matches in the ring, but destroys his life outside of it. The film chronicles his life from rise to fame, to the destruction of it all. <br/><br/>Martin Scorsese is my favourite director, so some of my friends considered it a sin for me to have not seen this one until now. Some people here would even say the same thing. The film is highly regarded as one of the best films of the 80's, some people will even go further and say one of the best films of all time. I, not so much. <br/><br/>Yes, ladies and gentlemen, I did not love Raging Bull. In fact, I was completely indifferent to it for the entire first half. The film finally managed to grab my interest for the latter part of his career/life. To me, the most interesting parts were after his boxing career, when he was a fat rude jerk. <br/><br/>I can't fault Scorsese, because the film is expertly crafted from start to finish. The clever choice to shoot it in Black and White was a right one and the dedication that DeNiro put into the character is amazing. What Deniro did with the character and this role actors can only dream of today. Only one person I can think of today goes to the extreme lengths that DeNiro did for this role and that's Christian Bale. <br/><br/>DeNiro really does shine in the film, while Pesci plays his usual self, this time a little less psycho. He's calm cool and collected and it's nice to see these two together in something fresh and new (for me anyway). Cathy Moriarty is beautiful and puts up with all the crap and physical abuse that is given to her by the abusive and womanizing LaMotta. <br/><br/>I wanted to love it, and I think that's where the big trouble lies. The film didn't do much for me, like I said earlier it didn't really grab me until half way through, and by then I was really bored. Maybe the LaMotta story doesn't interest me enough to care. No where near my favourite Scorsese film, or even my Scorsese/DeNiro pairing. It's far from the worst though as well. <br/><br/>Let the hate begin."
"Michael_Elliott","Null","3","10","25 June 2008"," Masterpiece
","Raging Bull (1980) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Martin Scorsese's masterpiece about boxer Jake La Motta and his personal demons that caused him to lose everything won Robert DeNiro the Best Actor Oscar and the film remains one of the greatest ever made. From the opening title sequence to the end where DeNiro quotes scenes from On the Waterfront, this is a rather remarkable, if dark and depressing, look at a self destructing maniac and it's one of the best character studies of all time. This certainly isn't a film that you'll want to watch often considering how depressing it is but it will always be a strong entertainment when viewed. On a technical side this film is flawless from start to finish. The sound effects really stand out as their use here is unforgettable and they still rank among the best for any film I've seen. The use of Italian composer Pietro Mascagni music also hits the right mood as it contains a certain sadness, which fits the film perfectly. The boxing scenes are among the most brutal that I've ever seen in a movie. The final fight with Robinson is so brutal, violent and perfectly edited that you cant' help but feel the actor is really being beaten down in the film. Cathy Moriarty plays DeNiro's wife who he meets when she is fifteen years old and the actress must play her in different aspects of her life. Moriarty is just another example of Scorsese taking someone no one has really heard of and getting them to deliver a strong performance. The highlight for Moriarty is a scene where she's getting slapped around in a bathroom and she finally breaks in anger to try and put Jake in his place. Joe Pesci plays the younger La Motta and also shines very brightly. The rage he has to show, to a smaller level than La Motta, is great to watch and he really works well with DeNiro. As far as DeNiro goes, I'd say his performance here is the second greatest I've ever seen after Marlon Brando in Last Tango in Paris. Everyone knows about the weight gain, which is in itself very impressive but the true genius here is the prison scene where La Motta finally cracks and breaks down. The emotions that DeNiro show in this scene and the rage are something hard to watch but it's so fitting for the character and the film. The movie isn't easy to watch and there aren't any soft punches thrown but if you like in your face dramas then this here is certainly one of the greatest ever made."

Some boxer with a prosthetic nose has a few fights and goes fat. That's the thin excuse for a plot. The boxing scenes are very amateur in execution, none of them have the shocking realism of Rocky IV. The cast stand around begging us to respect the movie instead of acting. In a couple of scenes, De Niro can be seen sniffing the air: He's sniffing out an Oscar(R) but for sure he will fail. Self conscious performances abound. There is not a hint of realism as in Rocky IV. Rocky movies make you sit up and take notice. They move you. Raging Bull moved me, too. Right out of the cinema.<br/><br/>Raging BULL, indeed."

","First Mean Streets then Taxi Driver then this. Martin Scorsese is defiantly the most overrated director in history and De Niro is just a terrible actor. The Academy awards must have been high on something that year to give De Niro an Oscar for gaining weight. He was supposed to win an Oscar for best 'acting' not for best weight gainer of the year. People who don't see that must need some help. I agree with STAN39520. It should be burned (along with Taxi Driver), and if anybody else directed this or stared in it they would pay no attention to it. So what makes Martin Scorsese great, huh! To me, the only great films hes ever done are 'Cape Fear', 'The Aviator', 'Casino' and the 'The Departed'. I really felt like i was doing a sinful thing watching this piece of crap! One of the greatest films of all time they say, one of the 'worst' films of all time. A boxing film with hardly no boxing in it. <br/><br/>I think the only reason why Scorsese made this film is because of Taxi Driver losing to Rocky at 77 academy awards. I bet he said i can do a better boxing film than Rocky. Sorry Marty, Rocky won best picture, this and Taxi Driver didn't. 0/10 Awful"

","Raging bull is film that plays from to its strengths, with a strong lead, and very stylistic choices in shots and more obviously, color palate. <br/><br/>The film lies heavily on the award-winning performance of Robert De Niro as he portrays boxer Jake LaMotta, in a role fueled by jealousy primarily focused on sexual inadequacies, he sees in all interactions. However, this sometimes makes the film hard to watch as some instances of this within the film are hard to enjoy due to the very uncomfortable emotions they swell up with in its viewers. Other strengths are the framing of certain shots within the film, evident in some of LaMotta's boxing matches, which insures that no matter how many fights the film shows they never get tiring to watch. The film easily follows it decade spanning tale never missing a beat as to why each character's emotional circumstances.<br/><br/>All in all, its solid film, with its only failing occurring in my eyes with the uncomfortable nature of the story. And the sometimes hard to watch scenes of our protagonist perpetually making the wrong decisions due to his character's jealous mind.

The editing during the fight scenes are like no other, the long camera shots of domestic life are quaint yet tense, the performances both comical and incredible. A film such as this is the perfect combination of collaborative effort between director, editor, actors, and writers. The mounting dramas are countered with the simplicity of charming dialogue. The strong performances are countered with the throbbing music and dancing edits.

"Rickting","10","1","2","6 January 2016"," Scorsese's magnum opus
","Martin Scorsese is one of the best directors to ever stand behind a camera. Every frame of his movies shows a cinematic master firing on all cylinders. Of course, his many wonderful movies aren't perfect. Hugo and Taxi Driver are a bit too slow, Shutter Island and The Wolf of Wall Street go on a little bit and Goodfellas is a bit meandering, although all of those movies are very fine. Raging Bull is the one where nearly everything is perfect; a devastating, rage fuelled, borderline harrowing meditation on masculinity, inner demons and jealousy. It may look like a film about boxing, but it's really a character study showing Jake La Motta's battling his inner demons in the ring instead of his opponents. Although, it should be noted the fight scenes might be the greatest combat scenes I've ever seen in a film. Shot in black and white, Scorsese edits and directs RB to haunting perfection. Scorsese expected it to be his last major film and put a lot of effort into it. The result is his masterpiece.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro has likely never been better than he is here. He may rarely give genuinely good performances now and inexplicably decides to be in things like Little Fockers, but here he lives and breathes Jake La Motta. His performance is one of the deepest and most enthralling performances I've ever seen from any actor, and he deserved that Oscar. Everyone else in the film is great as well. As a screenplay, few are so powerful and intelligent. The best metaphor for watching the film lies within the film itself. The hard hitting boxing scenes which have to be seen to be believed sum up the film pretty effectively. It's a heavy, brutal and relentless assault on the viewer, and as a result isn't the easiest movie to watch, but it's very much worth the effort. If there was a better movie made during the 80s I would be very surprised. Overall, a masterpiece and something every film fan should see. Goodfellas may be higher on the IMDb Top 250 but this is Scorsese's best film.<br/><br/>10/10"

","""Go get 'em, champ."" Jake LaMotta tells himself right before the credits role of the 1980 box office flop Raging Bull, directed by Martin Scorsese, starring his life long friends and award winning actors Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. Despite it's shameful box office performance, (making only $23 million with a budget of $18 million), the movie is considered a classic and one of the best films of it's time. It was nominated for eight Oscars: Best Actor in a Leading Role (Robert De Niro), Best Picture, Best Film Editing, Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Joe Pesci and Cathy Moriarty), Best Director (Martin Scorsese), Best Cinematography, and Best Sound. It only won two of the eight Oscars (Best Actor in a Leading Role: Robert De Niro, and Best Film Editing). Many question why it did so bad at the Box Office despite it's great reviews and ratings, one of which landing it at #112 of IMDb's Top 250 movies of all time. Perhaps it lacked the ""feel good, underdog victory"" aspect related to Rocky (1976), or it could be that many movie-goers go to see films to escape from the harsh realities of life rather than be confronted with them. However, the use of black and white and lighting proves the film as one the of the best of it's time. De Niro's intense performance of a conflicted up and coming boxer dealing with not only the stresses of being an athlete but with his ongoing (and abusive) feuds with his wife (Cathy Moriarty) and manager/brother (Joe Pesci) prove he was unmatched at the time, deserving his Oscar. Despite the brutal, violent, and ultimately depressing themes of the film, the second collaboration of Scorsese and De Niro proves through it's acting, directing, and cinematography that it deserved to have done much better at the box office."

A wonderful depiction and portrayal of a just interesting character.<br/><br/>It's the boxer Jake LaMotta's life, the personal envy he goes through which transpires into his professional failures at times. Now, this is not a film about a boxing but is about a flawed man. His fall his rise and his redemption and getting on with life. A boxer who became a stand up comedian. <br/><br/>This is a testimony of acting, the physical transformation that Robert De Niro underwent for the role of Jake LaMotta is remarkable and is one that is helped, even 33 years later as a great symbol of submitting one self to a role. Robert De Niro, after this film was taken very seriously and was enlisted as a great actor hence. <br/><br/>The writing was good, if not great but the depiction of the written work was something stupendous. The supporting characters, be it Joe Pesci as Jake's brother Joey LaMotta or the lesser know referees in the boxing ring, were all great in the portrayal of their roles. The film flows so fluidly in emotions that it seems natural. An example, if I can take is that of Jake asking his brother Joey about Vickie, Jake's wife, when they were setting up a television. That scene was cool and many scenes like these were cool too. <br/><br/>The fights are wonderfully choreographed and the camera placement is a wonderful thing. Camera became a character and took me as viewer into the ring. The jabs, the punches and the blood that was oozing out, all seemed real. Damn the camera, damn the cinematographer, and damn the director. I damn them because such a thing would be hard for many to achieve and they have done a stupendous job. The shots are wonderful and iconic. Also, the choice of Black and White as the presentation Medium, unlike Colour seems to have set this movie apart from a regular film. It is intriguing and striking.<br/><br/>The sound direction is another aspect that is perfect, from the sound of camera flashes to the screaming of Jake in prison, it was all wonderful and it remained in head so long after the movie. Also, the background music which would almost go unnoticed if not given a keen ear to, has played a substantial role in elevating the emotions.<br/><br/>All in all, a well crafted and a perfect film that I believe is one of the best sports film and one of the finest performances ever displayed. Scorsese was considered a great film maker since this film, and even today stands above many as one of the finest film makers of our time. <br/><br/>Thanks to LaMotta for his own work on this, but more thanks to DeNiro and Scorsese for giving us one of the finest films ever. An undoubted 5/5 for this."

","Raging Bull is a magical documentary turned into a film. The film highlights the life of the famous boxer Jake La Motta played by the great Robert De Niro. The movie goes far beyond La Motta's path of greatness in the ring but also into his own personal bouts.<br/><br/>The movie is about a prize fighter Jake La Motta's rise to middleweight boxing title. La Motta's epic battles with Sugar Ray Robinson are only part of this award winning film. The movie also encompasses Jake's personal battles with his own jealousy issues revolving around his wife Vickie La Motta played by Cathy Moriaty. Through out Jake's rise and fall, his brother accompanies him and manager Joey La Motta played by Joe Pesci. The brother's relationship becomes strained when Jake's constant struggles of jealousy cause him to battle his own brother. Jake's goes from the top to rock bottom because his own self-destruction gives him his only knockout.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese creates a beautiful black and white film, which will stand the test of time. The lighting used in the film gives an authentic feel to the entire movie. The actors were Academy Award winning, led by Robert De Niro the cast worked masterfully together. De Niro set the bar as an actor in this movie. It is clear that De Niro truly lived as Jake La Motta during this film, not only can you see his perfection in his lines, you also see him work his craft with his own body. De Niro had to fluctuate his weight several times throughout the film just to give the authentic feel of a boxer's life and behind the scene struggles. This movie is more than a boxing film; it is visually stunning with the simplicity of black and white you feel like your ringside. <br/><br/>I believe the movie storyline was good but not great, while I was fascinated with the great acting I still found myself being unconnected to the characters. I was continually let down by Jake's character and felt little to no sympathy when he hit rock bottom. Although an autobiography has to stay true to its storyline, it can and should create characters the viewer can relate to. Scorsese does a great job working with what he had; the contrast between black and white along with home movies in color gave a realistic feel to the movie. Aside from my lack of connection with the characters this movie was still a knockout."

","The film Raging Bull came out in 1980. This film is based on a once poplar book. The film starred; Robert De Niro as the main character Jake La Motta, Cathy Moriarty as Vickie La Motta and Joe Pesci as Joey ( Jakes older brother). This film shows deep relationships that Jake has with his wife, family and himself. Jake La Motta is a boxer whom never seems happy with his life. Jake La Motta is an extremely jealous and controlling person. He could be considered as border line bipolar. Throughout this movie La Motta proves that he cannot have a trusting relationship even with people he loves the most. In the beginning, Jake is married to a woman that he does not get along with. Later, he meets a young woman named Vickie. Jake and Vickie get married, and eventually have three children. Jake wins almost every fight, yet he is left always wanting more. Jakes brother Joey sets up fight with an up and coming boxer that Jakes wife said was good looking. Although La Motta wins this match his life is falling apart. Jakes is paranoid and his life soon starts to spiral out of control. Ultimately he ends up losing what he loves the most, his brother, wife and children. Even though this movie is about boxing, prior knowledge of boxing and the time period is not required to understand the theme. My understanding of the theme is about a man who is consistently struggling with himself to find happiness. Jake La Motta never truly finds happiness in his life. In one scene Jake is talking to his brother Joey about his hands being too small. Jake thought that if his hands were bigger he could fight the heavy weight champ and really be happy. After Jake meets Vicki his second wife, he still is not happy. He is winning left and right but is still missing something in his life. Jake starts to feel like his wife is having feelings for someone else. Jake being the jealous person he is lets this feeling consume him. He accused his brother of having an affair with his wife Vickie. Jake beats Joey up and they do not speak for many years. I believe this film is about trying to find happiness and completing one's life: something Jake La Motta was unable to do. <br/><br/>Another film with the same theme as Raging Bull is The Pursuit of Happiness. Although the plots are completely different, the theme of finding happiness in a compromising situation is the same in both films. Two techniques that help communicate the theme are costume/makeup design and movement within the film. Raging Bull has many scenes where makeup is a needed. This film did a good job in making the injuries look real. Without the use of the special costumes and makeup effects the film would not have a dramatic feel. The theme of this movie can be tie in with many situations. Not only is this movie entertaining, it is able to teach a valuable lesson that many can relate too."

","Ladies and gentlemen please welcome the raging bull, Jake La Motta. This has got to be a film almost all of you would have heard of. It chronicles the rise and fall of boxing middleweight champion Jake La Motta. The man who was so powerful in the ring but so judgemental out of it. <br/><br/>The story begins with his first divorce. He struggles to control his temper with his wife and they argue ferociously about small issues such as the cooking of a steak. The rows begin to change his wife who begins to react to any comment he makes causing her to yell at him down the street from the window for all to see. The marriage is doomed from the moment we witness it. <br/><br/>His life begins to change though when he meets Vicki (Moriarty). She is a bubbly young girl who all the men want to be with, but she takes a liking to Jake and they begin to date. She follows his success in the ring and it looks like she takes every punch that he does. She is a young girl falling in love.<br/><br/>Over the years, Jake's happy life outside the ring causes him to excel in it. He fights his way to a position where no one wants to fight him. Once he reaches this point he seems to believe that it's his wife that wants to fight him. Inside of Jake a jealous monster is released.<br/><br/>There is great chemistry between Jake and his brother Joey (Pesci), the brother that idolises his sibling. He does anything he says including punching him in the face and siding with him over the jealous spats against his wife. Jake's jealousy really becomes apparent to us when his wife states that the guy he is fighting next has a 'pretty face'. Something Jake can't accept. In his fight with the guy he pummels his face so hard that afterwards he looks into his wife's eyes from the ring as if to say, 'he ain't pretty no more.' <br/><br/>After this Jake is given his title fight, which he wins, causing him to be away from home a lot. Joey is given the duty of keeping eye on Vicki and whilst doing this he causes a full on bar brawl in a posh venue because she is having drinks with friends. This is no business of Joey's but what his brother asks he does.<br/><br/>Later however, once Jake becomes aware of the brawl, he turns on his brother and suspects him of sleeping with his wife. This causes the two to fight and leaves the siblings parted. Jake continues his career without his brother and eventually loses in what would be his last fight. Years later a divorced Jake is a fat failed comic and his life has changed significantly. From being on top of the world he quickly becomes underneath it. <br/><br/>The film manages to show us lots of angles on his life. It isn't really a film about boxing, it is about jealousy and how one man can hold his temper in the ring but not out of it. How much of this is fact I will not know but if it is this man could have been something great but let it all go due to low self esteem and selfishness. He slaps his wife around and then his brother causing him to lose all he loves. To look at Jake la Motta at the beginning of the film compared to the end will show a significant difference to how this man has changed.<br/><br/>I keep referring to the man as Jake. As you will all be aware is that Jake is played by De Niro, but De Niro is that good that he IS Jake La Motta. He is brilliant, from the muscular boxer to the fat stand up. He hits every emotion brilliantly especially when he is locked in prison and realises what he has lost. Pesci is also brilliant and his chemistry with De Niro is as if they are real brothers. Some of their interactions, like in the accusation scene and the scene discussing that 'if he wins, he wins and if he loses, he wins', is top drawer and some of the best scenes you will see. Moriarty should also be mentioned particularly as she plays a middle aged woman with ease considering she was nineteen when she starred in this film. She starts off so bubbly and ends as if a prisoner, shown in a fantastic shot of her surrounded by mirrors. The acting was great, the script great and the story great.<br/><br/>My small qualm is with Scorcese however. I know he won several awards for this film and he is a fantastic director, but I have an issue with him. Every film he makes I continually spot continuity problems. Maybe I am just anal about it but with a film maker as brilliant as Scorcese these things shouldn't be happening. Sometimes it distracts me when I don't want it to.<br/><br/>I don't want to leave it on a slight downer though as it is a very good film. Don't watch it for boxing as you are not getting a Rocky, watch it if you want Rocky with a bit more depth.<br/><br/>4 / 5<br/><br/>Read more reviews at: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com"

","Robert De Niro & Martin Scorsese are a brilliant duo, and this might be their best collaboration! De Niro portrays Jake LaMotta, a raging and self-destructive boxer, hence his nickname ""The Raging Bull"". But actually the film isn't about boxing, that's just the setting. The real themes are paranoia and jealousy; about how a man desires a beautiful woman at first, but due to insecurity loses his touch with reality and dwells into mistrusting every move she makes. Freud called it the Madonna-whore complex, look it up ;) The performances are great, and De Niro rightfully received an Oscar for best actor. During this movie he transforms from a fit young prizefighter to an overweight retired old man, gaining an astounding 33 kg! But everything is right in this movie; the directing, the editing, the use of black & white, the camera-work, the supporting actors. Without a doubt a Great Movie and one of the best of the '80. <br/><br/>My score: 9.5 out of 10 Rating: R / Kijkwijzer: 16"
"SeptumSin","8","1","2","29 August 2010"," It is amazing what an additional viewing will do
","Well let me start by saying that all movies that I review have to be watched twice before I feel I can give them a proper review. Many movies go up and down in rating with a second viewing and sometimes one doesn't quite catch the point with that first view.<br/><br/>This is definitely the case for the movie Raging Bull. In short it is the story of a boxer and his rise to the top of the championship world as well as his inevitable fall from grace.<br/><br/>When I first saw this movie I said ""Ah Robert Dinero and Joe Pessie playing the wise guys again"" and kind of just let the move flow by. I felt bored by it. So my initial thought was ""What's the big deal?"" The second viewing was hard for me as I have a considerable amount of films to watch but I pulled myself back to it and was very pleasantly surprised. Dinero works well with the part that he was given and truly pored himself into the role. Though the actors were not really going outside the box for their acting the intensity was very top notch. The movie ia a long one but you can get engrossed into the storyline. Shot in black and white it lends an element of age to the film that also gives it an extra plus in the art department.<br/><br/>On the downside the movie can get away from you and leave you with that bored feeling if you arn't working to pay attention. I also have a hard time watching the anger on the screen that Dinero is so good at.<br/><br/>In the end this is a movie that is worth it so long as you make sure to have the energy to go into it. If you work with this film you will definitely not be disappointed."
"bryan_mcdade","10","1","2","29 July 2009"," truly a masterpiece
","raging bull is an absolute masterpiece, the acting, the script, the cinematography, all of the highest standards. de niro is excellent and gives a career defining performance as la motta, the fact that he put on a load of weight to play older la motta at the end only shows his dedication to make this role as real as possible, the speech at the end is my favourite piece of dialogue from a movie and he delivers it with heart wrenching honesty. raging bull is more a film about a man who boxes, rather than a boxing man(if you know what i mean) it shows how la motta who had all the tools to make it to the top, lost everything and the tragedy is he ends up a lonely fat old man. the fight scenes in raging bull are excellently shot and the fact they are in black and white, takes them to another level, often in the fights you get a first person view as the boxers fight, close up punches, sweat and blood, the fights with sugar ray are especially realistic. i don't feel raging bull would be the same without the films beautiful music which adds depth and emotion to every scene its on. overall raging bull is an excellent film, de niros best and scorsese best in my opinion. a true masterpiece."

","At first glance, the film merely seems to be a one dimensional portrait of a man who's anger and destructive nature is completely out of control, yes the acting is fantastic , and many in the audience go away happy that they have understood the gist of the film...<br/><br/>However, on repeated viewings , the true meaning of the film emerges .... all that really, truly matters to Jake La Motta is becoming the champ! Until he reaches that goal he can allow himself absolutely no happiness, no rest, no relaxation - only anger, rage, and frustration towards everyone and everything; because the powers that be say there is no way for him to ever become the champ!! Why is this?? Without first agreeing to participate in a fixed fight he can never achieve his dream - he is repeatedly persuaded by his brother to lose in a fixed fight so local mafia can bet against him and make money, and then, and only then, will they arrange it so that he can fight against the current champion (they control exactly who fights who). They want to put him against a terrible boxer who has no chance of beating Jake, so the fight would pay big odds.<br/><br/>Jake finally agrees to pretend to lose the match on purpose and take a fake fall - just so he will finally get a chance at his lifelong dream, to win the championship belt.<br/><br/>The climax and turning point of this film is Jake's own decision to sell himself out just to win the title - taking the fall against a bum he knows he could beat. In that moment he commits suicide, but he doesn't realize it yet.<br/><br/>After he wins the title, he slowly realizes that he's won a hollow victory, because even though he is now finally THE CHAMP and everyone treats him like one, inside he KNOWS that he is a sellout, he's lower than dirt, he compromised all his beliefs, he sold his very soul, and he can never get it back, he is permanently tarnished -- and that eats away at him, more and more - until he becomes paranoid and distrustful soul-less wretch towards everyone, angry at the world, finally falling into a self-destructive spiral because nothing can bring back his self respect. Is it any surprise that many regard it as the greatest American film ever made?"

"JackBenjamin","10","1","2","26 March 2009"," Rage that Drives the man
","I love films that not only survive over the years but that seem to adapt and change over time. It's really me changing as viewer but the film is so organic, if done right, that it has the appearance of a life of its own.<br/><br/>Having now gotten past the story, on this my 20th or so viewing, I've noticed the overarching thematic achievements. First is Scorsese's ability to capture the authentic energy of NYC. Not only that, but the energy of a certain era and ethos. It's not romanticized like it is in Goodfellas, at least not as much, and it's mimicked perfectly by Scorsese's cinematic energy: fast cuts in hectic places, slow motion where our eyes would linger or where memories would take form, and of course bottled, intense, volcanic acting.<br/><br/>LaMotta's rage is the subject of the film. It's what drives him to excel at his sport and it's what leads to the dissolution of every important relationship in his life. His rage is the gravitational center of his character. He's a bulldozer, not very complex beyond a layer or two, but that's the point -- he was an animal. A jealous, ambitious, self-righteous, bilious man who could never reconcile his family with his career and who never realized his misgivings until after the fact. Any lesser actor might not have been able to drive the film forward like DeNiro does, or to find that perfect blend of rage and tragedy after realization."

","Oh man, I had heard the hype, but nothing can prepare you for this monster of a movie. Let's get right to the point: this movie belongs to the DeNiro. From the opening credits, the audience knows that this guy is going to take us on a roller coaster ride, I mean it is that good. This is not an ordinary boxing movie, nor is it an extraordinary one; it is a character analysis at its best. Although the film's premise involves boxing, the overall thematic idea revolves around the human condition, in this case the self destructive DeNiro. Joe Peschi is also great, but not in a dominating kind of way, as he is primarily there to complement DeNiro; keep him dormant, although that becomes a daunting, if not impossible, task. Scorsese truly manages to capture the essence of the beast in DeNiro, and while I still think Goodfellas is his best film, Raging Bull is hands down the best collaboration between the two of them. This is an epic movie, I cannot stress that enough. No review can do it justice, as one cannot judge perfection. This is easily one of top ten greatest movies ever made, and that is an undeniable fact. Don't expect a subtle movie, because this is intense, in your face, entertainment. Watch the Raging Bull for the greatest performance of all time; watch it for the greatest collaboration of all time; just watch it end of story."
"weekly-movie-review","9","1","2","12 December 2008"," Not just a great boxing movie, a great movie altogether!
","Raging Bull is a poetic boxing movie based on Jake La Motta's autobiography. It details his rise to glory and fall from grace during the 40's and 50's. The central character is played superbly by Robert De Niro. In fact, De Niro established his name in legend when he gained an estimated 70 pounds during filming. Cathy Moriarty and Joe Pesci also perform at their absolute best as the wife and brother, respectively. Moriarty, with her deep, sexy voice, conveys a since of mental toughness that matches De Niro punch for punch. Pesci is his usual maniac self by showing amazing aggression and anger at times. But of course, none of this is possible without Martin Scorsese's direction. This is a true masterpiece, with black-and-white cinematography, an elegant soundtrack, and amazing costumes and props. The writing is fluid and thought-provoking and the story is as memorable as a Greek tragedy. This is one that all must see, whether you are a boxing fan or not."

","What first stroke me about this film was the way Robert De Niro's acting picked up on me. He made me uncomfortable and almost hate him because of his paranoia and the way he treated his wife and brother. Then during the fights (which are pretty intensive) he made me stand by him, expecting him to win. Latter on when he was working at his bar, he made me feel pity. Seeing it a second time two years latter all these feelings came along again.

"Red_Identity","Null","1","2","24 July 2008"," One of the best films ever made!
","I just saw Raging Bull, and to say the least, it is a revolutionary film. I always heard buzz about this film, and I have not seen many Martin Scorsese films, but this is a true American movie! The screenplay is a true force to be reckoned with. It reminded me a bit of other epic films like Citizen Kane and There Will be Blood, the way the main character plays out is similar, but this film is different, as in the character Jake La Motta is based on a real person. Martin Scorsese really commanded the screen. There are truly some amazingly written and acted scenes. This is a boxing film, but a very much human film too. Robert De Niro really gave his best, and it turns out to be one of the best performances I have ever seen! His performance ranges from his bad times, to his guilt, to his madness and anger. It is all played out perfectly. Joey La Motta, his brother, played brilliantly by Joe Pesci is also a strong supporting character, who follows Jake through a lot. Another strong character is Vicky Thailer, played by the back then unknown Cathy Moriarty. What these three characters go through is amazing. This film is a joy to watch too. Certain scenes, some sensuality between Jake and Vicky are not really sexually graphic, yet have so much pleasure in them, the way Scorsese teases us. Scenes like where Jake suspects Vicky and Joey together, and in their fight all of a sudden are so well done and acted, I could not stare away.<br/><br/>This film is from the 1940s through 1950s, so there are a lot of gorgeous set designs. The costumes, the cinematography are all beautiful too look at. The decision to make this film black and white really helps. There are amazing camera shots, amazing techniques that are used, and the sound in the boxing scenes is perfection.<br/><br/>This film is a classic for a reason. It is pure entertainment too, and it is so well done and executed no one can be disturbed. It is one of the most enjoyable, amazingly acted films I have ever seen. A film that everyone should see, if not for De Niro's amazing performance, then for the amazing writing and directing!"
"tharnax","10","1","2","22 March 2007"," Scorsese and DeNiro's Masterpiece...
","""Raging Bull"" stands out as an all-time classic, easily director Martin Scorsese's greatest work. The film chronicles the life and times of 1940's middleweight champion boxer Jake Lamotta. In stark contrast to Sylvester Stallone's ""Rocky"", this film is more visceral and even ugly at times. LaMotta's personal demons are exorcised in gritty black-and-white, his struggles and rage are fleshed out with unflinching realism. <br/><br/>The performances in this film are so relaxed, the viewer sometimes feels as if he/she is watching a documentary, a black-and-white reality show set in 1940's era Bronx. Frequent improvisation on the part of the actors also contributes to a sense of captured reality. This style of filmmaking has been widely imitated ever since; such realism in film was virtually non-existent at the time ""Raging Bull"" came to the screen. <br/><br/>Robert DeNiro gives the performance of his career as the iconic LaMotta. His performance earned him the Oscar for Best Actor. As the ""Bronx Bull"", DeNiro is tough and passionate. The viewer is drawn to care about this character primarily because of the strong personal connection formed as a result of the realistic, and totally original Scorsese exhibition. Witness the brutal odyssey of a struggling fighter, shot through with flashes of rage and violence. Jake's condition is all too human, his personality illustrated through various conversations and fight sequences. It is an angry and impatient portrayal, Jake simply wants to win, and to do so with his two fists and burning heart. Outside the ring, Jake is restless, impatient and defiant against the rigged establishment that keeps him from getting his title shot. Respect is paramount in Jake's world, any perceived sleight against him is returned with fiery anger. These issues of respect and retribution are instinctive to male viewers; every man can identify with another's struggle for respect and identity, as well as adolescent testosterone flare-ups and territorial immaturity in relationships. All of these essentially male experiences are magnified by Jake's boiling anger, which he unleashes in the ring with nothing short of ferocity. <br/><br/>This film avoids clear-cut resolutions. Jake's struggles continue long after his exit from the ring, through physical decline as well as divorce, his peace and happiness remains elusive as he plummets to a variety of lows throughout his retirement. The Mascagni score is passionate and this music provides a steady comfort throughout the peaks of Jake's life, creating an emotional and bittersweet counter-balance to his sad decline. <br/><br/>Joe Pesci's portrayal of Jake's brother Joey is also memorable. Joey's own bursts of anger echo those of his brother and Pesci's brilliant performance is a preview of his character Tommy in Scorsese's ""Goodfellas"". <br/><br/>Cathy Moriarty also shines as Jake's girlfriend (and later wife), Vickie. Scenes between Moriarty and DeNiro reveal genuine, and crucial chemistry between the two. <br/><br/>Above all, ""Raging Bull"" is a story brought to life by Scorsese's genius as a filmmaker. Alongside film editor Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese's cuts are imaginative and clever, action in the ring is captured up close and personal and shots are beautifully interchanged to create the right mood for each sequence. As mentioned before, the theme music for this picture is the Intermezzo by Mascagni, a gorgeous Italian piece which accents the bittersweet nostalgia of Jake's career and personal peaks, as well as underlining the sadness of his low points. <br/><br/>""Raging Bull"" continues to endure as a classic film as well as a milestone in movie-making. This picture is all heart."

"azrael41","10","1","2","19 November 2006"," Why Raging Bull is the greatest film ever made
","Of course this isn't a realistic statement to make, but this film is beyond the best film of the eighties, and indeed I think it tops all the most frequently mentioned top American Films, most notably Citizen Kane, The Searchers, and Scorsese' own Taxi Driver. Indeed the closest thing you can compare it to is Bergman's persona. This film is not only a powerful and impossibly well crafted story, it is a stylistic breakthrough for a cinematic artist who had already taken international cinema by storm. Indeed, here we see emerge the fully mature Scorsese, who couldn't have gone on to make Goodfellas or the Departed without making this film first. While he always had a mastery of subjective photography and slow motion, in Raging Bull his camera is so fluid, so reluctant to stop moving, that you can almost hear Max Olphus weeping for its freedom. <br/><br/>One reason Citizen Kane is so amazing is the performance of Wells, who at the age of 25 plays a man who ages from twenty-five years old to an elderly man. Wells as a director used make-up to produce his effect, but Scorsese had a method actor whose commitment to this part led him to stop production for weeks in order for him to put on enough weight to play an aging, fat LaMatta. This effect is rendered in sharp contrast immediately, in the first cut of the film, from 1964 to 1941, where LaMatta is in peak physical condition, as is De Niro, who for these early fight scenes is perfectly chiseled. <br/><br/>What Kane did in 1941 was give us a model for the potential of the talkie. What Raging Bull did in 1980 was give filmmakers a new vocabulary for personal film-making. This is not your old school Hollywood drama, like Ordinary People, which beat Raging Bull for the best picture Oscar that year. This is a film that gets into the head of its subject. It manages to present the thoughts, feelings, and actions, of an incredibly complex and insecure character, in a way that lets the audience maintain their own sense of morality and outrage, yet makes the subject more empathetic and consequential. Where most biography films highlight the subjects achievements and gloss over or erase the improprieties and ugly marks, Raging Bull revels in them. <br/><br/>Pesci gives a performance that no other actor in history could have gotten right. It's possible to envision this film with someone else playing LaMatta (a young Brando comes to mind), but not Joey. No one could deliver these lines with such conviction and emotional significance. For instance, when Jake asks Joey if he slept with Jake's wife, Joey responds, ""I'm not gonna answer the question. It's a sick question, you're a sick f***, and I'm not sick enough that I'm going to answer it."" What Pesci does with this material is nothing short of remarkable. He is so familiar with his brother's behavior at this point, he is fed up with it, yet he knows he has to select his responses very carefully, or he will only make matters worse. And underneath this is still concern for his brother, to whom he stays loyal despite endless reasons to throw in the towel.<br/><br/>This story is presented in an unflinching and entirely naturalistic manner, except for the fight scenes, which abandon any sense of naturalism to produce a surrealistic and completely animal portrayal of combat. The soundtrack is very dense, containing animal noises, lion roars, bird shrieks, screaming audience members, and shattering panes of glass evoked by the bright flash bulbs of the ring side photographers. The camera stays in the ring, like a third fighter, weaving in and out of the fight. Scorsese and his editor Thelma Schoomacher use sophisticated matches on action to produce chaotic movement. One virtuoso shot, perhaps one of the best ever put on film, shows LaMatta breaking away from Sugar Ray Robinson, he backs away from the fight, the shot is consumed by slow motion, a heightening awareness, and then, back to normal speed and the fight resumes.<br/><br/>This is a rare film because all the different elements of its production, the writing, acting, photography..etc, fit perfectly together as if they were meant to be as they are. But what puts this film above almost any other ever made, is that it is a beautiful and moving expression of an artistic soul in great turmoil. Scorsese had just endured a complete collapse due to his drug use. This was the first film he made after he recovered, and he has said that at the time he thought it would be the last film he would ever make. So he chose a film that expressed his love and obsession for the cinema as well as one that expressed his great anger, his pride in his heritage, his commentary on the contradictions of the men of the generation before his, and most importantly, where he wanted to go. There is some of this film in every film he's made since, and in some sense he's been remaking the film over and over again. And it ends where it started, with an old, washed up Jake. But at the end, we realize we've never seen him happier. He had achieved, after everything, some strange form of enlightenment. Maybe Scorsese wasn't there when he made the film, but it's where he wanted to end up."
"Roger_Sterling","10","1","2","20 July 2006"," The raging bull that was Jake LaMotta.
","As another reviewer put it, Raging Bull is ""easy to admire, difficult to love"", and he is dead on, but I loved it, but not without being heavily conflicted over it. Sure, I still gave it 10/10, but that means excellent, not perfect. Some scenes are uncomfortable to watch, even by myself, such as when Jake smacks Vickie. Robert DeNiro's finest performance by far, he earned that Oscar for best actor. Joe Pesci should have won best supporting actor, and Cathy Moriarty should have won best supporting actress. It's ridiculous to think that to this day Martin Scorsese still hasn't won best director; he should have won it for this movie. I haven't seen all of his movies, so I can't say if this is his best, but I don't need to see the rest to say this is definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen, and one of DeNiro's best."
"Spuzzlightyear","10","1","2","9 July 2006"," I Could Have Been a Contender.. Well, wait.. I WAS one at one point..
","Raging Bull is one hell of an amazing movie. From the truly 'This is how acting is done' performance by Robert Deniro as Jake LaMotta, Cathy Moriarty as his long-suffering wife, and of course Joe Pesci as his brother, to the truly awesome directing by Martin Scorcese, the movie follows the rise and slow, then steep fall of Jake LaMotta. Someone who I hadn't heard of before this movie (and that was when the movie came out!). I tell you, this movie is a lot of fun to watch. Because DeNiro's LaMotta is just a timebomb waiting to explode most of the time over the pettiest thing (Usually over the wife). Also worth noting is the amazing black and white cinematography of Michael Chapman. Although I don't really say this about movies, but I am in awe of how certain scenes are set up (Like when Pesci and his family are eating dinner and LaMotta comes charging into his place. You can literally see Lamotta entering from a mile away). Fun fun fun! What more do you want from a movie?"
"WhatsYourPoint","10","1","2","7 July 2006"," Never compromises it's beauty; never compromises its ferocity.
","Most Martin Scorcese fans will remember him for his 1990 film Goodfellas. Others believe that his greatest achievement lies within the confines of Taxi Driver. And then there are other fans, who fall into another camp, one that will always remember the genius that he exuded on another film. That film is Raging Bull, his most poignant and beautiful, yet unrelenting, film.<br/><br/>Paul Schrader's superlative script gives us insight into the life of Jake La Motta, played by Robert De Niro. De Niro puts forth bestial nature of the boxer so brilliantly and puts forth so much effort to become him; he even gained sixty pounds for the later scenes! To only praise De Niro would be a crime, though. Joe Pesci holds his own against the titanic De Niro and provides an antagonistic camaraderie toward him. Cathy Moriarty, who plays La Motta's wife Vickie, is perfect and acts as a voice of reason against La Motta's paranoid delusions.<br/><br/>Raging Bull is violent and vicious, yet somehow there is a great beauty attached to it. The black and white cinematography is amazing, with its long takes and shots. The boxing matches are the best ever filmed, making the sport seem akin to ballet. The animal sounds thrown in to some of the fights reminds us of the brutality of the sport, and of La Motta. But some of the beauty would not be achieved without the music from Pietro Mascagni's opera Cavalleria Rusticana. This extends Bull to operatic heights.<br/><br/>I love Goodfellas, even though it is a little overrated; I like Taxi Driver, even though it is overrated too. However, Raging Bull exceeds all expectations and becomes Scrosese's best film. Bull is the best film of 1980, the best film of the 80s, and probably the best film of all time. Scorsese presented a masterpiece that has not been matched since its release. And to think that he didn't even want to direct it because it was a ""boxing movie!"" Thank God (or really thank Scorsese) that this extraordinary director managed to helm Raging Bull."

","Both the masterpiece of lead Robert de Niro and director Martin Scorsese, Raging Bull is a picture that thoroughly deserves its place in the pantheon of great films. Documenting the rise and fall of boxer Jake La Motta (De Niro) from the early 40's through till the early 60's, Scorsese has crafted visual poetry that at once presents an unflinching, brutal look at the sport and a compelling, intense character study of a man who was disliked by almost everybody.<br/><br/>Jake La Motta is shown in Raging Bull as exactly that  a foul, ugly, violent man who shows no respect for any of his opponents in the ring, and certainly very little for himself. When he marries the beautiful Vicki (Cathy Moriarty), whose surname we never learn, it's not long before Jake begins doubting her faithfulness. It starts at just a mention by Vicki that an upcoming opponent of his is young and good looking (La Motta opts to deal with his opponent's looks by brutally dismantling his face in the ring), and develops rapidly into an all-consuming jealousy and bottled up anger that erupts into a violent fury and rage. Jake's suspects are at first local mob members Salvy and Tommy, but he soon trusts no one, even accusing his own brother, Joey (Joe Pesci), of having an affair with his wife. Jake's frustrations manifest themselves in the ring, the only place he can express his emotions  when he's angry, he'll destroy the poor soul who comes up against him, but when in a state of depression, he'll allow himself to be beaten to a pulp as the only way he knows how to punish himself.<br/><br/>Much has already been said about De Niro's performance in Raging Bull, and I'll add no more here, except to state that it's certainly the best of his distinguished career and resonates with so much brutality, intensity, and eventual tragedy that it will surely go down as one of modern cinema's great achievements. Supporting turns by Pesci and Moriarty are equally impressive, Pesci's Joey exhibiting intelligence and the same capacity for violent outburst as Jake, albeit in a more composed manner, and Moriarty's Vicki in all her quiet and understated seductiveness.<br/><br/>Raging Bull is shot is sobering black-and-white, bar a montage of home video footage midway through the film. It's a stylistic choice that speaks of the brutality of violence in and out of the ring, and it's violence that Scorsese has no hesitation in showing in all honesty. Too often these days, biopics celebrate the achievements and milestones that the precedent reached, but Scorsese takes a different approach - the fights are often very short montages of video clips and still photos, always emphasizing the fact that the focal point of the picture is the study of the character, not the study of his accomplishments. In doing so, Martin Scorsese has created a unique biographical drama where behaviour becomes more fascinating than any plot, and that's entertainment. That's entertainment."

","Robert De Niro pitched the idea of this film based on the book by Jake La Motta and Joseph Carter to director Martin Scorsesse in 1974. It's the biography of Middlewieght boxer Jake La Motta and his climb and fall from fight fame spanning the years 1941-1964. De Niro put on 60 pounds in his transformation of the younger to older La Motta. This film is shot entirely in black and white by cinematographer Michael Chapman who was nominated for and should have won the Academy Award for Cinematography for 1980. From 1939 through 1966 the cinematography category was split into two awards, one for color and one for black and white. From 1967 until present the two categories were reduced to just one regardless of a film in color or black and white. Raging Bull would be the last black and white film to be nominated for Best Cinematography until 2005 when Good Night and Good Luck, shot in black and white received a nomination. Chapman had worked with Scorsesse on Taxi Driver and The Last Waltz. Di Nero won his second career Oscar and his fourth nomination in his portrayal as the self destructive demon battling and brutal Jake La Motta who in the ring masters his rage into an art form. In the supporting cast Cathy Morriarty received her only career nomination as Best Supporting Actress in her role as Vickie La Motta and Joe Pesci as Jake's brother Joey received his first career nomination as Best Supporting Actor. Also in the principal cast are Frank Vincent, Theresa Saldana and Nicholas Colasanto. The film's second Oscar win went to Theresa Schoonmaker who previously had been nominated for her editing of Woodstock. This film was also nominated for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Sound. Raging Bull marked Di Nero's fourth film with Scorsesse following Taxi Driver, Mean Streets and New York, New York. This film has a great script, a wonderful cast from top to bottom, amazing cinematography, sound and editing and a fantastic production design. Some call this Scorsesse's masterpiece but it certainly is Di Nero's masterpiece in acting. I first saw this during it's initial theatrical release and have seen it several times since. I would give this a 10 out of 10."

","Joe Pesci and Robert DeNiro star in one of the most visceral portrayals of one man's fatal flaw (or is it FLAWS?): Jealously, Rage, maybe love seeking to emerge from the ruins of the pugilists wrecked relationships.<br/><br/>This is the story of Jake Lamotta, told from the perspective of the abused spouse - from glory tempered with self-abuse; the rise, and the decline of a man who struggles with existence, who cannot accept himself as human - In the ring he is a killer, and outside, he emulates person-hood, but achieves mere explosive presence.<br/><br/>This is tragedy, this is a story that embodies the fear of many men, who ask the sky, or quiz any convenient divinity: Who am I? Who am I but a derelict, a monster who consumes sustenance and sex. There is no higher ground for which to strive - the immediacy of jejune existence is the mundane pursuit of the neighborhood beauty, an exquisite blonde who is passive to LaMotta's rages, and is tolerant beyond the virtues of a Saint.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most poignant scene in this masterful, razor-sharp film is when LaMotta tries to sell the rubies off his title belt to a pawn broker. The jewels are worthless, LaMotta is worthless - his past glory propels him to oblivious indignities.<br/><br/>I submit that LaMotta's demise, is the demise that men fear as a collective - the uselessness - the loss of hope for future glory. When we examine our character - and Jake never does - when we see nothing but the shell of frustrated desire. Jake's demise is the demise of manhood, the disgust for the world - we missed the boat - and we rage like caged bulls.<br/><br/>The best film of the 1980s. Brilliant. Should have won Oscars galore - but America wasn't ready for this kind of examination of the male psyche (I believe a musical won this year?)."

","Move over, Rocky. 'Raging Bull' is the ultimate boxing film. This film, released in 1980, was shot in black and white. This film is a portrayal of a boxer and his failing relationship with his wife and his determination to succeed. The starkness of the contrast of the black and white picture makes the film seem harder, and the camera shots and angles of the fight are captured perfectly and flawlessly. This is heightened even more with the stark contrast in colour and helps show the darkness of the blood. There are also good performances by the actors and actresses, and the story is an interesting one where one can feel for the characters. This is iconic and brilliantly created, and I recommend this film to anyone, even if boxing is not really something you enjoy. Do not give this one a miss."

","Not only is Raging Bull a great boxing film, the black-and-white film is the icing on the cake. A great true story the relates to many gladiators of today. This film displays the life of Jake LaMotta and his downfalls while on the top of the boxing world. Sadly this is a common demise among many boxers that have & have not reached the pinnacle of the boxing world. All to realistic is the outside lives of a professional boxer, coming from a home of major dysfunction. Not only does Jake have to endure this; but Jake has to endure this while on his way to the top, but while he is at the top. The realism of this movie to display this unexpected ending. After a high point throughout the film ""what goes up must come down"" and so it does. When thinking of this I would finalize it by saying ""Jake, you should have gotten out while you were on top"". <br/><br/>DeNiro and Pesci shows their acting skills that is a sample of what's to come. If you enjoy the wonderful display of acting by this dream cast duo, I would recommend watching ""Goodfellas"" and ""Casino"". Truly a great film!!"

","First of all, I'm a huge fan of De Niro and Scorsese. Especially De Niro, but I think the movies with De Niro becomes much better when Scorsese is directing it. Now to the point. When i first saw this movie I didn't think it was something special, but the second time. I really learnt to love it, This movie is so much more than just a boxing movie, its about in a short sentence, Jake LaMotta's life. De Niro potraited and acted Jake LaMotta so good that I got breathless. This movie don't have any flaws. Completely flawless, the directing is so beautiful done and the acting from Cathie Moriarty and especially Joe Pesci is great. This is Joe Pesci's at his best. And De Niro too. 4years earlier De Niro was staring in my favourite movie Taxidriver(best movie of all time) And that roll I think is a little bit better. Now back to Raging bull, The scene with De Niro when he is fighting with Joey(pesci) that acting is so beautifully done. The silence in the room, and the creepy feeling that something have got wrong is so fun to see.Why does this movie so good? Because you can watch it over and over again and still find things you never have seen before. And you don't see that a lot in movies, It's very rare. I really hope Bobby will do another movie with Scorsese. Because they are brilliant. Best boxing movie of all time without a doubt. I don't think it will come a better boxing movie for real.<br/><br/>20 out of 10stars."
"TheFilmConnoisseur","10","1","2","24 July 2005"," ""I could have been a somebody.""
","The best boxing films are not about boxing. Raging Bull is no exception. Aside from it being a great bio-pic of boxer Jake LaMotta it is also a great story about the fall of a man. The rule of gravity is that whatever goes up must go down. This rule applies to life as well. No one knows that better than LaMotta. He went from a great boxer to an ex-convicted comedian. Life throws a lot of surprises...doesn't it? That is why this is such a great film. We can all relate to LaMotta. We have all had our ups and downs. Then again, just cause something goes down doesn't mean it can't go up again. That's what LaMotta experienced with the making of this movie.<br/><br/>The film features great performances by Robert De Niro (who won an Oscar for this film) and Joe Pesci. Among some other countless performers. The cinematography by Michael Chapman is amazing and the editing by Thelma Schoonmaker is amazing as well.<br/><br/>RATING: 4 STARS (****)"
"DorseyTV","10","1","2","14 May 2005"," Incredible Editing
","When I first saw ""Raging Bull"", I had been video editing for about 8 years for WGBH-TV in Boston. Raging Bull not only validated every belief I ever had of what editing should be, but it also opened a ""new door"" for me. It showed me that a good edit pulls you in - not only to the story but makes you part of it. You live in the film and you're that ""fly on the wall,"" taking in all the facts and the nuances. I think one of the greatest actors with nuances has got to be Dinero - I just watch his face and then it's like you know what he's thinking - he's so good! What I learned from this film is to slow down, allow people to really look at what you're trying to show them - Dinero's subtle gestures are not lost in the edit. Don't overpower the viewer with fast cuts or explosive music - sometimes the natural sounds, like the pounding a heartbeat or the raspy breathing as a fighters pulls on ""everything he's got,"" are the most effective. Everything about Raging Bull is so great - the story, the writing, the direction, the camera, but the editing - the editing is inspiring - she allows us to really see what's going on and to hear it. The editor is such an incredible talent!!!"

"RayCharlie","Null","1","2","16 March 2004"," Scorsese's Finest Hour
","Raging Bull is a biographical movie about the life of middleweight boxing champion, Jake La Motta (Robert DeNiro).  It covers his rise to fame in the early 1940's as a physically tough fighter who held a rivalry with Sugar Ray Robinson, to the middle 40's where he became a champion, and his later days of being a retired boxer club owner.  But the movie is not just about him being a boxer. It shows his downward spiral of life as fame, jealously, and resentment took over. The movie begins with a fight between La Motta and Sugar Ray Robinson. After fighting each other for ten intense rounds, the judges must chose their pick, and they vote Robinson being the winner.  Naturally, this ticks La Motta off and he goes off into his own world of oblivion, taking out most of his anger on his wife.  Jake's brother and manager is Joey La Motta (Joe Pesci), a foul-mouthed little guy who has mob connections.  The mob really likes Jake and bet on him, make money, and of course, try to help him in his rise to fame. The only problem is, Jake hates them.  He doesn't respect them.  And he even shows a loss of respect for his younger brother who hangs around with them.   Jake's life begins to turn around when he meets the beautiful Vickie (Cathy Moriarty), a young girl who hangs out with the whole mob crew.  Jake finally gets the courage to meet with her, and they instantly fall in love.  The movie skips a few months and Jake and Vickie are married, and Jake's boxing career is starting to unfold in a good way.  He fights Sugar Ray Robinson again, but this time he wins.  The public is starting to recognize Jake.  As his boxing career starts to get better, his personal life is getting worse. He becomes extremely jealous about his wife, and at the same time, angry about the mob who now wants him to take a fall in his next match. <br/><br/>The movie is filmed in a beautiful black and white and the only color scenes are when Jake and his family are on vacation, which I found the color to be totally out of context.  The soundtrack is great filled with an Italian score. Robert DeNiro once again proves he is an excellent actor.  He even put on some weight for the later part of the movie.  This film also showcased the talent of Joe Pesci, who was a struggling actor at the time and was about to retire from the film business.  Raging Bull showed his immense talent and now is one of today's most recognized actors. As far as directing goes, I really can't say I've ever been disappointed with Martin Scorsese.  Of all of his movies I've seen, I've enjoyed every one.  Raging Bull is no exception.  It's at some parts sad, exciting, comical, brutal, and most of all: real.  The movie doesn't hold anything back, as far as language and violence goes.  The hits to the face in the boxing matches look real as can be, as well as the blood, which was chocolate syrup, so it would appear better in black and white. <br/><br/>In conclusion, Raging Bull is one of those pictures that I can't believe I haven't seen already.  Some parts were dragged out and boring, but notice I said `some'.  The movie isn't a mystery or doesn't keep you guessing.  It just flat out tells you how Jake La Motta was and doesn't hold anything back.  Considered a classic in modern cinema, this one is defiantly going in my DVD collection as soon as a Special Edition is released."

","It takes an actor, only the rank of Robert De Niro, to perfectly play the role of a violent, mercurial guy, who has no clue whatsoever of what he has to do with his life. Moreover, only an actor like De Niro can play the part of a well toned, energetic boxer, and also fatten himself up at the same time, to play the role of the same well toned energetic pugilist when all he cares about is glutting himself up and being slothful to the point of being indifferent. All the more, it takes a director, the caliber of Scorsese to make De Niro do all of these things.<br/><br/>Scorsese is a master of disturbing movies. His movies are subtle, yet disturbing. In `Raging Bull', he has perfectly captured the deranged character of Jack La Motta, and has chosen the perfect person to enact this character. The movie is uncomplicated, but the fights are not. Each moment of La Motta's various fights seems to be crafted diligently and with perfection. The fights are violent, but not gory. But, the blood-spills of the fights, even in black-and-white seem quite distressing. Of course, De Niro acts fantastically, even, and especially during his boxing scenes.<br/><br/>The black-and-white look of the movie, enhancing the subfusc nature of it, actually helps one, focus fully on the intensity of the characters, especially since everything else around them seem so livid and wan. As a matter of fact, colors are used symbolically by the artful Scorsese. The majority of the movie is pretty depressing. Hence, the movie is colorless, for the major part of it. However, the movie has a five-odd minute patch, which is shot in color. In fact, the colored' part, is the only positive part of the movie, which actually is a phantasmagoria of shots, showing positive things happening to lives of the Motta brothers.<br/><br/>
`Raging Bull' is quite a depressing movie; there is no doubt about that. But, it is one of those movies, which is ought to be studied' for its brilliant direction (especially the non-usage of color producing greater effect) and the acting, especially of Robert De Niro, who did seem to actually put a on lot of weight for the movie.         <br/><br/>

Martin Scorsese's direction takes us through his life, his ups, his downs, and his fight to continue on.<br/><br/>First of all, this movie has is not a feel-good movie. It's silence and story is sometimes terrorizing, not to mention the fighting scenes, which are not brought in there for box-office performance. The fabulous black-and-white boxing matches are filmed with such an elegance that you are hardly able to glimpse. It's that well-done.<br/><br/>Before this movie, I thought boxing was very stupid (as a matter of fact), but this movie makes the ""danse macabre"" an art. It's almost beauty. To see the beauty in violence, only then do you truly know motion picture art. Which is why this movie tells us exactly why Martin Scorsese is the greatest living director. Not only are you anstounded by the way this movie looks, but the whole atmosphere, the feeling of being with him, feeling with Jake is so fantastic.<br/><br/>The acting done by Robert DeNiro is not only his best work, but perhaps the best in cinema history. The character of Jake has so many sides to convince the audience about, and this is exactly what Bob  does. Also, his performance is one of the prime examples of method acting. Before the movie, DeNiro had boxed over a 1000 rounds of boxing with the actual Jake La Motta, and he had lost about 30 pounds. Then, to get into Jake La Motta's life after boxing, he put on another 60. If that's not dedication, then what is it?<br/><br/>It's actually unbelievable how low this movie is on the top 250, as I, and lots of others would reckon this as the truly greatest motion picture of all time. It's hard to tell why, but the movie is so emotional, so beautiful, and Martin Scorsese has without a doubt with this movie shown exactly how talented he is. Don't hesitate.

That does get a little hard to watch on ocassion. Maybe the over-brutal and in fact over-exciting boxing scenes. We all know that middleweights do not throw so many rapid-fire punches round after round after round - they tend to hang to each other rather a lot after a few rounds and duck a lot of what's thrown at them. Here, La Motta, Suger Ray and the like all punch like rivetting guns and never miss, never duck and seldom take a breather. It's fantasy boxing, however well shot and however impressive it looks. It's like auto racing footage that used to be shown speeded up in Hollywood movies of yore. It always looks fake. Other than that, and the fact this is a grim tale with few redeeming moments of levity, it's a masterpiece in movie making. De Niro was surely seldom better and Pesci is like a firework display in full cry. Two scenes stand out above all others. One is the wonderful title sequence of the hooded La Motta warming up in the ring, in slow motion to a most beautiful piece of music (I can never remember it's title but it's heartbreakingly good!) with the background shrouded in smoke and floodlighting.Poetry. The other is a long single shot taking La Motta from the dressing room out through the corridors, into the auditorium and up into the ring with the quiet and reflection of back-stage suddenly errupting into a mad frenzy of cheering and popping flash guns. Terrific.<br/><br/>All in all it's a hard film to actually enjoy but it's one that deserves all of it's endless admiration."

While the Lord of the Ring movies may be very good films, they do not even come close to touching the grace, violence, or emotion that Robert De Niro and Martin Scorcese bring to the screen in Raging Bull. The boxing scenes are some of the finest film work ever done. Robert De Niro delivers the best performance of his career so far, and in doing so, gives the greatest acting performance I've ever seen. De Niro is unbelieveably raw and emotional. His portrayal of LaMotta fills the screen. Cathy Moriarty is very good in her role as is Joe Pesci.

"SanTropez_Couch","10","1","2","8 March 2003"," The Himalayan highpoint of Scorsese and De Niro
","I've experienced a lot of things watching Martin Scorsese's movies, but I've never been moved. Granted I haven't seen his ""woman picture"" (""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"") or his period piece (""The Age of Innocence""), and the ones I have seen -- maybe with the exception of ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" -- don't deal with feelings as much as they do with repressed and let-loose emotions. This is the first time I finished watching one of his movies and sat for a second thinking about the story, the characters and my own feelings, as well as Scorsese's virtuoso filmmaking technique.<br/><br/>It's not a sports movie or a movie about boxing. It's actually more akin to an intense family drama than it would be to ""Rocky."" Scorsese is most interested in his characters. I'm not taking away from the superbly composed boxing scenes -- in fact, it's a testament to the greatness of the film that something in the film could actually top them (I don't think I'll ever forget the spit, sweat, water and blood spraying off the boxers' faces). The editing of these scenes, and the entire film, is significant.<br/><br/>Scorsese shows us the private lives of the characters. Jake La Motta (Robert De Niro) yelling at his wife for overcooking a steak; Jake meeting his future wife (Cathy Moriarty) at an outdoor swimming pool and offering to take her for a ride (he wastes no time with her, either). Scorsese skims over details of Jake's career and shows many fights in montage or stills. What he's interested in is Jake's home life, which is a bigger battleground than inside the ring. The fully fleshed-out scenes that show Jake's ever-increasing paranoia about the loyalty of his wife, and ultimately of his brother Joey (Joe Pesci). The simple mentioning by Jake's wife that one of his opponents is an attractive, popular fighter is enough to set things in motion in Jake's mind. That Joey would include himself when he mentions others on Jake's bad side, fed up with his obsessive mistrust, is sufficient reason for Jake to explode into violence. <br/><br/>It's hard to talk about the individual scenes because so many of them are perfect. It's an extremely rare occasion where you wouldn't want to touch up any of these quieter moments, and this is one.<br/><br/>It's interesting to note (or maybe it isn't) that of the five Best Picture nominees at the Oscars that year, two were in black and white (this film is completely, not including less than a handful of home video footage). And both of those films are much better remembered masterpieces, from two of the most distinctive auteurs of the second half of the twentieth century, than the film that won. And as long as we're on Oscars, Joe Pesci probably deserved another for his work here. Heck, Moriarty earned one, too.<br/><br/>Pauline Kael was right when she said De Niro was never the same after this. Up to 1980, he was a lean, mean ferociously talented acting machine. After this film, no matter how hard he may have tried or in what role he was in, he seemed lazy. He was still good -- one of the most brilliantly physical actors on a so-so day is still better than a mediocre actor with no physical presence -- but he was never again what he was up until ""Raging Bull."" And I'd be hard pressed to think of another ""final"" performance to showcase an actor's full talent. <br/><br/>In Jake La Motta, De Niro found his signature character (even if Travis Bickle gets more name recognition). Like many of his films, Scorsese here frames the film with an opening taken from a little past the midpoint of the film, and with the closing, we get the treat of seeing De Niro playing La Motta playing Brando playing Malloy. <br/><br/>This is my favorite Scorsese film, probably his best, an undeniable masterwork, and to top it off, the gorgeous black and white will seal it forever.<br/><br/>****"

The performances are electric - this is DeNiro at his best (if you loved him in Taxi Driver, you've got to see him in this)- and Cathy Moriarity gives a truly dynamic break-out performance.

","Raging Bull will always go down as a cinematic classic not so much in my opinion for the film itself but for one of the most amazing acting performances ever seen.De Niro goes from a very fit healthy man to a very fat overweight loser. I doubt an actor has ever gone through so much for a film and this film just shows why the man is the most respected actor in Hollywood. As for the film , im not sure it actually is as good as i could have been but it's great to see Joe Pesci teaming up with Robert De Niro again  .<br/><br/>According to the credits at the start of the Film Jake Le Motta actually had a say in the film and if that is so he is a very brave man because he comes across as a nasty piece of work that deserved every thing that came to him. I also think the boxing scenes are very poorly filmed, they are way over the top and as any boxing fan will tell you , boxing matches are nothing like what we see in the film. I would love to have seen this film made on colour because im not sure that the black and white worked as well as they would have liked but i'm sure most people will disagree with that. 8 out of 10."

","The most renowned film of the Scorsese/De Niro partnership, Raging Bull is an insight into a highly disturbed man's life, superbly played by De Niro [as usual].<br/><br/>His growing paranoia and jealousy, particularly where his wife Vickie is concerned, helps build a man who you should have pity for by the end of the film, but you just can't bring yourself to have that pity.<br/><br/>De Niro's talent as a character actor shines through, and you do believe that he is a boxer as he is incredibly convincing as Jake La Motta.<br/><br/>The black and white cinematography and camera work gives Raging Bull the feeling of a documentary well, and it fits perfectly as a classic Scorsese film.<br/><br/>Some of the supporting cast did well, others gave a predictable performance [particularly Joe Pesci], although perhaps this is inevitable given that the same Italian Americans seem to appear in every film set in this community."
"leybman","10","1","2","21 November 2000"," Cinematically Speaking One of the Best Films of All Time
","This is maybe one of the greatest films ever made from Cinematic point of view, meaning that it uses many new techniques involving editing that were never tried before. This is also maybe one of the best character studies of any one character in cinema history. SPOILER ALERT The story tells the story of a boxer, named Jake La Motta and whose brother, Joey, played incredibly well by Joe Pesci. Soon Jake falls for Vickie, a very attractive girl and they fall in love, which in my opinion was a different kind of love for both of them. Jake was looking for someone to take care of him, but Vickie was looking for man to satisfy her need for a father figure. From there the story progresses and it shows in the most eleoquen detail the fall of a great boxer. In it it involves the mafia and its gambling, it involves love and the fall of a once-great figure in boxing, it involes portraying life in a manner of luck having to do a lot with what happens with, and the detruction of a man caught by his own paranoia of thinking his wife is cheating on him.<br/><br/>This is maybe on the best movies of the 1980s and maybe even of all time in terms of eloquent study of the character and his downfall. The acting by De Niro and Pesci as two brothers was incredible. You could almost feel the two actually being brothers in real life. The scene where Joey comes in and is instigated by his brother to hit him on the face was incredible in that you could actually feel two little boys pestering each other. It was kind of odd in a certain way, but it reminded me of two brothers who haven't grown up.<br/><br/>This is also in some ways a very touching stories in use of images and dialogue. The characters seem very real. Martin Scorsece was also very wise to show at the beginning of the film a very fat Jake La Motta in 1961 and then immediately switching to 1941 so as to make the audience prepare for what was to happen later so that they could keep an eye out for the touching things and events that would later prove the downfall of this boxer.<br/><br/>This movie also contains some of the most gruesome scenes involving boxing that I have ever seen. The scenes and the close-ups of punches on boxer's faces were so grotesque and yet so realistic that you can't take your eyes of the screen. For these scenes, did it win the editing award in 1980s Oscars.<br/><br/>This is maybe the greatest acting performance done by De Niro to date, and probably will not be topped later. De Niro had to play a realistic character with features that would make him interesting and yet sadly unlikeable. The audience almost feel that they should like him but they really can't in no way.<br/><br/>My favorite scene was the close up of the blood stained rope as the winner was announced in a fight that Jake was in. The shot was incredible in that made the audience not actually see something and by doing that added the effect of sadness and loss that we feel for the winner. Another favorite scene was of De Niro saying to the character of Sugar Ray Robinson in his most witty way ""You didn't get me down"" which really symbolized the life of Jake, being that it doesn't matter how much you suffer, just as long as you win in the wrong run.<br/><br/>This is a sad story and I haven't even scratched the surface while telling yout the plot. A lot more happens later, with the Chracter gaining on 50 pounds and finally snapping and beating up his brother for his suspicion of sleeping with his wife.<br/><br/>The story ends on a somber note with Jake kicking his head against the prison walls screaming... ""Why? Why? Why?""<br/><br/>This is a movie that is strong and thoughtful. This is not a movie for popcorn or entertainment value. This is an indepth study of a character and his life. It's sad and not gentle. It's gruesome and not tidy. This is an incredible movie but only if watched for the right reasons."

","Generally, I'm not a Scorsese fan because his movies are always heavy, serious and long and I'm used to the opposite movies. However, Raging Bull was very impressive.  I particularly liked the opening shadow boxing sequence.  It was beautiful.  The greatest thing about this movie is, it's about a boxer but it's totally different from Rocky.  It's about a famous boxer who have a attitude problem's curved life: how he loses his fame and his family and friends. De Niro gives a excellent performance as usual."
"Ali Hirji","10","1","2","25 July 2000"," Brutally Honest
","It would be horribly wrong to think of Martin Scorsese's ""Raging Bull"" as a no-holds-barred testament to the world of professional boxing or a simple, if effective, biography of middleweight champ Jake La Motta. One would also be mistaken in seeing it as an exploration of the rise and fall of a once prominent sports hero. Bull's focus is not on plot, or even singularly on character. Rather, it is about the stunning interplay between the soul and its outmost needs, and the ever present contrast between the physical, and the emotional and spiritual.<br/><br/>Scorsese's brilliance in realizing the film is matched by his immensely talented creative team. Paul Schrader's script is strikingly intelligent, as he finds a perfect balance in playing out La Motta's innermost psychological demons with an onslaught of brutality. Michael Chapman's gritty, black and white cinematography (he also shot ""Taxi Driver"") gives an evocative and at times shocking glimpse into the psyche of a truly conflicted man. Scorsese, despite some truly superb stylistic work- note how he compresses and then elongates the size of the ring for momental effect- never loses sight of his themes of low self esteem, jealous insecurity, and fear. He masterfully weaves them into a kind of poetry, as the scenes between La Motta and his wife in their domestic rage, and those within the ring take on a kind of rhythym. It is this rhythm that allows Scorsese to perfectly strike every dramatic note dead on.<br/><br/>If it is Scorsese who provides the film with its basic structure, it is the actors who give it its soul. Robert De Niro, in what has to be one of the ten finest performances of all time in American film, gives us a raw and painstakingly honest central performance. De Niro's work is so pure, and so emotionally raw, that he breaks the barrier between character and audience. We become embroiled fully in the film's hurricane,as its force confounds our expectations. The supporting work is also superb. Joe Pesci, playing La Motta's long suffering brother,captures all the right notes as a man torn between his own ragen and inhumanity, and his need to protect Jake from himself. And Cathy Moriarty, as La Motta's wife, Vicki, is stunning, conveying her character to us with cool-eyed intelligence.<br/><br/>""Raging Bull"" is an immensely ambitious film. It gives us a rare glimpse into our humanity, confronting head-on some of our most terrifying inner workings. Like any successful film made from a biography, the film becomes so much more than a mere retelling of its character's life. It becomes a thematic exploration- its issues as relevant to La Motta's life as they are to ours."
"A-Ron-2","8","1","2","5 July 2000"," Probably the greatest boxing film ever made
","Every time I watch Raging Bull I am more surprised than I was before.  This film is beautifully filmed, acted, directed and written.  Perhaps the pace is kind of slow, but it is a slow kind of movie, and LaMotta was a slow kind of guy.  These people aren't brainsurgeons, they don't speak well (unless rehearsed, which I think might have been a jab at On The Waterfront).<br/><br/>This film is simply a joy to watch (well, if you are in the mood, I can easily see this film NOT being fun to watch at, say, a party).<br/><br/>Anyway, the rise and fall of Jake LaMotta is not a grand tale, there is very little moral proseletyzing in this film (as there is in many boxing films). The characters are just who they are, warts and all, which is Scorcese's specialty.  This is not his greatest film, but it is a pretty damn fine movie anyway.<br/><br/>I would say more, but I think that most of it has been said."

","Raging Bull often turns up at the top of critic's polls as one of the best films of the 80s (and sometimes of all time). Often there is a reference to how it is a vastly superior film to Redford's Ordinary People - which took home the Best Picture Oscar in 1980.  In my view, this is overstated. While Scorsese's virtuoso technique in Raging Bull is up there at the top of cinematic achievement, both the themes explored in the film and LaMotta's life story are not that compelling.  It seems to me that Redford's film is penalized for its deliberate pace and seemingly conventional shot selection. It would have been absurd for him to shoot the film in any other fashion. I feel these two films are of equal effect and value."

But I often find moral failings in Scorsese--this movie just fits his flawed guys thing.<br/><br/>But the most impressive part of the movie is La Motta quoting ""On the Waterfront"" to himself in the mirror.

The splendid camera work, the perfect 1940s New York locations, an unsurpassed cast, splendid editing and of course the inimitable combination of De Niro and Scorsese make for a movie that feels timeless - with most films there is usually a quality that allows one to determine the approximate age.  This is due in no small part to the black-and-white film, although few ignorant of its age would guess this film is now 21 years old.<br/><br/> The fight scenes are magnificent - super-real in detail (the fights are reportedly taken punch-for-punch from the original ones) while LaMotta later commented that after a gruelling training regime De Niro could have quite conceivably turned professional.  Scorsese used differing sizes of boxing rings to illustrate atmosphere and boxing style.  If you ever see the film, take a second to notice.<br/><br/> There are countless memorable moments and endless quotable dialogue, and the everyday scenes counteract the explosive fights.  Joe Pesci turns in a lifetime best performance (in my opinion better than Tommy in GoodFellas and Nicky in Casino), while Cathy Moriarty is excellent as LaMotta's long-suffering wife.<br/><br/> There really is too much to write about.

I will say that Joe Pesci did do some decent work here. He breathes life into his character but De Niro just has the same look on his face as he always does. That blank Taxi Driverish stare. That's what he does when he doesn't know what else to do. Anyway, to summarize this idiotic film, Jake La Motta cheats on his wife with a 15 year old girl, gets paranoid, slaps and punches out his brother and his girlfriend, feels sorry for himself. So what does he do next? He gains some weight and hits on 14 year old girls at a bar. Wow.. what a masterpiece. Have I mentioned the completely ridiculous boxing sequences?

To summarize the movie: a great boxer who is unable to control his temper, fights with everyone including his wife and brother and lead a life of misery. Thats it. There is nothing great in this movie.
 Now lets go through the reasons for high rating of this movie. The first reason is this movie has a great actor and a great director. I agree that the actor and director are great, but does that mean that the movie is great? Cant best people in a field create a mediocre product? The second reason is DeNiro has gained and lost weight for this movie. Now come-on how can an actor gaining a weight for a movie can make the movie great. This has been done by so many people before this and after this. Should not the movie have something that captures the attention of audience? The third reasoni is that, the movie is based on real boxer. Now if the life of boxer is an average life, then there is nothing great in the movie. The fourth reason is some boxing scene. There are lot of movies that have such scenes and this is nothing new. However, the few boxing scenes were reason I rated this movie as 3 star. Another reason is the domestic violence and a fight scene in club for a very silly reason. I don't understand how can this be a reason for making a movie great. There are lots of movie which have violence for silly reasons and we rate such movies as B grade movies.
 There a few good scene in the movie, but thats it. Those few scenes hardly span 10 to 15 minutes of the movie. Similar to this movie I consider ""boyhood"", ""shining"", ""deer Hunter"" to be another examples of overrated movies. I hope my writing will save 2 hours of someone's life."

This is typical Scorsese....over-cooking the violent scenes once again. Its really quite sad----because the film is pretty good. However, people tend to over rate Robert De Niros performance. I think its because he gallantly gained 60lbs. (27 kg) in weight to play the horrible Jake Lamotta (a guy with LOADS of personality defects) in his post boxing career. Putting that weight on was heroic----but forget that and judge his acting. Its nowhere near the heights he reached in Taxi Driver. (Still his finest hour). Martin Scorsese showed great promise in the 1970s--but he has since been disappointing. (Apart from Goodfellas). Scorsese has never made a 10 / 10 movie.

This is the only time Scorsese has perfectly structured a rise and fall story. It has a beginning, middle and end yet leaves parts to the imagination. It doesn't focus too much on one era (Goodfellas in the rise, Casino in the fall), yet it never feels like it cuts anything short. De Niro is simply dynamic. He covers such a range of emotions and hits everything perfectly. The ""You *bleeped* my wife!"" and the jail scenes are two of the best I've ever witnessed. I should also mention that this is the only time I haven't wanted to stab Joe Pesci in the head. He became too full of himself and type-cast in his later years, but in this he is just perfect. Moriarty is also heartbreaking and seductive. The score is flawless. It has a very elegant and nostalgic feel to it, which Scorsese crafted to a tee. The cinematography is some of the best ever, with the scenes flawlessly shot and put together."
"antagonist117","3","3","15","16 March 2014"," Style is the servant of story, so Scorcese's talents cannot compensate for derivative and dull plotting
","Martin Scorcese's adaptation of a boxer's autobiography also contains content adapted (or, less generously, plagiarized) from previous films. The elements of the story that Scorcese emphasizes are the same that were at the core of ""Rocky,"" and it is therefore fair to draw comparisons between the two: an Italian-American boxer who fights an African-American boxer and loses, an overshadowed wife figure, and a short, pudgy brother figure who doubles as a manager. What Scorcese's film does not have is any of the heart and sweetness that made ""Rocky"" enjoyable. Perhaps he hoped to replace the sweetness and light with a more realistic, hardcore sentiment, but he got only as far as the blood and gore and cursing, and forgot to add any meaning. There are no stakes to Jake LaMotta (Robert DeNiro)'s fights, as there were for Rocky's: Jake's life winds up the same regardless of their outcome. It's difficult to find a reason to care whether he wins or loses, unless you're content to root for him because he's the main character. ""Rocky"" knew that wasn't a good enough reason, and fleshed out its characters and world. If there were no elements of LaMotta's book that could have given some originality and depth to the story, Scorcese should have invented some.<br/><br/>Instead of filling in the story's sizable gaps with original content, Scorcese rips off ""The Godfather"" in completely needless, bizarrely particular ways. There are grainy pictures at a wedding party where everyone is wearing the exact clothes from the beginning of Coppola's movie, and one character even reaches over to bring a woman in a red dress and wide-brimmed hat into the shot. Why import this familiar scene, stripping it of the layers of meaning it enjoyed in its original context? It adds nothing to ""Raging Bull,"" not even the reflected luster of the superior film being copied. Later, during one of many interminable and repetitive domestic abuse scenes, a man chases his wife into a bathroom through a narrow, mirrored side-door. The door swings mostly shut, but he throws it open again. Some of the angles are the same as in that famous, far more important and meaningful scene from ""The Godfather."" Why such meticulous thievery? Again, it adds nothing to ""Raging Bull,"" but it does serve to remind me of a movie I'd rather be watching, and it causes me to marvel again at the delicate plotting and characterizations that made it work in its native setting.<br/><br/>Near the end, LaMotta deadpans a scene from ""On the Waterfront."" The audacity. The conceit. Clearly, we're being asked to marvel at how true the words are of LaMotta's life (well, of course they are, the movie has been written that way), but I'm not sure what we're supposed to feel during this scene. Are we supposed to feel sad for this wretched stereotype we've spent over two hours with? Are we supposed to take pleasure in the pathetic turn his life has taken? Never having been given a reason to care about anyone or anything on screen, I feel nothing either way. It's simply a bore to watch. There is one thing to be sad about, and that's that DeNiro's career has become uncomfortably like LaMotta's: he, too, has lately been reduced to lazily reading scripts for cash.<br/><br/>Scorcese fans, and there are many of them who know far more about movies than I do, will say what they will about Sorcese's technical chops as a filmmaker and his fluency in the history and language of cinema. It seems inexplicable to me that so few critics saw the same ""Raging Bull"" that Pauline Kael saw, about which she wrote, ""Scorsese's excesses verge on self-parody. You can feel the director sweating for greatness, but there's nothing under the scenes... De Niro's portrayal of La Motta is a swollen puppet with only bits and pieces of a character inside."" That describes the ""Raging Bull"" I watched. Without a story to put Scorcese's talents in service of, they're wasted. ""Raging Bull"" is preening and shallow, and every element in it was done better before and since by filmmakers who understand the primacy of narrative."

The editing is pure genius, and the occasional use of slow motion and rapid editing work wonderfully. The sound design is shockingly great, and manages to balance being both subtle and noticeable really well. And, of course, the acting is top notch! Robert De Niro's performance as boxer Jake La Motta is threatening, scary, and sympathetic, and he easily deserved the Best Actor Oscar, for it may be his finest performance. The rest of the cast also does an exceptional job, especially Joe Pesci, whose performance is almost equal to De Niro's (but not quite). On top of all this, the boxing sequences are shot fantastically. Scorsese's camera moves and cuts with the speed and smoothness only a masterful filmmaker could pull off!<br/><br/>The film is also a remarkable story, full of ups and downs, and, in the end, it's extraordinarily powerful. There were some moments during the film that had me in more suspense than most horror movies ever will, and the entire story was structured very well. There's no sign of a cliché anywhere, things just happen before your eyes, you really feel like you're watching La Motta's life, and you love it! I wasn't just blown away by this film, I was entertained by it! Its two hours flew by, and when the credits rolled I was left blown away, and very impressed."

De Niro gained 60 pounds to play the role of Jake LaMotta and he won a well deserved Best Actor award for his role. But its the not the weight gain or the fighting scenes that won him that award. He won I believe because of the scenes he showed sadness and sorrow, for example the scene in the locker room after he threw the fight and the scene in the jail cell after he was arrested, these are the two most powerful scenes in the movie and they are the reason he won that award its not an opinion its a fact.

"The Grand Master","7","1","3","10 February 2015"," Excellent performance from Robert De Niro, but the movie was good but not great
","Many critics argue that Raging Bull is one of Robert De Niro's and Martin Scorsese's greatest movies of all time. I slightly disagree. While Raging Bull is a good movie, I don't think it is a masterpiece compared to other Robert De Niro/Martin Scorsese calibrations such as Taxi Driver (1976), Goodfellas (1990) and Casino (1995). It can be unpleasant to watch at times, and the film does a good job portraying Jake LaMotta as an unsympathetic character who's self destructive behaviour costs him his boxing career, his marriage to Vickie LaMotta (Cathy Moriarty), and almost his relationship with his brother Joey LaMotta (Joe Pesci) who is also his manager.<br/><br/>I won't dispute the fact that Robert De Niro's performance as Jake La Motta is one of his best performances that earned him a well deserved Academy Award for Best Actor. Robert De Niro has always been a powerhouse actor, as shown in such movies as The Godfather Part II (1974), Taxi Driver (1976), Awakenings (1990), Goodfellas (1990), Cape Fear (1991), Casino (1995) and Heat (1995). Hats off to Robert De Niro for giving it his all to prepare for the role of Jake LaMotta. Robert De Niro went through extensive physical training in which he went through 1000 rounds of sparring, and jumped into the ring for three genuine boxing matches, winning two and losing one. The real Jake LaMotta was said to be very impressed with Robert De Niro's preparation for the role. Robert De Niro also gained 60 pounds (30 kg) to play the older Jake LaMotta. Joe Pesci is excellent Joey LaMotta, who is Jake's brother and manager, as well as often the voice of reason for Jake. Cathy Moriarty as Jake's abused and tormented wife Vickie LaMotta who is often on the receiving end of Jake's violent temper.<br/><br/>I don't consider Raging Bull to be one of Martin Scorsese's best movies, although I still think that he is a quality director who has directed many excellent movies in his career including Taxi Driver (1976), Goodfellas (1990), Cape Fear (1991), Casino (1995), The Departed (2006), and The Wolf of Wall Street (2013).<br/><br/>If anything I considered Raging Bull to be more of a routine but depressing and bleak boxing movie. Raging Bull is a good movie, but I don't consider it to be a masterpiece, it is definitely worth watching to see Robert De Niro's best performance.<br/><br/>7/10"

Plots involving self-destructive behavior ala Lamotta is a fascinating tragedy and the realism comes through in the movie. What a cast and director.

He quickly falls in love with Vickie, a beautiful young girl, and they marry. Jake's manager and brother, Joe, is with him all along the story. Jake is a stubborn, selfish, and jealous person. He is always questioning his wife's faithfulness to him, even to the point of accusing his brother of sleeping with her. All the while Jake is trying to achieve the title of world champion. These selfish feelings are eventually what brings his downfall.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro gives another great performance. He's so believable as the paranoid Jake La Mota.

That's definitely not the case with Raging Bull. I heard some great stories on how Scorsese filmed the boxing scenes, apparently they literally took days to shoot just 1 scene, because in those days, filming POV from the opponent was never seen before ( or so they say ; )<br/><br/>Also, it's just a great film, with a great de Niro!!"
"sme_no_densetsu","8","1","3","22 June 2009"," A classic and that's no bull
","Martin Scorsese's ""Raging Bull"" is a classic of American cinema, and rightly so. In 2008, an AFI poll placed the film at the top of all American sports films but it's really much more than that. It's an artfully executed character study of a paranoid, destructive man who just happens to be a great boxer.<br/><br/>In portraying Jake La Motta, Robert De Niro won his second Oscar and it's easy to see why. He famously put on sixty pounds to play the boxer in his retirement years but his performance needs no such gimmickry in order to succeed. He effortlessly handles all aspects of the role, from raging bull to pitiful has-been. The rest of the cast gives him capable support. In fact, Joe Pesci & Cathy Moriarty both landed Oscar nominations.<br/><br/>The direction by Scorsese is near flawless (I say near flawless because some of the fisticuffs aren't totally convincing as far as I'm concerned). While Scorsese didn't get the Oscar that he deserved, Thelma Schoonmaker's editing did. It should also be noted that the cinematography landed an Oscar nomination as well. Also worth noting is the soundtrack, which mostly sticks in the background but also makes superb use of the intermezzo from Pietro Mascagni's ""Cavalleria Rusticana"".<br/><br/>Ultimately, though, I do think that the film has a bit of a weak link and that's the story. Perhaps it's La Motta's lack of redeeming features but, to me, his journey seems somewhat inconsequential. That being said, it's not a bad story; it's just not at quite the same level as the other elements of the film.<br/><br/>All in all, this is indeed a worthy classic but I don't completely agree with the critical consensus that typically identifies it as one of the very best of all time (I'm thinking top 10 or so here). However, all that really boils down to is that I think it's slightly less of a masterpiece than other masterpieces."

","Marty has always been a director whose films involved the evolution or down fall of a man, whether it be Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver, Jesus in The Last Temptation Of Christ or Billy Costigan in The Departed. All of these films and characters have one common theme and that is the character and essence of humanity. Cinematically Raging Bull is a brilliant film that works in all the right ways and pushes all the right emotional buttons. Robert Deniro as always was phenomenal and I also have to give props to Joe Pesci who actually plays a likable character in this one. The movie is in Black and White and that gives it a very gritty almost Noir feel which I think fits perfectly. Anyway give the film a watch and you will not only be entertained you will be moved."

","You can't fault the quality of Raging Bull. As a work of art, its stunning. The editing, not just of the fight scenes, but of the whole movie, is some of the best I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Watching this movie, you can't doubt that its a success. You always feel as though the film knows where it wants to go and is headed there. Whether you want to go there as well is another question. There isn't anything really pleasant about Raging Bull. Its lyrical, but only in its use of the beauty of sheer force and blind power.<br/><br/>I think the move could still be interesting just on the sensational amount of frustrated rage and energy that De Niro brings to it, and his absolutely flawless and slightly scary performance, but Pesci and Moriarty are every bit as good. <br/><br/>Again, you can't really say that Raging Bull is anything but a beautifully executed movie. But its hard to love its characters, however deeply you understand them."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","1","3","3 August 2008"," More than a great sports movie, if you can even call it that
","""Raging Bull"" is sort of a sports drama by association. The way that director Martin Scorsese strings together the story of famous boxer Jake La Motta, the film is more of the rise and fall of a man who made his life as a boxer. It's amazing how few minutes of the film are boxing scenes and yet those scenes stick with you enough that you're convinced you're watching a sports movie. Instead, it's a biopic and arguably the first great biopic of a sports figure.<br/><br/>La Motta is played by Robert De Niro in what one would argue is either his first or second greatest collaboration with longtime friend and film partner Scorsese. I would say first, because the dedication that De Niro gives to this role is so apparent from start to finish. The sparse boxing is incredible and the amount of weight lost and gained seems almost unprecedented for one film. Not only that, but De Niro seems to capture all sides of La Motta's personality whether a ladies man or an emotionally insecure, angry husband. <br/><br/>The truth is that there's not that much going on in this film. It's a movie based around one man's life, which means the actor playing the man has to be really good and his story needs to be well told. Scorsese and De Niro hit it on the nose here. If anything, you walk away from this film seeing how a man who seemed to have so much success as a boxer really never had what truly mattered most to him in his personal life because he was so focused on his pride. While I could have used a bit more going on, Scorsese makes a lot of moments draw you in. The curious affair of La Motta and Vicki (Moriarty) is really well shot and both actors are so interesting to watch together, making it all the harder to deal with as they fight more in the latter half of the film. I also couldn't write a review without properly mentioning the strong supporting acting from Joe Pesci as Joey La Motta, Jake's brother. They also have great chemistry in the film.<br/><br/>So you could say ""Raging Bull"" is about boxing, but it's really about how boxing for one particular boxer shaped and affected his life in positive and ultimately demising ways. I'm too cautious to call this a sports drama, but boxing does play an integral role in the movie without question. It simply goes to show the deeper human stories behind some of the world's greatest athletes and how it's not simply all about hard work and overcoming the odds. There are more themes in the world of sports than just that. It doesn't have to come down to who is going to triumph in the end. In ""Raging Bull,"" you couldn't care less if he wins or loses, you just want to see how it will affect the rest of his life."

","Frank McCourt claims that no one in America admits that they drink Pabst. I don't know that that's true, but it does seem to have been relegated to what we called ""frat beer"" when I was in college. In 1941, however, when Raging Bull takes place, it seems to have been a much bigger brand, at least that's the impression I get when seeing it as a major sponsor at major sporting events. Robert DeNiro stars as the enormously insecure Jake LaMotta, a young boxing legend who has trouble separating his boxing life with his private life. <br/><br/>Raging Bull walks a fine line between being a boxing movie and a social drama, as we switch back and forth between LaMotta's turbulent boxing career and his steadily disintegrating personal life. The boxing scenes are magnificent even though Scorsese didn't pick up on Hitchcock's infamous chocolate syrup prop, giving us huge amounts of blood (in typical Scorsese style) that looks like water (not typical Scorsese style). He also makes great use of super slow motion flashbulbs, which seems to be one of his recurring motifs. <br/><br/>More than anything else, the movie is a fascinating portrayal of what fame can do to someone who doesn't deserve it, or can't handle it. At the beginning of the movie, Jake is a young boxing hero and we want to root for him. Then as the movie progresses he reveals his true self  unpredictable, alcoholic, spontaneously violent, and generally just the kind of guy that no one in their right mind would want to be associated with. Even his own brother (in a brilliant performance by Joe Pesci) is uncomfortable around him because he's always doing some bizarre thing, like demanding that he punch him in the face repeatedly. <br/><br/>Through his own uncontrollable outbursts and inability to maintain his composure, his boxing career disintegrates, leaving him a burned out has-been with no idea how to handle the money he has left over. He opens a nightclub (can you guess what he called it?) and becomes a total dirtbag. All the stops have been pulled out by now, he no longer cares about anything, even the law, and he begins making stupid mistakes. He allows a 14-year-old girl to drink in his club because she's a good kisser, and ultimately lands himself in solitary. What's a 14-year-old girl doing in a nightclub anyway?<br/><br/>LaMotta's problems all seem to stem from his sense of invincibility. He doesn't believe anyone can beat him in the ring and taunts his opponents. He believes he is all-powerful in his personal life and ends up frightening the ones he loves and driving them away. And eventually he doesn't believe that even the police can harm him, so he flaunts his indifference to the law when an underage girl comes to his nightclub. ""What're they gonna do?"" he asks. And then we cut to him in prison, where he belongs. <br/><br/>In solitary, obviously, he hits rock bottom, and in the movie's most painful scene he has a total mental and physical breakdown, slamming his head repeatedly against the wall. When he gets out he returns to the club scene as a completely useless stand-up comedian, and when his audience boos him he responds with insults, which is exactly his problem. He is the result of being ultra-famous and yet having no showman's talent whatsoever beyond the ability to hit people really hard. <br/><br/>In the end, we come back to the beginning of the movie, which showed an older and significantly fatter LaMotta in his dressing room preparing to go out on stage. He chants over and over again something of which he now has to convince even himself"

","8 out of 10 may seem high since I just called this movie overrated but the performances and the superb direction by Martin Scorsese help raise this score up a point or maybe two.<br/><br/>Raging Bull is often named the BP of the 1980s by many critics but I never understood how it could be that highly praised. In fact it might just be as overrated as The Shawshank Redemption.<br/><br/>Robert DeNiro is a tour-de-force in this film and he more than deserved his Oscar. Joe Pesci and Cathy Moriarty (whatever happened to her??) deserved their nominations and Nicholas Collasanto was good as well. I think that Martin Scorsese should have won Best Director for this by a hair over Robert Redford and David Lynch.<br/><br/>The film was so highly hyped (much like Shawshank) that it made me disappointed on the first viewing and while I think it is a masterpiece in terms of its great acting, directing, cinematography, and editing....the screenplay and pacing are what bring the movie down."
"jzappa","10","1","3","25 December 2006"," Life as a Boxing Match
","Robert De Niro, no matter what lesser films he's been in since and how marginal a few of his performances may have been in them, he will never be less of an actor than he is as Jake La Motta in Raging Bull. He is authentically disturbing, entirely becoming this awful man, transcending the universe. He does not play anything he does on screen. He is everything he does on screen. He lives and breathes his performance, and you realize that his portrayal runs so deep that it's no longer a performance in the traditional sense. It is haunting in a way that you must see to believe. I have never seen anything like it. There is a scene near the end of the film that makes me cringe reflexively, but all we really see is his silhouette.<br/><br/>The opening shot---the dim, hazy slow-motion shadowboxing of LaMotta's shrouded figure, the tops of the judge's heads barely visible through the shadows of the background, out of which the sporadic flash of a bulb will momentarily disperse---is not even a moment in time so much as a corner sketch of a moment in time, playing on endlessly and savoring itself. And it's a moment of heightened reality in the routine of a boxer: Those moments pumping up ringside before the fight begins. Scorsese manages to present his film with a moment so abstract and yet so pared down that many impressions such as mine can come of it. It's pure feeling.<br/><br/>The character that proceeds to pervade every scene subsequent is not just a crass, angry man with hang-ups. From the moment we see this man's domestic life, the way he treats his miserable wife and loyal brother, we see abominable behavior and not a single redeeming value. It's what generates such a potent undercurrent of unease in his tender, tranquil first scenes with Vicki, his gorgeous 15-year-old future punching bag who is filmed like an unsullied angel and thus seen as one by this brute, who is for the first time we've seen acting polite, friendly and gentle. But when he gradually lures her into sitting on his lap, we see a controlling compulsion in romantic affection's clothing, much like the terrifyingly gentle, placid scene in Cape Fear between Juliette Lewis' coy teenage girl and another manipulative De Niro sociopath. It's the precise sort of tension Scorsese builds throughout his textile of LaMotta's vicious soul, an undercurrent of his true bleak colors beneath the uneasy serenity.<br/><br/>The sudden, random violence that explodes incidentally and in the background of Jake's life is more than just part of a tableau of mean neighborhood streets of the New York Scorsese knows, as with other films in which he similarly uses shocks of realistic violence as a virtual aspect of production design. The shocking riot breaking out in the Cleveland match that opens the film, the brawls and arguments Jake and his brother pass by without reacting, the top-of-the-lungs fight Jake has with his wife ats which no one on the street bats an eye, these are the tableau of Jake's limited, insulated inner world. These are the things that he sees so regularly that his world can't make sense without it.<br/><br/>It's not a story of boxer Jake La Motta's life. It's a story of Jake La Motta's congested aggression and debilitating sexual hang-ups and how they affected his career in the ring. He would fight like he didn't deserve to live. He would punish his opponents like they were the root of his paranoia and anguish, and he would take beatings and punish himself for what he'd done wrong. This is inarguably Scorsese's darkest film. It broods deeply, much quieter and much more claustrophobic than any other film he's made."

The supporting actor Joe Pesci also like Robert De Niro's acting-some good but most bad. And i know that the film was released in black and white because of the mood and atmosphere of the film, but it lingers far too long. Finally the directing was class c from Martin Scorsese and most probably his worst film. The boxing scenes are meant to be in your face-bold, long, bloody and violent. Instead most of them are at least 30 seconds to a minute long, its pathetic. Even the final championship fight was only something like 30 seconds. It really does put a shame around Raging Bull and especially De Niro. <br/><br/>Too right, Rocky's better than Raging Bull.........

"lukesmyth","10","2","11","20 December 2019"," Nothing comes close
","Powerful, emotional, gripping and horrifying. A modern Greek tragedy. Scorsese's adaptation of La Motta's rollercoaster of a life shows a mans capacity to self destruct when he has no control over his anger and selfishness, leading him to lose the people he loves and relies on. La Motta's fights in the ring symbolize the fights he's facing in his own mind everyday. The ring is his judgement and showcases his true feeling, sometimes showing pure ferocity and aggression to his opponent and beating him until he is unrecognizable, and other times being on the ropes being the one taking the beating, but never letting himself go down, showing his stubbornness and disregard for his actions. De Niro's tour de force performance as the troubled man is by far his greatest, and Scorsese's incredible storytelling is at its best here. This is a film that will rock you to your core, and change the way you see consequences in your life and that of others."

","Scorsese has given us his share of snorefests and movies that look like they were hastily drawn up cardboard creations. Snorefests like The Age of Innocence. Unconvincing fake pieces like Gangs of New York.<br/><br/>He has also given us some gems. Gritty and witty films like Goodfellas and Mean Streets. Cleverly orchestrated biopics like Casino.<br/><br/>Raging Bull, fits neatly in the mediocre category, along with films like Kundun. Though it possesses some of the grittiness with which Scorsese seems more at home with than his pre-20th century period pieces, the script is flat out one-dimensional. Though realistically portrayed, Scorsese's directing and story telling is pretty much a bland delivery that shows none of the inventiveness a masterpiece like Goodfellas possesses.<br/><br/>I remain convinced that many of Martin's pieces are better off as documentaries.

","Scorsese is at his best when he's not taking himself too seriously. King of Comedy and Goodfellas are fantastic films because there's an upbeat element of humour in them. But Raging Bull (like Taxi Driver) is the story of a destructive nobody. True, De Niro and Pesci give fantastic performances. But I think the film's reputation has been falsely enhanced by the legend surrounding De Niro's performance. At the end of the film I was left wondering what had persuaded Scorsese to make a movie about LaMotta in the first place. 7/10."
"ibbi","10","1","4","18 November 2002"," Masterpiece.
","This film is probably the finest work to date from Director Martin Scorsese. Perhaps the reason for this success was the way in which Scorsese was able to realte to LaMotta through out the making of this film. Obviously Marty was going through many problems in his life and instead of giving up and retiring he chose to translate what was happening to him through this film.<br/><br/>He claimed that Raging Bull would be his final film and although this thankfully for cinema has not been the case it would have certainly been a fitting finale. Scorsese is on top form in his attempt to recreate the life of chaotic boxer Jake LaMotta and by all accounts he has done a first class job. His choice to shoot in black & white has given the film an impact it would be almost impossible to deliver in colour. The entire film is tragic because of this and all the more effective.<br/><br/>Of course when mentioning this film it is impossible not to mention DeNiro. To film LaMotta's life story had been his idea in the first place and he had pleaded with Scorsese since the 1973 on the set of Mean Streets to get this film made. it took him 7 years to finally convince the director in which time he had built up and impressive list of performance's in such top films as The Godfather Part II, Taxi Driver and The Deer Hunter, three very different performances in three very different films. Also along the way he had picked up two Oscar nominations and a best supporting actor win in 1974 for Godfather 2. However when he teamed up with Martin Scorsese in 1980 he would top them all.<br/><br/>Firstly DeNiro boxed over a thousand round with the real LaMotta and got into fantastic shape. The boxing in the film was 100% real and the fights were replicated exactly. Then came the next chapter in this amazing performance. Production was shut down for 6 months while DeNiro ""ate his way through Europe"". He visited many different countries and ate many different foods and in this time he was managed to put on 60 pounds(roughly four stone). This had a terrible effect on him as his body was not used to being in such shape but DeNiro's commitment to the project remained and he did not give in and  continued acting superbly until the end.<br/><br/>This film alo has admireable supporting roles from Joe Pesci as LaMotta's brother Joey. He gives one of his better performances here and while not to the standard of Tommy in 'Goodfellas' he really has an impact. His scenes with DeNiro are rather fantastic and there improvisational scenes are amazing as they play of each other so well(without a doubt one of cinema's greatest double acts.) Another honourable mention must go to Cathy Moriarty who plays Jake's wife Vicki LaMotta. This performance is made ven more amazing when you take into account that she is only 20 years old here. few actresses in this day and age can give such great performances at this age, she truly does seem tortured throughout this film.<br/><br/>Finally a nod to editor Thelma Schoonmaker who cuts this film together magnifecentlly well, the fight scenes particularly are absolutely majesticlly done. I get the feeling the film would not have been anywhere near as good if it wasn't for her.<br/><br/>This movie was voted the best movie of the 80's and rightfully so. It is amazing in all departments and deserved far more than the two oscars it won(Deniro:Best Actor,Schoonmaker:Best Editing) Scorsese was robbed as was the film itself by Robert Redford and his Ordinary People. A film which has vanished into obscurity, while this, 1980's true masterpiece is a film that will live forever in the memories of all as a tru;y harrowing and majestic piece of cinema."

","""Raging Bull"" is aggravating to watch. As an enormous fan of Scorsese's pre-2000 work, the catalogue of innovative, dark, gripping, and overall classic works that he did seem to be given the most praise, yet the least rewards. Knowing that DeNiro won an Oscar for this film, knowing that Pesci was nominated (but lost) and knowing that Scorsese was also up for one of those prized trophies, yet lost – is extremely aggravating. Martin Scorsese is one of the most influential directors of my time, and probably my parent's time as well. His body of work ranges from angry Taxi Drive, to a suspicious boxer, to a documentary about a Band, and even a comedy about New York after hours. The list could go on, yet modern audiences only remember him as the guy that brought us ""Gangs of New York"" or ""The Departed"", two decent films, but nothing of the caliber that his work from the early 70s had. How can anyone say that ""The Departed"" was more of an Oscar contender than ""Mean Streets""? So, upon watching ""Raging Bull"" for the first time – I was filled with anger and frustration. ""Raging Bull"" is one of those near perfect films that was released in the 80s, yet still seems powerful and relevant today. Perhaps it is the skill of Scorsese behind the camera to give us a non-linear biography of a man who has no trouble destroying his own life. Perhaps it is the sharp editing that takes, what could have been your average sports movie, and transforms it into this pioneering black and white, quick cut by quick cut, journey into the darkness of man. Or perhaps it is the actors, Pesci and DeNiro doing what was genius at the time (Pesci seems to have never let go of Joey La Motta in any of his future roles), and giving us lines, words, and actions that will remain in our minds long after the film is over? Perhaps. Everything about ""Raging Bull"" was perfect, yet the Academy turned away for ""Ordinary People"", thus Scorsese had to wait for the sympathy win to finally claim his victory. Anyone else find that aggravating? <br/><br/>Enough of me on my soap box trying to justify why Scorsese was robbed early in life, and let's talk about what made ""Raging Bull"" so exciting to watch. To begin, the casting of both DeNiro and Pesci was brilliant. The two of them had this chemistry (which would try to be duplicated again and again in ""Goodfellas"" and ""Casino"") which Scorsese could not have imagined. They brought to the screen a true presence of two brothers growing up in New York in the 40s, trying to cope with both fame and possible infidelity. There are points in this film where one has to question the sanity of DeNiro's La Motta and also be amazed by the way Pesci is able to keep up with DeNiro's rage. The two of them are the glue to this film. Their scenes are intense, yet delicate. They command the scene, yet give more of their character to you than most of today's actors. Then, like a pioneer in his trade, DeNiro does this amazing transformation from a guy hoping to make weight to a man gaining to demonstrate his downward spiral. It was like watching Bickle shave his head – you just cannot find determined actors like this in modern cinema.<br/><br/>To add to the amazing caliber of acting that Pesci and DeNiro commanded, ""Raging Bull"" demonstrated that Scorsese was a force to be reckoned with. Not only did he take the idea of a sports story and spin it on its head, but he also redefined the genre. Black and white cinematography, the slow-motion shots, the use of violence and language set in the 40s, and these brilliant moments where words make all the difference. One cannot watch a Spike Lee Joint today without seeing how Scorsese influenced them – his work, especially in ""Raging Bull"" can be seen through today's cinema releases. While my only argument with this film is the length of the picture versus the slowed scenes, I don't fault Scorsese for that. Schrader and Martin's screenplay wasn't perfect, but thankfully with DeNiro, Pesci, and Scorsese at the helm, the fuzzy edges were able to be cleared up.<br/><br/>I cannot say how influential this film was watching it for the first time. It is dark, it is depressing, yet the bold color of the characters – despite the black and white – come through stronger than other films watched this year. The acting is more than Oscar-worthy, they define this film and the early 80s era. My favorite scene was the shots of when La Motta was actually happy with his family – the shots filmed in color allowed us to see these characters as more than just celluloid imprints; they became real. My favorite sound – the flashbulbs going off during each match – this was just brilliant. Scorsese took an already iconic image and showed how his keen perception was able to make it better.<br/><br/>I cannot wait to watch this film again.<br/><br/>BRAVO SCORSESE, BRAVO! <br/><br/>Grade: ***** out of *****"
"bengreenb","6","1","5","7 July 2007"," The power of jealousy
","This movie shows us the power of jealousy. It shows us how it can ruin our own lives, and the lives of the ones we love. The film delivers on this potent theme through a combination of skillful direction, acting, and cinematography.<br/><br/>As far as the writing, I found it to be quite good as well. My only regret was that the character of the boxer's wife was not developed very well.<br/><br/>All in all, I highly advise this film to those who enjoy dramas and sports movies and epics. These are not genres I generally enjoy, but if they were, I would give this movie something like 7 or 8 stars rather than 6. I can see plenty of reasons why this would be seen as a classic in the eyes of many, but it's just not my type of film (I prefer sci-fi, action, comedy, thrillers, etc.) for reasons of personal taste. It's definitely worth a watch, though."
"TheTwistedLiver","7","1","5","25 August 2006"," Fantastic acting in a story with plot holes.
","Raging Bull ranks among the most talked about and most respected films of all time. For the most part this is justified. Call me crazy, but I found some major flaws in this film. First, La Matta's relationship with his first wife is obviously tumultuous, however, we see them argue, and then La Matta and his brother go out together, and of course La Matta meets and falls in love with the blonde Vicki, but after that point we don't see his first wife again. She simply vanishes from the story! The audience is left wondering, what happened to his first wife? Deniro's character shows very little wit early on with the exception of the scene at the club with his wife when he says ""Why don't i beat the sh#t of of bout of yous and then you can f##k each other"" Aside from that, he is humorless. Obviously a talented boxer, and an emotional wreck, at the end of the story, he jumps into being a Lenny Bruce type stand up at clubs and eventually opens his own club playing host to groups of people and is the life of the party! where did this side of his character materialize out of? How did this happen? <br/><br/>Overall, outstanding acting by Pesce and Deniro, but aside from that, major plot holes obscure the integrity of this film. As the old saying goes, just because its shot in black and white, doesn't make it art."

"weatherphobia","3","2","17","2 January 2010"," Worst movie De Niro has ever been in!!
","I wrote this review off-the-cuff..'please forgive' the spelling, grammar and English etiquette failings.<br/><br/>I've read the reasons Scorsese gave for filming in B&W but it took AWAY from some crucial scenes making the scenes one dimensional IMHO.<br/><br/>I also kept reading close to 100 reviews, print and internet, and it was all how this movie was so good they thought GOD himself wrote, directed and starred in all the spots. I was VERY VERY Disappointed.<br/><br/>De Nero just came off as a dumb fighter with only one way of fighting (get punched nearly to death in 15 rounds OR knock them out in 10 seconds of round one) They could have done fewer minutes of the pretend sex because it was so drawn out slow and painful. ALSO 'she's 15 years old'?? Who thinks that? I saw her as easily in the mid-late 20s. How many 15 year olds in the 1940s were that Tall and have breast enlargement surgery? Also, pouring a pitcher full of ice water down his pants to get UN-excited about the 25 year old 15 year old.. Was it common in the 1940's-1950's to just have a pitcher of ice water waiting in your bathroom at all times? I would have caught that ERROR in mere seconds, anyone else? I gave this a 3.0 because I think that is just enough to give credit for the time they took to make the scenes, and to make all those copies for the theaters across the country.<br/><br/>Pesci you could tell was holding back a lot. No one, brother or not, would have taken the verbal and physical abuse he did without dropping out of the scene far sooner. You could tell on Pesci's face how he was holding back.<br/><br/>Also, Scorsese must how given Di Nero one instruction for the entire movie 'Never smile, no matter when or what never smile and never act happy content or even felling okay'...and that made it hard to spend more than 2 hours. I caught myself wanting it to end after 20 minutes.<br/><br/>SPOILER SECTION:The XXXX scene of punching a brick wall a few dozen times AND busting his head against same brick wall. I expected to later see, or THEN, numerous excessive bloody shots. Doing that would force your knuckles through your skin after 10 or so punches easily. Hasn't anyone in anger ever punched wood? Notice how easily your knuckle skin breaks open and then the excessive pain? And the head butting? I recall being dumb playing tackle football with friends and our heads hit each other and this was ONE time, the pain was like a migraine for 3 days and the swelling...I was shocked and thought maybe I should visit the ER? I'm sorry but that 2 minute scene was so crazy laughable it hurt me.<br/><br/>In defense of De Niro. Robert De Niro in my opinion is by far the greatest film actor, past or present, ever to exist. Brando is a top 5 but De Niro just goes all out for the part, does dozens of retakes and is so convincing 'goodfells for example' I used to wonder how many real mafia men fought for his autograph and buy his diner. It's sad to see this movie but at beast it lowers his score for him that I hold from a 100 down to maybe 99.999, he could do 10 terrible movies and his personal rank wouldn't drop below 95, people I think this man is THE actor and only God knows what worthless job he'd been doing all these years if not for his career."
"StarWarsMoviesSuck","3","1","6","15 September 2019"," Mediocre Oscar bait for its time
","I remember being a teenager trying to justify the movie to myself. Black and white was supposed to make it special. The violence, verite', and 'honest' acting was supposed to make it relevant. Most of all, the concensus of movie critic books that I glanced through couldn't be wrong, could it? 4 stars out of 4, etc etc.
Now I just view it as boring and exploitive, of Lamotta, no less. I'm sure he adored the movie, but it only focuses in, with a clumsily implemented style. on the bad elements of LaMotta's life, failing to show complexities, and failing to provide any redemptive arc.
Despite showing all of the abusive behavior, there's no genuine element of self-reflection in the movie, despite the fact that LaMotta was completely
forthright about his life and his demons.
I think the movie would've been far better in the hands of another director.
Oh yeah, the boxing scenes are ridiculously staged."
"lagudafuad","6","1","6","4 September 2012"," Not as grand as they say
","Well Raging bull is a movie that drags and after a while picks up and then drags on till it ends, this movie to me does not leave up to the classic rating it gets.<br/><br/>It tells the story of Jake LaMotta an Italian American Boxer; it is based on his (LaMotta) book Raging Bull: My Story. Robert De Niro portrays LaMotta a sadistic and jealous individual.<br/><br/>De Niro came across the story during the shooting of God father II, he showed it to Scorsese hoping he would make the movie, but Scorsese turned it down and after nearly dying from a drug overdose, Scorsese agreed to make the film for De Niro's sake, not only to save his own life but also to save what remained of his career.<br/><br/>After the script was made, both Scorsese and De Niro spent two and a half weeks on the island of Saint Martin, extensively re-building the content of the film changing what needed to be changed and adding what was missing.<br/><br/>The film was then made with a plot that shows how LaMotta rose to the top with the aid of his manager, and then due to his anger issues and jealous rage threw it all away and fell back to point zero.<br/><br/>The photography was nice; shooting in black and white didn't stop the movie from passing across its message. The movie helped launched Joe Pesci's career as the acting in the movie by all that were involved is an A+.<br/><br/>Locations used in the movie, well the set that was used will make you think you were in the 50s, as the set were well designed. Cinematography in the ring during the fights is something I did enjoy, as the camera got all angles and the blood flying too was well worked into it.<br/><br/>The other sad thing about this movie other than the length is the fight choreography, you can see at times that the punches were not landing and they were faked.<br/><br/>This is one of the eight movies that De Niro and Scorsese made together and not one of their best as Goodfellas still remain their best.<br/><br/>Not to put a damper on the mood here, but to me Raging Bull is a nice watch once and that is that."
"Brawl_666","6","1","6","3 August 2010"," career zenith for De Niro & Scorsese
","Jake LaMotta is a middleweight boxing pro. Inside the ring he's an unbridled sociopath. Outside it, he's a very, very typical and unremarkable product of his age. He's an emotionally weak, testosterone-crazed loud-mouthed roughneck, as conservative and bourgeois as they come. He's terribly paranoid about people, and has a knack for alienating his friends and peers. He's also intensely chauvinistic, seeing women as no more than f**k toys and domestic chattels. His extreme paranoia about other people's motives, his basic unsociability, his lack of self-awareness coupled with his intense jealousy for his beautiful wife inevitably destroy him. At the end, he is thrown onto the garbage heap of civilization.<br/><br/>People say that Raging Bull is the ""we'll make our point so obvious that there's no way you can miss it"" type of film. In a way this is true, because there is no ambiguity about it. It is equally true that the director is so aware of his intentions, so clear about the material he is handling, and at the same time has so much command over his craft that his film succeeds in communicating with almost anyone who watches it. Raging Bull is Scorsese and De Niro at their peaks, individually as well as in collaboration."

"The_Film_Cricket","4","1","12","5 October 2014"," Raging in every way . . .
","It is a little strange that the most unforgettable image of Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull is one of the quietest. Jake LaMotta stands defiantly in the boxing ring with his hands out to his side, bloody and peering from beneath his sweaty, swollen brow. I can think of nothing else but a nature documentary of a close-up of a Tiger ready to attack. There is a fearsomeness to his gaze, a warning not that LaMotta might attack his opponent but that in a matter of moments he will be destroyed. The moment contains no words but it speaks volumes.<br/><br/>Raging Bull is a biography only in the clinical sense, it is absent of all the trappings of biopics, there are no clichés, no unnecessary flashbacks to help us understand where his temperament comes from. Yes this is a movie with boxing but it's not a boxing movie, it simply an examination of a man caged by his own demons who uses his profession as a manner of venting violent tendencies and sexual repression. Of course, they leak at home too, especially in the direction of his suffering wife Vickie.<br/><br/>In some ways Jake LaMotta reminds me of Travis Bickle, the subject of Scorsese's earlier film Taxi Driver. Both are men who manage to succeed in doing something that makes them a celebrity. Jake demolishes his opponents in the ring while Bickle murders pimps and child molesters in a tenement building. Both are volatile men and both are doing something reprehensible but somehow they managed to become pseudo-heroes in their pursuits.<br/><br/>And like Bickle, there is never an effort to make LaMotta sympathetic or heroic, he's a bastard, he knows it, everyone around him knows it and so there you are. It's tempting to label him as one-dimensional but that's not inaccurate. He is a one-dimensional man filled with loathing, rage, sexual insecurity and frustration. He reminds me of the kinds of people who release aggression by cutting themselves, only in his case he found absolution in the ring, beating his opponents to a bloody pulp.<br/><br/>Raging Bull continues a theme present in most of Scorsese's films, the hero's inability to relate to women. Just as Travis couldn't relate to the 12 year old prostitute Iris in TDaxi river, Jake can't relate on a realistic level with this wife Vickie. They're relationship (at least from Jake's point of view) takes on a kind of ""from my cold dead hands"" attachment. What fuels him sexually is his rage at the very thought of another man attracting her. There is a moment when Jake destroys a man in the ring that she has complimented. When the fight ends he look, not at his opponent but at his wife. It is both acknowledgment and a warning.<br/><br/>For Jake, violence is sex. Sex itself is a frightening concept to him because he seems to suffer from the Madonna/Whore complex in which his wife stands in place of his absent mother. Violence in the ring is the sexual stimulation that he is missing. Twice in the film Jake breaks into childish crying fits: The first after he throws a fight (thus robbing him of his sexual dominance and the second after he had been jailed for selling an underage girl for sexual favors. In both cases he seems to have been robbed of something that he dominates. Also too, Jake's reputation in the ring is that he has never been knocked down. In the losing decision against Suger Ray Robinson, Jake leaves the ring but reminds his opponent ""You didn't get me down, Ray - You didn't get me down"".<br/><br/>It's appropriate that he chooses a woman with whom most men would want to seek company. He dares them to so much as look at her and she does little to fuel their fantasies. Jakes insecurity and sexual inadequacies keep him distant sexually but he replaces it with the jealous rages. Impure thoughts about Vickie are, to Jake, a sin and the wages of sin is death or at least severe punishment. His brother Joey receives the worst of the violence but so does Vickie That volatile relationship becomes the theme of the film. He can't enjoy sex with Vickie because his sexual release comes in the form of violent jealously. For his inadequacies he married a woman that is, to him, perfect. She's angelic but not a waif, she's friendly but (from what we see) not easy. In a way, Jake would like to see her that way because it allows him a certain amount of contact, even if he is knocking her to the floor.<br/><br/>The casting of Cathy Moriarity was, I think, a masterstroke. She is tall and solidly built, she seems to dwarf Lamotta who is strong but a small man. This disadvantage fuels his insecurity. She's not a weakling and she fights back, if she were a waif cowering the corner the relationship wouldn't have the psychological complexity. Consider how Jake sees Vicki. There are point of view shots in which he observes the way she seems to float toward other men. He has won her for his prize now he obsessively convinces himself that she is cheating on him.<br/><br/>Watching Robert DeNiro's performance as Jake LaMotta is to play witness to the basest human animal, he is caged inside the form of a man, a lion in the jungle full of rage and hunger and sexual fury and a fearsome sense of territoriality. Freud could have written volumes about this man and, indirectly, he probably did."

","It's not a bad movie. It's actually pretty great. No movie has portrayed boxing the way this one has, however (and a big one, as you can see from my rating) it's not for everyone. Black and white, some still shots, an occasional color gives the movie charm, but it's slow paced, seems to be leading to nowhere. That's why I couldn't bring myself to finish it. Watched an hour or so, but watching the mediocre acting and not so great dialogue, weird actions from characters, I was a bit dissapointed. But I hope my review doesn't hold you back from watching the movie. You should see at least an hour of. Or maybe even finish.
And hey, maybe one day I'll decide to watch it again. But this time fully."

","Martin Scorsese's picture Raging Bull is a compelling film blending the raw yet intricate talents of both Scorsese and Robert De Niro. An excellent example of Scorsese's favorite topics, Raging Bull follows championship boxer Jake La Motta on his obsessive mission to be the greatest. This journey is well portrayed in what may be the least glamorous depiction Scorsese has used. In his later films, such as Goodfellas and Wolf of Wall Street, Scorsese has a tendency to somehow romanticize morally reprehensible characters. In this 1980 movie, however, this is notably absent.
La Motta is depicted with an undeniable honesty, with the performance of De Niro to thank for that. This ""salt of the Earth"" character instead comes across as one who has salted the Earth on a self-destructive tear through life that leaves a sizable wake of destruction. The film opens with an aged La Motta preparing for a stage performance. The rest of the film proceeds through a flashback of sorts through his younger days, as a boxer and as an all-around disagreeable human being.
Between scenes of boxing matches with different outcomes, such as fixed or thrown fights, we see La Motta's questionable-at-best lifestyle on display. From actively pursuing a fifteen-year-old girl, to his paranoia and instability leading to domestic violence and family destruction. In the end, La Motta has not learned to accept responsibility, and continues to blame others for his fate.
The film closes with a quote, ""All I know is this: Once I was blind, and now I can see."" This can be viewed as a call to forgive and redeem La Motta. However, it also brings to question whether he could be redeemed at all. Raging Bull is notable for its brutal honesty regarding the negative details of Jake La Motta's life. In the end, it appears as though he has learned the minimal amount about himself and his actions to be able to sleep at night. Ultimately, his character behaves inexcusably. All have their reasons, but it is unsavory to only seek redemption at the bottom of life without fully accepting blame.
Furthermore, the question of redemption for the film itself is raised. Stylistically, this movie has many interesting choices. Immediately, the choice of black and white cinematography is striking. It helps immerse the viewer in the 1960s boxing world, as though one were watching footage of the fights themselves. However, as the film goes on, it serves to only amplify the lack of vibrancy in story. The dialogue comes across very natural and unscripted. Again, this begins as an endearing element, however throughout the movie causes interest to wander.
Fans of Scorsese's other work may find it difficult to appreciate Raging Bull. Arguments of morality aside, Scorsese has a way to make abhorrent characters somewhat likeable throughout a movie. The lack of this darkly comedic touch makes this movie less compelling than others by this talented filmmaker. Furthermore, Scorsese's trademark voice-over narration is absent. These voice-overs help engage the audience, giving further insight into the protagonist's thoughts and motives. Without this unifying element, there are points in the movie where the relevance of the scene is simply unclear.
Despite this, it is still an excellent film worth viewing. Using a recognizable cast of actors, Scorsese once again crafts a story of violence, immorality, and crime. The audience is forced to question if and how they relate to these characters, and why. And if not, what is so compelling about watching such destruction? Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Frank Vincent, among others, serve as pillars in Scorsese's projects, and he shows that he knows how to direct these actors for their best performance."

","The movie is strong on its vivid screenplay and the acting by Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. The screenplay is so vivid on the depiction of Jake LaMotta's behavior. The story goes on quite slow in my opinion and it looked like it didn't put enough time for the boxing scenes. the fights on the boxing scenes seemed to unrealistic for me. The sound effects sounded like something from a sixties movie. But it's quite good to include the famous element of Italian American culture of ties to the mafia. De Niro's acting is just truly superb. His facial expressions are nicely fitting just as what he did in ""The King of Comedy"" for comparison. He went total for this by gaining weight to make his suitable look for the older version of LaMotta."
"Leofwine_draca","6","0","4","2 July 2014"," Not Scorsese's best
","Don't get me wrong: RAGING BULL is a strong movie, featuring some great technical expertise and top-notch direction from the reliable Martin Scorsese. It also happens to feature a pair of excellent performances from Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. But something in the film leaves you cold, cold enough for me to place this far behind the likes of TAXI DRIVER, GOODFELLAS and CASINO.<br/><br/>The problem with the film is the script, I think, which fails to make much headway with Jake LaMotta's character. Yes, the film is all about a portrayal of a man who turns out to be a monster, but there's not much of a character arc. LaMotta stays the same from beginning to end, but the film as a whole lacks the grandiose nature of something like SCARFACE, which told a similar story but in a much more dramatic and cinematic way. In contrast, RAGING BULL is cold and a bit depressing.<br/><br/>There's still much to like here, though, and inevitably De Niro's performance stands head and shoulders above all else. De Niro undertakes a dramatic physical transformation for the role years before Christian Bale made it trendy to do so, and he's absolutely electric. But, again, he's played characters that are much more interesting in other films. I just didn't think much about LaMotta despite the interest of the warts 'n' all scripting. Trust Scorsese to get another fine performance from Pesci, though, the first of three stunning acting performances from the actor/director combo.<br/><br/>On a final note, RAGING BULL comes recommended thanks to THOSE fight scenes. In contrast to the rough 'n' tough bouts of the ROCKY franchise, these are extremely violent and yet also extremely artistic; probably the best filmed of all sports sequences in a movie. I just wish that Scorsese hadn't gone for black-and-white, though, as I think the movie would have been more effective in colour so you could see every drop of blood. It reminds me of Tarantino's hand being forced into making the huge set-piece massacre in KILL BILL VOL. 1 black-and-white."
"ShootingShark","6","0","2","16 August 2013"," Acclaimed But Heavy Going Biopic Drama Of Skilled But Self-Destructive Boxer
","In the forties, Jake LaMotta is an aggressive middleweight boxer from NYC nicknamed The Bronx Bull, who is desperate to get a shot at a big title. Things are looking up after a series of successful fights, but can Jake control his temper and his possessive streak ?<br/><br/>Raging Bull is a movie I both admire a lot and simultaneously don't really like, which I think was partly the intention of the filmmakers. It's a mixture of frenetic, intense boxing scenes, which leave you gasping and are among the best ever staged in all cinema, and blunt, drab, kitchen-sink domestic squabbles which are beautifully played but stark and squalid. They deserve kudos for depicting Jake's life with unflinching honesty, but his suspicious, intolerant, violent nature goes on and on for about three times as many scenes as necessary. If you watch the 2004 animated children's film Shark Tale, there's a great scene where a puffer fish (voiced by Scorsese) and a shark (voiced by DeNiro) argue about what each other meant by using the word ""what"", which is basically all the drama in Raging Bull condensed into thirty seconds. Where the movie really scores though is in the style, and particularly in Michael Chapman's fabulous black-and-white photography. The fights are all beautifully shot, with dazzling cuts and different approaches for each of them - the rings seem to stretch out to eternity at points and close into tiny arcs at others. Every conceivable angle is used and the horrific bloodbath of LaMotta's final 1951 showdown with Sugar Ray Robinson is particularly stunning. I'm not quite sure what to say about DeNiro's Oscar-winning turn as LaMotta, which some cite as one of the best performances of all time. As an actor disappearing into character it's most definitely an amazing piece of work (DeNiro famously gained sixty pounds for the fat scenes and learned to box to a professional level), I'm just not convinced that's what an actor's job is. The film does a terrific job of evoking the period and recalls the stylish pictures made by Martin Ritt or John Cassavetes; it reminds me of a comment the latter once made citing a great compliment was when someone said they didn't like his movie but they couldn't get it out of their head. Featuring great sound design and an inspired use of period source music - Jake's main theme is the beautiful Intermezzo from Mascagni's one-act opera Cavalleria Rusticana. Scripted by Mardik Martin and Paul Schrader, based on the book by LaMotta, who is still alive (aged 92) at this time of writing, and lovingly dedicated to one of Scorsese's film professors, Haig Manoogian. Boxing movies tend to be formulaic, where the protagonist is a moral man who triumphs over adversity. If nothing else, Raging Bull rejects both of these ideas and gives us someone who survives his harsh environment through sheer tenacity alone."

","I only watched Raging Bull finally and for the first time a few nights ago to avoid one of the despised questions critics get asked: ""You call yourself a movie critic, but you haven't seen?!"" <br/><br/>Truthfully, I didn't have much interest in ever seeing the almost-32-year-old film. I have to be dragged to sports films, like Westerns and Musicals. Although, I generally end up liking them – I loved Chicago, and had to be dragged to that one, too – it's still a chore for me to get started with them.<br/><br/>And the nice thing about this film experience is: I knew practically nothing going in. I literally popped in the DVD and pressed play. Prior, I only knew it was directed by Martin Scorsese, starred Robert De Niro, was black & white and centered on boxing. That's it. I didn't know the length – which I love to know for what I'm getting myself into at night. I didn't know if it was a true story. I didn't know it also starred two favorites of mine: Joe Pesci and Cathy Moriarty. (That last one was interesting; within a period of one week, I saw two brand-new-to-me Moriarty films: this one and Neighbors. Although, it was revealed that I did see Neighbors prior, I was only seven and I only recall blurry memories and that I had seen it.)<br/><br/>I like these movie-watching experiences, i.e. going in almost blind. It was as if I saw it for the first time opening weekend, December 19, 1980, before everyone had their opinions, praise or whatever published or spoken.<br/><br/>At any rate, I enjoyed this piece of work. The cinematography was superb and crisp. The acting, namely De Niro and Pesci, excellent, as was the score and music. And I believe this statement must have been said countless times before: the direction (by Scorsese) was so masterful, so perfect, this film should be taught in film schools on how exactly to direct a movie.<br/><br/>The movie follows Jake La Motta's (De Niro) boxing career from the beginning to (ha-ha) present (in 1964) and we see the absolute rise and self-destructive fall of the paranoid fighter. This time bomb and his nickname, Raging Bull is so blatant in both the ring and in his personal life.<br/><br/>Honestly, I could've made that synopsis even shorter, but that pretty much sums it up. There really isn't much story here – it is based on true events, after all – so the movie relies and rightfully so, on the beautiful black & white, mood, acting, camera angles and suspense (for when La Motta will crack for the x time.) And none of these are bad things.<br/><br/>Exceptwhen you get into the pacing. As mentioned, since the story is thin, there are far too many stretched out scenes that had already moved past the established ""mood"" in the beginning of said scene. For instance, the courtship between second-wife Vickie (Moriarty) and La Motta wasn't just enormously awkward, it seemed to stay on the screen for much too long.<br/><br/>Also, I'm wondering if it was a budget thing, but EVERY SINGLE RING La Motta fought in, no matter the city, looked 100% the same, including the spectators, smoke and ""mysterious"" darkness beyond rows 5+.<br/><br/>Eh, I know that's really incidental to the fantastic and one-of-a-kind shots taken within the ring, namely the best of all fights: the final one between La Motta and Sugar Ray. That one scene was worth the entire time of film.<br/><br/>Although it's not a movie I will probably ever see again – as stated: this isn't my type of genre or subgenre, I would still recommend it, especially at over-30-years-strong, it holds up for both normal movie-watchers and film students.<br/><br/>Side Note: I don't think I've ever seen Robert De Niro this young, or, hell, even this thin (for the most part of Raging Bull.) So watching him here, I could NOT help but laugh every time I saw him with his sharp and curly hair inches above his head and NOT think of John Turturro (from Rounders.) Literally, for the first half I had to remind myself: this is De Niro, not Turturro.<br/><br/>Side Note II: Since I stated, I haven't seen De Niro younggo ahead and ask. Ask the question I hate: ""You call yourself a movie critic, but you haven't seenTaxi Driver?!"" Yes and yes. And yet."
"morria03","4","0","8","18 March 2012"," Raging Bull is about Jake La Motta's life and how he dealt with his anger inside the ring and outside the ring and what it ended up costing him.
","""Raging Bull"" is about Jake La Motta's life and how he dealt with his anger and aggression inside the ring as well as outside the ring. The violent behavior served him well inside the boxing ring but cost him everything outside the ring. As he won fights he slowly lost the family and friends that were close to him because of his violent behavior and jealousy. This film was made in black and white to set it apart from other boxing films coming out at the same time, such as Rocky II or Rocky III and The Main Event. Jake's power and speed was captured in the slow motion scenes and the sounds.<br/><br/>Jake La Motta (Robert DeNiro) is a very violent boxer who along with Joey (Joe Pesci), his brother slash manager climbs the ladder in the boxing world, by destroying his opponents one by one in his own way, until he finally gets a chance to fight Sugar Ray Robinson. His violent behavior mixed with his jealousy and paranoia follows Jake into his personal relationships with his family and friends. The theme surrounds how his violence in the ring, which takes him to the top of the boxing world, will also spill over into his personal life and will bring Jake to the lowest point in his life which will leave him all alone.<br/><br/>His brother Joey has connections with the local mob boss named Salvy (Frank Vincent), who helps him get a title fight with Sugar Ray Robinson, on the condition that he lay down one fight first which he does and is disqualified. Jake wins six or seven fights in a row and ends up fighting Sugar Ray Robinson twice. The second fight, Jake actually loses because the judges decided to rule in favor of Robinson because he was enlisting in the army and leaving the boxing world for a period of time. Jake would not let that loss get him down and went on to win one fight after another.<br/><br/>Jake along with his brother Joey visit a local swimming pool where he spots a fifteen year old girl named Vickie(Cathy Moriarty) and falls in love with her instantly, despite the argument brought to him by Joey, that he was already married. Jake eventually divorces his first wife and marries Vickie but then becomes dangerously jealous of her, often times accusing her of falling for other men, including his brother. Jake starts a fight with Joey, who decides not to be Jakes manager anymore. Jake ends up in the ring all alone wishing his brother was there.<br/><br/>After a few years, Jake announces that he would retire and had bought a nightclub. Vickie tells Jake she wants a divorce and would take the children with her. Jake would then be arrested for allowing underage girls in his nightclub and connecting them to older men. Jake is convicted and ends up serving time in jail where he finds himself all alone again. Jake violently pounds the jail cell and cries and finally realizes that he is all alone. He eventually runs into Joey in a parking lot and gives him a hug, after being released from jail.<br/><br/>This film is a lot like ""Rocky"" but much more violent. The movie ""Rocky"" was about a boxer, who fought his way to the top of the boxing world, inside the ring but allowed it to affect his personal life in a negative way. He became a champion in the ring but almost cost him his family outside the ring.<br/><br/>The camera angles capture the intensity and the violence in Jake's face as well as his opponents faces through close-ups and slow motion scenes throughout most of the fight scenes. The uses of slow motion in the boxing scenes, as well as the sound effects represent or capture the idea of superhuman strength and speed throughout Jake's fights. This represents the violence that Jake carried into the ring but also spilled over into his personal life."
"rennix","Null","0","1","23 September 2003"," Strong De Niro - weak script
","This is clearly De Niro's best performance. He was the driving force behind this movie and talked Scorsese into it. This is also the first time that he worked with Joe Pesci. So it's a good idea to watch this before you go on to Goodfellas or even Casino, where they've also teamed up. Watching these two fine actors is more than delightful. Hell, they could do American Pie 8 and it would still be worth watching. Most of De Niro's and Pesci's lines are ad-libbed and improvised. That's how good they relate to each other. And Scorsese gives them the freedom to do so.<br/><br/>The downside of Raging Bull is that the script is very uneven and has a timing problem. Since the studio rejected the script several times De Niro and Scorsese did some rewriting and later on got Paul Schrader into the boat to straighten things up. Schrader later said, that at the end not much of his draft was left in the script.<br/><br/>And this is pretty obvious when you watch the movie. Aside from the scripts it is a technically brilliant movie with fascinating shots and a wonderful musical score.<br/><br/>I love it, despite it's obvious weakness."

"dmikester","Null","0","1","3 September 2000"," An excellent film, but not even close to the brilliance of Taxi Driver.
","Raging Bull is a tragic movie, but for different reasons than what most people think.  It is tragic simply because it is a wonderful piece of cinema marred by a completely banal and two-dimensional character.  I am certain that the novel was much, much better than the film's screenplay, and that it more accurately portrayed La Motta's character.  La Motta said upon seeing this film that he came across as an ""uncouth, insensitive lout,"" and I couldn't agree more.  In fact, he comes across as nothing more than that.<br/><br/>In every Scorsese film I've seen, the main character has always been someone the audience could and in a way had to attach to because they were so real. When Scorsese got into their head, you saw exactly what they were thinking and understood them because they were just like you and me: human.  In Raging Bull, La Motta has absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever, making him inhuman and, as he is called many times during the film, an animal.<br/><br/>Sure, he can love people and care about them, and yeah, he is pretty funny, but what happens to those qualities during the movie?  He beats his wife and fights his own brother based on his belief that the two were having sex and<br/><br/>she ends up divorcing him.  During a scene in a bar when he's doing stand-up, he genuinely insults a guy and is laughed at out of nervousness more than out of amusement.<br/><br/>De Niro was flawless as La Motta, but at the same time, I couldn't help thinking throughout the film that he was just as good or better when he portrayed Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver.  The only reason that La Motta is even tolerable is because De Niro dedicates himself completely to the role. However, no one but the scriptwriter could have made La Motta a three-dimensional character.  As a matter of fact, I think people see this as De Niro's finest work simply because he made the main character someone you could at least partly identify with and not feel completely detached from.<br/><br/>It is incredibly ironic to me that Travis Bickle, a completely fictional character, is more real in Taxi Driver than the real-life character Jake La Motta is in Raging Bull.  What's interesting to note is that in Goodfellas, Scorsese seems to learn that perhaps portraying someone with complete accuracy doesn't always provide for a great story, and therefore fictionalized the story of Henry Hill and made him someone that the audience could accept and connect with.<br/><br/>Raging Bull is an excellent film, but it is nowhere near the level of excellence that Taxi Driver and Goodfellas are.  If De Niro hadn't completely committed himself to the role, and if he wasn't so good at romantic scenes and giving angry glares at people, this movie would almost be unbearable based on the main character alone.  If you decide to see this movie, and you should, just remember that you're only seeing part of a real human.  Look at him as a fictional character with no redeeming qualities, and you will enjoy this movie much, much more."

This makes me think that the producers used the success of Rocky to create buzz for this film.  Rocky also won best picture, something that Raging Bull cannot say.  And finally, Rocky is such a more likeable character, and a fictional character that will live on forever.  Perhaps this is not fair, since Raging Bull follows a real life fighter, but in my opinion Rocky should be considered the best boxing movie of all time."
