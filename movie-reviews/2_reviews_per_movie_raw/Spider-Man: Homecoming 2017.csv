","Please take my review with a grain of salt. I don't really write reviews, but I really felt compelled to say something about this movie and it's decaying genre.<br/><br/>I'm conflicted, because I know my opinion is getting more and more jaded with every new superhero flick- but I am quickly reaching the end of my rope here. All these movies feel so predictable and clich√© anymore, and as much as I truly want to enjoy them it is becoming more and more difficult.<br/><br/>The main actors in this movie were pretty good, but what can you do with yet another weak story that has already been rehashed in other films. The writing felt subpar, and in the end it came off as being full of gimmicks and convenient sub plot.<br/><br/>It just doesn't feel real anymore, it doesn't feel believable. It feels like a fantasy world created for superfans who never take a step back and critique.<br/><br/>These superhero movies are becoming more and more uninspired, and while I try to give them all a chance I am just getting tired of it all. It feels like the quality is being diluted, all that matters anymore is the quantity. All that matters is the money.<br/><br/>I still hold out hope- just look at the 'zombie' genre. Just because there is dilution within the genre doesn't mean a sporadic gem can't be made. However, if you are of a similar mindset as me, you might want to keep looking elsewhere.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!"
"craigearl","6","281","431","24 July 2017"," Hugely disappointing
","As a lifelong Spidey fan I was expecting good things of Homecoming. Sadly - and I appreciate that I seem to be in the minority - it did not deliver for me. <br/><br/>Let's start with the positives: Michael Keaton's Vulture was everything a villain should be with an added layer of charm and depth. The high school setting and our youngest Peter so far was definitely a step in the right direction (Tom Holland is a very capable actor although though his voice did grate after a while). Even the menacing Mac Gargan, a potential 'Scorpion', was a great addition.<br/><br/>Now the negatives. I think the casting for Flash Thompson, Liz Allen and Ned Leeds was absolutely ridiculous. Flash is supposed to be a jock who bullies Peter - not a smaller Asian guy who is also a member of the same quiz team! And that throwaway 'M J' comment at the end - unforgivable!!! <br/><br/>The costume AI also didn't work for me. I appreciate that this is a tool to integrate Spidey into the MCU - but for me he works better when he is on his own, a guy in a cloth suit overcoming the odds with a mixture of bravery and science. <br/><br/>I can appreciate that Homecoming had some issues to get over, especially as the other movie incarnations covered his unique origin in such depth. Was it brave to avoid the origin altogether - or did it detract from really getting us onside? Maybe a 20 minute opening section with Peter narrating, recapping his origin might have helped...<br/><br/>I've no doubt that younger viewers would have enjoyed this movie (and maybe that was the aim), but fans of the 60's, 70's or 80's Spidey might have wondered what had happened to their favourite wallcrawler.<br/><br/>For me, the first 45 minutes of Raimi's 'Spider-Man' nailed it and SM2 was equally as good. My GF, who has no knowledge of the Spider- Man lore, left the cinema with me and remarked 'that was the worst one'.<br/><br/>Though I don't necessarily agree with that comment, I certainly wasn't ready to hail SM:Homecoming as an all conquering triumph, instead a rather weak chapter in the MCU series.<br/><br/>Sorry Spidey, I so wanted to love this movie! Maybe better next time..."
"oublalelekaka","1","258","409","8 August 2017"," Worst spiderman movie ever
","Seriously the worst Spiderman movie I've watched. The first three movies in my opinion were the best. In this film Peter Parker is portrayed as a hyperactive, silly, and immature teenager. They make him seem very weak and unimportant compared to other avengers. Furthermore I disagree with the use of gadgets and high tech suit. This is not how Spiderman should be portrayed and remembered. Honestly Spiderman is my favourite superhero and I grew up with him, but with the original Spiderman not this silly version and I'm just sad that people will now have this view of Spiderman instead of how Spiderman used to be and SHOULD be."

"uworicher","5","772","1299","6 July 2017"," Spit in the face of spider man fans
","Spoilers and review coming from a Spider-Man fan. I want to say if I knew nothing about Spider-Man, this movie was good. But sadly I loved him and grew up with spidey. The movie was a typical marvel movie and funny at parts. But the rest, they hurt my inner child ruining spidey. <br/><br/>Tom Holland was a great Peter Parker and Spider-Man. But the producers and creative team behind this, ruined Spider-Man. I don't know how Stan lee could could happy with this. My god. They ruined Spider-Man. Spider-Man never needed a high tech suit, with all the gadgets and a damn voice helping him like batman and iron man. They made him look pathetic and took away his intelligence. Spider man relied on his abilities, not tech. This movie made iron man look responsible for the creation and power behind Spider-Man. Any kid could have been potentially Spider-Man with iron mans help then. Other than sticking to walls according to this movie. No spidey sense and no further explanation on his abilities. <br/><br/>Next, the flash. My god what were they thinking with him? A small Indian kid, smaller than tom Holland even?? Not a jock and hardly intimidating. That's not flash. He's suppose to be a dumb jock and bully. Not a hardly noticeable nerd bully on a math team picking on Peter. <br/><br/>Aunt may. What...why they make her a hot mom figure. She's suppose to be old, not long luscious hair and sexy. People hitting on her all the time. Why?? <br/><br/>Spider-Mans webbing was lame and made him look oblivious to using it. He barely created it, tony did all the work. Other than a moment in class we saw him making some and the end where he used his old webbing. <br/><br/>His love interest was lame and they made the vulture her dad??? Really? And then end put a nail in the coffin. The Michelle random character....calling herself MJ. Please no. She cannot be or replace Mary Jane. And can't even nod to Gwen Stacy. <br/><br/>There was so much political correct crap in this. I don't mind changing the characters into other races, but doing it just for the sake of doing it was lame. Making flash Indian, making his friend who also could be the hobgoblin Asian, and probably maybe getting rid of Mary Jane as Michelle who is black. Does Hollywood have something against red heads?? Every girl or hero who has red hair in the comics is never ginger. <br/><br/>The shocker was terrible. No custom and lame. And they needed two of him too? Stupid. <br/><br/>Just everything about this movie killed my inner child and spat in my face for making comic book and cartoons of my beloved Spider-Man a waste of time. <br/><br/>Oh and people figured out who Spider-Man was quickly. The vulture, his friend, iron man obviously, and drum roll....his aunt may. Already aunt may?? Unless they make another movie and add a dumb excuse like, oh I just like the costume and I made one. How stupid. <br/><br/>I'm sorry to tom Holland for being involved in this. This was not a true version of Spider- Man. If you know nothing of Spider-Man then you'll probably enjoy this movie. But if you know anything about him, his story and who he is, Hollywood shat on it. <br/><br/>RIP spidey in the movies. They can't get a simple concept down of him. They have to add a bunch of garbage. <br/><br/>This is my one big review of a movie and I never bothered to make one this in depth, but I couldn't keep it in. Plus the post credit scene was even lamer at the very end. To add to that, they brought back the ugliest captain America costume that made him look like a joke in the first avengers."
"rrmin437","1","106","165","27 September 2017"," Not even a good movie let alone good Spiderman
","The movie plot was so basic and they still had to explain through dialog what was happening, so you'd know...<br/><br/>Very little character development. Not even for this Parker... You cling to what you know of spiderman of past stories to fill in the gaps, but, then the new character disappoints.<br/><br/>Like all new movies, they can't seem to write things actually happening. They need to look at old movies and remember how to shoot and edit things so that actions happen. planking on top of a building shouldn't eat up 2 minutes of movie time...<br/><br/>Can you imagine what editing and shooting must have been like with real film ?? And they still can't even come close to older flicks in terms of content and story... What is this? Lazy? Cheap? No longer any talent in the industry? Maybe they should stop focusing on politics and learn how to make movies again.<br/><br/>Spoilers....<br/><br/>The suit thing is dumb, he becomes a ""soft"" version of iron man.. with webs.. What happened to spidey sense? Maybe I missed it.<br/><br/>Sorry, but, you need an actress for aunt May, not a body... just sayin.<br/><br/>For all that happens in this movie, he saves like 2 people. He has to be saved by iron man and his best friend. By the end of the movie, who doesn't know he's spiderman?"
"natalie-1024","1","155","250","8 October 2017"," Spider-Man The Parody
","I'd have given this film a rating no stars had it have let me. A lot of the reviews on here have said that this film is only enjoyable for 12 year olds. Well, as the mother of a nearly 10 year old who hero worships Spiderman and has done for most of his life, he certainly didn't find this enjoyable. He is annoyed at how feeble they have made Spider-Man in this film. A few minutes into the film, I asked my husband if this was a parody, and unfortunately it just got worse."
"Asuka-Fan","1","452","766","13 July 2017"," Worst movie adaptation of Spider-Man ever
","Did the Homecoming writers actually think that pushing together the 2 split halves of the ferry boat would stop the boat from sinking? And why did Iron Man just fly away after pushing the 2 split halves of the ferry boat together, without even checking if any of the passengers might be injured and need to be air-lifted to a hospital? And why were there cars on the Staten Island Ferry? Don't the writers know that cars haven't been allowed on the Staten Island Ferry after 9/11? And why doesn't Spider-Man have Spider-Sense in MCU? When Peter ditched Liz at the Homecoming dance and leaves the building, he gets ambushed outside by 1 of the bad guys. No way that should happen with Spider-Sense. So he definitely doesn't have Spider-Sense in MCU.<br/><br/>Also, the absurdity of the Washington Monument scene. The elevator of the Washington Monument gets blown up by a bomb that the fat kid had. DHS would've interrogated the fat kid about where he got the bomb and the fat kid would've been held in custody until he gave up Peter as the guy who gave him the bomb.<br/><br/>Then DHS would've investigated Peter and would've been suspicious as to why Peter at the last minute decided to re-join the Academic Decathlon after quitting the team earlier and travel with the team to Washington, D.C. only to skip out on the Decathlon competition and the skip out on the team's trip to the Washington Monument on the same day that his best friend blows up an elevator in the Washington Monument using a bomb that Peter gave him. And DHS would've gotten a warrant to search Aunt May's apartment.<br/><br/>Just more bad writing, as is usually the case in MCU movies.<br/><br/>In addition to the bad writing, SMH's shallow and uninspiring portrayal of Spider-Man's motivations make SMH the worst movie adaptation of Spider-Man ever. Without outright mentioning Uncle Ben's death, Peter being Spider-Man is reduced to a simple show-off. There's nothing driving him other than wanting to look cool and impress Tony Stark - and that's a shallow reason which betrays his true comic origins.<br/><br/>Superman is shown by Jor-El how he can unite the human and Kryptonian species and bring hope to Earth. Batman is driven by the death of his parents and vows to do everything in his power to stop crime in Gotham. Wonder Woman feels that it's her duty to end war and bring peace to Mankind.<br/><br/>Those are noble reasons which are inspiring. Spider-Man is in 1 of the 4 most iconic comic-book superheroes along with Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman. But his motivation for being Spider-Man in Homecoming isn't because he believes he has a ""great responsibility"" to use his powers for good (as he learned from his failure to prevent Uncle Ben's death when he could've) but simply because he's hoping to get a reply from Happy Hogan."
"johnny_joko","2","196","323","7 October 2017"," Spiderman is now Iron Man 2.0
","This was straight garbage. I think that it probably was the worst superhero movie in the last 10 years. The only positives in it, were some special effects and The Vulture character, who was the only one with a compelling story in this film.<br/><br/>Now, before I get into the negatives, I want to point out that Spiderman is in my top 3 Marvel superheroes. So the fact that I hated this movie says a lot...<br/><br/>First of all, Peter Parker is supposed to be 15 in this movie and in reality he looks like he is 11. How am I supposed to take a superhero seriously if he looks and acts like an 11 year old? The second mistake that was made, is that they completely changed all characters in the Spidey universe. There is no Mary Jane here (except for that stupid MJ thing at the end which almost made me vomit), there is no Gwen Stacey, Flash Gordon is an Indian geek guy that for some reason Peter is so afraid of (he even backs out from him at at some point), Peter's best friend is absolutely worthless and is just a complete pain in the ass, we have almost no interest for Peter's love story cause the director fails to make us care, the battle scenes are average, almost every joke in the movie is juvenile and cringeworthy (I think I only laughed one or two times) and the most important thing of them all, Spiderman is made to look like he is worthless. That last thing is my biggest problem with this movie. They made Spiderman wear a high tech suit that talks to him and has all kinds of fancy gadgets and as a result they made him look like a less useful version of Iron Man. Tony designed his suit, his webs and essentially every other thing that this suit has. The only ability Spiderman has, is his ability to be able to climb walls since they also took away his spidey senses... So by that, anyone could have been Spiderman and that's just wrong since, for most people, Spiderman is Marvel's biggest hero and this one COMPLETELY fails to showcase that. Highly disappointing film and I recommend to avoid watching it since it will be a waste of your time..."
"thebosontheory","5","67","104","27 July 2017"," Very disappointed, not what Spider-man should be
","I walked into the cinema with really high hopes for this film. I fangirled over the Metacritic score of 73 and was ready to be amazed. Instead I was very disappointed.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, the film definitely is entertaining and I probably would recommend that you go watch it, but I'm just saying that you won't be missing much if you don't see it. Tom Holland did do a very good job with the role of Peter Parker and I praise him for that, it was the writers and the casting directors that did a bad job.<br/><br/>The casting choices for this film were absolutely ridiculous! I admit Tom Holland, although I was nervous at first, he did do a good job. However everyone else is an extremely poor choice. In the Amazing Spider-man with Andrew Garfield, the character of Flash was a butch jock who was very intimidating to Peter and was the school bully. However in Homecoming, he is an Asian science geek who is somehow popular and just awfully name calls Peter. I mean ""Penis Parker""? Who wrote that?! The casting choice of Peter's crush is interesting too. I'm not entirely against it but it was just a weird choice in my opinion. And Michael Keaton as the bad guy? Seriously?! Don't get me wrong, Keaton is a fantastic actor and is incredible! But he is way too old to play a role like this and does not belong here.<br/><br/>One of the things that really ticked me off was the Spider-man suit itself. Going back to Toby Maguire's Spider-man, his suit was original. It didn't have anything fancy, it was just a superhero costume with a good design. But in Homecoming, the suit comes with it's own ""Jarvis"" like Iron Man's suit, and it has gadgets as well which just isn't how Spider-man should be! Even though the most entertaining part of the film is when he is wearing this suit, most of the film he isn't even wearing it!! He wears a stupid hoodie and trousers and it just isn't fun.<br/><br/>I understand that I lot of people enjoyed this film but I just wasn't impressed."
"QAOSbringer","1","66","103","4 October 2017"," What is the ""Best Spidey"" about this?
","Spider-Man is one of the most famous superhero out there. We've seen different reincarnation over time, many different cartoons, comics and even movies. But in the core, there is a ""true"" Spider-Man version, based on 70s and 80s comics. Both 80s and 90s cartoons were adaptations of those adventures. 90s cartoon had more modern and better art style and animations, Therefore, most fan take it as the most faithful adaptation of the comics.<br/><br/>Spider-Man movie made by Sam Raimi had its polemical issues, like organic web shooters. With the second movie, he sorted the bad aspects of the first movie and only amplified the good aspects, and created a really good movie with the spirit of classical adventures. But at the third movie, he went into a wrong direction and it become the downfall of his series.<br/><br/>When Sony wanted to reboot the series instead of a new sequel, they created a version more faithful to the Ultimate Spider-Man comic books. That movie was not bad, it was fun, but it was not ""the classic Spidey"" and there were mixed reactions for this one. Gwen Stacy in this movie was so good that they wanted to recreate the classic story about her for the second movie. But that movie failed hard, harder than the Spider-Man 3, even if it was not that bad.<br/><br/>Sony had to reboot Spider-Man once more. This time, they went to Marvel for their help. But Marvel had its plans about ""new version of Spider-Man"". They were pushing Miles Morales FOR A LONG TIME. In their mind, ""real Spider-Man should be Miles Morales"". Therefore they were mocking with the Peter Parker for a time. For example Ultimate Spider-Man cartoon. They alienated their own fans with that cartoon and cancelled creatively beautiful version of Spectacular Spider-Man just for that cartoon.<br/><br/>When this two forces collide, we got the Spider-Man: Homecoming. Everyone loves this movie, praises it, even in IMDb everyone believes this is the ""best spidey"" since the beginning of time. Why? Because Marvel tell us so. We must obey them and praise this shitty version of him.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. I also was hyped during the Civil War movie. We've seen a part of him there, it reminded us the Classic Spider- Man especially with that cool costume.<br/><br/>However, they changed the ""Classic"" image in the movie really really much.<br/><br/>One of the problem in the movie, they are trying very hard to be ""SJW-friendly"". Most of the cast changed into ""People of Colors"" and of course that means African American or Mexican people. America believes ""People of Colors"" only means African American and Mexican. And of course, this is the current year, so, they put PoC everywhere. Flash Gordon, that ""white supremacist"" looking bully? Yes, he is a PoC hipster now. Liz, love interest of Peter Parker, of course PoC. Sidekick for Peter? Of course PoC. What about a MJ substitute, definitely PoC.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I don't expect a yellow hair blue eyes white supremacy idealism in the movie. But I also don't want modern day politics pushed even above Spider-Man. We didn't have to hear how producers of this movie disapproves slavery by a very planned dialogue. Please leave us from your forced politics.<br/><br/>This is because Marvel changed this movie into a ""Disney XD"" show. Even the ""Aunt May"" changed into a Disney XD style MILF mom. Where is our beloved Aunt May? Nowhere. This is the current year, old is outdated and hipster is the new cool.<br/><br/>""OK cut the crap man, we understood you hate the SJW politics, What about the Spider-Man?"" Sadly this Spider-Man version is even worse. He turned into whipping boy for Iron Man and his enemies. The famous loner Spider-Man is now an errand boy for Tony Stark. Every time he talks with his phone, movie feels like to do forced and rushed jokes to ""entertain"" its young audience. No, Spider-Man you are not funny, cartoon adaptation of this movie is even less funny. After all these years, we still stuck at high school level. Even in comic books, he finished high school very early and started a young adult life. Even 80s cartoons and 90s cartoon happens in that period. But hey, we need to do Spider-Man a teenager just to appeal teenagers. Right?<br/><br/>The worst part of this movie is, following the modern movie style: everything is so staged, timing is planned and nothing happens natural. This stupid trend makes the movies artificial and synthetic. And it destroys the immersion for the audience.<br/><br/>If you really believe this is the Best Spidey, then please at least go and watch the Spectacular Spider-Man cartoon."
"Will_Harrison","8","237","400","21 July 2017"," A 'spectacular' Spider-Man movie that proves that Spider-Man's still got it.
","Jon Watts (Director of Clown and Cop Car) perfects the character and charm of Spider-Man that we all love from the comics without doing disservice to either fans of both the Raimi and Amazing Spider-Man franchises with a fun superhero movie oozing with joy with its great cast and characters, big and small, as well as an 'amazing' performance from Tom Holland who brilliantly combines what Maguire and Garfield brought to the character by truly demonstrating the differences and similarities between the awkward nerd Peter Parker and the quippy crime fighting Spider-Man. The film also gives many critics of Marvel's lack of great villains what they want most, a relatable villain that is as, if not more, interesting than the hero itself and not only is great adversary physically but also psychologically and we see this with Michael Keaton's excellent portrayal of the Vulture. What Spider-Man: Homecoming does best, however, is its attention to detail and world building put into the town of Queens, which feels more real and believable than any other fictional world we have seen in the MCU, making Spider-Man: Homecoming one of the best chapters of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and another great example for future superhero movies to learn from."
"etercolor","1","84","135","26 July 2017"," Totally Mess
","I usually don't don't listen too much to critics or reviewers when I want to go see a movie, and I try as much as possible to not have any expectation or preconception. This time I regret deeply for not listening to users who have warn us not to go see this movie. It is the first movie where I felt I was being robbed and I wanted my money back. It was so bad that it took forever for it to end. I am SHOCKED when I see the rating of this mess. I just can't believe people rated so high - it is beyond me. Does teenagers really accept this low standard? How could Marvel accept this nonsense production is another interesting thing to meditate. Side-by-side, Iron Man 3, The Amazing Spider-Man series or Batman vs Superman look like masterpieces when comparing to Homecoming. <br/><br/>Some reviewers had the actual nerve to say this is better than Spider- Man 2. What?! It's like comparing a Rembrandt to a kitsch painting - yes, it's that bad. <br/><br/>One IMDb user described exactly how this movie is: like a very long trailer for something cool - something that never appeared on the screen. Too bad, because I really liked Tom Holland. <br/><br/>I refuse to go review on detail because it really doesn't deserve the attention. <br/><br/>I warn everyone that wants at least a decent flick: DON'T go see it, as you will regret it! <br/><br/>I just really don't get how this have 8 stars.

","The movie S-U-C-K-S. Not exaggerating one bit. Everything feels so generic, CGI is so bad it almost feels like watching video game cut-scenes during the action sequences, there is nothing really going on despite the fact that Peter wants to convince Tony that he is worthy to be an Avenger (childish all the way- what a hero!). Emotionally empty movie with silly jokes and Easter eggs, bad- indifferent cinematography, bad performances from everyone (Holland is NOT Peter Parker, Keaton did his Beatlejuice mannerisms once again, Marisa Tomei cute as always but miscast, the rest of the cast either underdeveloped or amateur at best). This movie is just suits and tech. I could go on bashing it forever not only for not being loyal to Spiderman comics but also for being more of a TV show rather than a movie. Forgot to mention that there is a lot of stupidity throughout the movie for instance no physics in there (plus more but I'd have to go frame by frame to discuss those). <br/><br/>Never before in my life have I been so baffled from the critics' and audience's consensus. 93% on rotten tomatoes??? WTF! We deserve junk like that then. Since you like talking movie morals why don't you all take a minute to think about this: If the cinema is going downhill maybe YOU are responsible too (since you like garbage like Spiderman Homecoming)"
"amichnea","1","125","207","8 October 2017"," Worst Marvel film so far (worst Spider-Man)
","I am a huge Marvel and DC fan, not crazy about the accuracy of things as long as the overall story is told.<br/><br/>I actually loved the original Spider-Man movies with Tobey Maguire and even though there was no need for a reboot the ones with Andrew Garfield were pretty great too. Both versions had Gwen Stacy (first love) and Mary Jane (2nd love) and both versions had the Spider-Man origin, which more or less stuck to the actual comics.<br/><br/>Spider-Man Homecoming takes everything everyone knows about Spider-Man and throws it out the window. As others have commented no idea how Stan Lee accepted this... if he had any choice at all. <br/><br/>Bear in mind that the Marvel hero rights is a complicated matter, they belong to different groups and they could have the last say. Spider-Man belongs to SONY Pictures and not to Marvel Studios, obviously this latest film was a collaboration of the studios. Most of the X-Men stuff and fantastic 4 belonging to 20th Century Fox. Seeing an Avengers/X-Men/Fantastic 4 movie crossover is highly unlikely... shame as the comics did it.<br/><br/>Going back to this movie, they simply bastardised Spider-Man, everything that made him special is gone, his back-story and origin is gone. If you have no idea who Spider-Man is, if you did not watch any of the earlier movies then you will love it as there is nothing wrong with the film besides Spider-Man's non existent sense of responsibility towards anyone or anything. Destroy that family's house, sure who cares; blow 100 cars up, yeah why not; almost killing 100's of people go ahead Spidey that's what makes a hero. Everyone finding out your secret identity hell why not... As an added bonus and insult, Spider-Man now has an approved Stark suit on, just remember never to enable KILL MODE!!! No idea what would happen if you do, would love to see it though:) OH and of course as many other reviewers have said, throw in the politically correctness, use every race and mix it all up (Red Heads, Blondes and big white jocks... make them all clever, Mixed Race, African-American and Asian-Indian).<br/><br/>They could have just simply done a Spider-Man Origins movie... AGAIN and then crossed over with the Avengers. They could have used either Tobey Maguire or Andrew Garfield without upsetting the fans. Simple, Iron man needed help during the Civil War and Spider-Man was a Pro-Registration or whatever. The Civil War was a lot more complicated than the previous Captain America film with a lot more heroes including Fantastic 4 and the Spider-Man group but hey at least that was more or less on point.<br/><br/>P.S. Two of the people I was watching the movie with fell asleep:)))"
"amrish2808","1","61","96","4 October 2017"," Absolute disaster
","Not caring about the history, an abuse of CGI. Forced diversity to not offend the liberal idiots.Peter depending more on technology of his suit rather than himself (like in the spiderman comics), Aunt-May being too young... In other words, they ruined Spiderman. Next time they make a movie, I hope they don't think about that diversity crap and make the movie properly."
"gtrboy-35664","1","471","827","7 July 2017"," Bad, Marvel's self-sabotaging with jokes. Raimi's Spider-Man 2 still the best.
","With good CGI and an interesting take on The Vulture, but extremely cringy jokes forced in seemingly every line of dialogue, bad acting by everyone except Keaton and Holland, and the inexplicable reason to have Iron Man & his tech dominate a film that isn't even his (and make Spider-Man seem weak/dependent). SM: Homecoming is disappointing. 4/10<br/><br/>... *Spoilers* (Compensating for shockingly overrated reviews)<br/><br/>I don't want it to seem like I'm a hater. I love Spider-Man. He's my favorite Marvel hero and one of the first ones I ever followed as a kid. But, that doesn't mean I can just ignore this very flawed film, especially when critics are unfairly over-inflating reviews for Marvel movies again (literally every one gets 90%+ when maybe 1/3 of them deserve that high.. fishy) and even mentioning it in the same sentence as ""greatest superhero film ever"" when in reality, it's not even the best Spider-Man movie.<br/><br/>Let's start with the bad. First, the jokes. Literally almost every line of dialogue in the movie had extremely cringy jokes forced in centering around immature and stupid things like puberty, Larb (you'll understand once you see it), male body parts (repeatedly, Flash is soooo clever with that joke man), pretend-hugging to open doors, and Zendaya's hipster girl hating on everything & flicking off the camera for no reason. I understand Peter's in High School, but the jokes were INSULTINGLY juvenile & unbearable even by MCU's joke standards (which have been bad). I really want to like Marvel's movies and do for many of them like Civil War and Winter Soldier, but I cannot explain this weird trend they've been on recently to kill their own movies with overloaded humor and make the movies jokes instead of art.<br/><br/>Also, the acting and characters except for Michael Keaton and Tom Holland were just horrible. Usually don't go into superhero movies expecting Oscar-level acting unless it's The Dark Knight, but this was so bad I felt the need to point it out. Spider-Man's overly giddy best friend is annoying and overdone in superhero movies, while every other supporting character like Zendaya's hipster girl who hates everything, Flash Thompson who is completely miscast, and Aunt May who people bizarrely crush over are dull, uninteresting, and badly acted.<br/><br/>Next, the one I came into the theater fearing the most: Iron Man and his tech DOMINATED the movie when it's not even his. I like Iron Man, but his forced shoehorning into a movie he had no business being in was a hated decision by many from the beginning (myself included), but was worse than I thought it'd be. He, Happy, and his tech in the suit literally make up 3/4 of the movie, so much that it's made to seem like Spider-Man is weak and dependent on Stark's tech when in the comics he doesn't have an ounce of that sophisticated tech. Also, he is belittled by Tony constantly, a fact that as a Spider-Man fan, I find absolutely infuriating when Spider-Man is Marvel's best/most recognizable hero.<br/><br/>Finally, the film is riddled with plot holes, action scenes not nearly as wowing as other superhero films, and forced diversity. Spoilers- E.g., how could aunt May not see Peter's suit when he reveals to Ned for the first time and puts it on the ground when she walks in? Also, the movie begins after Avengers in 2012, then jumps ""8 years"" to 2020 but is after Civil War in 2016??.. The diversity in the movie is so overly forced to copy WW's praised real diversity that it ends up rubbing off the wrong way like it's a last-second afterthought to increase box office #'s instead of cleverly working it in. Every single couple in the movie is biracial, which is cheating diversity-wise as it's the easiest by FAR to write in. Finally, there were sequences that were just dumb, like the selfie video sequence that lasted a good 15 minutes in the beginning of the film. <br/><br/>While there was a tornado of cons, I looked for positives too. There were bright spots. For one, the new suit looks great. Having an All-CGI suit was actually a good idea as it came out beautifully, even if I hate how they made it too tech-based. The CGI throughout the film was admittedly good as well, especially in Vulture's case, although with an insane budget like this movie had, that should be a given instead of an achievement. Holland was a good Spider-Man, although he sometimes overplayed the role by talking too much.<br/><br/>Also, Michael Keaton as The Vulture was great. Keaton is a gifted actor (Batman!) and gives a new light to a previously cheesy villain and makes him likable. His character was well fleshed-out and his take on the character fascinating, which is why he should be even more upset the rest of the movie did not perform to his level.<br/><br/>Overall, I came in wanting to love this movie as much as I loved the originals, but was very disappointed. Convinced there is something going on here as I cannot possibly explain how the MCU gets 90's every time from critics, influencing the public perception into wanting to agree based on the basic psychological want to agree with people of perceived higher authority like critics instead of thinking differently.<br/><br/>Raimi's Spider-Man 2 = still the best Spider-Man film by almost EVERY metric of cinema.<br/><br/>Most Memorable Moment: Plane-side Spider-Man vs Vulture fight<br/><br/>Pros: Good CGI and a great Spider-Man suit, good performance by Holland although occasionally overacted, great performance by Keaton<br/><br/>Cons: Extremely cringy jokes forced in seemingly every line of dialogue, bad acting and characters except Holland/Keaton, Iron Man and his tech dominate Spider-Man's movie and make him seem weak/dependent, plot holes, forced diversity by lazily making every couple biracial instead of writing in cleverly, action scenes not as wowing as previous MCU entries<br/><br/>Rating: 4/10"
"gigula","10","188","324","17 July 2017"," Another Spidey?
","Another try to show us the same angsty story about power and great responsibility? Wrong! Peter stuck in the middle of the teenage drama? Not quite! Spider-man as an Avenger? Well.... let me stop you there. My first impression when the trailer came out was, well I had a lot of doubts. For instance why there is no Uncle Ben, why Peter's best friend knows his best-guarded secret (that has been reviled in the comics only to help Iron Man's team during Civil War). Aunt May who is even less aware of everything? Iron Man in the background? No 'Friendly Neighbourhood Spider-man'? But then I went to see the movie and to say, I was pleasantly surprised. We got the whole need look at Peter Parker's life. First of all, we've never got to see Peter so young, though Andrew Garfield and Toby Maguire tried. He looks young and he is young. His life isn't exactly defined by his uncle's death. Sure it is implied but at the same time, it doesn't imply that this is why Peter became Spiderman. What we also got to see is Peter who learns how to be a hero. This kid really got one of the most solid moral core among the heroes. And now we can see how he learns how to do his job. It's no longer than 5 minutes of speeded process of embracing the powers, where in one moment he breaks the tap, can't control his 'sticky' powers and performs superhuman reflex and the next scene he has his suit made and his powers under control. No. And that's why it's good. It's funny, comical even, but true. Peter is true, he eats larb, builds lego Deathstar, studies for Spanish quiz, and saves the day. The other thing that surprised me was how well Tom and his real friend Jacob played the dynamic duo of Peter and his 'guy in the chair' Ned. It gives us a bit of fresh view, innocent even when it all is a game, an awesome adventure. And it also gives us A LOT of good humour. Then next we've got Aunt May, who is building a new life with Peter, starting over. She also has some kind of different innocence than we've seen before. She supports Peter and is just a bit more than an episodical character needed for the plot. Another character that has been rebooted is Flash Thompson, Peter's bully. Of course, he still is a bully, but the writers decided to expose the other side of him. For me, it gives a glimpse at the future where after all Peter and Flash became friends and Spider-man's ex- bully becomes a hero, Venom. Additionally, we had a chance to witness Happy's great return, yay!? And finally RJ, we are here. He did good, what did you expect. But he didn't steal the show, oh no. it was A Spider-man movie from the very end. Another pro of the movie is that there is no romance-centric plot. It's not always about getting a girl people! Moving on, that scene! You know which one! You didn't see that coming? Because I didn't. Simple yet great plot twist. But enough about the plot. Then again, the marvellous Marvel logo that constantly gets better and SPIDER-MAN THEME! That's right! The music was good, even though I was hoping to get another catch and a great soundtrack like we had in GoTG and GoTG vol2. Another thing that got me surprised was the camera. We've been served with a whole lot of scenes from new, and different angles. We got lots of different perspectives. General, big, from point of view and the best of all Peter's vlog from Germany. Last but not least brilliance of the credits. It really makes you want to sit there and wait for the credits to end, not like we wouldn't do this anyway. ;) I heard someone saying that they were disappointed with Peter. He was making a fool of himself. He was constantly saying: ""I'm sorry but I gotta go"" and couldn't get the job done right from the take one. But isn't it just how his life goes? because from what I know it is. Peter is one of the most relatable and at the same time tragic (ok, maybe not that tragic) comic characters. Because of he always, always does what is right. No matter what. he sacrifices his personal life, his love his happiness to make the world a better place. This is the reboot. This is the beginning. This is young Peter learning to be a hero. Him learning about power and responsibility. Learning to stay closer to the ground. And even though teenage Peter being pulled into high schools drama does sound clich√© it paradoxically isn't. It's good. It's funny and it's just simply Peter Parker's life.<br/><br/>PS. Don't miss the extra Cap's message, straight from Middletown High."
"VanillaMint69","Null","314","560","3 September 2017"," Overrated Garbage! Worst Spiderman Movie EVER!
","Spideman: Homecoming was TERRIBLE and by far the worst spider-man film. This movie was a HUGE set back for Spiderman but sadly we live in a very tight lip controlled marvel press that have told us this is ""great movie"" because it came from another soulless product cake factory from marvel. This is the same Spiderman/Peter Parker from Civil War??? They severely dumbed him down for his solo movie and turned him into whiny clumsy idiot who screwed up constantly. Despite that Tom Holland is the best on screen Peter Parker and Spiderman to date. He deserved a MUCH better movie.<br/><br/>I like Michael Keaton but his performance felt phoned in only to find that Keaton turned down this role twice before excepting it. Not his fault, am I'm the only one who thought the Vulture was lame? He was so hollow and them tying it up with the whole Damage Control thing felt forced and rushed.<br/><br/>The high school stuff in this movie is awful. This movie was trying to so hard to be a John Hughes movie and it failed miserably. Homecoming was nothing like those movies. The teens in those movies were real, they smoked, drinked, swore, and acted like real teens. The supporting teen cast in Homecoming are nothing but terrible caricatures. Liz is a stock love interest with all the personality of a dry brick. She's useless and Laura Harrier and Tom Holland have zero chemistry. I never bought that these two liked each other. All they're very few scenes together are awkward. Flash was turned from a big jock bully bully into a annoying little doucebag who's about as threatening as a newborn kitten. Ned is stock fat friend comic relief who's not funny at all. Michelle was some wannabe hipster Daria type girl who hate everything. She served no purpose and the twist with character at the end was so forced and stupid. Aunt May's transformation into an object of male gaze/desire (and nothing more). No mention of Uncle Ben which is ridiculous. I didn't need to see him die again, but replacing Tony Stark as Uncle Ben's place as a father figure is absolutely ludicrous!<br/><br/>Dull washed out cinematography. This looked like a TV movie. Michael Giacchino's uninspired score. Bad CGI on Spiderman, it looked WAY too cartoon. The action scenes were forgettable and had zero stakes. The Rubble scene had potential but it was poorly done, rushed, and ruined by water reflection with Tony's voice over. It's sucks because Holland acted his but off in that scene. All the Avengers/MCU references were forced and shoehorned it was eye rolling. The worst was the F, Marry, Kill game with Thor, Hulk, and Iron Man during the gym class. Really??? Speaking of gym class, those Captain America PSA segments were unfunny pointless filler. Jon Watts was a poor pick to direct this movie. His direction is bland and uncreative. He also doesn't know how to direct action scenes. At least the Raimi movie had their own distinctive zany kooky style. Homecoming looks like every other MCU movie. This movie also had 6, yes SIX writers and it's shows.<br/><br/>The The forced diversity is so in your face. His best friends is Filipino, love interest is biracial, his bully is Guatemalan, weird girl is black, the Chinese and African kid on the decathlon team. No story-line progression. The movie is Peter wants to impress Mr. Stark to become an Avenger. That's.... it. The terrible childish comedy. ""Hur duh penis parker"", ""I was watching porn"", ""your aunt is so hot"". This is the comedy were supposed to laugh at? What was with the cringe built by slaves comment in the Washington scene? That has no place in a spider-man movie.<br/><br/>Bottom line! Spiderman: Homecoming is another over-hyped Summer blockbuster that will be forgotten about after a month which is exactly what happened. These MCU movies have no staying power. I already forgot Guardians 2 came out 3 months ago. By the way that movie also sucked too!"
"Saramargard","10","189","330","20 July 2017"," Stellar movie...but what about Spider-man?
","Oh Spider-Man, we meet again. It's been a long time since we saw tantalizing Tobey Maguire in the suit. Spidey was in need of a comeback- oh wait, I forgot that already happened...Andrew Garfield this one is for you! <br/><br/>Okay but for real, this movie was great. It hit on every truthful aspect of Peter Parker. Geeky high school teen with great angst, a need to prove himself and get the girl he supposedly loves. I would 10/10 recommend it to anyone as one of the greatest Marvel movies every made (it definitely lived up to it's reputation), but what about the greatest Spidey movie every made? <br/><br/>I agree that there has to be major differences between this movie and the other two heart-throb tales because Spider-Man is now official in league with the Avengers. But caught in the crossfires of the Marvel Legacy, was the movie even about Peter Parker? I mean, did they even have to try to make it about him? Everybody already knew the story so why bother retelling it? I believe a better title for the movie may have been Iron Man 4-Tony Stark's Coming of Age. <br/><br/>The Marvel makers seemed to have realized that they already created a vast empire so adding in Peter Parker shouldn't be difficult at all; if we remember to keep the main stars close behind... <br/><br/>I may still be a little too attached to the previous web of spidey movies to believe that Spider-Man is now part of something more than just himself, but it may have been nice to stick a little closer to the reality of Spider-Man's true nature. He is a lonely, angsty teen from queens, but he seemed to be still on the back burner to the bigger starts cameo-ed in his own film. Maybe that was the point though...right?"

","Turns out this juvenile Spidey is a bad guy who would have sunk a boat, destroyed a historic monument because of his obnoxious ignorance and crashed a plane into a city but all he got ""lucky"" and no casualty occurred, except enough property damages amounting to a cost which could easily surpass the budget of this film. All of this why? cause he just wanted to avert a robbery!! Seriously? call police or simple message someone responsible about this instead of doing stupid tricks and putting everyone lives in danger! I hated this spider-man for his utter immaturity and for no loyalty to the comics. This spidey is just a sham, tony is the hero here.<br/><br/>Moreover, the vulture came out to be a good guy at the end! All he was doing is to make some money like Stark did in his earlier days! Instead of sharing the tech with the world they made it illegal, what will a person do who lost all his money? Sell that thing in the black market cuz it's illegal now."
"george-jacobs","10","157","274","6 July 2017"," Amazing Spider-Man once again continues to be amazing
","Tom Holland's first spider-man film has me anxious for more from the new marvel hero. The acting was fantastic and hands down the best spider man movie yet. Micheal Keaton did fantastic as Vulture and although Bokeem Woodbine was a smaller role as shocker he did a great job. This movie finally gives us a MARVEL spider-man that actually takes place inside the marvel universe. The scene with the MJ reference ,although being a cool little quirk, could've been left out do to the fact the characters name is Michelle but hey what can you do. This movie is the spider-man I have been wanting my whole life, definitely worth a watch and really looking forward to more."

"aaiieyezcs","10","172","304","21 July 2017"," This is AWESOME.
","I'm a huge fan of SpiderMan. I was grown up with this hero's movies, animated television, etc. I'm the one who always likes Peter's invention. I think many of you might think like me about his suit. It seemed to be a big nothing if Tony Stark wasn't helping Peter with his tech support but if you watch this movie and open your mind. you'll understand what he wants to prove himself like as Tony said ""If you're nothing without this suit, then you shouldn't have it."" So In my opinion it's this version that finally puts a truly portrayal of #PeterParker. Tom did great job. I love it.<br/><br/>I've watched it in three projection systems. In my personal opinion 4DX is kind of exhausting.. but it would be more fun if you see it in the normal screen or IMAX first. I always prefer #IMAX as it enhances my movie going experience. Moreover, I've seen Peter's face on big screen with full of my eye."
"alec-81277","10","174","308","9 July 2017"," What a Spider-Man movie should always be
","Let me start by saying Spider-Man Homecoming is an absolute blast. It's everything you could want from a Spider-Man movie. Tom Holland did a fantastic job as Spider-Man. He was an interesting, lovable Peter Parker and an absolutely classic Spider-Man. Michael Keaton was an exceptional vulture. You couldn't ask for a better actor to play him. This also had a lot of very comedic moments so if you enjoy comedies, this would be a good movie to see. This is how Spider-Man should always be. Lovable, funny, kind of awkward and witty and that's exactly what we get from this movie that we didn't fully get in The Amazing Spider-Man movies. I noticed some people were comparing to Spider-Man 2 and saying which one was better. I think they are both awesome but they are also very different in certain ways. Overall, this is a fun flick for the whole family to watch. Not much more you could have asked for."

"IgniteOscar","10","148","260","6 July 2017"," Refreshing Spider-Man
","Considering this is the sixth Spider-Man film since the start of the noughties. It is really positive the fact Marvel was able to successfully bring in so many fresh ideas. It is also worth noting how many good jokes they were able to get into the film that had not been covered in the previous five. Obviously, one thing that was an advantage to this film is it went into an already established cinematic universe when the others didn't have that advantage. Tom Holland portrayal was witty and linked all the other characters really well. It was also nice to see Gwenyth Paltrow make a cameo as Pepper Potts. Nice to see the appearances of two new villains on the big screen but at this point, I would be curious to see the green goblin return. So overall I would definitely recommend this movie."
"batmite19","7","17","24","17 July 2017"," Not my cup of tea.
","I understand Marvel's desire to get Spider-Man back to his teen-aged roots. However, I think they made him too young. There is a growing trend with superhero movies to focus on the young hero learning to use his powers. They said this wasn't going to be an origin story, and yet is basically was. Young Peter Parker looks to get mentored by an older Iron Man, and has to prove himself worthy of the mantle.<br/><br/>I disliked the totally mechanized suit. Spider-Man never, ever, had a computerized suit in the comics. Why? Because he didn't need one. He was a fully qualified superhero with just his powers, his wits, and his web-shooters.<br/><br/>When the computer started talking to him, it became Iron Man all over again. JARVIS, er Jane (no, that's Ender's computer), er Karen was a distraction. Just totally unnecessary, in my opinion. And all the ""combat"" options, web options, etc. Too much.<br/><br/>I didn't like the Vulture, either. I thought I would flip out over Michael Keaton in the role. But the character written for the film was not what I expected. The Vulture was always a solitary villain, perched on rooftops, swooping in to steal and kill. Now, he's a family man with a bunch of criminal buds.<br/><br/>The first two Raimi films focused on the tension between Peter Parker's best friend having a villainous dad; this time, it just shifted to a love interest.<br/><br/>I thought the best part of the movie was the climax, when Peter had to go up against the Vulture without the suit. He proved that he didn't need it. He was a hero without it. And he made the right decision at the end to turn down Stark's offer.<br/><br/>It would have been the perfect ending if he had opened the bag and found a non-mechanized, traditional spandex spider suit inside. I was so disappointed when it turned out to be the computerized one.<br/><br/>I guess that means more witty banter between Peter and JARVIS, er, Karen in our future."
"OpinionGuy","1","80","135","30 September 2017"," Worst Spidey to Date
","I have seen all the Spiderman movies up to date, and let me tell you, this one was the worst of them all. Disney's marvel send us straight back to those bad cringeworthy kids 90's TV shows. That was full of cheese and unfunny forced jokes with a very thin story line. The only positive thing about the new Spiderman movie is Michael Keaton and Tom Holland. they do a good job in this mess of a movie. But that dont save the movie when over 60 years of what made Spiderman great, gets tossed out. Everything can be summed up in one word: incompetence. If you are a fan of Spiderman do yourself a favor and stay away from this one."
"acekaiba","10","179","318","7 July 2017"," Spider-Man's Legacy
","I must say that, as a Marvel Fan, I am deeply impressed with this new movie. I know that this Spidey is not really in line with the classical comics but I have to admit that this movie has an outstanding story plot. Even the Spiderman's suit, that Tony Stark has made for him, is really impressive with all these high tech features and web combinations and Jennifer Connelly was really talented when she played the A.I. for it (Similar to F.R.I.D.A.Y in the Iron Man suit). Michael Keaton played a BAD-ASS Super-villain and that has scored a lot of points as well. As a huge Iron Man fan, I admired the support and motivation that Stark has given to Peter Parker as an Inspirational and Charismatic Mentor (Hoping that Robert Downey Jr. can win an Oscar for ""Best Supporting Actor"" in this movie). Overall I believe that Tom Holland has played a cool and hip Spider-Man similar to Ryan Reynold's Deadpool except with more comical but juvenile humor. I know that people say that he is too young to play the Spidey role but I think that we should give him a chance to continue to do so since he has produced promising results form this Hollywood Masterpiece. Who knows, he might even stun millions of viewers in the upcoming Avengers Movies. Good Job ;)"
"ejones3157","1","235","423","7 July 2017"," Terrible. Maybe the worst Spider-Man film yet.
","Spider-Man: Homecoming is probably the worst Spider-Man movie yet. I would have to go back and watch the terrible Amazing Spider-Man reboots and compare to really give a definitive answer. <br/><br/>There is so much wrong with this movie that I don't even know where to begin. Sitting in the theater I kept thinking and sighing to myself going ""Man this movie is horrible"". I kept waiting for it to pick up but it never did. <br/><br/>One of the main problems (like I see some have posted on here) is Iron Man. There is absolutely no reason for him to be in this movie to me. I hate that he gave Spider-Man his suit, which is basically a spandex Iron Man suit. Spider-Man or Spider-Boy can't save a ferry boat full of people, Iron Man has to show up and save everyone. We have to watch Spider-Boy whine and complain to his fat annoying friend about Iron Man throughout almost the entire movie. Iron Man is here to substitute Uncle Ben basically and help Spider-Man get back to making money at the box office again.<br/><br/>The characters in the movie are annoying as HELL. Peter's fat annoying friend who is constantly asking him stupid questions. Flash Thompson, who I hope they aren't planing on turning into Venom because the actor they have here is worse than the one from Spider- Man 3. Flash Thompson is weirdly obsessed with Peter, there is a scene where he runs past Peter and slaps him on the ass...you do the math. Mary Jane or MJ or Michelle (I guess she is the new Mary Jane) is a weird, hipster like chick who hates everything and is also weirdly obsessed with Peter. Michael Keaton is cool as the Vulture but they give him little to do really up until the end. Even Spider- Man himself was annoying. <br/><br/>This is a typical MCU movie so you pretty much know what you are going to get. All these different superheros, with different stories and backgrounds to tell and Marvel continues to keep this same, tired and overdone formula they have been using forever. Full of cheesy and unfunny FORCED jokes that are extremely overdone. Somehow critics love this and rate these movies high as if they haven't seen it just a few months ago in Guardians of the Galaxy 2. No memorable action sequences like from Spider-Man 1,2, or even 3. A villain or villains that aren't worth a damn (typical MCU) and a basic story that never really goes anywhere. A twist that even Stevie Wonder could have seen coming. A very weak Spider-Man movie that doesn't get me excited to see the next chapter or even the Spider-Man character anymore because they just can't seem to get him right anymore."

"malcydon","1","60","99","28 July 2017"," Horrible
","I would've give this movie a 5/10, but it's boring. Seriously boring.<br/><br/>First of all, the movie is a generic teenage.. superhero movie. Filled with clich√©s. A lot of clich√©. I really hate that they set Peter Parker as a pretty stupid person. Very stupid, very naive for a 15 yo lad. If you are 15 yo and would not cross any of what he did as stupid, than you have brain damage.<br/><br/>Second, The movie is not faithful to the original work, or what you would expect from a Spider-Man movie. They dropped in some Star tech to basically skip everything, the web-shooting is the same. There is a whole 10 second when he invents the web-fluid. That's it. I understand that it would be boring, but they cut these things and it's even more boring. How?<br/><br/>The camera work is okay for mid budget movie. The director thrown in some special ""camera work"" which is around 2-5 minutes long, and will annoy the hell out of you. Of course it's at the start of the movie.<br/><br/>In the first 20 minutes I almost fallen asleep, I closed my eyes a lot. Half the cinema was sighing and were watching the phone clocks. Which was kind of a... very negative.. feedback. I watched it later on the computer, if I let something out. For internet arguing. But.. this is just not an okay movie. Not even a ""meh"". It's bad.<br/><br/>It's so bad, that the bully is basically a standard Arab guy - that they probably put in for diversity - who calls Peter a genital. A bully used to be a thing, and it used to be a muscular aggressive man, that hit and kicked Peter. A real bully. Realistic. Now.. it's just.. a guy.. It's very shameful.<br/><br/>I really don't recommend it."

"starlimitz2","10","160","283","9 July 2017"," Go watch it, Webheads!
","Finally! The movie that Spider-man truly deserves. While other Spider-man movies have plenty of merit (and others don't), Homecoming is by far the greatest rendition of Spider-man movies ever created for the silver screen! It had everything that encompasses Spider-man, but in smaller doses so that they are easier to digest and enjoy. <br/><br/>The inside jokes came at a great pace, and the comedy traveled far and wide for all kinds of humor. Even the darker humor was not too dark, and still suited Spider-man to a T. Tom Holland was great with his reactions to the humor going on around him, while also giving off his own jokes the way a spider can. His friend, Ned was not over done, he was given, once again, in small doses, and never got annoying, which is really hard for a comic relief character. The only thing I think they could have really done without was Flash. While Flash Thompson was good for a few laughs, he just didn't contribute a whole lot to the overall quality of the film itself. That, however, is the tiniest of nitpicks, and does not at all affect its score.<br/><br/>It gets triumphant echoes of joy with the action scenes. They are fast pace, high octane, and show that Spider-man has a lot to learn before he reaches his prime. You truly feel like this is how Spider- man would act were he put into these situations. He gets his butt kicked as much as he kicks tail himself, but that's more from his inexperience, and again, it is not shoved into your face, it is delivered in a moderate quantity for maximum efficiency. <br/><br/>Characters have their roles, and all of them play them off to their utmost and pull their own weight. The character Michelle is a quiet giant in her field of comedy, and is one of the funniest characters in her own rite. Michael Keaton as the Vulture is fantastic! He is not really evil, he has his own motivations, they just happen to be outside of the law. Peter's crush, Liz, plays a far bigger role than expected, but a necessary one in the long run. The moment we are introduced to her, I figured she may be the thorn in the movie's side, but, once again, small doses prevail.<br/><br/>The story is rather small potatoes in the spectrum of the M.C.U., but that is perfect for a beginner super hero movie, which is where Suicide Squad's biggest failure can be observed. Homecoming stays within its bounds, and is as big as it needs to be for when it needs it the most. <br/><br/>Flaws in this movie are hard to find, beyond nitpicking it to death (which some will, it's inevitable). It is more than welcome in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and is a must-own for hardcore fans and casual fans of Spider-man (and Marvel) alike. Do not miss this movie, it is well worth the full price of admission, even if it is the 3-D price! Yes! It is that good! Now stop reading this review and go watch it, Web heads!!!"

","You will enjoy every single minute of this movie, Tom Holland is definitely the best peter Parker and Spider-Man we have ever seen. Marvel studios really did deliver with this one great action, humor, comedy, and much more. The villain in this movie who is the vulture is probably the best marvel movie villain ever, Michael Keaton gives his best portrayal of the role. This is not a iron man movie this is a straight Spider-Man movie that tells us his life before and after civil war and it all sums up very good."

","I've read a few reviews and I understood a few complaints especially if you were a 90s kid and haven't been keeping up with all the reboots and whatnot of Spiderman. Toby's Spiderman in 2002 was more of ""Spiderman the animated series"" version of the 90s. If you only remember that spider-man this movie could be kind of disappointing. Me on the other hand, I've been keeping up with all my superheroes that interest me, with spider-man being my favorite, I've been watching the Ultimate Spiderman. He crosses over with the avengers a few episodes, even gets invited to join the avengers down like he was in the movie and turned it down. In the cartoon, Shield gives him all of his gadgets and Iron man gives him this Iron man Spider suit. In the movie, Tony stark is responsible for all of his gadgets. The story is a little different but it works for me. I enjoyed watching the spider-man who actually is a kid unlike other spider-man movies. I expected more from this movie but it still was a 10 out of 10. I think that this movie sets up the next spider-man movie and even sets up the avengers movie maybe. The one thing i probably felt was just totally wrong in this movie is the portrayal of flash Thompson. That was very disappointing. Where is the not so smart High school Jock, not this guy that is supposedly one of the fastest in the school (athleticism) but is on a debate team?? GTFOH. only disappointment."

","Honestly, when the movie was announced I really did think that this would've ruined the classic Spiderman franchise, seems that I was wrong. This is an absolutely 'amazing' movie, best Spiderman movie yet! Although actors have changed, this time the Avengers recognise this young man as a hero and they also add a story to it, the classic Spiderman trying to stop the train with the tensile strength of his webs was recreated in the movie and many of the original features were retained. There is also a very funny sense of humour (personally) and I honestly found it hilarious. They could not choose anyone better than Ned as Spidey's best friend and I would rate this movie an excellent 9.6 out of 10!"

","FINALLY!!!! This is the version of Spider-Man that I've been waiting YEARS for. Tom Holland nails both Peter Parker, and Spider-Man so perfectly, giving each of them a distinct personality. Robert Downey Jr. is used sparingly and never intrudes on Spider- Man's movie and even feels like a father figure at some points. Michael Keaton KILLS as the Vulture and gives Marvel one of its greatest villains to date. Everyone else gives there A-game in Marvel's top 5 best movies to date. Yes, there are some jokes that don't land and yes, this does feel like a John Hughes movie with Spider-Man perfectly stuffed in rather than a super-hero movie, but writing is perfect, the story is AMAZING (wink, wink), and overall, it's a well directed, well made movie. Everyone involved should be proud of themselves. So in all, watch it, then watch it again. SIDE NOTE/SPOILER: STAY TIL THE END OF THE CREDITS IF YOU WANT MARVEL TO GIVE YOU THE FINGER. WORTH IT."
"ktdet","10","122","213","15 July 2017"," Watch Spiderman Homecoming You Review
","Watch Spiderman Homecoming You Review<br/><br/>love this movie. Best movie how Young Peter Parker Started out. <br/><br/>Spider-Man for the past 15 years. First there was Tobey Maguire, who under the direction of Sam Raimi for three films ushered in the modern superhero era, and then there was Andrew Garfield whose two films with Marc Webb were immediately forgettable. And now, like all obedient franchises, they're trying to start all over again, this time with the much more age-appropriate Tom Holland in ""Spider-Man: Homecoming.""<br/><br/>And you know what? Superhero cynicism aside, ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" is really fun. Director Jon Watts, whose only previous feature film credit is the indie thriller ""Cop Car,"" has confidently put his stamp on the friendly neighborhood web slinger by making one bold move: actually casting teenagers to play teenagers.<br/><br/>Yes, after two films with late 20-somethings donning the Spidey suit and getting bitten by that pesky spider, Spider-Man finally gets to be a kid (and we get to skip over the whole origin/ Uncle Ben story). Instead, Watts' film, which is upsettingly credited to six screenwriters, picks up with Peter Parker (Holland) right before, during and after the events of ""Captain America: Civil War,"" which introduced Holland's Spider-Man in that epic airport Avengers battle.<br/><br/>Instead of a ""last week in Marvel"" segment to catch up, we're given a refresher via Peter's perspective. He's just an excited kid who filmed the whole adventure and ever since has been thirsting for more Avengers action. He tries, endearingly, to prove his mettle on his own as he waits idly in Queens for a call from Tony Stark ‚Äî giving directions to the elderly, retrieving stolen bikes and doing flips on command.<br/><br/>What he doesn't know is that for eight years, there has been a supervillain emerging in his town in the form of a wronged construction worker, Adrian (Michael Keaton), who decided to break bad after losing a job to a government crew that clears post- superhero fight disaster areas. Peter, with his true-blue heart and naivete and eagerness to prove himself, of course takes on more than he can handle, while also trying to navigate high school, homework, crushes and the awkwardness of just being a teenager. Time passes easily and just when you might worry that you don't actually care about any of the characters, the story throws a great curveball that carries interest to the end.<br/><br/>The film is overflowing with stellar talent, even in the smallest of roles and not counting the Marvel loaners in Robert Downey Jr. (who oozes charisma and charm even when phoning it in for a handful of scenes) and Jon Favreau. In the high school alone, there's the too- cool Michelle (Zendaya), the crush Liz (Laura Harrier) and the adorable breakout best friend Ned (Jacob Batalon). Hannibal Buress and Martin Starr are there, too, to add reliable laughs. Adrian's bad-guy crew includes Logan Marshall-Green and Michael Cernus. Even Spider-Man's suit has an Oscar winner behind its voice (Jennifer Connelly).<br/><br/>Then of course there is Holland, a terrific actor since ""The Impossible,"" who is the perfect amount of empathetic, excitable and clueless to make Peter Parker work now and for years to come. For the most part, ""Homecoming"" is a joy. It's light-hearted, smart, a little meta and the first Marvel film to really consider what it might be like for kids living in a world where superheroes are real.<br/><br/>My only quibble with ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" is that for all of its charming and infectious realism about race, high school life and class issues, it has a bit of a woman problem. Simply: every significant and semi-significant female character looks like a model. It wouldn't be an issue of the film not so spot-on with casting such a realistic variety of men and teenage boys, or if it were less concerned with hammering down on the ""Aunt May is hot"" bit that goes a little too far, but when taken together you start to wonder if maybe things would have been different if just one of the six screenwriters was a woman. But just as Peter has some growing up to do, so does this young franchise."
"pyrocitor","10","117","204","15 July 2017"," Welcome home, web-head
","Spider-Fans are a thick-skinned lot. And, in watching his attempts to crawl onto the big screen, we've taken some gut-punches. From the early, fun-but-twee Sam Raimi days to the murky, Marc Webb hipster days (to say nothing of the nightmare of 'Dancing Emo Peter' - a farce of idiocy the character will be lucky to ever shrug off), we've watched our boy take more beats than a bout with Doctor Octopus. So, even finally(!) reacquainted with his REAL parents - a Marvellous accomplishment in itself - dare we hope? In the face of so much misguided corporate overreach, hackneyed tonal imbalance, flagrant disregard for comic backstory, and (shudder) hip-thrusts, dare we dream the dream of a half-decent cinematic Spider-Man, for the first time in more than some viewers' lifetimes? <br/><br/>Rest easy, true believers: Homecoming is the best Spider-Man movie ever made. <br/><br/>Right from the playful strains of a certain familiar theme over the opening logos, it's immediately apparent that Marvel Studios have not treated the reacquisition of their most beloved character lightly. Director Jon Watts' film practically leaps off the screen with a bouncy, mischievous energy, snappy humour, and such a sheer outpouring of joy at its own existence (no tired teen angst here!) that it's nigh impossible to resist grinning from start to finish. In contrast to the increasingly cosmic Marvel Cinematic Universe growing around it, Homecoming is winningly small and intimate: not only does Watts paint a love letter to the rough and tumble charm of Queens and its inhabitants, but the film's stakes are not the fate of the world or universe, but, appropriately, the neighbourhood becoming less friendly. <br/><br/>It's a hugely welcome tonic to blockbuster bloat, and the rare summer romp with space for characters to breathe. Watts channels Parker's bustling eagerness for a higher calling into one of the most organic, truthful depictions of a modern high school, with a John Hughes ear for its stresses, infantilization, and small joys. One sequence, where Peter wrestles with the ethics of crashing a party as Spider-Man to raise his social standing to help bag a date to the titular dance, is so adorably true to the character it's hard not to shed a tear in gratitude. It's telling that we know and care more about Parker's high school classmates than many of the B-tier, celebrity-cast superheroes in the MCU, and Laura Harrier, Zendaya, Tony Revolori (whose Flash, while no longer a jock, hits terribly credible cringeworthy notes of modern bullying), and especially Jacob Batalon (who sells many of the film's comedic and emotional beats with surprisingly hilarious aplomb) flesh them out superbly. Paradoxically, the film's grounded aesthetic also helps blend it into the MCU much more seamlessly than many of its cohort, reframing the MCU's macro conflicts through a nonplussed ground level (upon an exquisitely tongue-in-cheek Chris Evans cameo, Parker's teacher deadpans ""or maybe he's a war criminal now. I dunno""), while the House of Mouse cheerfully works in Star Wars swag at every turn. <br/><br/>But, in the midst of this uncharacteristically unassuming 'world-building,' for Marvel, the fun and thrills have not been left crammed into a locker. Watts' action interludes are fizzy, raucous, clumsy (one car chase has Peter destroying - and chatting with - most of Queens in his inexperienced tenacity), and just as exhilarating as any of the bigger, brawnier Marvel counterparts. If anything, Watts infuses his blowouts with such worry Peter is in way over his head (his heroic intervention to the crumbling Washington Monument is interrupted by a panic attack from the altitude), that emotions are unprecedentedly ratcheted up for superhero combat. Even initial concerns of Spider-Man being too governed by Stark tech melt away in the face of Parker's unquenchable enthusiasm in the face of his costume's wacky potential, as his stacked super-suit cues many of the film's biggest laughs (two words: 'Intimidation Mode'), while Michael Giacchino's twinkling score soars and lilts with the quintessence of Spider-Man. <br/><br/>Michael Keaton's Vulture is unexpectedly terrifying, adding a uniquely aerodynamic to keep their tussles fresh and thrilling. Keaton's idiosyncratic, bristling, and grimly heartfelt performance (a righteously indignant 'working class hero' antithesis to Tony Stark) takes what could have been another bland, disposable villain and makes him one of the most deceptively memorable and compelling of the MCU. There are the slightest wobbles in the web - the Shocker is fun but a touch underwhelming for such a cult classic Spider-foe, while Donald Glover's cameo is amusing but superfluous. But in the face of the film's relentless outpouring of fun and heart, including a third act twist as astonishingly unexpected as it is retroactively self- evident, they are less than inconsequential. And there is one sequence, ripped from the comic pages of the Lee/Ditko days, that is almost overwhelmingly emotional, anchoring the core 'tireless underdog' ethos of Spider-Man in tearfully perfect fashion. <br/><br/>And Tom Holland. Dear Tom Holland. To call his impish, earnest charisma perfect for Peter Parker would be an understatement - he's almost achingly affable and human in and out of homespun or high tech costume, with a flair for pitch-perfect Spider-quips, raw vulnerability, and self-reproachful asides that are almost too lovable for words. In short, he is Spider-Man through-and-through. Supporting him, Robert Downey Jr. continues to find unexplored wrinkles in his eighth time embodying Tony Stark, and his clumsy 'Uncle Tony' mentoring (""my dad was never there for me, so, uh, breaking the cycle of shame"") is hugely amusing without overstaying his welcome. Marisa Tomei is too effervescently delightedly not to larb as Aunt May (now with more charm and less life lessons! Yay!), while Jon Favreau is reliably hilarious as the crusty Happy Hogan. <br/><br/>Homecoming doesn't just do whatever a spider can - it redefines Spider-Man while showing unprecedented care and affection for what makes the character tick, all while teeming with humour, heart, humanity, and infectious fun. Soak it in, Spider-Friends. He's home. <br/><br/>-9.5/10"

Words that inspire that are beautiful that make me want to laugh or cry. I know all the stuff they put into this movie already and a retelling isn't bad but you have to tell it well. Really? Ironman gives Spidey his suit? No he does not and never did. No. If you want to adapt a Spider-Man story for the big screen then you should attempt J. Micheal Strazynski's work with this character. If you don't like that then make it fun. At the very least make 80% of the movie about Spidey flying thru the air and shooting stuff with his webbing. Crawling up and over and under stuff. Show me what the technology can do. Give me a spiders perspective. I can't recommend this movie. I can't recommend any of them. Spider-Man has to live with the fact he made a wrong choice and someone died because of it. When he got his powers he used them to make a quick buck, easy money. In this day and age that's more pertinent then ever.

This spiderman is a loser that no one can depend on and the same goes for peter parker. All this guy did was get bit by a radioactive spider and really is nothing without the suit that Tony Stark made for him. Homecoming? Again lol. Plus she was peter's date. That is all they were never really boyfriend and girlfriend. This had to be said because when peter was fighting vulture guy, Peter was like ""fighting your girlfriend's dad during the homecoming night"". Also dare I say, Peter is bad news to all his girlfriends or love interests. <br/><br/>Only the cameos and the link to the marvel universe is what redeems it. The almost use of the F-word twice was kinda funny I suppose. In the end when Captain America says the key to a great superhero is patience and something about being disappointed.

","I CAN NOT and WILL NO LONGER believe that these reviews are impartial. This movie is a joke - and the joke is played upon the viewer. The Plot - if you can call it a plot - is so thin that any FX (No matter how 'cool') are just pure irrelevance. Don't get me wrong... the kid playing Spider-Man - 'Tom Holland' - does a fine job - the supporting Actors (Most of greater fame / experience and talent) also do theirs. The problem is... the PLOT - which, as stated above, is so clich√©'d as to be worthless. Keaton does his usual ham-fisted approach to acting (perhaps I should have put 'ham' in uppercase). Robert Downey Jr. is his usual blas√© self (Obviously - he'd already been paid). To waste Marisa Tomeis' skills is just an insult, not to mention Jon Favreau and Gwyneth Paltrows' undoubted talent. The very fact that this movie received a 7.8 star rating is enough to show that rigging is in process. I'd go through the plot - bit by bit - to try and get across my dismay at the so-called acclaim this piece of excrement received but I wouldn't want to waste 2 and a half minutes of your time - because, truly, that's about the length this movie should have been."

"spiderhonaker","1","180","324","7 July 2017"," Does Whatever A Spider Can't?
","From someone who has followed the adventures of the webslinger for decades, I believe that this may just be the worst Spider-Man movie ever made. It takes an established character who has over 60 years of history to draw from and tosses out everything that makes Spider-Man...well...Spider-Man.<br/><br/>Everything about this characterization can be summed up in one word: incompetence. This goes beyond bumbling or stumbling due to growing pains - this is a Spider-Man that can't seem to remember that he is freakin' Spider-Man! For example, when climbing to the top of the Washington Memorial, he suddenly becomes intimidated by the height that he standing at. Consider that for a moment - Spider-Man scared of heights! Isn't his most famous power the fact that he climbs and swings between tall buildings? Considering that there are over 100 buildings in NYC taller than the monument, surely he's been this high before.<br/><br/>I don't think he actually wins a single fight in this movie as well. If not for the interference of others (or their mercy), he would have lost every time. In fact, he doesn't actually beat the main villain at the end of the movie! If not for the fact that the Vulture decides to grab a crate of tech (that explodes) rather than finishing him off, then the villain wins and the hero is destroyed.<br/><br/>Tons of other internal inconsistencies abound - he's strong enough to catch cars but he can't punch through glass - he knocks himself out by jumping into the top of a tractor trailer but can have an entire building dumped on him without injury, etc.<br/><br/>He also lacks any concern whatsoever for protecting his identity - a problem with every Spider-Man movie before this to be sure - but here it is taken to new heights. By the end of the film, we have 6 individuals who know who Peter Parker is including the villain who figures it out within the length of a car ride. Not surprising considering he and his friend are always casually discussing it in the middle of crowded school hallways and cafeterias.<br/><br/>If you love the source material (comics), then do not watch this film. It will give you bleeding ulcers."

"peterbrianboss","4","41","66","18 July 2017"," ""It's Marvel so it's probably good""
","I went into this movie thinking it's probably going to be good despite the trailers looking garbage. I figured that it's Marvel so it'll probably be good. This character showed up in Civil War, a Marvel film I really loved. There will be the normal forced Marvel jokes that plagued Doctor Strange but, like Doctor Strange, I'll look past the few awkward jokes and still enjoy the movie as a whole. Well, Spider-Man Homecoming is one of my least favourite Marvel movies.<br/><br/>I know people really dig this movie but I just can't. The way Spider-Man looks is inexcusable as he's jumping around like a cartoon in the most boring web slinging they've ever put to screen. I guess the other movies did it so this one had to ignore it despite it being a great opportunity for some great visuals. Anyway, the CGI was terrible for basically all of the scenes with Spider-man in this Tony Stark suit. He looks like he just isn't there. I know that he didn't look that great in Civil War either but I figured that them not having a suit on set was them trying to keep it a secret or something, I don't know, at very least they should have learnt from their mistake while he was a minor character rather than repeat it in a full length spider- man movie. I don't know how they did it or whether or not CGI was the problem but either way it looked really bad. A Marvel movie should do better. Also that scene of Tony Stark talking to Spider-Man on the building looked horrible. It looked like a bad green screen effect but surely they could get that right, so many other movies nowadays have. Whatever, enough about how the movie looked.<br/><br/>There are things I liked about this movie. I think Robert Downey jr and Tom Holland did great jokes playing their characters and the interactions they had where cool to see. The main thing I really liked about this movie was Michael Keaton's vulture. The movie was really good from the twist all the way to the end of the big end fight. There were less dumb, forced jokes (although Peter Parkers 'computer guy' still had some jokey moments in these scenes) and it was legitimately tense. If it wasn't for this section of the movie I'd have hated it so much more than I did. But then there was everything that followed.<br/><br/>Forced jokes. So many awkward, long, crap jokes. One was literally a poop joke with a toilet flush. Every scene at the very end of this movie was terrible. From the forced and confusing 'MJ' reference to the 'that was a test, right?' line which ruined the moral of the story and the very ending of the movie was just another lame joke ruining what could have been a great moment. The fact that a villain saved this movie for me is something I never thought would happen in a Marvel film. I used the word 'saved' loosely though. I don't want Marvel to keep going down this path of awkward jokes over substance but I'm just some random guy. Everyone loves this so good for them. I've got to play critic and pretend my voice matters though so 4/10."

","Perhaps the best spider-man movie yet. No doubt, Holland did a great job portraying the character. We get to see the life of Peter Parker as an actual high school kid and how he deals with all the responsibilities and be spider-man at the same time. It is a must watch movie, whether you are a comic book reader, spider-man fan or simply a good movie lover. We get to see Vulture for the first time on screen and he really challenges Peter to sacrifice for the greater good. Hands down, one of the best movie ever made."

","Spider-Man: Homecoming continues with the adventures of Peter Parker/Spider-Man(Tom Holland), following the events of Captain America: Civil War(2016). Peter juggles his high school life & his crime fighting life, as Spider-Man. He has help from Tony Stark/Iron Man(Robert Downey Jr.). Peter's life gets complicated when Spider- Man faces his most formidable adversary yet, Adrian Toomes/Vulture(Michael Keaton). Now, it is up to Spider-Man to stop the Vulture, before it's too late. <br/><br/>Spider-Man: Homecoming is a spectacular film. It is the best Spider- Man movie, yet. Director Jon Watts makes sure that the audience sees a different side of Spider-Man, that wasn't seen in any of the previous big screen incarnations of the character. I love the fact that the focus was on Peter Parker's high school life, this time around. The action set pieces are awe-inspiring. The Washington Monument scene, the Staten Island ferry scene & the climax are the highlights of the film. The visual effects are mind blowing. The 3D is eye-popping. I love the fact that we get to see Spidey's iconic red & blue suit from the comics, complete with the web glider & expressive eye visors. The background score by Michael Giacchino sticks with you, long after the film ends. The performances make the movie, flawless. Tom Holland is the star of the show, as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Holland portrays Peter Parker's awkwardness & vulnerability & Spider-Man's wit & flexibility, with ease & panache. Michael Keaton is outstanding as Adrian Toomes/Vulture. Keaton's Vulture is the best villain in all six standalone Spider-Man movies, along with Willem Dafoe's portrayal of Green Goblin/Norman Osborn. Robert Downey Jr. is great as Tony Stark/Iron Man. Marisa Tomei is brilliant as May Parker. Jon Favreau is superb as Happy Hogan. Zendaya is awesome as Michelle. Jacob Batalon is fantastic as Ned. Laura Harrier is excellent as Liz. Tony Revolori is hilarious as Flash. Donald Glover, Bokeem Woodbine, Hannibal Buress, Kenneth Choi, Martin Starr, Michael Chernus, Michael Mando, Logan Marshall-Green & Jennifer Connelly are good as, Aaron Davis, Herman Schultz/Shocker #2, Coach Wilson, Principal Morita, Mr. Harrington, Phineas Mason/The Tinkerer, Mac Gargan, Jackson Brice/Shocker #1 & Karen/Suit Lady, respectively. The Marvel Cinematic Universe can do no wrong. I can't wait for Spidey's return, in Avengers: Infinity War(2018). Spider-Man: Homecoming is a must watch, for everyone. Swing by your favorite theater, immediately!"

","My real rating for this movie is 3 stars, but since it has a rating of 7.7 as of writing these lines, I feel it's my moral duty to lower the average as much as I can.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a decent humor clad movie, but it's mere existence is a troubling progression in an ongoing factory of the ruining of our childhood heroes for the occasional buck.<br/><br/>So the occasional jokes are funny and the sidekick character is hella cute, but all these aren't a movie make. What is lacking is a reason why I, aka the viewer, should give a damn about what is going on. A movie is supposed to take you on a ride, to meet and accompany a character or a group in a journey that is meaningful in a way to them, experience the emotions through them. This feat is achieved by good writing and directing, a wholesome and insightful crafting of a story.<br/><br/>Spiderman:homecoming is like a jigsaw of gimmicks that have been rearranged by an eager toddler to make a colorful but oh so wrong picture, at the expense of our friendly neighborhood spidy."
"mukool-hastak","10","138","246","7 July 2017"," Breath of fresh air for Spiderman movies, for the MCU and for superhero movies in general !
","Opening Arguments: Till Dr Strange came out, the MCU had become rather formulaic in terms of character development and plot lines. Colourful action sequences, an ensemble of great actors and a few comical tropes thrown in here and there to make the plot lines seem clever and grounded are some factors that were causing MCU movies to become hit after hit. However, it wouldn't work forever and something had to change. And, boy, did it change with Spiderman Homecoming !! Usually i am wary to call a superhero movie 'realistic', but i will use that particular term in this movie simply because the entire movie is welded together in a seamless stream of events that play out very sensibly inside the viewers head.<br/><br/>Plot: 'Stay close to the ground', Stark tells Peter. And the movie does so too. The result is a very believable version of how a 15 year old boy on the cusp of becoming an Avenger, but also struggling with 'coming of age' issues would behave. Yes there are a couple of good action set pieces. But even those are portrayed so well that they seem to be stem more out of a series of events going out of hand rather than the movie setting us up for action just for the heck of it. And each act blends into the other in a fluid way that has been missing in superhero movies so far.<br/><br/>Acting & Characters: Absolutely full marks to Holland and Keaton. After a long long time do we get to enjoy a fully fleshed out antagonist in the MCU! When i watched the trailers i thought 'The Vulture' is going to be another mech-suit wearing bad guy drunk on power and carnage. But no. Keaton's character actually keeps developing & evolving throughout the span of the movie so well that a discerning viewer might even question whether he is really so much of a bad guy at all. And Holland, well, you can just see that he gives his heart & soul to this performance, and i am looking forward to see more of him in future MCU movies. If he is truly the central character of phase 4, then the MCU is in good hands.<br/><br/>Other stuff: It actually feels nice to see Peter getting used to a wicked tech-ed up suit developed by Stark which is part of why this movie feels fresh. Rather than giving 'instinct' as an excuse for all the cool stuff spiderman can do, here we are given a version of how Spidey first learns many tricks with the help of some cool Stark tech, but then also learns to look inside of himself for the best of his abilities after his suit is temporarily taken away by an angry Tony after the ferry incident depicted in the trailers.<br/><br/>Closing arguments: Overall, the movie offers everything: a grounded plot, great characters to sympathise with, well placed yet simplistic humour and of course, cool Spidey stuff !! Spiderman comes of age and so does the MCU itself. Previous versions haven't made it beyond 3 and 2 movies respectively. Maybe the third-time reboot's a charm ? :-)"

","This Spider-Man can't do a lot a things right. The character in Avengers slugfest seems to have things together fighting wise. In this movie he can't do anything right, does not seem smart enough to figure out the most obvious of answers to a problem, pines after Tony Stark for most of the movie, and falls down constantly like balance really is not his best attribute. Forget any spider sense, he does not have any.<br/><br/>He basically has no self identity, but somehow magically finds it at the very end of the movie. This is not Peter Parker, but rather an extremely bad rendition of one meant to appeal to the younger crowd. Tom Holland also has the wrong voice, just does not carry any weight when he speaks Honestly the most memorable character for the right reasons was Michelle (MJ) played by Zendaya.<br/><br/>The ""love"" interest was not all that interesting, Micheal Keaton was good, but his role was underused and ended up feeling rather flat as a bad guy. Marisa Tomei is horribly miscast as Aunt May (one good scene from her). Peter Parker's buddy is just annoying at some point and has no brains either. Tony Stark appeared way too much for this to actually be called a Spider-Man movie.<br/><br/>An very forgettable movie and will not end up on my shelf.<br/><br/>Technical details: Special effects for Spider-Man were not the best.

","Don't expect a superhero movie. This is more like a long comedic sketch parodying Spider-man.<br/><br/>There are so many wrongs in this movie I 've lost count., but most importantly the vision is wrong. I would prefer Raimi/McGuire's vision by far.<br/><br/>Among other things this reboot is missing the transformation from regular Peter Parker to Spiderman. The most interesting thing to the franchise to watch. And of course his relation with his uncle (who doesn't get a single mention in this film) and how his tragic fate was quintessential to his maturity.<br/><br/>They are still trying to show you the transition from a goofy kiddy Spiderman to something more adult but they are failing miserably, because even in the end the character hasn't mature at all.<br/><br/>And it's that ""goofy"" version of Spiderman that ruins this movie, as a superhero movie. There aren't any real sentiments at all. Just teenage humor and pranks. And the final revelation and connection between Spiderman and the main villain is too ludicrous to swallow.<br/><br/>For its $175 mil. budget this movie is far from impressive too. Not a big spectacle. All that money went for the CGI Spidey jumping back and forth, but the scenes aren't that impressive and there's a lot to be desired.<br/><br/>Overall: This movie is already a success in Box office multiplying the earnings more than 4 times its budget, so the producers must be happy. BUT it's more like a spoof of Spiderman and not a proper superhero movie. For the true origins of Spiderman, his transformation, his relation with his uncle and the impact of his tragic fate on Peter, you must look elsewhere..."

","Honestly, getting someone to review this movie who has no understanding (from reading the review) of everything that went into making this movie, and what this movie actually has to offer is sad and a detriment to this movie by expressing opinions of something that the reviewer has no proper knowledge of. <br/><br/>Firstly you ask what went wrong for a reboot to be made. The Amazing Spider-Man is what was wrong, the mediocre pieced together story with a dark and depressing premise for a character that's meant to be light hearted, goofy and young. Getting a 30 year old Actor of Andrew Garfield to portray a young Peter Parker didn't gel at all.<br/><br/>Secondly Sony didn't want to continue with Andrew Garfield after the 2nd Spiderman movie and due to the licensing rights Sony made with Marvel (pre Disney Ownership) they have to make a Spiderman movie within so many years or they lose the rights which then go back to Marvel, now owned by Disney. <br/><br/>What transpired from this was Amy Pascal from Sony and Kevin Feige from Marvel coming to agreement as quoted ""Sony has the rights, that's not changing. Have Sony pay for the movie, distribute the movie, market the movie. Just let us make the movie and incorporate him into our universe."" and in doing so a reboot of Spiderman was born. I see no issue with this due to Marvels success so far with their franchise. Marvel gets the rights to all Spiderman Merchandise which they will make quite a bit of money on, also using Spiderman in their movies in which they keep the profits, and also Spiderman Homecoming 2 (probably not the name) will lead the MCU into Phase 4, which shows the commitment and investment from both sides to make this work. <br/><br/>In doing this Spiderman has a great mesh with the Marvel universe, and what comic book fans and Spiderman fans have always wanted since the The Amazing Spider-Man reboot wasn't that well received. In this movie there are so many Easter Eggs, from mention of Miles Morales ( Black/Latino Spiderman), brief showing of a possible Villain in Scorpion. The showing of the Prowler, Shocker, The Tinkerer and references to previous Marvel films. <br/><br/>If you wanted to go into this movie expecting a full on action and story-less movie and lots of spider-man flying through the city and saving the world, then you wont get this here. What will you get though is a great introduction to a character of Spider-man showing his true self as portrayed by the comic books, but not told the same old way, a fresh and dynamic approach to creating the character making us feel for the character, and showing that Spider-man doesn't have to save the world but still can make a difference and save the day even if the stakes aren't that high. <br/><br/>All in all I feel this movie has to be watched more than once to truly see and understand how brilliant a director Jon Watts is, and how he made a perfect comic book movie."

"EdShankle","5","40","66","19 July 2017"," Too safe and lacking substance
","The first Spider-Man movie is dated for sure, but it has one scene that makes it stand above any of the recent attempts. Remember that final fight between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin? It's pretty damn brutal, Spider-Man gets beat up badly and we are unsure whether he can even survive the fight. <br/><br/>Homecoming has no such scene like this. In fact, the final fight is very underwhelming and really has no tension. Sure, Spider-Man gets beat up a bit, but it's hardly a great 1v1 fight. What makes it terrible is the scene ends with Vulture just forgetting about Spider-Man to go pick up a crate and he blows up in the process. It's a really lame ending.<br/><br/>I think what makes the first two films so good is that Sam Raimi brought his own unique style to the films (his horror influence really shows in the Spider-Man 2 hospital scene where everyone is murdered). He's also better at directing action scenes. <br/><br/>We all remember the train sequence from Spider-Man 2. Spider-Man must use all his strength to stop the train and he reveals his identity in doing so. It's a very suspenseful, powerful scene and a strong character moment as well.<br/><br/>If I could use one word to describe Homecoming it would be this: bland. The ferry scene had potential to be intense, but ended too quickly and was wrapped up by Iron Man saving the day. <br/><br/>The supporting characters aren't that great as well. Ned is decent but mostly there for comedic effect. The bully character, Flash, is probably the most unconvincing bully I've seen in a movie. The love interest, Liz, is incredibly boring and I did not care for her at all. Same goes for Aunt May.<br/><br/>And there's really no powerful character moments in the movie. Nothing like from Spider-Man 2 when Peter tells the truth about Uncle Ben to Aunt May. Or when Harry finds out who killed his father.<br/><br/>To be fair Homecoming does have a good twist near the end, but since it's related to the already boring love interest, I didn't really care much.<br/><br/>What I did like about this movie was Michael Keaton as the villain. He has a good motive for the things he does and the design of his suit is badass. I should also mention that Tom Holland is a pretty good fit as both Peter Parker and Spider-Man. <br/><br/>But the whole film is just too safe to be memorable. I understand that this is the first movie in the series, but it's also the fourth attempt since Spider-Man 2 to give us something great. And when an action scene from 2002 is better than anything in this movie, you know something's wrong. Even things like the music isn't nearly as good. Almost makes me wish for the original crew to get back together and redeem themselves with Spider-Man 4."

The characters are interesting, even the annoying Flash...maybe...moving on, Tom Holland was born to wear the title Spider-Man, even tough I liked Tobie Maguire's take on the characters and Andrew's Garfield as well, in just one movie Tom Holland have already stand out in an amazing way, since Civil War, actually, but I waited for his own movie to get an actual and reliable source to spoke my opinion. <br/><br/>I hope Marvel build an awesome Spider-Man Universe, because they already started very well, they got so many material, and the right people to get that done, so I can only wish the best and wait for the second installment to amaze me as well, hopefully even more, and I know it will."

If you're young, silly, bumbling, inexperienced & incompetent & haven't read the comics, you may be entertained by this, even like it. I noticed the grade on IMDB is dropping fast. Rightfully so. Whose idea was it to have Tom Holland panting & breathing heavy during most scenes when he had to exert some effort? Boy is out of shape. I had heard Michael Keaton gave a great performance.

","Spider-Man Homecoming is a great Spider-Man movie and a great MCU movie and a great movie in general. I like how they made this film more of a teen comedy, it really works well. Tom Holland is not only a great Spider-Man but also a great Peter Parker. Tobey Maguire was a great Peter Parker but not a great Spider-Man. Andrew Garfield was a great Spider-Man but not a great Peter Parker. But Tom Holland is both. Vulture is also a great villain as well. One of my nitpicks with the film is that the spidey sense doesn't seem to be present. And it can be a bit predictable at times as well. Overall Spider-Man Homecoming is a great Spider-Man film and a great MCU film."

I understand that it's all about money and Hollywood knows what sells. Tobey Maguire was excellent and so was Andrew Garfield. Tom is a good actor and he is convincing as Spider-Man.

"JasonR77","10","270","513","9 July 2017"," Best Spidey to Date
","Spider-Man, at his core, is the original kid superhero. His innocence and naivete are as important as his intellect and wit. After two previous incarnations and five movies, it's this version that finally puts together a truly faithful portrayal of Peter Parker. Fittingly, it took the MCU to do it. Tom Holland eschews the portrayals of his predecessors, and infuses Parker with a genuinely optimistic view of the world, and almost a boy crush on Tony Stark. Peter is awkward, nervous and ambitious, to the point where he nearly wrecks himself in order to show Stark how useful he can be. There is a lot of fun to be had in this movie, be it through Spidey's quips, his amusing interactions with people, or just times where he falls flat while trying to be this great superhero. Peter's classmates get a fair bit more work; this is the most complete Flash ever put to film, and Ned is a perfect best friend for Peter. It's a fast movie as well, and Michael Keaton helps keep that going as the counterbalance, his career renaissance continuing in excellent fashion. Vulture is not the most headline-grabbing Spidey villain, certainly, but neither was Obediah Stane for Iron Man, nor Abomination for Hulk. They worked well because of who portrayed them, and this is another case of that working in the favor of the story. Keaton's motivations are simple, but not the same as a typical villain, which makes him stand out, and potentially shows that the MCU can create guys who are more than one-trick ponies. This movie paces itself well, and just when you think it's safe, it pulls a sharp right on you to bring the final act into focus. There's just enough Tony Stark to bolster the bottom line, without having him take over the film. He's the dad, such as it is, who'd have thought? Iron Man is the interweaving thread in this universe, so it's appropriate he be here, and the aforementioned dad role is amusing and in a way the perfect method to bring Spidey along. Overall, a great time. The stakes aren't as high as they're going to be or have been in MCU movies, but that's okay. Spidey just needs to keep his feet on the ground."

Michael Keaton makes a amazing transition from DC to Marvel, as he goes from playing Batman to the Vulture. The cherry on top is Laura Harrier, whom I think has a great future ahead of her. She is my favorite Spider-Man love interest. Gwen was good, but not fulfilled enough, Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) was just the worst. But Liz Allan is my favorite.

","This movie was great in so many aspects. Not only because of the consistency with the comics, but also because it clearly showed us how Spider-Man is not just the suit. It's the man wearing it. Just like Tony said, ""If you're nothing without this suit, then you shouldn't have it."" Really loved the scene when he realises what Tony meant by that and rose up from the ""ashes"" (rubbles to be more specific). A great redeeming moment for the kid and the man he became. Further, this movie keeps the series open to so many possibilities since some of the characters shown in the movie have had important roles in comics. Don't want to mention them here but there are more than five.<br/><br/>In the end, I think the MCU has finally given Spider-Man the movie he deserves and he has now come back home to Marvel.

Avengers were the #1 Movie for me in MCU but this easily is on par with them. RDJ is practically Tom's surrogate dad. He is more than a mentor. I'd really want to see a full length movie of Ironman and Spider- Man. At last, MCU always lagged of a worthy villain (Except Loki and a few ), Toomes is already in the top 5 big bad's of MCU. This is not overstating, he is the best villain since Loki. Vulture took the whole movie to other level. This is the definition of a Fun movie. The definition of how MCU is successful in their Genre.

"justinwestramusic","10","43","72","18 October 2017"," Most complaints were from people who misunderstood this movie.
","After reading several different negative reviews, there seemed to be a lot of people complaining about some of the same ""issues"", but they all seem to miss the point of this movie, and the reasoning why writers do certain things differently. I have been a Spider-Man fan for over 10 years, and I enjoyed the Raimi and Webb films very much.<br/><br/>People have complained quite a bit about how Peter Parker was portrayed throughout the film as selfish and his acts as Spider-Man were only done so he could become an Avenger, and for a portion of the film, this is correct, but it is not a terrible thing. Peter is 15-years old in this movie, he is a kid, and he of course is not very mature yet though he is very intelligent (he made the web shooters, answered questions correctly in class without having to pay attention, etc.) In a world where the Avengers are all over the news, of course a kid with super abilities dreams of being in the Avengers, and that is his motivation throughout most of the film. Peter has had his abilities for less than a year so he is still learning the ropes, thus why he is so destructive during the van chase scene. While many people complain that ""this is not how Spider-Man should be"", they seem to miss the part where the switch in Peter's head is flipped. The scene when the Vulture covered Peter in the rubble and he had to struggle to get out, he realized how strong he truly is, and that being a hero is not about being a ""cool"" Avenger, and that is not easy. This is when Peter truly became Spider-Man, this is when Peter cared more about stopping the Vulture because he is a dangerous threat, and not because it would make Tony happy. For the first time, Peter stopped thinking about himself, and that is when he became a true hero. This is reiterated when Tony offers Peter a spot with the Avengers and he turns Tony down. He wants to save lives, and be a real hero before he can be an Avenger.<br/><br/>The high-tech suit is one of the most complained about aspects of this movie. Personally, I think this suit is a perfect way to integrate Spider-Man into the MCU. It makes perfect sense that if Tony Stark is going to take a 15-year old kid under his wing, that he would give him some of the similar technology that he currently uses. The moving eyes feature is one of my favorites, mostly because within the comic books, the illustrators used Spider-Man's eyes to express emotion while within the suit, whereas in the Raimi trilogy, and in The Amazing Spider-Man series, Spider-Man's eyes could not move on the suit, so to show emotion, his mask would have to be ripped off his face. The moving eyes technology is a logical way to allow Spider-Man to show emotion while in the suit. Also, the AI (Karen) was also complained about a lot. Again, referring to the comic books, Peter talked to himself a lot, or at least thought a lot while in the suit. The AI creates a logical reason for Peter to talk to himself while running around as Spider-Man without looking like a psychopath.<br/><br/>Besides this, many people were complaining about the character changes. Flash Thompson (Tony Revolori) is complained about because he is a ""small Indian kid"", first, he is Guatemalan, not Indian. Flash was portrayed in a very similar way in the Raimi and Webb series', it was time for Flash to be changed. In 2017, bullies are not just physical bullies anymore, they are verbal/mental bullies that prey on insecurities, and this makes a lot of sense for Flash to be this type of bully within the context of the film. A ""dumb jock"" type bully does not fit into the mold of someone who attends ""Midtown School of Science and Technology"". Flash hurts Peter's reputation, and makes him feel like an outcast, but the scene at the bus when Peter asks to rejoin the academic decathlon team and Flash walks towards him, Peter backs away from Flash as if he feels intimidated by him. Though Flash is not a huge guy, either is Peter, so up until Peter received his abilities, Flash was probably able to push Peter around.<br/><br/>Another obvious character who was changed in this movie was Aunt May, but I think this is for the better. Aunt May, portrayed by Marisa Tomei is not as young as people make her out to be, she is 52-years old and though she is not 80+ like in the Raimi trilogy, this makes more sense that a 52-year old woman would have a 15-year old nephew. Plus, this gives Peter and his aunt more of a mother and son dynamic, and considering Peter's parents died when he was young and Aunt May and Uncle Ben raised Peter, having her seem as a younger motherly figure as opposed to a grandmother figure makes more sense for the story.<br/><br/>The Michelle ""MJ"" Easter-egg was taken too literally. Michelle could be a potential love interest for Peter, but she is not Mary Jane, the writers as well as Zendaya have confirmed this. The MJ name drop was done as an Easter-egg, not as a serious character introduction.<br/><br/>Overall, I really enjoyed this movie. It was not perfect, but this was a great film to explain how Peter went from being an excited kid in a costume trying to impress Tony, to becoming a true hero. The humor was fantastic, the cast seemed to have true chemistry together, it was aesthetically pleasing, the soundtrack was catchy, the Vulture was one of the best MCU villains to date, and I am very excited to see what else Marvel does with the character."

"Ryan_Barbakins","8","11","15","2 July 2019"," A Great new Re-imagining of Spider-Man!
","I think at this point, everyone is sick of the spider-man story. We all know that Uncle Ben dies, and Spider-Man makes his suit, but this is something we needed. We needed a new story with this character. I think portraying him as a little younger than usual works for his character. I love this movie, because Tom Holland's version of spider-man is very relatable. It can be easy to look at the MCU as just a giant super hero universe far from ours, but in this movie we see a high school kid in New York go on a field trip. We see him walking through the halls of school, and we see how the kids, and regular people react to the existence of superheros in this world.
This main reason is what gets me going back to the movie. There aren't too many MCU movies that portray this feeling. However I think some of this movie doesn't work as well as it should. Spider-Man is given a really powerful suit that just feels like a spider version of Iron Man. Sure that works in differentiating it, but you don't get the struggle of him making the suit, which can build character, and give great emotions when he uses the suit in battle.
All of the characters feel developed pretty well. Even some of the Decathlon team seemed pretty involved, which is great. However Aunt May didn't have as big a role in this movie, but hopefully now that she knows Peter is spider-man, she will be more prominent in Far From Home.
Overall a really fun movie, and one of my favorite MCU movies surprisingly!"

The part when peter first puts on his suit is incredible. One of my favorite scenes was when spider-man saves his friends from the Washington monument, it was very intense... The music played well with the scenes and made it more intense. Tom Holland is the right actor for this part, acts more like a teenager than the first two actors who have portrayed this character. Robert downy Jr played a good part in this movie, Tony acted like a mentor to peter, after Bruce banner left, tony felt lonely and wanted a friend... Thats where peter came in. Some parts were hilarious, the scene where Ned was in the computer room and the woman asks why he is in there after school, he replies with ""I was looking at, porn"" very funny scene... There was many intense scenes during this movie, like vulture and peter are fighting on the avengers plane, also the scene where Adrian (vulture) and peter where in the car before the homecoming dance, it makes you feel scared for whats coming. The A.I in the suit was amazing, just like iron man... The scene where peter first puts on the suit without 'THE TRAINING WHEELS PROTOCOL' is cool... I love how he is ACTUALLY at teenager in this movie, makes it feel that spider-man is one of us... Just a normal teen.

","Our take: See it in theaters. The extra $2 for a 3-D showing will not be a waste. Post credit scene? Yes, two, so just wait until that last Sony logo appears to get up and leave.<br/><br/>You would hope that when they do a reboot every three years they'd learn something. And they did. Spider-Man: Homecoming is a fun, fresh, and fast-paced installation and the movie we've been waiting years for. Forget the doom and gloom, forgot convoluted side plots, forget Oscorp and the Bugle, forget the awkward emo dance moves ‚Äî this movie eliminated it all and tucked the canon neatly into the MCU instead. Somehow, it was even able to give the newly introduced villain, Vulture, a grounded backstory in the universe. After his backdoor- pilot mission in Civil War, Holland finally gives us a coming-of-age, high school Peter Parker story instead of just handing us an amazing Spider-Man. With very little exposition necessary (sorry Uncle Ben, but we've seen you die, A LOT) the movie was allowed to explore the character and struggles that Peter Parker has in both high school and as a hero, in ways the other films failed to (Incredibly, movies about high schoolers are so much better when you cast younger actors instead of British men in their 30s that you have to get out of high ASAP because the aging process doesn't stop.) Added to the mix are a sidekick (Ned played by Jacob Batalon) that often steals the show a lot of sidekick comedy, a stupid high school crush (Liz played by Laura Harrier), and an MCU caliber villain creating an instant hit for all ages. Even with the occasional plot or character stumble, the film was able to deliver an amusing and entertaining look at the new Spider-Man franchise. But The film leaves you with a familiar feeling, and yet, it also feels completely new ‚Äî it's an increasingly delightful dichotomy and direction for these films to be heading in."

","In my opinion, there has not been a good Spider-Man movie since Spider-Man 2. I love the original two Raimi movies and grew up with them. Unfortunately, the three that would follow those movies were incredibly disappointing and lacked the spirit of the character. As a result, there was a ton of pressure on this film to succeed, and it does with flying colors. <br/><br/>Firstly, I have to give praise to Tom Holland. He absolutely nailed the character of Peter Parker. When he was in the Spidey costume, he also absolutely rocked it. The look of the character (the actual suit itself) is awesome and he throws quips all the time without it feeling gimmicky or forced like it did in the Amazing Spider-Man movies. The supporting characters also were fantastic. Michelle was a very fun side character who had some fun moments (although I really did not like the fact that she ended up being MJ as she acts nothing like that character), as were Liz and Ned. Those characters really added emotional weight to Peter's story and I thought that it was incredibly well-handled. <br/><br/>The action was grade-A Marvel. Although I would not definitively say that the action in this film is quite as good as it was in Raimi's, it is extremely well-choreographed and, when CGI was necessary (which was often), it looked top-notch. The humor, as it usually is in MCU movies, was also fantastic and there were a lot of laughs in the theater that I saw it in. The final post credit scene was also really funny.<br/><br/>The main twist of the movie was obviously the fact that the Vulture was Liz's father. I get the sense that many people will be upset about this since it is a huge coincidence, but there have been coincidences all throughout Spider-Man lore in the movies, cartoons, and comics. Let's not forget that Peter's best friend's dad in the comics, Norman Osborn, ends up being his archnemesis. The Vulture as a character, unfortunately, did leave me slightly underwhelmed. He is definitely a top-tier Marvel villain, as he at least has a personality and clear goals unlike previous characters in the MCU, but I felt like there should have been more to his character. He was two- dimensional, which is better than one-dimensional, but I think that he could have been even better. However, the look of the character is absolutely perfect and Michael Keaton was really good in the film. The scene where Peter finds out that he is Michelle's dad had so much tension and was very well-handled.<br/><br/>I also have a gripe with the references made to the MCU throughout the film. They were all very fun and creative, but I think that there were some that were just unnecessary. I almost feel like that is Sony's doing since they have really wanted to drive home the fact that this film takes place in the MCU. It takes away the standalone nature of the film to a certain extent. However, Tony Stark was in the movie for just the right amount and never changed the focus of the film. Towards the end, I thought it was perfect to have Stark and Peter together in the new Avengers facility. The fact that they were also able to incorporate an arc for Tony's character in this film despite his extremely limited screen time was really impressive and I look forward to seeing his relationship with Spider-Man grow even more.<br/><br/>Overall, I was extremely pleased with Spider-Man homecoming and I think it is probably the second or third best movie in the MCU. Spider-Man fans finally now have another film that will be almost universally loved.<br/><br/>9/10 Grade: A-"

","I was totally unimpressed by the Spiderman. I watched it three times figuring I was wrong but I found each time I just wanted to smack the kid. He acted like he was 12 just hitting puberty. I don't blame the acting, as he did a great job, but I do blame the writers. Tom was following the script he was given and the directing. The saving grace to this movie was the cinematography, action and special effects. And of course Ironman."

","The film should have been called Spider-Boy. And this Spider-Boy is one of the most annoying characters that I have ever seen in any film. The film is more in the style of an episode of Tom and Jerry with slapstick gags and all. Overall, the special effects were good. Acting was good (though I cannot remember when an actor annoyed me so much) but the story line was extremely poor. The choice of supporting actors was also terrible to say the least. It seemed that the producers and directors decided to follow the United Nations diversity Employment charter, even though most of the characters detracted from the story. So no more Spider-Boy for me."

","i can say i honestly loved it, i love tom's portail as spider-man/peter parker i love how his love interest is liz instead of Gwen or MJ this time to avoid similarities speaking of which i do love how the decided to skip the origin story which would of be fine if it was the Andrew Garfield story arc but in the MCU, but anyway the high tech version of vulture was actually amazing the relationship between peter and tony and happy is great, and the ending that hints for the sinister six to show up with tombs and Gargan, i have to say have been waiting since sandman showed up in 3 and then again at the end of amazing 2 with all the cameos , but i few things really did bug me, flash Thompson being one of the, like spiderman and the amazing spider man were pretty close with the whole school bully thing but the the MCU... i was hoping for someone who actually looked like he could be flash but honestly he is the exact opposite, and the other MJ like what?! i kind would rather she didn't show up at all then it be someone whose name isn't actually Mary Jane Watson let alone looks anything like her, i know people are changing but.. really mj...really? i just hope its slows down a bit since the 1st guy to play shocker looked more like him then the 2nd guy, i know comic back in the day were a bit umm colour friendly and even though i am dark skinned it still really bugs me that it happens so much like i love Donald Glover but when people said Donald for Peter Parker i still went nah better as miles, by the way i am so glad he was still in the movie, but Fury, Flash, MJ, Shocker the list goes on for both DC and Marvel, Also i really hope they don't ruin venom by skipping straight to a solo movie rather than later dawing the symbiot fist then passing it on to eddie vire the bell tower that's just to iconic to skip and then carnage maybe even toxin, saw a photo of Cameron Monaghan as Carnage/Cletus Kasady and i think it would be a fantastic choice just throwing that out there. sorry for getting off topic kinda but all in all still loved the movie, can't wait to see what follows."

He made a great spiderman but a horrible Peter."
"gus76","4","49","85","14 July 2017"," Spiderman: Snoozefest
","Is the MCU now immune to negative reviews? Such is the love for Tony Stark and co. that anything they now appear seems impervious to fan boy criticism. Spiderman: Homecoming has been receiving glowing praise with some critics going as far to say this is the best Spiderman film yet and the best superhero film of the year so far. I sometimes thought as if I was watching a different film then, as to me this was big disappointment. I was bored watching it, and I felt like most of the audience was too. There was no laughter in the cinema during the 'comedy' moments, just lots of uncomfortable fidgeting.<br/><br/>After calls from fans to 'give it back Marvel 'it was great to see Spiderman appear with other Marvel hero's in the excellent Civil War, something that most us did not think we would ever see.<br/><br/>But maybe this is case of be careful what you wish for, as despite Marvel providing creative input, this feels like the lest Spiderman like Spiderman movie so far. SpiderIronman may be a better title or Ironspider?<br/><br/>Spiderman's suite is provided by Tony Stark, and aside from not being able to fly, works pretty much the same as his own suite. It has a similar heads up display, and array of weapons to select from, its own attachable drone and most its equivalent to Jarvis, called Karen (voiced by Jennifer Connelly, wife of Paul Bettany, aka Jarvis¬Öhmm)<br/><br/>It just didn't feel like I was watching Spiderman with all these gadgets. I did hope towards the end that maybe this was on purpose so when he was striped of them he would rely on his own ability. But this it was not be and he gets them all back.<br/><br/>This film try's hard to be funny and cool, with throwbacks to 80's John Hughes films. And in case you didn't get that, one scene even has a TV randomly placed showing the same John Hughes film it is paying homage to. Very meta hey? And when Peter Parkers best friend wears the Spiderman mask, its funny because he's fat right? Ahh good one lets all laugh at the fatty. The constant attempts at humour and usual MCU quips, strip the film of any tension.<br/><br/>Michael Keaton's Vulture could have been a great villain but is wasted. People hate on Spiderman 3, but at least I was never stifling yawns watching that. The opening fight in that film with Harry Osborne was far more exciting than any encounters Spiderman has with the Vulture here. The Vulture is a flying villain, so that should set up some vertigo inducing aerial battles through and over the city. But the best confrontation they have is sitting in a car.<br/><br/>Spiderman himself seems to be the cause of his own problems. He's the most accident-prone superhero this side of Mr Magoo. In this film he manages to indirectly blow up the Washington Monument, tear a ship in half and crash a plane into a beach, taking a fairground ride with it and possible killing dog walkers taking a stroll by the sea.<br/><br/>There is no sense of awe in this film. None of the epic and dizzying web swinging action we saw back in the Sam Raimi films. The actions scenes are lacklustre and ends in messy and scrappy CGI fight on a plane, of which somehow both Spiderman and the Vulture survive crashing and exploding on impact.<br/><br/>It speaks volumes when the recently shown preview of Spiderman on PS4 has better Spiderman action than this film provides at any point.<br/><br/>At the end of the film, a very annoying hipster girl who pops up now and again reveals her name is Michelle, but people call her MJ. What? Surely this is not going to be MJ? Michelle? Although I did read recently that producer Kevin Fegie has stated this is not the new Mary Jane. If that is so, why the MJ line? Just trolling for the sake of it. Hopefully this is not the 'real' Flash Thompson or 'real' Shocker either.<br/><br/>The film feels cheap. Its hard to say why, but it looks and feels like a kids film. Was it the director? Hard to say. I am big fan of his previous two releases. The best part of the film is the aforementioned stand off between Toomes and Parker in the car, which shows though the directors horror credentials. The film needed more of this, to generate tension and threat for our hero to come through. Sam Raimis horror skills also showed through on his films with that bruising fist fight between Goblin and Spiderman and the infamous hospital scene in Spiderman 2. Scary, brutal and brilliant. Such a shame we don't have these kind of scenes anymore.<br/><br/>I really hoped for something fresh and new with this but what we have is still very much Spiderman by committee, only now with added MCU cameos.<br/><br/>It's a shame but we will probably never get another Spiderman film that comes close to the greatness of Spiderman and Spiderman 2."

","Not only does this continue Marvel's streak of fun, light-hearted action, it perfectly captures the high school environment and the personality of a teenage superhero who strives to help others, struggles to keep his identity a secret, and wants to lead a normal high school kid's life more than anything. the story is fun, engaging, emotional, and unexpected. the villain character was well-developed, none of the clich√© characters we're used to from old spiderman movies, the love interest was perfectly handled, nothing too cringy or over dramatic, basically what you'd expect from a marvel movie and more. i can't think of anything they could've changed to make me like this movie better, and for that i give it a 10"
"jaapeelman","6","26","42","2 October 2017"," Childish Spiderman-movie with dumb story-line
","In this Spiderman-movie we see Peter Parker as he struggles at school to impress the girl he likes and at the same time waits at a call from Iron-man to help to save the world. I personally do not like the mixture Iron man-the Avengers-Spiderman as I believe that the character of Spiderman is strong enough for a movie without Iron man or any other Marvel-character. The story is pretty stupid because a villain (Michael Keaton) is making and selling powerful weapons with alien-technology and nobody seems to care. Only Spidey and as he tracks down the source Iron-man tells him to back-off. Why? And neither the police, the FBI or the so-called Damage Control seems to be interested in catching the criminals who sells the alien-weapons. The special effects are great and that is the only positive thing to tell about this movie. It is a stupid and childish movie and not doing justice to the character of Spiderman. If you still want to watch it: rent it or even better download it because it is not worth spending money on."

","An American feature film of 2017 directed by John Watts with Tom Holland and Michael Keaton in the lead roles. The script is based on comics by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko of Marvel Comics. World premiere of the picture took place on June 28, 2017 in Hollywood.
The action takes place a few months after the events described in the film ""The First Avenger: Confrontation."" According to the story, Peter Parker is trying to find a balance between school life and to be a Spider-Man, while facing the Vulture.
The best thing about the film is the script (written by John Watts), which is fast and funny. The music's cool. The performances are great.
Would I recommended the film? Yes, I would. It's one of the most interesting comedies I've seen in recent years!

","I grew up reading Spider-Man and I still have several of those original issues tucked away in the closet, to be passed on. I was excited when this movie started but that excitement was gone within the first few minutes. I found myself watching a political propaganda movie put out in the guise of a real Spider-Man movie. If you love a steady diet of politics then this movie is for you. If not.. then don't even bother because it starts out political and just stays political. A truly bad movie in my opinion."

","It's without a doubt that Tom Holland official became my favourite Spider-Man actor after this movie. <br/><br/>If you enjoyed his performance in Captain America Civil War you will love his performance in this movie. <br/><br/>Though my only annoyance is that Tony gave him a suit to use but he never made one for himself and the fact that he was mentoring him throughout the movie. Another thing which is a massive annoyance is that Peter Parker seems to hate Captain America despite the fact he claimed in the previous movie he is a big fan of him. <br/><br/>The best scene is when the Vulture and Spiderman are having there final fight.<br/><br/>It was nice seeing Michael Keaton in a Marvel movie after doing Batman back in the late 80's/90's it was a nice change. <br/><br/>Overall awesome movie."
"BiiivAL","9","81","148","4 June 2018"," Another friendly neighbor
","To hell with the whining about what this is about restarting about Spider-Man, after all the friendly neighbor in red-and-blue tights finally became a part of the Marvel coterie, and these guys know a lot about their business, and, most importantly, learn from mistakes . You can compare three different Spiders and their performers endlessly, but this is almost the same as the argument that Parker distorts on MJ in comics, and what - in the film. Strictly speaking, not everything is put according to a certain pattern, hence the different screen versions, different characters and stories. However, if you could find fault with Maguire for snotty, and Garfield for self-centeredness, Holland is still more difficult to make claims, as Marvelers see a fresh approach to working with the character taking into account past flaws and, importantly, without selfrepetition. We will not be shown either the bite of the radioactive spider or the death of Uncle Ben, nor will they remind us that ""great power comes with great responsibility,"" even though Tony Stark, Peter's current mentor, seems to have been trying. Spiderman again appears as a schoolboy, except that this time school life really boils.<br/><br/>A flying dude does not surprise anyone in tights, especially in New York, where the residents saw the alien invasion and the battle of the Avengers. You will think, the guy weaves a web, - there, the muzhik turns to the green bully, and the Scandinavian god thunderes all with a magic hammer. Therefore, understanding the whole situation, the creators use, perhaps, the most successful method - irony. And it manifests itself in all its glory: the film ironically over superpowers and clich√©s, and in the end and at all successfully jokes over spectators who stubbornly sit down to the end of the credits. As for the superhero life, it does not really fit in with the school, and Parker learns to combine saving the city and passing the test in Spanish, and also spending time with Aunt Mei. By the way, we have the most sexy Aunt May, about which the creators will not miss the opportunity to joke. A spider, as it turns out, is not always super-krut: he also has to run around without cobwebs, and crash into different objects, and, after all, he can make mistakes, like any teenager who is also motivated by the desire to prove himself. Peter does not have much time to show the old woman the path, he wants something more. And without waiting for a call from Stark or Happy, he enters into a confrontation with the Vulture, who, along with his team, collects weapons from extraterrestrial wrecks after that very battle of the Avengers.<br/><br/>Among other advantages, John Watts' film stands out for its earthiness and realism, despite the fact that the action takes place within the Marvel cable car. Realistic, of course, relative, but the picture does not have that patheticity that was in the possession of Raimi or Webb, ""Homecoming"" is even more prosaic than the previous Marvel tapes, and it's ironic. Which is no less important, so it's a slightly more interesting antagonist than the typical Marvelovsky, which, thanks to the charisma of Michael Keaton, does not fade in the background of the main character. Moreover, the Vulture appears not as a classic villain, trying to destroy everything and everything, but an ordinary person who wants, like Parker, to prove himself somehow, although for this he chooses a wrong way. Watt's tape - in fact, it's a story about growing up, about mistakes of youth and the right decisions made due to some life experience. That's why watching Parker's school life is no less interesting than watching his superhero adventures. Funny episodes sometimes turn into dramatic, but the film follows the balance and does not slide into pathos, even wherever it could. The picture has a contagious energy, to match his hero. And it's definitely the same ""Spider-Man"" that will please the boy inside of you, even if he grew up on Raimi movies."

I've seen reviews saying it is the best Spider- man movie ever. I can't agree with that because the villain and some supporting characters are so underdeveloped. Tom Holland tries a ultimate spider-man style but in the end all we get is the Kung-fu Panda version of spider-man. It was fun in civil war because it was short but here he keeps whining about it almost every minute when he was Peter Parker. In overall, this is just another MCU popcorn movie.

So Peter is a kid who likes a senior, because she's pretty. So he's never even so much as talked to her, and suddenly, oh, she wants him to come to her party. Yep. They talk as if they have known each other for years. And the other characters in the math club don't get so much as a couple of sentences. Flash isn't a bully, he is now a minor verbal threat. Action in this movie has no reason for happening, Peter just does whatever. No explanation why.

Keaton's work in particular was a bit underwhelming for me, but that's not his fault... it's the screenplay, which to be honest felt a bit forced and not up to standards for an MCU movie.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, it's a great stand-alone flick you should definitely watch.

"Zephrey","10","140","272","6 July 2017"," Spectacularly funny and definitely above your average superhero movie
","The movie straight out blew my breath away, yes I'll admit my expectation weren't high, with the 5 other average Spider-man films that came before this, I wasn't expecting anything different then interactions with the avengers.<br/><br/>(1). Let me first start off with the beginning of the film. I think the reason that this movie was so amazing was that the fact that a lot of young teenagers could relate to being Peter Parker, the writers made an excellent choice of choosing a young Peter, this made the movie so much easier to relate to, they showed real social problems concerning the lives of high schoolers at the same time making it a little more dramatic and adding humour which probably made this movie one of the best superhero movies I've ever seen, and let me tell that I've seen almost every single live action superhero adaption ever.<br/><br/>(2). Second off was the fact that this wasn't one of the (whole world is ending, lets save it) clich√©s. In my personal opinion I'm tired and sick of these because they are getting way to unbearable to watch. Which Batman V Superman showed us. Anyways I loved how they kept the movie realistic ( I know I sound so Ironic right now ) in Peter having his limits of being Spider-man, they kept real as in Peter had to worry about being a student while at the same time protecting his neighborhood, and at the same time his hero level. <br/><br/>(3). Third off the best part of the movie was the Humour. This wasn't little kids funny jokes humour, like I said before the writers made the movie easy to relate to for students, so the jokes were definitely above little kids humour, Id say around Community kind, which is the best. The jokes weren't lame like in The amazing Spider-man so I don't know a great to explain the jokes and the type of humour is the review so all I can say is go watch the movie yourself. I assure you will not be disappointed. <br/><br/>(4). Fourthly and lastly Thank you SONY for giving my favorite superhero back to the rightful owners and not trying to screw it up, by making a third reboot with your company only. One of the big differences from the Tobey Maguire Spider-man movies was that it didn't revolve around LOVE the whole time. That was the one thing I couldn't bear, yes I think that romance definitely plays a big role in all movies, but the ones with Maguire only revolved around that, so I just couldn't put up with them. Anyways Homecoming keeps all the action, humour and romance balanced which is all thanks to Jon Watts I truly believe they picked the right director for the 3rd reboot of the Spider-man film. He was able to balance everything so that they fit in perfectly with everything else, like a jigsaw puzzle. I'm not even going to start with Andrew Garfield, I mean they should've stopped after the first movies. <br/><br/>Anyways I highly recommend that you watch this in theaters because it just makes the experience so much better. <br/><br/>Honestly for me this is one of the best superhero movies that's ever came out, I believe that MARVEL can now go for with Spider-man and not to mention the amazing acting from Tom Holland he nailed his role perfectly that all I can say<br/><br/>Anyways stop reading this and go watch it if you haven't already."
"neiledward_diaz","10","136","264","10 July 2017"," Perfect version of Peter Parker and Spider-Man
","Spider-Man is literally the most loved Marvel hero of all time! At last, this reboot perfectly captured the balance between Peter Parker and Spider-Man in the comics! Peter's awkward nature in high school and his attempts at being a cool superhero are both relatable and funny. Tom Holland played a good Peter Parker with the nerdy, awkward way and he manifested one of Spider-Man's significant traits: his sense of humor. The movie is full of Easter eggs and references to the comics, the previous Spidey movies, and the MCU as a whole. Not only does this movie look really good, but the villain (Vulture) looks menacing as a great villain should. How the hell did they make one of the silliest villains awesome?Ôªø That's the Marvel Magic."
"jdogkg","10","141","275","8 July 2017"," This film was absolutely incredible!!!!
","I am a huge fan of Spiderman, I love the original trilogy (yes even the third one) I really liked Tobey Maguire and felt he did a great job. I think the Andrew Garfield films, while enjoyable, really lacked the tone of a Spiderman film. So I can tell you, this was easily my most anticipated movie of 2017, but I do have to remember that I can't keep my expectations as high as a drug addict. So as the film started, while pumped, I also was just praying it would be awesome. So... I AM VERY HAPPY TO TELL YOU THIS MOVIE IS FANTASTIC!!!!!!! The entire time watching it I had a smile on my face! ‚ò∫ First off the acting is great, Tom Holland was born to play this role. All his friends, the villains, and of course Robert Downey Jr did awesome like always. Next the action, the web swinging sequences, the high flying fighting and intensity was all handled so well, Marvel always achieves greatness with that. You can really feel the brutality and fear of the characters while watching. Let's talk about Micheal Keaton as the vulture wow! What an incredible villain! He was very intimidating with the suit on but also, a terrific character underneath the suit. While I am a fan of the MCU I do agree, a majority of their villains suck. But Keaton really was different. He had so much depth and motivation which I adored. And there is one big shocker towards the end which even put more emotional weight towards his character. This movie is not just another marvel movie. Spiderman Homecoming is very unique and special in its own way. Of course the CGI was great like always. The story was written in a way we can all adore. There are so many twists and turns and unexpected paths it chooses to take which was the right direction. And last, the humor was hilarious! Laughter is the best medicine. Peter's friend Ned was a addition that fit like Cinderella's slipper. Spiderman Homecoming is definitely the best Spiderman movie to date and I say you definitely should go out and see this one!"
"yasmenramen","9","10","14","29 October 2017"," Best Spider-Man movie
","The best Spider-Man movie in a while. Holland really excelled in the role and brought a unique take on the character. Holland is probably the funniest Spider-Man ever. All though it left me wanting more scenes and a longer running time. I however liked how the film rejected some elements of the older films, such as the age of the actor and character."
"myignisrules","6","122","236","6 July 2017"," Well made movie but it was missing the heart
","Marvel without a doubt, knows the formula to make an visually appealing, fun and well paced superhero movie. There's a lot to love about Spiderman Homecoming, from Tom Holland's take on a teenage Peter Parker (although the tone of his voice grated from time to time) to a solid villain in Vulture, played to perfection by Michael Keaton. There were also some awesome action sequences, my favs being the ferry and the final battle against The Vulture. Sadly, the emotional connection I needed, to make this a truly awesome version of Spidey never came (for me) Raimi's Spiderman 2 hit every note perfectly, and is still in my humble opinion the best Spidey movie out there. While this one looks good, the depth is sorely lacking and with the way Wonder Woman left me feeling so fresh in my head, it was just more obvious to me, that they played it safe and pandered to the easiest base to appease, the Spidey fans, with this one."
"alva3901","8","67","124","6 July 2017"," Spider-man: Homecoming proves that Tom Holland is the perfect Spider-man
","The enduring presence of Spiderman on the big screen over the past fifteen years presumably caused a little fatigue once news spread of the third depiction of the crime-fighting hero. However, Spiderman: Homecoming fails to induce such feelings as the exuberant Tom Holland masters the role as Peter Parker in almost every way. After seeing him briefly in Captain America: Civil War and now under the wings of Marvel Studios, the introduction of Spiderman into the ever-expanding MCU proves to be an incredibly entertaining ride. <br/><br/>Spiderman: Homecoming is a very well directed film, as Jon Watts gives us a joyful adventure of the teenager Peter Parker who troubles to find the balance between his personal and superhero life. Still consumed by the actions he took against the likes of Captain America in Civil War, Peter Parker becomes a desperate man, hoping to join the Avengers and impress Tony Stark aka Iron Man, who acts as his mentor. It is with this mentality that he becomes entrenched into the Spiderman persona that has severe ramifications on his social life, both at home and at school. And as the nerdy and unpopular teenager, he uses his hidden persona to define his own sense of duty and morals. As seen in one of the trailers, Tony Stark chastises Peter, quoting, ""If your nothing without this suit, you shouldn't have it"". Tom Holland develops great chemistry with Robert Downey Jr in all their scenes, however, Tony Starks appearance doesn't shy away from the fact that this is a Spiderman film. This is a film that is grounded to Spiderman, and Spiderman only. <br/><br/>His high school story was very intriguing to watch, as we meet Ned (Jacob Batalon) who aids Peter Parker as his nerdy and funny best friend, Michelle (Zendaya) as the quirky, yet the lonely student who stands in the background, and Liz (Laura Harrier), Peter's accessible love interest. With Spiderman, Peter becomes less involved with the school, causing dysfunctional relationships to occur between him and many other students. Likewise at home with Aunt May (Marisa Tomei), who we see Peter become more distant with her as his agendas begin to take over. <br/><br/>The main villain, the Vulture, is unlike many of Marvel's villains, in that he is the most human out of all of them. He despises the rich and the powerful messing up the lives of those below them, in this case, Tony Stark and he cares deeply about his family, wanting to do everything in his power to keep them safe and happy. His backstory, seen in the opening of the film, and the effects of his actions proves that Adrian Toomes (his hidden persona) has more redeeming qualities than one might expect of a villain. Michael Keaton brilliantly plays the role, adding hidden depths rarely seen in a Superhero villain.<br/><br/>Of course, every movie comes with its negatives, however, those in Homecoming are only minor. I would've like to see more of Marisa Tomei and Donald Glover, and possibly some other secondary characters, yet I do see them playing a major role in the future of Spiderman. Another minor problem was the music score by Michael Giacchino, who actually created some really good music pieces, but I personally felt that it wasn't enough to lift it even further to something more memorable. <br/><br/>Overall, the action was solid, yet the film serves better as a character-driven story rather than the usual action we tend to see in other Marvel movies which may disappoint some fans. However, comic book films are about the characters and Spiderman: Homecoming accomplishes that extremely well. Tom Hollands gifts us with a great performance of the crime-fighting, friendly neighborhood Spiderman, accompanied by a great villain acted superbly by Michael Keaton, and a host of secondary characters that really complete a very well written film."
"vinniec-53536","9","20","32","30 April 2018"," Best Spider-Man Film To Date!
","'Spider-Man Homecoming' is, in my opinion, the best Spider-Man film to date and one of the best superhero films ever made. Tom Holland is the definitive on-screen Peter Parker/Spidey and perfectly embodies the personality, spirit, and youthfulness of the character. Michael Keaton is fantastic as main villain, the Vulture, and is one of Marvel Studios' best antagonists thus far. He is chilling to watch and very intimidating. The rest of the cast give stellar performances, especially Peter's best friend Ned and Aunt May. Robert Downey Jr.'s role is small, but vital to the film's captivating plot and story. The action scenes are breath-taking, and I loved seeing a less-experienced Spider-Man who is just now learning how to use and control his newfound abilities. The movie is also hilarious and probably one of the funniest comic book films so far. I also loved seeing Spidey doing good deeds and committing random acts of kindness around Queens, NY, and the film uses the NYC setting perfectly. In conclusion, 'Homecoming' was an absolute delight to watch and I look forward to seeing more of this version of Spider-Man and his journey to full-fledged superhero in the future, and it can't come soon enough."

"s3276169","5","22","36","1 October 2017"," Teenie Superhero Angst.....
","If your age demographic is somewhere between 13 -16 you may actually be able to relate to Spider-Man (or is that Spider-Boy) Homecoming.<br/><br/>This film is chocked full of truly gruesome ""teenie angst"" as poor little teen Spider boy moves ever so awkwardly towards spidery adulthood. The pimply clich√©s culled from almost any, ""coming of age"" codswallop you care to mention come thick and fast, leaving this mature viewer, squirming uncomfortably in their seat. <br/><br/>What this means, in my opinion, is this film has very narrow appeal. Its unsophisticated fare that may not even engage more switched on teens and is certainly not accessible, to mature viewers, like myself either. <br/><br/>On the upside the acting is passable and the action scenes are competent but really those factors on their own are not enough to make this film anything other than bland fare at best. Five out of ten from me."
"Morten_5","8","110","215","5 July 2017"," Scaled-down, truly witty and surprisingly fresh
","It may seem greedy and a bit stupid doing another Spider-Man reboot so short after the last one, but Homecoming brings something fresh.<br/><br/>Talented Tom Holland is an amazing asset to the movie. His charisma and comic timing balances this new Spider-Man flick in way that both makes you care more about what happens in the movie and, more importantly, brings a well-needed break from the somewhat mechanic action of the Avengers and Captain America movies. <br/><br/>It's a bold move letting young and rather inexperienced feature film director Jon Watts (""Clown"", ""Cop Car"") direct a blockbuster of these proportions. Usually, this is done in order to make it easier for the producers and the studio to control the production, but here, clearly, we're given the vision of a director and not the formulaic mess the studios sometimes forces through. <br/><br/>Last but not least, kudos to composer maestro Michael Giacchino, who's created what is probably the strongest Marvel score this far."
"aharmas","10","119","234","9 July 2017"," Winning Streak
","It feels good when one goes to a movie, and everything works out, both in the audience and the film. Coming right after ""Wonder Woman"", the new Spiderman feature is a winner, with the right balance of wonder, fun, and danger. Both films have fantastic performances by actors who seem to understand and fully impersonate their special characters. Tom Holland, appeared at first, too frail to fill Garfield's shoes, but he surpasses him because here is a character that fully enjoys the growing pains and the gadgets he is not quite entrusted with.<br/><br/>The story is simple and a reminder of those serials of old. Peter/Pedro is basically in trainer both in high school and the superhero world. Of course, there is a mentor, and this one is both cranky and practical, quite resourceful and handy to have around. In spite of being in three ""Ironman"" and a couple of Avenger films, Tony Stark never quite felt human. He bonds very well with his prot√©g√©. This relationship, though not being the heart of the film, gives it a solid base.<br/><br/>Thieves get their hands on some powerful alien energy source, and they seek to make some good cash with it. We don't hear much of imminent end of the world or having adversaries that are not quite easy to understand or defeat. That doesn't mean Peter won't have a tough time dealing with the various hurdles along the way. One wonders what he is going to do in the last third of the film when he loses an essential part of his tools.<br/><br/>There is romance, funny moments, misunderstandings, and a full understanding of what it feels to be a teen, an outsider, and someone who lives for studies and now has an opportunity to ""do something for the world, fighting those bad guys"". It's refreshing to hear that he wants to be the neighborhood hero and fight the small criminals. The film does a very good job creating this environment when Peter visits the local deli and finds himself trying to save its owner later on.<br/><br/>Of course, there are all these people who interact with him, don't quite know what to make of his comings and goings, but they still love him nonetheless. Marissa Tomei is wonderful as his ""cute"" aunt, and his best friend is a kid who doesn't quite match anything we've seen before. He's a bit too enthusiastic about his role as a sidekick, but there is sweetness and innocence oozing from every single pore. He is a perfect match for Peter's (Tom Holland's fresh take) on the main role.<br/><br/>Be prepared to have a good time, with a good story, good acting, and a pretty return to what makes comics successful. We don't want too much because we lose our connection. We want clever, creative, and human."

","The title of this review should have been used as the title of the movie. It has nothing to do with Spider-Man as we know it. Peter Parker was never presented as such a dumb kid as he is in this movie. Boring for the 90% of it - yes, that is 90% of the movie is simply terrible. Remaining 10% is OK. If you've watched the trailer, you can skip the movie. You will find nothing better in the actual movie.

","I've already started my opinion within a subject. This movie is a joke. Screenplay is... wait there is almost no screenplay at all. It looks like multiple scenes joined together by using superglue. And why the heck they are mixing everything from great Marvel's world in one movie?! Hollywood crew is destroying Marvel's world. Instead of focusing on particular Marvel hero per movie we have a mix of multiple heroes. So when I'm watching new movie with Marvel's logo on it I'm confused - is this an Iron Man ? or maybe Thor ? oh no wait its Avengers! Heck no its spider-man! Who that heck is creating such scenarios now ? Accountants , bankers , sponsors ? Looks like no one who knows what a good movie is. This... thing (new ""spider-man"") is one big s... . Why the hell they mixed the spider-man with the Avengers movie and IronMan ??? What a stupid idea which destroying both heroes. Screenplay is dramatic, directing is poor, actors has not been selected well for particular roles. The new spider man actor - sorry but who the heck is this ? Some punk who looks like 5 years old kid from kindergarten ? Who's son he is ? A producer or director is his father so they've chose him for this role ? Is this a joke ? Spider-man was a student - about 20-24 years old. The gang of villains is completely bad chose. Only the main character - Michael Keaton - should be well known actor to emphasize his position. Soundtrack ... wait what soundtrack. Some 5 years old kids drawing a pictures and singing at the end of the movie ? WTF!!! Take a look at the Spider-Man 2 soundtrack. Professional artists not some fu... kids. And what is completely sick is the political correctness in this movie - maybe Obama was a director? Michael Keaton character (white guy) has ... black wife. They are completely not matching each other. Man ""hero"" (yeah right) girlfriend is ... who can guess ? YES its BLACK. Main character best friend is... Asian. Kid in the toilet is... Asian. etc etc. WTF. I they want to spread and promote the multi-culti sh... let they make some local movie instead of using Hollywod top characters for this sh... Have you ever seen Asians who mixed white people in their main production ? NO. Only Asians are there. Have you ever seen white people in the Bollywood (India movies) ? NOPE, only India actors are there etc. etc. So why the heck Hollywood is putting this multi-culti ideas in movies like spider-man:homecoming ???????? Let they make movie about Clinton, other politicians, businessman's and PIZZA GATE (pedophilia case in US) if they want to make a movie about some public subject. This movie is a joke."

Starks even belittle Spiderman so many times that u feels like Spiderman is not an important character in the marvel universe.

Nonetheless Tom Holland makes a perfect Peter Parker/Spiderman. Robert Downey Jr. appeared just enough in the movie to be interesting but not enough to upstage the real star that Holland is.

So did ""Spider-Man: Homecomming"" deliver? Yes it did! This movie is in my opinion one of the best the MCU has delivered so far. It's a movie filled with heart, excitement and joy. Tom Holland shines in this role and portrays the struggle of living the life of Peter Parker in a very believable way. He becomes one of the best parts of the film. A issue in most Marvel films is the villain and Vulture (Michael Keaton) is by no means a perfect villain but i think he still is one of the better we have seen in the MCU. It also helps that Vulture is played by such a great actor like Michael Keaton. The story in this film is great. It's a near perfect blend of a teen comedy like ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" and a superhero film.

"RforFilm","9","46","84","7 July 2017"," Homecoming is right as Spider-Man: Homecoming is an awesome return for the web-slinger into the MCU
","Look out folks, we've got another Spider-Man movie swinging into theaters! While most are excited to see their friendly neighborhood hero back for another reboot, I bet a lot are groaning, questioning why another retelling of the web-slinger is necessary. It has to do with the Marvel Cinematic Universe. While Disney has been hitting home run after home run with the rest of the capes, Spider-Man was one of the few characters (at least with movie rights) that Disney couldn't work with. The rights remained with Sony and Colombia due to contracts that were drawn years before Disney bought marvel Comics. <br/><br/>After lower ratings and marginal box office grossings that The Amazing Spider-Man 2 brought in, Disney and Sony sat down to discuss what to do with him. An agreement was made that Sony and Disney would share the character and allow him to join the other Avengers within the same universe, under the condition that Spider-Man would be given a fresh start. He made his debut in Captain America: Civil War with his powers already intact, and was considered one of the best surprises. Now with Spider-Man: Homecoming, we get to see the young characters expansion within the New York streets of Queens.<br/><br/>After the events in Captain America: Civil War, we see that Peter Parker (played by Tom Holland) is trying to balance his high school life and trying out the Spider-Man suit that was made by Tony Stark (played by Robert Downey Jr.) to fight crime in his neighborhood. Despite being powerful and quick, Parker is cocky and urging to become an avenger, despite the protests of his superior Happy Hogan (played by Jon Faverau) to stay grounded. Parker does his best to keep his regular life on check, especially under the eyes of his aunt May (played by Marisa Tomei) and his one friend who knows his identity, Ned (played by Jacob Batalon).<br/><br/>While Parker is stopping an ATM robbery, he notices that the crooks are using high tech weapons and manage to get away. When he encounters them again and tries to intervene, Spider-Man's naivet√© gets him hurt and has to be rescued by Iron Man. Parker manages to trace the weapons back to a salvager/engineer Adrian Toomes (played by Michael Keaton) who has used a combination of alien and Stark technology to build himself a set of mechanical wings to become ""The Vulture"". Can Spider-Man impress Stark when he attempts to stop these guys and keep up his high school image?<br/><br/>I'm pleased to say that the title of ""Homecoming"" is exactly what this story stands for, as Spider- Man has made a well adjusted return to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story made the right decision to take the character back to high school to show us a different Spider-Man; one that's more vulnerable and likely to mess up. Seeing this has made me realize just how overly-perfect the Sam Rami and Mark Webb movies were in portraying the web-slinger. It's not a bad thing, but I think people are going to relate to this Spider-Man more then they did for Tobey Maguire or Andrew Garfield. <br/><br/>Speaking of which, how was Tom Holland as Peter Parker/Spider-Man? He was really good. He seems to be the first Spider-Man to finally have a good balance between the characters. In fact, he may be the best I've seen at playing Peter Parker, as I felt it was more about him as a teenager rather then a super hero. Michael Keaton makes a nice return to superhero movies (after playing Batman) as a villain. He has a bit more humanity them some of the previous Marvel heroes and your often seeing his side of the story and how circumstance may be the greatest villain of all.<br/><br/>The tone of Spider-Man: Homecoming feels just as young as our Peter Parker. I can't help but feel that they took some cues from Deadpool and made this a bit more playful then your usual Marvel movie. This comes from the constant jokes, a John Hughes-like tone, and an entertaining end credits that make me want to wait till towards the end. I'm glad to say that this is up there with Spider-Man 2 as one of the best. <br/><br/>I'll give this nine Spider wings out of ten. Part of me wishes that Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 was still playing as I would totally see that as a double feature with Spider-Man: Homecoming. But on it's own, it's a fantastic Spider-Man movie that should win over doubters who weren't sure about another incarnation. If he's your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man, then give him a chance."

Michael Keaton should win one for best villain since he has made the Vulture come to life for the audience.

","I love the direction they took the new Spider-Man movie. Marvel has been hitting the right notes with making these movies that can please most comic book fans and general audiences. In this chapter, you get to see Tom Holland play a high school version of Peter Parker in his early days of trying to manage work and play. I wasn't fond of the idea when Marvel released the synopsis at first but I thought the movie went beyond my expectations. I didn't expect that many twists throughout the film and you'll be surprised at some of them if not all of them. They definitely answer a lot of questions on who the characters really are and they pay homage to Millar's ""Civil War"" series and we get to see some familiar faces we haven't seen in awhile once again. There's so much to say but it would spoil the movie! I think Holland did a terrific job playing a young Spidey with plenty of ""grit"" trying to find his right footing as a superhero. Therefore, as any young person would, you witness Peter not making the most rational decisions because he's only 15 years old trying to save New York City! I'm glad they didn't go with the origins route with ""great power comes great responsibility"" format that was done twice already. Although, it is very important for Peter throughout the comics, I'm hoping they touch upon Uncle Ben and this in the next film. Holland does a great job at playing the smart yet socially awkward high school kid. There were certain revealing moments in the movie where you see Tom really show the tension in his face. Also, I really liked the realistic portrayal of a diverse high school that's focused on nerds! I love it! The action was great but you don't see as many cool moves like in the previous Spidey movies. But I get it, he's still working with his ""training wheels"". I loved the supporting cast and you get to see some more Happy Hogan in this film and adore Marissa Tomei as a younger Aunt May....so attractive! But it was such an interesting take to see Michael Keaton play the villain and he really brings the character to life and you ""understand"" where he's coming from. Although, some may argue that Holland isn't the best Spider-Man or Homecoming isn't the best Spider-Man movie, there's something for everyone in the film whither it's the light humor, action scenes, more Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man or to continue the next chapter in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, you'll enjoy the movie and I would definitely watch it again in theaters."

And bring the actress back for two minutes to play pepper or whatever her name is - what a ripoff of just slapping actors in place who are only still famous because they were in ironman. This took six script writers? Hollywood, you are a joke. I want my money back and wouldn't even bother stealing this movie from the pirate bay. Stay away."
"darryl-42069","9","60","113","8 July 2017"," The Spidey movie we all deserve
","The relationship between Sony and Marvel fans is a love-hate relationship. The Raimi trilogy is a love letter to all Marvel fans, but the Webb duo-logy is like a slap- in- your-face breakup scene mostly found in your typical romantic TV series.<br/><br/>Now with Spidey's coming home to MCU, and Sony now collaborating with Marvel Studios, seems like this movie is a apology letter to all Marvel fans. But after dozens of trailers that was said to ""give away nearly everything"" (thank goodness I avoided it), and many TV spots, does this movie deliver what it should be?<br/><br/>The answer: YES they delivered.<br/><br/>Spider-Man Homecoming is easily one of the best MCU movies to date, and the best Spiderman movie in a very long time. At last, finally, our friendly neighborhood superhero has received a good movie of his own, and he deserves it.<br/><br/>Tom Holland was born to be Spider- Man. He was very very good in this movie. Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man is also very good in this movie, he's like the Uncle Ben of the MCU. Also, he's not in every scene, probably had the least screen time of all the main stars in this movie (Nope, this is not Iron Man 4 ft. Spider-Man, it's the opposite). Marisa Tomei as Aunt May is also really good in this movie, and she's not acting sexy and anything, she's just a normal, everyday woman. The guy who play Ned is a great comic relief, and Liz who is Peter's crush is also really good in this movie. Michael Keaton as the Vulture is one of the best MCU villains so far (on par with The Winter Soldier). He has more depth than I thought. At battle he's merciless, ambitious guy, but when he's not the Vulture, he's a hardworking, normal, everyday guy, and that gives us more sympathy to him. The biggest surprise in this movie is Jon Favreau as Tony's bodyguard. His role is much more expanded in this movie and he did a great job. Pepper Potts is back, and despite brief it's such a great moment in this movie, and it's good to have her back, even for just a minute or so screen time. Chris Evans as Captain America is one of my favorites in this movie, and probably one of his best on screen appearance in a MCU movie so far.<br/><br/>The story of the movie is much more light-hearted than most MCU movies right now, plus the exploration about Spidey's journey when he's in high-school (not just glimpses when he's in high-school, a mistake in The Webb duo-logy) makes it more interesting, in fact almost all the scenes in this movie is school related, and that's great. The action scenes is not as explosive as most MCU finale acts, but that's okay considering the light-hearted tone. The twist in the end is amazingly executed. The editing is also amazing, it's funny when it tries to be funny, and tense when it tries to be tense. In fact there's a scene between Holland and Keaton where I had chills on my spine because how intense it is.<br/><br/>However, there's some things in this movie that bugged me. One, there's a lot of penis jokes and adult jokes in this movie. Is it too much? For this kind of movie it seems pretty inappropriate. <br/><br/>Two, The side characters are ""useless"", Ned in particular. He's mostly the thing that hinders Spider-Man for his goal in this movie, to capture this particular guy (Keaton). Most of the time he screw up Peter's attempt to hide his identity, and that became repetitive and that just won't work. Even times when he's shown to be useful, he's only useful for about 5 minutes. The screenwriters should add more to his character. It's not Spider-Man and his ""useless"" friends, Spidey is human, he still needs help from his friends. There's also this Michelle character who's just a stalker like character that's kinda creepy actually, and the bully guy who makes penis jokes makes me want to yell: enough already!<br/><br/>Three, there's no real tension in this movie. There's no life-or- death threat that many lives at stake thing. All this movie has is Spidey trying to capture Keaton's character, and that's it. There's no real danger for everyone in the city, and that disappoints me.<br/><br/>Four, I don't know if it's just me, but this movie has the worst credits sequences of all the MCU. In ""The Winter Soldier"", the credits sequence is visually pleasing along with an amazing soundtrack by Henry Jackman. How about in ""Thor: The Dark World"" where the credits sequence is a handmade painting-like sequences, with a amazing score by Brian Tyler. Or take a look at MCU's latest example: ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"". That movie has a visually impressive opening scenes, along with fourth wall breaking, and a song that's actually really good. In this movie, despite it's visually pleasing, it is accompanied by a very bad, horrible music. It's just really bad to me. The movie seemed rushed so that they had no time to make the credits sequence more ""tidy"" IMO.<br/><br/>The last but not the least, is that's there's. so. much. product placements. Sony and Marvel probably working together with a condition that there will be no more Sony product placements, but Sony still wants to do it. So, who you gonna call? Audi! That's right! When Sony can no longer do it, let Audi do the work for you!! Yaaaayyy!!! (?)<br/><br/>But overall, this is the Spider-Man movie we all wanted to see, and Jon Watts and his crew delivered what's promised. It's not perfect, but it's definitely Sony's best attempt so far. Hands down, the best Spidey movie yet.<br/><br/>Now let's just hope Sony don't screw up Venom..."
"dfdieteman","2","3","3","20 July 2019"," Tom Holland good, most of the rest bad
","Spider-Man's characterization is radically changed in this film, picking up from Captain America: Civil War. Spider-Man is not the Peter Parker of the comics; he's a kid on a leash held by Tony Stark and Happy Hogan. The first tedious hour was painful. Aunt May is a fourth of her age in the comics. But Peter's childishness and the helicopter Stark and Hogan weaken the character. Overall, a disappointment. Michael Keaton is always good. It's a shame the script and direction wasted the talents of Holland and Keaton, and took such nonsensical liberties with Spider-Man's origins."
"StaneSKT","10","91","178","27 June 2017"," Awesometacular!
","With no doubts Homecoming is the best movie about Spider-Man! As distinct Tobey Maguire, who was good as the one behind the mask and acceptable as Peter Parker and Andrew Garfield, who was equally bad in both as a regard, Tom Holland excellent combines school life with his new amploa of superhero.<br/><br/>Most of the time the action develops in the school and shows Peter Parkers everyday life, something that we cannot tell about the rest of the 5 movies. I dare to say, that the selection of all these young actors and actresses is an excellent choice, because everyone are fitting in the story and as distinct from Transformers: The Last Knight where the kids was one of the most irritate thing, everything here was good.<br/><br/>The best Spider-Man movie for sure! The talented Tom Holland recreates character of the famous superhero from the comics world in the best way. He is at the same time ambitious and funny. Things that are part of the origin story in the comics. His suit is the best and as common as the original one, all these special moves and extras are collected in the suit are something brand new for the audience, but only if you can see what is he capable of. The problem with the previous movies is that we always watching the same story, that this time was skipped to make possible for the new and fresh ideas to come.<br/><br/>Before someone start to complaining how this movie is Iron Man 4¬Ö NO, it is not Iron Man 4, the movie is Spider-Man Homecoming and Iron Man is not the big star in this movie. Yes, he is part of the movie but that does not mean, that the story is about him. He is just mentor to Peter in his new adventures. Do not put off because of the trailers, because the movie is more than you can see for these two minutes. The spectator will be surprised while he watches the movie.<br/><br/>Concerning about the main villain, Michael Keaton kill them with the role of Adrian Toomes/Vulture with good known brilliant acting game. In my opinion his composure is presenting in the movie and make him one of the best villains in the MCU.<br/><br/>The first and the second act of the movie are progressively very strong and as we know in this situation usually the third one sucks, definitely cannot say that about Homecoming. The final act is not just as good as the other ones, it's even better.<br/><br/>The movie contains a lot, really a lot of easter eggs, which are really important for the next movie. This is why you need to watch very observing so you can see all of them, but I convince you that you will want to watch the movie at least one more time in the theater.<br/><br/>The best Spider-Man regarding to acting, story, choreography and special effects. After I watched Homecoming I can calmly place the movie as the best Spider-Man, followed by Spider-Man 2 (2004) and Spider-Man (2002).<br/><br/>After the end of the movie you'll definitely want to see Spider-Man in Avengers: Infinity War, Avengers 4 and also in his next solo movie in 2019.<br/><br/>If you are long-standing fan of Marvel you know that you have to stay at your place until the last inscriptions ends, so you can see the two credits, which are very good, but one of them¬Ö Just do not hurry to leave!"

","I'm a fan of the previous 5 Spider-Man movies and as i'm a big fan of the Marvel Universe movies i was sooo sure of a great Marvel version with Spider-Man:Homecoming. Their movies have great stories teamed with outstanding action, a good sense of humour and great character development. I've only disliked one Marvel Universe movie which was one of the early ones and sadly this one joins it now.<br/><br/>It made me really wish SONY had gone and made the sequel to Andrew Garfield's The Amazing Spider-Man 2!<br/><br/>The reasons my friend and i weren't keen on this Spidey movie were....<br/><br/>It felt rushed..<br/><br/>Story didn't flow smoothly..<br/><br/>It felt kinda pointless..<br/><br/>Scenes felt crowbarred, e.g. Iron Man scenes.<br/><br/>The ""teen"" scenes were long, kinda boring, weren't fun or funny like in all the other Marvel movies.<br/><br/>Aunt May felt like background, unnecessary.<br/><br/>Pointless teen characters like Zendaya's, as if someone said we need Ali Sheedey's character from Breakfast Club in this, unfortunately it was pointless in this.<br/><br/>The film was emotionless and felt nothing towards any of the characters, unlike the emotional progression and connections in the previous Spider-Man movies.<br/><br/>The villain had an underdeveloped screen presence, so his connection to Spider-Man felt threadbare.<br/><br/>Just a shallow and empty experience, and the action sequences couldn't save it sadly.<br/><br/>The whole film just felt like a wasted opportunity.<br/><br/>4/10"

"nmiodrag","10","114","227","6 July 2017"," A perfect 10
","To clarify why I think Spider Man - Homecoming is a perfect 10: they made another genre movie - high school coming of age movie to be precise, but with this they made a true marvel (pun intended). For example, they never tell you ""With great power comes great responsibility"", they show it in a best possible way. Perfect from the first second to the last (and stay till the end of credit roll - there is an important lesson ;-) )..."

The current political correctness corrupted new Spider man too. Peter's school was more like Hillary Clinton's high school visit. unnecessary and forced multi culture, At least find some good actors from other race if you are itching to show multi culture..
Sam Raimi has set ultimate standard for Spider man and this movie is a complete failure to follow it. And of course thousands of light year away from the Spider man of the comics.. This is more of a destruction than a reboot..
I rather watch again trilogy made by Sam Raimi than this crap.."
"tommywahlman","2","12","18","5 October 2017"," More like a Disney movie for kids
","I started to read Spiderman around 1979-80 somewhere there. I am not sure if he already then had finished high school and collage and moved on to university. I remember there were flashes tho of his past now and then. I also remember that his most boring period as i felt was in high school and after he got married, the period in between was the best.<br/><br/>this felt like an attempt of a semi funny Disney movie for kids where spider man or peter were squealing like a little girl during most of the time. i get that in this movie he is a little kid, but still he even in this age are supposed to be extremely strong, flexible almost impossible to hit cause of that and his of course famous spider sense that is totally forgotten.<br/><br/>I am not to keen on how they mix the original stories in with new, i felt it was pointless to drag in Ned Leeds into this ( its for us who read the magazines, to recognize the familiar caracthers ) as he was a journo at daily bugle much later and got involved in the hobgoblin mess which later got him killed.<br/><br/>Same with Iron Man and Tony Stark which although where mentioned now and then back in the days of the magazines, didn't figure much into the spider man stories. those heroes who popped up now and then was daredevil a blind leads a blind and other stories, punisher ( although as a villain )the Torch and Captain America.<br/><br/>i bet that when they bring the black cat into the picture they will focus on the most boring story as well, with the romance as always. <br/><br/>I do understand to make it movie worthy things needs to be changed although i do think many spider man stories are good as they are.<br/><br/>This vulture didn't feel like the vulture but more of a cross between Iron man and the arch angel.<br/><br/>Sorry this movie wasn't for me, it was a disappointment"
"drawlife","9","50","93","7 July 2017"," Welcome back Spider-Man, welcome back.
","I loved Spidey's introduction in Captain America: Civil War, but maybe ten minutes into Spider-Man: Homecoming there is a montage where Peter Parker is doing his Spidey stuff around NY after school with Blitzkrieg Bop playing in the background, and it was at that moment, I finally felt like Spider-Man is truly home.<br/><br/>Sitting through origin stories can be a chore, and here Kevin Feige, Amy Pascal, writers Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley, and director Jon Watts don't let the audience relive that familiar tale. They drop us right in the middle of it and it's relentless in proceeding the story from start to finish in a good way. It's a long movie, but it's fast paced and a joy to sit through. They do a great job juggling multiple story lines and it never felt jumbled or hard to follow. <br/><br/>The world ending trope is not evident in the film, its a more scaled down adventure, similar to Ant-Man. There are as many high-school/John Hughes scenes as there are with the action sequences. Easter eggs in the film are subtle and great fun, they're not as distracting as one would expect them to be. Also, for the record I can watch Captain America PSA's all day. <br/><br/>I said back in my Captain America: Civil War review that within ten minutes of screen time, Marvel Studios does exactly what Sony failed to do with their last three Spider-Man films. Tom Holland is terrific. He flourishes in this role and I can see that he gave it his all. His charisma oozes off screen and in the scenes where things get serious he's able to show off his acting chops. He's impatient, energetic, a bit naive and super young. I yearned for high school Spidey in films and finally we have continuing stories that take place in high school and an actor who looks the part, and doesn't look old. Holland combines the best of both Maguire and Garfield, with a bit of Michael J. Fox's Marty McFly, resulting in what I think is the best film iteration of Peter Parker/Spider-Man to date. <br/><br/>So far in Phase 3, every Marvel villain felt like a step forward. While they didn't solve their villain issues, they made small steps to fixing it with each Phase 3 film. Here they finally deliver. Of all villains The Vulture is easily one of the MCU's best villains on film since maybe Loki and Winter Soldier. Michael Keaton delivers, and what makes his performance so great is that he plays it subtly. It's not over the top, it's muted, and more low-key. As someone who owned a business trying to clean up after the mess the Avengers leave all over the world, Damage Control and Tony Stark took over, leaving him nothing. He turns to the life of crime, picking up leftovers from any superhero battles, turning them into weapons to sell on the black market with his crew so he can get by living life and providing for his family. That is a motivation I can get by and understand.<br/><br/>He has great exchanges with Holland throughout. One of my favorite moments in the film is when and he tells him that he's young and he just doesn't understand how the world works. This got me thinking, if this were an older Peter Parker, he'd probably understand where he's coming from and they would maybe be having a different conversation. <br/><br/>The supporting cast are terrific. I don't really need to elaborate Downey Jr. at this point. He always brings it every time. Stark is used effectively and for those worried that he might overshadow Spidey, he really doesn't. As shown in the trailers, Stark ridicules him for being ignorant during the ferry incident and it's nice to see Tony Stark in a mentor role giving him only new things to do. Great to see Favreau back as Happy Hogan and he gets some good moments throughout. Marisa Tomei is not the typical Aunt May we see in the comics or in the other Spider-Man films. She's more involved and kind of a cooler, hip aunt. The film also has fun with the fact that she is a very attractive woman. Keaton's crew in the film are also good, they don't have huge roles, but they have something to do in the film. The film treats them as characters as opposed to disposable henchmen for the most part. <br/><br/>The kids in the film are also fun. Jacob Batalon is Ned, Peter's best friend and they're a hoot. The budding romance between Peter and Liz is also well done and not overplayed. Laura Harrier does a good job projecting a personality of a popular, but friendly and humble girl. Zendaya also scores some decent laughs as a rebel student similar of Ally Sheedy's Allison Reynolds from The Breakfast Club. Tony Revolori is a different incarnation of Flash Thompson. Being a comic-book conservative, in truth I was let down by the fact that we wouldn't get something similar of Chris Zylka's Flash from the Andrew Garfield series, but after digesting everything Revolori was quite good and the new approach they took won me over. <br/><br/>Occasionally the film stumbles a tad, for instance Ned can get a little too annoying at times. Some of the cgi effects didn't look as polished as I had hope, but it's not distracting where I'd be taken out of the film. Tonally, having Peter Parker actually enjoy being Spider-Man brought a breath of fresh air. That in it of itself is the best thing about Spider-Man: Homecoming. It's a colorful adventure that fits with the rest of the MCU without getting bogged down with franchising. He's home and it's good to have him home. <br/><br/>9.5/10"

"Skaigear","9","47","87","9 July 2017"," Fun, earnest and dramatic, Homecoming stands on its own two feet in a genre full of end of the world climaxes and world-building expositions
","Spider-Man: Homecoming is the fifth live-action Spider-Man movie and the first iteration to take place in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, making it the sixteenth film of that mega franchise. On par with popular opinions, I did not like the two Amazing films that much. I do not hate them like many others do, but I felt gone was the heart that existed in the Raimi films. To say this movie came back with just a faint pulse, is an understatement; Spider-Man: Homecoming wears its freaking heart on its sleeves! Back in 2014, Sony and Disney struck a deal to essentially share the character and allow the Web Slinger to be back in Marvel's hands where he belongs. As evidenced prior by Tom Holland's small but fantastic role in Captain America: Civil War, it was a good move. But witnessing Homecoming's excellence reaffirms it is probably the best decision the two companies ever made.<br/><br/>I love this movie, it was simply marvelous. The film was funny, heartfelt, emotional and a visual delight. It discards the cynicism and ""grit"" found in the Marc Webb's series, and instead makes Peter Parker, a pure, innocent kid who just wants prove his worth and do the right thing. No more moody, Twilight Peter snooping around saying mean things or being angsty, instead we have a protagonist here that is likable and relatable in a genuine way. It also helps that the high school setting was well utilized with a vibe that is completely different from the previous series, as it takes a more realistic, but cheerful approach to its tone and atmosphere. I really appreciated the diversity amongst the cast, it was beautiful to see representation candidly showcase on screen.<br/><br/>Tom Holland was excellent as Peter Parker and Spider-Man, he was funny and witty, but not sarcastic or harsh. Multiple times in the film, Peter is presented a choice to either be a regular kid, stay with his friends and perhaps get the girl or fulfill his duty as a hero and pursue the crime. You can just how torn Holland is with this choice each time through his face. A lesser actor would not have been able to portray this internal conflict this exceedingly well. Michal Keaton as the Vulture was great; he is probably my favorite MCU movie villain thus far, because I bought into his motivation on why he does what he does. I also appreciated they gave him a personal connection to the hero to further the emotional impact. Marisa Tomei as Aunt May was very lovely and my eyes were glued whenever she was on screen as her motherly charm and beauty enchanted me to no ends. God she is beautiful. All the kids here actually behave like real kids and they are all hilarious, especially Peter's best friend Ned, played by Jacob Batalon. He was so natural in his performance, watching the two's relationship unfolded almost made me feel like I am part of the group as well.<br/><br/>Most people go see a Spider-Man film for its action, and rightfully so, Spider-Man 2 has some of the best action sequences in film history to date. Homecoming is pretty exciting and great to look at, and because I did care for Peter and his friends and wanted them to be okay, the action scenes were suspenseful. However comparing it the previous movies, it definitely lags behind just a little bit. It still is visually stunning, but we just did not get a Doc Ock level of excellence here. We do get a great climatic battle on top of an aircraft that ends on an emotional note. I really appreciate this movie taking a smaller approach and not have the climax be a beam-in-the-sky, end of the world scenario like most other superhero movies nowadays. Because it just gets played out, we know the world is not going to end, so unless it really is the last film of a franchise, why keep doing it? It is nice to see the filmmaker's objective here is to display the emotions of the characters and not just trying to one-up the explosions from last big blockbuster.<br/><br/>Homecoming is probably the heartiest MCU film to date. I am big fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, I have seen all sixteen films multiple times. There is one common problem amongst each movie and that is the disservice of dramatic scenes by injecting humor into them at the wrong moments; my emotionally connection with the film is greatly weakened because of this. I think the only movie that successfully avoided this tonal problem in my opinion was Ant-Man and the first Iron Man. You can now add Spider-Man: Homecoming to that list because this movie juggles the balance between humor and drama perfectly. Using the natural charm of the cast, the jokes land on target at the correct moments when they are supposed to, and because of good character development, the dramatic scenes also flourishes in genuine fashion since they are not diffused by humor.<br/><br/>Overall Spider-Man: Homecoming is now my second favorite movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and probably my third favorite Spider-Man movie behind the second and first one. I am glad to see it correct many of the tonal problems I had with previous movies like Doctor Strange and Amazing Spider-Man 2. Fun, earnest and dramatic, Homecoming stands on its own two feet in a genre full of end of the world climaxes and world-building expositions. No matter what happens in this universe moving forward, it will always be smaller movies like this and Ant-Man that will have the biggest impact on me because they understand it is not about the punch, but the emotion behind the punch that matters."

And I thank God that we have a talented director like John Watts,he cares about making the side characters and the villain interesting which to be honest the MC failed at making me care for the side characters and villains. Speaking of the villain I'm proud to say that Michael Keaton gives on of the best performances I have ever seen doing and one of the best MC villains and one of the best comic-book movie villains. This movie has lower stakes compared to other MC movies but,this is what makes it bolder the many comic-book movies is that it's not afraid to be small-scaled and director John Watts does not compromise the small scale of the movie just for some cheap action scenes with explosions,in conclusion I would like to say that Spider-Man homecoming is the perfect Spider-Man experience and the best Spider-Man movie filled with heart and humor 10/10."

"randyfromscream","7","36","65","7 July 2017"," Let's stomp The Amazing Spider-Man 1 & 2 this is the best Spider-Man reboot ever.
","This is a good reboot like I'm not saying this film is better than Sam Raimi Spider-Man films like I still like them movies. I think Tom Holland did a good job as Peter Parker / Spider Man just like Tobey Maguire. At least we didn't need another origin story like we have one like 15 years ago so we already know what happen. At least they have the Vulter just like what Sam Raimi want since Spider-Man 3 (2007) and the Shocker is on the big screen like it sucks he didn't get a lot of screen time but his acting is good. I think the one YouTube Poop video like what Flash Thopson said to Parker when he said to him (I don't know of the word is O.K to say so I'm censoring it) P***s Parker because it's funny to the writers. At least the villains in this film didn't suck like The Amazing Spider- Man (I'm not going to be talking about how this film is better than TASM films). Good film, recommend to watch and that's all I'm going to say. 7.8/10"
"The_Crow18","1","25","43","7 July 2017"," Could and should have been better.
","This is the 3rd introduction we have of Spider-Man when it comes to the cinematic universe in 10 years period and it seems like the character lost a bit of it's charm in creativity in trying to reinvent itself and continue to come back to the same old formula. But this time, Marvel's name and ""creativity"" is attached to it. And that is enough to make people think it's the best thing that happened to it...Sadly, there isn't much of improvement. <br/><br/>May contain some *spoilers*<br/><br/>The film may have said that it is focusing on Peter evolving as Spider-Man and making him that he is already Spider-Man by skipping the origin story, but it's not really true. The film seems like an origin story with skipping the Uncle Ben's death subplot. <br/><br/>The setting in high-school is well felt and not to take away from them trying in emphasizing that aspect a bit more, but do we really need him again in high-school? does it contributing anything to the story other than financial gain (yonger actor = more movies = more money). The fact is that he spent only two years in high-school in the original comic run and the story is much more focus on him as an adult, having adult problems, while being Spider-Man and him trying to navigate between all of that. Now, why do I mention all of this? Because setting him up as a kid limit him as a character and limit the appeal for larger demographics when it comes to viewers. The film is very much ""kid friendly"", much more than it is an ""adult friendly"". I understand it is easier approach to make him bland in the MCU, but good writers could have easily figured out how to do that when it more mature and already an established as a superhero and make a film focusing on these points and how he fits in.<br/><br/>They continued to say this film is an homage to John Hughs style and films, and the film does have a few winks at it, but other than that it just fell flat and never once reminded any of Hughe's brilliant material. John's understanding when it came to teen angst and their personal problems made his films to be remembered as they do. He understood his characters and how to develop them. These were also simpler times with larger inner search issues that teens had, and they were far more relate-able to the current take of the current generation and how to approach these issues. The characters are very one dimension, there's hardly any progress with them, even though many of them get a lot of screen time , there is very few progress with their characteristics and development and they are just there because the setting of the film required them to. In no shape or form this film ever felt like an tribute to John Hughes work, and felt more like a TV show in the Disney channel. It takes more than show ""Ferris Buller's Day off"" in the background, Jon Watts. <br/><br/>Let's talk about diversity in this film and how much it is forced in every film nowadays just to please minorities and have very little sense behind it when it comes to casting and how the characters should be portrayed. <br/><br/>The characters here are drifting far away from how they are and look in the comics, and I'm all up for it when it comes from the right reasons, writing, and fits well with the plot. But here, it just felt forced and out of place and they completely changed all of these characters (Liz Allan, ""Michelle"", Flash Thompson, Vulture, Shocker). They're making this casting debate as black and white without anything in between to whoever disagrees with them. But it was never about people not wanting diversity, but people wanting it to be felt much more natural and that the characters and story will fit well with the source material. <br/><br/>Michael Keaton pretty much steals the show in every scene that he is in. Downey, and the rest of the adult cast, is doing far better and the best they can from the very little that the script allows them to, as opposed to the younger cast. But honestly, it's not because the direction and writing were top notch that it made these actors shine above, but because these are brilliant actors, that have much respect for their film and project they are working on and it shows. Keaton is doing great and he is probably the best villain since the great Raimi series. Minus Topher Grace. <br/><br/>The visuals are great, and it really is a big improvement over the lacking ones we had in ""The Amazing Spier-Man"" dualogy. The swinging are great and they really trying to show and emphasize different part of the characters and his powers when it comes to the fact to how Spider-Man can swing when there's nothing to swing to or from? Well, he just have to run. And it's more difficult as it sounds. Or the fact that it even with his super fast reflexes and flexibility is still not enough when you climb a really really tall building. <br/><br/>I was bothered by the fact that they completely forsaken his spider sense which is one of the character most familiar strengths, and really having him lean on this high tech suit, and have his character completely dependable on it and Tony Stark. It worked shortly in ""Civil War"" introduction, but here it is stretched through the entire story and film and from an independent, smart, well capable character, he became a needy, eager to please Mr. Tony Stark. And it gets beyond tiring after a short period. <br/><br/>Here's hoping that the next one will learn from these mistakes and make a far better, more intense, more relate-able story to the character."

"GomezAddams666","10","33","59","4 July 2017"," Here comes the Spider-Man.
","It is so hard not to reveal key details when you are extremely excited because all your cinematic dreams have come true in one single movie.<br/><br/>I have grown up admiring Peter Parker, I have seen every single Spidey movie in the theater and some were better than others, but I always felt they were just interpretations of the character, like something was missing there. But this new movie has given us THE Spider-Man we all grew up reading about.<br/><br/>Tom Holland was born to play the web crawler, he is so sincere when he plays both his strengths and his weaknesses, because there is no Spider-Man without his weaknesses and tribulations. This is what made him different from the get-go, Spidey has always been someone with the weight of the world on his shoulders whether o not he is wearing the suit, and Holland is so credible as Parker I will dare to say he is the best casting decision in the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe.<br/><br/>As for Michael Keaton he makes Adrian Toomes/The Vulture a scary character, Keaton is a great villain but most important he makes Toomes human, not a cartoonish villain,but a real human being who has the same anger at the world that some of us have had, you can actually understand him as a person. He is by far one of the best MCU villains so far.<br/><br/>For those who thought this would be an Iron Man movie, I have to say it isn't. Stark's involvement is key to the plot but this is definitely Tom Holland's movie.<br/><br/>The supporting cast was great, they all did an amazing job at creating this world where our new Spider-Man lives, the FX were amazing, it had nice pacing.<br/><br/>Jon Watts had promised to give us a John Hughes type movie, and he has delivered astoundingly, he gave us the REAL Spider-Man. Without a doubt I rate this 10/10, this is one of the best Comic Book Movies I have ever seen, and the best Spidey movie so far.<br/><br/>I am happy to say that as a life-long fan I am overjoyed with this film, and I hope Holland plays the web crawler for years to come, because remember that to him, life is a great big bang up. Wherever there's a hang up. You'll find the Spider-Man."

""We'll call you,"" Tony tells Peter as he's dropping him back home.<br/><br/>Eager to prove his mettle as a full-time member of the Avengers, Peter thirsts for action, taking down bike thieves, helping the elderly with directions and tackling hoodlums like Aaron (Donald Glover).

","First of all I had to say I really have high expectations to this film, but the trailers did really ruin it for me, the trailers did almost show the whole movie itself. But for me it didn't feel like a Spider-man/Iron-man movie.<br/><br/>Lets start first with the character, Tom Holland portray Spider-man and Peter Parker really well he's probably the best Spider-man yet, Michael Keaton did a good job on portraying the Vulture, and the other characters were also good, they did a good job on casting.<br/><br/>The Film is kinda boring, the pacing slow but its not that bad, the film is more of a lighthearted movie than the others its more of a movie for teens but has fun moments for the adults specially for comic books fans, its has a teenage-ish feel but its okay<br/><br/>the action was not that bad but its not as exciting as the action in Sam Raimi's Spiderman 1 & 2, i thought it there will be more action scenes, but what you see in the trailers is what you get<br/><br/>It also didn't feel like a Marvel movie, it's so different from the others, it feel like more of a Disney TV movie with a taste of marvel in it (THIS IS JUST MY OPINION) but hey it's Fun and visually appealing movie, this movie is basically introducing Peter Parker on how he became the spider-MAN and introducing him in the avengers<br/><br/>overall this was above average movie, its GREAT!!!"
"Alondro","10","31","55","17 July 2017"," Finally!
","Not absolutely perfect... but so damned close, I might as well just stick the 10 on there.<br/><br/>I agree with not regurgitating the origin story again. Not only does practically everyone on Earth over the age of 10 already know it by heart, but the story for the movie really didn't need it; those little blurbs here and there were enough.<br/><br/>Not only was Tom great as Peter/Spidey, the perfect bumbling but good-hearted nerd trying to find his place in the world and how he should behave as a young superhero, but the supporting cast was wonderful.<br/><br/>And Keaton as the Vulture... FANTASTIC!! He could be totally menacing and yet understandable, and even at the end still held a slight shred of honor despite all he'd done.<br/><br/>Say... do you all realize that every superhero fic Keaton has been in, he's had wings? Batman, Birdman, now the Vulture... I'm seeing a pattern here! It was incredibly humorous, had great heart, great characters, and it managed to tie into the developments of ""Civil War"" without that story overriding this movie's individual tale.<br/><br/>Plus, the lesser (though still quite tense and potentially devastating) stakes were perfect for an up-and-coming superhero.<br/><br/>Ah, I can't really say anything more without spoiling things, and this is one movie where you really don't want anything exposed before your first viewing. It's simply a glorious superhero movie experience, one of the best of the best Marvel has made thus far."

"j_forbesy","9","52","98","5 July 2017"," Spider-Man: Homecoming Review
","Spider-Man has been one of my favourite superheroes of all time. While many grew up on the old Batman or Superman films, Rami's Spider-Man trilogy was my superhero films. And while now I see flaws in the third installment, the first and second still stand as not only two of my favourite superhero movies of all time, but my favourite movies of all time. <br/><br/>Spider-Man Homecoming does something different to the other Spider-Man films and they absolutely nailed it. Previous films have had most of the focus around Peter being Spider-Man while also being a student. Homecoming flips this. We see Peter as a student who just happens to be Spider-Man. By far this was my favourite aspect of the film. Marvel have continued the trend of diving into new sub-genres. Because of the high school aspect, this movie is very much a coming of age story where previous ones have been mainly an origin story. Due to this coming of age angle, I feel that we know Peter more as a character than we ever have before and less of just the guy who is behind the mask.<br/><br/>Despite a lot of focus going on Peter himself, I still think they did a great job of fleshing him out as Spider-Man. As we know from the trailers, we see Peter learning to use his new suit and I feel like they played those scenes really well being not only does it show Peter at times feeling out of his comfort zone with the suit, but you see him as a character feeling out of his comfort zone being a superhero.<br/><br/>Humour is something we have come to expect from Marvel movies and this movie was no different, however I thought they really changed it up. While there were still the quips and one liners, being a movie that is centred around high school life, they had high school humour. The jokes the students were telling were different to the types of jokes a teach would tell. In many ways, it felt a though a high schooler had written the jokes for this movie. There was puns and play on words and a touch of that immature humour that we wouldn't get in any other movie where an adult is the main focus.<br/><br/>Moving onto the cast, I thought they were all fantastic. Tom Holland is officially now my favourite Spider-Man. While much of the reason why is because of the writing and the story around it, I felt that he really nailed the Peter aspect of the character as well as being suited to being the fast talking, quipy Spider-Man. The return of Jon Favreau as Happy was very well suited to bounce of Holland's Parker. Jacob Batalon, Laura Harrier, Tony Revolori and Zendaya all nailed their specific roles as high schoolers in Peter's life.<br/><br/>I really need to take the time to talk about the two big names of this film, Michael Keaton and Robert Downey Jr. Firstly, I thought Michael Keaton was amazing. It's not often that we come out of a Marvel movie and the villain is one of the stand outs but in this case he was. While much of the credit goes towards the writing and backstory of this villain, Keaton was able to portray the emotion and presence needed to sell us on the Vulture. Secondly, any fears people had about RDJ being a massive part of this film will be brushed away. I wasn't specifically keeping count of how many times he appeared, but his total number of scenes but it would have been no more than maybe 5 or 6. What really worked with those scenes were that story wise, it made sense that Tony was there. Tony is very much the father figure of Peter and I think RDJ really nailed that role, considering that this is a side of Tony we haven't seen a lot of.<br/><br/>Like most Marvel movies, they are filled with easter eggs. I in no way consider myself close to a Marvel expect, but there was quite a few that I picked up on which makes me feel like there are going to be so many more that I missed. Most of the eggs are off handed references amongst dialog or in the background that don't take away from what is happening in the scene.<br/><br/>There are two reveals/twists that his movie has which I thought were both great. One of them many people already assume is going to be revealed in some way, however there is another that completely caught me by surprise. What is most important about that reveal is it up the stakes level for the third act. It got you more invested because you knew that what was going on means so much more than it did before.<br/><br/>While I do have a few problems with the film, I think most of them is just personal expectations I had going into it, rather than straight forward film problems. Personally I would of liked to have seen a bit more of Donald Glover, Marisa Tomei and Hannibal Buress, but I understand why they were pushed aside for the most part in this story. On the flip side of that though, I think both Glover and Tomei are going to play a role in the future of Spider-Man in the MCU so that gets me excited for the future.<br/><br/>Overall, it's hard to say where this ranks among the other Spider-Man films for me. I know it rates above many of them, but only time will tell if it will overtake the first 2 Rami films. However, this is still an amazing movie that I know I am going to revisit time and time again.<br/><br/>9/10"

"jacobslovak","9","50","94","6 July 2017"," The best Spider-Man actor yet
","Firstly, I would just like to express how happy I am about them getting the high school aspect of the story so right. Being a 15 year old sophomore myself, I can definitely appreciate how hard some of the responsibilities and challenges for a teenager can be. Like talking to girls, getting your homework turned in on time, and dealing with jerks; and Jon Watts NAILED that aspect of the movie.<br/><br/>A lot of people may say that this movie is not intense enough and the stakes aren't high enough, and I can see why. But, the producers and director expressed their interest in pursuing a Harry Potter kind of movie series, and as you know, those movies start off rather lighthearted, and progressively get darker; and I think that will happen in these MCU Spider-Man movies as well. <br/><br/>Going into the movie I also expected to know what happens, due to the ""revealing"" trailers. But, I was surprised at how many secrets they kept, and was truly surprised by some of them as well, so that was a nice experience to have in the theater as well. <br/><br/>Another topic is Iron Man's involvement in this movie. I can tell you right now that it is not a problem. Although he was used heavily in the marketing, Tony is not in the movie too much and does not play a huge roll. <br/><br/>Michael Keaton absolutely killed it as the Vulture, and has played one of the best villains the MCU has seen in a while, due to his heavily relatable motives and intimidating suit and plans. <br/><br/>Overall, this was a good, fun, and refreshing Spider-Man movie that keeps a good good focus on what the character of Peter Parker/Spider-Man is all about. I would definitely say it is AS good if not a little bit better than Spider-Man 2, which up until now was my favorite of all the Spider-Man movies"

"cruise01","9","48","90","8 July 2017"," Pure fun, Tom Holland did not disappoint. May be one of the better Spider-man movies but not Marvels best film.
","The friendly neighborhood Spider-man is back and better than ever. Hearing about another Spider- man movie being rebooted within 15 years after Sam Raimi's films and The Amazing Spider man being the second reboot. The thought of seeing the origin story for a third time would have been exhausting seeing another adaptation of Peter Parker taking the big responsibility of being a hero and witnessing Uncle Ben being killed off. However, Spider-Man: Homecoming takes place after Captain America Civil War and no background story to how Peter Parker became the webslinging hero. Homecoming works well more as a coming of age movie as Peter Parker is going through his sophomore year of high school and wanting to have a bigger purpose in joining the Avengers. <br/><br/>The opening sequence of seeing Peter (Tom Holland) going to Germany and shooting his homemade movie as he is about to be part of that Civil War that Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) invited him too was hilarious. The fun moments with Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) and Peter sharing the same hotel and Happy's assistance to Peter is just hilarious. Peter is still learning about all the features his new spider man suit. Peter is desperate for a big mission and is hoping Tony and Happy will call him to be part of the Avengers. They have been ignoring him and hoping he is staying low on his web slinging and is hoping he just focuses on his side of town and neighborhood without getting the mainstream attention. Peter has been doing the good deeds in stopping burglaries, bike thieves, etc. Until, a group of robbers stealing an atm was using some alien weaponry that is led by Adrian. Adrian Toomes/Vulture (Michael Keaton) and his men were shut down by Stark's damage control company in savaging alien parts/weaponry which he will not stop until he gets what he wants. <br/><br/>Spider-Man Homecoming is a lot of fun from Tom Holland's charming wisecracking humor as the character and seeing his early years as the hero were mistakes happen. He face plants to the ground, slips and lets the bad guys run away. But he is learning as the hero. <br/><br/>The action sequences are fun and Peter's humor throughout would keep you entertained. The Ferrier boat sequence was exciting. Sure, there is a couple of issues with some lighting which I ll come back to discuss. The visual effects were great and colorful. It may not be Marvel's big spectacle action movie which this film is grounded and more about the story and characters growing and learning from within themselves. <br/><br/>There are new characters like Michelle (Zendaya) who is odd and weird but she loves to keep to herself no matter how awkward she is. Happy has more screen time, trying to supervise Peter and hoping he stays out of trouble. Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) is younger than the other actresses in the other movies but she was great as well. Robert Downey Jr. did not steal the show in the movie, were there are glimpses of him reminding Peter that he needs to step down as the hero and avoid causing major trouble. Michael Keaton is awesome as the villain, who will do whatever it takes to get what he wants and his winged suit was incredible. My issue with the film is not big or did not make the movie terrible. Vulture is an awesome villain with a twist in it. It is sad to see that every time he is on screen fighting with Spider-Man. Most of their scenes together is badly lit with the lighting which makes it hard to make out or get excited over. Even the climax of the movie, which was short (shorter than the first Iron Man's movie climax). After all these Marvel movies, you would hope they make a climax that is exciting to see with Spider-Man battling with the villain. But it was slightly a let down. My other issue is Peter Parker's bully such as Flash (Tony Revolori) was unbelievable. The casting choice with him did not make Peter being insulted with name calling feel even realistic. Could have been a better actor picked for Flash. That is a minor issue with the film.<br/><br/>May not be Marvels best movie but surely one of the best Spider-man movies to date. Overall, Spider-Man Homecoming is a really good superhero movie. Direction has that coming of age development with the characters and story. The cast so far was great and Michael Keaton was awesome as the villain. The action sequences were plenty and fun. Could have had a more exciting climax. I definitely recommend the film which is a huge improvement over the last few Spider-man movies. The final post credit scene I found to be useless since it was made for as a joke but the mid credit scene does set up for another."

"SpoodermanDerp","10","47","88","9 July 2017"," The Mischievous Spider-Man
","""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" mixes what was great about the Tobey Maguire era along side the spider-man antics of the Andrew Garfield era to serve up a superhero movie that is the most true as it is fresh to the character ever since 2002's Spider-Man. Everything from the mundane things like Peter missing his web shots, running around in a field without tall structures, failing numerous times before fulfilling an objective, not having a love life yet unlike the previous film, and having the story focus solely on his journey to truly become spider- man is what sets this movie apart from everything that came before. It screams, breathes and feels like what spider-man should've been all these years, a 15 year old coming of age story with some spider-man.<br/><br/>No longer is the time where Peter Parker has already graduated high school and is almost in his adult life. No longer do we need to focus on this love story between Gwen Stacy or Mary Jane. This is a new era for spider-man, in the sense that he's no longer the only hero in the block and he can have other people help him. So the question now becomes, how can Peter Parker still be spider-man in this world of Avengers and countless supers? This is the main arc of the entire film wherein Peter now tries to prove himself as spider-man for Tony Stark. However, at the end, he learns that he doesn't need to prove that to anyone other than himself. This is the nuance this film brings in to the table, a kid who already tries to embody responsibility without needing another speech or death from Uncle Ben. Someone who constantly fails and isn't sure of what he should do in each scenario. A hero with a heart of gold and is vulnerable and still innocent to the things around him. Tom Holland's performance is the most naturalistic and deferential to the character and it shows. He IS the best combination of Peter Parker and spider-man even though you still may like Tobey for Peter or like Andrew for Spidey. Tom's portrayal shows a vulnerable and more heartfelt side to the character that you can resonate with every time he's on the screen. Michael Keaton serves as another addition to the low level and every day man turned villain in the Vulture because of the damage caused once again by the Avengers. The fact that this wasn't an origin movie made us love spider-man more. The first scene with him in the entire film immediately humanized and made him likable already. It goes to show that Marvel truly knows the character and is in safe hands. The scenes where spider-man was alone also were the complete highlights of the film. Despite him already being in this huge cinematic universe where anyone can possibly just show up and help him, the film still backtracks and show profound moments of Peter just being himself, talking to his new found AI friend Karen, or trapped in an unforgiving situation. It even has time to show the John Hughes inspired moments that add more than just ""teenage angst"" or ""old and grown men writing dialogue that they think will relate to teenagers"" type of stuff. The writers knew what they were doing and were able to provide a self-contained, non world-ending and separated yet still attached movie to the MCU much like what Ant-Man tried to do. It was also brilliant that we got to see more interaction between Tony and Peter, where we see more of how Tony reflects and projects himself on to Peter yet he wants him to be better than he ever was. It also feels like a passing on the torch because we know that Tony can only be in the MCU for so long and they need a definite flag bearer. The only gripe with the movie is how some of the side characters are brushed off without any meaningful or considerable act except for a few. Wonder Woman did it remarkably well with its side characters, but then again there is only so much you can do with an already over saturated universe that are already saturated with so many characters.<br/><br/>In the end, this film will probably stand the test of time after all the huge and extravagant Avengers films break out. This will be remembered as the connective tissue that brought some heart to it all.<br/><br/>Verdict: 4/5"

","Garbage just garbage. Why did I not just watched the trailer and spent my 2 hours on something more efficient? It's a kids version, with some love story behind it all and some jokes... <br/><br/>The only reason why this film gets a 3 it is because of production value. Great camera angles and so on and so on. But seriously 7.8 for this. I was expecting some more backstory, not some unnecessary Asian dude, some bully, and Peters big love. The concept sounds good but does not deliver. <br/><br/>And don't get me started by the acting. Cmon he's the NR one role of the movie. He did some good scenes, yeah give him some cred for that. But some cuts were just so socially awkward.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor and skip this movie."
"dangrmk","2","14","22","1 October 2017"," Not marvel's best effort.
","We didn't find Tom believable as Peter Parker/Spidey. RDJ's snarky Tony Stark/Iron Man was spot-on. Michael Keaton was a reasonable casting choice for Vulture. Effects and action was par for Marvel. It's a reboot of the Spider-man story, with the expected trials of a young man trying to balance high school and superhero. However, somewhere in the middle of the film, it felt like the reins were handed over to Nickelodeon. The storytelling lost focus. Maybe Marvel is trying to generate a larger audience by pandering to the 10 to 14 year-old age group. It won't put us off Marvel's films, but it certainly wasn't one of their best efforts."
"philiprcraig","10","40","74","5 July 2017"," I don't normally comment. But this film has amazed me.
","I am a 35 year old guy from Scotland with a degree in digital film making. But I do not fancy myself as a critic. I know how hard it is to start with a white page and create a moving experience. The right ingredients can still create an awful mess.<br/><br/>That is why they call it cinema magic. Many times Hollywood has ensembled the perfect cast, story, director etc. but has totally missed the mark. Batman V Superman could be put on that list. The ingredients were fine, but the magic wasn't there. I really wanted to love that film. I have dreamed about it as long as I can remember. But in that context it was a total failure. Scene after scene I felt let down, betrayed. How could these people just not get it? The lack of understanding in the source material was shocking.<br/><br/>That brings me to Spider-Man Homecoming. My expectations were reserved for this film. I have been let down so often recently. Even from Marvel and Marvel Studios. The Civil War was a bit of a damp squib. Avengers 2 was basically Avenengers in eastern Europe (With robots). The rest of the line-up recently is kind of dull. Don't get me wrong. They are not bad films, they are good films, but they are not great.<br/><br/>Spider-Man Homecoming is; in my opinion, great. From the beginning to the end I was delighted, amused or moved.<br/><br/>Big-budget action scenes are standard fare nowadays, but to give those scenes real purpose and finesse is unique. The limitations of physics; or the local geography, really ground the film in a reality DC films have struggled with. Spider-Man is put in environments where Holland's youthful spirit is forced to mature in front of our eyes.<br/><br/>The characters are fully formed human beings, with passions and flaws which make the whole story more believable. Michael Keaton and Tom Holland are wonderful at giving the protagonist and antagonist purpose. We understand why each is following the path they are on, without the need of explanation.<br/><br/>The story is kept provincial; compared to the usual super-hero smash-a-thon. With Peter (Tom Holland) dealing with neighborhood problems. But we still get the implication that the effects could spread to the wider world, giving a real sense of peril.<br/><br/>Spider-Man Homecoming is a fitting title for this film. That is what it feels like. With all the warmth and memories of an almost forgotten childhood. It feels like coming home"

Michael Keaton also delivered an amazing performance as this movies villain, especially in the last act.<br/><br/>SpiderMan movies have had their fair share of problems over the years, but I feel like I finally it.

","Spider-Man: Homecoming is a coming-of-age superhero comedy that, while often formulaic, is fast-paced and quirky with just enough suspense to balance it all out. Tom Holland is super charming and perfectly encapsulates the wisecracking jokester persona of Spider-Man and Michael Keaton plays a rather scary and riveting bad guy. I wasn't that much of a fan of the supporting characters, primarily the love interest, Liz. She suffers the same fate as Mary Jane in the Sam Raimi trilogy: She's nothing more but an object for Spider-Man to go after. She's not interesting whatsoever; nothing more than a forced plot device. Zendaya got pushed aside for her? Zendaya's character, Michelle Jones was snarky, off-beat and hilarious and much more likable than Liz. Why wasn't she the love interest?"

I like how the scene was executed, you know were the inspiration come from but you don't care you just love what you are seeing, another scene that reminded us of previous movie is the falling elevator, the amazing spider-man 2, the death of Gwen Stacey. <br/><br/>overall this movie is amazing, and it definitely is re-watchable."

","Tom Holland is probably the best and most relatable Spiderman ever and this film is an almost dream reconstruction of the Spiderman franchise. Spiderman seems refreshingly different than usual, nerdy and way stronger than ever before. <br/><br/>For the first time a Spiderman villain is not pathetic or irrelevant and the credit goes not only to Keaton but also the writers to have shaped a memorable anti-hero character. <br/><br/>If you thought this was a childish film... well you are mistaken. If you thought Wonder Woman was the best film of the year, you are mistaken there as well, with two big movies yet to be released, it is too soon to form an opinion. But, I will tell you what Spiderman Homecoming has done, it has raised the bar and now the upcoming films have to compete with this Spiderman masterpiece.<br/><br/>On the hindsight, the film makers have obliterated Spiderman's character building exercise, where in he needs to make irrevocable mistakes as to shape his character in future. The absence of Uncle Ben, death of Peter's parents and the tag-line: with great powers come great responsibilities are missing and might as well affect the character in future endeavors. <br/><br/>Lastly, some films are made in such ways that everything falls right in place in those 2+ hours of screen time.

"Aaron1375","10","59","115","11 July 2017"," Spider-man comes home to the Marvel universe
","I am not going to lie, I really like Spider-man, he is my favorite comic book hero. So, this film could be considered bad by most people, but I am still going to like it. Heck, I even enjoyed the two James Garfield Spider-man films. Here, we have another reboot, but this time it is a bit different as this Spider-man has already been introduced to us in last year's Captain America: Civil War. It also does something different than other superhero stories as we do not have to witness the whole origin thing again! I was relieved as I did not want to see Uncle Ben die again and I do think t hat most of us are pretty familiar with how Peter Parker became Spider-man. This time we are also treated to a fairly upbeat Spider-man film as well. No tragic death after tragic death in this one as this one maintains a more positive vibe throughout. Which is good for me as I had to deal with a very harsh personal tragedy and I really do not care to deal with more, even in film. It is strange that they seem to insist on making Peter Parker younger each time though seeing as how in the main cannon of comics he was maybe in high school briefly at the start as when I was reading it he was in college and working for the Daily Bugle; however, at least the high school he is in is one for more intelligent kids so they at least factor in his intelligence.<br/><br/>The story first starts off during the aftermath of the first Avengers film as a crew that seems to salvage and clean up debris is on the scene. The government takes over though leaving Adrian Toomes (Michael Keaton) and his crew in a very bad state as he put everything he had in this cleanup. He ends up keeping some stuff that they had gotten the previous day and thus he and his gang begin stealing the high tech weaponry. Flash years later and Peter Parker is under the tutelage of Tony Stark, well actually he is under the tutelage of Happy Hogan. He eagerly awaits another mission after the battle with Captain America and he eagerly awaits the end of each school day so he can go out and fight crime which oftentimes takes the form of stopping bike thieves and accidentally stopping people from trying to get into their own car. However, he soon runs into some thieves robbing an ATM using advanced weaponry and soon he will come face to face with the Vulture! He also tries to woe the girl he likes as Homecoming is soon.<br/><br/>This one was a fun movie as Spider-man is in the Marvel universe. So we get some comedy in there and we get some really good action sequences. A minor complaint I do have is that Spider-man's spidey sense did not really seem to play that big of a role in his powers. Tom Holland did a very good job as Spider-man as he looked the part of Peter Parker and he talked the role of Spider-man. I always thought Tobey was a great Peter Parker, but lacked the trash talking ability of Spider-man while Andrew could trash talk, but he just did not have a Peter Parker vibe. Keaton was great as the Vulture, it was cool seeing him in another superhero film and he made a really good villain. They also had the Shocker in this one and I loved his inclusion as I always thought he should have been in other Spider-man films as a secondary villain. They also hinted that the Scorpion may be coming! <br/><br/>So I enjoyed this Spider-man film. I liked it about the same as Guardians Volume 2 which I also enjoyed immensely. Then again, I like comic book films and I like most superheros. There really is not a superhero offhand I can think of that I do not like. I do prefer the Marvel universe over the DC one, but I like DC too. This one had everything one comes to expect from a marvel film as it had good humor and good action. I liked Tony Stark's inclusion in the film and I like how he mentors Peter and is at the same time his same arrogant and off the wall self. It was just a fun film and I really thought it had the spirit of Spider-man within it even though things did not go exactly as they do in the comics. As I stated in my Logan review though, in comics there are different existences and in the Marvel cinematic one Peter is a high school teen who has to balance out his studies with fighting crime!"

I thought there were a lot of suspenseful scenes. Loved the idea of having homecoming for this. Everything came together very well, especially having this be in the marvel universe with the avengers and iron man. There should be lots of sequels and continuation to this story, no remakes at least for a long time."
"ChiefKickingAss","9","26","46","6 July 2017"," It's old and new at the same time.
","As with the previous Spidey flicks, the films doesn't get Everything right. But, mostly, it is the closest to being spot Here are reasons: 1. An actual teenager plays Peter/Spidey. This brings an awesome Kick Ass element to the film. Tom Holland looks like a teen rather than a twenty-something...because he is a teenager. As much as I liked Andrew Garfield (he should have played college age Spidey), Tom Holland brings it home as a true high school Peter/Spidey.<br/><br/>2. In the first Spiderman, Willem Defoe camped it up hard core with delicious villainy. Michael Keaton, as the Vulture, brings sympathy for Adrian Toomes/Vulture at first. Buuuut (no spoilers because I hate them) he gives you a reason to reeeaaally dislike him at the end. Keaton as the Vulture was just balls-out! 3. Without spoiling anything, Ironman and Captain American appear. You've seen Tony/Ironman in the trailers. Nothing new there...maybe:) Finally, there are two end-credit scenes. The first one is heart warming. But, you must ABSOLUTELY watch the second one. I mean, it is paramount that you stay and watch the second one. You will NOT be sorry.<br/><br/>Enjoy! It's Spidey, our favorite webhead! What's not to love?"

","Although teenagers may find this movie more enjoyable, Spider-Man: Homecoming is an excellent addition to the MCU. The acting is great, the CGI is great, the jokes are funny, and the action sequences are entertaining. There are few unexpected plot twists, one of which left me on the edge of my seat for the entire scene. This movie felt like a true spider man movie, because it understood who Spider-man is supposed to be--a superhero who simultaneously deals with ordinary high school problems."
"asb_deutsch","9","25","44","6 July 2017"," Hail the critics and Robert Downey Jr. also
","A moment to rejoice! After a long time the critics are totally in sync with me. Yesterday, I was watching Enemy and 10 days ago I was watching Transformers 5, and both of them sucked badly! But today, I found something refreshing. This is the best Spider-man movie ever made!<br/><br/>I watched Homecoming in IMAX with Laser and it was nice. This resulted in bright images, especially the oceans, projected by dual projectors on the giant 42 feet high, 65 feet wide screen of IMAX, completely using the whole screen with a little of chopping the picture. The images are larger than life, but they don't confuse the eye or strain the vision of the audience. Along with 12000 Watts IMAX proprietary sound system that was used very well for the sound editing!<br/><br/>It may have taken 15 years, 6 movies, 3 different lead actors, 2 reboots but Spidey finally has shown redemption. <br/><br/>Sony's Spider reboot in 2014 was a disaster. From the villain to 3D, every element sucked. This new reboot places the media- hyped and over-rated ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" franchise into the hall of shame.<br/><br/>Spiderman is just a teenage boy..but Tony Stark can convince any one. Even us. In the trailer, he mentions ""If you are nothing with the suit, you don't deserve it!"" The question is: Can Spider-man carry it's own weight in the near future without Iron-man? I mean that he was also utilized in Captain America: Civil War.<br/><br/>Hats off to Michael Keaton from his transition to Batman to Vulture. The best villain after Doc Oct (2004). He also highlights today's situation that since the world has change, so should we. I don't want to spoil the fun, so enjoy watching the movie.<br/><br/>My significant digit score: 8.7/10"

","Really great movie and cast really enjoyed the movie but i wanted to see him training with his suit more. To see him go through all the different abilities his suit had would've been fun if we could've seen him learning them it would be perfect for me. I felt like the villain was a little sloppy because i didn't really feel the danger as you would with other more evil villains. I don't think Michael Keaton did a bad job i just think his role wasn't the best.
But that was the things i didn't like EVERYTHING else about the movie i really liked. The performance by Tom Holland, Michael Keaton and Zendaya was really good it wouldn't have been the same with someone else.<br/><br/>

","Spider-Man Homecoming is a magnificent movie. Tom Holland is the new actor of the movie. The film is very funny and interesting. It is about Spider-Man trying to prove his spot on the Avengers team. The big bad guy who was called the flying beetle, is a man in a suit with advanced technologies that let him fly and many other things.<br/><br/>The other reviews show that people love it and other people hate it. Some reasons on why it was bad was one, the crew ruined the movie and two, the jokes were not funny at all. Reasons that it was good was one, it was very funny two, there wasn't any background story which the author said took a very long time and three, it includes a little bit of Iron- Man.<br/><br/>According to RottenTomatoes.com, 88 percent liked it and the movie's average rating is 4.2 out of 5 which is a really good rating. The website I found this information on was https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/spider_man_homecoming/.<br/><br/>I thought that the movie was terrific. It was better than the other Spider-Man movies. At the end of the movie were two big twists which were very interesting and sort of gave a note that another movie may come out.

"alindsay-al","9","39","73","7 July 2017"," A fantastic more comic accurate spider man film
","With spider-man finally back in the marvel cinematic universe this film was one i was hugely anticipating and I believe that this film completely delivered for a more comic accurate spider-man that we have been missing. The premise of this film is set a few months after captain America civil war peter Parker has gone back to being his neighbourhood spider man. Feeling underutilized and trying to deal with school problems he tries to take down a powerful foe. After his brief but memorable performance in civil war, tom Holland is back as peter Parker and I think he is pretty perfect in this role. He is the young man with a lot of energy trying to find his way in life and it totally fits the role especially when his peter Parker. When he is spider man he nails the humour and likability that is required for the role, he was so much fun to watch on the screen in a role that is perfect for him. The supporting cast is full of heavy hitters Michal Keaton plays Adrian toomes/the vulture in this film and I think he was great in this role. He had a lot of intensity for the role bit also adds a lot of humanity and emotion to his character that makes him kind of understandable and easily one of the better marvel villains. I like many people were worried about Robert Downey jnr's presence in this film as tony stark but he was used brilliantly in this film. He isn't in many scenes but when he is he adds a lot of depth to his growing mentorship and friendship with peter without taking anything away from spider man. Jon favreau reprises his role of happy hogan and he is really funny in this film, but he also has a fun relationship with Peter as he tries to look after him. Marissa tomei plays a younger aunt may and I really enjoyed watching her and Peter's relationship throughout this film, they worked really well together and this is my favourite iteration of this duo. The story of this film is good, I really enjoyed watching peter deal with school as we really haven't seen it in as large a way as it does in this film. It also felt right for peter to feel underutilized as spider man and I really felt for him as a character. However, I do think this film maybe tries to try and cram a bit too much into this film. There is so much going on that such things as the romance and the decathlon he has to partake in falls flat and came across as things I didn't really need in this film. The script for this film is really good, the humour pretty much works across the board with multiple characters having really funny dialogue. The drama in the film also is really good especially towards the end of the film where is is ramped up for a great finale. The style of the film has great fun action scenes in it with some being really unique for this film compared to other spider man films. The film has a pretty lighthearted tone to it but it has action that is pretty visceral towards the end of the film and it was great to watch. Overall this is a spider man film for a new generation and I did love this film which needs to be watch especially if you are a spider man fan."
"yesimr","9","38","71","8 July 2017"," Best movie version of spider-man
","As a movie I would give it an 8/10 but for me personally it's a 9/10. Tom Holland is the best version of Spider-Man/Peter Parker yet. They really do a good job of showing us a Spider- Man that is inexperienced and still learning his new powers but is also very likable and relatable. He's quippy when he needs to be but he also acts like a 15 year old would actually act and makes mistakes sometimes. In the other movies they would usually just show a montage of him learning his powers and he would know things but in this one we are learning with him. As much as I love the older movies I never felt that they were quite able to capture Spiderman correctly. But this movie did. The reason Spiderman is likable is because he is us. He's not a rich Iron Man or a god. Just a regular kid who got superpowers. I felt like this movie really captured that and I can't wait for more movie were we get to see him grow. there were moments were I was really concerned for his safety. That being said there were some changes that this movie made that I liked but I could see others not liking it. One of them being the new suit. I liked it because it seems like something he would get from Iron Man and like I said, Peter is still learning his powers. And I liked That he talked to Karen and gets to unlock new things. Also he can do things without the suit but it's like a bonus. It is different though so I could see why some might not like it I liked that the school is diverse and that's actually what a school would look like. I also didn't mind that Flash was more of an asshole rich kid and not someone who punches Peter or whatever. Usually those are more stereotypical movie bullies I also liked the vulture. He was a menacing villain but at the same time you could see where he's coming from and why he's doing what he does. He's actually similar to Peter in some ways and I really liked that. He wasn't a bland boring villain The only things I didn't like in this movie was I thought that when Peter was stuck in the rumbles he hears Tony's voice AND sees his reflection with the mask. It was a little overdone I could have done without the voice. Also some of the CGI could have used a little more work. My favorite scene was when Spiderman gets defeated by vulture and he is stuck in the rumbles. He cries for help but there is no one there to help him. I felt bad for him and it made me realize that he's only like 15 but has to help himself because there is no one there. It was kinda heartbreaking. Even though that Tony line afterwards was cheesy. Overall I really enjoyed this movie. It was fun and funny with good acting and fun characters. I can't wait to see what's next."
"CANpatbuck3664","9","36","67","8 July 2017"," Spider-Man: Homecoming Lives Up to the Hype With Lots of Humour, Thrills and Great Performances
","*Minor Spoilers Ahead* Peter Parker aka Spider-Man (Tom Holland) is being shepherded by Tony Stark's former head of security Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) to his debut appearance in Captain America: Civil War. He's overwhelmed but as we know, he rises to the occasion and does an admirable job backing up Tony and his team. He's understandably psyched for his next job with the Avengers but Tony (Robert Downey Jr.) has taken it upon himself to mentor Peter and tells him to acclimate and stay low to the ground till he gets another call for his assistance.<br/><br/>Peter does his best to blend in at school but he's facing your average teenage problems on top of fighting crime. He has a crush on Liz (Laura Harrier) who doesn't notice him, he also has to balance getting good grades with synthesizing his web formula in science class. He has his best friend Ned (Jacob Batalon) to help him get through his day to day but his afternoons are spent arresting small time crooks instead of his big battle vs. Cap and Falcon. He also has to hide his identity from his Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) who may not be as oblivious as she's letting on.<br/><br/>Spider-Man coming back to Marvel was a minor miracle and with a relatively inexperienced director in Jon Watts (I'm not saying bad, he's just not experienced with a huge franchise project) it did nothing but ramp up the pressure. But against the odds, I think that this movie succeeded even over other storied entries of the web-slinger's franchise. One of these things is that the characters that they create feel more grounded and relatively easy to relate to. Peter actually feels like a kid in this movie. He's got this wonderful gift that he has to keep secret and it makes the rest of his issues seem trivial by comparison. He's got a good heart and a brilliant mind but he doesn't understand the possible danger in what he's trying to do. Adrian Toomes (Michael Keaton) isn't a cackling super villain, were there easier ways to support his family? Probably. But he's not in it for world domination and he never comes across as completely evil. This movie even grounds Tony as a character further. He tries to project an uncaring aloofness towards Peter but his true paternal feelings become more apparent as the movie continues. I was completely blindsided by this and although Marvel Studios churns out quality blockbuster entertainment regularly, this is a sterling example of good character development even for them.<br/><br/>With Robert Downey Jr. being featured so prominently in the trailers, people were worried about him taking over the movie. I'm happy to report that he's in the movie about as much as he needs to be. He gives Peter someone who can relate to his experience and he also provides much needed guidance. I thought he was used perfectly (more on Downey Jr.'s performance later) and I also thought this movie did a great job of interweaving the larger Marvel universe into it (aside from one or two time-line issues). There are a couple of fun cameos and they bring back certain characters (it was fun to see Happy Hogan again and he gets a surprising amount of screen time) for a fun jog down memory lane.<br/><br/>This movie brings the plot and the character development but it doesn't drag or fall down in any other of the requisite areas. The action scenes move quickly and feature a nice mix of Spidey's abilities (even if we've probably seen better from other Marvel entries). The movie also features a surprising amount of heart. You understand the difficulties of this responsibility for Peter and his mixture of innocence, caring and determination is even inspiring at times. What I didn't expect is that this is probably the funniest Marvel movie I've seen in a long time. We get more than enough comedic relief from Peter's awkwardness, his friendship with an even more awkward Ned and his lack of understanding of his skill set. I was laughing hard through most of the movie and you can't help but enjoy yourself when you're tearing up from laughter.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield both had their strengths and weaknesses as Spider-Man but Tom Holland shows us a new Peter Parker. He was awesome in his first appearance and he continued his great work here. Michael Keaton also does a memorable job, I don't know if he's the best Marvel villain but I would probably put him in the top 5. Jon Favreau was a welcome addition and he was pretty funny throughout. I've always loved Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Ironman and he was his typical great self. Jacob Batalon was hilarious as Ned and strangely endearing. Laura Harrier wasn't given a ton to work with as Liz but she held her own. Marisa Tomei was good as Aunt May and I'm glad the movie had the good sense to address how different she was in this part compared to other actresses in the past.<br/><br/>This movie was everything that I hoped it would be. I got everything I wanted out of it and I left the theatre with a big smile on my face. This movie had a high bar it needed to clear to be successful, with all the pressure and the expectations and I think it hurdled it. I can't wait for the sequel and Spider-Man: Homecoming continues 2017s great run of superhero movies."
"JediKnightNi","10","36","67","8 July 2017"," Quick, to the point - no spoiler

I am amazed and appreciative that Marvel has a formula that works for these films. the characters compliment each other well across films and I could not ask for more.<br/><br/>Spiderman is a character that has endured and become more loved over the years. and the theater I was in this weekend had fans in full force dressed up in costumes and shirts and cheering/clapping/laughing during the film, in a good way.<br/><br/>Thanks again Marvel, next up Thor!"

","If you had told me in 2014 that there would be yet another Spider-Man reboot in 2017 I would've rolled my eyes. While I didn't hate the 2012 and 2014 movies I found them a tad bland and unnecessary so soon after the Tobey Maguire trilogy ended in 2007. But it's another day and another Spider-Man movie has his theatres and I gladly handed over my money to see what could possibly be new this time around. I'm happy to say that it was worth every penny. This was, hands down, my favorite Spider-Man movie and Tom Holland is my favorite Spider-Man. And I liked both Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield.<br/><br/>Peter Parker is your typical teenager dealing with high school, friends, a crush¬Öoh and saving the city from criminals using his alter ego. What I found thoroughly refreshing was the lack of teen angst that both previous Spider-Men dealt with. While they were burdened with the weight of the world, 2017's Spider-Man (more like Spider-Teen) is past that. He's young, and at times naive, but the underlying guilt has been taken away. The movie doesn't dig up the past. Peter became Spider- Man, got discovered by Tony Stark, fought alongside the Avengers, and now struggles with his mundane life. The story is fresh and director Jon Watts keeps it light. Also, introducing the character in Captain America: Civil War was a masterstroke since you go into this movie already knowing the kid.<br/><br/>The film's casting is spot on and wonderfully diverse, might I add. Tom Holland is simply fantastic. He's the ideal young superhero with charm, wit, and a genuine sense of fun. It's not the Spider- Man we're used to and that's a good thing. Jacob Batalon as his best friend Ned is hilarious. Zendaya, who I expected to see in a bigger role, is wonderful as is Marisa Tomei as Aunt May. Though not my favorite villain, Michael Keaton does a fair enough job. I'm excited to see where the story and characters go from here especially after certain facts come to light. Guest appearances led by Robert Downey Jr (Tony Stark) enhance the entertainment value.<br/><br/>A happy Peter, a breezy tone, crisp writing, entertaining side characters, and the connect into the bigger Marvel world all add up to a brilliant start for a new series. The potential is tremendous. While I wait for that to be achieved I'll gladly give this movie another watch. It's that good!<br/><br/>https://stuffiwatchblog.wordpress.com"
"ssrofficial","9","36","67","7 July 2017"," Spider-Man: Homecoming is pure Marvel Cinematic Gold!
","Yes, I can easily call Spider-Man: Homecoming the best movie of this Summer, and competing very hard to be one of the best Marvel movies till date. Let me elaborate on why I think so.<br/><br/>Picking up from where Civil War left off, Homecoming finds our teenage superhero feeling a little bit impatient for he has been pretty much left on the sidelines by his mentor Tony Stark ever since the battle at the Leipzig Airport. Peter wants to be an Avenger at any cost, and stopping street level thugs and petty robberies isn't helping his cause in any way. Unlike the Spidey movies that preceded this one, Spidey is not the only hero in town anymore. So, while Toby's and Andrew's web-slinger and their endeavors were kind of a phenomenon for the city-dwellers, they are a little bit meh for the citizens residing in this reality existing in the MCU , and can you blame them? They have seen Super Soldiers, Demi-Gods, a city invaded by a giant Alien Army and what not. So while a guy swinging on webs and climbing up walls does impress them, it does not make their jaws drop in awe anymore.<br/><br/>Make no mistake, Homecoming is not a movie about a world at peril or anything similarly devastating. Instead, it's a small and grounded adventure with heart. A lot of heart. And that is where Tom Holland shines. I have never seen both Spider-Man and Peter Parker being portrayed so comic accurately on screen. Tom brings out the raw youthful, untrained, underdog side of Peter that we have rarely seen on screen. Peter is a kid(albeit a genius one) and despite being granted these awesome super powers, he is still 15. The movie puts the struggles of Peter's dual life at the forefront more than ever, and stuff like missing quizzes, being a nerd and having a huge crush on the popular girl at school are given as much importance as fighting the big bad guys. The John Hughes influence is clearly seen here. And oh boy, is it funny. While Sam Raimi and Marc Webb's version did provide an occasional chuckle here and there, this one is a laughathon from the beginning till the end. Be it the awkwardness of Peter Parker or him dealing unsuccessfully with his new suit(Training wheels off!), or the amusing antics of best friend Ganke.. oops.. Ned Leeds(Jacob Batalon), the smiles stick to your face almost throughout the whole of the movie.<br/><br/>But be prepared to feel your happy face turn upside down by the menace of the new baddie in town, yes, I am talking about The Vulture. This is a guy whose livelihood gets almost Damaged indirectly by Tony Stark, and resorts to dealing in illegal weaponry made out of Chitauri Tech to provide for his family, in the process becoming the scary looking big mechanical winged bird guy known as the Vulture. Micheal Keaton hits this one out of the park, what with one of his most menacing portrayals till date. We cant call him downright evil, since he is only doing this to make the lives of his daughter and wife better and knows that he has to work hard for his gains since he hasn't got the luxury and the frills that come with it like Tony Stark has. He is not into the whole ""Grrr, I hate Spider-Man, I will kill him at any cost!"" gig that most Spidey baddies are into, instead he just wants to go about his job without any interference. Hell, he even gives Peter the chance to walk away from this and pretend that it never happened. He is not anti-social, since he has a pretty healthy family and a seemingly normal life. But to see the real menacing side of him, sit tight for that awesome face to face confrontation just before the Homecoming dance(Oh, so many spoilers right there, but my lips are sealed for now!) His restraint in killing Peter time and again, despite having the means and opportunity to do so speaks volumes for the complexity of Adrian Toomes is, but Peter does pay his debts off at the end(Oops, again spoiler territory). <br/><br/>Both Jacob Batalon and Zendaya play the parts that are required of them absolutely perfectly.. Pay a little more attention to Zendaya though, her character, though having a short turn in this movie, has more than what meets the eye, I liked Tony Revolori's new take on Flash Thompson, since he is the modern day bully , being only a minor annoyance to Peter rather than a douche, in fact he is no idiot at all since he has his IQ points set pretty much on the above average scale(Come on, he is on the Quiz team!).<br/><br/>Marisa Tomei has so few scenes in this movie. She is the cool aunt everyone loves and props up every now and then to give a bit of motherly guidance to Peter and that's it. She has no where close to the emotional impact Rosemary Harris had in the Raimi films.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr is his usual self and whizzes through his scenes with a charm that only he can conjure. <br/><br/>So, to summarize, Spider-Man:Homecoming is one good movie. It's funny, it has charm and wit, and a protagonist having a flair seen never before in this aspect,making the role of the wall crawling, web-swinging superhero his very own. As of today, Tom IS the definitive Spider-Man/Peter Parker I wanted to see on film since forever and it's a joy to know that he have a bigger part in the MCU for many more years to come. Do not miss this movie for the world, in fact after the end credits roll, you will be tempted to give it another watch.<br/><br/>Psst.. The mid credits scene is a doozy¬Ö Don't miss it!"
"tankace","9","36","67","7 July 2017"," On par with the first two Spiderman films.
","Spiderman Homecoming is the sixth film featuring our friendly neighborhood Spiderman and his first solo film in the MCU and I have to tell it right now to pull out of my chest, it is on par with the first two Spiderman films.<br/><br/>Now to the film itself ,no spoilers of course we follow our high school hero as he tries his best to be a superhero and at the same time have a functional life as a student, good luck with that. At the same time we follow Adrian Toomes the antagonist of the film portrait by, let's face it a legend of the superhero community, Micheal Keaton aka the Vulture. What I like about this film is that we see how the effects of the actions of the Avengers in the world and something that now should be expected by the inhabitants of this world, get use to the superheroes, yes a new superhero is a interesting news, but not world changing as the world has already changed. <br/><br/>To our new wed-sling-er, Tom Holland is excellent in his role and I loved seen him try to be a hero with various level of success, what did you expect he is a teenager, he is new in this game unlike Iron-Man ,Captain or Thor ,who have years or in the case of Thor centuries of experience, so his attempts are the predicted by a youth trying to get in to a grown up game. Also they nailed his nerd persona and over all difficulty to socialize in to his environment. And as for the subject how is the best Spiderman ,well for me they are both number 1 I can't and I won't decide. <br/><br/>As for Micheal Keaton ,well he was quit good and this Vulture though differed greatly from the one from the comics and animated series, he was a good first villain for our new hero. This Vulture reminds me an pitch from What-culture for this character and I have to say if the creators of the film watched that video and though to apply some of the ideas in it, then awesome. <br/><br/>As for Iron-Man he isn't much in the film, however here has taken the role of a father-mentor figure. Which was both funny and interesting as some years prior if someone saw Tony Stark he would say ""that is a terrible idea"" now after the Avengers films and Civil War it was ,in my opinion, the natural progression of his character as now he and in general the original Avengers (Captain America, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Iron-Man, Thor and Hulk) have to take responsibility for the new heroes who have take inspiration by them (Scarlet Witch, Ant-Man and Spiderman, Vision doesn't count). <br/><br/>The action is nice and creative ,nothing more. As for the jokes, well placed and in great quantity and quality. <br/><br/>My last praise is the portrait of school life. It was great and though the cursing was missing (not at all, but it was minimized) the director and writers showed, they have a clue of how the mind of young person works, for further clues, go watch Cop Car.<br/><br/>My issues now are, that it had some repeats from previous Spiderman films, the action as I said is good but not excellent and finally set up for future films. OK I now it is a shared universe and but I am starting to getting sick from the set up Marvel ,don't over do it , just sick to make good films ,as you do, and the audience will come.<br/><br/>Over all it was a great experience and a solid introduction to the A class films of Marvel who are up to now (my view here): Iron-Man, Avengers, Winter Soldier, Guardians of the Galaxy, Avengers Age of Ultron, Civil War ,Guardians Volume 2 and Spiderman Homecoming."
"ericrnolan","9","35","65","9 July 2017"," A review of ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" (2017)
","""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" (2017) isn't a bad movie. To the contrary, it's a very good one ‚Äî I would even rate it a 9 out of 10, if a little reluctantly.<br/><br/>The action, humor, surprises and special effects are all top-notch; it's got a slew of fun Easter eggs and great continuity within the Marvel Cinematic Universe; and Michael Keaton hits it out of the park as the story's villain. (As Ed Harris did recently with HBO's ""Westworld,"" the sublimely likable Keaton really surprised me with how he could become so intimidating.) Furthermore, the screenwriters wisely omit another redundant re-telling of the web- slinger's origin. (Even a die-hard fan like me is sick of seeing or reading about it.)<br/><br/>I think your enjoyment of this movie might vary according to what you want Spider-Man to be. This isn't a movie in which Peter Parker or his alter ego stand out as his own man (despite its plot resolution's heavy-handed efforts to tell us that). I submit that it's fairly undistinguished as a standalone superhero film ‚Äî it feels like an ancillary, companion film to the ""Avengers"" movies, including last year's de facto installment, ""Captain America: Civil War."" Indeed, fan-favorite Tony Stark is ""Spider-Man: Homecoming's"" most significant supporting character ‚Äî far more than any of the many friends, family, love interests or villains that have long inhabited the iconic hero's mythos. Peter's primary motivation throughout the movie is his desire to become an Avenger, like a normal kid would aspire to the varsity football team. Many of his powers stem from a ultra-high-tech costume designed and given to him by Iron Man; it even has an advanced A.I. that is a femme fatale equivalent of J.A.R.V.I.S. (Fun fact: that alluring voice belongs to none other than the alluring Jennifer Connelly. The actress is the wife of Paul Bettany, who is the voice of J.A.R.V.I.S. and then the actor portraying The Vision. And Connelly herself played the love interest of 1991's mostly forgotten ""The Rocketeer,"" a World War II-era hero with the a similar character concept to Iron Man.)<br/><br/>I was a big fan of Spider-Man in the 1990's, and, believe me, the ol' web-head did just fine with his own powers, intelligence and character ‚Äî and without any sort of ""internship"" with Iron Man, either metaphorically or otherwise. He was also a far more popular character with readers. I was buying comics regularly between 1991 and 1996 ‚Äî while Spider-Man books and merchandise were everywhere, I don't think I ever remember seeing an ""Iron Man"" comic on the racks at my local comic shop. I kept thinking inwardly of Spider-Man during this movie as ""Iron Man Jr.,"" and, for me, that wasn't a good thing.<br/><br/>I also found myself musing during the film that this felt like ""Spider-Man Lite."" While ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" was fun, it doesn't have the depth, character development or gravitas of the Sam Raimi trilogy. (Yes, I even liked the third one, despite its bizarre flaws.) I know that critics are praising the movie's lighter tone, and I realize the need to avoid a simple rehash of the Raimi films. (Nobody would want that; we can rightfully expect more from the excellent MCU.) I actually prefer the Raimi films, though. While Tom Holland might be the better Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire was a strange casting choice), the Raimi movies were more ¬Ö heartfelt. They were an earnest exploration of the Spider-Man of the comics, and they felt ¬Ö truer. ""Homecoming,"" in contrast, is yet another cool installment in the ""Avengers"" series. ""Spider Man 2"" came out 13 years ago, and I can still remember how that movie made me feel ‚Äî not to mention how its sheer quality vindicated ""comic book movies"" like no other film before it. This new movie will not be memorable that way.<br/><br/>Anyway, although my criticisms above are obviously lengthy, please know that this is only because I love the source material so much ‚Äî and we comic book fans have a tendency to analyze. I certainly enjoyed the movie, and I'd cheerfully recommend it. (Note my rating.) The MCU continues to entertain with quality movies; its consistency, even with its expanding group of ongoing Netflix series, is kind of astonishing.<br/><br/>Go see this. You'll have fun."
"drummond-03515","10","35","65","9 July 2017"," Great re-boot, however traditionalist spider-fans may be upset with all the changes!
","As a long time spidey fan and huge admirer of the MCU films I went into this with massive expectations. <br/><br/>I wasn't disappointed. <br/><br/>Like many others I did find myself questioning the need to change the race of some of the supporting characters purely to show diversity in Hollywood, but after lengthy internal arguments I have concluded that the film actually benefits from breaking the mould and setting the scene in an all new friendly neighborhood.<br/><br/>Tom Holland is an incredible Peter Parker/spider-man, he nails every scene be it down to his comedic timing, gymnastic athleticism or touching moments opposite Aunt May or best friend Ned Leeds, who is arguably the greatest sidekick ever! <br/><br/>Tony Stark's father figure, Happy Hogan's 'big brother', Flash Thompson's jealous rival, 'love interest' Liz & Michelle's 'quirky friend' all add to the mix and provide chemistry to help develop Peters character to a level never experienced in a spider-movie before and it is a refreshing change from the uncle Ben/Norman Osborn stuff we have seen before.<br/><br/>The rest supporting cast is also great, with a shout out for Micheal Keatons -Vulture/Adrian Toomes who brings the exact mix of desperation and fear to the role and adds another terrific villain to Marvels cinematic rouges gallery. <br/><br/>As the story unfolds and we learn of Liz's parentage, the tone of the film shifts from 'high school coming of age comedy' to 'full on action heroics'...the scene where Spidey is trapped under the warehouse roof and he has to find within himself the will to keep pushing is something I have wanted to see since a similar story from the comics in the 60's, its a real 'spidey-moment' where he realises that even without Stark's new suit and gadgets - he is Spider-Man! From then on the final battle against the Vulture on/above/around an invisible Stark jet is simply sensational.<br/><br/>To compare this film to the Andrew Garfield or Tobey Maguire movies is unfair, and to compare to the original stories from the comics is impossible, people should remember that when Stan Lee created these characters the world was a completely different place than it is today!<br/><br/>This version stands its ground and isn't afraid to mix things up in order to remain fresh but keeps enough of the classic stuff to feel familiar. <br/><br/>Personally I loved this film and cant wait for the 'inevitable' sequels."
"Terryfan","9","35","65","7 July 2017"," Spider-Man has come home
","Spider-Man Homecoming puts our friendly neighborhood super hero back where he belongs. I'm going to keep this review free of spoilers. <br/><br/>After the successful run of the first Spider-Man Trilogy 2002-2007 and the ridiculous 2012 Reboot series we got a film that this time makes you feel like you really are in Spider-Man's world.<br/><br/>We also get to see what happens to him following his role in ""Civil War"". What makes the movie good is that it is not a reboot more like showing how Peter Parker has been Spider-Man for a while now and shows how his life has been since then as he still struggles with problems as a Super Hero and life in school and so one. It actually feels like a test of character for Spider-Man/Peter Parker in this movie. But he also must deal with a new comer in town The Vulture.<br/><br/>The action scenes in the movie are pretty tense and action pack that will make you go Wow. It was like they timed each scene to prepare you for the fight to come<br/><br/>The story just holds your interest from the moment the film starts. The comedy in this movie really out did itself while some jokes were kind of out of place the rest of the jokes will leave you laughing for which Spider-Man has been known to have a sense of humor so smart thinking for the comedy.<br/><br/>The music is good as well and helps drove the story.<br/><br/>The best performances for the movie goes to Tom Holland as Spider-Man/Peter Parker who after his performance in ""Civil War"" restore the hope that we will have a better Spider-Man movie and he did a very good job, Micheal Keaton as Adrian Toomes/Vulture really was great as the main antagonist each time he was on screen it was bound to be trouble Michael's performance shines in this movie. I have to rank him as one of Marvel Climactic Universe best villains. Robert Downey Jr reprise his role as Tony Stark/Iron Man and his performance works for the movie. Marisa Tomei as Aunt May Marisa is a rare actress where anything she touches is gold and she was good for her role in the movie. <br/><br/>The movie does have some problems mostly some characters feel out of place and should have not been in this movie one character was better not to have at all in the film also the end credit scene had everyone in the theater more or less in Awe and disgust. It was just a bad move on the film maker's part to have a wasted end credit scene but it is what it is. And again some jokes felt flat.<br/><br/>But those flaws are not going to ruin your joy of watching this movie that helps proves Marvel has does it again and that Marvel prove they can restore one of their biggest characters to his original glory. <br/><br/>I give Spider-Man Homecoming an 9 out of 10"
"manoj_kumar-69531","9","35","65","6 July 2017"," This is How an Introductory movie should be done.
","Well!! Well!! Well!! This movie made me laugh right from the first shot of the movie! Thankfully they chose a guy who can act instead of being the pretty boy for a change!! Tom Holland was an excellent choice for the role and he did justice to it 100%. Starts of with a Vlog/I- movie made by the geeky Peter Parker who gets psyched out for being recruited to be a part of Avengers!!. This entire thing was hilarious.Here they give us a hint of why the bad guy actually became the bad guy!!! You almost feel bad for him coz well the government takes away his livelihood. Michael Keaton now we know how he became the BIRD MAN.<br/><br/>The movie cuts to a couple of months later after the big showdown in Berlin in CA:CIVIL WAR.Peter Parker desperately trying to be involved with the Avengers again.He goes around being himself ""The friendly neighborhood spiderman"".. He feels he is meant for better things than being stuck in the Robotics Lab or the School Band. He keeps saving people and he tries to impress the girl he likes but he just can't coz he can't reveal who he is. I liked how they focused on his shortcomings instead of glorifying who he is. They showed that he was just a normal kid in tight spandex(or so we thought). As in every superhero movie he gets his Nerdy ,good with computers friend after he accidentally reveals himself to him. <br/><br/>They both accidentally find out that there are features hidden in his spidey suit Mr.Tony Stark kept in check to see whether he was worth it or not. He doesn't know how to use them and i liked the female version of Jarvis in his suit. He became a combination of SPIDERMAN and IRON MAN- a SPIRONMAN if you will(couldn't resist it )<br/><br/>Needless to say he kicks the bad guys ass and saves the Damsel In Distress ,becomes a superhero and well loved but can't take credit coz he cant reveal who he is. Bad guy keeps getting more powerful and richer with all his Alien and human weapons amalgamations. As always he is greedy and tries to over do it and spidey keeps getting in his way. Spidey screws things up big time once and TS takes his suit away and he says he is nothing without the suit. They depict the inner conflict and the feeling of helplessness very well throughout.<br/><br/>In a final heist THE METAL BIRDMAN and Spidey go head to head with the help of his friend the Fat Cisco(character from TV show FLASH) track him down but due to his lack of experience or thats how it portrayed spidey ends up under a huge pile of rubble and he fights his inner demons to become who he is and goes ahead and saves the day with a well shot mid air f(l)ight with birdman. Shout out to Michael Keaton who i think was an excellent choice for this role. <br/><br/>Finally as in every Superhero movie the hero saves the day without actually loosing sight of value of life or property destruction(lesser than other Marvel ones at least). I liked how they made the movie about Spiderman and not revolved around a girl or some other character.<br/><br/>Tony Stark impressed with Spideys antics offers him a new suit which looks awesome but Spiderman as he says wants to feel grounded and rejects to being part of it all and returns to being the friendly neighborhood spiderman. As classy as TS is he does return his suit to him at the last shot of the movie.<br/><br/>PS:The only negative they have to stop making his date/Girlfriends dad as the bad guy. I think its been overdone.<br/><br/>Go watch this movie."

","This is the worst spiderman movie ever made. This time there is a stupid technological spiderman suit, a lot of computer graphic effects but they forgot the most important thing... the spiderman as a real hero.. the story is extremely poor and will make you think ""what I am doing here ?"" in the middle of the movie and tease you to leave the theater.<br/><br/>this movie is more a comic movie than a super hero movie and it was design essentially for 12 years old kids.. and btw, my 12 years old boy hated this movie."

","I've seen five of the six Spider-Man movies featuring Spider-Man as the title character in the movie theater. 'The Amazing Spider-Man' was the one I missed. I'd really have to say this is a top 2 or 3 Spider-Man movie. It's one of the best. Tom Holland is very solid as our web shooting hero. It's more of a plot about his adventures as opposed to an origin story. Tony Stark/Iron Man is in the movie the right amount, not too much nor too little. <br/><br/>The movie has a good balance of fun, action and suspense. Michael Keaton is a solid, but not an all-time great movie super-villain. He's similar to Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin in many ways. He's intense and a worthy superhero adversary. You can also feel small elements of the original Spider-Man trilogy or the Amazing Spider-Man series within at times. <br/><br/>One aspect I liked about this version of the character, is how he's modified to the modern era of Marvel movies. He's high tech and now involved in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Again, I felt Tom Holland did a great job and his high school pal was a riot as well!"
"sriharsha-78789","9","34","63","7 July 2017"," Summer feast
","Thanks to the director for not starting it again with how peter became spider-man. The whole story was so fresh. The humor was too good. Best movie for the summer. The ending was too good. And don't forget about the end credits, stick on to your seats. It's really good how they managed Iron man's screen space. Anything more than this would make us feel as an Iron man movie with spider man in it. Tom Holland is too good as Spider-man. To me this was the best movie of all the spider-man series, of course let's not count the first one(Spider man 2002) cause that's the one which showed us the story of Peter Parker/Spider-man on big screens."
"beezaah","9","34","63","7 July 2017"," An awesome movie experience!
","Spider-Man: Homecoming is refreshing, exciting, funny and captivating. Tom Holland 'nails it', artfully combining the dichotomous attributes of human and superhuman, of fearful and fearless, into the most realistic and audacious Spider-Man character ever. Michael Keaton is the King of Villains!<br/><br/>The director and cast made a real connection with the audience tonight. At the conclusion of the opening show, more than five minutes after the credits ended, I was stunned by the deafening roar of the fans, still in their seats, discussing their favorite scenes as theater crews scrambled to clean for the next sellout crowd."
"michaelmcdonald-20730","7","57","112","6 July 2017"," A movie for teens that's fun for adults if you don't think about it too much (Minor spoilers)
","Marvel's first movie exclusively for teens still has its fun moments for adults, though it can sour upon further reflection. <br/><br/>Let's start with the good stuff. Tom Holland is probably the best Spider-Man yet. His best friend provides great comic relief and the two have terrific chemistry. Marisa Tomei adds a breathe of fresh air to the role of Aunt May. Michael Keaton provides Marvel with its first memorable villain in a while. The action scenes flow smoothly, and the humor mostly works (again, this is a teen movie). <br/><br/>Those are the things that stand out after immediately leaving the theater, and for that reason it gets high marks in my book. <br/><br/>But the adult in me started thinking about what I just watched, and there's some stuff that bugs me. The following contains minor spoilers. <br/><br/>""With great power comes great responsibility"" is the famous line from the first Spider-Man, which neatly summarizes the core theme of the film, and Peter Parker's internal conflict with being Spider-Man. <br/><br/>This film also has a one-liner like that, spoken to Peter by Tony Stark: ""If you're nothing without this suit, you don't deserve to wear it."" And it's actually quite illustrative of what's wrong with this film. <br/><br/>The fist Spider-Man movie in 2002 emphasized taking responsibility for your actions. The amount of responsibility this Spider-Man takes for his actions is, well, none. A list of the damage this ""friendly neighborhood"" Spider-Man directly/indirectly inflicts includes: - Swinging through a neighborhood destroying roofs, fences, tree houses, etc. - Blowing up a bodega - Setting a bomb off in the Washington Monument nearly killing all his friends - Blowing up a boat, nearly drowning everyone on board - Nearly crashing a plane into a city <br/><br/>Now it's not like Spider-Man is trying to stop some ticking time bomb or rescue a loved one from imminent death, and all these destructive acts are the consequence. No, he's simply chasing down thieves, led by The Vulture.<br/><br/>However, his recklessness eventually forces Tony Stark to take back the advanced suit, delivering the impactful line. And yet, Peter Parker dons his homemade Spider-Man costume a couple scenes later when he learns the Vulture has another heist planned, which results in the aforementioned plane scene. <br/><br/>But Tony isn't mad about that one, cause Spider-Man got the bad guy this time. Ends justify the means I guess. I don't want to extrapolate without ruining the whole movie, but suffice to say, it's inexplicable that Tony is okay with Peter's actions, especially considering the events of the Civil War movie.<br/><br/>Thus thematically, there really is no arch. Peter doesn't learn about taking responsibility for his actions - he simply accomplishes a task without wearing the high tech suit Tony gave him. Peter's only real lesson in the movie is that he'd rather be a regular kid than an Avenger. <br/><br/>And then there's the nitpicking. <br/><br/>Let's start with Flash Gordon, the classic ""cool jock"" who's a major asshole and bullies Peter throughout high school. <br/><br/>Well now he's not a jock at all. He's a ""nerd"" (in fact, literally every high school character in this film falls into the modern day millennial ""nerd"" category) who is still a major asshole and bullies Peter. He calls him ""Penis Parker"" and, well, that's about it. His character's sole purpose seems to be to remind the audience ""hey, bullies can be smart academically- minded kids too!"" Um, okay. Someone let me know if you know a kid on the Science Debate Team who leads chants of ""Penis"" as he DJs a house party to mock a classmate. I'm genuinely curious. <br/><br/>Then there's the girl Peter likes, who mostly ignores him but is on the same trivia team as Peter (Flash is also on this team, as is every other student you meet). Peter ditches her all the time, but for some reason he musters the courage to ask her out, and inexplicably she says yes. <br/><br/>There's another girl named Michelle who's the resident loner (again, on the trivia team) who refuses to tour the Washington Monument in order to remind the audience that slaves built it. However, this completely contradicts with the ""Make America Great Again!"" sticker on her backpack. <br/><br/>That's a joke. <br/><br/>So to summarize: it's a movie for kids, don't think about it too much and you'll enjoy it too."
"jon.h.ochiai","9","33","61","9 July 2017"," The Hero is Way More Than Just the Suit
","After fearlessly saving Liz, played by smart pretty Laura Harrier, from the plunging elevator in Washington Monument as Spider-Man, 15 year- old Peter, played by Tom Holland, summons all his courage to tell Liz, ""I like you."" Peter then asks the girl of his dreams to the Homecoming dance, ""Do you want to go with me?"" This is the distinct delightful charm of ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"". Director and Writer Jon Watts's ""Spider-Man"" is visually stunning action as when Peter strains together the severed ferry boat in the Hudson. ""Homecoming"" is clumsy and clunky at times, but it is all heart.<br/><br/>Watts and the army of screenwriters, Jonathan Goldstein, John Francis Daley, Christopher Ford, Chris McKenna, and Erik Sommers composed the narrative based on the Marvel Comic with varying outcomes. Tom Holland is the star who enrolls our compassion. As Spider-Man and his teenage persona Peter, Holland has a frenetic and gee whiz charm√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùhe captures the kid whom Peter Parker really is. Peter's friendship with geek buddy Ned, played by spirited Jacob Batalon, has a sweet and timeless air of youth and innocence. <br/><br/>Fortunately, the story leverages the gravitas of Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark and Iron Man in the new role of Peter's mentor and father figure. Holland's quiet power emerges from this screen partnership and expands throughout. After Tony confronts Peter's recklessness, Peter tells him, ""I wanted to be like you."" Tony says, ""I wanted you to be better than me!"" At its best ""Homecoming"" is about seeing and allowing for the greatness in others. <br/><br/>At times however, ""Spider-Man"" stumbles over itself. Michael Keaton as the villain Vulture and Adrian Toomes is not compelling. Keaton's performance is magnetic. All Toomes is, is angry and bitter. No nuance of the character. He is about money and greed. So what? ""Homecoming"" opens 8 years ago as Tony Stark and the Government void Toomes's lucrative construction contract to repair the demolished Avengers Headquarters following the vicious alien invasion. In the following years Toomes utilizes the stolen alien technology from the Avengers site to steal and market weapons of mass destruction. With this technology Toomes creates himself as the advanced weapon, the Vulture. We empathize with great villains in their exposed humanity. Unfortunately, as good as Keaton is, Toomes is a heartless jerk. <br/><br/>In a departure from previous ""Spider-Man"" movies Peter's guardian Aunt May is played by stunningly beautiful and funny Marisa Tomei. Previous incarnations of Aunt May were as a much older sage woman. Not someone who gets hit on by the server at their favorite Thai restaurant. In a touching scene Peter implores Ned not to tell Aunt May that he is Spider-Man, because ""she has suffered enough"". Watts clearly missed the opportunity to deepen the relationship with May, who believes and loves Peter. She is kind and soulful as she coaches Peter for his Homecoming date. Too bad much of Tomei's performance is the irony of her youthful attraction. <br/><br/>In the story Peter returns from battle in ""Captain America: Civil War"" with Tony Stark (Downey Jr.). Tony gifts Peter with the Stark Industries high-tech Spider-Man suit. Peter believes that if he proves himself, he can become an Avenger. In the meantime, he'll be the hero as ""the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man"". Tony's assistant Happy, played by hilarious Jon Favreau, takes charge of Peter's personal growth. When not doing the ""Stark Fellowship"" duties, Peter resumes high school life as member of the Academic Team and sparring with iconoclast Michelle, played by wonderful Zendaya, who perhaps is a little too annoyed with Peter. <br/><br/>Holland's exuberance and understated power make him perhaps the best Spider-Man in a long while. His mercurial presence lightens up the screen on ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"". He captures the frailty, grace and courage of the hero. His Peter discovers that the hero within is way more than just the suit he wears. He finds his power as he believes in himself. That inspires in ""Spider-Man: Homecoming""."

","I'm a little disappointed in this film. I'm not happy the direction the Avengers franchise decided to take - outside its norm of blockbuster films, by changing the screenplay to be geared towards tweens. That's younger than a teenager. We all know they can be more annoying than teenagers sometimes, and this was the case with Tom Holland playing Peter/Spidey. He was just plain and annoying. I'm not sure if it was casting him for the role, are just a bad screenplay. All I have embedded in my brain is his annoying whiny yelling when the action started, every single time. I though to myself, ""what a lousy superhero this kid would make.. no, wait.. he IS the superhero."" I just couldn't get past it. But I guess it's an untapped marked of new moviegoers that can go see it with their mom and dads and enjoy it. So in the franchises defense, it was a marketing move. But for me, I've lost respect for Spidey. I hope the next installment that includes Spiderman at least casts someone more convincing as a superhero, not some little wimpy whiny kid.

","The Spider-man: Homecoming film is one of the greatest movies of 2017 so far. The movie shows Peter Parker as a teenager and his struggle to get into the Avengers and battling high-school at the same time. <br/><br/>The casting of Tom Holland as Spider-man is just incredible! He was able to perfectly portray the Peter Parker and Spider-man we all know and love from the comics. The Peter Parker in this movie really helped the audience connect with him as if he was just another kid from New York. Adding Robert Downey Jr. a.k.a. Iron Man in this movie as a father figure to Peter, was also a brilliant idea. The Spider-man in this movie is still this friendly neighborhood Spider-man from the comics without being too cocky and too awkward. <br/><br/>A lot of fans are complaining about the big changes from the comics too like how Flash is a nerd and not a jock which we can all understand but personally, I'm okay with changes. This movie isn't for people who are afraid of changes and really want to stick with the story in the comics.<br/><br/>Overall, I think this movie is just great! The acting, the visuals, etc. Although the acting scenes fell a little short, it wasn't really the main point about this movie anyway. It's about Peter Parker discovering more about himself and trying to be much more independent. This movie really helps the audience connect with Peter Parker/ Spider-man. I can't wait for the future Spider-man movies in the MCU. 9/10."

","Tom Holland as Spiderman was the best idea ever. This movie was web slinging fun the whole time. Tom Holland deserves an Academy Award for his great job as Spiderman / Peter Parker.

"tymbus","8","54","106","3 July 2017"," Spiderman, Spiderman, does whatever an Avenger can
","One of the aims of the new Spiderman movie is to work the character into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Guest appearances by Tony Stark and his shell-headed alter ego, Iron Man, ease the process and succeed in a way a similar attempt with Doctor Strange didn't. <br/><br/>However, there is a price. Marvel comics used to respect the different qualities of their characters and for decades Spider-man was seen as too much of an outsider to join a team. That said, the gee-whiz gadgets are a fleeting addition to Spidey's costume and he does eventually turn down an offer to join The Avengers.<br/><br/>I wasn't really taken with the felt like quality of the red material on Spider-Man's costume, or the indistinct design elements. Oscar winning costume designer James Acheson got it more right in Spider- Man I to III. And I liked Rami's idea that Parker produced his own webbing as part of his mutation. However, no movie has resolved the problem that when fully masked, the audience is left staring at an emotion free bucket over the hero's head.<br/><br/>The risk with integrating everything into the MCU is everything becomes an iteration of an Iron Man movie. Spider-man has a large, unique cast of his own. Here we get the Shocker, The Vulture and even The Tinkerer (!). Homecoming is an assertively multi-ethnic take on The Spider-Man cast. It works well although fans of the comic book like me may find the new Flash Thompson - a bullying geek rather than a sports jock - takes time getting used to.<br/><br/>Tom Holland is a great take on Spider-Man, funny, endearing, sincere. Although this isn't an origin story, the film traces his personal development as a super hero, pratfalls and all. Michael Keaton is perfectly cast, although I wonder at the way Hollywood casting works ""Hey he was a Birdman so why not a vulture!"" . In the end Keaton provides the film with gravitas, nuance and intensity. By the movie's end, I just wanted him back as Batman (come on, honestly, have any of his successors really been better?)<br/><br/>I wasn't keen on the battle armored look of the Vulture, it reminded me too much of the Rhino in Amazing Spiderman2, but the character really was a comic book creation and couldn't survive a literal translation to the big screen without appearing ridiculous. Homecoming works The Vulture into the Marvel Cinematic Universe via The first Avengers movie. Toomes (AKA The Vulture) is keen to salvage and use alien technology left on Earth by invading aliens.<br/><br/>My only quibbles are 1) the final fight between The Vulture and Spider-Man is barely readable thanks to the editing presumably covering up animation difficulties. 2) Since the movie is called Homecoming it would have been good to stage a climax during and at the actual homecoming party.<br/><br/>I enjoyed Rami's take on The Spider-man story, recasting it in a cinematic language borrowed from horror movies. Even in the messed up Spider-man 3 this allowed the alien Venom a credible entry into the Spiderverse and delivered a great take on The SandMan as a Ray Harryhausen monster. In the comic, Spider-Man combined the schlock 50's horror with gangster villains who echoed Dick Tracy's rogues gallery. Homecoming redresses the balance away from sci-fi monsters towards gangsterism. <br/><br/>I don't grasp what went wrong with Andrew Garfield's version of the character but Brit Tom Holland really nails the teen hero. Next: The Scorpion. I can't wait.Actually, I can."

"littleging12","4","11","17","21 August 2017"," Just Another Marvel Movie. Nothing New Here.
","The MCU tried to aggrandize its cast of superheroes by integrating Spider-Man into the mix in Captain America: Civil War. After an already attempted reboot, the odds were against this pseudo-origin story from being a success although the lovable childish charms of Tom Holland's take on the character was its one silver lining. The end result is a sporadically entertaining special effects driven comedy-drama that lacks in consistent humor, engaging action and serious drama.<br/><br/>Spider-Man: Homecoming diverted away from the other Spidey entries by focusing more time on Peter Parker rather than Spider-man. The film is heavily inspired by 80's high school comedy-dramas. It's more lighthearted and comical, which ultimately works against the movie because it's hard taking any of the perilous situations seriously. The action scenes are unimpressive and more been-there-done-that. Some of the jokes land while others are just lame, annoying, and/or repetitive (i.e. Penis Parker, ice cream in the car). There were some good performances (Michael Keaton as Vulture) and an interesting little twist, yet they didn't pack the punch needed to redeem the film.<br/><br/>Spider-Man: Homecoming is just another byproduct of an already successful formula. No risks were taken, no characters died, and no lasting impression was left. The MCU continues to play it safe and only when they decide to break from their puss-cocoon will they finally produce something truly great. 5.5/10"
"Incinerary","4","11","17","9 July 2017"," Worst MCU movie I've seen. Should have been titled Spiderman: The Nuisance
","***THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS***<br/><br/>Spiderman has always been the superhero with potential, but it could never really be pulled off. I had a lot of anticipation for this particular Spiderman movie since I have never been disappointed with an MCU movie before and also because I really enjoyed this character in Civil War. But this movie was poorly written, the action was underwhelming, surround sound was sub-par, and overall seemed to target the younger audience. Like most of the other Avengers, they have had their development movie, except the difference between the other Avengers and Spiderman are they were actually skillful and successful warriors. Spiderman is a complete failure who can't run straight and failed to successfully accomplish anything himself, all while acting like a typical teenager during that ""Invincible I can do anything"" stage. Why would anyone want to see a movie like that? That's why I only give this movie 4 stars.<br/><br/>Back in Civil War, Spiderman himself seemed very cool, funny, and also came across as a skillful fighter as he put up a darn good fight against actual Avengers. However, I think he was really only there to be a Nuisance just as he was throughout Homecoming. In this movie, Spiderman was the loser know as ""Penis Parker,"" he wasn't funny, and his mobility and fighting skills were terrible! Everywhere he went he did nothing but cause millions of dollars in damage because he didn't know what he was doing and couldn't contain the situation making everything go from bad to worse.<br/><br/>***MAJOR SPOILERS BEGIN HERE*** 1) At the bank, Spiderman fails to apprehend a couple thugs who ended up getting away and destroying the bank and a restaurant. 2) When Spiderman was chasing the van, he could not run or swing for the life of him all while destroying everything he touched; fences, sheds, roofs, lights, all carelessly wrecked as he chased this van. In the end, the van got away and he almost drowned until Iron Man comes and saves him. 3) At the Cargo Ship scene, Spiderman fails again to defeat the bad guys and because of his careless actions, he ruined the FBI's undercover mission, the entire cargo ship gets cut directly in half, the bad guys get away again, and you guessed it, Iron Man comes again to save the day by welding the ship back together. 4) During the final scenes between Spiderman and the Vulture, Stark Tower was loading a cargo plane with super dangerous and powerful exotic materials, and of course, it's an autonomous plane with no personnel, security, or cameras on board making it super easy to hijack. That should never have happened to a Stark plane. Spiderman tries to save the day again but can't fully contain the situation and the plane crashes. 5) After the crash, the Vulture has Spiderman in his hand and is about to kill him, but wait! Look at that shiny thing over there! He finds some of the remaining exotic materials, drops Spiderman, and then the Vulture randomly blows up because why not and in the end again, Spiderman never really saved the day. 6) After all of that failing time after time again and causing at least a billion dollars in damages, Iron Man invites him to become an Avenger?! What?!?!<br/><br/><ul><li>I also did not like the cheesy love story part of this movie. Peter constantly ditched Michelle at every occasion; the party, the pool, their national tournament, and the homecoming dance, yet she still had feelings for him for no real reason. She's the type of chick that'll grow up to marry an alcoholic husband who physically and verbally abuses her on a daily basis, but she'll still be all like ""But I still love him!"" In the end, the Vulture, who turns out to be her dad, is caught and Michelle moves to Oklahoma because why not and that's the end of her.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Two positive things I can say are the visuals of the movie were amazing as always, and there were a couple funny moments, but most of them were not from Spiderman. I really hope this Spiderman doesn't become a frequently returning character. The Vulture wasn't even that dangerous of a villain, he was just part of a small group of people who stole stuff and sold weapons to a couple random thugs on the street. That's nothing that could threaten an entire city and Spiderman couldn't even handle him. Spiderman simply cannot compare to the rest of the Avengers and he doesn't deserve a sequel unless he is portrayed as an actual skillful lifesaving hero.</li></ul>"
"generationofswine","9","36","68","7 July 2017"," An Honest Review
","I won't complain about the continuity error within the MCU...because no one really cares least of all myself.<br/><br/>Well, how do we do this. I mean, it is refreshing that Garfield is gone and with him the Spider-Bully. For Marvel comics fans, it really hurt watching Garfield bully and taunt his victims.<br/><br/>Now we have a Spidey that is, well, nice. Holland is able to be funny and wise-cracking without seeming like a, well, a Flash Thompson. With that it beings us back to the source material.<br/><br/>In other words Holland puts the ""friendly"" back in ""your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man."" And I think the MCU was well aware of this, given the time they took to make sure everyone knew Holland was going to be the hero that everyone loves.<br/><br/>And then Keaton does a great vulture from his origin to his demise he seemed to do everything he could to really become the character.<br/><br/>My only complaints were the supporting cast. Aunt May I can accept with a moderate grudge because she is a great actress...<br/><br/>But Tony Revolori doesn't seem....built enough to be Flash. He's more the bully of the Millennial generation that uses words and little more and...when it comes down to it, even those are vapid.<br/><br/>What's that old adage, ""sticks and stones will break my bones but words will never harm me."" Millennials I guess have never heard that.<br/><br/>Flash is supposed to be that big bully jock that hits his prime in high school and, a decade later, delivers the pizza when you go home to visit your folks...this Flash has a future.<br/><br/>And the MJ tease at the end...it went a little too far away from the character in looks and personality to sit well.<br/><br/>Still, on the whole the movie is a breath of fresh air in its distance from Garfield's rendition and at times, Holland was even able to pull off almost a James Bond quality while still portraying a kid over his head.<br/><br/>Like all MCU movies, however, the pay off is the humor."
"ericstevenson","9","25","45","10 July 2017"," Odd title
","I'm not going to say that this has the best Spider-Man because that honor still belongs to Tobey Maguire. My only complaint with this film is that it didn't show Spider-Man's origin. I thought they were at least going to show flashbacks of how it happened. Still, Spider-Man can have many different stories in all these iterations. This movie boasts of awesome action scenes, many heartfelt moments and tons of funny jokes. It's basically everything a good film should have. It's great to have Tony Stark contribute to the story. Captain America appears too, but not in a way you'd expect.<br/><br/>It's amazing we've had this many iterations in 15 years. The villain, the Vulture is never referred to by name. It was weird seeing Michael Keaton as a supervillain when he played a superhero in ""Batman"". I thought maybe the scene in the middle with Spider-Man bringing the boat together was a reference to the scene where he stops the bus in ""Spider-Man 2"". While I still find that the best Spider-Man movie, this is a close second. The funniest part was when he had that deep voice in interrogation mode. Maybe not that much heart, but still tons of fun and everything you'd want in a Spider-Man movie. ***1/2"
"Screen_Blitz","8","25","45","7 July 2017"," Fun, charming comic-book adventure that proudly handles justice for the titular hero
","Our friendly neighborhood Spiderman has made his return to the big screen, and he is more charming than ever. With the filmmaking rights now handed to Marvel Studios from Columbia Pictures, the titular hero is gained membership to the Marvel Cinematic Universe with a more unique approach unlike what he saw in the Sam Raimi trilogy or the underwhelming reboot series starring Andrew Garfield. With the days of Garfield as the web-slinging hero now three years in the rear-view mirror, this comic-book adventure helms Tom Holland in the role of the title character, after advertising a spectacular introduction in last year's 'Captain America: Civil War'. And the director responsible of this project is Jon Watts who grants the hero with a more zany approach than what we were accustomed to in the past, in attempt to connect him to the MCU's Avengers team. This also allows for brief appearances by MCU veterans such as Iron Man and even briefer ones by Chris Evans's Captain America. Following the events of Civil War, this film follows 15-year old Peter Parker (played by Tom Holland), a geeky high schooler struggling to balance his social life at school with his best friend Ned (played by Jacob Batalon), and his time crime-fighting as the titular web-slinging superhero which he hides of Aunt May (played by Marisa Tomei). Under the watchful, if overprotective eye of Tony Stark/Iron Man (played by Robert Downey Jr.), Peter must prove he is worthy of becoming the hero Tony wants him to be, as well as making a good impression of his crush Liz (played by Laura Harrier), when he faces down the evil Vulture (played by Michael Keaton) who is in possession of some dangerous weapons. <br/><br/>Aside from shedding away from the slightly darker tone of the previous Spiderman entries, Jon Watts also grants the title character with a more polished story rather than rehashing familiar elements from the past. Instead of embarking on yet another origin story, this film jumps almost immediately into the action while setting up the relationship between Peter Parker and Tony Stark, with some sadly predictable results thanks to the trailer giving away certain plot points. This method allows for more potent character development. The story establishes Peter as a typical teenager with common high school problems including the struggles of impressing the girl of his dreams and getting caught in the crossfires of bully Flash Thompson (played by Tony Revolori) who often makes crude remarks of him. At the same time, it also touches on Peter's ambition to impress Tony and Happy Hogan (played by Jon Favreau, the supporting man of Stark Industries, when Michael Keaton's Vulture and his evil deeds catches his eye. This all leads to some exhilarating, frenetic action sequences polished some dazzling special effects. The rescue sequence on the United States monument is spectacularly executed, as is the scene of Spiderman trying hundreds of people on a ferry that gets fractured in half. The climatic scene on the airplane however, is a bit of an eyesore. Setting the scene at night with components of the plane exploding and sparks flying everywhere renders the fight between Spiderman and Vulture a bit too incoherent for the eyes to follow. Nonetheless, the final result somewhat pays off. As for Tom Holland, now the youngest actor portray the title character, he makes pleasant use of his role with a great sense of charm and humor that evokes a decent amount of laughs from time to time, even when some of the jokes fall flat. Michael Keaton also boasts a nice delivery as the main antagonist. Then there is Robert Downey Jr. who pops in and out as Tony Stark and Iron Man, only given around eight minutes of screen time.<br/><br/>Spiderman: Homecoming is a fun, charming comic-book adventure that proudly handles the justice for the titular superhero, and rightfully does so without feeling the need to set up for the upcoming 'Avengers: Infinity War'. It is a fun superhero spectacle destined to please fans of both the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the comics. If there is anything more accurate to bet on, it will be the astounding box office performance which will more than likely be in competition against last month's 'Wonder Woman'."

The only thing that keeps this film from being one of the best of all time is the inclusion of Hannibal Buress. He is getting a lot of mileage from throwing Bill Cosby under the bus.

But since his enemy doesn't know that Peter is Spider-man the awkward tension was absolutely perfect. Allot of people could have thought that he was going to be held hostage but that was not the case, which made this sequence outstanding.

Dark scenes and night effects were disaster. Avengers is far superior film if it comes to CGI and visual effects.

I'm not a teen. This movies had plenty of obvious scientific mistakes which are (at least should be) easily recognized by an adult. But I don't think they should stop you from enjoying this fun movie.<br/><br/>Probably the BEST movie I have EVER seen for a 13-17 year old kid. If I was 15, I'd fall in love with the movie for sure. It's fun, it's enjoyable to watch, it has great humor, it tries to show Spiderman (or Spiderteen?) dealing with the (very) insignificant teen problems that teens still find significant, and it introduces Spiderman to the MCU as smoothly as possible (was hard to imagine how he would fit in such a world). The main characters are simply amazing. It tries to make a 15-year old imagine ""What if I was to become spiderman?"", and delivers this BRILLIANTLY. Movies have a target audience, and when you walk into this movie you should expect to watch a movie with teen target audience. Don't expect to be mind-browned. Don't expect a complicated scenario. Expect a fun, simple journey of an almost 15-year old geek teen getting super-powers.<br/><br/>If I wasn't told this before the movie, maybe I'd be a bit disappointed, and give it a rating of 7/10."

We never do learn what that mission was but Peter Parker wants to become a member of the Avengers. In the meantime he must attend High School and as Spiderman he cruises his neighborhood to handle petty crimes or to help people. Spiderman breaks up an ATM theft, and discovers the weapons used are alien in function. He tries to warn Happy, but is not successful <br/><br/>This must be some kind of reboot of Spiderman. Many things are different. Peter's Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) is a young hottie, without husband. Ned (Jacob Batalon) his HS chum discovers that Peter is Spiderman. Peter has a love interest in Liz (Laura Harrier) and we find out later that her father is bad guy Adrian/Vulture (Michael Keaton), who was a salvage contractor who is shut down by Local government official Ann Marie Hoag (Tyne Daly). The Avengers battled and beat aliens called the Chitauri and much of alien equipment is salvageable. Adrian decides to keep much of the alien equipment and makes weapons out of them and later turns himself into Vulture. <br/><br/>We will see that Tony Stark doesn't have all the confidence in 15- year old Peter Parker and takes back the special suit he gave Peter. Peter feels he is nothing without the suit and this disappoints Tony Stark. Somewhat shaken Peter Parker goes it alone to take down Adrian and his organization and learns that it isn't the suit that helps him.<br/><br/>Notables : Stan Lee as an apartment tenant who shout s out a window; Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts and we see her very briefly near the end of the movie; Chris Evan as Captain America, but we just see him in a TV motivational presentation for high school students. <br/><br/>This is actually very good, a little too long, perhaps, but very good nevertheless. The CGI is fantastic and the music helps things along too. <br/><br/>Stay after the credits run to heart stomping music to see an additional scene with Adrian in prison. Why they put it after the credits is beyond me. <br/><br/>With this new reboot we should see more of a more mature (he did turn down Tony Stark's invitation to stay at Tony's new place with the Avengers) Spiderman and maybe with the Avengers too.

One thing that slightly annoyed me was that there is no mention, reference or flashback to his backstory (the spider bite); regardless, it would have been good to see some of the abilities develop, like the 'spider-sense', which was completely missing from the movie! The twist near the end was decent, but overall the movie meant nothing in the grand scheme of the MCU and there was no interesting link to the next chapter in the series.

I guess one could call this ""refreshing"" as it certainly brings the would-be super hero crashing down to earth multiple times but to the extent that it is irritating and comedic - who is this fool? The original tale with Tobey Macguire is vastly superior IMO and captures Spider-Man's earthy, fallible nature in a dignified way.<br/><br/>I guess it's about what sells, and target audiences.

","More than a mere reboot, Marvel Studios have begun building Spider-Man from the ground up - starting completely from scratch! This breath of fresh air casts aside the now stale formula that began well with Raimi's ""Spider-Man"" 1, before being bleakly retooled for Webb's failed ""Amazing"" franchise.<br/><br/>Marvel showcase their talents as masters of adaptation by drawing from the deep and rich source material from Stan Lee & Steve Ditko's run.<br/><br/>Although not 100% accurate on the surface, every creative decision made delivers the contemporary, authentic, spirit of a young, well-meaning teenager struggling through high school, who is constantly faced with tough choices which come to define his character.<br/><br/>The film doesn't rely on the exhausted trope of the romantic sub-plot or the love interest in peril. It doesn't need to shuffle years of comic book chronology to bring in eventual mainstays like Mary Jane or the Stacey's or the Osborn's. We have Ned Leeds, we have Liz, we have Betty and we have the Vulture and the Tinkerer (both debuted in Spidey's 2nd issue).<br/><br/>This is that relatable, young every-man that we know Spidey to be. Tom Holland perfectly portrays the character and is well supported by the comedic tone which finally gets the humour right.<br/><br/>Michael Keaton delivers an amazing performance, giving us a layered villain and the supporting cast bounce off one another in the best way - everyone shines.<br/><br/>The stakes are smaller because now we're back with the inexperienced hero finding his way, just like those early books. The friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man. Yet somehow the action is all the more threatening for it. This is because Spider-Man and his escapades are now relative to the other giants within the MCU, he really is just a kid and thus every threat is all the more dangerous.<br/><br/>I feel like the reason a few people appear to be disappointed, is because at this stage they want the high stakes, the city/ world wide threat, they want Spider-Man in his prime. Before we get there we need the set up and this is the perfect set up. Give it time. There's even more from those early years to come.<br/><br/>Also, the opening felt a little fast and perhaps one or two more emotional moments could have been drawn out slightly. Just slightly. But it's integrated into the MCU seamlessly.<br/><br/>Some of the powerful moments in the film are pulled straight from the comics, including perhaps the most iconic Spider-Man moment of all time. I won't spoil it, but my jaw hit the floor, I teared up, it was perfect.<br/><br/>This film holds some genuine surprises. It thrills. It's buckets of fun!<br/><br/>Marvel show us that not every film in its tapestry has to be the best standalone film, as long as it's the best film about that character. You'll soon see why you can't really have one Marvel property exist without the other.<br/><br/>Enjoy Spider-Man as you've never seen him before, because this really is the first time we get to meet him."

","I'm so sick of this. I'm hearing people give high praise to this dumpster fire of a movie that they completely shot out of the wrong orifice. These are the same people who gave high praise to that garbage Logan which had NOTHING to do with the Old Man Logan story. But these morons give high marks for special effects and characters they've heard of...never mind the fact that the story is TOTALLY wrong. I could list a million things wrong with this movie. <br/><br/>1. No spider sense. That by itself should be a reason to complain.<br/><br/>2. Not even HALF a mention of Uncle Ben.<br/><br/>3. Aunt May IS ACTUALLY YOUNGER THAN ME!! And you people accepted this?!<br/><br/>4. Flash is an Indian kid. Not a muscle bound jock...hell, not even SLIGHTLY athletic. Sigh!<br/><br/>5. Peter's love interest is a black chick with a white father who I don't even think is even mentioned in ANY Spider-Man comic. But hey, ""lets make everybody happy with this movie, right?"". <br/><br/>6. The Native chick at the end who called herself ""MJ"". Dude, are you serious? You know, I don't think Spiderman EVER had any minorities in its cast of characters until it got to more modern times. The same way Iron man is now a black girl. Nobody has a problem with this. The problem comes when you try to crowbar YOUR idea of what you THINK should be correct so that it's more palatable for all audiences. Nobody would have complained about an all white cast. the same way nobody will ever complain about Black Panther's cast being majority Black. you don't see anybody trying to make Storm a middle aged gay white guy, do you?<br/><br/>7. The fact that this spider man could do absolutely NOTHING right was enough for me to wanna stop watching after the 45 minute mark. I mean, seriously, 98% of what he did was totally f-up everything he tried to save and fix. That's not Spiderman....that's the guy from ""Great American Hero"" (look it up).<br/><br/>The best part of this movie was the very last end credit scene where Captain American was doing that public service announcement.

","Once again Sony tries to kick start Spider-man for the third time to try to capitalize on the superhero craze that has been buzzing through the film industry the last decade. In this entry Peter Parker is back in high school. He is a 10th grade honor student who already has super powers. So there is no origin story which is fine. We already saw this twice and that part does not need to be revisited. Spider-man in this chapter is trying to stop Vulture, Shocker, and The Tinkerer from stealing weapons from Stark Industries. This time around, Sony made a deal with Disney to be included in Civil War and have Iron Man appear in this film. <br/><br/>**Warning, some minor Spoilers ahead**<br/><br/>There are many changes the MCU made to Spider-Man lore. A lot of fans will be annoyed and angry with these changes. The first change is Spider-man himself. Spider-man does not have Spidey Senses. Instead he is indestructible and has the feel to be immortal? Throughout the film, Spider-man took some hits that would have killed him in the comics and other films. His Spidey Senses are part of his character and he seemed to have them in Captain America: Civil War. Also, for some reason Spider-man seemed to regress in his fighting abilities in this film compared to Civil War. In Civil War he seemed like a veteran who went toe to toe with Captain America and the other Avengers. This film he seemed like a novice who just got his powers. This film takes place six months after Civil War. <br/><br/>The next change is to Flash Thompson. In the comics and other films, Flash is a hulking high school bully who torments Peter. In this film, he is a skinny Italian who thinks highly of himself. Flash is on the debate club with Peter.Flash is not the hulking bully nor is he intimidating. He doesn't tower over Peter. He is just an insecure loser in this film. Mary Jane Watsonis the next change. You are wondering right now, wait, Zendaya said she was not playing Red Headed Mary Jane Watson. She is playing Michelleand at the end of the film she states her friends call her MJ as her name is Michelle Jones. Everyone knows MJ is the nickname for Mary JaneWatson. The writer of the film JohnFrancis Daley in interview admits they changed Mary Jane Watson to Michelle Jones. Aunt May is also altered to be younger and played by Marisa Tomei. In the comics AuntMay is a lot older. True fans may be a little annoyed with this. Thefinal change is Ned Leeds. In this film he becomes Peter's High school friend instead of a reporter for the Daily Bugle who later becomes one of incarnations of The Hobgoblin. <br/><br/>Spider-man: Homecoming is easily one the worst Spider-man films. That is saying a lot, especially with the misfiring of Spider-man 3. Spider-man: Homecoming is one of those films that could have done more with less. This film would have been better titled Iron Man 4: Spider-man's Homecoming. I never felt I saw Peter Parker on film. I felt like I was watching Iron Man dressed liked Spider-Man. His suit was high tech like Iron Man's, this felt like Iron Man. This is where the film ultimately fails. This is where they should have used less. In certain areas you had the feeling the film was going in the right direction and they would just throw stuff in and destroy the flow. He film would then get back on track and then repeat the process. After awhile the pattern became frustrating and annoying. The pros of this film are only Michael Keaton. He was awesome as Vulture. This was the one time they actually developed a villain other than Loki in the MCU films. The cons of the film are the abundance of changes to Spider-Man lore and the quick ending fight scene. If you love the Disney kid feel, you will most likely love this film. Overall, Spider-Man: Homecoming is a C average, an okay film to watch on a rainy or snowy day. A big disappoint compared to Logan and Wonder Woman that already came out."
"andrualexandros","9","14","23","22 April 2018"," Finally a good Spider-Man
","After 15 Years we finally got a Spider-Man Movie that is so near to perfect than ever. Finally Sony made the right decision to leave all the Work to Marvel."
"Sherrill777","8","14","23","19 November 2017"," Possibly the best live-action Spider-man yet!
","The Good: Okay, let me start by saying that my husband rated this as ""The cheese is strong with this one"". And he's not wrong. It's got its fair share of campiness. Since our hero is 15-ish, he's in high school and you get the typical high school dilemmas (like whether the cute girl will notice our nerdy hero if he uses his alternate identity to smooth the way). High school drama is not my typical movie preference, but it really works well for Peter Parker. It gives him a level of innocence he wears well. <br/><br/>This ties into the way Iron Man is inserted into this movie. I found Tony Stark's inclusion to be a good addition, overall, although for someone who isn't familiar with anything Iron Man related, it might be confusing. That might be an issue in several years as parents have kids watch superhero movies out of order, but right now, I don't find a problem with that. So I liked how adding Iron Man (and the Avengers as a whole) to this reality made several details work better than they might otherwise. It played to several different gags, plus gave Spider-man a sort-of mentor figure for him to try to impress or disappoint or just converse with over the course of the film. However, I will admit that I didn't care for Tony Stark's character here all that much. He isn't the star and comes across as a absent, neglectful parent. I mean, it stays true to his character, I think, but I still didn't like him.<br/><br/>The villain in this story is probably the best villain in all of Super-hero movies to date and earns this movie an extra star just by itself. Finally a bad guy who isn't just a card-board cut-out ""evil dude"" trying to take over the world (or otherwise be evil for the sake of evil). The bad guy has a story arch that shows a realistic motivation and a descent into evilness that feels genuine. The actor who played him did a great job!<br/><br/>The Bad: Probably the one character I didn't care for was Ned, Peter's best friend. He's not from the comics, and was probably created so Spider-man had someone to talk to, but I didn't care for how he constantly pushed Peter to do things he didn't want to. While not intentionally written that way, he came across to me as almost bullying with the level of peer pressure he exerted. <br/><br/>Mom View: Overall, I really enjoyed this. If the writers had held back on the language a bit more, I'd have been even happier. As it is, it's probably appropriate for about an 11 year old and up."
"Marthian80","7","14","23","17 November 2017"," Very entertaining Spider-Man movie and good addition to the MCU
","I enjoy most of the Marvel MCU and was interested what they would do with Spider-Man after he showed up briefly in Civil War. The previous Spider-man movies were 'okay' for me (or even awful), so it could only get better!<br/><br/>The movie starts with showing the aftermath of the 'Battle for New York' that was the epic final of the first Avenger movie. We meet salvage worker Adrian Toomes (Michael Keaton) who leads a team to take apart the alien invaders machinery. After some experiments, Adrian and hit teams learns how to create powerful weapons from the alien wreckage to sell to criminals. But shortly after this discovery, his team is shutdown and the salvage is taken over by a company hired by Tony Stark. We then fast forward 8 years in time were we see the videos Peter Parker made on his trip to Berlin to help Iron Man fight off Captain America. We learn that after Berlin, Peter was allowed to keep the suit which he puts on every day after school to fight (light) crime in New York. He desperately wants to fight with the other Avengers and spams the phone of Happy (Tony Stark's assistant) everyday, but he hears nothing in response. When Peter gets in contact with criminals that bought the alien weapons from 'the Vulture' Adrian Toomes, things start to get more interesting for Peter. But will he be able to stop the Vulture without messing up his high school life to much? And is he truly ready to become part of the Avengers?<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this interpretation of Spider-Man, it was light with a lot of humor and good action sequences. I liked that the whole 'origin story' was skipped because we have seen that two times already, it just focuses on how Peter deals with combining high-school and his aspirations to become a super hero. In my opinion Tom Holland is a much better choice for Spider-Man then Toby McQuire or Andrew Garfield. Toby looked like a whiny little kid to me and Andrew is a way to serious actor to play in a comic-book movie. Tom fits this role as a glove, both his portrayal of Spider-Man and Peter Parker are excellent. Michael Keaton is also excellent in his role as the Vulture villain. Unlike other villains in Marvel movies, he's not pure evil for evil's sake but is just a guy that wants to make loads of money. Robert Downey Jr. is always a pleasure to see on screen and this movie is no exception.<br/><br/>Another good thing this movie does is how it ties in with the MCU. They did a good job in this movie by not involving the whole superhero but keeping the focus on Spider-Man. Also cool to see how high school people live in a world where the Avengers actually do exist. (the Captain America instructional videos are hilarious) There is however a little bit to much high school stuff in it for my taste. Showing Peter asking a girl out for the big dance and showing him in school doing high school things could have left out or toned down a bit. The actors playing the 'high school cast' are mediocre and do not really feel like real people to me.<br/><br/>But the main focus of the movie is still action oriented with amazing effects. Like all Marvel movies it gets a bit CGI heavy and Spider-Man looks a bit to much like a computer game character but overall it's very well done. The movie never bogs down and there are a few surprises to that I didn't see coming.<br/><br/>Spider-Man: Homecoming is another nice addition to the MCU with lots of humor and some good action scenes. It's not the greatest coming book movie but definitely worth checking out."
"jallerbo","4","14","23","13 July 2017"," Least impactful or memorable Spider-Man film yet
","This film is very very standard. If you'd like to see an incredibly average entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, then this is for you. However, if you wish to see a proper homage to the stories and characters that made Spider-Man the flagship hero of Marvel's entire company, you are bound to be beyond disappointed.<br/><br/>One thing this film doesn't understand, is that it's not enough to simply call someone ""Peter Parker"" or ""MJ"" or ""Aunt May"". All of these major characters act nothing like how they have been characterized in other media, and the way they are characterized here is simply not good. Aunt May is reduced to nothing more than an excuse for MILF jokes (which the film includes a fair amount of.) MJ is a somewhat interesting character, but is NOTHING like the Mary Jane we know. She doesn't look like her; she doesn't act like her, so why call her ""MJ""? Flash Thomson is supposed to be a popular bully in this film, there is no reason for him to be popular. The other incarnations of Flash were jocks, so it was easy to understand why they would be popular in a typical high school setting. In this film, he is not handsome, athletic, or smarter than Peter, so there is no reason for him to be considered popular. The only reason he is is because... that's how it's supposed to be. In trying to make this incarnation of Flash different, they made the character make no sense.<br/><br/>Then there's Peter. Now I'm going to preface this by saying Tom Holland is not a bad actor, and I think with the right writing and direction he could have pulled off a good Peter Parker. But this film simply does not understand the complexity and integrity of the character. He is not a social reject in this story. Yes he has some nerdy characteristics, but he never gets physically bullied by anyone, unless you count Flash slapping his ass very awkwardly in one scene. Even Peter's most defining characteristic from the comics, his big dorky glasses are absent. That alone would have added so much to help us identify him as Peter Parker, yet they are nowhere to be seen. Speaking of absence, Peter has absolutely no motivation to be a hero in this film. He wasn't bullied, and there is literally no mention Uncle Ben ANYWHERE in the entire film. I'm not saying he had to say his name anywhere, but there is nothing to suggest that Peter is grieving or suffering the intense psychological impact of losing a father figure. Based on the fact that Aunt May also shows no signs of grief in this film and also because she was hitting on Tony Stark in Civil War, I am left to conclude that Uncle Ben DOES NOT EXIST IN THIS UNIVERSE. How can the writers leave out such an essential part of the Spider-Man lore? It's like retelling Star Wars without Obi-Wan. You just couldn't do it. Uncle Ben's death is what makes Peter realize he needs to dedicate his life to making sure no more innocent lives are lost to crime. This film reduces Peter Parker to an annoying kid. Anyone who is familiar with the previous two film series or the comics knows that he is so much more complex and interesting than that.<br/><br/>The plot is okay, but I have to say the climax kind of puzzles me. Spider-Man wants to be a hero. We don't know why, but he really wants to prove himself, even after (SPOILER) his suit is taken away. So how does he show how heroic he is? He stops Vulture from stealing some boxes from Tony Stark. Tony Stark who 1) Probably would be guarding that stuff himself if it's that important, and 2) would most likely not feel that much financial burn from losing a couple of boxes considering he is the richest man in the world. ""But wait, his iron man suit is in there!"" So? He blew up 50 Iron Man suits in Iron Man 3, so they must not matter that much to him. After Spider-Man saves the boxes, Tony Stark is like, ""Oh you saved my stuff, that totally makes up for endangering hundreds of people and destroying public property."" Then Stark gives the suit back.<br/><br/>I guess the most offensive thing this film does is not care. It knows exactly what it is. It's just something to hold us over until the next Avengers movie. The first frame of this film is literally a picture of the Avengers. They are shoehorned into this film so much it's hard not to imagine that the entire point of this movie was just to promote the next Avengers. The film just doesn't care about respectfully portraying the characters in a way that is updated but not alien. It doesn't care about showing us a compelling or interesting story that would stand on its own without all the Avengers references.<br/><br/>I should also mention the effects in this film are not very great, in fact I would even argue the effects in Spider-Man 2 were much better, and that came out over a decade ago. I also didn't care much for the humor in this film, I can't remember laughing out loud at a single joke, which is a problem when there are so many of them.<br/><br/>In short, this is a very standard MCU film, but if you want to see a good Spider-Man film, you should probably just stick to the Raimi movies."
"samer_bhamdouni","6","14","23","12 July 2017"," Good, but not good enough
","I was really looking forward for this movie. I had some really high hopes for it, but unfortunately, Spider-Man Homecoming fails to deliver a satisfying, full, and substantial movie. <br/><br/>One of the main issues of this movie is one that is shared with many MCU movies (recently being Dr. Strange and GotG Vol.2) where comedy takes center stage and casts aside a vibrant, appealing story, a memorable villain, and proper character development.<br/><br/>Peter Parker's main goal is to become an official Avenger and for some reason, the movie treats this motive as a bad idea and instead decides that having Peter Parker, a poor youth from Queens living with his single aunt, be a mini Iron Man with a high tech suit is a great idea and definitely not against what Spider-Man is about at all!<br/><br/>None of the central characters are taken seriously aside from Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Aunt May is treated as a joke as everyone in the movie wants to have sex with her, the Vulture's motivation for becoming a villain definitely has some potential but was poorly executed and rushed, and his sidekick Ned, while not annoying, definitely felt out of place as Spider-Man's sidekick... His sidekick!!! Since when does Spider-Man need a sidekick? Especially early on in his life. And do not get me started on the new version of Flash Thompson... A total embarrassment.<br/><br/>The movie, however, is not all bad. Homecoming does hone in on some elements of Spider-Man where he struggles with his powers and the responsibility that comes with them. Also, Tom Holland definitely is the best Spider-Man so far. <br/><br/>One of the main reasons why I hold Spider-Man as my favorite superhero is because of how cool the web-swinging around New York looks like and how creative the fights can be with his superpowers. Homecoming really shows how much of a rushed product it is with the lack of any creative or even well choreographed battles. The CGI looks unfinished and unpolished and Spider-Man mostly looks like a video-game character, which is unforgivable given how realistic he looked in Spider-Man 2, a movie that came out in 2004... 13 years ago!<br/><br/>Briefly said, Homecoming is definitely not a ""bad"" or ""terrible"" movie per say but it is underwhelming and suffers from your typical MCU flaws. It does little justice to the character and his universe and without spoiling the final scene before the credits start, but let me just tell you that if you hold a shred of respect for Spider- Man and his mythos, you will be greatly disappointed, irritated even."

","Spider-man Homecoming <br/><br/>Do we really need another reboot?<br/><br/>I asked myself this as I settled into my seat. 3D glasses adorned I pondered over other nagging thoughts. If I have to sit through Uncle Ben croaking it in the street again I'm leaving. If I have to watch Peter Parker get bitten by a radioactive spider again I'm asking for my admission fee back! If I'm subjected to the whole Mary Jane romance crap again I'll probably implode right there in my cinema seat!<br/><br/>Thankfully those guys and gals at Marvel must have read my mind. Well done Sony for handing Spidey back to his rightful owner. After all we haven't had a good Spider-man movie since 2004.<br/><br/>Homecoming is a coming of age movie. A Spider-man begins but without the backstory that we've all seen before. Even if you haven't a quick nudge at the geek sat next to you would quickly bring you up to speed. Well done Marvel for taking risks. This time we get to see a teenager struggling with not only his new found abilities but with growing up. Everyday struggles that we can relate to. Let's say Ferris Bueller in spandex! Tom Holland is probably the best incarnation of the character yet. Don't get me wrong Maguire and Garfield are fine actors but they looked more like thirty year olds trying to play a teenager. Holland however fits the Spidey suit perfectly. His performance is so good he's the Peter Parker from the comic that has jumped straight out of the page and on to the big screen. This movie ties in nicely too with the Marvel universe. The use of existing history help set the story for this movie. Bringing me to the villain played wonderfully by Michael Keaton. His character picks at the corpses of the alien debris left in New York from the events of the first Avengers movie. Much like a vulture does. His salvage team are ordered to stop by the very people who caused the damage. This costs Keatons character thousands of dollars and forces him to become the villainous Vulture. He and his cronies adapt the alien technology to create advanced weaponry. Only Spidey can stop him! The worry of including Tony Starks character was soon forgotten as he was used sparingly but effectively. After all I haven't paid to see an Ironman movie. Stark is more of a mentor than major player in this story. Other good points are that the filmmakers address some longstanding Spidey gripes. Like what happens to his webs after he shoots them? I'd hate to be the guy having to clean up after him. Or how does he get around when there's no buildings to swing from?<br/><br/>However it's not all positives here. What happened to his Spidey sense? In this movie he doesn't even notice a fat kid who's sat behind him. I have issues with the suit too. Like I said this isn't an Ironman movie!<br/><br/>Overall though Spider-man Homecoming is a welcome return to form for the wall crawler and well worth a watch."

","The newest adaption/reboot of Marvel's Spiderman is a breath of fresh air for those still suffocating underneath the horror which was ""Amazing Spiderman 2"". Director Jon Watts skillfully creates a world where Peter Parker struggles to finesse his abilities while juggling school and relationships. Actor Tom Holland is a believable teenager (being 20 during filming) and instead of skateboarding his angst away *Cough Amazing Spiderman* he is the nerdy, awkward, gawky kid we expect. There is no sequence where we sigh and watch politely as Uncle Ben is murdered or Aunt May offers sage advice. Rather, We're thrust into the midst of Peter having his powers. Tony Stark is in the movie in exactly the right dose to keep the focus on Parker. Michael Keaton's depiction of the Vulture is a coin toss: Either you agree with his motivation, or you find it unconvincing that he would see turning to crime as the only option. Their fight sequences mercifully don't involve destroying entire cities and killing thousands of citizens, but at the same time it feels a bit TOO low-key and leaves you wanting more. There are tons of Easter- eggs for the inner nerd in you spread throughout the movie. All in all, it's a fresh take on a familiar character and I'm excited to see where this goes..."

"matrix_swatcat","5","14","23","9 July 2017"," Sadly ended up being nothing short of forgettable and feeling more like a Disney Channel exclusive than a Marvel cinematic film.
","Spider-Man: Homecoming takes place post Captain America: Civil War and is predominantly set in Queens but therein lies the problem. While we are very used to seeing Spidey swing around New York City, this change of scenery reducing him to being a glorified neighbourhood watch is hardly exciting. Action sequences were few and far between and the hum drums of Peter Parker's life (although crucial to any Spider-man story) were overemphasised and less than tolerable.<br/><br/>While many are heralding this film for its smaller scale and homeliness, it felt like these very facets were lugging the story down from progressing at a faster pace. The parallels between Peter Parker and his alter-ego were felt on screen in that the tone and pace changed each time he donned the mask and switched back to a being a dramatic piece when we resumed with Parker's life. With a run time of 2 hours and 13 mins, these lulls were felt and boredom often crept in. Tony Stark popped up numerous times as Peter Parker's guiding light and while these scenes were welcomingly entertaining in that they gave true insight into character of Peter Parker, the follow-up scenes of Parker just living his high school life and obsessing over being in Tony Stark's good books often pulled the handbrake on the main plot.<br/><br/>In Homecoming, Peter Parker is merely 16, considerably younger than his previous on-screen renditions. It must be said that Tom Holland at 21 years of age plays a brilliant Spider-Man, but as a 16 year old, the older more mature versions of the character are sorely missed. This creative decision to have such a young Spider-Man snag the interest of a younger audience in an already aging fan-base (seeing as how Guardians of the Galaxy does the opposite by hitting the sweet spot for 80s and 90s kids) stinks of Disney's meddling and honestly has potentially ruined Spider-Man's Marvel Cinematic Universe debut. As the film panders to the 12‚Äì16 audience in the cinema, it simultaneously tries to satisfy the adult audience only to end up with a tonally jumbled quirky mess that is neither here nor there and almost devoid of humor despite its numerous attempts.<br/><br/>Action sequences in Homecoming boil down to about 4 major events which all things considered on paper shouldn't be an issue as Iron Man only had a handful of action as well. Although the action sequences are well executed and high-budget enough, they sadly don't stand out among Spider-man's predecessors. Except for the climax, most of the action sequences are small scaled. This only played further into how this film felt more like the safe and calculated decisions of a straight-to-TV film rather than a feature. As far as the climatic boss-fight of the film goes, as interesting and action packed as it was, by that point you're driven to a point of boredom that it is sadly too little too late.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy and even Marc Webb's double presented us with plenty of memorably iconic scenes. From Spider-Man grabbing Mary-Jane and dodging a slow motion car hurtling through a coffee shop to dodging clock pieces being hurled by an eight-armed Doc Oc on a building facade, these are just some of the Spider-Man action sequences that remain memorable and entertaining. Homecoming on the other hand disappointingly fails to stand out and take its place beside its predecessors given its smaller scale. Given the fact that an origin story was avoided in this film, the excuse that it is the first of a long series is not one that I think can apply to this instalment.<br/><br/>It was a major controversy when Donald Glover (who was used as a model for a ethnic Spider- man revamp) campaigned to be the new Spider-Man and was denied the role. While Glover does appear in Homecoming in an under-utilised cameo, the suspected reason as to why he did not get the role of Spider-Man was probably because Spider-Man is traditionally white. Mary- Jane on the other hand, is now a brunette woman of colour as opposed to the traditional redhead that we have grown accustomed to. I wonder why if Spider-Man cannot be black, Mary- Jane instead can be ethnic. While I personally have no issue with an ethic Mary-Jane, I have always been of the view that changing genders and ethnicities in this way is a lazy attempt to change what is traditionally canon instead of revamp the source material (as has been done in the Marvel camp recently Thor is now female in the comics and justifiably so). Instead of forcing the illegitimate change of a character in this manner, it is far more credible to write in a new character from the source material like Donald Glover's Spider-Man. Better yet, the studio could have easily written a new character which is birthed from her on-screen appearance much like Harley Quinn's origin was from the Batman Animated Series as opposed to a comic book.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the final issue with Spider-man: Homecoming is the issue of canon. Not even going into the fact that Peter Parker is basically using a wonder-suit akin to Iron Man's with webs, the essence of Spider-Man was forgotten. Throughout Homecoming we see this version of Peter grovelling to Tony Stark to take a seat at the table with the Avengers. But, honestly, a true Spider-Man wouldn't care less given the string by which his life is already hanging on. With an already full plate of crime-fighting, school, a crumbling relationship with a girl way out of his league, his photography job for the Bugle, and putting in face time with an already suspecting and lonely aunt, the praise of another hero is hardly his concern. Yes, I understand that a 16- year-old would only relish to play with the big leagues but it felt like Homecoming, in dwelling on this, missed the bigger picture."
"arnieiam","Null","14","23","8 July 2017"," Another harmless entertaining flick in the MCU that Sony should be happy with
","See Sony you get to have your cake and eat it by giving Spider-Man back to Marvel. I haven't done a review in a while because I get really defeated with typing my thoughts out and there ends up being a lot to say. But this film was a pretty shallow entertaining flick brought to again by Marvel.<br/><br/>And like an MCU film it hits those same beats, frenetic action sequences, a rich colour palate (a huge step up from the Webb films by the way), tons of cgi, and ohh the incessant humour.<br/><br/>Overall I liked this film, but I wasn't so excited about this like I was as an 11-year old back in 2002 seeing my favourite superhero come on screen for the first time. I liked the fact that they didn't rehash the origin story. This time Spider-Man is a small player in a much bigger Avengers laden world and he's figuring out what his purpose is. The villain in this film is actually interesting which is a rarity in Marvel. There is very little setup for future films and it actually is pretty self contained. And they actually goofed on the fact that him swinging around to transport himself is hardly possible outside Manhattan.<br/><br/>Now onto gripes, which are there but it didn't take me out of the film like the Webb films did. Spider-Man's suit is way too tricked out with Tony Stark's gizmos, which makes him too much like Iron-Man and not really himself, which is a plot point but still. And it occurred to me: where's his Spider sense? Isn't that a key component to this character? <br/><br/>Anyways just watch this. Have fun. It's a huge step up from the Amazing Spider-Man films but still doesn't stir the emotions of the first two Raimi films. I think I'm done here. It's good. Have a watch. Or don't. Up to you. I made a review. Hope you found it useful."

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","15","25","11 July 2017"," ""Homecoming"" rediscovers Spider-Man's roots without retelling his origins
","No Marvel superhero has been through the ordeal of Spider-Man on the big screen. Peter Parker's first two films practically launched the modern superhero genre, but then after creative issues, Sony rebooted him, and audiences were less than enthused. Probably with much reluctance, Sony and Marvel Studios reached terms on a co- production to let Spidey play with his superfriends in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, a true homecoming that turned out as good as either studio ‚Äì and the fans ‚Äì could have imagined.<br/><br/>""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" returns Peter Parker to his teenage roots as well. Played with a refreshing youthful energy by Tom Holland, Parker is presented as a sort of Avenger-in-training whom Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) has taken under his wing. In essence, the film depicts Parker's training wheels period, learning what it takes to be a hero and earning the bumps and bruises that come with it.<br/><br/>What's notably missing from that summary is Spider-Man's origin story; a wise decision given that retelling it seemed to cast a shadow over ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" films. ""Homecoming"" story creators and initial screenwriters Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley still take elements of Spider-Man's roots, but choose instead to focus on how a teenager might approach superheroism. Without being a slave to that spider bite and Uncle Ben storyline, which audiences were tired of anyway, the film gets a lot more time to develop the character in more innovative, meaningful ways.<br/><br/>""Homecoming"" spends significant time on Parker's high school life, namely his academic decathlon team, a diverse group that includes his best friend, Ned (Jacob Batalon), his rival/bully, Flash (Tony Revolori), the odd girl that kind of stalks him, Michelle (Zendaya), and his crush, Liz (Laura Carrier). But Peter's academic dedication is lacking thanks to his ""Stark internship."" When he discovers criminals using odd/dangerous weapons in his neighborhood in Queens, he goes on a bit of a crusade for good, despite Tony Stark's warnings, and his dual identities become more and more difficult to maintain.<br/><br/>The story allows director Jon Watts to pursue superhero film meets coming-of-age movie. Although John Hughes is a lofty comparison (one the film tries to literally make in one amusing sequence), Watts' film has the right playful, loose and carefree spirit that echoes the attitudes of its hero at this stage in his journey.<br/><br/>In the scene with a Hughes movie reference, for example, Spider-Man is clumsily barreling through a suburban neighborhood, which is all the more funny to those who understand how suburbia is not conducive in the least to Spider-Man's abilities. Much like how it bypassed the origin story, ""Homecoming"" smartly recognizes other ways the audience is familiar with Spider-Man and pushes the character's boundaries in exciting ways.<br/><br/>The element of the suit coming from Stark Industries might deviate from the character's origins, but it's a device, literally and figuratively, that keeps us on our toes. At one point, Peter finds a way to hack the suit and activate its full capabilities, which allows for a lot of fun surprises. More importantly, however, is the humor and challenge of Spider-Man figuring out how to use them as a kid who has gotten in way over his head.<br/><br/>The greatest strengths of ""Homecoming"" are these subtle deviations from and fresh takes on the conventions of both previous ""Spider- Man"" movies and other superhero movies. No example is more prominent than the villain, Adrian Toomes (Michael Keaton), a new MCU-take on the villain Vulture. A blue-collar boss motivated by family and being cheated as the little guy, he and Spider-Man develop an interesting relationship that borrows a bit from the 2002 film's Norman Osborn character. In today's landscape on omnipotent, power- hungry, world domination villains, the intimacy here is a breath of fresh air.<br/><br/>Consequently, the action stays small scale: a truck heist, a bank robbery, a Washington Monument rescue and a Staten Island ferry fiasco. Rather than resorting to city-leveling, these sequences are tightly constructed with greater ingenuity, almost a throwback to the way things were before bloated visual effects budgets. This choice also hearkens to the storytelling goals of the movie, one of which is to bring Spider-Man back to his ""friendly neighborhood Spider-Man"" roots. One would think bringing Spider-Man into the MCU would do the opposite, but the story smartly contains it while allowing it to feel as though it's part of that bigger universe.<br/><br/>""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" doesn't revolutionize the genre or Spider- Man, but as the third iteration of the webslinger in 15 years, its creators understood the importance of stepping back and identifying how a new Spider-Man could both emerge and thrive in a bustling comic hero movie landscape. They figured out how to restore the character's unique fingerprint for Spider-Man's sake and for our sake. With Holland only 21 and the character still in high school, Spider-Man now has the chance to mature and grow both in terms of story and as the genre and box-office dominating hero he's always been.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

"sujanfaster","8","15","25","11 July 2017"," Homecoming like a breeze
","It was obvious that things were going to be different when MARVEL Studio took the rights of Spiderman from Sony. MARVEL had to step in to save the sinking franchise as it seemed Sony wasn't really sure of what it was doing after The Amazing Spiderman 2. Most were treated to a pleasant surprise in Captain America: Civil War with a much younger version of Spiderman than the earlier films. Spiderman: Homecoming is a refreshing take to match the taste of current MARVEL audiences without compromising the originality of the character.<br/><br/>In this movie, there is no dark origin story of the character Peter Parker. He is mentored by Tony Stark and with Stark's help Peter Parker fights neighborhood crimes under the so called 'Stark Internship'. However, things start to take a turn when Peter Parker discovers a gang of criminals lead by the Vulture, utilizing hi-tech weapons which were recovered from the intergalactic battle in the Avengers. He tries to take them on his own, which hampers his relationship with Stark and he loses the internship. The rest of the movie is how Spiderman proves himself to regain the trust of Stark and also stop the Vulture from doing further damage.<br/><br/>The 'MARVELisation' of the Spiderman is clearly evident in most of the scenes. Spiderman wears the suit made by Stark Enterprises, which can do things that can blow everyone's minds. Director Jon Watts also makes sure not to disappoint hardcore Spiderman fans by, bringing back the simple old suit in the end. The humour and sarcasm totally reminds us of the recent MARVEL movies which is no surprise. The role of Aunt May has been as glamorous as ever just like other female characters in the recent MARVEL universe. The action sequences are crisp and are really worth a watch in 3D. However the intensity of the film is quite low compared to any other MARVEL films these days, which was slightly disappointing for me. <br/><br/>There is one word to describe Tom Holland as Spiderman: Adorable. Marisaa Tomei as a very toned down Aunt May will surely raise eyebrows as she does in the movie itself. Robert Downey Junior might not have much to play as the mentor Stark in the movie, but he is as cool as ever. Jon Favreau as Happy Hogan plays a significant part. Jacob Batalon as Spiderman's best mate Ned manages to tickle some funny bones. Although the negative role Vulture is not so well written, Michael Keaton dominates the part. The movie also has a very diverse casting and is very evident in the characters from Peter Parker's high school played by young actors Tony Revolori, Zendaya and Laura Harrier.<br/><br/>Spiderman: Homecoming is a pleasant 'homecoming' for MARVEL's spidy. It will be very interesting to see how MARVEL takes his character forward to the next Avengers' movies as the rights for the Spiderman sequel is back with Sony again."
"scandinavianmail","8","15","25","10 July 2017"," Comic book Spiderman makes a comeback
","This thoroughly entertaining new take on the long-loved Marvel hero unexpectedly succeeds without taking itself too seriously nor turning the story into a silly gag- fest.<br/><br/>As the title character, Tom Holland naturally needs to carry the film, and he does it with all the youthful energy and charm he can possibly through at the camera, not leaving a stone unturned to sell the role. It is a bit of a stretch to have him play a 15-year-old, but the only time it took me out of the movie was when he literally claimed he's 15 years old. Should have cut that one out.<br/><br/>This incarnation of Spiderman is tonally as meta as Deadpool, although not as outrageous and violent. A hugely popular duo among comic book crowd, these two feel instantly such a perfect fit on screen that there could well be a joint Deadpool/Spiderman outing in the pipeline. Well, at least as soon as Peter becomes -hmm- ""legal"".<br/><br/>There is really not much negative to say about this delightful Spiderman reboot. Those worrying to see yet another uncle Ben death scene need to rest assured he's not even mentioned in the movie. Even the traditional Marvel shortcoming, a convincing villain, works this time around, thanks to the quietly menacing but not heartless or rootless performance by Micheal Keaton, getting yet another chance to fly on the screen.<br/><br/>The one thing to complain about is that I was a bit unimpressed by the score. It didn't feel in tune with the movie, often rushing to underline emotions when no underlining was needed."
"danielharden","8","15","25","9 July 2017"," Spider-Boy
","Spider-Man is arguably the most relatable and beloved superhero of all time, I know this is true is for me. When Sam Raimi first brought him to the big screen in 2002, the film had the biggest opening weekend for any film at the time. Now 15 years, 5-6 movies, 3 actors and 2 reboots later, we now are graced with Spider-Man: Homecoming. Directed by Jon Watts and stars Tom Holland as the third Spider-Man, Michael Keaton as the Vulture and Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man, Spider-Man: Homecoming tells the story of an overly eager, adolescent Peter Parker, who is done with being the bridesmaid (your friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man), and thus desperately attempts to impress Tony Stark in the hopes of becoming an Avenger. The film is a fun addition to the Marvel universe that is by far the best Spider-Man film since Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 2 (2004).<br/><br/>Spider-Man: Homecoming is unlike any Spider-Man film before it. It is crossover film in more ways than one. Yes the film has Iron Man in it, but it also has Spider-Man face off with former Batman, Birdman now Vulture, Michael Keaton. Jokes aside, this film is unique in the sense that it does its own thing and doesn't follow in 'The Amazing Spider-Man's footsteps by retelling the classic Uncle Ben origin story. The film fortunately does what Spider-Man 2 did so well, getting right into Peter's life as Spider-Man. I swear if we got a third origin story that would be a last straw, I'm sorry Spidey. Also in the same light as Spider-Man 2, Spider-Man: Homecoming plays with the question ""can Peter Parker be Spider-Man without the suit?"" I personally enjoyed the rather realistic way this was handled and this really helped warm you to Tom Holland's Spider-Man as a person with faults, thus juxtaposing the way audiences related to Tobey Maguire's relatable, good guy nerd Spider-Man.<br/><br/>As I've compared Spider-Men and Spider-Man films I might as well cut right to it. Tom Holland is a great Spider-Man, he embodies the naive ambition, rebellion and awkwardness of a young teenage boy and did what I believe to be the right way to approach Spider-Man, that is playing Peter Parker first and Spider-Man second. People love Spider-Man not because he can swing from a web and climb walls, well not just because of that. People love Spider-Man because Peter Parker is a relatable character. When I was growing up Spider-Man wasn't just a hero, he was a figure of representation and therefore was MY hero. Although Tom Holland will never be better than Tobey Maguire in my eyes due to personal history, he is a surprisingly close second. I appreciate Holland's approach to my childhood icon, and I think it's safe to say, he was definitely better than Andrew Garfield. As well as Tom Holland, Michael Keaton also did an excellent job as the films antagonist, The Vulture. His story was understandable and his character was given a surprising amount of depth for an MCU villain. Keaton's Vulture stands out above pretty much all MCU movie villains (except Loki of course) and would feel more at home in the Netflix shows alongside Cottonmouth, Kilgrave and Kingpin.<br/><br/>My only criticisms surround the high school dramedy parts of the film. Although, a lot of the comedy that came from this was pretty funny and so I can't fault it too much, I could however have done without the teen romance sub plot with Lizzie. Again, I understand that it does become crucial to the plot and nicely reflected the Osbournes over for dinner scene in Spider-Man (2002), this being said, It just felt clich√© overall and seeing as this is a rather fresh take on Spider-Man, the typical high school romance took away some of the films freshness, in my opinion. Also I felt that maybe the character Ned and Michelle could have swapped positions. Ned just didn't do much for me by being in the film, I feel Michelle and Peter could have had better banter and that Michelle could've acted as Peter's reality check. I do see however that Michelle may become important in the sequel so we shall see.<br/><br/>Finally, I get this being an Avengers crossover movie, Tony Stark being a father figure to Peter, as well as, a massive payday for RDJ, but there is a part of me that feels this is Marvel trying to make every superhero movie a 'Mini Avengers' movie, ever since the success of Captain America: Winter Soldier. This is a Spider-Man film, but it also isn't as it is a constant reminder that the Avengers exist and have a movie next year. Part of me would have liked an solo Spider-Man movie with references to the universe similar to the Marvel/Netflix shows, which to be honest it does do, but at the end of the day, I'm just thankful they have finally made a good Spider-Man film after 13 years of trying.<br/><br/>To conclude, Spider-Man: Homecoming is a fun and surprisingly relatable superhero movie that ends Spider-Man's bad movie streak. Its an entertaining action and teen movie that understands its character, as well as, what made the last three movies not so great. Sure its another 'Mini Avengers' movie as well as a typical teen film, but with brilliant acting, writing, directing and a real sense of humour, Spider-Man: Homecoming does my childhood icon justice and satisfies on many levels."

It is one of my favorite Spider-Man movies, second only to Spiderman: Into The Spiderverse (although there are several Spider-Man movies announced that are coming in the near future so who knows). If you like comedies, action, the MCU, or Spider-Man, then I would highly recommend watching this movie. I would also recommend watching all the deleted/extended scenes and bonus features if you can.

"Quinoa1984","8","17","29","8 July 2017"," does a lot as a friendly neighborhood mega-franchise; one of the better 'reboots'
","For the most part, if you were among those that saw Spider-Man/Peter Parker appear in Civil War and found him entertaining and, more to the point, *right* as that character and icon, then you will like him all the more in his first movie in this iteration. It's amazing to think that this is the sixth Spider-Man movies in 15 years, and yet this is the first in over a decade that understands this character, in large part making close to the comic books (I haven't read them religiously, but it seems to follow pretty close to the Ultimate run at the least, if not others). I don't know if every action scene is terribly original, but every one has massive stakes for Parker, and yet at the same time they're not the usual apocalyptic, end-of-the-world scenarios that sometimes can make a super-hero movie feel too big, even if the stakes are still strong. Everything is down to the personal here with Parker, and even more than the Raimi movies these get right the high school, awkward teenager part of Parker down pat.<br/><br/>Now, was this all even necessary? I don't know, and that may be cause for debate among people for a long time. I got to look at what's put in front of me to say whether it works or not as its own thing; the previous try by Sony to get Spider-Man back into theaters after getting rid of Raimi, Amazing Spider-Man, felt tired and had its moments amid a very spotty story. I'm not even sure if it's necessarily that Marvel Studios *solely* could have brought Parker et al back, or then some, to former glory, but I think with Civil War being the dipping of the toes into the pool and this being the big dive and 1000-meter lap, that they got it right as they could. It all comes down to what makes any of these gigantic corporate products work, regardless of if it's Marvel or DC or whoever: are the actors convincing enough to bring the characters to life, and does the writing do right by them with a story that makes sense and characters that give them something to do? <br/><br/>Holland found just the right note in Civil War as like a half of the time innocent-looking puppy of a teenager, the kind that we almost don't want to see get hurt, vulnerable and caring and showing the conflicts so perfectly that Parker has to deal with everyday in his balance as just a regular kid in extraordinary circumstances... but, other half of the time, he can certainly mouth-off and be convincing in that way that Spider-Man just was int the comics (that doesn't mean the comics are sacrosanct or anything, that they *had* to do that to get it right, it's merely to point that this Parker is a wise-ass but funny as hell at doing it, even down to a moment in a montage early on when he stops a guy stealing a bike). Meanwhile, the writers give Parker a best-friend/comic relief, a tired trope that feels totally revitalized here because a) the kid he's paired with is wonderfully dead-pan and yet excitable (kudos to Jacob Batalon as Ned Leeds getting it right), and b) he proves himself useful... maybe oddly, a lot, conveniently useful for a teenager, but I can suspend disbelief for a little while.<br/><br/>And then there's Keaton; is he used properly, given how damn talented he is? Yes, but only up to a point. There's some moments, like a very tense exchange with the hero in a car, that have a crisp intensity that Keaton can just turn on as if it's nothing. Other times, he's having to work more in what the plot requires, and under his Vulture get-up - obviously, without question, right, a meta-comment in an ironic way regarding BIRDMAN - we don't get to see as much of it. It's in the third act he gets to flex his chops the most, without saying exactly why it's a wonderful twist that we don't see coming but makes sense. Even when he is in the midst of certain story continuity things (an 8 year jump is a bit odd, but again, we try to let it go on q first watch), he is... Michael Keaton. He's a lot of fun to watch.<br/><br/>It's hard I think for me to fully analyze this right away as some profound work of art that may have more depth that needs a dive in. That may be all good now for the Raimi movies, but that's looking back over a decade. This is still too fresh, and the only thing I can say is that the writing of the story if 90% of it all tight and gives Parker and Spider-Man a solid, if a little predictable, arc as far as his hero's journey, and the dialog is consistently comedic. I found myself laughing far more than in any previous Spider-Man entry, and that's the key to its success: it knows it's silly in a way, or at least Parker recognizes it, and while the MCU is known for doing that (this year with GotG most of all), this feels even sillier. It knows it. We are let in on the fun. Despite any nitpicks and misgivings, and there are more I won't mention (one involving a character reveal that is right out of, of all things, Dark Knight Rises), it's among the better summer blockbusters in years because of that. 8.5/10"

","I haven't seen ALL the Marvel superhero movies but as of late I have found them to be boring, lacking in any real characters, even the action sequences seem boring (on average). When Iron Man came out in 2008 I was soooooo stoked to finally be getting a decent super hero movie. Then Marvel repeated themselves over and over and over again.<br/><br/>Previous Spiderman movies have all come up short. Some had ok leads, ok bad guys, ok support cast. Homecoming seems better in every category. I think they finally found the right person to play Peter Parker/Spiderman. I was really skeptical when they said Vulture was going to be the main bad guy I was dissapointed. He was one of the lamest villians from the comics. So I avoided this movie having been disspointed so many times. Michael Keaton was perfect for the role.<br/><br/>The only thing I had a beef with was the corny boat scene, which was shown in the trailers. You slice a boat in half, you aren't going to just push it back together before it sinks. That was really dumb and it felt lazy on part of the writers.

","Welcome Home, Spiderman! Nice to see you back! However, you weren't really gone for that long. After all, there has five films featuring him in the last 15 years, with two reboots. You were pretty much, everywhere. So, coming into 'Spider-Man: Homecoming"", I was really, wasn't looking forward to your movie. I was really, feeling the superhero fatigue, after the last two films about you, 2012's 'The Amazing Spiderman' & 2014's 'The Amazing Spiderman 2' kinda disappointed me at parts. Nor, was I looking forward to watching the 'The Sinister Six' spin-off film, which eventually got cancelled by Sony Pictures, but after hearing that Sony was allowing you to join the Marvel Studios Cinematic Universe in a cameo appearance in 2016's 'Captain America: Civil War'. It got some of my Spiderman sense tingling. However, I was still, a bit off-putting on the fact that I have to watch, yet another retelling of the Friendly Neighborhood Spiderman comics, origin story. I really had mixed feelings, coming into this film, because of that; but thank goodness, after watching, this movie, directed by Jon Watts, I felt astonishment that the film avoid the tiresome exposition on how Peter Parker (Tom Holland) became bitten by a radioactive/genetically-altered spider to become, Spider-Man. It totally skip it to tell something new. Now, Spider-Man is, like Iron-Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr), in which, his suit gives him, most of his powers. It gave the character, a lot of new abilities and move-sets, such as controlling drone-size flying spiders, and choosing different types of web projectiles, while also somewhat limiting him, in his ability to trust his natural instincts & problem solving skills. It was a unique approach to adapting the character from the comics. Still, the action was not that memorable. I thought, the film could had done, a lot better. It was a little too CGI heavy. Also, it was a bit, odd to see Spiderman talk to an intelligence assistant named 'Karen' (Voiced by Jennifer Connelly) built into the suit about life issues. It really felt, like I was watching a superhero version of 2013's 'Her', at times. Still, I was deeply surprised, how little, the film talk about 'Uncle Ben' passing. You would think, that would affect his life, deeply, but there is no mention of that, at all. Because of that, the character was a lot more enjoyable and charming, but sadly, it also made Tom Holland's Peter, paper-thin. There was barely any character depth, besides the fact, that is Pete is an outsider in high school. I would like to see the sequel, tackle more intense & emotional issues than coming to age issues like him, trying to get with a girl and being popular in school. Another problem, with the film, is the fact, that they focus, a little too much on characters from the Iron Man franchise. The fact, that the villain, Adrian Toomes/Vulture (Michael Keaton) has more of a grudge against Iron Man than the title character, makes Spiderman seem, less of the main hero. Don't get me wrong, you can still have the salvager turned into an arms trafficker, but have it, relate more to what Spiderman did, than the Avengers. It would make the film have more stakes. Still, Michael Keaton was great in the role. I just wish, his character, was a little more sinister and darker. As for the supporting cast, it was mostly a miss for me. I found, the classmates of Peter, to be really annoying. Some, good examples is the characters of Ned (Jacob Batalon) & Michelle (Zendaya). There were very unfunny. Some of the jokes, like not wanting to go to Washington Monument due to it, being built by slave-labor was cringe-worthy. It really didn't help the film. If anything, it slow the film, down. Also, the fact, that most of the students, couldn't tell, that he was Spider-Man, is really hard to believe. Thank Goodness, not all the humor was awful. I did like some of the hand-held V-Blog exchanges, between Peter and Happy Hogan (Jon Favereau) & the hot jokes with Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) were kinda funny. Also, some of the cameos in the movie like Chris Evans, StanLee, and Gwyneth Paltrow was nice to see. As for the love-interest, Liz Allen (Laura Harrier). She was very forgettable for the most part, besides the big twist toward the end. It's just seem weird to see the writers, not use, the more famous, Mary Jane Watson or Gwen Stacy, instead. This film is by far, the weakest, in the love-department. As for the music,I like, how much, composer Michael Giacchino interweave a new update version of the original 1960's cartoon TV show theme song to the movie. Still, I like the Danny Elfman's 2002's version, better. I would wish, they reused that. Anyways, unlike this movie, I will be looking forward to Spiderman's appearance in the next MCU movie, 'The Avengers: Infinity Wars'. That's for sure. As for the next single feature. I have high hopes that it will do well, as well. Overall: 'Spiderman: Homecoming' spins a mean enjoyable web. It was entertaining for the most part. Even with some flaws, I highly recommended watching it."
"mistela67","8","16","27","11 July 2017"," Best thing about this movie is that...
","...it pisses off the racists. Anything that gets them whining like drama queens and their panties in a twist tickles me pink. So all the white characters that morphed into the ""other"" category are completely fine with me. You don't like it, tough s**t!<br/><br/>Now, onto the movie. I grew up with a different take on Spider Man, and this version in my mind of him differs from what this movie presented. I'm not keen on a teenage superhero. It just doesn't work for me. I'd much rather see Spider man somewhere around that 19-23 year old range. 15 years old is waaay too young. But, I understand why they did this. It's simple. This movie has progressed 8 years from Civil War, so I assume the next time Spidey gets to the big screen, he'll be firmly in that age range I expect him to be. Starting him off as a 15 year old gives him a few more future movies where he'll being just out of AARP range.<br/><br/>I also envision Spider Man as being bigger and badder. I'm not talking Capt America physique, but not a short little pip squeak either. Spidey wasn't even taller than his pseudo girlfriend, or even MJ, his future love interest (who happens to be black...HA, had to get one in on the racists). I guess I like my superheroes truly super; I attribute that to years of reading the comics, where superheroes are buff and cut by default.<br/><br/>Another issue I had with this movie was Spider Man's reliance on Iron Man. Now, I get that Iron Man serves as something of a mentor and liason to the Avengers, but too much of Iron Man's technology rubbed off on Spider Man. This makes Spidey more of a hybrid than an actual, skilled, fighting machine with super moves, above average smarts, and spider-sense. Spider Man is actual quite capable in the comics, easily a tough match for anyone. In this movie, not so much, and especially not with Iron Man's help.<br/><br/>All in all, it's an okay movie. Could be better. Recommended to watch, and then top off the night reading all the online bytching from loser bigots spewing their favorite word over and over...can you say PC ,PC, PC ,PC, PC, PC, PC...(they do).<br/><br/>8/10"
"mitchell5954","8","16","27","10 July 2017"," Spiderman's Solo Debut in the MCU
","Spiderman Homecoming is the long-awaited Spiderman movie from Marvel Studios. This is the sixth Spiderman film and the third Spiderman continuity in the last fifteen years. That's crazy! After the disappointment that was the Amazing Spiderman 2, Sony was finally desperate enough to share the rights to Spiderman with Marvel Studios. Many have been waiting for Spiderman's big solo debut in the MCU. Was it worth the wait? In my opinion it was.<br/><br/>Is Homecoming the best Spiderman film to date? In my honest opinion, no. I think Sam Raimi's Spiderman 2 is still the best Spiderman film we've gotten so far. I might even enjoy the first Spiderman movie by Raimi more, even though Homecoming is objectively a better film. Homecoming is still a good movie though. It's definitely better than Spiderman 3 and TASM films.<br/><br/>With that being said, I think Tom Holland is the best portrayal of Spiderman we've seen yet. I like Tobey McGuire alright, didn't care for Andrew Garfield, but really like Holland. He embodies Peter's shy insecure side and his confident witty side as Spiderman perfectly.<br/><br/>The plot is very simple. A villain who calls himself the vulture is stealing and building alien tech, left behind from the Avengers, to sell on the black market. Spiderman must stop him while dealing with the trials of high school life and try to prove himself to his mentor Tony Stark.<br/><br/>It hits all the beats of a typical MCU film. It's lighthearted and fun, but gets serious when it needs to. It's your typical stop the bad guy shtick. If you've gotten sick of the Marvel formula you might be bored by this film, but if it's a formula that works there's no need to fix it. Plus, Spiderman, more than any other marvel character, fits with this formula. This is very much how the classic Spiderman stories were told.<br/><br/>What works about this movie, besides Tom Holland's performance, was the villain played by Michael Keaton. As MCU villains go he's really good. He's not my favorite. I still think Loki and Zemo are the best MCU villains so far, but Vulture is still fun. This is to be expected, as Spiderman has one of the best rogues gallery in all of comics, along with Batman. I also like this film's version of Mary Jane. It's a very unique take on the character, and she was fun.<br/><br/>The effects naturally were great. You can always expect above average effects in an MCU property. The action was also fun. I still think the action Spiderman 2 and the first Spiderman was the best, but the action here was definitely on par, if not better than the fight scenes in TASM movies.<br/><br/>Now we get to my personal gripes with the movie. First of all, with the exception of MJ, I felt the supporting cast was weak. I did not care for Peter's best friend, who was the obvious comic relief. Occasionally he got a laugh, but mostly I found him irritating. The love interest is generic and forgettable. The other supporting characters aren't even worth mentioning.<br/><br/>The film was a bit too long as well, and felt very padded in places. Not to mention the story is entirely predictable. You know pretty much how everything will play out. The music was there, but it was not that memorable at all. I had the same issue with the score in TASM movies. The music in the Raimi films was amazing and you could easily listen to it by itself.<br/><br/>Overall, if you were excited for Spiderman's solo outing in the MCU this film should give you what you were expecting. Tom Holland is the best Spiderman yet, the villain is fun, and the action and effects are above average. The supporting cast is weak, and the film can drag, but the film is still a really solid Spiderman and MCU film."

","Grade: A-<br/><br/>In a Nutshell: Another Spider-Man? Really? I rolled my eyes when I saw that yet one more Spider-Man origin movie was being made...6 movies in 15 years with 3 different lead actors. BUT, this isn't exactly an origin movie and it offers some fresh new takes on the story that you just might get a kick out of. <br/><br/>Complete with a dental retainer, Spanish quiz, and best-friend secret handshake, Peter Parker is a goofy teenager who struggles with the ""Training Wheel Protocol"" as he learns how to become a true superhero and Avenger. With plenty of action and humor, this is another effective arrow in Marvel's growing cinematic quiver.<br/><br/>This new version of Spider-Man, directed by Jon Watts, really captures the innocence, naivete, and adolescence of everyday teenage life. It offers an impressive balance between superhero and high schooler. One of the movie posters does a great job of illustrating that.<br/><br/>Uplifting theme: ""Times are changing. It's time we change too."" ‚Äì Adrian Toomes (This idea also explains the existence of this new Spider-man remake)<br/><br/>Take time to figure out who you are. Service, love, friendship, family.<br/><br/>Things I liked: Tom Holland has the 15 year old personality to offer a unique perspective on this young superhero, as well as the 6-pack abs to make you believe he can be a powerful Avenger. I love Michael Keaton in anything he does. He had to get a kick out of playing this flying role as The Vulture, after winning awards for his quasi superhero character in Birdman. They did a great job with creating a backstory and motivation for The Vulture. He's a scavenger, which is what vultures do. I loved all of the different features on Spiderman's enhanced suit given to him by the tech genius Tony Stark. ""Enhanced Interrogation Protocol."" Ha ha Spider drone. I hate spiders, but that drone was pretty cool. Peter Parker says to his Spanish teacher, ""Me gusta hacer la tarea."" There aren't any subtitles, so I thought you might like to know what he said. ""I like to do homework."" Ha ha There's a short clip from Marvel's Captain America: Civil War to remind you where we first saw this new Tom Holland version of Spider-man. The 3D really pays off during the Washington, DC scenes, as well as any time Peter Parker is scaling buildings. Is the US Academic Decathlon a real thing? Yes, it is! www.usad.org Check out the dramatic backsplash in Adrian Toomes' kitchen. It doesn't have anything to do with the story; I just thought it was interesting. Cool cloaking feature on Tony Stark's plane. I love that Marvel always includes a cameo performance by creator Stan Lee. I get a kick out of seeing what oddball lines they choose to give him. In this film, he says, ""Don't make me come down there, you punk!"" ha ha Speaking of Stan Lee, he has always said that people relate so much to Spiderman, because he's just a normal kid with normal problems. That's exactly what makes this new version of Spiderman so likable. Was the National Monument really built by slaves as Michelle suggests? While there is no definite evidence that proves she's right, there are quite a few other national monuments and famous buildings in Washington, D.C. that were. The guard at the monument gives a ""so-so"" hand gesture, which is actually a good answer to the question. Keep watching during the rolling credits for a little hint at the next film in the series. Keep watching until the VERY end of all of the credits for a funny PSA announcement from Captain America. I love that Marvel includes those funny clips at the end of their movies. By the way, the entire movie is filled with funny PSA announcements by Captain America. Love him. I love the movie Ferris Bueller's Day Off so I got a kick out of the scene when Peter Parker is running through a bunch of people's yards and then you actually see that movie clip playing on someone's TV inside their house. ha ha I like that there are times when Spider-man doesn't have any buildings to swing around on to travel. What's a superhero to do? Instead, he has to run! Ha ha Tons of Easter Eggs for true comic book fans. Jacob Batalan makes for a great best friend and provides some great interaction and dialogue for Peter Parker. Cameo by Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts.<br/><br/>Things I didn't like: The movie starts with a shaky cam technique which made me immediately worry that this was how the entire movie was going to be. Thankfully, it only lasts a couple of minutes and exists to show you that Peter Park is just an awkward teenager who keeps a video diary and is eager to learn everything and prove himself. A lot of Spider-man's powers come from Tony Stark's high tech suit that was gifted to Peter Parker, and not his actual ""spidey sense."" Don't get me wrong, the new suit is awesome. What's up with Aunt May's high-waisted pants? Is that back in fashion now? Are they trying to make the hot actress, Marisa Tomei, look frumpy or something? There is a LOT of Audi product placement in this movie.<br/><br/>Tips for parents: Some profanity. Lots of violence and destruction. Ned tells a teacher he's looking at porn. It's supposed to be funny. It's not. The writers couldn't think of anything clever for him to say? The movie takes its time to develop characters, so little kids might actually get bored. <br/><br/>@trinaboice"
"nunonegro","8","16","27","9 July 2017"," good balance between jokes, superhero acting and fighting scenes
","Let me just start this review by saying that I'm not a ""spidey"" or someone that follows the comic books of spiderman. Actually, I haven't even saw some of the previous spiderman movies, and therefore please consider this in my review.<br/><br/>I must say, after watching wonder women and being a bit disappointed by the story, this movie comes as a very nice one.<br/><br/>I think this movie is extremely well balanced between jokes, action, plot, characters, sad moments, and overall an enjoyable movie. Sometimes, during the movie, I thought that the inexperience of spiderman came as exaggerated, but then I remember that is perfectly believable that a 15 year old boy with some powers and a super costume would act such way. Therefore, even the childish jokes are well fitted."

","Being a teenager is hard. So's making a good movie about that existence, and this is thankfully the exception. If you have superpowers, and you think you could escape your awkward, meandering high school(which this one is actually about, only took 6 tries... and 1 for the MCU) life, yet can't seem to make it, it's all the more difficult. Peter Parker(Holland, awed, spot-on) is struggling to balance it all. When The Vulture(Keaton, psychopathic and sometimes charming, complex, one of the franchise's great villains), a gun-runner, starts moving product made up of alien tech left over by fights involving The Avengers, our lead knows he has to stop him.<br/><br/>Spider-Man has finally gotten justice on the big screen. In a solo piece, I mean ‚Äì his Civil War scenes nailed it, as well. You'd think there'd be no way we could get into another adventure with the wall-crawler. 5 times in 12 years?! How to even make it distinct? For one thing, we're spared the origin everyone already knows. ""With great power comes great responsibility"" isn't said, it's communicated non-verbally, as it remains a major theme. The logically limited(how could you swing if there's nothing tall around?) powers are now enhanced by gadgets, without it becoming an Iron Man film. Tony(Downey Jr., witty, and funny in his discomfort with the role of mentor) doesn't take over. The trailers show most of the bits he's in, and he doesn't fight alongside the webhead. Humor is a focus, without it feeling desperate. The cast are likable, other than, of course, Flash, re-imagined as a rich kid. While Liz(Harrier, sweet, smart, driven) is no Gwen, she definitely isn't a Mary Jane either, and, hey, not every major female character needs to be that active in saving the day. Too Disney, Nickelodeon, excessive collateral damage(especially considering that Stark takes most of it in stride, despite what happened between him and Steve)? Some will think so, and I can see why.<br/><br/>I recommend this to everyone. Yes, you read that right. If you can enjoy any movie, give this one a chance. 8/10"

","I'm no Spider-Man comic book expert, but based on what we've seen so far, this is a great fresh reboot for Mr. Spidy. Without posting any spoilers, if you saw the last Spider-Man film, the introduction gives multiple nods to both the previous Spider-Man film as well as give the audience a full introductory into the MCU, in a very strong way. A lot of people get nit-picky with their preferences on which movie does better. I prefer to take these kinds of films at face value rather than become the critic. I liked the movie, the direction it took made me feel like it was something the fans have been waiting for. Spider-Man is actually on the short list of my top five super heroes list, number one being Batman. There were a number of Easter eggs that I caught. Michael Keaton nailed his role as the slightly grouchy old dad and business man. It's almost like he's arched back into the favorite character of Batman, again, in a good way. The instructional videos w Captain America were hilarious by the way,....."
"muhammedelgammal_","8","16","27","7 July 2017"," Great flow but a weak ending
","Going into this movie, it was difficult to set an expectation for what was about to come considering that this was now the third Spider-Man series that Marvel has released. In the previous series, Tobey Maguire was a great Peter Parker, but he was a terrible Spider-Man; on the contrary, Andrew Garfield was a terrible Peter Parker, but he was an awesome Spider-Man. Now Marvel has introduce us to Tom Holland. He seemed to be a good balance of the two- Peter Parker and Spider-Man.<br/><br/>The story was incredible. It had a smooth flow to it. It showed a great back story to Vulture, played by Michael Keaton. Although it was short, it took us back to the setting of the aftermath of the first Avengers movie battle in New York. It tied up loose ends quickly, and it brought us up to speed years later to the present day.<br/><br/>Vulture was a threatening predator. His suit was crazy, but it was a bit too big. It would have been nicer to see more of Vulture during the daylight. Most of his appearance was at night, so the details of his suit were not as glamorous as it could have been.<br/><br/>Shocker was subtle, but intense. He had a small role, but his presence was good to see.<br/><br/>I was disappointed that there was no back story to Peter Parker becoming Spider-Man. Yes his back story is known by many, but it is essential to set the tone of this new series of Spider-Man. I also did not care for the ending. It is mainly because of the fight between Spider-Man and Vulture. It was too short, and it could have been much better.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed this installment of Spider-Man. It had a lot of humor all throughout the story. Tom Holland did an exceptional job as both Peter Parker and Spider-Man."

"nferatu","8","34","65","4 July 2017"," Great Spidey, bad writing. Forced diversity
","My take on Spider-Man Homecoming. To me it seems like Sony and Marvel were in a battle. Sony execs were trying to make a terribly written movie to match Spider-Man 3 and Amaz Spidey 2, but Marvel tried to blunt their blows with making Tom Holland an awesome Spider-Man. For me, starting around the ferry scene (which just turned ridiculously stupid) the ""small world"" plot devices and ridiculous name dropping was stupid and insulting. The over the top forced diversity is annoying. Why was Liz black? OMG, a beautiful actress and good job...but why not just create a character for her to be?! Flash was so off point it made my skin crawl. ""Michelle""...I want to kick Sony in the teeth. Holland saves the movie...but, even though this will be a blockbuster...the seeds of Sony's inept handling of the franchise are already planted. It's so easy to predict that Sony will ruin this franchise in 1 or 2 more movies, completely. I give it a B...because Tom Holland was great. Ned was good...but was he a new character or a bastardized Ned Leeds? So sick of Sony and Fox."

It's high- tech Spiderman joking around never really feeling like he was put to a real challenge. At times it felt like I was watching a prolonged video-game cutscene due to the huge amount of CGI. Also some of the casting felt very misplaced. (ex Flash & May).<br/><br/>Maybe I'm just tired of seeing another new Spiderman. Tobey Maguire and Spiderman 1-2 is still the best so far.<br/><br/>Love the look of the suit though."
"subxerogravity","9","21","38","7 July 2017"," Tom Holland is the best Spider-Man, Yet!
","The same way Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight was a realistic approach to Batman, Homecoming gives us the most realistic idea of what a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man should be, and it was not a dark image, just a real one. He made mistakes while proving his worth and it was not all about epic battles and high dramatics. A lot of the action felt so down to Earth while still being very impressive.<br/><br/>You don't have to be a fan of the Marvel Cinematic universe to love this movie, but it does make it cooler as they put a lot of subtle references in this in order to integrate Spider-Man into the fold.<br/><br/>At the same time, the focus on Spider-man is all the movie needs. Tom Holland was the perfect choice for this teenage superhero. I just loved his Web-Swinger the most. He was awesome.<br/><br/>Also love that even though this is a revamp of The Spider-Man franchise, which comes like three years after the Amazing Spider-Man, that they did not revamp the villains. Like Batman, Spider-Man is well known for his large collection of colorful villains, but unlike Batman, who feels the need to revamp the Joker each time he starts a new set of films, Spider-Man keeps going forward, never using his greatest foe (Green Goblin if you don't know) as a formulated crutch. We may have revamped Spider-Man far too many times already, but at least we are seeing all his best enemies on the big screen.<br/><br/>Speaking of, here comes the vulture, played by My Batman, Michael Keaton, wow! He's Batman, then He's Birdman and now he's The Vulture. I would think this would be the type of moves that would kill an actor's career, but you'll think differently once you see him portray a man who just went overboard providing for his family, especially in those scenes when he's doing those ""I want to justify my villainy to the hero""scenes.<br/><br/>Not the best special effects that I've seen in one of these movies, but other than that, I loved it. Not the best Spider-Man movie made (still Spider-Man 2), but it's definitely third on my list (after Spider-Man(2002) http://cinemagardens.com"

","A great, fun movie. Exciting to see Spiderman incorporated with the MCU and the Avengers. I agree with the '10' reviews... and also most of the '1' reviews. As a youth in the 90s I grew up with the Animated Series that became so popular. I am also a fan of the original comic from decades ago. Yes, I agree that this telling deviated much from some of the classic attributes to those early fans loved and criticized in this movie. Some of the changes made me cringe but just for a second. Most were well integrated. This was a great ""retelling"". Times have changed from the 50s, 60s, and even the 90s. I.e., Parker uses his smartphone instead of his flash camera from the original. The characters are more diverse - what's wrong with that (not just for PC reasons, but this takes place in NYC, right?). Stark is more involved in Parker's life. Etc. This movie tied in several elements from across years and versions of Spiderman's canon. I'm glad this wasn't another origin story. We still see a young upcoming hero, struggling with his powers, but also get to see the Stark involvement even though it happens later in the comics it brings Parker into the established time-line of the Avengers universe. Parker proves himself independently but still has a relationship with Stark. Aunt May's a bit younger but it works fine. His uncle is unmentioned but this more about Parker's relationship with Stark and Avengers world than his own personal backstory (we can still enjoy the old movies for all that). The villain, Vulture, was fantastic. Keaton was great. His story as a salvager of the all the alien wreckage from the Avengers' battles ties in nicely (again, this is part of the MCU). Anyway, I almost wanted him to win. He looked cool and still vulturish. I do feel Stark was a little too controlling but that's the character and Parker learns how to stand up to him. I only reason I took a point from 10 is the seeming lack of spider- sense. And MJ not a redhead. Some character updates withstanding, her red-hair is part of her. The Captain America cameos were a nice touch. And Hannibal Buress."
"zterrell","1","18","32","11 July 2017"," Fooled by previews
","Suckered me in on this one. Preview made it look like Iron Man had taken Spidy under his wing -- mentor and trainee sort of action. Turns out this is material written about a teen searching for puberty and had only a cameo or two of Avengers. Then there's Hollywood dishing out PC-ism to the 10th level. Peter is the token white character, with no white friends at all. That isn't any more disconcerting than being preached to or brainwashed -- often subtle, but at other times flagrantly -- by the writers of this tripe. If this is where the Avengers are going, I'm no longer looking forward to their two-part ending ... just to it ending."
"carly_hope","8","16","28","8 July 2017"," Not an origin movie but a story of growth
","What this movie could have done with less of is Tony Stark. It served mostly to remind me why I find him incredibly irritable and annoying. He hijacked the growing Peter had done in the story mostly to cover the fact he screwed up. Because Peter mostly needed attention and a little nudge in the right direction. Not someone to tear him down. But most of the great things Peter had done happened because he is a genuinely good person and often happened despite Tony not thanks to him. Though that last scene with Happy and Pepper was fun.<br/><br/>Tom played the young man who was promised greatness and then was left hanging and who was trying to find his place in the world - both regular and superhero one, with a lot of heart and a lot of charm. Especially the whole part since he found out Volture's identity and the subsequent fight. He was also sufficiently snarky and funny. And I love how they managed to capture the fact he is just a teenager, eager and over-enthusiastic at times, with lot of growing to do but definitely on the right track.<br/><br/>His schoolmates were also well portrayed, I especially enjoyed Flash, Ned and Zendaya was simply splendid as MJ. They laid a very nice groundwork for a potential relationship as well as flashing her out as her own character.<br/><br/>The villain of the story was interesting as well. Someone who stepped to the wrong side of law out of necessity, something that is not that hard to identify with. It makes him sympathetic even if you do ultimately want him to lose.<br/><br/>Marisa as aunt May was interesting as well. There were moments were she felt kinda out of place and in others their moments with Peter were beyond lovely. <br/><br/>Also, kudos for the representation race-wise. It was refreshing. <br/><br/>Overall, it was a fun movie, it tied nicely to Civil War, introduced the characters and made me eager for more."
"ohthatguyproductions","8","16","28","7 July 2017"," Main cast is great. Supporting cast holding it back.
","Pros: Tom Holland hits a home run. He's just as good as he is in Civil War but with more range. I liked the connections this movie has to the MCU. The comedy was mostly fantastic with few misses. Tom Holland's banter is just what you'd expect if you know Spider-man. Michael Keaton was a good pick for the Vulture which was a decent lesser Spidey villain to start a new series with. I loved how the story explored different situations and difficulties Spider-man might face. Toomes and Parker have a particularly great moment together. RDJ pretty much IS Stark at this point and he's exactly what you'd expect of him. There are some really fun cameos too.<br/><br/>Cons: I thought that Ned was annoying and could have possibly not even been in the film. Aunt May was weirdly sexualized with the story taking unnecessary moments to affirm how attractive she is. I honestly expected a little more hand to hand with Spidey and Vulture. Maybe Flash Thompson is what his kind of character might be like in today's high school but he was....not what I'm used to. I was also not a fan of Zendaya's character. She had a some good moments but her character is not someone I personally would enjoy being around. This wouldn't all be so bad except for what she does towards the end of the movie. It was like at the end of The Dark Knight Rises when JGL says his name is Robin. I didn't understand the whole Shocker situation. He did nothing to improve the movie and I could've done without him even being in it. Lastly, some big trailers moments were left on the cutting room floor which I have always hated.<br/><br/>Overall: Although it seems like I have more pros than cons, I enjoyed the movie. The main characters are fantastic and a breath of fresh air since the Amazing Spiderman series was so terrible. Many of the supporting characters were either obnoxious or didn't need to be there. They are the weakest part of this film IMO. Excellent movie and a good start towards reviving the franchise."

","Spider-Man has always been among my favorite comic book superheroes--until this movie. True, I read the comics and watched the cartoons long ago, so some things might have changed about the source material. But as far as I know, even in Peter's teen years, he never had a boss telling him which crime to fight and which to leave to the ""adults"" and he never needed one. Then Disney's Marvel went and gave him a boss and they made it Tony Snark (misspelling intended). My Spider-Man is an independent, basically self-sufficient, brilliant, caring underdog whose wisecracks made me laugh, even when I was reading them from dialogue bubbles. This Spider-Man, this whiny impostor, has a jerk for a mentor, another jerk for a ""supervisor"", an artificially intelligent suit that was made FOR him (complete with training wheels) and--for almost the entire movie--the sole purpose of impressing Snark enough to get a seat at the Avengers' grown-up table.<br/><br/>People praise this movie for providing a so-called more accurate depiction of an adolescent Peter and his troubles. But what troubles? A crush on a girl? Haven't other movies done teenage woes, discomfort and humiliation a thousand times better? I'm pretty sure even Raimi's first Spider-Man movie did a better job of that! I'm not going to waste any more of my time on this counterfeit Spider-Man."

","Spider-Man: Homecoming is the best Spider-Man movie since 2004. It nails the characterization of Peter Parker and adds a fun John Hughes feel around him. It's a very refreshing experience to finally see Peter Parker as an actual high school student who looks like he's in high school, and not a 28 year old Andrew Garfield. Tom Holland does an amazing job embodying Peter Parker and Spider-Man. Where Tobey Maguire has the best Peter Parker and Andrew Garfield has the best Spider-Man, Tom Holland successfully balances both sides of the character. The opening 30 minutes are fun and exciting, you get to see a montage of Peter just being a friendly neighborhood Spider-man that is hilarious, and shows a really likable character in Peter. This film shows how naive Peter really is. He has tremendous power, but he hasn't honed control over that power. That inherently forms a very well executed Mentor and Student relationship with Tony Stark. Tony Stark is used great in the film by not being too there too little and not being there too much. He's kept a good distance away from Peter so that he's not hovering over him the entire movie. Happy also serves as a hilarious side character to Peter, especially in the beginning. The tone perfectly nails Peter in high school, while the tone is amusing there is still moment of serious consequence for Peter, and he has to answer to Tony for some of them. Although the feel of the high school is spot on the only aspect that didn't as well as it needed to was the love interest. It never seemed to fully click between Peter and Liz. Micheal Keaton as Vulture was a good but not great villain. Some of his motivations seem slightly contradictory, but he's a good character with an interesting connection to Peter, and the Vulture Suit is a heavy slashing piece of sharp metal that look dangerous as hell. The films biggest fault was the overuse of CGI for Spidey's suit. It's a great suit but the film heavily relies on the CGI for moments that don't need it, and it takes you out of the movie as a result. Overall, Spider-Man: Homecoming has a fun atmosphere around it with a good characters surrounding Peter Parker. So I give it an 8.0"
"xlmusicpro","3","8","12","1 January 2018"," Absolute waste of time as usual when it comes to these regurgitated Marvel titles
","For starters, this Spider ""man"" has to be one of the most annoying actors I have seen in a while. Whiny voice, uninteresting and cliche dialogue does not help the case. Secondly, the movie does not bring anything fresh or new (I know... shocker when talking about marvel). The graphics and effects were good, but all that flashiness does not save the movie and especially not spider ""man"" himself.<br/><br/>Overall, Spider man Homecoming, like most of marvels copy and paste movies, deserves a pass."
"fuzzymax-76787","8","8","12","10 November 2017"," With an excellently cast Spidey, Homecoming swings High, but not as High as other Marvel entries.
","After the relative disappointment of the Amazing Spider-Man films, Spider-Man Homecoming is a welcome breath of fresh air. It's well acted and directed, with the best version of Spider-Man to date, although it does feel like something's missing. The tone is one of the things I particularly admired in this film; I could really relax, and have a good time. The high school element element was also invigorating, and felt like a good move on the studio's part as well. The script and story are adequate, and the humour charming if leaned on a little too heavily. But the cast, well directed by John Watts is what really impressed me in Homecoming. Tom Holland is the Perfect Peter Parker, and is genuinely hilarious and lovable throughout the film. The Vulture is a great villain, with Michael Keaton making you uneasy with every word that came out of his mouth. Jacob Batalon is sparky as Ned, and RDJ is once again on fine form as Tony Stark, albeit in a smaller role in the film. A criticism I would make is that the relationship between Peter and his love interest Liz (portrayed by Laura Harrier) feels extremely strained. Something that did trouble me walking out of the cinema was that whilst the film was great, it did feel like it was missing something; perhaps it was darker elements, or even emotional scenes. Overall however, Homecoming is a success, and undoubtedly a welcome addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and an installment that will please Spider-Man fans without question."
"wyh-60464","8","8","12","2 November 2017"," Not profound, but motivating
","For several personal reasons, I have watched this film for three times. However, for each time, I could find something new. This is a film not that perfect, but is definitely worth watching.<br/><br/>Based on comics and cartoons, superhero films are not always keened on by movie critics. Some people say that they are ridiculous, some think that they lack the educational purposes, some even recognize them as some child plays. It is true that superhero movies don't have that much profound meanings, but as for some popcorn movies, they indeed make me impressed.<br/><br/>This Homecoming resonates me, partly because I am also a high school student, just like Peter Parker, and probably that is the reason why this film is not loved by many audience, since they cannot feel the real sense this film wants to express. But anyway, the story first.<br/><br/>After the civil war between the captain's team and Iron man's team, our spider-man, Peter Parker, comes home. He find himself fond of doing such missions, but it seems that he is ignored by Tony. Peter Parker is not welcomed in school, except for his USAD partners, including his best friend, Ned. One day when he is doing his daily patrol job around his home, he accidentally finds some people robbing the bank with some high technology, and after some fights, he recognizes the danger of these weapons. Spider-man's identity is found by Ned and when they are ""forced"" to attend the party organized by Liz, the girl Parker likes, Spider-man finds the clue of the weapon. He is defeated by the bad guy who invents those weapons and rescued by Iron man's armor. After a series investigation, rescuing his students trapping in the elevator caused by the piece of weapon Ned takes with, fighting on the ferry and causing many people's life in danger, spider-man's suit is confiscated by Iron man. Parker is depressed and focuses on study. When the school organizes a ball in order to celebrate homecoming, Parker finally invites Liz but then finds that her father is the bad guy he is chasing for. In the meanwhile Liz's father also finds Peter's secret, and finally they have a fight. Doubtlessly, Peter wins, and arduously, he puts his girlfriend's father into prison.<br/><br/>It is a movie with humor, toughness, growth and friendship, so like I said, it is not welcomed by all the audience. Adults feel it's naive and boring, while children only focus on the fights. From this film, however, I can see the toughness Parker overcomes, just like the real trouble in my life. The academic issues, the interpersonal troubles, the desire of chasing dreams, the hardness when making decisions and the disappointment when facing failures all innovates me, touches me a lot. For some moments, I even thought that: What? That is me!<br/><br/>However, this is still a superhero movie. The talkative spider-man is the same as depicted in the comics, which contrast with short- spoken Peter Parker. Some one hates this portrait, but I like it. Though not deeply, it shows a way in which a suit can change a person, and foreshadows the trouble Peter Parker has to deal with, which eventually reveals a beloved character. Spider-man depends on his suit but forgets who he really is and what he is capable of, and that's why Iron man needs to confiscates it. Spider- man finally overcomes his mental obsolete and can partially be called as a real superhero. This is how he growth. Instead of calling this film a action story, I'd like to call it the chasing of dreams.<br/><br/>Except for spider-man, the Iron man also gives me a different feeling. In Iron man's own films and the Avengers, Tony Stark gets rid of both his mental and physical issues, and finally proved his own value. In the Homecoming, Iron man becomes spider-man's mentor and shares his experiences, which really touches me. Unlike the hero who tries to save the world, Tony Stark in this film is only a father-like character who teaches Peter Parker the right and wrong.<br/><br/>The actors in this film are also studious. In my own perspective, Tom Holland turns from a unknown actor into some one I admire, not because of his appearance or the wonderful actions, but by the emotions he bring to me. But of course, I like everyone in this film.<br/><br/>Some one say that this film doesn't follow the comics. That's because of the missing of uncle Ben, the talk-able suit made by Iron man, and some other differences. Well, that is a long story. Since Marvel has many different editions of every story, it conclude them as "" parallel universes"", and what happens in the film is the Marvel studio- universe. Since I know little about the editions audience want to see, I have little to say. This film has some disadvantages, including the unclear motivations, lack of expression of some characters' emotions, loose connections between places and characters, but it is still a great movie.<br/><br/>I have to admit that the previous spider-man movies have great influences, and I like them as well, but they are loosely related to this Homecoming. To be fair, Spider-man: Homecoming impressed me, and this film is really worth watching."

","I cannot believe that this film gets such a high score here. I had never liked the original spider man films basically because I wasn't very fond of the cast. Now I really appreciate those after watching this. The new spider man was so annoying in this film. I could not even focus on the story line as all the time I got distracted and annoyed whenever he was talking and I wished he could keep silent."

","Just watched it, and it was simply painful.<br/><br/>I was really positive about this movie after the seemingly unending river of praise that flowed towards it. I mean even the people at Cracked liked it for crying out loud! But please don't be fooled. This movie is just boring, poorly acted and full of nonsense even for a comic book-based flick. Oh, and the writing, I guess too many cooks spoil the script (12 of them to be precise). And also even the visuals were not THAT good - it's 2017, darn it! Overall I think it's safe to say that this is not even YA movie, it's a preteen movie. Like if you are around the age of the protagonist (e.g. 15) you'll *probably* enjoy it. But even then, if you even remotely compare this to Iron Mans, or even the Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy it just falls painfully short."

","""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" was entertaining in the way popcorn flicks are, but I found it lacking in substance. As with most Marvel movies, the audience is apparently supposed to just play passive observer, willingly suspending not just disbelief but also suspending any impetus to actually think about what's happening on the screen. So sure, ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" is a nice film if you want something essentially mindless, but the writing doesn't rise above the average Marvel movie. The best part of the movie is Michael Keaton's Vulture, and honestly, even that isn't saying much.

"TheLittleSongbird","8","8","12","20 July 2017"," Spider-Man with a fresh twist
","Really enjoyed the first two films, both contained great scenes/action, acting and the two best villains of the films. Was mixed on the third film, which wasn't that bad but suffered mainly from bloat, and was not totally sold on the 'Amazing Spider-Man' films.<br/><br/>Whether 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' is the best 'Spider-Man' film ever is debatable, some may prefer the first two films, others may prefer this. To me, it is the best 'Spider-Man' film since the second and on par with the first two. It may not have taken as many risks or had sequences/action as memorable as the first two films, and for more of an origin story it's best to stick with the first two films. For a fresh twist on 'Spider-Man' and the superhero genre, 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' (one of Marvel's best to date) more than fits the bill.<br/><br/>'Spider-Man: Homecoming' is not quite the masterpiece as proclaimed to me and maybe not quite as good as the acclaim, but personally can totally see why it is loved so much and that it deserves all the positivity it's received. It has a couple of faults, Liz is a bland and underwritten character and Laura Harrier does nothing with the character. Flash also could have been much more intimidating in demeanour and physicality, for a bully one is not intimidated, pretty anaemic actually and even annoying at times.<br/><br/>Much more could have been done with Spider-Man's powers and how he got around, they could have been better used, being not used enough, and of better quality.<br/><br/>However, 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' looks great. Slick, stylish with bold, atmospheric use of colour and mostly top-notch special effects. Michael Giacchino pens yet another winner of a music score, both rousing and hypnotic with also an intensity and emotional undercurrent.<br/><br/>It's a remarkably well scripted film too. It has some hilarious and rarely forced humour (namely from Ned and Michelle, both of whom should have been annoying but were refreshing scene-stealing comic relief), poignancy and tension. The story works well as a superhero story, with great chemistry between Peter and Tony Stark and a terrific scene in a car with our hero and Vulture, and even more so as an affectionate and easy to relate to coming of age and trying-to-fit-in story. The action is kept at minimum but what there is is fun and suspenseful, even if there were sequences and climaxes more memorable in the first two films.<br/><br/>A risk was taken having Jon Watts in the director's chair, but luckily inexperience doesn't show, there is a great sense of visual style and momentum is kept taut. A great cast also helps, with Tom Holland doing a wonderful job in the complex dual role, both roles are easy to relate to and he differentiates the two personalities of nerdy, awkward high school deadline and charismatic head-line-making superhero with remarkable ease.<br/><br/>Michael Keaton, fresh from giving two of his best performances in years in 'Birdman' and 'Spotlight', is also superb as Vulture, a refreshingly different and more complex villain than most Marvel villains, a menacing villain but with a humane side with a far less generic motivation than one would find in other Marvel films and doesn't feel underused. A villain that one is intimidated by but also feel sorry for. Marissa Tomei seemed bizarre casting on paper but she is very charming actually and fits well.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jnr brings charismatic intensity and authority to Tony Stark, Jon Favreau is fun while Jacob Batalon and Zendaya are refreshing comic relief.<br/><br/>Overall, very good, often great and very nearly outstanding (which it would have been if more care was given to a few of the supporting characters). 8/10 Bethany Cox"
"Colin0001","6","38","76","6 July 2017"," It didn't feel complete
","I had high expectations for this film. Wonder Woman raised the bar, and I thought this would top that, based on the trailers alone. Little did I know that the trailers contained the best parts of the movie anyone. Therefore the movie never got better than what I'd already seen.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what to make of the pacing. The film felt slow and boring (I'm sorry, but this surprised and confused me too). It was not until later in the film that the story started to come together, and the pace picked up. Also, it felt like a Spiderman and Iron Man movie, as opposed to a purely stand-alone Spidey feature. That wasn't so bad, but I think the whole Stark Enterprises angle could have been handled very differently. Did Iron Man need to be in the film? No. Not as far as I'm concerned. Maybe the studio(s) were worried that without a big name, they might not get the crowd they were hoping for. That illustrates that they don't understand the meaning Spiderman has to Marvel fans, and to his wider fanbase.<br/><br/>Spiderman's school-friend starts off as lovely and funny, but I soon was wishing that he would die in the movie. What an irritating guy! From the trailers you learn that he sees Spidey doing his thing in his own home, and then has to keep a secret. However, he so nearly can't keep it, that he just comes across as a buffoon. In the next movie, I hope they replace him with someone else.<br/><br/>I didn't find enough in the film to engage me, and fatally, it didn't feel filmic. It felt like a TV movie. I'm not sure why, but you'll see for yourself. This film should have been more than just filler, as we wait for the Infinity Stones saga to be fully unleashed. But it ended up feeling just that....padding, while we wait for the really good stuff."
"alexanderpirkas","10","15","26","4 August 2017"," An ""amazing"" fresh view of the Web-Slinger (Spoilers)
","After already 5 previous adaptations of the Web-Slinger, anyone could think that the magic behind the character is gone. But with their newest film in the MCU, ""Marvel Studios proves that theory wrong.<br/><br/>What Director 'Jon Watts' has done here it's just ""amazing"". It's really obvious that his vision of Spiderman was heavily inspired by some John Hughes movies, like ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" and ""The Breakfast Club"". (There is even a whole scene of Spider-Man running through backyards and fences which is an exact replica from ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off""). In that way the Director focused more on Peter Parker and his life as a High School kid and used 'the' Spider-Man as a tool for the majority of the film. And the result of that decision was that 'we' the viewers could care for him & relate to his character a lot more than all the previous adaptations.<br/><br/>The Story as a whole is really grounded. There is no world-destruction, no big wormhole in the sky. The Story focuses on events that surround Peter and so we go from event to event to event with small ""arcs"" in between, this style of film making makes the movie feel a lot more fast passing than it actually is. And in fact this is the slowest Spider-Man film, it's just the way the set pieces are handled that make it look fast so you'll never get bored (Brilliant). <br/><br/>And of course no one can forget the protagonist himself ""Tom Holland"". There's not much to be said, the guy it's just perfect. He nailed the character like no other before him. It's like he was meant to become Peter Parker. Jacob Batalon as Ned, Peter's best friend was just the best. (Funniest character in the film). And Zendaya playing the loner kid 'Michelle',was definitely the most mysterious. Her character has many quick build-ups throughout the movie. Most likely building up for the sequel.<br/><br/>Marisa Tomei nailing the role of Aunt May. For once May actually acted as his Aunt not his 100 year old grandma. Robert Downey Jr. for the first time is not only shown as Tony Stark/Iron Man but also as a role model to Peter. Which suited his character, especially after the events of Civil War. Jon Favreau returning as Happy Hogan was a ""happy"" addition. Laura Harrier as Liz , Tony Revolori as Flash , Angourie Rice as Betty , Bokeem Woodbine as The Shocker and Jennifer Connelly as Karen the A.I. voice of Peter's Suit. All of them were great additions to the film.<br/><br/>But leaving the Theatre my favorite character and portrayal was Michael Keaton's The Vulture (Adrian Toomes). The is no denial that he is one of the best villains in the MCU. Every Time his character speaks or even appears on the screen, I'm sold. He's scary, intense and Intimidating. But behind the Scary character of the Vulture is the personality of Adrian Toomes. A person like peter, facing everyday problems. You understand why he's doing what he's doing, his motivations. Like most people he's a family man and he will go through anyone and anything to provide his family with everything they need. Definitely my favorite character in the whole film.<br/><br/>MCU films are often criticized for their lack of memorable soundtracks. And for the most parts its true. With the exception of The Avenger, Ant-Man and the Winter Soldier. Well, Spider-Man: Homecoming is on of these exceptions. Homecoming does not only have my new favorite theme in the whole MCU (Vulture's theme) but the best sound production in all the marvel films starting from Iron Man. Every sound 'hits' exactly the right tone, the right volume, the right moment. Best Cinema sound-experience I've had.<br/><br/>The fight/action scenes on the other hand, I wouldn't call them a flaw. But they're certainly my least favorite from the movie. Here is where Spider-Man 2 kicks in because it had some of the best action scenes in any superhero film till today. Homecoming really showed that fight/action scenes are not Jon's (director) specialty. Which is not that big of a problem in this because there aren't many action fight/action scenes in the film due to it being grounded and focusing of Peter's Life more. But if Jon Watts returns to direct the sequel he has to improve his skills on directing action.<br/><br/>Overall one of the best films in the MCU. Great Story, great acting, great sound design. With very few improvement to be done in the sequel.<br/><br/>9.8/10"

","'SPIDER-MAN: HOMECOMING': Four Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>The second reboot of the 'SPIDER-MAN' film franchise, based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. This one is co-produced by Marvel Studios (for the first time), with Sony Pictures (who previously held the film rights) distributing the movie. It's the 16th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and it integrates the Peter Parker/Spider-Man character into the Marvel film universe for the first time. The movie has Parker (now played by Tom Holland) as a 15-year- old high school student, that's trying to balance being a super hero, fighting a new villain called Vulture (played by Michael Keaton, of 'BATMAN' and 'BIRDMAN' fame), and school life (all at the same time). The movie also costars Jacob Batalon, Laura Harrier, Zendaya, Marisa Tomei, Robert Downey Jr. (as Iron Man/Tony Stark of course, once again), Jon Favreau, Tony Revolori, Bokeem Woodbine, Michael Chernus, Martin Starr and Donald Glover. It was directed by Jon Watts (who's also helmed such indie hits as 'CLOWN' and 'COP CAR') and it was written by Jonathan Goldstein, John Francis Daley, Chris McKenna, Erik Sommers, Watts and Christopher Ford (a usual writing partner of Watts). The film has received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's of course another big hit at the Box Office for Marvel Studios. Being a huge Spider-Man fan, I was severely disappointed with this movie! <br/><br/>The story begins in 2012 when a salvage company, ran by Adrian Toomes (Keaton), is ran out of business by Tony Stark (Downey Jr.), but not before Toomes, and his employees, steal some alien technology from a New York site they were working at. They then sell the technology to other criminals, and Toomes builds a suit with it that enables him to fly (and he also takes on the nickname Vulture). 8 years later Peter Parker (Holland) is recruited by Stark to help fight Captain America, and he gives him a special suit to fight criminals with. Parker is eager to become a superhero, while also trying to live a normal high school life. His first major opponent becomes Vulture.<br/><br/>I think the film is well directed, acted and even well written (to a certain extent). I also love how minimal the action scenes are, and I like how the villain isn't really that bad of a guy in it. Still I hate how much Marvel changed the source material. This is kind of a good superhero film, but it's just not a good Spider-Man movie (if they would have called it something else, that would have made it a much better film in my opinion). I also don't like how sexist the casting of this film is, all of the women are really attractive in it (including Aunt May, which is ridiculous), and all of the guys are pretty nerdy (even Flash, which is equally ridiculous). I also hate that it's yet another superhero movie that makes rich people the heroes, while the poor hard working Americans are the villains. Tony Stark should not even be in this film too, it's absurd that he's Spider-Man's mentor! So I really hate so much about this film, and I think Marvel is one of the most evil and corrupt businesses in the world, but I have to admit it's still a well made movie. Spider-Man used to be my favorite superhero though, and now Marvel has ruined him for me.<br/><br/>Watch our latest 'MOVIE TALK' movie review here: https://vimeo.com/226190246"

Add to that a great soundtrack, great humor, some decent action despite some cheesy CGI, and you've got one of the best Spiderman movies in recent memory. I suggest you don't see it in 3d since it's quite blurry and is very dizzy. The sound mixing is great. Make sure you stay throughout the end for two credits scenes."

","Plot; Peter Parker struggles to balance his responsibilities as a high school honors student and those of¬†his alter ego Spider-Man.<br/><br/>Much has been made of the fact that we're on our third live-action incarnation of Spider-Man in the 21st century, and some may (understandably)¬†wonder what could a second reboot possibly¬†have to offer. The answer is plenty.<br/><br/>The approach here is far different than that of Raimi's trilogy and Webb's duology. For one, this is not an origin story. And yet it is. We don't see the spider bite Peter yada yada yada, but we do see him taking his first steps--or maybe more accurately swings--as Spider-Man.¬†He makes mistakes. Lots of them.¬†His youthful exuberance is only matched by his complete lack of experience. Despite this being the third go 'round, we need to see this part of his journey, and it handles it far better than the previous incarnations. The other important distinction between Homecoming and the other two live-action entries is that there's a much stronger focus on Peter Parker, high school student. In fact, take away the suit and the super powers and it plays a lot like an 80s John Hughes film (by design according to the director). That provides not only a fresh perspective, but also the film's beating heart.<br/><br/>The performances are all strong, particularly Tom Holland as Peter/Spider-Man and Michael Keaton as the Adrian Toomes/Vulture. Holland absolutely makes the character his own, taking a much different approach than Tobey Maguire's earnest portrayal and Andrew Garfield's uber-sensitive stuttery routine. I felt Keaton's villain was a tad undercooked for the first half of the film, but when the focus shifts he looms large, and Keaton is spot-on. I also need to mention Iron Man, if only because he's thankfully not in it nearly as much as we were lead to believe in the marketing. His role here is perfect, and as usual RDJ kills it.<br/><br/>I suppose it's natural to ask where this ranks among the Spider-Man films, and that's not an easy answer. Homecoming has the advantage of being new and fresh, but I'm not going to easily dismiss Raimi's first two outings; particularly part two, which many put on the Mount Rushmore of comic book movies (for very good reason). What I will say is that Homecoming is everything I could have wanted from a Spider-Man movie."

I mean after watching Andrew Garfield & Toby McGuire, this seems like a kid trying to play in the big league.<br/><br/>Marvel has a habit of making everything look childish but spiderman the homecoming, they have reached the pinnacle of ruining a decent movie.<br/><br/>Time, memories & money wasted."
"mistoppi","4","14","24","8 July 2017"," Wow they made the same movie, again?
","One of my biggest issues with these Marvel movies is the fact that if I want to keep up I have to watch every single thing they produce because everyone has cameos and every movie is connected to another. There are no stand-alone films anymore, and that can suck, if you're not into every superhero. I don't care for Captain America, so I haven't seen Civil War, where this new Spider-man, played by Tom Holland, made his first appearance. However, this film quickly recaps the important bits of Civil War, and by important bits I mean what Spider-Man did. Still there's a lot of stuff you need to remember from other Marvel movies. <br/><br/>What's interesting in this new version is that there doesn't seem to be origin story the way Spider-Man and The Amazing Spider-Man had origin stories. You could ask where the hell Peter Parker came from, but hey, I think we all know the thing with the radioactive spider and Uncle Ben getting shot, so we can safely assume that's still the case here. <br/><br/>And of course there's an issue with Peter Parker as Spider-Man: aren't we all bored to death? What about Miles Morales, or any other Spider-Man? What about Gwen as Spider-Girl? <br/><br/>The Amazing Spider-Man also took place in high school, but this time it actually feels like high school. Sure, Tom Holland is actually 21, but he's closer to a teenager than Andrew Garfield was, considering how fresh-faced Holland looks.<br/><br/>Tom Holland is great as Peter Parker, as great as Garfield was, and definitely better than Tobey Maguire (though that we can all blame on bad writing). Spider-Man: Homecoming has amazing young actors, such as Jacob Batalon, Tony Revolori and Zendaya. But one of the biggest reasons I wanted to see this movie was Michael Keaton. He is great as a superhero (Batman) and as a villain (Vulture) and everything in-between. <br/><br/>But apart from the fresh cast and new technology from the Avengers movies, Spider-Man: Homecoming isn't anything special. It's fun to watch, but not actually funny, apart from the typical Avengers humour. Plots in these are pretty much the same thing over and over, but then again, was anyone expecting anything else? Marvel is becoming a one trick pony. <br/><br/>So if you love superheroes, then of course go see it, but if you want something new from Marvel, then this movie isn't for you I mean third version of Spider-Man? They have so many superheroes and they go with Spider-Man, again?"

","Let me proloque by saying I am a fan of the Spider Man graphic novels. I know the stories and the characters pretty well, so my review will come from the side of the comic reader...value that however you like.<br/><br/>Now...
1st! The reason for most superheroes wearing masks is to remain unknown!! How many people know Peter Parker is Spider Man by the end of this one? 6! Tony, Aunt May, Happy, Pepper, the Vulture, and his best friend Ned! Pay attention people!<br/><br/>2nd! Do not misconstrue what I am saying here...but I get we are trying to cram as much diversity as possible into films, and im fine with that...EXCEPT HERE. Who thought it was a good idea to make big bad bully Flash Thompson a freakin 5'6"" skinny kid of Guatemalen descent who makes grade school level jokes about Peters name? His best friend is a Hawaiian of Filipino descent, and ""MJ"" is AA. I get it, young and diverse. <br/><br/>3rd! Has ANYONE who was even close to this film production ever seen Aunt May in a Spider Man book?! Old, innocent, gray haired. But i guess the studio thought, lets attract more youth by making her younger and sexier...WRONG!<br/><br/>4th! Michelle?! Who tf is Michelle?! And they have the nerve to call her ""MJ"" at the end?! MJ=Mary Jane, and she doesnt even have red hair?! What is going on here people?! WRONG!<br/><br/>5th! One of his main super powers is Spidey sense...why couldnt he spidey sense a huge mechanical arm in a fist coming at the back of his head? WRONG!<br/><br/>6th! Why did it seem like all he was trying to do the whole movie was suck up to Tony...and then when given the opportunity, he was like nah!<br/><br/>7th! Peter Parker is supposed to be a genius. Super smart. So smart in fact...that he had no idea how to use his own suit?! If he's a genius, you would think he could have figured it out pretty quick! But fine...you got the laugh out of it.<br/><br/>The reason it doesn't get a 1 star from me is because I like Tom as Spider Man AND Peter Parker. And if a movie can get a laugh out of me, then all the better. Otherwise, throw it in the 'Missed' pile."

"hoochiemoochie","6","9","14","9 July 2017"," sigh....
","I cannot believe I am saying this, but of the six Spider-Man feature films this was definitely my least favorite. It's not the worst made of the six but it is the least memorable. It's not that I was bored, but when I walked out of the theater I was really underwhelmed and couldn't think of a single scene (save one) that really stood out to me. RDJr, Keaton, and Tomei were underused, the final battle was waaay too dark and extremely anti-climactic, a lot of the CGI was poor for 2017, the love interest was undeveloped, etc. I have little reason to watch it again unless it's for an MCU marathon.<br/><br/>The worst part about this is that I was really looking forward to this movie, I'm a fan of Spider-Man and Michael Keaton, and I think Holland is good in the role. Hopefully the next one will be ""amazing""."
"mounirrmaged","4","9","14","9 July 2017"," Marvel did it again! (They made an overly hyped generic movie
","Now before you raise your torches against me, just hear me out. First of all, I do enjoyed this movie. It's highly entertaining but has tremendous flaws. It's not the masterpiece that fans and critics claim it to be, as this is a very clich√©d, predictable movie that lacks heart and substance.<br/><br/>OK so what's good about the film? Well, surprisingly the humor works most of the time. It's by far the funniest MCU movie, and that's saying a lot considering I really hate the style of humor within the MCU. In this movie, humor comes from character interactions and situations, unlike in previous films that relied on cringe worthy one-liners. Though, some of the humor do make me cringe. And is the problem. They rely way too much on humor as a gimmick to sell this movie. <br/><br/>The characters are disappointing. They are so weak and one dimensional. Some of the characters feel disposable, and aren't needed in the film, like Ned, who is just there to crack jokes and gives over the top reactions, Flash is just a generic character, and Liz Allen almost has no identity of her own and has zero chemistry with Peter. There is no reason to care about them. Speaking of Liz, the twist is actually pretty good, and raises some stakes for Peter and his relationships with Liz and her dad. <br/><br/>But the supporting characters are a waste. Which is a shame, considering in the comics, the supporting characters had an impact on Peter Parker both as a person and as a superhero from an emotional perspective. Here, they barely do anything, and they don't even have any chemistry aside from the quips they throw. <br/><br/>Michael Keaton kills it as the vulture. He is menacing, empathetic and feels the most human out of all the generic, poorly written MCU villains.<br/><br/>Tony Stark felt wasted in the film. He's just there to provide a character arc for Peter. Now he is not the center of the film as the trailer showed us, but it barely touches upon their relationships aside from Tony trying to forbid Peter being a hero.<br/><br/>Now the action sequences, I actually found them boring, and had little investment in them, only the last fight with the vulture was pretty cool, but don't expect epic action scenes like the train sequence from Spider-Man 2 or the Goblin impalement in the first Spider-Man movie.<br/><br/>Overall the movie is serviceable, but its not the best Spider-Man movie. It's fun and entertaining, but lacks heart and substance. In fact, this feels like a pilot rather than an actual movie. It's just another mediocre marvel movie. It's on par with the first amazing spider-man movie. Not exactly a good movie. Just vastly over hyped because its part of the MCU"
"somethingodd","10","13","22","22 July 2017"," Amazing and Better Than Spider-Man 2
","This movie is amazing and it is most definitely better than the first two spider-man movies made by Sam Raimi, yeah those movies were good but this movie is better, the jokes are great the story is great the characters are great, the villain was good, the action scenes are epic, the story is great , the Jokes are funny and the final fight was great and sorry did I mention the story was amazing? it is definitely my favorite movie of this year, unless Star Wars is amazing and the movie overall is very underrated, you guys might ask why and my answer is that people seem to prefer the first two Spider-Man movies, but for me those movies were good movies but the jokes aren't funny, the second movie's story felt like a Peter Parker movie instead and it should've been less than an hour cause it felt like it was trying to stretch it out but those are just small nitpick of mine and for me the first movie's origin story wasn't very accurate, as a person who read the comics the origin story was more accurate on the first Amazing Spider-Man film, sorry went side track there, so if you like Spider-Man or just Marvel in general go watch this movie"

"brianaburton","6","13","22","8 July 2017"," An Embarrassment
","This film lacks any sort of dimension to the characters what so ever, Peter Parker was so dull and the film completely missed the idea of Spider-man. After watching this movie it almost completely ruined the Spider-man franchise for me. <br/><br/>The political undertones are thrown at you within the first second of the film and continue annoying throughout the entire movie. The race changes of the characters are obviously only done simply so Marvel doesn't appear as ""white supremacists"". Michelle or MJ in the movie was annoying and hard to like, although she would have been fine as an angsty opinionated teen, once she was revealed to be MJ it was completely embarrassing, whoever decided that was a good idea should be imprisoned, seriously.<br/><br/>The acting was okay but nothing amazing. Jacob Battalion who played as Ned was unhumorous and the character was unnecessary in the film. The acting by Laura Harrier (Liz) was extremely awkward and almost cringe worthy to watch, it is obvious that she is an amateur actor. Zendaya as an actor did a decent job portraying her role, but the character, in my opinion, was just so so unlikeable and whoever wrote her script and character probably has never seen MJ portrayed in a movie before. Tom Holland could have been a good actor but the script didn't do him justice, the lame jokes and trying to make him seem like a comic nerd was a horrible idea, Peter Parker was supposed to be a nerd in the sense of mathematics, and sciences but the film completely ruined that.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie was boring and predictable, not to mention that the film didn't even show the origins of Spider-man or how he got his powers. Vulture or whatever was a sorry excuse for Green Goblin. The entire psychological aspect with the story has been completely removed, no Uncle Ben, nothing, at least in ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" they had those critical scenes. I don't even have enough time to talk about how horrible and unnecessary Iron-Man was in this film.<br/><br/>Oh and the Spidey suit in this movie was stupid, he isn't Ironman, he's Spider-man, he shouldn't have had all those gadgets and computer AI technology.<br/><br/>As a movie in general it's forgettable. Nothing is unique about this film and it feels like another copy and pasted comic superhero movie. I feel like I've already seen this movie 10 times.<br/><br/>In conclusion, if you are a die-hard Spider-man fan, more specifically, a die-hard fan of the original Spider-man trilogy, then please do not watch this film because you will be disappointed.<br/><br/>Rating Overall as a film: 6.2/10<br/><br/>Rating as a Spider-man film: 3/10"
"cmsiil","10","12","20","4 December 2017"," Needs One Thing
","It was recently brought to my attention that Nat Wolf, most known for his time in the Naked Brothers Band, was on the short list for the role of Peter Parker. Once I was informed of this I realized that while this film is already a cinematic masterpiece it is missing one thing... music from the Naked Brothers Band. While it may seem unfit for this movie hear me out, it is quite simple to incorporate their songs into the soundtrack. For example since Peter Parker is a high school student he of course spends a large portion of the film at school. The Naked Brothers Band's song ""I Don't Wanna Go to School"" would be very suitable background music for any of those scenes in that setting, because really what high school wants to go to school?"

"Eric_Cubed","1","11","18","29 October 2017"," Awful, horrible, totally detestable, a betrayal in every sense of the word.
","For evidence of myth to our cultural identity and sanity, look no further than movies, and perhaps more poignantly, comic books, most obvious in the gold and silver ages. <br/><br/>Joseph Cambell: ""On this immediate level of life and structure, myths offer life models. But the models have to be appropriate to the time in which you are living, and our time has changed so fast that what was proper fifty years ago is not proper today.¬†The virtues of the past are the vices of today. And many of what were thought to be the vices of the past are the necessities of today. The moral order has to catch up with the moral necessities of actual life in time, here and now.¬†And that is what we are not doing. The old-time religion belongs to another age, another people, another set of human values, another universe. By going back you throw yourself out of sync with history. Our kids lose their faith in the religions that were taught to them, and they go inside."" <br/><br/>Spider-Man is completely unique. He has trouble paying his rent. He is unpopular and can't get the girl, his aunt nags him, he has to work to get through school, he's bullied, an orphan, an outcast, and despite his super powers, struggles with the same everyday life issues as everyone else, an ""everyman,"" flawed, enduring grief and loss, going through identity crisis, full of fear and insecurity, his expressiveness released the moment the suit is donned (the opposite of the god-like, omnipotent ""hero""), reveals our all too human failure and vulnerability (and hence resulting in escapism), for even with his accidental powers, he could not save or protect his loved ones, and living in the real world of Hell's Kitchen and New York City only makes him all the more real. Due to the common problems we all experience, we can all relate to the fantasy of escaping into super human grandiosity wishes (the rock star, the astronaut, the Indiana Jones adventurer), for Heroes with personal problems allows us to suspend disbelief, supercharged by awe, due our connection and attunement with the struggles of the hero. Stan Lee realized, most genuinely, if someone is just pretending to be a regular person but is secretly really a superhero, then the implication is this: ""they aren't really like you and me at all."" Superman PRETENDS to be nerdy and unsure of himself, but he's not really. So all those kids who are really nerdy and unsure of themselves fail to relate to him, because the message is ""he's not REALLY like you, it's just a trick."" But Peter Parker isn't pretending to be a normal guy and a nerd, he really IS those things. So the implication is, perhaps there's a hero deep down inside of you as well, because that superhero Spider-Man looks cool in his costume and everyone thinks he's so confident, but inside he's just like you and me.<br/><br/>And now we have Homecoming, an unforgivably polished, fully funded betrayal; the acting, screenplay, cinematography and special effects though superb, effectively exterminate the true voice of the actual character, one who despite all odds rises above his terminable uniqueness to become a heroic community leader, like MLK. As much as I felt unease at the overly simplistic and childish Tobey McGuire portrayal, at least Sam Raimi and the rest refused to bow down to corporate producers and stay true to the myth, unlike this sordid piece of overproduced trash. And as for the cutely portrayed John Favreau and Robert Downey Jr., do you two have any integrity? Do you not have enough money yet? I guess not, for money is more important to you than creating a movie millions upon millions of adolescents could have grasped onto, relate to, and find some meaning in, you two absolute failures as creative artists. <br/><br/>And as for the vulture, in the comics was a diseased, repugnant utterly sorrowful being, without family or friends, who replaced the disillusionment of the working class failure/hero with a megalomania cal charlatan dressed in the pale, paltry robes of the true revengeful vulture, one who preys upon the carcasses of resentment, ugly beyond recognition, abandoned by all he had left, his meaningless job, is unforgivably counterfeited here, replaced by a numbly glib and smugly empty, boringly hollow Michael Keaton (whom I suspect did a by the numbers performance by the chains imposed by his enabling handlers). It makes me sick to my soul as we regale and worship this antithesis, pounding one more nail into the coffin lid on the myth of spider man. This sickening piece of trash is a fraud, a lie, made all the more detestable and despicable by the gate-keeping, flaccid meaninglessness of the creative killing producers. Boycott this film with every fiber of your being. Boycott it I say! Boycott it in defiance of the mythology it discounts, discredits and invalidates. Boycott it I say! Boycott for nothing else than another manifestation of the soulless, numbers crunching, vapid surface level symptom it is. Boycott it because you know you love the real and true Spider-man, the one who tried to rescue Mary Jane but failed, the one whose resentment resulted in the death of Uncle Ben, the one who gave you hope that you too, in all your nerdy, pockmarked abandon, could get the girl and be cool despite all the odds. Thanks."

"randy_orton_fan","Null","23","44","7 July 2017"," Below Average
","This is easily the worst Spider-man movie. Everyone's praising it, calling it ""Spider-man done right."" But no, it's not Spider-man done right. If anything, it goes out of it's way to do Spider-man wrong. From Tony making his suit, to Spider-man never throwing a punch, to Spider-man needing to check in with Happy to make sure he's doing what Stark wants him to, to Liz to Flash, to Betty Brant, to Ned. To him not having a Spider-Sense. I don't want to hear ""Spider-man 3 was worse!!"" Because let's be real, after 10 years of people trashing it, I've never gotten more out of anyone than ""dancing Peter Parker"" and ""not enough Venom."" And Amazing Spider-man 2 might have had issues, but it still got more right about Spider-man than this movie. The acting was better too.<br/><br/>Tom Holland was good as Spider-man. Don't get me wrong. I liked him. I liked Andrew Garfield too. But Holland, like Garfield, just left me really missing the days when Tobey Maguire was in the suit. Speaking of the suit, it looked like bad cosplay. The black parts looked like electric tape, and the spider on the back looked like it was made of felt and was hot-glued to the back. <br/><br/>The fight against Vulture was just bad. Vulture pretty much beat himself by destroying his own wings. Which raises another point. The entire movie made Spider-man look completely incompetent. From destroying private property over and over again while chasing Vulture's goons, to causing that deli to get destroyed. The best shot from the trailers, where he's holding the ship together was all to give Tony some more screen time and have him save the day after incompetent Peter screwed everything up. Which is the second time Peter had to be saved by Tony, after he incompetently got easily bested by Vulture in the sky and nearly drowned himself with a parachute built into his suit. That's another thing, why was there a parachute in his suit? In the comics, Peter Parker made mistakes. He wasn't perfect. That's one of the reasons he was such a great character, because he made mistakes and worked to make it right. You didn't get that in this movie. It was incompetent Peter screws up, someone else fixes it, or their wings blow themselves up.<br/><br/>Speaking of the Vulture. He is easily the best villain the MCU has given us so far. He had more going for him as a character than the rest of the 1-dimensional trash of the MCU (even Loki with his Daddy issues being his sole motivation). Vulture was an average joe working man who employed a lot of guys. The government screwed them over and pretty much took their way of earning a living away. So with tech they managed to hold onto, they build stuff to steal more and more, selling high-tech weapons to criminals for a hefty profit. And Vulture did it all to provide for his family.<br/><br/>The ending was stupid. Of course Zandaya was MJ. I told people who were pushing that the junior novelization revealed her as Toomes' daughter that junior novelizations have a history of altering things to prevent big moments from being spoiled. But Zandaya's character was so unlikeable the entire movie, that I was just angry when she called herself MJ. So it's not even Mary Jane Watson, it's Michelle whatever her last name is. Then Tony praising Peter and reminding him how incompetent he was just irked me. Like the guy who built Ultron has any room to talk about screwing up. The Iron Spider suit made me mad, because it's just another way to ram Tony Stark down our throats in some way. And Pepper's back? In Civil War they implied they had broken up, now they're back together? Well, that's the MCU for you, just do things in between movies. No one will bother to care, right? It's Marvel Studios and Kevin Feige, and they know no one will ask questions. Especially the critics.<br/><br/>Everyone busted out laughing when Aunt May caught Peter in the Spider-suit. Her getting cut off before saying the f-word was so stupid, but everyone around me thought it was so funny. Listening to a grown man giggling in front of me about ""Oh my God!! They almost said the f-word in a Marvel Cinematic Universe Movie!! This studio just continues to break new ground"" just really made me realize just how bad this franchise actually is. <br/><br/>The post-credit scenes were pointless. Just teasing other villains, and then spitting in the face of people stupid enough to sit through all of the credits.<br/><br/>They kept pushing that this was a ""John Hughes style movie"". But it wasn't. If this was anything like a John Hughes movie, I'd say it was closer to National Lampoon's Class Reunion than Breakfast Club or Pretty in Pink.<br/><br/>And let's talk about the stupid title of the movie. Spider-man: Homecoming. Stupid name for a movie. Everyone praised it because ""It represents Spider-man coming home to where he belongs at Marvel!!"" But let's be real. The final act of the movie is Peter going to his HOMECOMING DANCE.That's what the title represents.<br/><br/>Of course the movie has a high ranking on Rotten Tomatoes. But if you listen to the critics or read what they wrote, they all regurgitate the same talking points. ""it's fun, it's funny, it's like a John Hughes movie!"" Which is why more and more people accuse critics of being paid off. They sound like they're reading from a prepared statement or something, all saying the same things in the same way. It's ridiculous."

The one element that Spider-Man is known to deliver better than any other super-hero. Homecoming constantly throws away dramatic moments for the sake of comedy. Many of Spider-man's abilities are erased (or at least overshadowed) by Tony Starks Spider-Iron-Man suit. There was no mention of Uncle Ben, great responsibility, or Peter's Spider-Senses. Essentially all the things that make Spider-Man Spider-Man. Spidey was even afraid of heights, and chose to drive a car rather than web-slinging.<br/><br/>Considering how much fans celebrated returning Spider-Man to his roots, it's shocking how much this film changed from traditional Spidey mythology. Many supporting characters don't resemble their inspirations in any way, shape, or form. Peter and his best friend border between mildly funny and very annoying, and feel like a cross between the two buddies in SuperBad and Spritle and Chim Chim. Speaking of whom this film actually delivers a tone similar to the failed Speed Racer film, which I actually enjoyed much more than this.<br/><br/>Finally, the action and fight-scenes really under-deliver. Spidey and friends never feel like they're in any sort of danger or true struggle. And Tony Stark replacing Uncle Ben as Pete's mentor is just really off-putting.<br/><br/>Marvel has a formula that delivers successful movies, but it's just not worth sitting through 2 hours of fart-joke type humor to advance the MCU a couple inches all the while killing the heart of Spider- Man."

","This movie is about a character that has nothing to do with the spiderman we know from earlier movies, cartoons, or comic books. This movie is about an irresponsible high school kid that pretends to be a spriderman. There are other characters that pretend to be Mary Jane, Flash. So if you care about these characters at all, I recommend you to avoid this movie.<br/><br/>It should be also mentioned that the target audience of this movie is younger than 12 year old. You may ask: ""aren't all superhero movies targeting younger audience?"" Well, it is true to some degree, but this movie felt particularly childish. Way more than any other superhero movie I have seen.<br/><br/>My recommendation: If you want to watch a spiderman movie, watch one of the many that has been released before this one."

","Homecoming brings Spider-Man into the Marvel Universe to hang out with Iron Man and the Avengers and while it succeeds in being fun and action-packed it lacks in any kind of drama or consequence which came before in the previous standalone movies.<br/><br/>Tom Holland plays Peter Parker with a childhood enthusiasm and high energy which makes for fun times but his character never gets serious or really feels like he is ever in any true danger.<br/><br/>Michael Keaton plays the villain and without him I think this rendition would be in some serious trouble because the side characters are all very weak here and don't have much to do beside be funny.<br/><br/>Marissa Tomei is completely miscasts as Parker's Aunt May and just another point of humor for hot-jokes while Ironman (Robert Downey) pops in and out and there are some nice cameos here to keep the tongue and cheek going but his involvement diminishes Spider-man's journey.<br/><br/>I guess with there being so many Spiderman movies now the problem is we have seen it before in the previous movies and Uncle Ben dying in his arms and telling Peter how great his responsibility is has been done so the writers have shied away from telling a story with any real emotion or consequence but to me it's always been about Parker's relationships whether it's his aunt or his partners are crucial to the Spider-Man arc.<br/><br/>Homecoming is very light on drama, but high on action and humor and sure to please the Marvel masses who want to see him team up with the Avengers in another computer generated spectacle but as one of of my favorite Marvel characters I can't help but think they should have continued with a more grounded story with Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone at least for one more round because they had chemistry.<br/><br/>I hope it gets better and they give Spider-man more depth.<br/><br/>6/10"

","So I saw the movie last night and can honestly say I was not impressed. By no means a 1/10 movie but certainly not a 9 or 10. I am writing this mostly to ask those who castigate the 'fanboys' for wanting more from a spiderman movie what is their objective. Ironically calling these genuine reviewers 'trolls' or 'butthurts' whilst not seeing what they are themselves??? So they don't have the same opinion as you, so what? For what it's worth I agree with the fanboys, being one myself. I won't dissect too much into the finer elements of race, tech suit etc., but I do believe this move to have lost the soul of what it means to be part of the MCU. All the other films presented us with something of a slight back-story to help us engage with the current universe. I appreciate it's a Spidey story done a million times, but come on this is Spidey, we want to see him being a nerdy little guy who gets superpowers, the girl, the person we wanted to be!!! That's why we loved him. Here he is portrayed as a weak little kid, given a super-suit and weird adolescent story arc. I reckon the suit could have waited until he proved himself for the Avenger cause and there's nothing wrong with casting Gwen Stacy or Mary Jane Watson without having to diversify. Equally the bizarre Flash. So a step back for MCU, here's hoping Thor and Hulk can give us the fizz back."
"Sticksvessel","7","15","27","8 July 2017"," Solid, but flawed, reboot.
","First of all, let me get this out of the way: no. It is in no way, shape or form better than the Raimi films. However, it is not really fair to compare it to those films since this is completely different. Homecoming decides to wisely skip the origin story and give us more of a coming of age or high school flick, which is was very refreshing since one of my biggest fears was that it was going to rehash the Raimi films like the first Mark Webb film. Tom Holland is amazing as Spider-Man, as he perfectly captures how difficult it is to be both an average high school student as a superhero at the same time. Michael Keaton is fantastic as always as the Vulture, as he is very repeatable in a way that makes his different than the usual mediocre MCU villains.In fact, a lot of the supporting cast were really good in their roles. However, some big problems is that there are parts of the film where I feel like Marvel was playing it safe, as their are no real risks to action scenes. And while I was OK with most of the changes to the Spider-Man lore, there were some that felt forced or there just for the sake of change. Overall, I felt like this was a very solid start for Spider-Man in the MCU franchise. I feel that in the sequel they could expand upon the strengths of this film and make a great movie. Overall, this is a pretty solid summer popcorn blockbuster. It's no Logan or Civil War, but for a Spider-Man movie, it is just what I wanted."
"AnishMisra","8","14","25","10 July 2017"," Spider-Man: Homecoming Review
","Spider-Man Homecoming is a film directed by Jon Watts. Finally, I got to see my favorite superhero in the MCU. I was hoping for that secretly in my mind after the disastrous Amazing Spider Man 2. And yes, I was very much satisfied with this version of the Spiderman.<br/><br/>Plot: Peter Parker tries to balance out high school and his wants to be a part of the Avengers.<br/><br/>Story and direction: Going into this film I knew that nothing could be the Sam Raimi trilogy. I mean I keep that at my top favorite super hero films. But I had some expectations and it had been fulfilled to the most. But people do have to keep in mind certain things that have occurred in the previous films, because these are all connected. Many people have said this film to not show Uncle Ben and Peter being bit by a web. We have already seen that in 2 versions. If this film would have shown that too, I would have thought that ""Yeah, they just want to pass their time."" Now lets see some supporting characters. Ned was my favorite. The way he supports Peter and also adds some level of comedy was good. Michelle at times felt irritating. Tony was good for the amount of screen time he received. Pepper Potts was back which was unexpected. I liked her in the Iron Man trilogy and would like to see further where this character would go. And a special mention to Vulture/Adrian Toomes. I liked this villain. He has this personal vendetta which added something to his character. I guess this is one of the best villains MCU has given. Regarding some flaws in the film. I guess it is basically the time-line. They say the events of this film takes place 8 years after The Avengers which doesn't make sense. Because Civil war showed us the events (of Avengers) to be taking place in 2012. And Happy's statement regarding something in 2008 too contradicts the time-line. Also Shocker was not given much importance in the film. The 2nd post credit scene was basically some kind of joke about patience which I liked considering the way we wait for Post Credit scenes in MCU. The design for the costumes both the rough one that Peter wears during the second half and the one that Stark gives him was great. But I hated the costume Stark was supposed to give him in the final scene. Thank God, Peter didn't take that. The AI part in the costume was also good. That was something different I never expected. There were some scenes in the trailers that didn't make it to the final cut like: Iron Man and Spidey being together and flying, Tony saying to Peter that you don't need to worry about the ""Flying Monster Guy"" and an alternate type of entry for Vulture. I hoped these scenes would be there but unfortunately were not.<br/><br/>Acting: Tom Holland rocked in his role both as Spidey and Peter. Jacob Batalon was great as Ned. His comic timing was spot on. Zendaya was good and irritating (in terms of her character) too. Micheal Keaton was great as Adrian and Vulture. Laura harrier was also good as Liz. Tony Revolori was also good as Flash Thompson (a somewhat non-white take in the character that I liked). Finally, Team Iron Man (Downey, Favreau and Paltrow) were bad-ass in their appearances.<br/><br/>Favorite Scene: The scene where Tony asks for Peter's suit back because of the Ferry incident. I guess that added a new layer to the film because Peter had to prove himself to Stark without the suit. And as Stark rightly ""If you are nothing without the suit, you are nothing"". Meaning that it is not any suit that makes you a superhero, but the responsibility of service to people that makes you a superhero.<br/><br/>Verdict: Overall, I had a great time watching this film. Although it had some flaws but still it was an enjoyable experience. At least, better than Amazing Spiderman 2. I hope to see another great solo Spider-Man film and waiting for his appearance in the Avengers too.<br/><br/>I am going to go with an 8.5/10"
"autisticreviewers","8","14","25","10 July 2017"," Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.
","Being the 3rd reboot of one of my favourite comic book heroes, this attempt marks the first time collaboration between Sony Pictures and Marvel Studios allowing the character to be included in the MCU, what results of this is truly an entertaining, funny and yet so well made film that gives justice to the character and the extended franchise.<br/><br/>Firstly, Tom Holland's performance is truly the best, really showing what a teenage boy wants to be a hero so much, bringing charisma and joy to the role. While Michael Keaton gives us a true marvel villain that finally breaks the trend we have seen so many times, not only as a threat but we feel sympathetic towards him for his backstory. The supporting cast were all likable, and Downey Jr keeps it small not overshadowing the screen but his 'father figure' role was indeed good.<br/><br/>Direction is strong, story is simple and stays 'street-level' and even nods and references to the characters are all good, not even a feeling of overstuffing was present. I don't think there's much or little to say about the cons of the film but the way it was resulted left me happy and hopeful that Spider-Man in the MCU will indeed mark high hopes for the franchise to expand.<br/><br/>Overall, Spider-Man: Homecoming marks a true return for one of Marvel's iconic heroes, it's one we definitely needed in the MCU and shows that justice for the source material can be done perfectly, while having heart, action and fun to make this a real 'homecoming' for Spider-Man. 4/5 stars.

","Took me a while to figure out what score to give this film.<br/><br/>Because I'm such a huge fan of the character (if you know me). I'm giving ""Spiderman: Homecoming"" a ""7.9 OUT OF 10"".<br/><br/>For only 2 REASONS.<br/><br/>1: I'm not a big fan on SPIDEY having all that tech that he has in his new suit, especially when it all comes from Tony Stark himself. One of the things I love about Peter/Spidey is that all the stuff he has in his NORMAL arsenal (from the comics) is all stuff Peter built himself or at least got assisted on making it. But maybe it might grow on me as time goes by with the next movies.<br/><br/>2: (This is me personally) there's something about the pacing of the movie that's a TAD BIT weird to me. I can't quite put my finger on it.<br/><br/>Marvel definitely played it safe with this film. But besides those reasons; the movie is a great, coming of age, SPIDEY, superhero film and I can't wait to see what they'll do next with the character.<br/><br/>ONE MORE THING: I'm not going to compare this film with any other Spider-Man films because I want to treat this film for what it is on it's own. AND trust me when I say this: this is definitely a MCU styled spider-man film. So the feel of it is different from the previous SPIDEY films."

","This film was just really bad. Filled with unnecessary SJW agenda that Marvel will probably build up to full force in Black Panther and Captain Marvel. Zendaya's character is nothing, but a full throttle SJW who protests and refuses to appropriate to society. She sees herself as the oppressed one. The movie opens up with a white man correcting another white man ""actually, the correct term is Native American."" Really? Did that really offend you that much that you have to correct him because he called them Indians? They are Indians and no one is going to say Native Americans. It's two words, long, and unnecessary. What are those two jokes doing in a Spiderman movie anyways? It does not match the tone of the film at all. Disney needs to take their SJW pants off before they lose all their conservative audience. The movie is highly inappropriate based on its content. There is a joke about porn in the film. A porn joke in a PG-13 film that most 5 year olds went to see. Really Disney? This isn't ""Spiderman Gets It on With Elsa."" The joke was uncalled for. Just a few days before that dreadful Parents Explain Masturbation to Kids video too."

","The movie was good. Tom Holland is an excellent actor. The plot was good enough. Not sure why they had to make Peter Parker dumb. Not sure why they made this Spiderman the weakest Spiderman ever. Not sure why Spiderman did not have Spidey Sense. Not sure why they give Tony Stank all the credit for SPiderman. If you grew up with SPiderman in the 60's and 70's, you cringed at how pathetic this Spiderman is. This is a smear campaign against Spiderman. Maybe it's because Spiderman is still the most lucrative and loved Super Hero and maybe this story line is designed to make Iron Man more popular. It is really sad what they did to my childhood hero. Shame on them.<br/><br/>I gave it a 6 for Tom Holland being a great actor, the action and the humor. Pause for a moment of silence The ending did give a glimmer of hope, but still, Peter Parker designed his own suits and it wasn't a gift of The Stank Man. Poor reboot of the most beloved Super Hero ever, when you take into account how great Peter Parker really was and how awesome Spiderman was...before this film."
"ryanskywalker-87402","8","13","23","11 July 2017"," ""If you're nothing without the suit then you shouldn't have it""
","After an auspicious cameo in last year's Captain America: Civil War, Spider-Man now has his own standalone feature in the MCU and and I'm happy to report that it more than lives up to the promise of his previous appearance. Spider-Man: Homecoming is the third on- screen iteration of the illustrious web-slinger, as directors Sam Raimi and Marc Webb previously had separate swings at the characters, but in many ways, this seems to be the first version that truly understands what makes the character unique and indispensible in the superhero realm. If Raimi's trilogy exhibited an earnest campiness ripped straight from the comic book pages and Webb's pair of films was brooding retort to the Dark Knight series, then this film casts a lively signature of its own that's defined by soulful storytelling and perfectly pitched humor.<br/><br/>Tom Holland reprises his role as the young Peter Parker, who is desperate to become a full-time Avenger after the thrilling battle of Civil War but is told to lay low and not get into anything too perilous by his burgeoning father figure Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) Eager to help his community, he ignores the advice and crosses paths with arms dealer Adrian Toomes (Michael Keaton), who harvests the alien technology brought to Earth during The Avengers to create advanced weapons for criminals all around the city. Parker also must balance this new conflict with the everyday dilemmas of teenage life, including a best friend (Jacob Batalon) who accidentally learns of his secret identity and a new love interest (Laura Harrier) who challenges him on the academic decathlon team.<br/><br/>The film's subtitle is a nod to the fact that Spider-Man has ""come home"" to Marvel Studios after 15 years of Sony hoarding the character rights but it's actually more telling that it refers to the big homecoming dance at Parker's high school, as the movie tends to play out more like a coming-of-age teen comedy than traditional superhero epic. As opposed to the high school scenes of previous Spider- Man movies that mainly consisted of ""kids"" in their late twenties sitting around in room made to look like a lunchtime cafeteria, Midtown High School actually feels like a believable setting complete with awkward gym classes and dreadful detention sessions (there's even brief chess club shoutout, for good measure). Homecoming understands that the stakes of the story are established by Parker's interpersonal conflicts and are not just defined by the big showdown with Spider-Man's villain of the week.<br/><br/>This emotionally grounded mentality extends not just to Parker but also to Toomes as well, whose evil plan isn't to blow up the planet or take over the galaxy but rather to just stay under the radar peddling guns on the black market so that he can support his family. Keaton's portrayal of the Vulture (the Birdman jokes write themselves) is one that's steeped in desperation and circumstance rather than sinister clich√©s that have infected many a Marvel villain in the past, which makes the character one of the more compelling examples in the category. When Spider-Man and Vulture do arrive at their final confrontation, the shared history between the two comes to the forefront and creates a poignancy that makes their airborne showdown that much more thrilling.<br/><br/>It may sound like serious business but believe me when I say that there are plenty of laughs along the way with loads of quick visual gags, ping-pong dialogue and some brilliantly conceived bits that reference other segments of this Universe (there's a running joke featuring another MCUer that's delightfully unexpected). Like The Lego Batman Movie, this is a film written by people who know how to get plenty of comedic mileage from riffing on aspects of their respective characters' legacies but they do so respectfully, taking care to avoid mean- spirited jabs in the process. People are rightly skeptical of reboots, especially with franchises that have had as much recent activity as this one, but Spider-Man: Homecoming proves that a fresh vision on an existing property can sometimes have truly amazing results."
"lornemusic-1","6","22","43","7 July 2017"," It's an Avengers Movie¬Ö Not really a Spider-man stand alone.
","HOMECOMING continues the streak, no Marvel duds so far. It's a good story, with good acting and good special effects. It's good. <br/><br/>Which therein lies the problem. In an attempt to make Homecoming fit into the The Avengers Universe it forgoes a lot of what makes Spider-man great. Character depth rarely goes deeper than a puddle and instead you get cameos for the other Avengers and a story whose sole purpose is to make sure it makes sense that Spider-man has a place in the INFINITY WARS. <br/><br/>Which is sad considering Iron Man, Thor and Captain America all had great introductions to the universe with movies that worked on their own. Even the 2nd Hulk movie was great at setting up the character. The producers I guess assume we all know who Spider-man so why worry about his motivation, other than will he be in the next movie. <br/><br/>Bottom line: good movie, but not the stand-alone story Spiderman deserves. Don't believe the hype. HOMECOMING has nowhere near the character development and emotion of the 2002 or 2004 Spider-man movies. In fact, in a head to head with Wonder Women, DC has claimed its first victory resounding victory over Marvel. This is not even the best of the Spider-man franchise and is inferior to Guardians of the Galaxy. In fact, in the Marvel Universe, it ranks at the bottom. <br/><br/>Go see it, but adjust your expectations accordingly."

","First Of All , i had seen Spider-Man Homecoming movie for the first time in Randolph Theatre in Massachusetts this past Friday 07.07.2017. My name is Piotr Kucharski and i am from Europe Poland. I got into comic books at age of 10 years old and what got me into them besides growing up poor was Marvel's The Amazing Spider-Man and that is when i fell in love with the comic books in first place. I am 32 now and up to this day out of all super heroes and comic books that i am still collecting The Amazing Spider-Man and everything related to him is all my life time favorite comic book hero. Now i've had seen all past spider-man movies up to homecoming and i have to admit personally that this one with Tom Holland is as best and close authentic as it can get so far to Marvel's The Amazing Spider-Man except the fact that Iron Man Tony Stark had given him the suit and was his mentor in this latest movie. There are a lot of things that i loved in this movie such as: Tom Holland surprisingly fit and portrayed Spider-Man almost close o perfect because of his personality and great humor either though Spider-Man is American and not from England he he. Tom Holland was funny/sarcastic when he needed and serious when needed also in the movie and displayed characteristics from comic books a lot. He also fit great besides his age as high school student and as peter Parker. Michael Keaton also played fantastic vulture and almost followed him closely as Marvel comic book portraits the character. Last but not least Tony Stark was a nice surprisingly addition to spider-man as his mentor and gave him nice suit either though in comic book Spider-Man had made mostly them himself. But as future goes and compared to real life, this movie suit helped him gave the spider sense acting as a female voice in his mask which i found perfectly amazing and close as it can get to his spider-sense other than kinda movie imaginary sense in other spider-man movies. Few other things were also fantastic but some were a bit disappointing such as why they did not show Holland starting fresh a bit and getting bit by spider and becoming a spider-man?? Well they wanted to follow of what happened after civil war. In conclusion Spider-Man score 8 out of 10."

Tom Holland does make a very believable Peter Parker AKA Spider Man, playing a teenager with super powers, and shows how a teenager would react to them.<br/><br/>Takes place after the events of Civil War, So that right not another origin movie. Michael Keaton plays a good Spider Man villain, named The Vulture, you don't like what he does, but you have an understanding why he does it. Marisa Tomei does Aunt May has a loving mother figure very well, but I wish they could have written more for her. Effects are pretty descent, action scenes are okay but nothing like the original films. Robert Downey Jr has Tony Stark AKA Iron Man, plays a mentor to Peter, although he does care for Peter, but in one scene does show he becomes the mentor that Peter needs.<br/><br/>The big problems here is the love interest, who I feel never becomes a character, but just fills the void of someone for Peter to be attractive too, unlike Mary Jane Watson and Gwen Stacey there is not a believable connection. And Peters best friend the typical funny sidekick, but comes across like he's trying way to hard, that never leads to any funny.<br/><br/>Although not great, but not terrible, like I said I was never bored, and looking forward where the story goes after this."

","A quick summary of the rating: Yet another reboot of Spider-man clearly intended for younger adults (teens / pre-teens) with typical modern Hollywood touch to blackwash characters. Peter Parker's stepmom is now Mexican (?), girlfriend African and his best buddy Malaysian. How about that for a zoo? Minus 2 stars for that. The actual actor for Peter aka Spidey was at least good and likable, even better so than the previous. Still far from Tobey Maquires charisma.<br/><br/>I don't know about others but I'm personally tired of these continuous reboots that start the whole thing over and over again. The whole core plot was about some low-level ""boss"" getting his hands on some ""stolen"" sci-fi/alien stuff to do some weapon selling business. Bringing alien stuff is just silly and out of place in Spider-man universe. At least the normally excellent Keaton as the bad guy brings some missing mojo to the movie although his character development is pretty nonexistent. As a side note, the most charismatic guy in his gang faces a quick death to give room to some boring quota actor. Besides the alien stuff, bringing the Avenger's characters to the plot is equally stupid and belongs to a completely different movie (something called ""This vs That"").<br/><br/>The sub-plots were OK and quite well balanced but none of them made me feel anything. It was like watching movie scenes that I have seen before, only with crappy actors. Comedic fatso sidekick was meh, although I liked when he dropped his ""death-star"". Script overall was pretty solid but the whole movie was missing The spark that makes or breaks a movie. Sad to say but this one won't be in my movie collection."

MJ is completely different character in so many ways a bit of a diva at times and a strong independent girl who keeps to herself and has a shy side and is really lovely and kind when she takes down her barrier and you get to know her, which really does build up the plot, which is instead of putting the typical MJ And Peter Parker love Story together that is just not reality. Loved the Father And Son relationship between Peter Parker And Tony Stark really shows him as a father figure and really does connote the next few films. I would strongly recommend watching this as they have done an amazing job of getting the story right after those other failed moves and the bad guy in this movie is kind of a reference to the green goblin with the green eyes but instead with wings who perter does not know that is so interesting to watch that unfold. Spider Man in the MCU as an Avenger is about time well done Tom Holland And Zendaya and the rest of the cast and crew for doing such an amazing job as all my doubts are gone now and Spider Man is one of my favourite Super Heroes out of the MCU next to Iron Man what a call duo. Peter Parker and his friend Ned is hilarious and how he find out Peter Parker secret identity too as Spider Man is so hilarious too."

"AlsExGal","8","5","7","8 December 2018"," Probably one of my favorite Marvel films
","This Spider-Man movie is the first Spider-Man movie in the Marvel canon. The prior two Spider-Man franchises are irrelevant to this series. Spider-Man, introduced in Captain America: Civil War, is part of the final phase of the Marvel Universe leading up to Avengers: The Infinity War. Marvel wisely opted to skip the origin story of Spider-Man and instead, framed this film to be more of a coming of age tale for Peter Parker (Tom Holland) and his quest to become part of the Avengers. Tony Stark aka Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr) is tasked with taking Peter under his wing. Of course, Peter only sees the glory of being a superhero and ends up taking on situations that are too big for him to handle on his own. He has to be bailed out by Iron Man on a couple different occasions. Peter seems to think that wearing the suit with all of its gadgets and fancy technology will bring him the tools he needs to be like idols Iron Man and Captain America--not realizing that there is much more too it than just fancy tools. One very poignant moment has Peter telling Tony that he is ""nothing without the (spider-Man) suit."" To which Tony responds very bluntly, ""then you don't deserve to wear the suit."" Tony is waiting for Peter to show something emotionally and mentally that proves to Tony and the rest of the Avengers that he has what it takes to be a viable member of the team.<br/><br/>Much of the film involves Peter trying to figure out what it means to be Spider-Man. It's more than just foiling bank robberies by wrapping people up in his web. He's also trying to figure out who he is. Feeling like he's wasting his time in high school, he struggles to make friends and to fit in with his peers. He faces many of the normal issues that teenagers - especially ones that are unique- face such as bullying, crushing on a girl who seems out of his league, trying to juggle academics with outside commitments, and so on.<br/><br/>Michael Keaton portrays ""Vulture,"" the villain whom Peter encounters. Vulture is somewhat sympathetic as he seems more like someone who always gets the short end of the stick and is just trying to get a piece of the pie. But of course, he takes it too far.<br/><br/>Others in the cast involve: Marisa Tomei as Peter Parker's Aunt May; Gwyneth Paltrow appears as Pepper Potts, Tony Stark's assistant/girlfriend; Chris Evans reprises his role as Captain America appearing in educational PSA videos that Peter ends up watching during school; John Favreau reprises his role as Happy Hogan, head of security for the Avengers; and Disney star Zendaya plays one of Peter's classmates."

"bignastybastard","4","5","7","18 June 2018"," Let down by a very poor supporting cast and lazy writing
","First of all I'll start with the good points. Tom Holland as Spiderman was amazing. The guy put a new take on Spiderman and managed to be different from Toby McGuire and Andrew Garfield. He was believable as a young high school spiderman. Another good thing about the film was Michael Keaton as The Vulture. But to be fair I've never seen Keaton put in a bad performance.<br/><br/>What I don't like is that the film comes across more as High School Musical featuring Spiderman. Most of the scenes are set in Peter Parkers highschool along with his school friend. Each and everyone of Peters school friends are very poorly cast with bad actors. Flash Thomson is probably one of the worst castings in the whole of MCU. He's suppose to be the mean bullying jock but is played by an actor who would probably get blown over by Peter Parker even before he got bit by a radioactive spider. <br/><br/>Love interest was dreadful too. The only thing exiting about her was that she was vultures daughter. The hint that the depressing emo girl at the end is MJ was just really lame.<br/><br/>The film also tries too hard to be racially diverse. No racism intended but theres like 2 white kids in the school. Making Flash Thompson some scrawny little Indian kid instead of the stereotype whiteboy jock is an example of this. It annoys me how studios keep doing this with characters that we have grown up with and perceiving a certain way. If you want an Indian or a Chinese character then create the character! dont mess about with the history of already existing characters.<br/><br/>Also the writers have basically just taken Miles Morales's story, turned him white and called him Peter Parker. Seems like they just did it because they were too lazy to come up with original material.<br/><br/>Personally I still prefer both Amazing Spiderman films as opposed to this crap"

","Being quite the fan of superhero movies, I waited, like everyone else, rather impatiently for the latest reboot of Spider-Man ‚Äì this time a team effort from Sony and Marvel.<br/><br/>Sad to say, I left the cinema feeling like how Spidey's rather uninspired date (Liz, it seems her name was) felt when Peter Parker left her house party abruptly to ""put on the suit"" and kick some butt ‚Äì in other words, disappointed.<br/><br/>I was forewarned by Civil War that Tom Holland's rendition of Spidey was one talkative fella. That part proved to be true, yet that wasn't the main reason why the movie fell short of my expectations.<br/><br/>At the outset, it annoyed me with its try-hardness. We are forced to again ""feel"" Peter's excitement and put through the torture of seeing him in high-pitched, overdrive mode with the very jerky home video of his experience with The Avengers in Civil War at the beginning of the movie. Like, why. We know he was psyched by the experience already. Does the point have to hit home again? <br/><br/>Next, we have Ned Leeds ‚Äì who strangely gave us some laughs yet was rather pointless at the same time. Quite clearly, the good-natured, fumbling friend of Spidey's is but a device for the audience to know Spidey's thoughts and feelings ‚Äì never mind that the character is already talking nineteen to the dozen as he tries to justify his actions to himself, as well as his hero, Tony Stark, aka Iron Man.<br/><br/>Are the characters Ned Leeds and Happy Hogan quite necessary here? Does the suit have to be quite so high-powered? Must the movie feel so high schooly? Why does Aunt May (or rather, just May) need to be so young and ditzy? Where is the chemistry between Liz and Peter? To what extent does Tony Stark's involvement in the film help it to be better? <br/><br/>No doubt Stark's well-deserved anger and watchful eye balance out Peter's reckless enthusiasm, but that is about as far as it goes ‚Äì a budding student-mentor relationship that incubates in the back woods as the movie is filled up with a ton of redundant nonsense, including underwhelming villains and some horrifically ho-hum sets, hoping to endear itself to the audience.<br/><br/>Try as he might, not even Oscar winner Michael Keaton can disguise just how blah The Vulture is as a baddie. In fact, he seems to be as unschooled in this area as our webbed superhero. He is merely a mercenary, opportunist and Protective Dad ‚Äì with none of Green Goblin's deliciously depraved insanity or Doc Ock's well-meaning but misguided (yet strangely poignant) ambition.<br/><br/>As for the sets ‚Äì from house party, from Midtown High School, to Staten Island Ferry, to Washington Monument¬Ö all were just fugly. What happened to the gorgeously coloured palette of Sam Raimi's well-loved trilogy that showcased New York so vividly and beautifully? Not to mention the stunning shots of Spidey swinging effortlessly through the city . . . a feat never to be replicated, it seems.<br/><br/>That said, despite the too-long run time, weak storyline and uninspired sets, Tom Holland put forth an earnest portrayal of a 15-year-old youth well over his head ‚Äì who, having once been part of a superhero alliance, wants desperately to fully realise his webbed identity ‚Äì and in doing so, validate his existence and all the bad that we surmise must already have happened to him and May.<br/><br/>If Andrew Garfield's Spidey had too much of a boy-meets-girl-and-boy-just-happens-to-be-Spidey feel to it, then Holland's Spidey is one who needs to develop some clarity and calmness, much like how Jon Watts probably needs to rein it in a little ‚Äì so that we as an audience, can have a sense of the magic appeal that Spider-Man used to have.<br/><br/>To date, no movie has come close to Raimi's 2002 Spider-Man, which truly took us for one hell of a spin."

","A few years ago when I found out that the Spider-Man saga was going to be restarted again, I was like: ""Nooooooooo why? Garfield was awesome!""<br/><br/>I always loved the Spider-Man's trilogy (the ones with Tobey Maguire) since I was 4, and they're still special for me; the ones with Andrew Garfield were as amazing as the titles.<br/><br/>And then we have Tom Holland...well, when I first saw him performing Peter Parker/Spider-Man in ""Captain America: Civil War"", I was judging him all the time, because I found him like very stupid and irritating for being Spider-Man. And, of course, I first considered him as a giant insult for its predecessors.<br/><br/>But then ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" arrived and the only motive I had to go and see it was my eternal faithfulness to Marvel and its movies, but that was it. Otherwise, I wouldn't have bothered on buying a ticket for it.<br/><br/>And I was almost completely wrong.<br/><br/>I was surprised of how good and hilarious was the job of Tom Holland as Spider-Man. Although before this movie I always saw him stupid, I realized that, after all, Peter Parker was still a boy, and that's what Tom was in here, and something that the other Spider-Man movies lacked.<br/><br/>Michael Keaton was excellent as the vulture (what can I say? He always does an excellent job), and I think that everyone in the cast did a great job, even Marisa Tomei as Aunt May (despite the fact that she was a bit young for that role, but it was find).<br/><br/>The only character that I thought that was completely awful was Flash Thompson. He was a big guy who enjoys to bully everyone who is smaller than him, not a stupid and annoying geek who made look Peter as the bully. And there's other character that at first you will love, but then when she made a brief reference to a character, you will hate...you guys when you see the movie will know who am I talking about.<br/><br/>In conclusion, all the action was good, it has nice jokes and well, it is always nice to see Mr. Downey Jr. and, of course, the always important special appearance of Stan Lee.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!"

"johnclarkejohnclarke","5","9","15","28 July 2017"," Did I Miss Something?
","I must have gone to see a different film because the one I saw was nowhere near as praise worthy as the rave reviews I'm reading. It was an OK film. Nothing more. All the acting was fine with the possible exception of MK who seemed to have dialled it up to eleven in every scene for no good reason. Possibly because his motivations for being the (very weak) baddie were very thinly painted to start off with he felt the need to overact whenever the camera was on him. It felt like Marvel cut any scene a two year old might struggle with. In fact the entire plot is so laughably thin it's a wonder they stretched it to a full movie. I can't work out why it's call Homecoming either as the homecoming party plays no significant role in the film. Nor is there a sense of the character coming home. Unless they just mean it's come back to Marvel. <br/><br/>The semi re-purposing of fight scenes from CA Civil War was initially enjoyable but the video diary motif went on a little too long. The humour was funny but the rhythm of the jokes and one-liners became repetitive and some of the CGI was poor and looked animated. The climax is the usual Marvel 'big thing falls from sky' preceded by lots of nothing we haven't seen before.<br/><br/>The introduction of a computer geek sidekick for Master Parker seemed a pointless addition unless this is in the comics and has been left out by all previous movies. In which case the previous movies made the right choice. The other troublesome introduction is that of the super suit gifted by Tony Stark. It turned spider man into a more bendy Iron Man making his spidy senses more or less redundant. <br/><br/>Overall an OK film that adds nothing new to the Marvel universe and does nothing to push the collective Marvel story forward. If it was a coffee it would be a cappuccino. The absence of plot and character development leave plenty of room for froth but don't expect any substance."

","Spiderman has now been reintroduced as a film series for the third time in less than twenty years with the release of Spider-Man Homecoming. While it might be easy to dismiss this film for that reason, it's important not to given just how well this film interprets the franchise it represents. <br/><br/>Homecoming is very aware that most of its viewers have already seen a Spider-Man origin story multiple times. As a result, it smartly leaves out the bits of story you already know and focuses on the more meaningful parts of Peter Parker's character. This is truly the first of the Spider- Man films to accurately depict the Spider-Man as both a high school nerd and a friendly neighborhood super hero (complete with wisecracking puns), not necessarily dealing with Avengers issues of impending world destruction, but rather with problems of a smaller scale. In fact, showing the balance of high school drama and super hero responsibilities is an excellent depiction, such as in Peter's dedication to being a good student and him placing as much importance on attending his academic decathalon matches as saving the city.<br/><br/>The introduction of a more high tech suit was an interesting direction for Spider-Man as well. For some fans it might be seen as a poor choice considering how the basic super powers (such as Spidey Sense) are somewhat downplayed in favor of Stark technology. However, it was important when considering the story arch that was introduced by it for Peter's character. The theme of actions versus abilities is shown, highlighted by Tony Stark himself, who makes a few brief appearances in the film.<br/><br/>Speaking of Tony Stark, I was worried going into this movie about the presence of big-name stars such as Robert Downey Jr. and Michael Keaton who might possibly overshadow the up-and- coming Tom Holland (who, if you didn't know, is playing Spider-Man). However, the direction of the movie is flawless, and each of these big stars is given the minimal screen time to advance their character in the story without leaving the young Tom Holland as a supporting character in our minds. Keaton's villain is a very relatable blue-collar man who is fighting for the working man. He does his part well without overstating his welcome. And Tony Stark, well, by this point we're all familiar with Iron Man. Thankfully, the film has him as more of an Easter Egg and uses a more thoughtful method to connect him to Peter. This is done successfully through Tony Stark's assistant, Happy, now having a more prominent role as Peter's mentor (which he fills well as a form of comic relief). Other supporting cast members also perform their parts well, such as the now younger Aunt May (whose attractiveness is a running joke in the film), and Peter's best friend at school, Ned.<br/><br/>The film is the overall one of the most surprising of the MCU films released in awhile considering how different of an approach it has to Spider-Man, and super heroes in general. It's worth checking out and certainly hits home, not just as an MCU submission, but as a reintroduction to the Spider-Man franchise, and as a movie in general."

Web-slinging its way in a little past 2 hours, Spider-Man: Homecoming manages to tell an amusing tale without trying to build up a franchise. While lacking a whole lot of character back story, it manages to blend in with the Marvel cinematic universe as it goes through the ups and downs of being a superhero. The CG is a mixed bag, along with the action, but for the most part, pass fly with bright red and blue colors. Tom Holland puts on a good show. The tone of his voice and line delivery do wonders for his character. Michael Keaton and Marisa Tomei also do a nice job filling in when Tom isn't doing the heavy lifting.

","As a film on its own, this movie was OK. Decent special effects, camera work, writing, etc. As a Marvel Studio's film, with a pre-existing universe, characters, multi-million dollar budget, top name producers, etc. I cannot fathom how this is the end result movie they created. It is a far cry from what it could have been, and even more so from what Spider- Man is.<br/><br/>*Possible minor spoilers*<br/><br/>To start, changing all of the characters simply for the sake of diversity, without regard for how it may affect the quality of the film, is poor filmmaking. A movie is for entertainment. Not a platform for political agenda, and I really wish Hollywood would stop sacrificing film qualtty just so they can check all the political correctness boxes. I have no issues with a diverse film if that is what is required of the story, but in this case it is not. Mary Jane is a red head, period. It's obvious that they selected one of each race for the kids so that they could earn brownie points with the SJW crowd. Although some morons are taking it a step further and have actually complained they ""missed one"" and that there were no LGBTQ. Side note, if your one of those people, go watch power rangers...they checked all the boxes.<br/><br/>As far as the rest of the film...I think it was more the writing than it was the acting...but Tom Holland came off as annoying, whiny, and overall unconvincing as Spider-Man. I don't know about anyone else, but we've seen the high school Spider-Man thing done over and over. I want to know when we are going to see a darker, battle tested 35 year old Spider- Man. Instead Marvel keeps making them younger and even more annoying.<br/><br/>Watching this movie was like watching an uncensored Disney teen movie special. I really couldn't figure out who this film was supposed to be for. They threw in several curse words and a fairly dark villain to get the pg-13 rating. Meanwhile the majority of the story seems to revolve more around the everyday lives of nerdy teenagers than anything else. But does that sound like something you would want to watch as a grown ass man in your 30's? Of course my 11 and 13 year old liked the movie, and at the same time I question if some of the content was even appropriate for them. In one scene you have a girl mentioning she would ""f"" Thor. <br/><br/>This movie, could and should have been so much more. But instead Hollywood insists on replacing good filmmaking with political correctness and trying to capture too many audiences in a single film. Now I did have fairly low expectations for this film, but it fell short even of those."

The ideas, and THE REAL spidey that once we all knew, maybe sadly done this time for Justin Bieber or Lady gaga's generation.<br/><br/>The facts:<br/><br/>1. Where is the Spidey sense? 2.

It works as a comedy and a action movie, but it feels ""small"" it's like Ant-Man or Thor movies...were talking' about the most iconic Marvel character. Spidey deserved a much better movie! 2. All the Spider man fans know, in the depths of his heart: Spiderman 2 still be the best, and Home Coming, despite it's failures, proves it: the two remakes with Andrew Garfield are over. 3. John Watts gives good rhythm to a funny movie with harmless humor, good performances, but with a Spidey that is unable to hit someone in the face, and the heart and strength of the original character.<br/><br/>Maybe the next one will be better."
"john310","1","24","49","6 July 2017"," Confused
","I'll start from the beginning as the movie slowly starts to unravel itself.The plot is simple enough to follow and nothing out of the unexpected occurs throughout the film and no twist and turns. The younger cast is not okay... looks like a bunch of 7th or 8th graders. Only Holland is good enough but he too relies on quips and jokes with his uncle Stark who continuously provide him with gadgets and improvement because unlike his comic counterpart this spider-man is a idiot for someone to be actually known to be as ""one of the greatest scientific minds in marvel universe"". why did they shoehorn Stark into the film? The ferry scene was setting up to be good but in comes our savior of the day since our lead hero isn't enough. Also why keep on showing so much footage before the movie releases? why shoehorn stark and not give more than required screen time for the villain and his motivations? why give Parker a AI in the suit? just so that he can banter around to himself ? <br/><br/>The younger cast is something not to be touched upon. <br/><br/>Ned Leeds??? a bastardized version of our actual character, <br/><br/>Liz Allan a black-washing i might say,<br/><br/>Betty looks like a toddler, Flash Thompson... a joke of what the character is actually in the comics heck even the actor himself quoted that people may not like his portrayal and he is very different from the source material. If you don't believe me just google it for proof. <br/><br/>Only Michael Keaton and tom Holland are good in their roles but that's just it. <br/><br/>Of course i won't stretch on the cgi fight which is undoubtedly fake as much as possible but ironically are the good parts of the film. <br/><br/>Sony and Marvel has little to zero confidence in the lead character that they had to cram in all kind of big names like RDJ and Keaton to the film so that audiences might buy a ticket or two. <br/><br/>The tinkerer looks something his 21st century grandson not the actual character though.<br/><br/>Bokeem Woodbine is meh as shocker and adds nothing new to the overcrowded film as does Danny Glover's character of Aron Davis.<br/><br/>Another good casting/part about the film is Michael ""Vaas"" Mando from Far Cry 3 as Mac Gargan who i hope sincerely doesn't disappoint us in the sequel as Scorpion. <br/><br/>Instead of some independent loner character who is constantly doubting his abilities and the ""great power""that come with it the film manages to be focusing on the school drama which is irrelevant. <br/><br/>The post credit scene is good but isn't right for teasing the fate of the characters since the villains took some time to band together and pose a real threat to our wall crawler in the comics.<br/><br/>All in all a boring to passable film which will haul in loads of money for Sony and make the teenage fans go gasping for breath since it's ""awesome"""

","Growing up, Spider-Man was one of my favorite superheroes. Well, besides Superman and Batman. I watched the original Spider-Man trilogy that Sony produced. The first one was great, the second one was pretty good, but the third...I hardly remember anything from that one. It just didn't strike me as good or even average for that matter. And then Sony tried to do a reboot series. The first one was somewhat memorable, I hadn't watched the sequel, but from all of the reviews from the film I had read and heard...meh, I probably wouldn't have really cared for it. With that said, Sony made a deal with Disney (who distributes the films relating to the MCU), to feature Spider-Man in their shared universe. And with that, many fans were delighted that Spider-Man finally found his place.<br/><br/>I loved this movie. For one, let's look at Peter Parker/ Spider-Man. This time around, Spider-Man is portrayed by a young actor named Tom Holland. There are many things to like about Holland's take on the superhero. He's adorkable with how excited he gets whenever he's with Tony Stark or interacting with the other Avengers, he makes several humorous quips in the film, and he's actually pretty adorable whenever he's nervous around his crush, Liz (played by Laura Harrier). Laura herself is likable, and is actually a character in the comic books. However, unlike the comics, Liz is black in this interpretation, well, except for one huge twist that I won't give away. Admittedly, that had to have been the best moment of the film for me as it was pretty intense.<br/><br/>As for the main villain, Adrian Toones, or as many comic book readers may know as the Vulture. He was likely one of the best villains that the MCU had in a long time. My biggest gripe with the Marvel films is how they often tended to have one-note bad guys with little to no personality other than ""I'm evil."" Here, Adrian is a bit more complex: he started off as a good guy trying to make an honest living to support his family. However, life does him dirty, so the only other option was the criminal life. What I also loved about the Vulture is unlike many villains, he actually does give Spider-Man a chance to get out of his business if he knew what was good for him. Many other bad guys would definitively kill Peter then and there without question, but the Vulture has enough humanity to give Peter a chance to abandon his mission; yeah, he does try to kill him later, but it's the thought that counts. Really, Marvel is having a ballgame with their villains so far. First there was Zemo from Civil War, and then Ego from the Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 2. I just really wish that they continue to make villains with more substance in them.<br/><br/>For the supporting characters, besides Liz, there was also Ned, Peter's best friend. I thought that from the moment I saw him on screen. However, I actually ended up liking him. He has many funny lines, he's actually useful as he helps Peter track the criminals with the alien technology, and he's also pretty adorkable. Aunt May was fine, but I wished that there were more scenes between her and Peter to make their bonding more believable, but that's fine. Tony Stark himself was also pretty good; he does contribute some things to the plot most particularly giving Peter an upgrade on his suit that included several different features. It's also pretty sweet how concerned he is of Peter, as he is still an inexperienced child. And then there was Michelle Jones; I did find her funny, but she was also pretty insufferable. Also, contrary to popular belief, she is not this universe's version of Mary Jones. That had since been debunked.<br/><br/>The action scenes were great as always, and some even come off as pretty hilarious in nature. What I especially liked was how lighter this film was in comparison to most of the other Marvel films. It honestly makes one feel like a kid again watching a movie about their favorite superhero. My only gripe with the film was that several times in the film, there are some representatives of the student council who report the news; those split scenes are very cringy and unfunny. I know that it was probably deliberate on the writers' part, but I found myself being distanced by these moments. That, and one character that I didn't like was Flash, some jerk who kept bullying Peter for no real reason. He's a walking example of the stereotypical schoolyard bully that you would most likely see in a Saturday morning cartoon. I just grew to really despise this character throughout the film, that it did take some enjoyment for the film out of me.<br/><br/>Other than that, another great MCU movie that I would highly recommend."

"PeterWorthers","10","8","13","28 July 2017"," With great move comes great reviews..
","Spoiler man, spoiler man, look out folks cause there's spoilers man:<br/><br/>After so many years of trying, Spider-Man has returned to his old stomping grounds where he belongs and Marvel took right off out the gate with this one. No set up, no origin story (come on, even if you've never seen a Spider-Man movie you KNOW how he turns into Spider-Man, it's like Batman's back story, EVERYONE knows it) just right into it. Even through the marvel studio logo at the beginning we are treated to a very familiar and much missed Spider-Man theme of old.<br/><br/>Marvel was NOT playing; they pulled out the big guns and it paid off in a BIGGER way. This move had it all, but at the same time made sure you realized that Spider-Man is a kid trying to do the right thing with his powers AND live a 'normal' life at the same time. Is the new guy Maguire or Garfield? Nope, and that's not a bad thing. Holland brings a new and fresh take to the character that feels like he's still trying to find his place in this new life and we are there to watch, take his bit in Civil War times a thousand and once you see it you'll agree they got the right guy for this one.<br/><br/>The others characters fell into two categories: On the good side you have Michael Keaton, Robert Downey Jr, the (guy in the chair) and new Aunt May Marisa Tomei. The others fell into the Why are you even here and how did you get this job category: Flash (who was just annoying, period. Every time he came on screen I rolled my eyes), the 'love interest' Liz (who couldn't act her way out of Spider-Man 3) and finally Zendayas character who seemed to just 'be' there.<br/><br/>Michael Keaton was great as the Vulture, which is hard to say because he's MY Batman (not Birdman), it was nice to see that same intensity again in a superhero film from him, he's still at the top of his game. Mr. Downey Jr once again stole the scenes as Tony Stark (name me something he's NOT good in, I'll wait. No I won't, I need to finish this up) along with the help of Happy Hogan, Captain America and a few surprise guests. There are quite a few scenes where you find yourself pointing at the screen going ""hey! Its (insert person here)!""<br/><br/>A few things got to me as usual, so if you don't mind¬Ö <br/><br/>1: You're telling me Spider-man holds conversations with people Peter interacts with on a daily basis for who knows how long and they have NO CLUE he's Spider-man, yet the Vulture meets him for 2 seconds and INSTANTLY knows? <br/><br/>2: Zendaya again, she seemed to be there for comedy relief that fell way short. Her character is just there, she serves no real purpose, so once the reveal towards the end you go 'oh well, who cares'. If she had not been in the movie nothing would have changed.<br/><br/>3: If Peter is using all the schools chemicals for his webbing, in the present day and age don't you think that SOMEONE would notice all the random chemicals and various amounts that are missing and alert the authorities? <br/><br/>4: Wow, for being named 'Happy' he must be the most non happy person I've ever heard of (But you HAVE heard of me).<br/><br/>5: The addition of the various 'nicknames' for the guys in the crime syndicate (which are classic Spider-man villains) was a really nice touch.<br/><br/>6: The van chase is happening, loud scrapes, bangs, alien super weapons exploding all around and yet no one comes out to see or calls the cops? So much so that even after its all said and done Spidey can still walk through a yard and find the alien tech just sitting there, no one noticed it at all? <br/><br/>7: Donald Glover: I'm not sure what was going on with his character but I couldn't tell if he was hammered or high or both.<br/><br/>8: The language and various gestures, it fit in and seemed part of the events around it, it wasn't thrown in just to say 'We're a different kind of Spider-man'<br/><br/>9: That whole vulture costume seemed so heavy to me and you could see it was when Keaton took it off on its stand, how did using this for so long not give him severe back problems? <br/><br/>10: Final scene, one of the best scenes Marvel has come out with. It's the 'I am iron man' scene turned on its head with an updated feel. Hilarious.<br/><br/>But I digress¬Ö<br/><br/>In short, this movie 'fit'. For so long Sony has had to skirt around Spider-man mythology and the other movies in the Marvel library so that it seemed Peter was all alone in his superhero-ing efforts, now with Marvel at the reigns it's great to see Peter with the Avengers, acknowledging all the events from the previous moves like he had been there the entire time like it SHOULD BE. Its great having Spidey where he belongs...FINALLY.<br/><br/>Also, stay until after the end credits. (But you didn't need me to tell you that)"

"bob-the-movie-man","7","8","13","15 July 2017"," Not wanted: but amusing and entertaining nonetheless
","When I heard the news last year that Spider-Man was going to be rebooted yet again, I was like ""are you freaking serious""? After the successful Toby Maguire trilogy (though the less said about ""Spider- Man 3"" the better) and the mildly successful ""Amazing Spider-Man"" duo with Andrew Garfield only finishing in 2014, did we REALLY need another reboot? More dramatic spider biting? More Uncle Ben spouting then dying? The same old ‚Äì same old, rewarmed in a pan with a bit of red wine added just to stop it feeling so dry and tasteless.<br/><br/>And I still feel the same way. I understand that its more to do with rights ownership between Sony, Marvel and Disney that this got made so quickly¬Ö. but in the words of Ian Malcolm ""they didn't stop to think if they should"". <br/><br/>But actually, although I still don't really approve of it, they've done a pretty good job in rebooting in a different manner. I commented in my review for ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" that that first reboot was ""much less earnest and quirkier than the original Tobey Maguire series, and reveling more in the fun to be had around a superhero's schooldays."" This latest reboot moves even further along that scale, being very much more of a high-school comedy that a pure superhero flick. <br/><br/>Wearing the suit this time is a far more age-appropriate Tom Holland, winner of last year's BAFTA Rising Star award. And very personable he is too. The suit in question has been technoed-up by Iron Man (Robert Downey Jnr). Because here the Spider-Man story carries on from the brief cameo in ""Captain America: Civil War"" that crossed Spidey into the mainstream Marvel timeline. <br/><br/>Within the high-school setting, Peter Parker's geeky, and almost too deliberately multi-racial, gang includes his pal Ned (Jacob Batalon), very funny with a ""chair guy"" sequence, the unattainable Liz (Laura Harrier) as the love-interest, Betty (the excellent Angourie Rice who made such a great impression in ""The Nice Guys"" but didn't really move the meter for me here I'm afraid), Flash (Tony Revolori) and best of all for me the almost horizontally laconic Michelle (Zendaya, of Shoshone heritage) ‚Äì uber-cool but harbouring a secret crush on Peter.<br/><br/>Chris Evans pops up for comic relief as Captain America doing motivational high-school videos. And older viewers might want to have fun watching out for Tyne Daly: Lacey in the old cop show ""Cagney and Lacey"".<br/><br/>But stealing the show in the acting stakes is Michael Keaton as Adrian Toomes (aka ""The Vulture"") who could for all the world be auditioning for ""Birdman 2"". The well-judged thing about this villain is that he is no hyper-galactic being with superpowers, or a typical ""rule the world"" Bond villain, but just an ordinary Joe in search of financial profit to keep his family in the manner to which they are accustomed. I really liked that. The script (an army of people, but led by Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley, who also wrote the story) also nicely counterpoints the thin-line between the ""good arms dealer"" (Tony Stark) and the ""bad arms dealer"" (Toomes).<br/><br/>The script also very wisely leaps several months into where the reboot could have started. None of the tedious spider biting. No Uncle Ben ‚Äì just a sly reference to ""what Aunt May's been through"". Now this might confuse anyone not familiar with the Spider-Man story, but the percentage of people in the Western world in that segment must be less than 2%.<br/><br/>There are however also significant character changes that may annoy Spider-Man devotees. Aunt May herself is no longer the frail old lady of previous depictions, but a hot and attractive middle-aged woman (AILF?) played by Marisa Tomei (who does indeed look mighty fine).<br/><br/>Many of the action scenes are well done, with a scene at the Washington Monument being particularly exciting. It all gets rather overblown though with a later scene aboard the Avenger's plane. And this scene sums up my problem with many of these films: the superhero characters are pretty well indestructible. You know they are. So the scenes of peril, that might thrill in an Indiana Jones, an M.I. or a Bond film, lack any sort of tension. Even when the protagonist does have a superhero on the ropes, they don't carry on kicking the proverbial c**p out of them until they are ""dead""¬Ö. they lay off so the superhero can recover and kick their ass in a few minutes time!<br/><br/>The director is Jon Watts in only his third directorial outing (with only the much praised ""Cop Car"" to pretty up his CV). With such a lot on his shoulders he does a good job. <br/><br/>At 133 minutes its a tad over-long (I watched this in a double bill with ""War for the Planet of the Apes"" so my eyes afterwards were 16:9!). But it's a fun summer flick that both amuses and entertains. If you have the choice between this and Planet of the Apes though for your Saturday night at the movies, I would personally choose the latter.<br/><br/>By the way, in terms of ""monkeys"" (end credit sequences) ‚Äì yep, it's a Marvel movie, of course there are monkeys! One early on in the credits and another one at the end... which is actually very funny indeed.<br/><br/>(For the graphical version of this review, please visit bob-the-movie- man.com. Or not. Your choice! Thanks!)."

This movie was a very 'refreshing' take on my favoute comic book character. Comapred to the other two incarnations of spider-man (Tobey Magiure and Andrew Garfield) this him is, much, much light hearted and funny to the other two. The light, bright tone to this film is what makes it so great. i love the high school vibe they were going with. I loved the characters. I also love the father, son bond between Stark and Parker. Not greatest film of all time, but certainly the best I have seen in a while. So go and watch the film."
"tresm87","5","6","9","24 May 2018"," Worst Spider-Man film so far. Completely idiotic.
","Completely flabbergastingly overrated. It was essentially a teen/millennial comedy with forced pc agenda and horrendous unfunny dialogue. I mean look what they did with Mary Jane and Flash. Every time he was in his suit I was laughing at how terrible the cgi looked and Keaton was one of the least inspired villains I've ever seen and his cgi for his vulture character didn't help. Holland and this movie are mediocre in comparison to anything from the Toby/Andrew Spider-Man films. Honestly I'd take spider man 3 over this mess. Really hoping his appearance in Venom is short. Also they made the portrayal of the Shocker villain as 2 henchmen thugs with some alien technology that were around for a few min total . He was actually an awesome villain in the comics and cartoon and should've been utilized properly."

"spencergrande6","5","6","9","15 August 2017"," One-note movie about a boy wanting to be an Avenger
","It's ironic that in a culture over-saturated with superhero films, where film ""fans"" are decrying the state of the big budget pic and Hollywood studio movie-making in general, continue to overpraise these same films year after year. You can't say that superhero films are ""product"" and aren't doing anything innovative or interesting or new and then every time a new one comes out heap tons of praise on the one aspect that differentiates it from the rest - ""Wonder Woman"" is a great film because it reverses gender (but does nothing else of note) and Spider-Man is because it actually stars an actor close to the age of the character he's playing and draws comparison to John freakin Hughes because it takes places in a high school and that's what Marvel execs are touting.<br/><br/>First off, Homecoming is a pretty terrible subtitle for multiple reasons. It flat out sounds bad is the most alarming - who thought this was acceptable? And because the eponymous Homecoming in the film really doesn't serve that much dramatic purpose. The movie kind of wants you to think it does, but it doesn't and this really applies to the film as a whole.<br/><br/>Tom Holland is a fitting Peter Parker. He captures the nervousness and goofiness of callow Peter, it not exactly his science geekiness (sure he invents his webs, but that's for fanboys and does nothing for his personality like it was supposed to in the comics). For a while, this is a flick about a boy trying to find his place in the world. Navigating friends, girls, school and of course being a superhero. These parts work.<br/><br/>Then the film transitions (and fairly early on) into a one-note movie about a boy wanting to be an Avenger. Not a hero, not a boy becoming a man by learning responsibility, just an action figure with a cool suit. The film takes the entire premise of Spider-Man the hero - ""With great power comes great responsibility"" - and turns that into a dilemma about learning the powers of one's supersuit. <br/><br/>Tony's pivotal line in this movie is the most embarrassing misrepresentation of a character's identity I've yet seen in one of these kinds of films - ""If you're nothing without the suit then you're nothing."" - except of course that's not even remotely true. The suit is basically an Iron Man costume in spandex and Peter spends large chunks of time trying to figure out fancy custom web configurations. Not learning responsibility or growing up or maturing, just you know, playing with his new complex super-toy.<br/><br/>Suffice it to say that the final revelation that happens during the Homecoming scene means nothing. Peter doesn't have to do any growing in order to succeed, he just lucks into finding Vulture and then does everything he was told not to but this time around the world is saved so it's fine. And the joke they make at the end about Peter becoming an Avenger (it's a test right?) is so stupid and out of place dramatically that it just shows how completely thematically confused this whole film is.<br/><br/>Final thoughts: MJ drop mattered none - her longing look completely unearned. Keaton is great as Vulture, his motivation relevant, but grossly underutilized and developed. Action scenes are choppy for the most part. Also, is Laura a cool girl or a geek? Somehow both and yet inexplicably likes Peter for no reason whatsoever. Peter gets it all, learns nothing. Millennial Spider-Man indeed.<br/><br/>Also this film loves it some Raimi Spider-Mans (don't we all?). The upside down kiss tease. The line about Aunt May not understanding Peter's body's ""changes."" If only..."

The second hour has maybe two or three interesting moments, assuming you are OK with the idea that the father of the girl you are crushing on has sworn to kill everyone you love.<br/><br/>Overall, Marvel's TV division (SHIELD, LEGION) does better work.<br/><br/>Raimi's SPIDEY2 remains the king.<br/><br/>The simple fact that even the MSM critics missed this is disheartening."

","I love Spidey, I grew up reading his comics (I have a massive collection somewhere) hearing that Spidey was appearing in Captain America: Civil War made my year, & he was amazing, funny, cheeky & seemingly in control of his abilities & how to handle himself. The Spidey sequence in CW is one of my favourites in the MCU, beaten only by Hulk punch after he & Thor bring down the alien whale in Avengers. So in my eyes for that sequence Spidey was right on the money. <br/><br/>Now he has his own film, set after CW & he apparently has no idea what he's doing, no clue on how to fight, & doesn't seem to know or understand the limits of his abilities. What went wrong? I'm not bothered about the race thing, it's 2017 so we should see a bit of diversity in comparison to when these comics first came about & who their target audiences were so that's cool with me, however, how do you get MJ from Michelle? Is this one of the many alternate Spidey Timelines cause that's just confusing as all hell!? MJ was always Mary Jane - I don't care if she's white, black, pink, blue or a duck MJ was never Michelle. <br/><br/>Vulture, great to see him on the screen at last & Michael Keaton just stole the show in this movie as far as I was concerned. But, why did the love interest have to be his daughter? Why did he need to find out who spied was? Even if he kept it to himself there's no need. & Aunt May????? No need Marvel, NO NEED!!!<br/><br/>If the film had less Tony Stark & gadgets it may have been a better Spidey Movie.<br/><br/>There was so much pomp & circumstance about this being the first Spidey movie in the MCU, I'm afraid that I saw no difference to this movie & the countless others that've been duped out over recent years. I'd hoped it would've been like the comics, it wasn't, it was a whole new entity. & I didn't enjoy it as I believe I should've done. <br/><br/>Credit where credit's due, the actors were really good & some of the Spidey myths were dealt with in this movie, more notably how long his webbing acts for & when he's not near tall structure he can't swing around. <br/><br/>Pay to see it if you want, but i'd suggest you wait until it's available to rent, it's no where near grande enough (in my eyes) to justify the cost of a cinema ticket."

Before I go into the good stuff, I'll talk about the problems in this movie. <br/><br/>The first problem is that it kept Zendeya's identity as M.J. a secret until the end, for no reason at all. Another is Spider Man's suit looked really fake a lot of the time. Other than that, no major problems. Those problems aren't even major.<br/><br/>Vulture is the second best MCU villain so far, he has good motivations, and didn't feel forced. Tom Holland is the best Spiderman on screen, ever. Spiderman 2 was still better, but this movie has the best, most comic accurate Spiderman.<br/><br/>I like that it's low scale, and we don't have another big, world ending problem.<br/><br/>I rate this movie a 8/10, the same rating I would give Wonder Woman.

"breheneyjames","8","6","9","13 July 2017"," The best Spider-Man movie since Spider-Man 2
","Not the best Spider-Man movie but still a very good effort nonetheless. It feels very fresh and unique when compared with other MCU movies and even previous Spider-Man incarnations in that it feels like a high school movie first and a Spider-Man movie second. This movie really nails the 'day in the life of' Peter Parker type of feel that it needed to in order to take the character back to his roots which is clearly what they tried to accomplish and did accomplish for me.<br/><br/>Tom Holland is the ideal Peter Parker and Spider-Man in that he is shy, nerdy and charismatic all at the same time. I don't care much for the Stark tech version of the Spider-Man suit, however, and really feel that they made a mistake by taking the iconic Spidey-Sense away.<br/><br/>Michael Keaton is menacing and as realistic as MCU villains have come so far. He steals every scene he is in and is a great addition to the movie. It is clear with this movie that Marvel responded to the complaints about their weak villains by fleshing the Vulture out a lot more than most other MCU villains and even starting the movie out by focusing on him.<br/><br/>Although Tony Stark is not in the movie as much as the trailers would have you believe he is still in it a little too much for my liking. It really did feel like 'Spider-Man featuring Tony Stark' at times whereas I think more of a cameo with just two or three scenes would have worked better by further sharpening the focus on Peter Parker. This is not to say Tony isn't used well, however, as he basically fulfills the Uncle Ben role in this movie and it does work rather well. The supporting cast is fine and does feature a lot characters you will recognize if you are a fan of the Spider-Man comics. <br/><br/>All in all, the movie is a little uneven in that the first half is okay but the second half really does step up its game and ends on a strong note."

It shows Spider-Man as a sophomore in high school, and as he tries to do his thing, he struggles to fit in with a the Avengers, and with the kids in his school, and he is forced to decide between getting his crush and doing what's right. This is an awesome, fresh, take on Spider-Man that finally did something different then the last 5 movies to be made."

","An average Spider Man movie.Loved all the Iron Man scenes in the movie. Sam Raimi's Spider Man Trilogy is probably the best Spidey movies that'll be ever made.Characters are under-developed, story is poor. There are too many Chinese in the movie, and felt they are forcefully put in the movie for collections in China. @Marvel: When you want to make a Spider Man movie, make sure not to involve other Avengers in the movie. Tony Stark completely overshadows Tom Holland in the movie. Spider Man doesn't standout and doesn't seem like a hero. Climax fight between Spidey and Vulture was horrible. It was so bad that I didn't even realize that I was watching a climax fight. So I was expecting some great fight after the mediocre plane fight, but then the movie ended. Bullshit!!"

","**** Spoilers ****** <br/><br/>Prior to Spider man Home Coming there were 5 Spider man movies, 3 with Tobey Maguire and 2 with Andrew Garfield. <br/><br/>Although I liked the Maguire movies they were a 55 / 45 split between Peter Parker's failing relationship and Spider man story and at times the emotional failing relationship aspect of the movies became too over powering and the became main focus of the movies.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield's Spider man was more well balanced and although the movies did explore the Girl Friend /Parker / Spider man relationship struggle, it allowed the Spider man story to be a little more center stage.... and for the record had a much better story explaining how Peter Parker actually became Spider Man....<br/><br/>So when it was announced that a sixth Spider man movie my first thought was ....why? <br/><br/>I liked the fact that the film makers did not go back to the beginning to explain how Peter Parker became Spider Man because that did not need to be revisited. I liked Micheal Keaton's, Jon Favreau and Robert Downey Jr. characters... but it was down hill from there.<br/><br/>In my view Tom Holland's Spider man is the weakest version of the 3 Spider man movie versions and in parts it was very slow ... the movie did not need to be made.<br/><br/>Tom Holland's character was written like some (pre) teen movie and it was embarrassing to watch and not only that .... he spent the whole movie crying about not being listened to and wanting to be an Avenger ...but at the end of the movie he turns the offer to be part of the Avengers down..... this is just so predictable it was painful.<br/><br/>Great for kids 12 years or younger I guess..... and this would explain why the movie made such a huge amount of money in the opening weekend... The whole family going to the movie theater rather than just couples.

"jmcd2007","5","13","24","8 July 2017"," Decent film...but WAY too politically correct
","First things first, I will always regard the Maguire era as Spider- Man's ""Golden Era."" <br/><br/>With that being said, this film was indeed slightly better than any offerings from the Garfield era. Unfortunately, however, ""..Homecoming"" suffers from its use of crude sexual humor (Peter's classmates repeatedly refer to him as a male body part throughout the film) and overt use of political correctness, largely thanks to Zendaya, who is a strong supporter of far left groups like ""Black Lives Matter."" When her character announced to everyone that she had to ""get in some protesting"" and then tried to link the Washington Monument to slavery, I nearly gagged. Her instructor didn't help things at all after he followed up on her comments by saying that ""protesting is patriotic."" Spare me. <br/><br/>The writers really went overboard on the diversity of the cast too. We are suddenly led to believe that Peter Parker has an Asian friend, while The Flash is a Middle Eastern jock. Meanwhile, the Vulture is white, while his wife is black. They end up having a mixed race child whom Peter befriends and then has a crush on. Oh and everybody can't stop hitting on Aunt May too. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, Peter agrees to an internship with Tony Stark, who just so happens to be the creator of Spider-Man's suit. To make matters even more untrue to this franchise, Aunt May also discovers that Peter is Spider-Man at the end of the film too and lets out an f-bomb before the film cuts to the end credits. Really? <br/><br/>In summary, the only reason why I saw this film is because of Robert Downey, Jr. It's too bad that he didn't have more screen time, though, because he was really the best part of the film. Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Stan Lee's cameo was pretty good too. On that note, I don't have high hopes for the sequel, but will likely see it while hoping for a better and more mature storyline."

"mariantambe","5","2","2","12 March 2020"," Decent
","Homecoming is decent at best. It lacks any sort of weight for the first two thirds of the movie and skirts around Spidey thinking about anything interesting. Take the beginning of the movie, for example. Spiderman is coming home from a civil war within the Avengers team where one side fought to imprison the other and a member of Spidey's team was shot down by friendly fire. He's not thinking about any of that stuff. No, he's acting like a kid who just got home from disneyland. He's excited, shooting videos, having a little commentary about how cool it it was. That sets the tone for the movie. Major events happen and he doesn't really think about them.<br/><br/>I get this is supposed to be a light hearted film, but the lack of weight and serious confrontation combined with multiple scenes of mass destruction ( destroyed buildings, a ferry cut in half, national monument destroyed, a circus obliterated etc ) feels out of place. What's worse is that Spiderman himself seems to trigger this destruction in each case throughout the film, escalating the amount of damage done enormously beyond the amount would have been should be never interfered. A small robbery ends with buildings destroyed, tracking somebody ends with a ferry cut in half and a federal investigation ruined, etc. Yet never does Spiderman think of the damage his interference caused despite the same situation occuring over and over again. People's lives ruined because he wouldn't even think that he was out of his league, even though someone else has to save the day and clean up the situation almost every time. Spiderman is just too thoughtless.<br/><br/>Well, that's pretty much what holds this movie back but the acting and special effects are good. Tom Holland and Keaton, Spiderman and the Vulture respectively, are the best part of the movie."
"mikeburdick","9","2","2","30 December 2019"," More than a great Marvel
","I'd pretty much given up on the Spider-Man franchise, after the first two reboots, which I felt were predictable and hokey, with lame effects. Thankfully, ""Homecoming"" really delivers where the others missed the mark. This is a fun film, and feels like it fits right in with the new Avengers universe.<br/><br/>Somewhere along the way (""Ant Man"" or ""Deadpool""?) it dawned Marvel that humour was key to buttressing the somewhat shallow superhero-villain formula. And this script is full of witty dialogue and deftly timed comedic moments.<br/><br/>It also helps that Tom Holland has the perfect blend of cocky na√Øvet√© and charm to make him real and relatable. Neither Toby Maguire nor Andrew Garfield felt believable in the role, although to be fair, they didn't have a script this good and effects have come a long way. It's also good to see quality actors like Michael Keaton, Marisa Tomei and Donald Glover bringing an authenticity and complexity to roles that are normally one-dimensional.<br/><br/>The aspect of the film that impressed me the most was the storytelling. Often in Marvel films, the action and effects overwhelm the story, leaving you lost at certain points. In ""Homecoming,"" you follow everything that's happening every step of the way. Kudos to the director and editor for a well-told story with well-drawn characters and well-timed gags.<br/><br/>The best indication of the film's success may be the fact that it is a long film, but it never felt that way. I enjoyed it from beginning to end, perhaps even moreso than ""Spiderverse,"" which was wildly creative and certainly one of the most interesting Marvels. Certainly feels like they've breathed new life into the Spider-Man."

This genuinely feels like watching an 80s John Hughes film in the 2010s that also happens to action sequences in it. The scene where Peter Parker and Adrian Toomes are in the car together is brilliantly tense and shows of the dramatic range of both Tom Holland and Michael Keaton. The characters feel real and fleshed out and the breezy feel of the editing brings the world to life through the naive eyes of a young Peter Parker.

","As a long time fan of Spider-Man I found this version of the MCU Spidey a big letdown. 
Way to tech dependent, Parker's story got lost. 
Some will find it enjoyable and I'm happy for them, but as a fan who remembers the early comics, I just couldn't. I turned the movie off 51 minutes in.
That said; Tom Holland did a great job as Parker. Keaton, the little I saw of him was good. The writers and producers who approved this script should be slapped for their ignorance of the character's history and their lack of faith in the story. 
That story didn't need to be told again. Maybe recapped somehow, but not retold. It just seemed entirely out of step with Spider-Man's timeline. 
Oh well. I hope some do truly enjoy the film. It just wasn't for me."
"kphelan-47150","9","2","2","28 November 2017"," A disappointment of the MCU
","I think Spidey worked better as a side/funny character in Civil War. I don't think a funny version of Spidey can handle serious moments. Also the side characters including Ned, Michelle and Liz come in at random times and don't move the story along. One of my favorite MCU characters is Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man. He was barely in it. Also when he did come in it was at completely random places just so Spiderman did not get hurt. The Vulture was a fine villain but not great. The worst thing about this tough is the pacing. It just jumps from place to place really quickly and sometimes not enough dialogue or action. It feels rushed but at the same time too long."

This Spider-Man is set in the MCU and because of that it's going to disappoint a lot of fans, reason being were not getting the same story line as of Sam Rami's version or the comics. I loved that they chose a super young actor and that this version of Spider-Man is really irresponsible unlike Tobey Maguire's version, Spider-Man is just a kid. This is the most accurate Spider-Man to comics version that has came to a live action film. There are slight disappointments like we don't get an origin movie, an uncle Ben death scene, the classic ""With great power, comes great responsibility"" line, we don't get a Gwen Stacey (that we know of yet) and Michelle says that her friends call her M.J. was not OK. Sticking to the comic lines Peter is suppose to be with Gwen Stacy in High School and is not suppose to meet M.J. until his college life (which we could see in a Spider-Man Homecoming 3)."

Stark saving Peter (ruining the tension)... Stark making Peter's suit... bad 'love interest'... no influence character... etc.<br/><br/>But then again there was some good things... <br/><br/>Alright humour (not really my type but it should please a good few people).... good cinematography... no over-dramatic nonsense... an okay twist (only okay because it breaks up the ineffectiveness of the film and creates some well needed tension)... etc.<br/><br/>And there was a brilliant thing... <br/><br/>That being the fact that the school students actually look like teenagers (and not thirty year olds pretending to be sixteen). Because of this I have a lot of confidence that these characters - particularly the main cast - will grow out of their awkward adolescent phase and grow to be quite compelling characters. <br/><br/>The reason I can forgive this film is because my teenage years, too, were quite awkward, especially when I look back on it nowadays; and the reason why I'm hopeful for the sequels to come is because I believe these characters will grow up to be something amazing (unlike myself).<br/><br/>Honestly I'd give this film a 4 out of 10, but I no doubt love Tom Holland as both Spidy and Peter Parker."

It really has reached the limit & will do if & when the sequel gets made!<br/><br/>The character of spiderman is socially awkward & to be fair a tiny bit annoying.

Anyone & I mean, ""anyone"" could or can be spiderman, whats the point in making Iron Man like gadgets if Spiderman has powers?

It seems now films like this can't be simple & straight to the point, they have to be riddled with plot holes, bad/complex/annoying/dragged out story-line, annoying characters, politically correct characters, damn I could go on!<br/><br/>4/10 Watch the Originals of Tobey Maguire!

Even 10% more information along these lines could have added another layer of depth to the plot that would have cemented everything in place for all viewers.<br/><br/>To add to the downside, several unnecessary uses of profanity litter the movie and are yet another thing younger viewers are supposed to just endure.

","This is the reboot we've been waiting for! This returns one of Marvel Comics most beloved heroes to his roots. Tom Holland delivers a young and energetic Spiderman that teens can admire and even like, while longtime MCU fans can enjoy the web crawlers interaction with other Marvel greats. The film returns Spidey to his high school beginnings, and without rehashing the origin story movie goers have seen over and again, follows his growth as a teen superhero in a larger MCU where the world is changing following the events of other Marvel movies. One of the films stronger points is that it doesn't go over board trying to get Peter Parker grown up in 2 hours, but rather allows him to grow and change naturally. Previous adaptations of the wall crawling hero have pushed through the characters youth into early adulthood, but this movie has as much fun with it as can be had. This is an exciting ride through a new spider-verse, where audiences can delight in watching the youthful Jr. Avenger grow up through the course of many adventures, of which this is the first! The dynamic relationship between Peter and mentor Tony Stark (Iron Man) is real and demonstrates the reliance of mentors to young people. The appearance, all-be-it via video screen, of Steve Rogers (Captain America) offering his insights to high school students added a humorous, but very real feeling look into the greater MCU, while keeping America's favorite web shooter at the center of the story. This was a film well worth every minute. It is deep, dramatic and tops it all off with just the right amount of action packed heroics."

","It looks as if we now have now come to the third iteration of the Spiderman movies, which is about time since we are now bringing him into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I have to admit that this was much better than the previous iteration of the series, which I have to admit sort of died with the second film. Then again I suspect that there was a rather large push to take him out of these independent films and bring him into the Marvel Universe fold (though it appears that Sony still holds the rights to Spiderman, it is just that they are now working with Marvel, no doubt to appease the fan base).<br/><br/>Fortunately, they have decided to use a couple of new villains, which I did quite appreciate because the previous iterations had the Green Goblin and the son of the Green Goblin running around. In Homecoming we are introduced to the Vulture. The story is that after the first Avengers movie he was a contractor cleaning up New York, however the government, with the help of Tony Stark, decided to take over from the contractors leaving him with a mountain of debt. Not to be outdone, he decided that since Stark messed him over then he wouldn't play ball and decided to keep all that he had found, develop his own weapons, and the sell them on the black market. The problem is that because the materials are quite rare then he needs a constant supply, which forces him to make some rather dangerous raids.<br/><br/>This isn't the Spiderman origin story ‚Äì that has already been done to death in the previous iterations, so the movie works on assumed knowledge, that is it assumes that we already know that Spiderman has been bitten by a radioactive spider which had him gain his spider powers. It also starts after Civil War, where we were first introduced to him, and to a different, and much younger, Aunt May. As such the story is more about Spiderman's (or Peter Parker's) coming of age. The story, as you can probably tell from the title, revolves around the Homecoming dance, though since I'm not American I really can't say all at much about the tradition. However, he is still in High School, but like teenagers everywhere, wants to make his mark on the world as soon as possible.<br/><br/>The only other Avengers that makes an appearance is Tony Stark, but that has more to do with him being a mentor than anything else. In a sense Peter Parker's dream is to join the avengers, but due to his age, and his relative immaturity, they simply recommend that he be your 'friendly, neighbourhood Spiderman.' Of course, he stumbles into this game, lead by the Vulture, who are building some rather advanced weapons, and then selling them on the black market. As such the question of who should be investigating them, and putting a stop to them, comes into play. The problem is that they aren't such a huge problem that the Avengers should be involved, but Stark does not necessarily want Peter Parker going it alone. Not surprisingly he does, with the resulting consequences.<br/><br/>Basically, this is a coming of age film, and also a film that, as I mentioned, brings Spiderman into the broader Marvel Cinematic Universe. I thought it was done quite well, and it is even better that then didn't go over old ground once again (and this was necessary because they had already done this previously and it would have probably dragged the film down a lot more). I enjoyed it, though I have to admit that I didn't find it as funny as some of the other Marvel films that I had seen. In a way it felt as if they were trying to push it a little too much. Still, it is fun film, and certainly worked quite well."
"thekilon","4","9","16","7 July 2017"," The usual super boring Marvel recipe
","I have an issue with Marvel movies, which is also why I love DC movies with the exception of WW. <br/><br/>They follow this recipe of super simple stories, incredibly politically correct characters and sub standard humour. The kind of things you don't need to worry about spoiler as you see them coming miles away.<br/><br/>The peak of this for me was Civil War which I found absolutely terrible with a story that made absolutely no sense whatsoever with Tony Stark having an 180 degrees turn on his character , going from what he was to a polar opposite and all it took was 1 photo. <br/><br/>This movie follows this recipe, the story is no BVS , its super simple even a 3 year old kid could easily follow. The humour fails as usually with some notable exceptions. The characters are super flat , the dialogue lame.<br/><br/>Spiderman also suffers from Tom Holland's acting. Tom like Tobey is just not the right person to play Spiderman, but there is a huge difference, Tobey was and still is a very good actor. The reason I say this is because you cannot have an average intelligence kid , which is afraid and confused and at the same time you give him incredible superpowers and try to convince me he is also super smart. It just does not compute. Tom acting is hindered by the nonsense structure of his character but his acting is not good enough (unlike Tobey) to take this further. <br/><br/>Tom's character is ignorant, naive , not that bright which is what puts other people's lives in risk etc etc (again no spoiler, this is clearly stated in the trailer). Yet we see the same corny comeback of him becoming brave and smart in the end. <br/><br/>Essentially what I am saying is that if you are a comic book fan, or like me a huge fan of Spiderman and you were raised in the 80s go watch the movie but be prepared. Its exactly the polar opposite what Spiderman was back then. <br/><br/>Back then Spiderman was very dark (helped by the fact that the comic also was black and white) , it had minimal humour, Spiderman was a super smart super cool teenager, that was no cry baby and definitely not politically correct. The stories were incredible deep and complex and he was very strong because he has too to take down some very powerful enemies.<br/><br/>Also another issue I had in this movie is that they have really toned down Spiderman's powers. Generally speaking in the movies we see a toned down Spiderman anyway , in comics his strength is so large that he battles with ease against Hulk in many occasions. In this movie he is a lot weaker even when compared with the other Spiderman movies which make some sense (very little) in part because they had to fit in Iron Man in the movie. <br/><br/>The only reason I gave this a 4 is Michael Keaton performance as a villain though at times I pity the guy because his character is so flat and boring yet, Michael because he is such amazing actor he manages to make everything look cool and I have never been a fan of Vulture (comics), yet I really loved him. <br/><br/>Maybe there is reason behind this that Marvel studios see Spiderman as a future replacement for Iron Man, there is no such indication in the film but we all know that RDJ cannot be Iron Man forever. Probably with a more mature version of Spiderman. <br/><br/>Again the end is incredible stupid, I will give no spoilers because I don't want to ruin anyone's experience but the way Spiderman defeats (?) Vulture left me with a WTF moment not as large as Civil War but was close. You have a villain that kick Spiderman ass, again and again and in the end you have that reversal of Spiderman going from stupid to smart and Vulture from average intelligence to brain dead. <br/><br/>I am not marvel hater, I put Age of Ultron (huge fanl) up there in the top of my list together with Spiderman 2 , Iron Man 2, Guardians of the Galaxy 1 +2, Dr Strange, Amazing Spiderman 1 + 2 (especially the second one) and Ang Lee Hulk. <br/><br/>I have no doubt this will be a massive success for Marvel , if you loved Civil War you will love both this and WW because both follow the same recipe but if you did not , I doubt you will like this either.<br/><br/>I really liked also the new suit, as long as they don't make it any more Iron Man , I am fine with it. Vulture again was awesome. If Spiderman 3 was a 2/10 , this for me is 3/10 but it is boosted by Michael's and RDJ acting that so desperately needed to keep me slightly interested. I do not regret watching it, I found it enjoyable but obviously I did not love it either."

","The film was as we thought, good borderline great, but SJW's infected this film.<br/><br/>A lot of the females are simply not attractive(Outside of Marisa Tomei). Marvel seems to be pushing unattractive girls as main stars. I was very surprised no fat chicks were in the lead roles.<br/><br/>Marvel/Sony/Disney are playing identity politics. The movie lacked the hot female lead. Instead we were presented with average to below average girls, with diversity as the main focus on the cast.<br/><br/>The plot could have been more well rounded. It did lack drama and the music score did not help. There was a should out to the ""We was Kangz"" group, as they built everything and the lack of tits and ass was a feminist warriors dream.<br/><br/>But solid film. Might be the 3rd of 4th best Spidey film. It lacked the acting of Tobey and that wonderful moment with Gwen dying in ASM2."

"Michael_Elliott","Null","8","14","8 November 2017"," Highly Entertaining Action Film
","Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Another highly entertaining entry into the Marvel universe has Peter Parker (Tom Holland) trying to find a balance between his high school years and wanting to join The Avengers as Spider-Man. While all of this is going on Vulture (Michael Keaton) is creating some high tech and dangerous weapons to sell on the streets.<br/><br/>SPIDER-MAN: HOMECOMING seemed to get a lot of mixed reviews but I personally thought it was very entertaining and in fact I thought it was much better than WONDER WOMAN. What's amazing is that this is the third reboot of this series going back to the Sam Raimi films and it's really amazing that the studio keeps managing to get the perfect casts to pull the stories off. This film not only works as a very good action movie but I thought the teenage drama stuff worked quite nicely as well.<br/><br/>As I stated, the performances here really help make the film as entertaining as it is. The performance by Holland was excellent and I thought he was perfect during the scenes where the character is actually being a nerd and conflicted with various emotions. Keaton was also wonderful in his role as he perfectly played the villain. Robert Downey, Jr. could sleepwalk in his role as Tony Stark but he's always fun as is Jon Favreau in his part. Donald Glover and Bokeem Woodbine were also very good as was Laura Harrier as the love interest. Marisa Tomei looks great but she's a bit too young for her role as Aunt May. Even Jacob Batalon adds nice comic relief.<br/><br/>The action scenes are all highly exciting and it's the perfect use of CGI. I'm not a CGI fan but there's no question that it mixes in perfectly well with the rest of the footage. I'd also argue that the story itself was quite good in regards to everything going wrong in Parker's personal life and I thought the screenplay perfectly handled his emotions of trying to balance everything. Technically the film is very impressive from start to finish and there are some truly great scenes scattered throughout the picture.<br/><br/>SPIDER-MAN: HOMECOMING is certainly one of the better action pictures of recent years and it's highly recommended."

"trevor-82944","4","8","14","7 July 2017"," Catches You in a Web of Mixed Errors
","Now back in Marvel's hands, fans are finally guaranteed to love Spider- Man again. Personally, I say Tobey Maguire still has the best cinematic version, with Spider-Man: Homecoming coming out on top over the Andrew Garfield version. The one we got now gives a brand spanking new take on the famous webslinger, one maybe a little too reliant on jokes for an emotionally satisfying experience. I admit it works in delivering another really funny movie by Marvel Studios, even though the other disliked clich√©s of the franchise are still here, including his ridiculous pose in front of the American flag. What possibly went wrong here? Well¬Ö<br/><br/>Several of the plot details may shut some viewers off. A blatant ""save the cat"" scenario comes up early on, which may not sound too lame for anyone unfamiliar with what it means, until a coincidental plot twist and the most unromantic of marriage proposals dissatisfies any feel of logic. Besides Tony, nobody in the overly male cast has any personal ambition to exist other than to progress Peter's journey at the most unbelievably convenient times. So no need to include Spidey in any ""Screenwriting 101"" courses.<br/><br/>I cannot say that Stark's version of the patriot-colored costume tops all over versions; a couple of unnecessary gadgets, including a drone from his chest, drags it down too much to feel like the classic Spider- Man. His webbing also breaks too easily compared to Maguire's and Garfield's Spider-Men. While plenty of moments could have matched the intensity of Spider-Man 2's train rescue, it ultimately misses those opportunities. For instance, the ferry repair we all saw in the trailer ends too soon, aside from our hero forming a very on-the-nose crucifix pose.<br/><br/>If anything, this movie works best from all its small, brief moments that connect to the rest of the MCU. To go into greater detail, it introduces our main hero with a hilarious video diary featuring Peter's perspective of the Civil War battle. Then he attempts to contact his mentor through a long chain of unanswered texts (again, very funny). These small moments all open up chances for the adorkable wall crawler to just have some fun, especially when he has to learn his web shooter settings. The rest of the cast outside of Tom Holland also puts in their A-game: Jacob Batalon, who plays Peter's best friend, times his jokes perfectly. Even Marisa Tomei understands her role beyond just being ""hot Aunt May,"" and delivers moments when she genuinely tries to help her confused, secretive nephew. Overall, Spider-Man: Homecoming has now become the best acted, and most racially diverse, MCU movie to date.<br/><br/>Yes, like New York City itself, the cast swims in a melting pot of color. Marvel very much strives for a new, inclusive version of the American arachnid, which is great, but the extra ethnicities contribute no storytelling purpose. Make Peter's Black love interest a Jew, and the plot remains unchanged. Turn the wimpy Indian bully Flash into the blonde-haired macho man he was intended to be, and again, nothing changes.<br/><br/>In fact, I wish we got to see more of the high school setting than Peter's underused classmates. Rather than social media trends and fidget spinners, we instead watch genius kids solving problems better than the CIA. The ""Totally 80's"" themed homecoming dance itself lasts only a few moments, and when we see it, it looks exactly opposite of the 1980's. Although the homecoming setting does turn briefly hilarious by incorporating the awkward homecoming photo session under dad's careful hawk's eye.<br/><br/>Outside of the high school world, both New York and DC are key locations throughout the feature. The makeup and hairstyling job on the entire cast looks great in the different locations, but if you rewrote the script to take place in Malaysia, the story remains unaltered.<br/><br/>Although Spider-Man: Homecoming did get one thing right about New York's culture: the rebellious nature of its teenagers. Even compared to the other Avengers, no parent would want to raise a selfish kid like Peter. Like his counterpart Deadpool, Spider-Man defaces public property, steals cars, hates authority, and lies to everyone so that he can have fun fighting bad guys. He treats criminals like they deserve just to be bullied around by some kid. His mentor, Iron Man, even gives him a great moral, saying, ""If you're nothing without the suit then you should not have it,"" yet the ending contradicts his sensical message. Teens nowadays deserve better role models.<br/><br/>So therefore, I personally prefer the whimpering Tobey Maguire over the kid with the hot aunt; yet I prefer the single antagonist he fights here, however badly designed he may be, over the excessive plastering of villains pitted against Garfield. So the overall perfect version of Spider-Man may never exist, but for what we got now, it'll do."

","I am not a big fan of Spiderman movie or even comics, but I do enjoy the versions of Tobey Maguire or Andrew Garfield. As least The Spiderman is a really super nature hero, totally not like this one... just a kid with little extra super power and terribly rely on the high tech suit which is made by Tony Stark. He can barely fight back with an old bad guy...<br/><br/>Not to mention, why there are so many meaningless roles in this movie. The principal, the teacher... the girls-Michelle, Liz...a long list... Why Do Sony want to turn the Spiderman to a comedy not an impressive action movie? <br/><br/>Well, after the dark side of the movie, here I have to mention some thumb up parts. First, Tom Holland is no doubt, a talented actor, he plays this role quite nice. He does save the movie. The other part is, Michael Keaton, long time no see~ my every first Batman~ he is back to big screen~although the script didn't let him to bring his talent to full play, he still convinced me that this is still a movie worth to have a look."

","It gives me a headache this movie sucks. Spider-Man: Homecoming is the purest example of style over substance. At first, it seems like all is well, the beginning is great, but it all falls apart during the second act. All of the characters are one-note and one-dimensional. Everything is on a surface level with this movie. There's no depth to any of the characters at all. The Vulture is mad, that's it. Peter Parker / Spider- Man is dealing with his issues, but there easily solved in a mediocre way of storytelling.

Flash was a blonde football jock, Spidey had his Spider Sense to warn him of danger, this seems to have abandoned him, he had no sidekick and he was a physics major who was as intelligent and inventive as Tony Stark and Reed Richards."

All the love interests were mixed race, apparently according to Marvel the next generation of people should all be not one race but mixed with at least black, no more whites. Oh and any historical contributions by whites should be written over, based on an actual comment by a black girl about the Washington Monument being built by slaves. Yes they said that. And a classroom where all the pictures of ""great"" people were black, but where was a picture of Abraham Lincoln? Man this kind of race baiting really sours movies for me. I bet the main characters would have been black too if Hollywood didn't know white people would not go see it. I am so tired of this obvious liberal agenda filling all the media.

"matthewssilverhammer","8","7","12","13 July 2017"," Finally! A Movie Deserving of Spider-Man
","In my review for Cars 3, I called 2017 ""the year of the franchise-fix"". Spider-Man: Homecoming is more proof. Not that Marvel's universe didn't need fixing, but the webbed-wonder definitely did, with 3 straight duds under Sony Pictures. Peter Parker's homecoming to the company that made him a household name was clearly the right decision, as we're finally given a movie our friendly-neighborhood hero always deserved. Thankfully, they've foregone the unbearably overplayed origin story (bit by spider, uncle dies, blah-blah-blah) and instead swing right into the true essence of Spider-Man. The cast is a web of hilarious teachers, relatable students, and a plethora of quirky non-supers learning to live in a post-Avengers world. But Holland is (obviously) the center. Surpassing both Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield, he's the confident, funny, wide eyed, smart and awkward hero we always wanted in the red-and-blue tights. Even at age 21, Holland plays the first Peter that's believably a teenager, and the movie refreshingly leans in to that adolescence. Struggles with schoolwork, childish crushes on girls, and even naivet√© in his heroism all shine through beautifully. So yes, this is yet another positive review of an MCU film. Even if the normal issues are here (weak villain motivations, confusing timeline), it still stand among the 12(!) of 16 movies within that franchise that I unabashedly recommend. Nearly ten years since Iron Man kicked it off, it seems the further we go into this world, the deeper we explore what the implications of superheroes in the real world looks like. And as one of the premier superheroes of all-time, Spider-Man deserves that treatment, and finally gets it in this, his best film yet."
"jmarinko925","6","7","12","12 July 2017"," Good Spiderman, great cameos,wonderful villain boring Movie
","I think many can agree that Spider Man's shield stealing scene in Captain America Civil War II revitalized our hopes for a fresh take on the web slinger and had us (present company included)counting down the days to Homecomings release. <br/><br/>While Tom Hollands Spider-Man is good(inspite of him getting a beating from the most mundane thugs) and Michael Keaton's Vulture(is it okay to call him that? they never did in the movie?)is an excellent villain whose origin played out well and made sense in the movie there was just entirely to much Peter Parker and school going on. His sidekick was humorous but Spider-Man never needed nor had a sidekick and this left me hoping he never does again. <br/><br/>Better than average is fine for a character who has never had a previous on screen appearance(Ant man was a blast with no expectation)but this is Spider-Man were talking about here.<br/><br/>I understand a different direction was needed from Amazing Spider-Man 2 and Andrew Garfield's socially awkward loner Spider-Man but I enjoyed that much more and feel that was more authentic to the characters roots. Sure there are excellent cameo's from the rest of Marvel's cinematic universe but when there's no action on screen this is a bit of a snooze. I left the theatre feeling about this ,the way I did with similar films great no. Good enough to make another one absolutely! They all cant great can they? I definitely look forward to more of Marisa Tomei's Aunt May though as well as Thor Ragnorak which should be excellent."

","Saw Spider-Man: Homecoming yesterday, and it was thoroughly... OK. Didn't love it, didn't hate it -- basically because there's not much there to care about either way.<br/><br/>It has a very shallow 80s teen film feel to it, like a live action Saturday morning cartoon. So if you can unlock your inner 12 year old and not think too hard about anything, you'll probably enjoy it.<br/><br/>The culturally diverse characters are completely two dimensional - full of stereotypical personalities, and all commercially constructed to be easily digestible and likable - which pretty much sums up the movie. <br/><br/>The dialogue is very light, complete with a perky, middle-aged-plus gmilf of an Aunt May. The plot is very basic, but with at least two stellar action sequences, solid cgi and a refreshing cast of villains from Vulture and Shocker, to early glimpses of Scorpion and Prowler.<br/><br/>Not much else comes to mind. Like I said, it's a very safe, cute movie, seemingly designed to get a substantial number of laughs and avoid controversy.

"ThomasDrufke","7","7","12","10 July 2017"," Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man
","What Marvel has done with their universe to this point is unprecedented. Nobody could have imagined the MCU would become this large and this popular, nor that two major studios would collaborate with each other. With that said, there's something about it that's starting to feel a little stale. I enjoyed Spider-Man: Homecoming quite a bit, but I would have preferred it to not be as safe as it is.<br/><br/>Let's start with the positives. Tom Holland is just about as good of a Spider-Man/Peter Parker as you can ask for. For the first time, it actually feels like Peter Parker is in high school, and not a grown adult playing a high school student. I'm always going to be partial to Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man for nostalgic reasons, and I definitely love Andrew Garfield's portrayal, but Holland is undeniably great as the web slinger. As is most of the cast. Michael Keaton's return to the superhero genre shouldn't be understated. He's so dang good as Vulture to the point where if it wasn't Keaton (or a really good actor), the character would be forgettable. There's a particular scene in the car where he really shines.<br/><br/>One of the things that separates this Spider-Man from previous incarnations is the fact that he's in high school, and that particular direction they take does feel refreshing in a sense. I know some people would prefer a Spider-Man who is older and can stand alongside the other Marvel characters with age and maturity, but I think the real charm with Holland is that he's so different from the other MCU characters. Seeing his perspective pitted up against Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal of Tony Stark is something to behold. In the same breath, it was nice having a younger and more relatable Aunt May, played by Marisa Tomei, at Peter's side.<br/><br/>I think where the film starts to get frustrating is that is just feels too safe. When I go back and re-watch Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy or even both of the Garfield films, I feel like they had more of an emotional attachment and connection. I'm not saying this film needed to film yet another heartbreaking Uncle Ben death scene, but I wish I felt more of a connection to the supporting characters. I feel like because Spider-Man is now a part of the MCU, the creativity went out the door a little bit and thus giving us what is essentially the same film as Iron Man, Ant-Man, or Doctor Strange. Of course, all of these movies deal with different characters with different powers, but the approach and execution are pretty much all the same. It's not necessarily a bad thing that MCU is consistent with how they make their movies, but I would like there to be more of an individualized feel to them.<br/><br/>I love the fact that Spider-Man is as relatable as he is as a high school kid. I love that they didn't bombard us with Tony Stark and kept his role to a minimum. I love Tomei as Aunt May. I love Jacob Batalon as Ned (Perfect casting!). I love seeing the return of Happy Hogan and Pepper Potts. Heck, I even really like Michael Giacchino's score a whole lot more than I thought. But the one thing I keep coming back to with the MCU is how uninventive the last few films have been. With the exception of the Cap and Avengers films, it feels more like these films exist solely to set up the next one, instead of standing by themselves as singularly great stories. Perhaps that's just my two cents. Hopefully Marvel and Sony can build on what they've started and deliver a great sequel.<br/><br/>+Holland is perfect<br/><br/>+Good to see him back in high school<br/><br/>+Aunt May is always a great complement to Peter<br/><br/>+A lot of jokes hit<br/><br/>-But some at the wrong time<br/><br/>-Lacks uniqueness<br/><br/>7.7/10"

I wanted to see spider man (more like spider boy here) swinging from one building to another fighting vulture which never happens,we get spidey driving a stolen car to go from point A to point B for the sake of jokes.They get Peter and spidey character right, a bit of vulture right too, but they spend adding too much gadgets in the suit.still Sam Raimi's Spiderman 2 is best,followed by Spiderman 1. As for Tom Holland, He feels perfect fit for the role. I hope he finds a great sequel."

There is no such action scenese. Not much story of villain. No character development. Plot is just OK. When we see first trailer we really believed that there is gonna a big fight in end with iron man in it and tony gonna give peter his suit back but no any such thing happened. and all the spidy & vulture scenes were captured in night (no day light) so you really shouldn't expect much from this movie. Half of the movie they showed only tony stark made new spidy suit features. I guess movie should have been bit more good if there was no tony & his suit. I think in infinity war spidy will swing nicely because of russo bros. Loved his work in civil war.<br/><br/>I don't get why such company can't put emotional story line, jaw dropping action scenes, great ending etc in such big movie. and low budget & no experienced staff movies like deadpool getting created very very awesome. I can watch deadpool start to end 5 times more but can't see this crap again. Not going to even download it.<br/><br/>No idea how this movie got so many positive reviews."
"rannynm","10","25","59","30 June 2017"," Greatest Reboot Ever in Marvel Cinematic Universe
","Spider-Man Homecoming is the greatest reboot that ever happened in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This is a clever and incredibly funny film. It takes place two months after Captain America: Civil War. Spider-Man wants to become part of the Avengers, however Tony Stark thinks he isn't ready because he is a child and still needs to learn from his mistakes. Peter Parker tries to juggles being a high school kid with being a hero. Also in this film, Peter tries to stop a group of men from selling dangerous weapons to people.<br/><br/>I love this film for the characters and their banter. Tom Holland makes Spider-Man, the teenager, very lovable and relatable. I like how they show Spider-Man as a bit immature and relaxed, unlike other films where Peter is too serious and the films feel pretty dark and grim. My favorite character is Ned (Jacob Batalon) because he asks Peter so many questions about Spider- Man and that makes it really funny to watch. Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal of Iron Man mentoring Peter is quite wonderful. Iron Man helps him but he doesn't take the focus away from Spider-Man. Spider-Man's constant banter in this film is also quite amusing. This film makes certain that Spider-Man can stand on his own in another sequel.<br/><br/>There is one thing I did not like about this film and that is the storyline about his crush. It really doesn't develop and it seems that it is only there as filler. Besides that the film is great.<br/><br/>I give this film 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it to ages 8 to 18. I think adults might like this as well. This film does contain intense scenes and some inappropriate language, making it unsuitable for younger viewers. This is a ""know your kid"" movie. I recommend it to people who like action, adventure, comedy, films based on books and family movies. This is a movie worth seeing and I guarantee you will not only like this film, you will love it.<br/><br/>Reviewed by Ryan R., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic."

This Spiderman seems like 10 years old bad humour slave to the Ironman nothing without gadgets or is there something else in the movie ?

","I can only imagine people liking this movie who never knew anything about Spiderman and its characters, aside from the fact that he gets powers after getting bitten by a Radioactive Spider which is why this movie skipped over that part. Now, lets talk about the real issues this movie suffers from. This is a spiderman movie where Peter Parker is the main protagonist, he was suppose to be this smart and genius guy, but he is just naive, young and cocky throughout the half of the movie and makes a lot of dumb mistakes. Half of the time, you will wonder where are even his powers? Heck, the movie never ever explores his spidey senses either. It is just suit and high-techs that is doing his job. It feels like anyone can be a spider-man as long as Tony Stark is backing you up, and don't you just love the whole ""giving up the job, suit and powers for brief moment and getting back up"" clich√É¬©. On top of that, it felt like this movie was made for little kids, you might have not noticed, but throughout the entire movie spiderman/peter parker never once bled during any of the fight scenes. I got confused that maybe i am watching a censored or less gory version, but this is how it is. I get it, he is a superhero, but show some struggle on his face and body too like he is really beaten up, tired and exhausted during his fight against various enemies. <br/><br/>-But, truly the final nail in the coffin for me is the amount of PC culture that this movie suffers from. We have a short midget Indian Flash who i can't quite understand his character, he picks on Peter Parker, but sometimes slaps his arse too, PP's Asian side-kick and holymoly, black MJ, and that does it for me. Its not even trying anymore, what are we gonna have next? Gay/transgender superheroes? I am not against any sexuality or gender, but don't change already established character which have been there for about 60-70 years now. Its like baiting the true fans of the already established superheroes and altering their personality and sex. Just simply create a new superhero with different characters and give whatever traits you feel like. I fear we are only gonna see more of it from here on in future, the marvel comics already suffers from it and the low sales fully describe they have hit new bottom low with Female thor, black captain America, black spider-man etc, next comes the MCU."

"bartonbettyl","8","3","4","2 July 2019"," Such a relief!
","It's 2:30am and I just finished watching Homecoming because I have a ticket for Far From Home for tomorrow night (wait, technically TONIGHT), but I kept putting off watching Homecoming over and over and over because the Sony movies wasted SO much of my time and money and made me SO sick of Spider-Man SO much that I just... HATED... Spider-Man. EVEN AFTER seeing (and loving) him in Civil War, Infinity War, AND End Game, I kept thinking ""I should really watch Homecoming"", and my brain STILL just kept responding with ""...eh."" and finding something else to do. It couldn't deal with sitting down to another disappointment.<br/><br/>... I LOVED this movie. Tom is an adorable, hilarious, wonderful Spider-Man, and an adorable, hilarious, wonderful teenager. Both Spider-Man and Peter Parker are written and acted like real, authentic people rather than characters written solely because ""welp, gotta keep those movie rights, so...""<br/><br/>Aunt Mae is a lot better than I thought from the like, one trailer I saw. I expected a lot more ""ha ha it's funny because she's sexy!"" but actually, she was fine - and Tony's comments are limited to one.<br/><br/>The kids written around Peter are all pretty fun, too. Out of them all I think only Flash stood out in a bad way - and I wouldn't blame the actor on that one, the character just came off as a lazily-written bully.<br/><br/>My other complaint is that, while not going for an origin story was DEFINITELY the best thing they could do, it did feel a LITTLE bit like they needed to fill in a FEW more holes, which could have been done with less additional villains. I did like how they mostly just sort of quietly had them in there btw, no ""HEY LOOK AT ALL THE VILLAINS IN THIS MOVIE GUYS, MORE VILLAINS AUTOMATICALLY EQUALS BETTER, RIGHT!?!?"" But still... remove some unnecessary scenes with them, and explain to us WHAT it was Aunt Mae is going through (or just leave that line out, because honestly, she's an aunt, raising a teenager, alone. That's enough explanation for her behaving as she does.)<br/><br/>Michelle is a great character. Again, I love the way they put her in there. They didn't trumpet it, they didn't hint at it, she just quietly kept popping up, gaining my affection with every moment she was on-screen, until that delightful moment when it was pretty firmly confirmed that she's not going anywhere for at least one future movie.<br/><br/>And the villain. WOW, the villain. Although I always try and avoid spoilers as much as possible, I did hear a lot of talk at the time of release about how much people liked Keaton's villain. And I spent most of the movie going ""ehhhhhh... he's o..KAY? I guess?"", that beautiful moment when they reveal his connection with Spider-Man - UGH! AGAIN with just letting it HAPPEN! No teasing, no massive screaming hints, no underlining the connection ten times going DO YOU GET IT? DO YOU GET IT GUYS? DO YOU GET IT? LOOK WHAT WE DID GUYS! WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU GET WHAT WE DID! Just... oh hey, remember this guy? And I was as stunned as Peter was. LOVED it. A small, quiet, slow introduction to the concept which immediately changed EVERYTHING about what I'd watched before. Looooooooved iiiiiiiiit!<br/><br/>And DONALD GLOVER! As AARON DAVIS! Oh YES, I'm so happy! And I completely missed that in the movie! I just loved his character and was happy enough as it was, so I'm glad a reviewer I watched immediately after brought it up, because it excites and delights me - both because I REALLY want to see Glover as the Prowler, oh please please pleeeeeeeeease let that be a thing in future movies, and also because it means Miles Davis exists, and considering I am still riding a high from how much I loved Into the Spider-Verse, I REALLY want to see WAY more Miles Morales, and continuing how much Marvel continues to learn as they go... I really do have high hopes for what they could do with it.<br/><br/>And Happy! Geez, I love Happy. He kind of sneaks his way into your heart, and he got a lot of screen time here, which was great.<br/><br/>And Ned! Oh, Ned. Ned is a wonderful, wonderful best friend. He was very reminiscent of Nick Frost's character in Hot Fuzz - an ordinary, normal, everyday sorta person who just wants to be a badass. I mean... don't we all? His moment of glory with the web shooters was a lovely touch. And actually, while I'm on the subject, THAT is another thing I like about this movie - how it takes a bit of time to show what it's like being ""the little guy"" in a world full of superheroes. Buildings in ruins, jobs given and taken away (although I will say that was one nitpick about Keaton's character's origin: I mean, c'mon, how stupid do you have to be to figure that you can totally just SALVAGE deadly alien technology and nobody's gonna say 'boo' to that?) But back to Ned. I was a bit disappointed he only participated in a tiny bit of the final battle. I get Peter's arc had to have him alone for a bit but Ned got cut out REALLY early and ""I was looking at porn"" was, eh, a again felt like a lazy joke. I felt that could have been written better. STILL. Overall, don't care, Ned is fun and I like him and want more of him.<br/><br/>Aaaaaaaand caaaaaaaaan Iiiiiiiiiii juuuuuuuuuust saaaaaaaaaaaay....<br/><br/>I. LOVE.BOKEEM WOODBINE. I first experienced him in Fargo, and he was just SUCH a DELICIOUSLY menacing character, yet so suave and so cool, I was so disappointed at his eventual end! (Even if it totally made sense in Fargo's world, and in the world of that specific season.) I LOVED getting to see him flexing his charming menacing muscles again - even if it was somewhat short-lived, I do hope to see more of him in future movies - I can see them easily fitting him in as he'd just gotten his tech in this movie, so as with Peter, the guy just needs some practice, a better suit... he could be a FANTASTIC villain for a future movie! And frankly because of how great he was in Fargo, I think if they give him a decent role to run with, he could easily rival Hiddleston in any ""Marvel's most charismatic villain"" contest.<br/><br/>Kenneth Choi... I KNEW that guy looked familiar!! I love that he played his own grandfather. I'm also curious how many other little inside moments like this I miss. There are so many times when I look at a face and just KNOW I've seen it somewhere before...<br/><br/>Mr. Harrington! Intriguing JUST for the ""not again..."" line. That's one moment where I'm not REALLY annoyed that they didn't go into detail. I mean they could, and I'd watch it, but it's a beautiful moment where your brain is absolutely already filling in the details itself just based on that one single line - delivered beautifully and then just left alone.<br/><br/>I'm sure I'm missing some... I mean, it was PACKED with fun, and fun people - but it's 3am, and I gotta sleep. It's definitely a movie I'm going to revisit at least once to enjoy watching it from that completely different POV of knowing what's coming. And I'm very much looking forward to seeing the next movie tomorrow.<br/><br/>... I mean, tonight."

It finds the longings of a young man to be worthy of himself and to others and be independent of others who can take responsibility for his own actions. The cast makes this one of the more lighthearted films in the MCU universe and probably one of the more relatable and attractive superhero films to its young audience."
"srdonkarnage","6","3","4","24 November 2018"," Tom Holland is great, but I miss the self-made Spider-man
","I give this film a 6 because it was pretty enjoyable in the moment. Tom Holland is excellent as Peter Parker/Spider-man, and it made for a good time at the movies. That being said, the creative decisions that were made to incorporate and integrate the webslinger into the Marvel Cinematic Universe really ruined Peter's backstory and really all that made Spider-man an underdog hero to root for. Tony Stark literally gives Peter everything he needs and then some. I missed the Peter Parker who sewed his suit himself and endlessly experimented (and often failed) to create his tech and hone his skills. This may seem like a small thing to gripe over, but I believe these things were essential to Spider-Man's character. Instead, we just get a clever kid who ends up getting everything he wants handed to him.<br/><br/>If you can forgive all that, you'll likely enjoy Homecoming."

","Spider-Man: Homecoming is a MCU movie and if you are familiar with other titles, you can imagine how this movie works.
Part of becoming a hero is skipped and it's a big plus, since we know it already and seen it thousands of times. The movie shows that expectations about being superhero may differ from reality and that makes Spider-Man a bit different from other superhero movies.
Since Spider-Man is a 'teen' in this movie, Tom Holland act like one and he does a great job. Making Spider-Man younger again didn't make movie childish. Of course it's not serious drama movie and you shouldn't expect it from Spider-Man, but the movie can entertain adults just as kids, just because it's not filled with too much fantasy and unbelievable stuff. Jokes fits perfectly and are not overwhelming. If you are looking for fun family movie - this one is probably the best pick from whole MCU movie collection. <br/><br/>It's easy to watch, entertaining and filled with good humor- go for it."

"maxmages","7","3","4","29 November 2017"," Spiderman, Spiderman, comes home like a spider can
","Now what can I say it is the Marvel Most Moderate Spiderman movie of all, with a big ethnic different cast and I know it sounds weird because I'm a foreigner myself a bit too much. It's one of the few MCU movies that can not stand on its own, but in a few places it has too many jokes, but at least it's really funny. Spiderman Homecoming is absolutely awesome, super fun exciting and has every five minutes any things that tickle your nerves and bring your feelings to light. I also find the new style that the films take with the modernization of the optical look and, above all, the size of the film is very appealing. The old Spiderman movies by Sam Remmi will always have a special place in my heart but these are films for other times. In addition, this movie contains in what most films, not superhero films but most of the films are missing in all danger. The danger of failing to be humbled the danger etc. Rarely have I really had the feeling that the characters in a movie are in danger this film shows us the danger and delivers it to us correctly and that's best because we can take the danger seriously. Tom Holland is awesome and Michael Keaton ages like good wine. But though I like all the characters, Peter's best friend is a bit strange it does not quite fit in with the world of Spiderman. The character of Michelle (MJ) got on my nerves so hard I can put it into words like is a Lisa Simpson 2.0 and it's always a downer it's unbelievable, the pacing and up movies is just in a nutshell and it is wonderful. But why are the 50s high school drama aspects repeating? Why do all the battles take place at night? And what does the police actually film in the superheroes?<br/><br/>The fights are super uninteresting and repeat in their moves again and again, the direction of the action is directly on MTV quality and this is not a movie but a huge advertising space for the MCU. Call it ""Peter Parker: Iron Man Jr."" What the movie does best .... It's just that it was a remake, tribute, reissue or adaptation. 1. Enough nostalgia references for the old fans. 2. create enough own for the new fans. 3. enough explanations for those who have no idea but want to know why it works and 4. The most important! A natural interest arouse so that you feel like you have to deal more with this franchise."
"RolloTomasi","8","3","4","10 October 2017"," Holland is the best Spider Man. This version HAD to be different
","I've read other reviewers take issue with Tony Stark inventing a suit for Parker to use. This is a version of the Iron Spider armor Stark created for him in the Earth 616 universe. Ironically, it's when Spider Man and Iron Man end up on different sides during the comic Civil War, that he ditches the armor. <br/><br/>I've read other reviewers take issue with the supporting characters in Peter's world and school. They turned Flash into a nerd. They turned Aunt May into a younger woman. They left out the origin story (but we know that it's still a spider bit that gave him his powers. There are slightly racist reviews that take issue with the ""diversity."" Well first, the high school is in New York City, a very racially diverse city as everyone knows. We've already had 2 cracks at a Spider Man franchise, in very recent history, so the makers of Homecoming had a challenge on their hands: How to make this one feel very different. <br/><br/>They succeed and do it in such a way that Spider Man could now be re-launched for a generation. Holland could play him for decades. It is set up so that the Spider Man franchise can slowly distance itself from the larger Marvel CU but still dip its toe in once in a while. Now that the Iron Man and Captain America story arcs seem to be coming to an end, Marvel needs Spider Man, its signature character, to be able to live on for a long time--longer than any other character it's translated to film. <br/><br/>Spider Man: Homecoming is good. One reviewer pointed out, as an insult, that it was trying to be a John Hughes film. I thought that was an interesting point. I mean, it is a film about high school kids so why not? It pays a nice homage to (Hughes') Ferris Bueller's Day Off, and the kids are foul mouthed and a little bit too ""real"" at times. Many parents will not be comfortable with some of this content (myself included). <br/><br/>There is a great action scene in the 2nd act where Spider Man finds himself having to rescue his classmates from a failing, disabled elevator at the top of the Washington Monument. His only way in is one of the small windows near the base of the monument's peak. He is freaking out because he's never been up this high before. He has to overcome that fear and use the police helicopter that's hunting him to give him the thrust he needs to bust through. This is one example of why Peter Parker is an interesting character. He is, at this point in his story, still just trying to figure out his own life, and figure out his limitations. <br/><br/>Spider Man: Homecoming will be the beginning of a long series of films for Marvel, surely. Hopefully they keep Tom Holland in the role. He really gets it right. He can ""grow up"" into the role as the character advances in experience. But please no more reboots."

","There are moments, but his is easily the worst Avenger's related movie to date. I never read Marvel comics, I was always a DC guy. Or I should say kid as I left them behind pretty young. But the Avenger's movies have been pretty good.<br/><br/>Nothing against the actors, who are all quite personable, especially the leads, but there's just something off about the whole approach. Exactly how long does it take to convey teen angst? Get on with it for heaven's sake. Like many a modern movie, this one's too long and filled with characters and scenes that could've been omitted. The Avengers flicks can get away with this because all the heroes are interesting. Peter's school chums, not so much.<br/><br/>From what I understand, Spiderman fans might find this truer to the spirit of the original character, but non-fans will probably wonder what happened to their Avenger movie. In that vein, this is the first that isn't on my re-watch list.<br/><br/>Ultimately, for my taste--completely forgettable."

","This particular Spiderman movie is definitely not the best of the lot. The movie is a fairly good movie with all the right amounts of humour, action and explosions, but still fails in terms of the story and character development. <br/><br/>Things I did not like were how they have reduced Peter Parker to be like a sidekick to Iron Man. Spiderman's greatest strength was his intellect, and this film does not justify it. The villain is not imposing enough and I was feeling as if the film was portrayed as a teen flick. <br/><br/>The actors have done a good job but with a little bit of more character in the story line, this would have been a much better movie. I still think Sam Raimi's Spiderman was the best of the lot."
"leonblackwood","4","4","6","1 January 2018"," Poor Reboot!
","Review:
Although this movie made a massive profit, I really didn't enjoy it, mainly because it seemed like it was made for kids. The storyline also wasn't that great, and the whole ""college student"" element got on my nerves after a while. After watching the introduction of the new Spiderman in Captain America: Civil War, I was quite excited about this movie but it turned out to be a big let down. Anyway, Tom Holland takes the lead from Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker, and he's out to impress Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) so he can become an Avenger. With Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) keeping a close eye on him, he goes through school hoping to get the call to be involved in a mission but he ends up taking on a mission of his own, to try and prove that he has the ability to become an Avenger. Whilst serving the public in minor missions, he finally comes across a bunch of bank robbers, who use some fancy weapons which have never been seen before. When he tries to warn Tony Stark, he brushes him off, so he is forced to find out were these weapons come from, with the help of his close friend Ned (Jacob Batalon). When he finds out the root of the source, he tries to use all of his super human powers to take him down but he's pushed to the limit, which makes him question if he is ready to join the Avengers. Its quite a simple storyline which joins onto the other Marvel movies but the director wasted to much time on silly scenes which eventually become irrelevant. Michael Keaton really did save the day in this movie, along with Downey Jr. and Favreau but the main character became irritating and quite annoying. The suit looked impressive and some of the action scenes were half decent but they were not in the same league as the action scenes in Spiderman 2, when he is fighting against Doc Ock. I don't really have high expectations for the next movie in this franchise but I'm hoping that he will make an appearance in Avengers: Infinity War which is due to be released next year with the cast of the Guardians of the Galaxy, and Dr. Strange. Disappointing!<br/><br/>Round-Up:
This movie was written by Jon Watts, 36, who also brought you Clown in 2014, and Cop Car in 2015. Judging by his previous projects, I'm surprised that he was chosen to take on such a huge franchise, especially after the disappointing Amazing Spiderman reboot. I'm sure the studios are happy with the profit this movie made but that's not to say that this movie was actually any good. With the DC comics releasing there blockbusters in the near future, Jon Watts really needs to step up, before this gets canned like the poor Batman and Superman reboots. Anyway, at 21 years old, Tom Holland has really hit the jackpot with a role in the Marvel camp, and with the Impossible, How I Live Now, Locke and In The Heart Of The Sea behind him, he hasn't done too bad so far. He's also been cast as Nathan Drake in the upcoming Uncharted movie so he has a lot to look forward to but I personally think that we need to see a serious side to Spiderman, because this jokey side has been done to death.<br/><br/>Budget: $175million
Worldwide Gross: $880.2million<br/><br/>Genre: Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi
Cast: Tom Holland, Michael Keaton, Robert Downey Jr., Marisa Tomei, Jon Favreau, Gwyneth Paltrow, Zendaya, Donald Glover, Bokeem Woodbine and Tyne Daly. 4/10"

","I have seen all three versions of the Spider-Man movies in theaters growing up. Recently, I watched this movie with my dad and I thought it was pretty interesting. <br/><br/>Yet, I am still seeing the structure that the movie is trying to follow with Parker being the outcast of this Brooklyn science academy. But really in my opinion, this movie is really just an updated version of how the newer generation wants to see Spider-Man, Young, strong, and maybe even sexy.<br/><br/>I still loved this movie's creative output in context to previous Spider-Man movies I have seen in the past. Still though, I will always love Sam Rami's version just a little better. But in my mind, this Spider-Man made for the newer generation would come in second place.<br/><br/>Can't wait to see what tricks he pulls of in the infinity war!"
"oceanmaya","5","4","6","21 July 2017"," Disappointing version and lacking spirit of Spiderman
","When Spiderman came out on Civil War, I was so excited. Clearly he stole scenes there even though he appeared too briefly. Finally, we have an actor who is so fit for the role, that young energetic who's probably too smart for his own good kid with a non-stop smart-alec mouth while fighting the bad guys. And true to Spidey, his fight gets always creative the way he toppled the big Ant-Man in that scene. So I was very excited that he gets his own movie. I just saw it today and it was a big disappointment.<br/><br/>So I was wondering how the hell did this get 8 out of 10? And the reviewers here are all coordinated. I can only say that with all the money that Marvel got, these are paid reviewers. This film is nowhere close to Sam Raimi's Spiderman. In fact, the Amazing Spiderman was better, although Sam Raimi's Spiderman 2 was the best. <br/><br/>So going to Tom Holland, he was cast well and fits the role of a high school kid. What's lacking in the movie is the spirit. Here we have Spiderman relying on Spidersuit developed by Tony Stark. It maybe a welcome addition but it kind of reflects the smartphones of today making everyone dumb. In the comics, Spiderman was so much more than the suit: he was one of those superheroes who can easily kick the ass of Ironman or most on the Avengers team. He was also very independent that he was never part of the Avengers but just that they constantly cross paths fighting the same bad guy. And in this sense he crossovers to the world of Fantastic Four and X-men due to his unique ability. So what was missing in the movie and what makes Spiderman such a bad ass? Spider Sense. This was lacking in the movie. Here he has to rely on an AI called Karen to tell him what to do. In the comics, Spiderman was very formidable mainly because of his Spider Sense that he was almost pre-cognizant. In this movie, normal humans equipped with high-tech weapons can easily hit him. It's all good trying to adapt Spiderman to the Millenials but they forgot the true spirit. So I guess you're better off watching Sam Raimi's series."

","I came I watched. Another Spiderman movie from some brainchild over at Sony who feels somehow that we need ANOTHER reboot of this Marvel arachnified offering and of course the truth is that Sony doesn't want to give up the franchise hence they must honor Marvel film commitment. BUT the one thing I am most grateful for is that they didn't SHOW THE BLOODY SPIDER BITE ORIGIN SEQUENCE. Had enough of that already. The film is well made and well processed through the commercial filter that programs us to like what we see before us and that process seems ever so predictable as my body clock ticks onward. It does have some interesting juvenile based dialogue (because Peter Parker is only 15 in this film, why not SPIDER-BOY?)and the high school characters are all plausibly comical in their post pubescent glory. I felt manipulated and partially gangrene by the time this film was over yet I did enjoy the wondrous presence of Michael Keaton who thanks to Birdman (he practically reprises that role in this film), has again graced our panoramic vision of present day cinema and I am ever so grateful he has returned to us like the prodigal son or uncle might be more appropriate. The acting, the special effects are all well and fine and blah blah blah yet somehow I was sick a might in the core of my gut to have been back in a theater seat to gaze upon SPIDER-MAN predictably going to unravel the villain and return to Auntie May (nicely updated by the gorgeous Miss Tomei), and do the usual BS only to return 2 years later in yet another sequel coming soon in 3d Imax in 2019. I am saddened that Hollywood insists on putting out more recycled sludge and apparently doesn't have much of a unique idea in its hollow head anymore. Yet this film is what it is and the key factor for most of you is entertainment and that it is. Im just sick of this kind of entertainment."
"nonomkay","6","4","6","14 July 2017"," Spidey on training wheels
","First, let me say that the concept of this Spiderman is a sort of light hearted family friendly adventure that would do well for young families. Spidey (Tom Holland) captures the geeky and generally harmless, yet sympathetic and morally driven, character that we all known and love. <br/><br/>My issues with the movie are subtle gripes with character development, casting, and the title of the movie itself. The title of ""Spiderman: Homecoming"" shot a little off the mark, considering a mere 5-10 minutes was covered between Peter Parker and Liz Allen (Laura Harrier) out of a 2 and a 1/2 hour film, which seems a tad pointless to me. A more appropriate title for this film would be ""Spiderman: the Stark Internship"", considering that was his primary focus through the entire film. Next, I have a similar issue with casting like I had with Wonder Woman: an older actor like Michael Keaton (Vulture) could not bring the boom/energy that we have come to expect from the likes of Willem Dafoe (Green Goblin) and arguably Jamie Foxx (Electro) in the newer Andrew Garfield revision. And finally, the issue of character development... Aunt May was a side dish whereas her considerable acting talents could have played a larger role, and this could be said of other characters. I would have liked to see more time spent on character development and plot than how much time was covered with the academic championship and some of the other less integral scenes in the movie. <br/><br/>In summation, this is a good film, but my recommendation to anyone, as my mother would say, is: ""wait until its on DVD""."
"mb1456","7","4","6","13 July 2017"," Lots of Humor and Very Good Effects But the Action Disappoints
","After we got to see a preview of actor Tom Holland as the new Spiderman in Captain America: Civil War, I must say he has grown into the character with this movie and is very likable. Moviegoers worldwide have kinda accepted him with open arms as the new Spidey just like they did with Ben Affleck as Batman. I find Michael Keaton better as a villain here than the Batman he once himself essayed decades ago. He was great in this movie. Marisa Tomei was a wrong choice as Aunt May compared to the mature, elderly look we were used to over the years and also I think such roles don't do justice to her talent. Laura Harrier as Spidey's love interest did good but had a weak, forgettable role. The action & the effects(especially) are good and there's lot of hilarious moments too yet I felt the comedy in the Tobey Maguire Spiderman movies were more natural and adorable. Also, the climax confrontation between Spidey and the Vulture was damp in its intensity and didn't feel bang for the buck. Otherwise, this Spider-man movie is a funny, clean entertainer and very watchable with family too."
"themagical-28643","7","4","6","11 July 2017"," Spiderman or Iron Man 5/6?
","I found this movie reasonably enjoyable and I loved the way it wasn't another origin story film, I think we have had more that enough of those at this point. I really enjoyed the fact that went back to the story line where Peter Parker had created the web shooters himself. I also like the way it connected well with the other Marvel movies and helps to keep you tied into the overall Marvel Universe. But to me it did feel like an Iron man movie at points ... not that it is necessarily a bad thing, but at least it didn't end sitting on Bruce Banners psychiatrist couch."
"Starlitelet","7","14","31","1 July 2017"," Not the best Spiderman movie, but Tom Holland is a gem!
","I remember when I first saw Tom Holland in Captain America: Civil War, I knew he had a lot of charisma for the Spiderman role. The only skepticism I had for the reboot was, can the story or feeling I once had for Spiderman come back? Spider-Man(2002) and Spider-Man 2(2004) are one of the greatest superhero movies up to date. It was an awesome introduction to the superhero universe, and it utterly made me fall in love with the characters. Just for reference, Spiderman is still my favourite superhero.<br/><br/>After watching the early screening for Spider-Man: Homecoming, I will still say that the Spiderman movies we knew 13 years ago are still unbeatable out of the 6 movies we have gotten. Don't get me wrong. I still had fun with this movie, but it didn't feel like a Spiderman movie. It felt like a side story of an Avengers movie. And that disappointed me. We are constantly reminded that Spiderman is a second class to the Avengers team or this is an introduction to the upcoming Avengers movie. I would have much preferred to see Spiderman as the standalone Spiderman. That was my main gripe.<br/><br/>Moving along, Tom Holland is not only the youngest, but also the most charismatic, and comedic character or actor from the three Spiderman we have seen on-screen. He plays a believable high school student who is struggling to find his identity. He balances well between learning the ropes of being Spiderman, while at the same time trying to be a normal high school kid. However, there is something missing in his character. His struggles are resolved too easily and quickly. Everything comes off as comedic or gets resolved by the help of a third party. There were no consequences for his actions. Moreover, the other supporting characters lack depth. We don't get a backstory on them. Michelle played by Zendaya and Liz played by Laura Harrier could have been played by anyone. The character Flash seemed like a miscast for me. He was out of place and his physique let alone his character did not match. On the other hand, Ned was an awesome character. He really worked well with Peter Parker. Furthermore, the main antagonist played by Michael Keaton is nowhere near as in-depth as Green Goblin or Doctor Oc. I will say that he is one of the better villains we have had in superhero movies these days though. There is more to his character that might surprise you, and that was what took this movie to a higher level for me. Also, Michael Keaton does a great job because sometimes he does truly scare you with just his eyes! <br/><br/>The story is simple, but it works well in this case. There are a lot of banters and one-liners. Some were funny, and others felt repetitive. In fact, it had all the comedy, lightheartedness, and humour that a Spiderman movie should have. Nonetheless, it lacks depth and emotions. Even though we get to experience the struggles of Peter Parker's teenage-hood as mentioned, nothing is ultimately at stake here. For all the chaos that was happening, the body count was very small.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is nowhere near as memorable as the Danny Elfman soundtracks. I still believe that the Danny Elfman Spiderman theme song is one of the best superhero theme songs out there next to Dark Knight and Wonder Woman. Every time the theme song is playing, you know it's Spiderman! That's how memorable it is. I wish they could reuse that.<br/><br/>The action scenes were kinda shaky. I did not see everything very well. They were not as visceral as the Sam Raimi movies. In fact, I re-watched some of the action sequences from Spider-Man 2, and they are still better choreographed than this one. However, keep in mind, that this is not an action packed movie. It is mostly about Spiderman figuring out his abilities. The movie is not an introduction to Peter Parker taking the mantle as Spiderman, but how Peter Parker transitions from not being ""Spiderboy"" anymore (slowly).<br/><br/>I still prefer Sam Raimi's classic take on the Spiderman costume. In here it looks a bit CGI, and too much like ""Iron Man"". Another reason why it reminds me of Avengers all over again.<br/><br/>I sound like I really hated this movie, but I don't. I enjoyed it for what it was. I was just expecting more from a Spiderman movie, so I am more critical.<br/><br/>7.5"

So patronizing, esp. with Pepper reduced to an emotional footnote.

The high school dynamic of a teenage Peter Parker really sort of works here.<br/><br/>Michael Keaton. If there is one reason I could give to see this movie, it would be Michaels portrayal of the Vulture. At long last a ""Marvel"" movie introduces not only a good villain, played by a great actor, but they've given him an arc that makes sense. In this movie, you get Adrian Toomes, and kind of agree with him. I found myself thinking ""Hey, you know what, he's got a point!"", rather than the typical Marvel fare of the hero battling some nameless thing shooting up into the sky.<br/><br/>The annoying thing about Homecoming is the fact that it uses the greater MCU as a crutch to make it work.

Now, I found that the story-line of Spiderman: Homecoming was quite impressive, starting by being original, finally the story of spider-man is joined with The Avengers. In addition to that, Peter Parker has a love interest that never appeared before, as well as his best friend. Apart from the story-line, I found that the emerging villain of the movie was good, and the story behind him was well told, but they should have dedicated more time to explain his arising. And finally the most important detail of the movie, thanks to the work of Tony Stark of course, Spiderman is now a modern superhero, with all kind of ""web weapons"", for example a web grenade, or an instant kill combat mode. Without mentioning the music from the motion picture, at the beginning of the movie we can listen to the original theme from the comics of spider-man, that was a great idea Summarizing, this new spider-man movie is very original and I believe it is the best of all times, because it offers us the most realistic spider-man of all, and because of the great movie of course, according to the details given on this text."

This movie with its uniqueness did a great job of portraying Spider-Man and his teenage life. <br/><br/>Bad: The action sequences were good, but lacked hand to hand combat and relied more on web shooting. The finale lacked suspense and action. Some parts of the movie can be slow or boring. Although Michael Keaton was fantastic as Vulture I found his motive weak and not effective. <br/><br/>Overall: It is worth the watch, but do not expect anything spectacular or amazing.

"thaisetdambros","8","6","11","26 October 2017"," The most faithful Spider-Man movie adaptation
","The latest Spider-Man movie did not surprise me at all. Just like all the superhero movies ever released, it follows the same old directions. I get that having the same structure is what makes them work and be liked, but after some time we just end up getting tired of it. And in the case of Homecoming, we were given a third version of the same story. I mean, I like Spidey and all, and don't get me wrong, I liked this movie, but I just feel like Marvel could have invested their time and money on bringing a different character from the comics to the big screen.<br/><br/>Okay, now that I got that out of my chest, I'll start talking about the movie. Like many of us know, Peter Parker was bitten by a radioactive spider and gained spider-like powers. However, unlike the first Spider-Man trilogy, this movie doesn't focus on the development of these powers. It's mainly about Peter struggling to find his way as a teenager as well as a superhero. Something that I really liked was that Marvel cast appropriate actors to bring the characters to life. Unlike the other trilogies, this time we don't have 30-year-olds playing 17-year-olds. The cast is also very diverse, perhaps the most diverse cast Marvel has ever had until now. Kudos to that! Tom Holland's acting amazed me. I wasn't sure about him at first, but he certainly did a great job. His performance was remarkable, I mean, not Oscar-worthy, but for a superhero movie, it was more than enough. Peter was very likable and often relatable. Perhaps because the actors were younger, they were more convincing. Therefore, Homecoming was the most faithful adaptation from the original Spider-Man comic books.<br/><br/>I don't remember much about the soundtrack or visual effects because, for me, it's not something that stands out, it's only OK. What captured my attention and kept me interest was the humor. Classic Marvel humor, if you ask me, but very effective. A little bit forced sometimes, but it's something you can choose to ignore, because it's better to have too much humor rather than none.<br/><br/>Something important that I would like to add is that before I watched the movie I had formed an opinion based on the trailers and the posters: I thought this was going to be Iron Man 4, because Tony Stark was appearing too much. It's really different when you watch the movie. He has an important role in Peter's life, of course, but his screen time was basically what was shown in the trailers. Phew! So, if maybe this was a reason that was keeping you from watching Homecoming, I can say that you're good to go.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a good, interesting movie. It's light and well-made, however it's not the kind of movie you want to watch over and over again because it's so good. I would recommend you to watch it with friends on movie night, if you do that kind of stuff. It will make you laugh √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú and, if you're very sensitive like me, you may shed a tear or two."
"mihai_aliman","5","6","11","11 July 2017"," Ambiguous morally, unconvincing hero
","Marvel proposed another kind of Spider-Man, free from all the bad reboots. The film pictures Peter Parker, much younger than the previous versions, in an unexplainable and selfish attempt to catch the attention of Tony Stark (more on that later). He is still the nerdy, awkward, super smart teenage boy, but this time portrayed in a much racially diverse and politically correct environment: his love interest, Liz, is black, his best friend, Ned, is Filipino, his bully, Flash, appears to be of Indian origin. There are only hints of Peter's life up to this point, nothing very explicit. Not starting the story arc from the beginning might have been a good thing, nobody wanted to see Uncle Ben die again. But still, the Uncle played a very important role in the origin story, as the father-figure and the voice of reason acting as the decisive factor in Peter's coming of age. This adaption doesn't have such a figure. Aunt May, she too, much younger than previous films, is only the preoccupied mother-figure, with only general interest in her nephew, lacking any deep emotional connection with the protagonist. Happy Hogan, the appointed supervisor, doesn't seem to care about him very much, trying to constantly avoid talking to him. Tony Stark is the closest thing Peter has to a Uncle Ben, but their relationship is troublesome. We are somehow left to believe that the only interest Stark has in him is in building a new avenger. He gives him a suit and lets him learn how to use it, without offering proper advise or moral indication as to what it means to be a superhero what so ever. The hero is left to figure his stuff out, living with the ideal of being an Avenger, but without knowing the deep implications of engaging in a heroic act. If he should succeed, then Stark got himself a new weapon. If not, then he is to be stopped from pursuing the superhero business. This situation results in some moral ambiguity. In the previous adaptations, it was easy to distinguish the bad guys from the good ones. They did the generic bad guy staff (robbed banks, murdered innocent people etc.) either having no moral compass, or being controlled by evil forces. Peter was driven by stopping them for the greater good, himself being raised by his notorious relatives with a high degree of morality. But in this movie, the only reason of Peter being a hero is to impress Stark and be part of the Avengers. This selfish drive makes him even cherish when a crime is in progress, so that he can show off his skills. The villain, Vulture, is a mafia boss running an illegal gun factory that uses stolen alien technology. Because of this, we are left to believe he is the bad guy. His most despicable act is killing a disobedient subordinate (a bad guy himself). He is an avid entrepreneur, keen on keeping his business running and his family happy. He doesn't want to destroy the world, or take over the city with his weapons. He doesn't want power, and is afraid of law, especially the Avengers. This makes him an atypical villain. He is not the selfish one here, Peter is. Producing weapons and selling them is blameworthy, but then again, this is exactly how Stark made his fortune, with the only difference that he was (probably) selling them legally. Peter can't wait to take down any guy, and uses his power only with the apparent reason of doing justice, without thinking about the consequences. Any action he involves himself in turns out really bad, with numerous peoples life put in great danger. Without his implication, an ATM would have been robbed, some weapons would have been sold, and some alien artefacts would have been stolen. Wicked things, but without any direct civilian casualties. Peter is so disastrously bad at preventing those things that Stark is forced to confiscate his suit, the principal source of his powers up to this point. The selfish Peter is now gone. Without being an Avenger at stake, he can now rejoice in his normal urban life. He even manages to overcome his timidity and asks his crush on prom. The biggest moral dilemma so far awaits him. His girlfriends father, is the Vulture. He is offered the chance to do nothing. This would result in the stealing of alien technology and the commercialization of more weapons. He chooses to implicate himself once again, this time without the help of the suit. His drive is ambiguous. Impressing Stark is out of the picture, but standing down means he is a accomplice. It's important to mention that Peter doesn't really know what Vulture is up to at the moment he decides to intervene. This would 've been a great time to emphasize Peter's morality, but we are left wondering if he chooses to action just because he sees this as the opportunity to redeem himself in the eyes of Stark, or because he simply wants to do the right thing. I believe it was the first reason that really drove Peter. When he managed to track down Vulture and find out his plan, the wisest action in his situation would be to inform Stark or the police about it. Even if the Vulture would not have been stopped in that instant, Peter knew his identity and he could easily follow him and find out where he took the stolen cargo. Alone and without his suit, he stood no chance of defeating the villain safely. He somehow decides to do the crazy thing and stop him with his bare web, knowing that it would not have been such a big deal after all, if Vulture stole those artifacts. I think he does this just to prove himself again, and ends up crashing a plane dangerously near the city. It looks good, feels fine, but they messed up the plot with an unconvincing hero."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","6","11","8 July 2017"," Nice! More like high-school comedy, until last third of movie
","Rather than a ""regular"" Spiderman continuation, this movie is a sequel to last year's ""Captain America: Civil War"" (an Avengers story under that misleading title) which introduced Tom Holland's brilliant interpretation of adolescent Peter Parker/Spiderman. Therein, Tony Stark was sufficiently impressed by Peter to now recruit him to be an Avenger-in-training, under the cover of a high school Stark-sponsored internship.<br/><br/>While the plot line entertains with the buffoonery persona of Peter the high school student, Spiderman keeps getting into trouble by trying to bring an ultra-modern weapon trafficking cartel into justice (despite Stark's repeated cautioning). The narrative cuts back and forth between the life of the high school kid (hence the title, the homecoming prom) and the repeated blundering of Spiderman.<br/><br/>Running parallel with Spiderman's trajectory is the villain, Vulture, who eight years ago acquired mind-boggling technology by secretly retaining some salvaged Avenger headquarter wreckage he was supposed to turn over to Stark. As a result, like Ironman, he developed a ""suit"" that gives him superhero power. How powerful? Vulture makes the Avengers' new recruit Falcon (not appearing in this movie) look like a harmless little sparrow.<br/><br/>As mentioned in my summary line, the tone changes in the last 45 minutes. Peter is overjoyed to have the girl he has a crush on to be his homecoming prom escort, only to find that she is the daughter of Vulture with whom he has had a brief encounter in one of his earlier blunders. Not exactly an innovative plot twist but serviceable nonetheless.<br/><br/>There are several main themes running through this movie. First, there is the father-son relationship, with Stark as surrogate father to Peter.<br/><br/>Second, it is sort of coming-of-age story of Peter. Stark being Stark, the new suit he designs for Peter is absolutely overwhelming (with the beautiful voice of Jennifer Connelly as the ""suit lady"" that Peter fondly nicknames Karen). Both finally realize that it suffocates the real Spiderman underneath. Stark takes it back. Peter learns by bitter experience that he is Spiderman NOT because of the suit, but because of himself.<br/><br/>Third, more mundane, is the dilemma of finding that your love interest's father is the villain you are pursuing.<br/><br/>Now to the players.<br/><br/>While this is entirely subjective, I won't be surprised if a substantial portion of fans share my view that Tom Holland is the best Spiderman to-date. Michael Keaton, never dull to watch, serves this movie well as the villain Vulture. The regulars you will be happy to see are Robert Downey Jr as Stark, Marisa Tomei as Aunt May and Jon Favreau as Happy Hogan. Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts has a cameo appearance at the end and even favours the screen with a kiss with Stark. Mandatory at the high-school story are clowning sidekick Ned played by Jacob Batalon and love interest Liz played by Laura Harrier.<br/><br/>Finally, the 3D in the screening I saw was the best I've seen so far. Two set pieces, among several, are well crafted: the Monument and Stanton Island Ferry."

When watching any movie I begin by awarding the film 10/10 and subtract marks & add marks accordingly as the film progresses. Why? Because I'm a positive kind of guy. You're innocent until proven guilty, honest until proven dishonest. 
I've seen 1000s of movies. Those I have predicted will be classics (Shawshank Redemption 1994) are now at No1 on the IMDB data base & in many movie critics top 10. Fast forward 24 years to today. 
This is honestly the first time I've ever watched a promising film with great actors and actresses (Tyne Daly (Cagney & Lacey) Michael Keaton, Robert Downey Jr) deteriorate from a 10/10 to a 1/10 in literally 12 minutes. When a film hits that low I quit. You've wasted my money. You will not waste my time. It's irredeemable. <br/><br/>Every time I subtracted a mark I thought, ""It's okay. I could edit this film. I could fix that. But then there would be another problem. Followed by another. And another until I thought, Okay. Let's ignore all that and imagine the film started from 7 minutes in. It continued to get worse until if flatlined at 1/10 by the 11th minute and I shut it down. Now I know what people are going to say. But what about the action etc that comes later? That's like expecting me to eat shxt just because there's desert afterwards. Sorry. I'm out. The film has ruined my appetite & there's an overwhelming stench coming from the directors kitchen."

","Its a good film. Not very original as I felt I was watching a new version of ""Kick-Ass"" but it had some really great aspects. The action scenes were wonderfully put in scene. The story approach is indeed like John Hughes would have shot a super hero film which worked perfectly for me in regards of a ""Spider-Man"" film because this was something I missed about all the previous films - the coming of age factor. Tom Holland was perfectly cast. There is no doubt. He IS Peter Parker and he IS Spider-Man with the right among of youth naivety. Great performance and absolutely convincing. Also the choice of Michael Keaton as Vutlure was not only a pitch perfect ironic casting choice but also the absolute right one because he took that role really seriously and delivered a wonderful performance. Really menacing in many aspects and it was role you could have easily overacted. The weakest point of the cast for me was Laura Harrier who wasn't particularly bad but just very boring. Marisa Tomei was a bit wasted and it was a positive surprise that they really kept Robert Downey Jr's appearance short - don't get me wrong I love him and his Tony Stark but he left to spotlight to Holland and Spider-Man which was the right thing after ""Captain America: Civil War"" felt more like an Iron Man film than a ""Captain America"" film. Why Gwyneth Paltrow tho received such a high billing for her cameo will ever be a huge mystery to me, same goes to Zendaya who had more like a side kick part, but at least she was fun. Really loved Jon Favreau and good to see Danny Glover. The soundtrack worked perfectly and the screenplay had some fun dialogues and nice surprises. Great entertainment"

But Peter gets his chance to prove himself when righteous salvager Adrian Toomes (Michael Keaton) the winged Vulture beings smuggling extra-terrestrial advanced weaponry, and its down to the wall crawler to take him down.<br/><br/>The journey of Spider-Man has been a long one from the camp 70s TV series, Toby Maguire's perfect Peter Parker, just not so much Spider-Man, to Andrew Garfield not so perfect Peter Parker, to excellent Spider-Man. Now thanks to Marvel and Sony's new agreement we are blessed with the sensational presence of Tom Holland. Since he wowed us with his brief appearance in Civil War, fans have not slept till we saw his own flick, and how much does this man deliver. Although still not bang on the precise age of Spider-Man Tom Holland does amazingly capture the exciting teenager character of Spider-Man, a much more realistic and enjoyable screen presence, something that Magurie and Garfield could never bring.<br/><br/>With spot on directing by Jon Watts Homecoming wonderfully explores the real life troubles of Spider-Man, especially at the early stages of hero-ing he is. With great focus and detail to Parker's teen life with a great mixture of a thrilling plot and well establish villain (something that the MCU does struggle with, just not today). This is brought to life the rest of the supporting cast, such as Keaton, who demonstrates a who new Birdman since his last costume role. Furthermore Parker's best friend Ned (Jacob Batalon) proving significant contribution to the laugh factor. Robert Downy Jr also popping once or twice to play the role he must certainly nail in his sleep, Tony Stark/Iron Man. This was also a relief as Iron Man's appearance is perfectly distributed in a low key tone not once stealing the thunder of Holland.<br/><br/>One thing that the MCU does seem to do well in is the laughs, and with a wonderfully witty character like Spider-Man there is much loud laughs to be had. Not just brought by Holland but the majority of the cast. One slight resentment is that there may so many jokes that could convince yourself your in an all out comedy movie, but when the action and drama starts, it becomes an intense roller-coaster.<br/><br/>It may seem that this just another spider man film (in 3 years) but the MCU creates more space for all heroes in their own worlds. So when we enter Spider-Man's world we can have a fun and energetic perspective of the world of super-heroes. This of course comes form Tom Hollands performance. There is great national pride to be taken since we have had two British Spider-Mans in a row.<br/><br/>Spider-Man Homecoming is a magnificent exhilarating experience unique on its own for the MCU, with a flawless performance by the worlds perfect Spider-Man Tom Holland.

How can Marvel get their own characters so wrong. <br/><br/>Zendaya: Her I'm sooooo cool, but look I don't care attitude became so old so fast, that every time she showed up on screen I instantly became disinterested in anything that was happening on screen. Another example of trying to fit a square peg into a round hole, another total miscast by Marvel. Please someone get this woman acting lessons before the next film. <br/><br/>SJW: When asked about the Washington monument Zendaya replies: I don't want to see something built by slaves....again WHY, why put this into a spider-man movie?<br/><br/>super spider suit: The suit Tony Stark gives spider man was so distracting and annoying because for half the movie I thought I was watching Iron Man in a spider-man suit. Spidey should only have his web shooters and quick wit when he goes into battle. <br/><br/>Powers: How can marvel get spider man powers this wrong? Peter can't stick to a plane, or a building. why? and where, where is spider mans spider sense? <br/><br/>Uncle Ben: I've read Spider man comics since the 70's and the driving force behind spider man being a hero comes from the death of his Uncle Ben, but now Peter only cares about pleasing Tony Stark and becoming an avenger. I'm sorry but you can't replace Uncle Ben with Tony Stark. with great power comes great responsibility, Tony Stark would never utter those words. <br/><br/>
 it was a hard film to watch and even harder to watch if you are a true Spider-man fan. 3/10 I never thought I would say that the DC movie Wonder Woman was a far better film than this abomination."
"Ramascreen","8","17","44","29 June 2017"," Iron Spider: Homecoming
","So here's my review of Iron Spider Homecoming.. ehm.. I meant to say #SpiderManHomecoming. It's an incredibly fun teen movie but it's not perfect. I think Tom Holland is a great Peter Parker, he's got the character down spot on. No offense to Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield but Tom Holland's version is like straight out of the pages. But with this reboot, they basically plaster Iron Man's previous drama on to Spider-Man in addition to the new tech-based suit, so I'm not sure if that's going to sit well with all the fans.<br/><br/>The events take place right after the colossal airport fight in ""Captain America: Civil War,"" young Peter Parker/Spider-Man (Tom Holland) is stoked about helping Iron Man and looking forward to the next mission. But he seems to have been sidelined by his new mentor, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) Peter goes about his high school life with his best friend and decathlon classmates, when Vulture (Michael Keaton) emerges as the new villain.<br/><br/>There's a bit of John Hughes influence in ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" and that's a good thing considering Hughes was a legend when it comes to chronicling high school dramas, so it's natural for any filmmaker that's handling the same subject to be taking inspiration from his movies. I think Holland's fellow young co-stars are just as perfect in their roles. And Michael Keaton is superb. The movie doesn't have to keep hammering the whole working class man getting screwed over by the rich and powerful because Keaton himself already does a good job of conveying that. I enjoy the vibrancy of the chases because the movie keeps reminding us that Spider-Man can't go immediately from one location to another so Spider-Man has to hitch a ride or trespass a backyard or crashes a sleepover tent.<br/><br/>But because the humor really works, the drama has to come from somewhere else. They remove the origin story involving Uncle Ben and they also remove the ""With great power comes great responsibility"" essence, and they replace those with the dilemmas that Tony Stark had to experience in his previous film which asked the question of can a superhero be a superhero without his suit. To some, this might make sense so as to give us Spidey stripped down to his element. While others might see it as an effort to include Spidey in the MCU that comes with the risk of turning our friendly neighborhood hero into something else. The tech-based suit does provide some of the film's hilarious moments, but at times it makes Peter Parker/Spidey even more bumbling than he should be. So I'm not suggesting that iron-manizing Spider- Man is a terrible idea but clearly there are just too many MCU fingerprints all over what's supposed to be a Spider-Man new solo movie. The classic song might as well go like this ""Spider-Man, Spider-Man, does whatever Iron Man can.""<br/><br/>-- Rama's Screen --"

Although I thought Tom Holland was a good Spidey he's actually 21 NOT 15, why not get an actual teenager to play PP instead of adult actors having to play kids!! The story and writing were very weak and in general I found the whole film to be rather boring, predictable, irritatingly noisy with the usual set-ups and a less than threatening villain, also PP lives in the most ethnically diverse world ever!! this felt rather forced and fake to me. My problem with these heavily CG films is that you are not actually watching REAL people so therefore there isn't any feel of dread for the characters on screen, who cares if a CG teenager dressed as a spider is being chased by a CG old man dressed as a vulture!! I realise I am not the target audience for this type of film but at the end of the day ""a good film is a good film"" regardless of the age group it's aimed at. I'm sure early teen boys will find it ""awesome"" but it left me rather cold and underwhelmed. Definitely not worthy of all the hype."

Michael Keaton is as reliable as he always Is. Robert Downey Jr is not given as much to do, as the trailer suggests he does, but he is as great as he always is. Zendaya stands out in a small role, that looks like it will be expanded in the next movie. Marisa Tomei (an actress I always enjoy seeing on screen) is the hottest Aunt May you will ever see. Jon Favareau is fine as happy, Gwyneth Paltrow also pops up for a cameo at the end too.<br/><br/>I look forward to the next one."
"MLDinTN","4","4","7","10 March 2018"," why did marvel just forget about the comics?
","In this version of spiderman, it's like marvel just said screw the comics. We'll just make up a bunch of stuff. There is no Uncle Ben, and Aunt May is way to young. Peter isn't into photography. And where does Iron Man fit into a Spiderman movie. Also, since this movie is like a reboot with Peter back in high school and only 15, I would have liked to see the movie show how Peter developed his powers. The movie could have had Peter tell Ned the story of how he got spider powers in flashbacks. The story just pales in comparrison to the first Spiderman movie. I did like the Vultures costume and special effects with him. But Spiderman's suit is all gadetted out and I didn't think that ever happened.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Not that great compared to some of the other Spidey films. The best part about the film was the jokes."

","This movie is not perfect, though it did get almost everything right about Spidey in the comics. I did say almost though. The new addition of Karen the computer a.i was good, I hear people complaining about how it was not comic accurate and I believe it was a good way of us (the viewers) to get inside his head without him always talking to himself.<br/><br/>This movie did something that the others could not achieve; getting the life of Peter Parker right. The first franchise almost didn't get into school and balancing life, just came to Parker when they wanted a compelling love story. The Mark Webb trilogy just had this cool, handsome guy that just didn't feel like Peter. This film has a perfect actor (Tom Holland) who looks the age of Peter Parker, he acts all nervous and quirky and talks like a nerdy teenager who is new at this super stuff.<br/><br/>The actions nice and smooth. Spidey is not very good at superheroing and that feels just right in the way Tom Holland acts it out. The villain is intimidating and has one scene in the car which you see in the trailer that is just sensational. It is a hilarious movie that had me laughing like 90% of the film. And Iron Man does not take over the movie at all he is barely in it, so don't worry about that."
"thisseatofmars","5","7","15","11 July 2017"," The best Spiderman movie since the Maguire movie-- but with some criticisms.
","This is the best Spiderman movie since the original with Tobey Maguire back in the early 2000's (God do I feel old.) It has the right balance of action, melodrama and romance. That's where the Andrew Garfield Spiderman movies failed, I think: the balance was way, way off. We had much too much of Peter Parking mooning over Gwen Stacey and not enough Spiderman, Electro, and Lizard in those: and it's a shame we won't have a sequel to Garfield's Spiderman, because the third movie looked like they were building to the Sinister Six.<br/><br/>Spiderman is better than all the other Marvel and X-Men movies because it doesn't take itself too seriously and does not fall completely in the mould that every single other Marvel movie falls into: Thor is dumb and dry, Antman is dumb and dry, Captain America, Holy Cheese, don't get me started: are those movies ever dumb, dry, and forgettable.<br/><br/>Spiderman, on the other hand, has vibrancy. New York, the people of New York, the characters and even most of the jokes are all as colourful as Spiderman's red and blue suit. The young man playing Spiderman deserves praise, as does his chubby friend, as does Marissa Tomei, but especially Micheal Keaton. I really liked Keaton in this: Keaton is a powerhouse actor and I really hope to see more of him in this role as the Vulture.<br/><br/>Some criticisms, though. First, there's a line where a student says to a teacher that he's been attending protests, to which the teacher says, ""That's good, you're a good American, attending protests."" While this is true (protests helped end the war in Vietnam) the only protests in the news lately have been the Antifa protests, the Black Lives Matter protests, and Anti-Trump protests: and the first two stem from the third. BLM is nothing like the Selma to Montgomery marches and has been criticized endlessly: MLK, a wonderful, peaceful leader, protested by praying in public while wearing his church clothes. The protesters of BLM meanwhile dress in masks and gang clothing and have engaged in looting and destruction. Plus the less said about Antifa (look up ""students larping as revolutionaries"" and people like Eric Clanton at Berkeley) the better.<br/><br/>Another criticism: there's a scene where the students go to the Washington Monument and one student, Michelle (who is dark-skinned), refuses to enter, saying that she won't go into a building built by slaves. Her teacher, a white man, tells her that, ""Oh, I'm pretty sure the monument wasn't built by slaves,"" to which a security guard (also dark-skinned) looks at him and makes a gesture that says, ""Eh, maybe, dude: and be careful."" Then we see the teacher become flustered and then literally back away from the two.<br/><br/>A few things about this. Why are the white people in this movie either villains (Vulture) or ignorant clowns (the teacher)? The actors playing Captain American and Iron Man are both present as cameos, but all the other white people are villains or idiots (Spiderman is part Italian, by the way). While slavery is a horrible blotch on American history, I don't think that denigrating another race is any way to make up for it. Additionally, the idea that the Washington Monument was built by slaves is dubious (John Steele Gordon, author of ""Washington's Monument and the Fascinating History of the Obelisk"" doubts the monument was built by slaves), so, if the history is dubious, why even bring it up? If the history behind it is dubious but we have a blockbuster movie claiming it's fact, then millions of moviegoers will leave thinking it's fact: just as we've had news reports claiming that Trump, during his first days in office, removed a bust of MLK, which turned out to be a lie. But most people now think it's true because it was in the news for a week.<br/><br/>Hey: America's problem isn't racism, but classism. You know leftist propaganda has you when you're paying money to go to the movies and hear lines like these."

","Won't bother you with spoilers or anything like that. I used to be a huge Spidey fan. Grew up watching the cartoons and reading the comics. This version has nothing, and I repeat, nothing to do with Spider-Man. It's a washed down hi-tech version made to appeal to tweens and also to the guilt of the millennials. <br/><br/>Too much PC-washing (it's like whitewashing but opposite). And the acting didn't help. Peter Parker comes out as an obnoxious and annoying teen who is infatuated with himself (mostly) and has total disregard of the consequences some of his actions might have. <br/><br/>The only upside of the movie was Michael Keaton who did an outstanding job portraying Adrian Toomes. <br/><br/>All in all, this is a blatant attempt at converting Spider-Man into a politically correct moronic teen so that they can rip some more money out of people's pockets."

","Following his unofficial ""tryouts"" in Germany, Peter Parker returns to his home in Queens trying--albeit not very well--to balance his responsibilities as a high school overachiever with the added dangers of being a crime-fighting superhero. When a new and well-equipped criminal enterprise emerges in New York City, Peter naturally wants to try and end the threat, but quickly gets in over his head--much to the chagrin of reluctant mentor Tony Stark. Despite being the sixth go-round, this is a surprisingly refreshing take on the titular character--wisely sidestepping the origin tale formula--and presenting a unique story with a lighthearted tone, coming-of-age themes, and just enough twists and references to weave it within the greater framework of the burgeoning MCU. Holland is wonderful, bringing a youthful ambition and naivet√© that hasn't been seen in previous incarnations of the character, while veteran Keaton is a chilling antagonist. Some of the supporting characters are underused, but this is a nice job overall. ***"

"Troy_Campbell","8","6","13","7 July 2017"," Breezy fun with spectacular set pieces.
","With this iteration of the web-slinger arriving hot on the heels of the Andrew Garfield Amazing Spider-Man movies, it needed to justify its existence by bringing something fresh to the table. It does. As soon as Peter Parker (Tom Holland) is introduced through a series of his own video blogs, taking us behind the scenes during a key battle in Captain America: Civil War, it's clear this will be the funniest and most playful cinematic version of Spidey yet. Chockfull of irreverent humour, borderline adult gags and Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) injects, but also enough angst befitting a 15-year-old protagonist, director Jon Watts keeps the tone lightweight but edgy. Soon-to-be-megastar Holland is crucial to this tone, nailing the balance between ignorant enthusiasm, geeky charm and‚Äîcoming with the adolescent territory‚Äîworld-on-his-shoulders seriousness. When this Spider-Man makes mistakes you can't help but like him even more. And when his lapses in judgment lead to epic action set pieces, who can complain? The most memorable is a vertigo-inducing thriller set in, around and atop the Washington Monument; with both this and the gigantic ferry sequence showcasing Watts' talent for crafting big budget awe ‚Äì expect to see him around a lot more in Hollywood. Of course this new Spidey requires its own take on all the usual elements, so we get a much younger and hipper Aunt May (Marisa Tomei), a more awkward and complicated romance (with Laura Harrier's Liza Allan), and a Stark-built suit with an amusing female-voiced interface. For the most part the new and/or improved ingredients work well (Jacob Batalon and Zendaya also make for a sweetly goofy best friend and a hilariously snarky loner respectively), however, Homecoming is not perfect. Michael Keaton's villainous Vulture isn't as threatening as he could've been, Tony Revolori's Flash Thompson is boring and clich√©d, and there are sporadic bouts of distractingly shimmery CGI, particularly with shots that are entirely computer generated. By and large though this latest addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe is a breezy delight with spectacular set pieces and winning humour. If there was any doubt before it has now been expelled: Spidey is in safe hands at Marvel."

"rgkarim","8","6","13","7 July 2017"," Web Slinging, Comedic Sensation: Feels Much Like the Comic Book
","He can do whatever a spider can! He is super brainy and has the ability to fight crime against a number of villains with interesting powers. And he has had two reboots in the last two decades. Yes, I'm talking about Spiderman, the young high school student who wears the coolest pajamas ever and has some pretty wicked powers. This weekend, Disney studios gets their hands on the series, in hopes of breathing life back into the series and expanding their already vast repertoire of films. Can Disney repeat its magic? Robbie K here to give you the updates, and as always, I appreciate your reading and fun. Let's get started!<br/><br/>LIKES:<br/><br/>Not another origin story: With all the reboots, cartoon series, and comics (if you still read), we know how the web slinger obtained his powers via radioactive arachnid science projects. As such, the storyboard writers decided to scrap doing another reboot of this and dived right into the fun at hand. Thank the lord! Spiderman homecoming skips the boring, lacking power component, so that you get the most bang for your buck in regards to super power heroics and Spiderman clich√©s. The presentation of this film is rather creative, using a selfie video to give a unique perspective on everything this Spiderman has gone through so far. <br/><br/>Fun and Funny: Spiderman Homecoming takes a different approach from most of the other superhero films in that it feels like a high school student life only with¬Öpowers. The result is a film that is fun, simplistic, and as me and my friend agree comedic. This tale is all about making you laugh with a fantastic dialog, great delivery, and a cast that only amplifies it. It's not easy making a high school film that isn't an afterschool special, drama filled, soap opera and still make it entertaining to watch. But Disney was able to do it again. While the production team has a lot to do with this, most audience members are going to give props to the acting. Tom Holland again rocks the role, taking his cameo from Civil War and running¬Ö I mean slinging with it. He is the first actor in this modern age to capture both the nerdy peter parker and the smart mouthed Spiderman, giving you the character you wanted made for some time. Now throw in Michael Keaton portraying a villain who didn't make you cringe, yawn, or sympathize for the performance they were asked to play. The dynamic between them works and to take a lamer villain like the Vulture and make him respectable gets thumbs up from me. And they utilized their entire cast very well, keeping their big-name contenders involved without robbing the main actor his time to shine. <br/><br/>Ned: But my friend and I agreed that the best part of the film was Peter's sidekick Ned played by Jacob Batalon. This character had me in enough stitches to require Spiderman to web it up. Batalon delivers his lines perfectly, and makes the already comedic gold shine where others would fail. He feels like a devoted fan boy and it works to keep things entertaining. The cast did a great job sharing Peter's secret with him and having him as the devoted friend wanting to do whatever he can to live as a super sidekick. This character's work is dynamic, it's fun, and shows not all cleverness has been lost to cheap slapstick ploys. <br/><br/>DISLIKES:<br/><br/>Special effects are so so: I don't know if it's the costume, the approach, or what, but the special effects didn't impress me as much as they usually do. Spiderman's movements looked fake at times, and the weapons (outside of Vulture's costume) were a bit hokie looking. Not the biggest dislike, but worth noting. <br/><br/>Editing/Lack of Action: Biggest dislike for me is more so the lack of action. No surprise, Robbie wants his superheroes to have at least one engaging fight, but that wasn't the case for me in this film. While Homecoming was funny and entertaining, it still lacked the bite that superhero films have had. The fights were short lived, didn't involve too many spectacular moves, and the villains didn't have any impressive moves. We know Spidey's universe have some of the most unique powers of the bunch, so why in the world didn't they show that off more. Of note, the battles do keep in theme with the movie, and are emotional in regards to character development, that is a plus. Yet a 134-minute run time needed a few more suspenseful moments to get the full effect. Either that or cut out the extra laugh, unnecessary moments to shorten the run time. Sorry guys, but editing is still in need of work. <br/><br/>The VERDICT:<br/><br/>Spiderman Homecoming is certainly one of the better installments of the modern Spiderman age. It certainly is one of the more enjoyable comedies I've seen in a while, and takes some of the darker edge that has been building over the last few installments. A great use of cast, good writing, and many other fun gimmicks works on so many levels and will entertain many. Yet it isn't the most exciting film of this universe, nor did it need to be over 2 hours long. Still, it's a great addition to the library and one I look forward to seeing continued and integrated into the rest of the films. Worth a trip to the theater? Oh yeah (as if I can stop you), it is worth it. <br/><br/>My scores: Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi: 8.0 Movie Overall: 7.5"

","I thought that this movie was great! In my view, Tom Holland was easily the best Spider-Man marvel have had so far. Personally, it's my favourite out of the Spider-Man films marvel have made. <br/><br/>I thought the story line was great and Tom Holland was a convincible character and you could believe that he was a teenager, rather than some of the other Spider-Man's that didn't necessarily look the part as they looked older than what they were supposed to be. Definitely, some of the other Spider-Man's played were amazing. Let's take Toby Maguire for example. He was flawless but in my eyes, so was Tom Holland. <br/><br/>The story line was advanced and well thought out. It was very funny and comical. In most of the Spider-Man movies, they didn't really advance on the fact that they were high school students. Spider-Man homecoming did show how Spider-Man was leading a double life and how it was difficult to keep his identity a secret. <br/><br/>I think overall this movie was my favourite Spider-Man movie yet. I did expect a lot of it and it definitely didn't let me down. I don't think marvel would ever miss an opportunity to impress us and they did it again with Spider-Man homecoming. If you haven't seen it already, I suggest watching it. It's something I rushed to watch again and no matter how many times I watched it, there was nothing that let me down! <br/><br/>Great movie!"

","Oh, and to also make a damn decent iteration of Spiderman for the big screen. Was never a fan of the Raimi trilogy, Tobey Maguire didn't work for me. Andrew Garfield was great but the films ultimately didn't deliver. Now that Marvel acquired him, we finally have a great iteration. Not perfect, but pretty damn great. Smart moves were made that I do applaud. Not rehashing the origin story for a third time was THE move that was important. This is post Civil War, and the studio knew how intelligent their audiences were...obviously being the fact we didn't want to see another 30 minutes of Peter getting bitten and discovering his abilities in bewilderment. Second smart move was to use Tony Stark as the father figure as opposed to Uncle Ben (again!), thankfully Iron Man was kept to a minimum but the endearment and protection that Stark has for Parker was a much needed attribute to the plot in order to keep it grounded. That is exactly what this film does best, it remains low-key even in terms of our villain's motives (which I must say were rather bland). Final smart move, obtaining the perfect cast. Oh yes this cast was so tidy! Tom Holland, in a career defining role, aced it. Finally we have a younger Spiderman and his portrayal was the most accurate representation of the comic book superhero so far. Michael Keaton looks like he was enjoying his role as the psychopath Vulture, although for the film to describe him as a psychopath is hyperbolic. More bitter perhaps? The rest of the cast were charismatic and were able to execute their lines to comedic perfection. The script is rather witty which definitely enhances the comic book feel that the film was going for. It's part superhero blockbuster and a coming-of-age comedy and switches between the two frequently, my problem is they didn't mix well and it felt like watching two separate films. I was more interested in Peter Parker's school life than his super heroic antics. Still, a consistently good entry for the MCU!"

","Admittedly, I liked Tom Holland as Spider-Man. I thought that Toby Maguire was always too over-the-top nerdy. Andrew Garfield was ok also. The rest of the movie was mostly a train wreck.<br/><br/>I'm a big MCU fan and was nervous when Disney took over. After watching this disaster, seems like my fears are realized. The casting was downright awful. Michael Keaton was not really convincing as villain. And the obvious political agenda is sickening with the casting of Ned, Flash, Michelle (supposedly MJ??) and Liz. And what is with the sultry Aunt Mae??? Which comic book episode is that from???<br/><br/>And the story? So many holes. It's convenient that Stark and Hogan are never truly available to help until the plot has been resolved in predictable fashion. Except for the horrible boat scene where Iron Man inexplicably makes an appearance to save the day but leaves as quickly as he arrives. Really? Don't care to know how a boat of that size was sliced in half? What about the passengers - not terribly concerned to make sure folks are ok? I have always questioned how the current MCU relationship among the Avengers would factor into the single-hero movies and it looks like Disney is indeed butchering those plots.<br/><br/>The whole alien cleanup plot is a mess also. So these alien artifacts were just entrusted to a random cleanup crew to dispose of? And how did Keaton earn income for so long working underground? He must have sold a lot of weapons to maintain his living situation so where are all of those weapons?<br/><br/>And why do so many characters know that Peter is Spider-Man already? And where is Gwen? Why isn't Peter a photographer? What about Uncle Ben?<br/><br/>This was a detriment to the Spider-Man legacy. No backstory, a mess of a plot, terrible casting. A complete failure all around. Worst MCU movie to date."
"WooderIce64","8","3","5","23 February 2018"," Good, but very different
","Spider-Man has quite a wild ride on the big screen, hasn't he? Sam Raimi's Spider-Man movies are a solid trilogy, but Sony's are rather forgettable. But with two sets of Spider-Man movies behind us, it's hard to not look back, especially on the Raimi trilogy, when thinking about Homecoming as a movie. That's important to bring up because Homecoming drastically differs from the previous Spider-Man films. While that's not necessarily a bad thing, it does mean that something just feels wrong about this movie. Maybe it's because the Daily Bugle's not in in. Maybe it's because Mary Jane isn't in it either. Maybe it's that Spidey's suit has all the different powers and weapons that makes him feel more like Iron Man. But something just feels off about it. It is still a very good movie, and possibly Marvel's funniest to date. Even if he was introduced in Civil War, there's no denying it. Tom Holland is the best Spider-Man. He acts and looks like he's 15, unlike Maguire and Garfield, who were clearly way older than the character they portrayed. Without giving anything away, the climax and ending were absolutely spectacular, both on a visual scale, and the way the character development sorts out. The other characters were good as well. Vulture was one of the best comic book movie villains ever. What's great about him is that you could make the legitimate argument that he's not actually a villain. He's not out to kill Spider-Man or something like that. He's just doing what everyone wants to do - get rich and live an easy life. He doesn't even cause that much damage, making him much more human than other villains. As for the other characters, well... Controversial opinion: Zendaya wasn't funny in this movie, she was annoying. She's a good actress, I know she's a fan favorite, but the whole movie she was trying way too hard to be edgy. It wasn't funny at all. Ned was pretty funny, though. He fills in Harry Osborn's role quite well. Liz wasn't exactly the most memorable character, but she had some good scenes, so she's fine. It really did feel like she was filling in for Mary Jane. You do gotta feel bad for her at the end. Iron Man is in this movie, but he's kind of like a father figure to Spidey here, and it works. <br/><br/>All in all, I think I'm personally blinded by nostalgia for the Sam Raimi trilogy to appreciate Homecoming for what it is. I know that the aspect of Spider-Man having become famous through YouTube in this version negates the purpose of the Daily Bugle, but that just leaves a void in the film. It doesn't feel like a Spider-Man movie. And while that's not necessarily a bad thing, it just makes it hard for me to enjoy Homecoming as much as others did. It's a worthy addition to the MCU, and that's what it is. MCU Spider-Man. What we've wanted for so long.<br/><br/>Personal aside: my brother saw this movie before I did because I was stuck in the New Jersey Pine Barrens, and he successfully tricked me into thinking that the post-credits scene was super important. I had to go to the bathroom so bad by the end of the movie, but I absolutely had to wait for the post-credits scene. I couldn't miss it. And if you know what it is... yeah. I got fooled big time."
"Pjtaylor-96-138044","8","3","5","14 February 2018"," It's a really fun time when it gets going; the best Spider-Man film since Sam Raimi's second instalment.
","Surprisingly (or maybe not so for anyone who's confidence in the steadily declining quality-control centre over at Sony hasn't been shaken as much as mine), it's the best Spider-Man film since Sam Raimi's second instalment. Though it's a clear step down from the first two films of that trilogy, it thankfully gives us something we haven't already seen. By skipping the origin and giving us a younger (finally, an actor who isn't nearly thirty) Peter Parker who's less experienced as a web-slinger than ever before, it creates a uniquely engaging story and a refreshing change of pace. This time around, the web-head's powers are neutered slightly in favour of a more tech-heavy suit, but the feature also manages to fit his abilities in with his characteristics comfortably - he certainly seems like the same person in and out of the suit - and his movement constantly reflects both his physique and his personality. The villain is a three-dimensional character who feels like a human being with proper motivations and valid emotions while still being menacing. He's the best villain in the series since Doc Ock. There are a number of exciting set-pieces that focus on a lower-stakes kind of spectacle that not only makes narrative sense but feels fresh. The best sequence in the film involves the hero and villain sans suits simply having a cleverly conceived conversation. The feature manages to balance the school stuff with the web-swinging so that the former never encroaches on the latter but also has enough time to feel like it matters. Overall, it's a really fun time when it gets going and is a fine return to form for the web-head. 8/10"
"mysterioso-66097","8","3","5","13 October 2017"," Very entertaining, much smaller scale than other Marvel Movies
","Spider-Man Homecoming; yet another Marvel movie in the MCU, and yet another success. This movie is a bit refreshing in that it's a much smaller-scale conflict. The focus is primarily on Peter Parker as a character and less on Spider-Man as a superhero, but there's still plenty of Spider-Man action. They made a Spider-Man origin story without the same origin clich√©s of ""With great power comes great responsibility"" and without showing the Peter getting bitten by a Spider scene, which I appreciate. The movie has a serviceable plot, with engaging characters and a villain that's at least better than most of Marvel's other villains. While many people complain that they ""ruined Spider-Man"" because he's not the same as he is in the comics, I would like to remind people that he's actually MORE accurate to the comics than in other adaptations, since he's a teenager and still has his powers. While he does use a tech suit, the movie does a great job of showing that Spider-Man is more than just the suit. Technically, the movie is great as usual, with very good sound design, visuals, and editing.<br/><br/>As for the negatives, the action isn't really the best, especially after the impeccably choreographed Winter Soldier and Civil War, and the visually stunning Doctor Strange. The music is forgettable, as it is in most Marvel movies. But all in all, not many complaints from me. I saw it and was greatly entertained by it, and hey, that's all you really want when you watch a Spider-Man movie."

What do you think of that? I think nothing happens accidentally... OK, Michael Keaton and Robert Downey Jr. are two excellent actors. One more talented than the other. Robert Downey Jr. is perhaps the most versatile actor, he can play anything. Michael Keaton is also anointed with all the ointments. But money is the devil's eye, and without money you can not live.

"kamenhaven","3","11","30","29 July 2017"," The Marvel-fication of Spider-Man takes a turn for the worst
","This movie is confusing, baffling and outright offensive for a number of reasons. For one, this is a Spider-Man movie that gets its titular character totally wrong. Since when did Spider-Man, the most popular Marvel character who is not only completely capable of holding his own beside some of the most iconic superheroes in the Marvel stable but besting them numerous times over, has to seek any kind of validation or approval from Tony Stark (aka Iron Man) ever? Since when did everything cool about Spidey is attributed to this MCU figure? What happened to the grounded, relatable kid whose primary concerns should be about getting good grades, acquiring a job, paying rent and providing for his aunt? Or the absence of a relative who is the sole motivating factor to Spider-Man becoming who he is? None of these are present or feel like they exist, and these are all crucial touchstones of the Spider-Man story.<br/><br/>Other negative points: At 133 mins, this movie is wayyyyy too long. The great Marisa Tomei as Aunt May, is completely wasted and woefully underused. Michael Keaton was great, but his transition to villain feels sped-up. Filmmakers tried to reference John Hughes, but the final product bears nothing but an insult to John Hughes. Characters in John Hughes movies were memorable & the humour was funny, none of which were found in this movie. Terrible action sequences, both in execution and story. Homecoming suggests Spider-Man is clumsy, inexperienced and in over his head when he's saving people. Which is so not true bcoz Spider-Man is one of the most agile, intelligent and fast-thinking superheroes in the Marvel universe. But he's only 15! Sure. But does it make sense when you think about the fact that he already went toe-to-toe with Cap, Ant-Man, Falcon and Bucky in Civil War?<br/><br/>The Sam Raimi Spider-Man films remain the superior adaptations of this character. That trilogy of films felt like it was about something important. Spider-Man: Homecoming is about nothing. I learn nothing and felt nothing. There was nothing that enriched my understanding of the character, in fact it lessened my appreciation for him. It's a shame bcoz I actually liked Tom Holland and was impressed by his scene-stealing cameo in Civil War."
"tristanian","3","11","30","29 July 2017"," What's wrong with MCU
","This movie has nothing to do with Spider-Man... it's Ironman lectures iron-boy. The movie IMMEDIATELY jumps the shark by showing hand-cam footage allegedly filmed by Parker himself during the infamous airport fight scene from Civil War. Peter is really excited to potentially murder captain America, and shows how this new stranger named Peter will fight for anyone that buys him gifts and speaks sweet words in his ear. After nearly killing America's hero, captain America, and causing untold damage, whether physical or political relations between nations, in Europe, the film skips foreword to the current day. Be advised once again, everything you knew or liked about Spider-Man IS DEAD, along with uncle Ben. Aunt may must have really moved on after he died, because Ben is never mentioned and the non stop jokes between aunt may and peter never stop. Iron man and his ""butler"" show up more than any other side character in the film. This movie is everything wrong wi the MCU. To put put a final cherry on this Blank sandwich, the AI in spidys suit NEVER SHUTS UP. I would rather watch amazing spider man 2 and Spider-Man 3 than this. At one point during a boat rescue, a man actually stands up and starts cheering on IRON MAN, who saves spicy from a failed heroic act. At this point I was thinking, if this guy doesn't care about the new Spider-Man, why should I?"
"MichaelNontonMulu","8","7","17","5 July 2017"," Started Off as Light Teen Movie, but Ended with A More Complex Storyline
","Well, this was a movie that I was actually feeling a bit weird to see at first. Reason being it was the 6th Spider-Man movie done in the past 15 years and Tom Holland was the 3rd person portraying the superhero. I was earlier hoping for a 3rd Spider-Man movie with Andrew Garfield since the 2nd one left with a rather disturbing cliffhanger. But with the recast and the inclusion of Spider-Man into Marvel Cinematic Universe, that hope vaporized already. So even though a Marvel movie was generally highly anticipated, my excitement towards the movie was a bit mixed in the beginning. However, after finished seeing the movie, I felt that Sony pictures was correct in their decision to join up with Marvel Studios as this movie was fantastic.<br/><br/>The earlier part of the movie was a bit too light for me as I felt it was a really teenage movie with high school problems. But as it continued on, the movie became heavier and more complex, especially with the challenges that Peter faced with his wish to be taken seriously by Tony Stark, and also his dilemma between high school education and the life of a superhero. Being a kid of 15 year old with only his aunt certainly did not help (Yes, this Spider-Man is really just a kid!).<br/><br/>Now aside from the story which I think was excellent from the middle onwards, I felt that there was too little screen time of Aunt May (seemed like she was not a supporting role but just a minor role and was unclear of her role in Peter's life other than just being there few times). This movie was not like any other origin story of Spider-Man with the showing of how he was bitten or how Peter became a Spider-Man and there was not even a flash back to show that. I guess the writers thought it was enough shown anyway in other adaptations.<br/><br/>This movie was very good in term of its special effects and action sequence. I felt it was done fantastically during at least 3 different major fighting scenes involving Spider-Man. Its sound effects were also nice (though it was strangely not made in Dolby Atmos or Auro 11.1 system). The major surprise in the last third of the movie was good and also a bit of nice surprise before the end. As usual Marvel movies, this one had got post credit scene. One in the middle and another funny one at the very end that you should not miss out.<br/><br/>For a movie with just a little over 2 hours, surprisingly it had quite significant story line and quite a lot were told, though as I said the beginning was very light. One major thing that I felt was good was the amount of screen time for Iron Man was not too much. Otherwise it would not be a Spider-Man movie but a Spider-Man & Iron Man movie. He was shown only occasionally which was just enough since Robert Downey Jr. had such a major on screen appearance and would take the spotlight off Tom Holland who I think was pretty good in portraying a very young Spider-Man.<br/><br/>So if you are a fan of Marvel movies, this one would not disappoint you. If you are one of those audience who felt there was too many superheroes movies in the past few years, you should still try and see this one as I believe it would be worth the while. For family and young children, this movie would be quite entertaining and as what I saw in the internet, the ratings for the movie was very high and it would most likely go on as a major hit again for Disney/Marvel studios. <br/><br/>For my complete review, pls have a look at michaelnontonmulu.blogspot.co.id"

","Someone reviewing another movie recently wrote 'Every One Star or Ten Star is a lie' ‚Äì don't believe them ‚Äì I gave this one star (because you can't give zero), and I'm a genuine poster making a genuine review. The reason quite simply, is that it is not a Spider-Man movie, - if they had changed the costume and given it the title 'Adopted Son of Iron Man', it would have been a fine, if formulaic, super hero film incorporating the usual teenage trials and tribulations. As it is presented, it is an abomination for any fan of the comics (and I've been reading them since the first issue by the way). It seems par for the course these days that the media in all forms seems compelled to make concessions to the brave new world our social engineers have conjured up for us, but this thing takes it to new, totally unrecognisable (basic costume design aside of course) lows ‚Äì I'm sure others will have covered everything I'm going to say here, from the fact that the main character (sticking to walls aside) bears little resemblance to the comic character (no spider sense, or it seems, increased strength), to the far more problematic changes to almost every supporting character out of all recognition for what must only be a super powered diversity and political correctness enforcement team operating at the Marvel studio.

","When I was a kid a used to read, and I still have those comic books, Spider-Man a lot.
Now I am a man, for some time now, and looking at a high school sophomore fight, for all intents and purposes, real harden criminals is just to far fetched for me, even if he was bitten by a spider. He has enhanced senses not enhanced heart. When your a kid this is a plausible idea, but as a man it is not.
Spiders can be killed also. When you have kids and women (and both weigh no more than 130 pounds, give or take) doing the exact same thing as, or against, people that are 250 pounds of better (in the case of villians) is just becomes a joke and insults our intelligence.
Moreover, it diminishes what their male counterparts (who are significantly larger, stronger, quicker and faster) are doing. Oh yeah, at the end spidey is walking with Stark and Downey is at least 4 or 5 inches taller and Downey is all of 5' 6"" maybe and a BIG MAYBE, 5 ' 7"". Maybe camera angle but really, even smaller spiders were crushed. But I digress.
The role of superhero is that of anyone nowadays, and from the looks of it ANYONE is taking over.
Watch the end of (very, very close to the end) of ""Bowfinger"" with Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy . They are karate guys but they are old and slow and have, well, problems physically, but they beat the crap out of hundreds of Ninjas. It looks funny, but you get the point.
At least the other ""superheroes"" are adult males. Again , there is no way a high school sophomore is doing what he did even if he was bitten by a spider, just not happening.
The movie has him, at the end, all of a sudden attached to the bad guy flying to the plane and on the plane, not in the plane, his spidey web works outside, again not happening.
If it wasn't for my kids i would never watch these movies.
Again, as an adult I have a really hard time watching a 14 or 15 kid become violent and tough and take down numerous super villians.
So if you do not have kids, be an adult and see an adult picture or watch one from the 1930s of 1940s with meaning and not let these people get ultra rich doing a mediocre job, which is all the height they can attain and this movie proves it.
Thanks for reading

","Scratching head. Was the ""Homecoming"" subtitle in reference to the two- second Homecoming Dance scene??<br/><br/>Also weird: in a movie starring Marisa Tomei, Robert Downey Jr., Michael Keaton, Jon Favreau and a decent Penis Parker, Tom Holland, the most and ONLY interesting character in the movie was the hilarious sidekick, Ned (Jacob Batalon.) With the exception of some funny background characters, like some of the teachers and definitely out-of-nowhere-and-everywhere Michelle, Ned was the one I felt was worth the price of admission for.<br/><br/>This says something about this version. I barely cared for anyone in this movie. On whether they lived, succeeded or fell in love. I was just given information, i.e. a ton of movie exposition, and was told to accept it. That's alright if one doesn't want to follow the golden rule of ""Show, Don't Tell,"" but I grew up on that method. I'd rather feel something for characters and story-arcs by means of showing me emotion than being told how to feel.<br/><br/>I digress. The movie wasn't necessarily bad, but it was almost dead- center okay. It had a TON of hilarious, laugh-out-loud moments, again, mostly involving Ned, but also the teacher's reactions and public service announcements from Cap. And the 15% or so of the movie that was devoted to action, it was entertaining with some fresh ideas.<br/><br/>Basically, Parker spends his day chasing his idol vs having that great power/great responsibly we've known him to learn. Finally, he literally becomes Iron Man to follow leads his mentors won't listen to. Will Parker become his own again and save the day? Sheesh, I couldn't even keep a straight face while typing that.<br/><br/>One thing before the movie, and obviously set up in the MCU's Civil War movie, that irked me tremendously was Tony Stark's involvement of Spider-Man's suit and training. This is NOT the Spider-Man I grew up with, nor was shown in any adaptation on screen. Spider-Man is supposed to make his own suit, figure out his own special powers, solve the mystery and become the MAN part of his name¬Öall on his own.<br/><br/>Luckily, with a somewhat decent script here, they devote a little time to that, but for the majority of the movie we were watching Iron Man Jr. on screen vs. Spider-Man. While some of those scenes were absolutely hilarious and added a lot to the enjoyment, this never truly felt like a Spider-Man movie to me. I'd go as far to say it's a full-blown MCU movie with co-co-star Spider-Man.<br/><br/>It's not a movie I want to see again any time soon and can't really recommend it for the big screen since the majority of enjoyment you'll get is just by laughing at the jokes in-between the enormously long lulls of inaction. <br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Final thoughts: Here's my ranking of the Spider-Man movies, excluding his Civil War cameo since it was just that:<br/><br/>1. Spider-Man<br/><br/>2. Spider-Man 2<br/><br/>3. Spider-Man 3<br/><br/>4. Spider-Man: Homecoming<br/><br/>5. The Amazing Spider-Man 2<br/><br/>6. The Amazing Spider-Man"

How Aunt May is younger, Flash is a math nerd instead of a jock, Spidey himself being codependent on Tony Stark and the high-tech suit given to him. But why did we have to sit through teenage high school fantasy fumbling? Really? Homecoming was a like a made-for-TV Nickeloden movie. I could care less about how Peter Parker tries to fit back in to his daily life after Civil War. Yay, we skipped a whole origin story this time around - who needs it for Spider-Man after so many reboots, right? But to have to sit through so much 'a day in the life of Peter Parker' was just torturous. After amazing movies like Logan and Guardians of the Galaxy 2,it felt like an insulting step backwards to sit through the teen-fest of Homecoming. Now that Marvel has created a totally integrated 'Universe' to get us to watch every movie because they are all joined to form a bigger, deeper picture, we are goaded into watching even mediocre films like this. Just to keep up with continuity.<br/><br/>I can't see myself shelling out hundreds of dollars the next few years for movie tickets and popcorn just to see more Marvel fare like Homecoming.<br/><br/>For those that saw the movie already. You know how Tony Stark drops Peter off at home near the beginning of the movie? That apparently took place right after the big superhero skirmish in Civil War. Then near the end of Homecoming Parker gets called to go see Stark at his headquarters? If, after the Civil War fight, Parker went straight to Stark's building and that ending scene occurred the exact same way, you could just wipe the entire Homecoming movie out and everything would be fine. Homecoming literally is just a filler movie. It has zero impact on the whole Marvel Cinematic Universe.<br/><br/>If you want to argue that Homecoming was still entertaining, all I can say is that I wasn't the only one in the theater who sighed with disgust when Parker found out that the girl he's taking out on a date just happens to be the daughter of his arch enemy. Come on. These clich√© coincidences just have to stop.<br/><br/>What was good about the movie? I liked Tony Stark's influence with Spider-Man's suits.

","In this Spider-man‚ÄîMCU hybrid, the MCU insists on itself to the point of annoyance. All you will hear is that it's like a John Hughes film and that that makes it a good film. The movie plays like a John Hudges film then comes to a screeching halt as soon as the writers remember they're writing a superhero movie. It goes back and forth like this throughout the movie. As a result, the movie struggles because it never commits to fully to either genre. Then we get Tony Stark whose impact on the story is so significant you wonder which movie you're actually watching.<br/><br/>From the very start, the movie plays up the significance of the battle in New York which Spider-man had nothing to do with. OK, no big deal. Maybe spider-man will find relevance as the story plods on. No not really. The argument here is that Peter gets the most screen time and Tony Stark gets far less but that distracts from the point. Tony Stark is a cloud hanging over this movie that never truly allows Spider-man to shine. <br/><br/>Gone are the days spider-man would think on his feet, develop devices or work out solutions on his own. Now, he gets Tony Starks hand-me-downs. His true character is lost in the suit behind all the gizmos and software. He's an iron-man clone. He now has Siri which is just a copy of jarvis in Iron-man. Spider-man has a face-off with an unmasked vulture for the first time and even then all the would-be villain talks about is his contempt for Tony Stark not Spider-man. The end of the movie involves Spider-man stopping Vulture stealing alien tech from Tony Stark. I've mention Tony Stark/Iron man so much, you start to see what I mean when I say this feels more like an iron man film.<br/><br/>All we are left with is the high school drama which falls short of John Hughes aspirations it emphasizes. What you end up with is a pale imitation of the real thing. The diversity here feels forced which in and of itself isn't the problem. It's the fact that the characters are bland and have no depth. The bully who's a version of Flash Thompson never feels imposing. His bullying amounts to calling Peter Parker, Penis Parker. I kid you not. And as though the writers thought it was the funniest joke in the movie the repeat it a second time. You will find a lot of awkward jokes throughout the movie. The other teenagers are even less defined. Other than Ned his close friend who spends enough time with him we have a better sense of his personality that's it. Michelle throws one-liners, has no personality to speak off and serves literally no purpose in the story. He has no Spider-Sense, it's never explained why. None of the other diversity hires arise beyond what can be best described as a cameo. Donald Glover, the principal, shocker come off as just plot-devices as opposed to real fleshed-out characters.<br/><br/>Michael Keaton's turn as the villain is of note. He gives the best performance in an otherwise lackluster ensemble cast. He really feels imposing despite the fact that movie has no real stakes. Yes, that's another issue. No one is really in danger. No one's life really feels threatened. The villain himself doesn't commit any heinous crime. Actually that's not true there's one thing he does but even that is done by mistake. Everything just feels watered down. As a direct consequence the action is watered down as well. Tom Holland is mostly annoying in his short breath performance. He works well enough in the high school since however. Also No mention of uncle Ben instead what we get a running gag about how hot Aunt May is now. I guess the idea was to have Tony Stark play the father figure but there's no bond between the two to justify it. He refuses to hug Peter in one scene. He lectures Peter through the whole movie. He mostly appears to be more like an asshole than a protective father.<br/><br/>I was excited when the Sony and Marvel reached an agreement to bring Spider-man into the MCU. But now after seeing the result I'm largely disappointed. The Raimi movies never required you to watch any extra material to care about the story. You can get lost in this new iteration if you haven't watch Avengers and Iron man. Marvel fans will celebrate the movie for all it's MCU shout outs, name drops, easter eggs, cameos and all that jazz. Who cares. I just wanted a Spider-man movie."

"soxlade","7","5","11","10 July 2017"," Definitive Spiderman is the best Marvel of the year
","Spiderman:Homecoming is the first film with Peter Parker as a fully- fledged member of the MCU.<br/><br/>Peter Parker, plucked from obscurity in Queens to assist 'Team Stark' in the Civil War, finds himself sidelined. Told to stand up for the little guy, our erstwhile superhero finds himself directing lost old ladies and beating up muggers, all the while feeling that he could do more. Overconfident as a superhero, he is the polar opposite at high school where he is the champion of the quiz team and shyly attracted to Liz. After Spiderman foils a bank robbery which is performed with some slightly outlandish weaponry, our hero begins to track the source of the weapons, which leads back to Adrian Toomes, a contractor who is bitter for being kicked off the lucrative Chitari cleanup contracts and lost a lot of money. Toomes now uses an elaborate flying suit and chitari technology to steal alien artefacts to continue his profitable weapon sales operation.<br/><br/>Tom Holland as Peter Parker is quite excellent in the role. For the first time in any Spiderman film, we have a teenage Spiderman and the film does very well in making us feel that this guy is just a kid, and a somewhat weedy one at that. Looking small and uncomfortable whenever he is at school (yet curiously buff when stripping in and out of his outfit), he is frequently shown in long shot or against massive backdrops to highlight just how out of his depth he is in this world of superheroes. Charming, enthusiastic, hubristic, and flawed, Holland's Spiderman is a triumph of character and actor combining to produce a winning cinematic creation. In a Marvel film so often there is little sense of peril, but here we become genuinely concerned for Peter. We fear for his safety several times. It's great. <br/><br/>As a foil to Spiderman we have the ever-wonderful Michael Keaton as Adrian Toomes, aka Vulture. A disaffected American worker, he's the embodiment of the American Dream laid low by big corporations stealing the contracts for themselves. At one point Keaton growls that ""the guys who created this mess now get paid to clean it up"". It's hard not to sympathise with him, and Keaton's superb performance really sells this villain as a believable creation. So long a weak point in Marvel movies, Toombs is one of the best villains the franchise has created; threatening, charming, understandable, sympathetic, psychotic, and motivated. <br/><br/>The rest of the cast are fine, though the constant reappearances of Tony Stark starts to grate. I found myself yearning for a charismatic older actor playing the Uncle Ben/father figure role. Stark is a dick, and it is hard to see him giving life-lessons to a kid when he basically created the whole situation in the first place. <br/><br/>You'll be pleased to know that the action sequences are all very good indeed, a sequence on the Washington Monument being a standout (and in 3D this really delivers). Whenever Spiderman is taking on multiple opponents with a flurry of web shots, punches, kicks, flips, wall hangs and sarcastic commentary from the snarky kid in red and blue it is brilliantly entertaining. <br/><br/>There are problems, however. Firstly there film feels quite flat. Moments that are clearly meant to be humorous don't deliver. Likewise some of the action sequences seem a bit rote, like something you'd see in Agents of SHIELD rather than a mega-budget movie. There is also un- necessary sub-scenes and nods that didn't quite fit with the characters, or the story, or the tone of the film. <br/><br/>The other major problem with the film is the existence of Kick-Ass. Michael Vaughan's film clearly owes a great debt to Spiderman, but watching Homecoming it is hard to shake the feeling of deja vu, especially when you see Spiderman walking around the neighbourhood using his powers on low- level muggers. Both films create believable teenagers, give them superpowers, have them get bored and listless, then have them get out of their depth before eventually triumphing. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, due to the unimaginative direction mentioned above, Kick-Ass is a superior film. The slight dips that Homecoming suffers from (the nerdy best friend irritating, the love interest bland, the humour flat, some of the action cheap, and plot twists are visible a mile away) Kick-Ass doesn't.<br/><br/>However I fully understand that this is the film that Spiderman fans have been waiting for, and it is as slick and enjoyable a film as Marvel has ever made. It is the first time Spiderman is seen as he should be: as a kid. The film is very good, the best Marvel of the year, but this reviewer enjoyed Wonder Woman more; it was also energetic, propulsive, colourful, lively and tear- jerkingly heroic. Homecoming doesn't quite engage the same emotions in this reviewer."

I was beginning to think I was in for a good movie. But, the storyline was plain, it want very exciting at all. There were some very poor spots, for example when Michael Keaton was driving the car and figured out that Parker was Spiderman. Great actor with a terrible script. I won't discourage anyone to go and see it, other than parents with children under 13. The movie makes the F word a fashionable word with phrases like What the _____ as the last phrase of the movie.

"fredschaefer-406-623204","8","5","11","8 July 2017"," Third Time is the Charm
","As a lifelong Spider-Man fan and comic reader, I found the previous five film incarnations of the Wall Crawler to be a mixture of pluses and minuses, some heavier on the latter than other (talking about you Spider Man 3), but I am happy to say that the latest reboot of my favorite comic super hero, SPIDER-MAN: HOMECOMING, definitely has way more positives to its credit than just about any of the earlier films. It captures the sense of fun present in the Saturday morning cartoon versions. What makes HOMECOMING better than the rest: First of all, the script, which does not feel like a cut and paste job like some other comic book adaptations, the X-Men franchise being among the worst offenders. The writers follow up on the premise of CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR, where we first saw this teen age version of Peter Parker. HOMECOMING digs deep and finds what made those early Lee-Ditko collaborations so great: the nerdy high school science geek who is becomes a dynamic hero when he puts on the iconic suit and hits the streets of NYC to battle crime. Of course, we know it is not the costume that makes Peter Parker a hero, but what is inside his heart that really counts and this point very clear. Also gone is the angst and grimness of the Toby Maguire and Andrew Garfield portrayals: this Spider-Man is having a blast being a super hero; there is plenty of power and responsibility, but there is plenty of fun as well. Peter's determination to win the approval of Tony Stark and become a full fledged member of The Avengers, can be taken as a orphan young man's search for a worthy father. It's a nice touch, and thank God we don't have to watch Uncle Ben take a bullet one more damn time, in fact he's not even mentioned. I do commend the writers for giving us a movie with three distinct acts, and the big battle on the ferry, which is prominently featured in the trailers, is only the climax to the second act.<br/><br/>The casting of Tom Holland is a big plus for this movie. I now he does not really look like he's 15, but he well captures the teen age heart of his character; he's the kid who tries to do what is right, and when he makes mistakes ‚Äì big mistakes ‚Äì he gets back on his feet and does not give up. Robert Downey Jr. returns, yet again, as Tony Stark, the role he was born to play. Stark is a supporting character here, but his shadow falls across everything Peter Parker does, as his customary flippant and sarcastic manner hides the fact that he sees tremendous potential in his young prot√©g√©, it's just that he has a lot to learn, and most of it will have to be learned the hard. Gwyneth Paltrow has a brief appearance as Pepper Potts where her relationship with Tony gets taken to another level. Jon Favereau's Happy Hogan has some great scenes with Holland's Peter Parker, and does get one of the best lines in the movie. Chris Evans's Steve Rogers has a couple of very humorous cameos.<br/><br/>Most super hero movies sink or swim on the strength of their villains, and in the case of HOMECOMING, they hit a home run with the casting of Michael Keaton as Adrian Toomes, aka The Vulture. The script writers were wise to give him a understandable reason for his crimes: he's a working class guy, trying hard to earn a living and feed his family, and when the higher authorities screw him out of a lucrative salvage job after the alien invasion from first Avengers movie, Toomes decides to take some stolen alien tech and build super weapons for street criminals, setting in motion a bank robbery that is foiled by Spider-Man and setting the hero and villain on a collision course. This is Keaton first super hero film since he took off Batman's cape (I do not count BIRDMAN, for which Keaton was robbed of an Oscar) and makes the most of it. Keaton's Toomes is not one of those underdeveloped bad guys we've seen in too many other comic adaptations (SUICIDE SQUAD and DOCTOR STRANGE instantly to mind); the script makes a point of showing how intelligent he is, as when he puts two and two together and easily figures out Spider-Man's secret identity. Welcome back to the comics, Michael Keaton, it has been too long.<br/><br/>Bokeem Woodbine and Logan Marshall-Green play The Shocker at different times in the movie; Michael Mando (Nacho from BETTER CALL SAUL) plays Mac Gargan, who in the comic book, becomes The Scorpion.<br/><br/>If there is anything negative to say about the movie, it's that some of the tweaks they've made to Spider-Man's supporting cast are a long way from their comic book origins; I like Flash Thompson as an obnoxious jock and foil to Peter Parker, and I would love to see a smoking hot Mary Jane Watson who is determined to be a successful model, maybe I just want to see a film version of the classic, ""Face it, Tiger, you just hit the jackpot"" introduction. But I've got no problem with Marisa Tomei's much younger and Italian Aunt May; we've had two senior citizen versions of her and this take is refreshing. Also appearing in supporting roles are Tyne Daley, Martin Starr, Hannibal Buress, and of course, the cameo by Stan Lee.<br/><br/>The best thing I can say about HOMECOMING is that it finally bring Peter Parker home to the MCU where he belongs, beside Cap and Tony and the rest of the gang. My wish for them is to bring back the best of the earlier movies in the sequel, namely JK Simmons's J. Jonah Jameson and Dane DeHaan's Harry Osborn/Green Goblin, that would be something for which to look forward."

Personally right now I'm in high school and when I look at the old Spider-Man movies and I see a ""bully"" I start to actually laugh because that's not how bullies are! They did the right thing by making Flash a regular guy who's just more popular then other people that's how bullies are now a days. The villain is also in my top three of best marvel movie villains.

When Holland replied, saying a project with action and humor would be of interest to him, the reporter asked if he would ever like to play a superhero. ""Maybe Spider-Man, in ten years time,"" answered Holland. ""The reboot of the reboot, if they do that."" Spider-Man never punches any of the villains he fights. He uses his webs, he counters his enemies punches which causes them to punch each other, he even kicks them, but he never punches them. Nineteen-year-old Tom Holland was the youngest actor to be cast as Peter Parker. Tobey Maguire was cast at 25, and Andrew Garfield was 26.<br/><br/>
*Emotion- A very fun and enjoyable film. Tom Holland does the best presentation of this gymnastic teenage super hero than any actor before him. He has extensive gymnastic and dance training for the physical work and he has just the right juvenile tone to his character when needed in those school, family, and neighborhood scenes.

"Floated2","8","2","3","29 March 2019"," Great addition to the Spider-Man franchise
","Being a fan of the Spider-Man franchise in general, one was very eager in watching the film. After hearing and seeing many positive reviews, expectations were somewhat high. And after watching the film, the expectations were as expected met and the film is as good and entertaining as read.<br/><br/>What makes Homecoming a great film is that it is entertaining and the film does not take itself too serious. There is much less drama and overall it didn't have this depressing and sad tone about it (like how the Amazing Spider-Man films were). So in that sense, the general tone was a much happier and more fun.<br/><br/>Tom Holland was also a great look for the role of Peter Parker, as he does look the age (much more younger in comparison to the previous Spider-Men in Tobey McGuire and Andrew Garfield), and he also has the charisma and an energetic feel about him which make as it seem as he is interested in the character.<br/><br/>Where as Tobey was decent but at the same time, had this sad and wondrous look on his face, and Andrew was more moody, emo and slightly unlikable (at least more so i the 2nd of his films).<br/><br/>Another thing which made the film great was the overall addition with Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man. The plot was different here than in previous Spider-Man films which was fresh and entertaining.<br/><br/>Also, Spider-Man's suit was also by far the best of the previous entries, as in this film since technology is more up to date, we actually see an upgrade with the suit (Yet this seemed to annoy people as there have been some backlash)<br/><br/>Negative comments about the film are the fact that the film feels more child friendly and teenager ascendant, which is the point of the film. As there are many scenes revolving around his highschool (hence the title of ""Homecoming"")<br/><br/>Overall, this film was as expected as did enjoy it. Hopefully its sequel coming this summer meets expectations and continues this great franchise."

Very well done."
"The_Film_Auditor","7","2","3","17 July 2018"," Not a Marvel Fan, but enjoyed this film
","Going into Spiderman: Homecoming, I was very worried for two reasons. One, I still had the terrible taste of The Amazing Spiderman 2 in my mouth making me not particularly excited for ANOTHER Spiderman movie. Two, some would call me a Marvel sceptic. I have never really liked any of their movies with a few exceptions (e.g., Iron Man), and some of the recent films, such as Age of Ultron or Captain America: Civil War, have left me fatigued with the entire superhero genre. Well with those things in mind, I went into Spiderman: Homecoming with very low expectations and I was pleasantly surprised. Yes, this is still a Disney Marvel superhero movie, so it is not groundbreaking or very original, but it is better than most of Marvel's pervious work.<br/><br/>One of the main things I think this movie does well is the depiction of Spiderman. In the film, Peter Parker is a relatable superhero who is still in high school and going through many things normal people went through during adolescence, such as dealing with bulling, trying to ask someone to homecoming, etc. This helped me build a better relationship to Spiderman since I could relate to him, more so than I could to Thor or Captain America. Spiderman acts like how a normal person who just became a superhero would act. He struggles with realistic issues such as keeping secrets from people he cares about, budgeting his time between normal life and fighting crime, and being ignored by someone he looks up to. All of these issues are much more interesting than the issues many other of the characters in the MCU deal with. Another thing that I think makes this film better than its counterparts is the storyline and villain. I am very happy we did not see a third origin story of how he got his powers. The superhero origin story has been beaten to death, so it was a good move to avoid it. Instead of an origin story, Spiderman: Homecoming tells the story of a Spiderman who is struggling to get the attention of the Avengers, a team of individuals he looks up to highly. It also shows Spiderman going up against The Vulture, an Alien removal worker turned illegal arms dealer. The plot is much more interesting and has more depth than other Marvel movies, but still feels generic and safe. All of these elements helped make this film stand out amongst the masses of superhero films being produced today.<br/><br/>Of course, just because this film was better than many other superhero movies, it does not mean it doesn't have its flaws. As I mentioned before, the film's plot was very safe and unoriginal. It still felt calculated and created by a board of executives at Disney. It did not have a distinct style like the Sam Raimi Spidermans, and that made for a non-innovative film. Instead, the movie looks like any other of the brightly colored CGI superhero movies being released today. I also felt like the story lacked originality, but at least there weren't any giant blue beams shooting into the sky. It also felt as though many of the characters were high schooler stereotypes, such as MJ, who felt unnecessary in this film. Overall, this film felt safe but somewhat different to the other MCU movies. So, in that regard, it is a great Marvel movie, but in the big picture, it is a decent action/superhero film, nothing more nothing less.<br/><br/>The Good
-Relatable main character
-Spiderman faces realistic issues
-Ned is hilarious
-Has some fun moments<br/><br/>The Bad
-Very safe
-Original for Marvel, unoriginal for cinema
-Stereotypical characters
-Lacking style, both visually and in storytelling"

","I was really exited to see the movie. But the whole movie is some kind of boring. There is no magic around Spiderman, no good enemies, no real plot or great characters. It's like a introduction of the new spider man for coming marvel films. That could have been done in 15 minutes. Skipping the standard - how spidey is born - start was a risky and interesting step, but because of this we do not get any information about it besides he was bitten by a spider.
The movie is ok to watch, nothing great or spectacular, and it is miles away from the spiderman films before."

"xristoff93","5","2","3","21 January 2018"," Kids will love it....You will not! This was ""United colous of super goofy""
","-This could very easily be the worst spider man movie I've ever watched. For starters, this was more like super goofy! Forced jokes all over the place, a continuing silliness in every scene. And many many many efforts for antiracism. Was this spider man or an activist promotion film?So peter parker's best friend is a fat asian kid now,his high schooll bully is indian(flash) and an overall decent kid and student,his crush is african american and mary jane is an ebony(?) stalker, always following parker around and her name is ""MJ for her friends"" while her name is not Mary Jane at all?What?!And shocker is a useless white guy killed off by another white guy only to be replaced by another useless guy, but this time black!?And Parker himself is kinda redhead with freckles?
-Besides that, the plot was weak, the pace was uneven and the story telling was poor to say the least, resulting in a cringy and kinda boring film. Spider man was goofing around all the time, he seemed extremely weak and useless. And that would be fine if they had not previously presented him in ""civil war"" as a guy who could fight captain america on equal footing ,and that while being able to afford more goofing around at the time. No continuity whatsover. As for story telling etc...look at the beginning: And here we have SPIDER MAN!!DA TA!...Of course we all know about spider man but shouldn't they show us how he got his powers?How his parents or uncle die?Especially his uncle's death was supposed to be a critical moment in spider man's character shaping.And what about people who have not seen or read about spider-man before,how will they know how he got his powers and what his powers are exactly?I mean, these things are pretty basic. And what about the villains?Do all trash disposal companies hire MIT graduates to get rid of trash and ruins or is it that easy for anyone to hack and modify alien technology and reshape it into human-style weapons? Another thing, his friend was such a genius at computers that could easily hack the high tech suit Iron Man gave him?Like that?And without Stark getting wind of it?Then we have Iron Man coming up and sticking together a boat while it's flooding and he just flies away like that?And what about his aunt?She was more like his older and smoking hot stepsister. Ans she finds out his secret like that? And I can go on and on but I thing you get the picture here. And what about Shocker?He is black now?After Electro who was also made to be black in the previous reboot?And I do not care about the colour of his skin. He could be pakistani for all I care. But there is no point presenting us with a story only to change it later for a political(ly correct) agenda. It is a matter of continuity.Black torch,black electro,black shocker.Are we looking forward to an all black hero and villain series so that people won't call you racist? Changing a character or story in general for that reason, is racist by itself.And to be clear on that, I am not racist.I like all people if they're nice.
-Both after credits scenes were pointless even though the second one was kinda funny.
-All in all, we have another Hollywood eyecandy, with no plot, no feeling behind the characters, a very weak and kinda unlikable protagonist and dull fights with explosive endings.It was good for wasting a couple of hours but this was not spider man.If that is what they make spider man to be from now on, I do not like it. At least kids will probably like it. What shame......."

","I guess I should not be too surprised given the Spider Man character we saw in the latest Captain America but I have to say that I was, well, hoping for something else, as in something better.<br/><br/>If the producer/writer intended to make a Spider Man movie for kids, and I mean kids, not young adults but kids, then this movie is hitting the spot. It is an excellent action/adventure movie for kids. Unfortunately I am not really in that viewer segment and for me this movie was pretty bad.<br/><br/>The movie is childish. There is no other way to describe it. My memory of spider man is a quite serious young man with a sharp and witty tongue. Not the fumbling and childish Spider Man in this movie. His best friend may be a good computer geek but otherwise he is dumb as a door nail and just tiring to watch. His, supposedly adult handler is a screw up who, surprise surprise, is hanging up the phone because he cannot be bothered to listen to kids.<br/><br/>The FX may be good as FX goes visually but it was also the typical, nonsensical Hollywood rubbish like boats that stays afloat forever despite being split in half etc. etc. The talking Spider Man suit appears to be programmed by the same guy who wrote the childish script.<br/><br/>The main bad guy pretty much has zero charisma and is nothing but a simple thief. Same goes for his buddies.<br/><br/>The SJW crap spread out here and there in the movie, especially in the Washington Monument scenes, was unwanted and just pissed me off.<br/><br/>I am afraid that this movie missed its mark for me by a wide margin. I do not understand why it seems to be so bloody difficult for Hollywood to make a good Spider Man movie. I like Spider Man, the comics character that is, so I find the slew of substandard movies really disappointing.<br/><br/>The only reason it doesn't get less than two out of three stars from me is because, as a kids movie, it is not at all bad (except for the SJW crap). It wasn't what I was looking for though."

"BryGuySaysHi","5","2","3","8 October 2017"," Thought this was Spiderman, not a PG-13 Deadpool Knockoff
","It felt like a Deadpool knockoff, except Deadpool was actually funny. What a joke they have turned Spiderman into and a huge slap in the face to fans of the original trilogy with Tobey Maguire. Tom Holland (who plays this Spiderman) is a complete joke in this film. I can't tell if it's bad acting or terrible script writing, but it just didn't work. Jacob Batalon (Spiderman's friend) was the only thing that saved this film from being a disaster. He plays his role so well and is a huge relief after dealing with Tom Holland's horrible attempt at comedy.<br/><br/>The first thing that will strike you, is the fact that there was no backstory into how he became Spiderman. This takes a lot away from the movie. But then again, this was a comedy, not a drama so I might be wrong in that department. The next thing that will catch your eye is the terrible CGI. Spiderman bounces around the screen completely weightless. Moving on to the story, the love interest in this didn't feel real at all. Again, there was no backstory to what sparked them to start noticing each other. I also found it funny when the students started hating on Peter Parker for the dumbest of all reasons. There were so many cringe worthy moments with that as well as the love interest. The main story line with the villain and Iron Man was decent though. A few small twists here and there but mostly predictable. There is only so much you can do with a Super-Hero movie when sequels are inevitable and the actors want to play the same roles in the next movie for extra money.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm shocked that this is listed as Action/Adventure, Sci-Fi and not listed as Comedy on IMDb. The comedy in this is horrendous with Jacob Batalon single-handily saving the movie. Maybe if you are 13, you will enjoy this movie. I had high hopes when watching this, but I found out it was gone 5 minutes after Spiderman was introduced in the film."

","If you're 12 or 13 years old then you're going to love this movie, but it doesn't feel like a Spiderman movie.<br/><br/>I understand that the producers didn't want to tell the audience the origin story which has been told ad nauseam! However, it's still an important part of Spiderman's personality. WE NEED AN ORIGIN STORY and it doesn't need to be Uncle Ben getting shot or his famous line: ""with great power comes great responsibility"". I, for one, would have liked to have known how Peter Parker came onto Tony Stark's radar. Why would a billionaire with enough super suits to conquer a country need a fourteen-year-old boy or risk getting him killed in combat against seasoned soldiers? Right there is your origin story. All the other Marvel superheroes had their origin story by Spiderman/boy didn't.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. I loved watching this film and it gave me great laughs during the comedic scenes but....... I was left with no idea as to what motivates him to want to fight crime. In this version, we just get a kid who's barely out of puberty and whose sole purpose is to please Tony Stark. The high-tech suit which was given to him was cool but it diverts attention from Spiderman's acrobatic abilities. There is too much dependence on technology and not enough on his resourcefulness. In other words, Tony Stark appears too much in this movie."

And, it's pretty great! It feels more like a cartoon so it really fits well with Spider-Man's character, Tom Holland as Peter Parker is incredible, and the movie is extremely funny. Tony Stark (Iron-Man) as Spidey's, sort of, mentor is great. I've always liked Robert Downey Jr as Iron-Man so him teaching SPIDER-MAN of all people is just, just...AMAZING! Peter Parker's friend, Ned, is the best comic relief character in any movie to date because he's ACTUALLY FUNNY.

"lasttimeisaw","7","2","3","15 August 2017"," the main course is served, and the motto is let's go chipper!
","Back to the drawing board after Sony opting for foreshortening THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN franchise, and recruited into the ever-expanding Marvel Comic Universe, this Spider-Man re-redux features a new web-slinger Tom Holland, treads the same treacherous water of being repetitive (an aggregate of 6 stand-alone summer blockbusters in the past 15 years), but smartly angles for re- connecting with a sizably younger demography by coordinating Peter Parker as a high schooler and emphatically bowdlerizes his tragedy-laden original story (no mentioning of his parents, or the demise of uncle Ben, or how he acquire the superpower), after this new Spidey's scintillating debut in CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR (2016) as an amuse-bouche, now the main course is served, and the motto is let's go chipper! <br/><br/>The prologue concisely dwells on the movie's main villain Adrian Toomes aka, Vulture (Keaton), an arms trafficker who has no ambition to lay waste to the world and wisely chooses to stay under the radar for his profiteering business of forging mass destructive weapons graced with extraterrestrial substances. The film kick-starts with the caption of ""a film made by Peter Parker"", a fuzzy video shot by his phone which evinces his excitement of becoming an Avenger and he is all keyed up for the next big teamwork which seems to be indefinitely parked. <br/><br/>So, life goes on, after all the thrills and spills dissipate, Peter is back on his neighborhood watch escapades, has his first crush on a senior student Liz (Harrier), and inadvertently reveals his secret identity in front of his best friend, the computer-savvy Ned (Batalon), director Jon Watts and his writers make sure there are sufficient gags and jokes to cosset upbeat youngsters and it is a decisive move to reinvigorate a markedly fatigued franchise. After several skirmishes with Vulture and his cronies, including a heroic rescue in the Washington Monument of his academic decathlon teammates, and a ferry fracas nearly causes great casualties, Peter is reprimanded by Iron Man (Downey Jr.) and his bespoke intelligent suit is confiscated. <br/><br/>Becoming an Avenger seems hopeless at that point, but for a 15-year-older high schooler, there is something more imperative to do, for example, to invite Liz as his date in the homecoming dance. Only a twist will soon bring Peter face to face with Mr. Toomes, and an ensuing aerial-to-ground battle devised as the final showdown ultimately comes across as derivative and uninspiring, it is not such a compliment to the craftsmanship if one is constantly occupied with galling trivialities such as why Spidey's homemade suit is so durable or why the close-range combat is so inanely gore-less? <br/><br/>Pitifully, this reboot isn't a real trooper to give a completely absorbing makeover of one of our most beloved comic heroes, or to shatter the status quo of the comics adaptation formula, although one can see that it has the potential to do so, Tom Holland is a beneficent choice to wear the suit, utterly down-to-earth and charmingly spontaneous, let's only hope he will not be typecast in the future. The whole cast is meritoriously inclusive, each character is given their distinctive individuality, and Michael Keaton, after his self-referential come back in BIRDMAN (2014), looks pretty self-paradoxical taking a fat check in this winged about-face, haranguing his much junior opponent with his faux-family value which belies a thinly veiled egoism and callousness, as a villain, he has his matter-of-fact tack but nonetheless, slumps into an old chestnut when it comes to profit and confrontation."
"joebloggscity","6","2","3","16 July 2017"," Heart-warming and endearing reboot but one for the teenagers...
","Okay, we've had Spiderman for many years in many formats. The Saturday morning cartoon shows in various formats, the old 70s show, the various films and so on. So we all love Spidey yet with all the recent comic book successes Spidey has been usurped by some of his compatriots like Iron Man. The Andrew Garfield movies despite various good points just didn't make an impact, but this reboot might just do it.<br/><br/>Based on the Ultimate Spiderman series, thankfully we don't have an umpteenth repeat of the same old origins story, but this restart is wrapped up in the MCU world. Our teenage Spidey has growing pains with bullies and girls, and we see him having to take on the might of a mega-villain with superior weaponry, in this case a wonderful show stealing performance by Michael Keaton.<br/><br/>The acting is fine, the action great and it's all a bit more down to earth. Thankfully none of that great big being with lighting striking the sky big battles, but little heroes and villains.<br/><br/>I kind of liked it, but really maybe I'm a little old for some of it. It really will hit the mark for teenagers and older geeks, which I'm neither. The wise cracking get's flogged to death. It can work in a comic or cartoon, but the length of a long movie? They could have stepped back. Marisa Tomei as Aunt May is fabulous, and a favourite for the older viewers.<br/><br/>This is a bit of a sidewards movie in the MCU universe films, and it's fine. It will definitely find a market as it's unoffensive and enjoyable just not for me. Still, as said, it's fun and pays homage to its forebears. Expect this theme of Spidey to carry on for a number of movies."

"asifahsankhan","7","8","21","4 July 2017"," Tom Holland gives the best on-screen portrayal of teenage Spidey in a not-so-friendly-neighbourhood-plot, yet!
","Spider-Man: Homecoming's only achievement is that it makes you forget it's the third different Spider-Man ‚Äì and second reboot ‚Äì in less than 20 years. <br/><br/>We saw Tom Holland's take on Peter Parker steal the show in Captain America: Civil War, but his first solo outing lets him loose and the result is a joy to behold. No chance of Spidey fatigue, here.<br/><br/>Marvel movies succeed because they're not just superhero movies. Captain America: The Winter Soldier was a '70s conspiracy thriller; Guardians of the Galaxy a space opera. Enter Spider-Man: Homecoming, a frothy and witty John Hughes high school comedy that just happens to feature a superhero or two.<br/><br/>It's charming. It's hilarious. And it proves that Holland is the best on-screen teenage Spidey in a not-so-friendly-neighbourhood-plot, yet.<br/><br/>After the grand-scale conflict of Captain America: Civil War, Spider-Man goes back to basics as a hometown hero. Cut to two months later and Peter is still waiting for that call, while living with Aunt May. Instead of battling the forces of evil, he's battling the usual high school issues, including unrequited love with senior Liz and popularity woes with his best friend Ned.<br/><br/>But Peter soon spots his chance to impress Tony when he stumbles upon a black market weapons deal. He links the weapons to arms dealer Adrian Toomes (Michael Keaton/Batman gone Rogue now?), AKA Vulture, who has been modifying alien technology left over from Avengers' battles into deadly weapons.<br/><br/>So, with the help of Ned, Peter defies Tony's orders to stay in school and sets out to become more than just your friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man by stopping Vulture in his tracks, even if it means risking the lives of everyone he cares about.<br/><br/>Let's get one of the main concerns out of the way first: this is very much a Spider-Man movie and not Iron Man 3.5. In fact, Tony is barely in it, popping by every now and then to play reluctant mentor, but often leaving it to Happy (you know, Jon Favreau) to keep an eye on Peter. It means that Holland is centre stage and it's suited to him. With pitch-perfect comic timing, his Peter is an endearing, believable teenager whose enthusiasm is impossible to resist.<br/><br/>It helps that Holland is surrounded by an excellent young cast that you're happy to spend time with. There's good chemistry between Holland and Batalon, but Zendaya is the revelation, doing a lot with a little and delivering big laughs as Michelle. Homecoming's strongest set piece comes when Peter's classmates are in danger, a testament to the affection built up from their engaging performances.<br/><br/>That set piece sees Spidey swing to the rescue when his classmates are trapped in the Washington Monument. The tense sequence makes good use of vertigo-inducing angles to add genuine peril ‚Äî a rarity in a superhero movie ‚Äî without forgetting character beats. Homecoming falls into a common Marvel complaint with a messy, overblown climactic set piece but, even then, manages to make it have a personal edge, much like the final battle in Civil War.<br/><br/>But what Homecoming does avoid is Marvel's villain problem, with Vulture a better version of Iron Man 2's Whiplash, more grounded and empathetic. Keaton's performance avoids scenery chewing and is all the better for it, especially in one menacing confrontation with Peter. That's about as dark as the movie gets, though. This isn't Spider- Man 3.<br/><br/>Homecoming also confidently deals with the reboot problem of telling the same story over again. So we don't have to see Uncle Ben die for the 100th time, even if his death is alluded to, and Peter's origin story is dealt with in a fun conversation with Ned. The confidence also extends to Marvel taking the Pi$$ out of itself a bit, with the Cap being the Butt of the joke, especially.<br/><br/>Throw one of Marvel's best post-credits scenes into the mix, and you have one of their most entertaining outings to date. Spider-Man: Homecoming leaves you wanting to swing wherever Holland's Spidey goes next.<br/><br/>(SIDEBAR: Tom Holland dazzles surely but I've seen better a Spider- Man Movie than this one)."

Adrian Toomes leads a cleanup crew after the Avengers battle in NY, but is removed and replaced by Tony Stark's crew. Dejected, he decides to use the alien tech he got from his haul and make weapons out of it.<br/><br/>Parker plays part high school kid, part villain. Apparently he doesn't need to sleep, although, what do I know, maybe that part of his super power.<br/><br/>The story was okay for me, but I just wasn't captivated. The whole thing with the spidey-stark-suit got old quick. Peter Parker skipping out on the academic decathlon and no one really caring doesn't seem right. School kids go on a trip, one of them goes missing, and... no big deal as that's what the alternate is for? There's also a scene where the FBI gets involved and follows Toomes. A fight scene happens where he's *obviously* got some sort of alien tech going on, but Spiderman runs the operations so... they just leave him alone after that?<br/><br/>I was mildly entertained, but that's about it. Pretty forgettable movie."
"ljsmith-25626","8","1","1","12 May 2020"," Refreshing Spider-Man Adaptation
","Spider-Man: Homecoming seems to be polarising opinion amongst viewers. I think the people who hated it appear to be fanboys of either comic books or the original Tobey Maguire trilogy. Perhaps these viewers are too accustomed to the traditional Spider-Man legend and can't appreciate a bit of variation from the same story getting retold, reboot after reboot.<br/><br/>Tom Holland's take on everyone's favourite web slinging hero is refreshing. This Peter Parker's story picks up in the aftermath of Captain America: Civil War, and so we don't have to go through the whole kid gets bit by radioactive spider, uncle gets shot blah blah blah we all know how it goes. Homecoming slots perfectly into the wider MCU. The references throughout to the Avengers and events in previous films are never ending, giving a fascinating insight into how this fictional age of superheroes has taken its toll on the microcosmic environment of Peter's high school.<br/><br/>Holland's Parker is relatable, and he fills the role with so much fun and personality. Also, contrary to popular belief, the jokes in this film are genuinely funny and I'd rank Homecoming 2nd behind Guardians of the Galaxy in the Marvel comedy rankings. Overall, the MCU's Spider-Man is a hit - highly enjoyable with a gasp-worthy twist at the end (no spoilers) that make it more than just a shallow parody. Don't listen to the biased haters!!"

Rich and powerful are not things that turn us into evil beings... we are not you.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the entire movie revolved around this idea. Parker (like Stark) is a twit. The idea that people like them could invent anything is beyond asinine (same for Mysterio who cant think himself out of a paper bag). In the end, it was as you expect. The normal twit wins because they can out think a smart person when it counts and the smart guys are filth and make so many bad choices that its wonder that their autonomous system can even regulate their breathing.<br/><br/>Technically, this movie is your average comic book movie fare. Good CGI, acting is ok, story and dialog are about high school level. Comedy is on the bad side. There were some funny moments but they were far and few between.

","SPIDER-MAN HOMECOMING<br/><br/>RATING: 3.2/5
Okay, so i didn't hate Spider-Man Homecoming, contrary to popular belief, but i went into it with the mentality that all the MCU stuff is probably gonna be good, so I need to focus on the Spider-Man stuff alone. I'm sorry to say, but as a Spider-Man movie, Homecoming fails and it kinda fails hard.<br/><br/>We all knew Michael Keaton was gonna show up to play, so he made for a great villain as The Vulture but everything else was a bust. Outside of Peter's best friend Ned, the high school kids were worthless, in fact the entire high school setting didn't even matter in the end. Marisa Tomei was nothing more than eye candy as Aunt May, totally worthless, the connection was so superficial, it was a joke. Peter's intelligence is dwarfed by the A.I. suit he wears telling him what he should do. That's not Spider-Man.<br/><br/>Honestly, if you took out all the Marvel Studios stuff, Tony Stark, Happy, the Captain America PSAs, the Karen A.I. for the Spider suit, the Avengers, the movie cannot stand on its own as a Spider-Man universe movie. That's where Sam Raimi's Spider-Man movies win in spades and even the Amazing Spider-Man movies to a degree.<br/><br/>Yes, Tobey McGuire and Kristen Dunst may have been cast wrong in the Sam Raimi films, but everything else in that universe was perfect, even the extras. Those movies had real vision. The Amazing Spider-Man movies were worse but as far as the Spider-Man universe went, Sally Field as Aunt May, Emma Stone as Gwen Stacey and Dane Dehann as Green Goblin, that universe was in pretty good hands outside a bad script and mediocre director.<br/><br/>Homecoming didn't bring enough to the table to be a great or even good Spider-Man film, but because of all the Marvel Studios sugar coating, it passes, barely."

","The fact that they rebooted Spider-Man three times in the past 15 years is reason enough to scoff at this latest attempt at making more money off the character. But, although nothing comes close to Raimi's definitive Spider-Man trilogy (yes I liked all three), I was surprised and found this movie somewhat enjoyable and much better than the previous two (The Incredible Spider-Man 1 & 2). Except it has one fatal flaw:<br/><br/>I can see what they were trying to do here by converting Spider-Man into a wide-eyed, enthusiastic, but very inexperienced kid. The exact problem is not that he is a dork that makes mistakes and doesn't know what he is doing yet. This aspect has a certain charm to it. The problem is that the writers neutered his powers and replaced them with Iron Man powers.<br/><br/>Spider-Man is about amazing spider-like physical skills coupled with a spidey-sense and fast reflexes, coupled with a freaky biological ability to spin webs. This movie kills almost all of that: His physical skills are still there except he somehow finds them useless without Iron Man technology, his spidey-sense is nowhere to be seen, and his biological spider-web thing has been thrown out and replaced with ridiculously impossible sci-fi technology from Stark. And then, after they neuter him like this, they replace all of this with more sci-fi Iron-Man-esque magic-suit capabilites, and then have Iron Man bail him out a few times.<br/><br/>I don't understand what they were thinking. Why make a ""Spider-Man"" movie only to convert him into a silly ""Iron Man Jr""?"
"andrew2517","4","1","1","13 December 2017"," Nice on the surface, goofy on the inside.Too much effort gone to waste.
","""A guy is trying to kill Peter but hey, let's make him call him Pedro, cause that would be hilarious!""<br/><br/>I'm a big fan of Spiderman, and I was looking forward to this. If you watch this movie as a trailer, mostly focusing on the best moments, it's not bad. If you are a Spider-Man lover and have watched the originals, it's quite bad. Let me explain:<br/><br/>You have a teenager who is trying his best to get used to his powers, while having to deal with life as well. Tom Holland(Peter) is trying hard to put himself in the suit, but does not blend in so easily. Yes, he is not supposed to blend in, he's a kid, but there is no kid who would have to pull a ship together and deal with murderers and drug dealers and still not realise shit is serious. His body type does not fit much either, and his voice does not help much too, Not his fault though, he tried his best and deserves credit for it. The original movies had their goofy moments too, but not too much.<br/><br/>The action scenes are cool, but neither logical(as much as logic allows them to be in a superhero movie anyway) nor deep. A ship could no way float that way, before and after it got ""fixed"" by Tony, and noone gave a crap about the people in there. It was always about Tom and how he must grow up, yet he doesn't. Then the goofy ""interrogation"" scene with the drug dealer dude at the parking lot, and the short fights with the Vulture, not deep enough, not much sense, mostly fancy scenes.<br/><br/>Overall, this could've had great potential, but they tried too much to make it funny. Goofy and stupid jokes all the time, to make it look like Deadpool, and too much tech to keep up with Iron-Man, and sure, you can use the ""sooner or later he has them in the comics too"", but I doubt it happens in 1 hour, and to a student.<br/><br/>Marvel(and Sony too, actually) have to realise Spider-Man is a SUPERHERO, not a superhero parody. Where is the epicness of Spider-Man? Being called a girl because of his voice? That's not Spider-Man, that's Tom Holland. Where's the ""with great power comes great responsibility""? The thought that made Spider-Man movies the parent of all superhero movies after it? If not for Tony Stark, his imagemaker and manager, Spider-Man would only be found on reddit.<br/><br/>Yours respectfully."
"ritera1","7","1","1","23 November 2017"," A great deal of holes in the web
","Generally entertaining but suffered from a lot of stupid to move the story along.<br/><br/>No real urgency and threat, by and large. Just a loose conglomeration of pieces about this kid who wants to be a big-shot super hero tied with his love for the hot girl in school. No ticking clock. Good for them for not putting the world in peril for the 1000th time, though.<br/><br/>When I realized the ""Homecoming"" in the title was the homecoming dance at Peter's high school, I was ashamed for the film.<br/><br/>The action pieces were very good and nuanced. I think Hollywood finally wised up on using hand-held camera and everything was clear and my eye could follow it.<br/><br/>I really didn't think it was funny. More amusing. Holland's Peter Parker got agitating after awhile as I didn't believe he was 15. He was trying too hard. Keaton was a waste and was just hamming it up.<br/><br/>What was a disaster was the plot. It was a series of vague incidents that relied heavily on Downey and Favreau ignoring Parker's warnings and not communicating with him. Thus, they ended up with egg on their faces and were very much out of character in their stupidity.<br/><br/>If Spiderman was so important to Iron Man/Tony Stark, he wouldn't just have a few guys track him 24/7 via drone? Not like they didn't have the tech for such a task.<br/><br/>The element of Keaton selling high-tech weapons to street criminals made no sense to me. If you want to keep a low profile, those are not the ones you'd sell to. Besides, they wouldn't have the money for it. Spiderman got info from one of the street criminal ""customers"" who knew far more than he should and was driving an old Ford Taurus with the back window a piece of plastic tarp.<br/><br/>The film said ""8 years later"" after Keaton is kicked off the salvage job. He would not have developed better contacts to bigger criminals to sell the weapons to?<br/><br/>Why would you do a deal on a ferry in the middle of the water? Would that not be MORE of a risk? Granted, they needed the ferry for the action scene. But it doesn't erase the stupid move by the bad guy.<br/><br/>And they had Keaton on video BEFORE Parker encounters him at the house when he picks up his date. The Tony Stark facial recognition software could not find him on a DMV record?<br/><br/>I was also vague to what extent Keaton was stealing from the government and how easily he did.<br/><br/>And that finale with the plane? Are you kidding me? Keaton sneaks onto it in the ""blind zone""? No cameras or motion sensors on that plane. Give me a break. I thought it all might be an elaborate stunt by Tony Stark to test Spiderman because it was so incredibly stupid. But no. It was just stupid."
"AudioFileZ","8","1","1","28 September 2017"," A Pure Fun Coming of Age Peter Parker Story
","For a suspension of belief plain old fun ride Spiderman: Homecoming hits a sweet spot. It plows a field of it's own by using a coming of age story where Peter is desperately wanting to elevate his game and learning he's rushing in without tempering his burgeoning abilities thus getting in over his head. Call it a superhero's school of hard knocks Add high school puberty and young love in the mix and you have a unique slant that makes Peter as human as he is super. Stark and Peter's assigned watchdog (Happy played by Jon Favreau) ) stay largely in the shadows as it's all Peter which works wonderfully. Special mention goes to the outlaw alien weapons dealer played by Michael Keaton whose smarmy mannerisms make a perfect enemy in that you like his screen time while you hope Peter brings him down. Early on I feared it might be too much of a teen movie but I was wrong as it just built Peter's young man blues to a critical mass. The humor was just right and regular too for a truly enjoyable and fun ride. The perfect antidote for all the dark Sci-Fii out there."

","The movie was quite humorous and contained a good amount of action. It is a great coming-of-age tale, complete with love interests and a rebellious phase. It weaves in other Marvel characters without shifting the focus of the film. Only downside was that parts of it seem a little childish, but it all fit because the main character is in early high school."
"mastersparky","8","1","1","17 July 2017"," I spy a new kid on the block.
","*Contains some small spoilers* I gave myself a few days to write this review as I wanted the time to process it and to be sure I wasn't simply being swept away in the hype machine that surrounds this release. I'm pleased to say that after careful consideration I've decided that my initial reaction still stands. This is my favourite Spiderman movie so far and it also rates as one of the top Marvel films to date too.<br/><br/>Tom Holland plays the role fantastically. His charisma and comic timing, mixed with his cockiness and naivety works well. All the supporting characters perform adequately, Jacob Batalon who plays Peters best friend, provides some laughs. Robert Downey Jr. doesn't over stay his welcome and high-jack the movie as his own, as the trailers were suggesting. Michael Keaton is a solid villain as Vulture who has a genuine motive for his actions which is something that seems to lack in Marvel movies, however he is a little under developed. Also, the relationship between Tony Stark and Peters Aunt May (played by Marisa Tomei) which is teased in CIVIL WAR could have developed into an interesting side story but sadly doesn't come to any fruition.<br/><br/>The films style fits perfectly with the high school scene and is brimming with charm and playfulness. This is also the most Marvel film ever released with many references to the rest of the MCU. It cleverly uses the aftermath from the first Avengers fight as the main driving force for the story and it works well. Marvel also wisely chooses to skip the origin story, deciding to focus on Peters struggles between school life, 'superheroing' and learning to control the abilities given to him through the controversial new suit.<br/><br/>I say controversial as the suit is incredibly tech heavy and is a brand new addition to the Spiderman ethos (at least within the film universe) It's dangerously close to Iron-Mans armour and even features its own A.I. Some people like this new addition, some people don't. I personally felt it took away from what Spiderman was about and we are robbed of the natural abilities Peter should be demonstrating.<br/><br/>The special effects are what you've come to expect from a marvel production, generally great with a few issues with the human movement animation. This has become somewhat of a annoyance for me over the past few superhero films. (Doctor Strange, Wonder Woman) However there are some large scale events that look fantastic and the smaller skirmishes Peter encounters early on are great. One scene however, towards the end of the film is a bit of an eyesore. Setting the scene at night with components of a half invisible plane exploding with sparks flying everywhere renders the fight between Spiderman and Vulture a bit too incoherent for the eyes to follow.<br/><br/>One of my other issues is there's no real tension in this movie. There's no life‚Äìor‚Äì death threat. It's an issue that was inevitable for his first outing. We all KNOW he'll be in the next Avengers film, We all KNOW he's filming at least a couple more solo Spidey adventures so we all KNOW he ain't dying in this film. Also, all his supporting characters are still being developed and so killing any of them off would have been pointless. He seems to be indestructible and without knowing exactly where his limits are, you never really worry for his well-being. (even in the fakeout death scene.)<br/><br/>Overall Tom Hollands first full solo outing is a success, it has a playful, innocent and colorful feel to it and it certainly stands out from the other Marvel movies while feeling very much connected. I was entertained from start to finish and I left pretty damn satisfied. Future spidey films have to heighten the tension, and character development must be a priority but as a launch pad for a new addition to the MCU it works well. HOMECOMING finally brings Peter Parker home to the MCU where he belongs and I'm excited to see where he swings to from here.<br/><br/>For more on SPIDERMAN HOMECOMING be sure to listen to our AFTER CREDIT review, recorded upon leaving the cinema and sub to our podcast for more of our thoughts in the coming weeks."

"Fiahm","3","7","18","12 July 2017"," My Spidey Sense Is Not Tingling
","So I'm just back from seeing Spiderman: Homecoming, which I have been looking forward to for ages: I'm a big Marvel movie fan. There are weaker ones (The Dark World, Iron Man 2) and there are stronger ones (Winter Soldier, Civil War, Avengers 1) but I've been having more reliable a good time at pretty much every one of them I've seen than anything else happening in cinema this century, so I had every expectation this one was going to fill me with equal glee.<br/><br/>Right from the opening scenes, though, something felt a little off, in both tone and pace: first of all it felt like it was trying too hard to be 'young', 'hip' and 'fun' to actually BE young, hip and fun, and the end result seemed to me simply cluttered, forced and frantic.<br/><br/>Secondly, the forced diversity and heavy-handed political interjections left a sour taste in the mouth - much like Marvel's presently failing line of comics. Up till now the cinematic universe has escaped this kind of preachy, fun-spoiling PC propaganda, and it makes me wonder what this forebodes for future Marvel movies, especially the eternally unpopular Captain Marvel, which no-one wants and yet is inexplicably due to be with us in about 18 months, for no other reason, as far as anyone can discern, but that the character is female.<br/><br/>I was aware by about halfway through that the only time I had even chuckled was at a couple of the throwaway Captain America jokes, whereas I bust a gut at Guardians and Ant Man and Dr Strange and The Avengers and just about every other Marvel film. Not a good sign.<br/><br/>Other problems? Well, the showcasing of Iron Man throughout pretty much sidelines Spidey from his own movie. Spiderman messes up, Iron Man comes saves the day. Repeat. There's also way, way too much technology in it and stuff about the suit - true, that itself becomes part of the story in the last third of the film (""If you're nothing without this suit, then you shouldn't have it"") but by then we've already had to sit through an hour or more of unfunny jokes about Peter messing up in it and falling over like a clown and saying 'derp'. This much attention on the ultimately unnecessary outer garment means at times the film seems far too close to the stories of Ant Man or Iron Man himself, to the degree it can't help but actually feel derivative and old hat.<br/><br/>Spiderman was never about technology - he never needed a special suit because he already had SUPERPOWERS, but other than a generic superhero strength, none of those unique abilities (the 'spidey sense', the natural ability to stick to walls, etc) are at all on display in the film.<br/><br/>So what was good? Well, the three leads - Tom Holland, Michael Keaton and, to a lesser extent, Robert Downey Jr (who was literally phoning in a lot of it). Nothing extraordinary, and very little depth, but solid and likable acting all round. Unfortunately, all of the secondary and tertiary characters - and there are oodles of them - are as thin as tissue paper and about as integral to the story. No-one is likable, or memorable, and Peter's useless fat friend is by far the most annoying character you will see this year.<br/><br/>What else? I liked the Vulture's suit when he was flying, and some of the special effects were good, although the fight scenes at the end were cut too fast to be able to see what was going on, which kind of defeats the purpose.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a movie too intent on grabbing a younger audience, at the expense of anyone else tuning in. The liberties taken with the original source material are all to the detriment of the story, and the 'fun! fun! fun!' agenda means there is no genuine drama or depth of feeling, and hence no characters we can invest in or care about. <br/><br/>It isn't that it's a bad film at all, it's just a long way off being a good one, or even good enough."

Most notably Jon Favreau's Happy Horgan, Gwyenth Paltrow's Pepper Potts and (especially) Robert Downey Jr's Tony Stark/Ironman - used just right (and just enough) to be entertaining.<br/><br/>2). ¬†Marisa Tomei is EXCELLENT as Aunt May, fulfilling the promise that her cameo in CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR promised.<br/><br/>3). ¬†Michael Keaton is also EXCELLENT as the villain in this film - Vulture<br/><br/>4). ¬†The diversity of faces in Peter Parker's High School, most notably Jacob Batalon's take on Peter Parker's friend, Ned was a welcome site - though I would have liked more of Zendaya's Michelle and Donald Glover's Aaron Davis.<br/><br/>5). ¬†Spiderman lived up to the ""Friendly Neighborhood"" part of his title. ¬†It was refreshing to see a more ""down to Earth"" story and not some big intergalactic, global battle.<br/><br/>6). ¬†The pacing of the film - and the action scenes - were solidly directed by Jon Watts (COP CAR - I know, I hadn't heard of him either), a pleasant surprise. ¬†It also was a welcome relief that this film didn't try to ""pile on"" the villains, keeping just with The Vulture - another pleasant surprise.<br/><br/>All of this adds up to a strong film, right?<br/><br/>Well...it would...if it wasn't for one small thing that bothered me...the performance of Tom Holland in the titular role.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed Holland's take on this character when he made his extended cameo in CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR and was looking forward to him in this film. ¬†But, truth be told, his Peter Parker/Spiderman started getting on my nerves after awhile. ¬†I think a little of his portrayal goes a long way ¬† Kind of like eating a vending machine bag of Dorito's - it's satisfying, and leaves you wanting more. ¬†But try to eat a full, BIG bag of Dorito's and you get sick of Dorito's pretty quickly.<br/><br/>All in all, a good, solid addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe - and a fairly strong film. ¬†But, in this ""year of the SuperHero"" flick, it is only my 4th favorite of this genre this year.<br/><br/>Letter Grade: ¬†B<br/><br/>7 (out of 10) Stars and you can take that to the Bank(OfMarquis)"
"mikkopenttieinarieronen","7","5","12","5 July 2017"," Decent start for a new Peter Parker
","I entered the cinema having no expectations. Only thing that I was curious about was Michael Keaton, he is one of my favourite actor.<br/><br/>To me, Tom Holland is the best Peter Parker and Spider-Man presented to us in any live action -movie. It was truly amazing to watch his portrayal of a truly young teenage Peter Parker just wanting to join in to be something special, but realizing not to be ready for it yet. He had to mature up rather fast during the film.<br/><br/>I hear people complaining how this is more of a Tony Stark than Peter Parker. But while it also annoyed me a bit that even the suit was Tony's work, it kind of fits. Tony trying to be a father figure not knowing fully what he is doing, but still trying his best. However it is not clear as to why he is really ""fonded"" of Peter so much...why him. Maybe because he is as smart and reminds of himself? I just wish the default suit for Spider-Man was a bit more campy (no not talking about his self-made hoodie). Less technologically advanced. I liked the gliding-feature, and all the subtitle things. But for example the parachute was a bit much (where did it fit anyway?).<br/><br/>But I guess we live in 2017 and we can not really go back to the ""good old days"" where we do not have all the gadget stuff. Although Captain America is doing just fine with just the shield (his suit does nothing as special as Spider-Man suit?) Michael Keaton...he was shining in this. It is amazing how he keeps amazing movie after movie. The chemistry between Tom and Michael was something special. They both deserve a score for their performance.<br/><br/>My favourite scene with Michael was in the car when he realizes that Peter is...Spider-Man. His expressions truly gave shivers.<br/><br/>Although the scenes before and following showing Tom as a Peter that is truly in uncomfortable situation was also great performance work.<br/><br/>But my favourite scene with Tom was when he was stuck under the rubble. The panic he showed when being in a truly scary situation and forcing him to mature up maybe too early. By which I mean it is always sad to see someone having to mature up too young.<br/><br/>I can truly recommend this movie to any Spider-Man fan."

","Tom Holland is okay ans it Michael Keaton but that is about it. This movie was terrible. The kids in school are a joke as is the PC approach to characters. No where did Marvel ever envision Spidey this way. I guess money talks and they don't care how many benjamins are coming in. <br/><br/>If you gave this any higher that a 4, you need a full psychological examination period otherwise you are working fore those who made the movie."
"bora_mustafa","4","4","9","23 October 2017"," Is this the worst Spider-Man movie ever made? No but its damn close!!!
","Spider-Man has always been my favourite superhero and the Sam Raimi trilogy, in my opinion is still the definitive Spider-Man series, it may not be perfect but it's still the best series. I'll keep it short with the Amazing films, I did not like either film and Andrew Garfield as Spider-Man/Peter Parker felt miscast it was a doomed reboot from the start.<br/><br/>So now, we finally get to have Spider-Man within the Marvel cinematic universe as was shown in the previous Captain America movie, Civil War. This version stars Tom Holland as the web slinger, and from what I saw in Civil War, the new Spider-Man did really well, I enjoyed his comic sense of humour and he seemed strong enough to take on both Falcon and the Winter Soldier without breaking a sweat, until he faced Captain America of course.<br/><br/>With that, I was expecting Homecoming to be a decent solo movie for everyone's friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man, and for the most part it's just OK, nothing special and certainly not a movie to re-watch in a hurry. Listen, I can accept changes with the source material and I am totally fine with diversity, but if you're going to change famous characters, at least make the characters likable (the new MJ for instance) and closer to the actual character (yes I'm referring to the much younger Aunt May) and don't even get me started on the new Flash Thompson.<br/><br/>But even with these inconsistencies, there is quite a lot wrong with this interpretation of Spider-Man, if you grew up with the original animated Spider-Man series from the 60's to the 90's, then you will immediately recognise a lot of mistakes with this version. Did I like the movie? To an extent yes, it's a decent movie, but its not a great movie as many other reviewers have claimed, some have even praised it the best Spider-Man movie ever, that's way OTT (much like the overly praised 'The Dark Knight' movie).<br/><br/>While some have criticized the inclusion of Iron Man, I think he was necessary for this film and besides Tony Stark is such a great character, he provides the father figure to Peter since Uncle Ben is not even referenced in this interpretation, I did enjoy Michael Keaton's Vulture and I feel he was the saving grace for this movie overall. Now it's time to wrap this review, this Spider-Man movie will definitely keep the youngsters happy, but if you're a long timer who has watched previous movies and animated series, then you will find this movie disappointing.<br/><br/>Is it better than the dull Amazing series? I think so but it doesn't touch the brilliance of the original trilogy with Tobey Maguire."
"d-00278","9","4","9","12 September 2017"," The sweetest superhero movie
","""Spider-Man Homecoming"" is the sweetest superhero movie I've even seen. Tom Holland who plays the Spider Man looks so adorable and young that he freshens the superhero movie. Most of his troubles are little stuff only met by teens like wanting to impress the girl he has crush on and showing off his superhero identity. The villain is n't like those confronted by Spide Man and he is also a victim (His job was taken away by Stark Industries) and what he's done is just for his family, which really moves me. I really like the cool girl who seems never give a damn about anything and often makes fun of other losers including Peter Park and kinda steals Peter's thunder. Can't wait to see the next Spider Man movie!"
"lesleyharris30","9","4","9","27 July 2017"," Tom Holland Shines in a Refreshing New Take on my Favourite Superhero,
","Spider-Man: Homecoming is a terrific movie with a very well developed plot and a talented cast. We follow the suited web slinger in his fifth feature film, and the character is still fun and exciting as ever to see slinging around on screen, delivering some stellar one liners. Peter Parker is now in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, changing the dynamic of the character and the world around him, making it something refreshing for fans. It is action packed from start to finish, including a stellar sequence in Washington and a stellar finale, it had me at the edge of my seat from start to finish. <br/><br/>As a long time fan of Spider-Man, I could not help but have my gripes with this movie. First of all, there is a lack of a special connection with his audience that the Maguire and Garfield movies have. When it begins with several major characters already knowing he is Spider-Man, it can be a little less thrilling and personal, I loved how it was only Peter and us who know at the beginning of the other movies, while we get to see him revealing his secret ourselves throughout. As well as that, I was underwhelmed by Tony Stark's role, his connection with Peter was so strong in Captain America: Civil War that I was hoping for a similar one on one here, instead, he is merely around to tell Peter when he is doing something wrong, offering him advice. The back and forth between them is not as enticing, I do not blame Holland and Downey Jr. for this, as they certainly have chemistry, I blame the writers. <br/><br/>The performances are all around brilliant, the casting director deserves a big pat on the back. Tom Holland is charming, funny and dramatic when he needs to be, offering a great new take on the character that is very pleasing after two previous interpretations, he has great ease in the role that makes him a pleasure to watch. Michael Keaton shines as the Vulture, one of my favourite villains I have seen in this franchise thus far, he has some of the best dialogue and reveals throughout. Robert Downey Jr. is dazzling as always as Iron Man, Marisa Tomei is a delight as Aunt May, it is a pleasure to see Jon Favreau as Happy Hogan once again, Zendaya plays a quirky, likable character and Jacob Batalon steals many scenes as Peter's friend Ned. <br/><br/>Great fun from the beginning, a delight to finally see the web slinger in this universe. While I can not say I am completely pleased with this film, it kicks things off nicely and I am highly anticipating what is next for the character, I would recommend Spider-Man: Homecoming to anyone looking for a good action or adventure film. <br/><br/>Peter Parker tries to balance his school life with his newfound superhuman abilities. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Tom Holland"
"hiraishinnojutsu","8","4","9","10 July 2017"," one of the best spidey's performance ever!!!!
","the fact that I think Tom Holland was created by god for the sole purpose of portraying spider-man in silver screen is enough to describe that this movie is one of the best superhero (and MCU) movie of 2017 (if not of all time). Fun, entertaining, with a lot of action sequences, and the hero's struggle against all that challenged his moral value and principle made this movie fit not only for spidey (or superhero in general) fans, but also all movie lovers out there. But, another glorious presentation by marvel. <br/><br/>oh, spoiler alert! there will be a very important message by the very end of the credits, make sure not to miss it!"
"steamboy0","5","4","9","9 July 2017"," Guest in his own movie
","I'm a big fan of Spiderman and I grow-ed up with this hero's comic books along with movies, animated TV series, etc. I had low expectations for this movie cause of knowing that D.J. as Iron Man/Tony Stark will be involved in along with the already known reworked char of aunt May, they transformed her from a sweet and wise old woman to a brainless ""cougar""... But as a fan I went and watch it... Oh, well that was a huge mistake I made and truly regret it. Is a close adaptation of Ultimate Spider-man cartoon TV series, but in a worst way.<br/><br/>I don't know what's wrong with some people and film critics that rated this movie even higher than Amazing Spiderman. (?!) This movie is worst even if you compare it with Spiderman 3, which I hate most of them all. For a 10 to 16 years old kids at best it may has humor, but for ages above it's questionable and awkward.<br/><br/>The biggest fail was that they gave us a Spider-man that seemed to be a big nothing if Tony Stark wasn't mentoring and helping him along with his tech support. Also, he almost has not any super powers. He can climb walls and roofs... That's all... Oh, and he has a bit of strength... No spider sense or any other ability. The spider launcher is an upgrade add-on from Tony's tech too. Peter character has nothing... He's just a young nerd who lives with his aunt without any explanation.<br/><br/>All these things above can easily make you think that this is a superhero similar to spider-man... More like a bad caricature. Yeah, I can agree with some saying that Tomy Holland fits more as Spiderman/Peter char but I think that all good things stop there for him. Even some spider-man's cartoon TV series aren't so childish comparing to this film. They over did it...<br/><br/>Another big fail was with Flash, the known young boy that bulling Parker in school or high school. He looks like a mix of Koothrappali and wolowitz (big bang theory TV series chars). Keiton as a villain is fine, but for those that know the story of him is a big disastrous spin-off, also. The truth is that the film has so many spin-off characters and none in a good way... They ""butchered"" everything and everyone.<br/><br/>The third and not last big fail was the use of other sub-villains that in reality had nothing to do in the film. They are just there for no reason... They just fill some minutes to make this a +2h film. And I'm very sure that some of you will get a big shock with the use of 2x Shocker chars...<br/><br/>If you've not seen any other film or you don't know anything about spider-man, which seems to be extremely rare, maybe will find this movie cool. Otherwise, is not worthy to spend money to see it in a theater... In DVD/b-ray is just fine."
"Carycomic","5","4","9","9 July 2017"," I don't know if continuing to amalgamate Ultimate Marvel-verse with the mainstream is a good thing.
","Yeah, I admit Tom Holland does a good job recreating the Everyboy role of Peter Parker with the same convincing plausibility that he demonstrated in ""Capt. America: Civil War."" But, I'm not sure Latinizing the character of Eugene ""Flash"" Thomson is such a good idea. As his bullying of Peter makes him seem like an anti-Caucasian racist jerk!<br/><br/>Then, there's Michael Keaton as Adrian ""The Vulture"" Toomes. He does a pretty good job recreating the comic book version's origin (re: being an unfairly cheated small-time businessman). And making Phineas ""The Tinkerer"" Mason his techno-whiz second-in-command was an equally clever touch. But, I still didn't feel as sorry for him as I felt towards the dysfunctional Osborne family (Norman's not Ozzie's) in the Toby Maguire flicks! So, I have to rule the director's attempt to make The Vulture a slightly more sympathetic character an undeniable failure.<br/><br/>Last, but not least: who the heck is Zendaya?! And is Michelle ""MJ"" Jones going to turn out to be related to Rick, Jessica, and Angelica?<br/><br/>Combine all that with the increased swearing (only the absence of f- bombs making this PG-13 rather than R) and you have a Spidey film not even half-way as close to being family-friendly as the Raimi trilogy. <br/><br/>So, stick to WONDER WOMAN."
"arungeorge13","7","4","9","9 July 2017"," MCU Spidey finds steady footing! [+72%]
","Tom Holland as Peter Parker brings to the screen an innocent charm that renders him instantly likable. While the first two Spiderman films directed by Sam Raimi still remain one of a kind in revolutionizing the iconic comic-book character, Homecoming hits pretty close to home in terms of entertaining the viewer. <br/><br/>Treat Homecoming as a puzzle piece in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and one shouldn't have too much of a problem spotting out the various characters and Easter eggs. The writers have attempted to tell Parker's story from a fresh perspective, incorporating some of the super- villains in a highly intriguing manner. The main antagonist in this film is Adrian Toomes / The Vulture (played by Michael Keaton) who is apparently not on the same page with Tony Stark for taking over their 'city clean- up' job and putting him and his crew in a tight spot. This leaves Adrian with no choice but to salvage some of his findings and sell them off secretly on the grey market. Peter has been playing witness to some of the rather-petty crimes that are taking place in the city via the application of certain deadly weapons. He therefore readies himself to take necessary action against the baddies in order to prove to his mentor Tony Stark that he is indeed a true-blue member of The Avengers and not some random cameo-player. <br/><br/>What I liked most about the Jon Watts film is the way it strikes a decent balance between Peter Parker the high-school nerd and Spiderman the superhero. Emphasis is given to Parker's personal weaknesses and sincere efforts have been made in the writing department (that includes Jonathan Goldstein, John Francis Daley, Chris McKenna, the director Jon Watts himself and two others) to merge the figuring-out-teenage part with the larger-than-life element. Some characters seem to have gone through a modern re- imagining. Take a look at Flash Thompson for instance. This Flash ain't the hunk you have seen in the comics or the earlier film versions. What we get instead is a relatively complacent geek who picks at Parker whenever he gets a chance to. No time is spent detailing the origin story of how Peter Parker became Spiderman. This is a Spidey film that strictly coheres with the Civil War storyline and moves forward keeping in mind the universe already established since 2008. As such, we have advanced technology replacing the age-old Spider sense and slick features added to the Spider suit (customized by none other than Tony Stark!)<br/><br/>The female characters 'Liz' played by Laura Harrier and 'Michelle (MJ)' played by Zendaya are neatly integrated into the screenplay and add the much-required dose of tenderness to the film. The sidekick character of Ned (played by Jacob Batalon) gets a little annoying with his excessive mouthing of ""that's awesome!"" and ""this is crazy!"" but even he gets to redeem himself in the latter half during one of the set-pieces. <br/><br/>Keaton is fairly competent in the role of Toomes and his Vulture costume looks intimidating. Downey Jr. arrives at significant junctures in the film, both to emotionally inspire Parker and to physically help him out (erm, blame them trailers for spoiling some of the effervescence of the set-pieces!). Favreau as Happy Hogan is lively as always while Gwyneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts shows up quite late in the second half but succeeds in stealing the one scene she is in. Marisa Tomei (who still looks absolutely gorgeous in her 50s) plays Aunt May this time and nails it (wink!). <br/><br/>A horde of super-villains (Vulture, Shocker, Prowler, Scorpion) are either seen occupying solid roles or teased brilliantly for the sequels. The Washington Monument set-piece stood out for its first- of-a-kind setting that portrays Parker as suffering from 'vertigo' and concludes in uproarious fashion. The latter hour picks up pace and packs in a couple of delightful twists (one that arrives right at the very end of the film). The post- credits achieve new heights in hilarity. <br/><br/>Cinematography work by veteran Salvatore Totino is free-flowing and while music by Michael Giacchino takes a cue from Alan Silvestri's work in the MCU all the while adding his own take on the vintage Spiderman theme. <br/><br/>Verdict: Another triumph for the MCU!"
"canerom","7","4","9","9 July 2017"," It was OK
","The movie was a little flat for me nothing spectacular but it certainly doesn't deserve a 93 or 94 rating on rotten tomatoes that's for sure.

"facesofine","5","4","9","8 July 2017"," A Waste of Tom Holland's Talent
","First two thirds was awful; last third was a bit more interesting and bearable. It seemed as if the whole movie pandered to kids of today. The movie started out with Peter's non-stop, shaky video recording of his trip to meet Tony Stark...really?? Throughout the first half of the movie, he just kept whining about not being assigned more missions or be taken seriously by Tony Stark. Peter Parker was never a whiny teen nor some starstruck adolescent who couldn't control his impulses. He was a brainy kid who created and improved upon his own spidey suits. He wouldn't be seduced by any hi-tech fancy gadgets provided by Stark. Although he made the right decision at the end of the movie, which IMHO was the movie's redemption, the earlier premise was a huge disappointment. And what was the point in objectifying Aunt May with all the sexist innuendos and dressing her in sexy clothes (no offense to Marisa Tomei who is beautiful in her own right)? Speaking of Aunt May, did anyone else notice that neither Peter nor his best friend Ned actually addressed her as ""Aunt May"" and just called her May? Is this what kids do these days, no show of respect to aunts or uncles? I couldn't imagine Peter ever calling Uncle Ben just ""Ben."" These seemingly small details spoke volumes as to the degradation of respect in this movie. Shame on the writers. While there were moments that elicited a few laughs, the movie overall lacked heart and soul. It was simply a testosterone ride through the CGI world of Tony Stark. Last but not least: stay for the final scene a couple minutes into the credits, then bail out...the very end scene was a cheap trick and a total waste of time. Tobey Maguire's Spiderman movies are still the ones to beat. Even Andrew Garfield's were better. Want a thrilling and inspiring movie? Go see Wonder Woman instead."
"TheJediWay9","9","4","9","8 July 2017"," Definitely The Best Spider-Man Movie Since ""Spider-Man 2""
","""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" is the 6th live action adaptation of the popular comic book superhero and third reboot we have gotten, as well as the 16th entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Peter Parker must try to balance his high school life with being Spider-Man while the Vulture (Michael Keaton) is on the loose.<br/><br/>I've been a fan of Spider-Man for a long time. I grew up playing Maximum Carnage on Super Nintendo, and watched the original Say Raimi trilogy. I like the first one, love the second one, but when Spider-Man 3 came out it's more of a mixed bag, and the other two after that don't really count in my opinion. I can say this is definitely the best Spider-Man film since Spider-Man 2.<br/><br/>What I really liked was that this was essentially a high school teen comedy with Spider-Man. It was interesting to see Peter Parker trying to balance his life as a superhero. He has hardships in his personal life, he has hardships as Spider-Man. He wants to impress Tony Stark so that he can become an Avenger. It was an interesting way to go about things. It wasn't an origin story, thank god. How boring would that have been if Uncle Ben had died again in this reboot? We don't have to see that all over again for the third time. I'm glad they steered clear of that. <br/><br/>The Vulture was a solid villain played brilliantly by Michael Keaton. I don't think he was one of the best villains of the MCU like people have said but he was functional and fun to watch. <br/><br/>The side characters were really good, but there was one thing with one character at the end that didn't really sit well with me.

"themovieparadise","9","4","9","8 July 2017"," Finally, This is the Spider-Man We Have Been Waiting For!
","I think Spider-Man: Homecoming is my favorite Spider-Man movie to date, but it is not my favorite movie Spider-Man has been in. Let me explain: Out of all of Spidey's movies, Homecoming captures the spirit and the essence of the character the best. I don't think any of the other films so perfectly embody the Spider-Man I know from the comics. However, I do think Spider-Man 2 is ultimately a better film. So while Homecoming is the best Spider-Man movie to date, it is not the best movie Spider-Man has been in. Raimi's Spider-Man films excellently captured the tragedy of Peter Parker, and I commend them for it. But this film captured his youthfulness. One of the defining elements of his character is that he's just a teenager, and while previous films have tried to capture that, they've ultimately fallen short. Here, Peter is just a kid, and you believe it. That element of his character is done perfectly, from his high school interactions, to his crushes, to his life problems-- it was right out of the comics..."
"stevendbeard","8","4","9","7 July 2017"," Back To The Basics
","I saw ""Spider-Man:Homecoming"", starring Tom Holland-The Lost City of Z, In the Heart of the Sea; Michael Keaton-The Founder, White Noise; Marisa Tomei-Trainwreck, Wild Hogs and Robert Downey Jr.-The Sherlock Holmes movies, Gothika.<br/><br/>This is the latest reboot of the Spider-Man franchise and thankfully, there is no origin story! I think by now, everyone should have an idea about what happened, if they have seen any of the other Spider-Man movies or read any of the books. This one has Tom/Peter Parker/Spider- Man as a 15 year old High School student facing the world with the fact that he has incredible powers, but he is still just a teenager. FYI: Tom was actually 19 years old when he began filming so he is pretty close to the age he is supposed to be playing here. It also takes place right after his debut in Captain America:Civil War. Robert/Iron Man is now mentoring Tom, until he is battle ready to become a full fledged Avenger-He even gives Tom a new fancy Spider suit with all kinds of built-in gadgets. Tom's excuse to Marisa/Aunt May is that he is an intern to Tony Stark. Michael/Adrian Toomes/Vulture plays a clean-up crew leader that takes care of cleaning up after the super fights the heroes always seem to be getting into. He stumbles across some alien technology and then decides to incorporate it into some new fancy energy weapons. FYI: You get to see early versions of other villains as henchmen working for Michael. And I must say, Michael makes a great villain. He gives him depth and he is not just a bad person doing bad things. Some funny scenes have Captain America doing PSAs-Public Sevice Announcements-for the High School. You will hear the classic Spider-Man theme-'Spider-Man, Spider-Man, does whatever a spider can'-at the beginning, Stan Lee makes his cameo and there are 2 end scenes. One as the end credits start and another at the very end so don't leave early. It's rated ""PG-13"" for sci-fi action violence and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 13 minutes. I really enjoyed this reboot that went back to the basics and I would buy it on Blu-Ray."
"Prichards12345","8","4","9","7 July 2017"," Fine performance from Michael Keaton really makes the movie.
","I was delighted when Spider-Man finally came home to Marvel (in a way) and I just hope Sony and Disney can keep this amicable arrangement going for a whole series of movies. This one is light-hearted fun. It may miss the darkness of the Steve Dikto era, and indeed the occasionally dark tone of the Raimi films; but it's entertaining in the traditional Marvel manner.<br/><br/>I enjoyed Tom Holland very much as our third cinematic Peter Parker/Spidey. All of the actors who have played him in the movies bring shades of the comic book Parker to their performance, and Holland's is definitely of the comedic PP variety. It will be interesting to see his character mature and develop, and given his age five solo movies is not inconceivable for him.<br/><br/>And yet for all that and the usual stylish presence of Robert Downey Jr. it's Michael Keaton who steals the film. His Vulture is up there with Alfred Molina's Doc Ock as the best Spidey on screen villain - largely because of Keaton's layered performance than anything he's given to do - but this is Marvel's best bad guy since Loki for me.<br/><br/>Supporting cast are okay; I still find it a bit weird that Aunt May is considered hot these days. Liked Ned but was a bit iffy on the rest of the teenagers.<br/><br/>Homecoming is surprisingly grounded - no shots of Spidey swooping through the skyscrapers of Manhatten, but as we've seen this before, Marvel's approach here is a refreshing change.<br/><br/>My only real criticism is that the Stan Lee cameo was weak this time out, and so is the final post credit bit. Trying not to spoil things too much by going into detail about the plot. The Washington Monument sequence was a real standout for me. This is the best Spidey movie since Spider-Man 2.<br/><br/>And is that REALLY MJ?"

","The truth is as much as I loved the raimi take on spiderman and the first 2 where great films they where never really that close to the comics, then the Amazing spiderman movies where something I also actually enjoyed for the most part but again didn't feel like spiderman and the second one had too much filler too many repetitive scenes and felt like a jumbled mess because they where trying to use it start creating their bigger spiderman universe with the sinister six etc which seems like it ended up being a waste of time in the end now.<br/><br/>But this film surprised me, from the trailers I thought it would be a little TOO cheesy for me to enjoy and as much as it does feel like more of a kids film it was none the less a fun watch aslong as you are the type of adult that doesn't go into every movie expecting it to be aimed at that crowd, it is much more like a Marvel movie but to be honest if ever there was a Marvel character that suited the type of films marvel are making it was definitely Spiderman he is finally the wise cracking young kid he always has been and starting him off so young simply gives us time to see him grow up into the adult peter parker we have seen for quite some time over and over again giving Marvel a chance to really build the character up well without having to just force the uncle ben death on us as the only driving power behind peter being a hero.<br/><br/>It feels like a proper 90s early 2000s superhero movie and despite going in hesitant I have to admit I enjoyed every second of it, a lot of people complaining about how he was basically iron man clearly never read the comics as peter used various new tech throguhout the years in his suit and had as many varied suits as even the likes of iron man... well OK not quite that many but you get the idea, but I feel a lot of the hate is coming from people wanting some kind of Nolan batman universe again where everything is dark and moody and serious, but that was never really spiderman as a whole as its tone was very light 90% of the time.<br/><br/>Either way see it judge for yourself but don't expect anything too dark, michael keaton is a great vulture and his character can be dark at times but it never goes over the top.<br/><br/>Take your kids or if you are a real fan of spiderman from the comics go and enjoy otherwise it may be a 50/50 movie for you."
"MikeEhms","6","4","9","7 July 2017"," A generic high school movie that works as a good Spidey movie
","Spider-Man Homecoming was a solid, fun, and charming film. While it's nowhere near great I would say that it's one of the better Spidey movies. There's a lot that I like and not much I didn't enjoy. For one thing I thought Tom Holland was pretty great as both Peter Parker AND Spider-Man (which has never been done before in the movies). It's a different representation of the character since he's so young, but it works to the film's advantage since he screws up a lot as he should. There's even a few harsh moments with him that legitimately impressed me. The acting overall was very good. With my second favorite performance being Michael Keaton as Adrian Toomes. Michael Keaton is great in everything and here he really gets to shine, especially in the later parts of the movie. Only issue with him was how it sounded like he tried to have a thick NY accent early on but then just stopped after a bit. But I gotta say, he's without a shred of a doubt the best Marvel villain. Marisa Tomei as Hot Aunt May was also really enjoyable as there were quite a few funny moments around her being unnaturally attractive. The humor was also much better than I expected. It's a very light-hearted movie without feeling as tonally unbalanced as some other Marvel movies, and the quips from Spider-Man are always fun. Another thing is that the cinematography is surprisingly really good. There's a lot of great shots and a good color palette that suits the movie's tone. From a directing standpoint this movie is much better/more defined than most other Marvel films recently. Where my issues begin to emerge is mainly with the writing. This is every single high school movie you've ever seen, mixed with a generic superhero movie that happens to be about Spider-Man. It doesn't necessarily do this stuff poorly, but none of it is unique either. The romance subplot is especially mediocre. It goes through the same beats as every other one you've seen and is riddled with terribly clich√©d dialogue. It's definitely the weakest out of all the films because at least in ASM Emma and Andrew's chemistry was fantastic. And in the Raimi movies Mary Jane was fairly developed as a character. Another thing I wasn't crazy for was the emphasis on the Avengers and the rest of the MCU. Even though there were a lot of clever and meta bits where it showed how a post Avengers world would operate, it seemed a little heavy-handed. Especially with Tony Stark. I'm glad that he's not in the movie as much as I thought he would be, and I like how he's trying to be a sort of father figure. But I felt like he was the executives' way of implanting all the sequel-baiting and setting-up-for-Infinity-War into the film. Which is a negative cuz I when I see a Spider-Man film I wanna see a Spider-Man film, not another Marvel movie. My last problem is that I felt like this film really lacked much of an emotional grit to it. For the most part the sequence of events just kinda feel like a sequence of events with no real consequences. There is a scene before the third act that really held some weight to it and brought a bit of that grit to the film. There's also a little moment in the final battle where Tom Holland does his best bit of acting as he truly felt vulnerable and hurt, that with some great imagery also brought some much needed drama to it. I get that it's ultimately a kids' movie, but a good sense of weight to situation could've really made the emotional moments even more powerful. Any other issues I have are minor like product-placement, stretches in logic that the movie itself set up, and a way characters react to Peter's final action that seems out of place. Overall, I really enjoyed Spider-Man Homecoming for what it was and accepted that it's not perfect by any means; I would gladly see it again. Enthusiastic 6/10."

","Sony have not been great to Spiderman and I like others wished Marvel had got the full rights back to Spiderman a long time ago. The first couple of Toby Maguire films were good and the first amazing Spiderman was decent but the rest were awful.<br/><br/>With the recent deal between Sony and Marvel for 3 co_starring roles (cival war, infinity part 1 and 2) and 2 stand alone films (this one and Spiderman 2) it is music to fans ears and happy to say this first stand alone film is really good.<br/><br/>Unlike other Spidey films this does not go down the origins path but continues around 2 months after cival war. Tom Holland is slowly becoming a successful marvel star with his portrayal of the webbed hero the film does a great job of character building and don't expect a lot of action scenes yes there are some but not as many as you would expect.<br/><br/>Micheal Keating (first person to cross the divide from DC to Marvel) is brilliant despite his small role, where the films fails is there is just to much forced comedy and dialect, the plot and story work great and overall Spiderman is a great start that can only improve with the next outing."
"bkrauser-81-311064","8","4","9","6 July 2017"," A Victory Lap for Marvel
","Okay Marvel, now you're just showing off. Considering that every single expanded universe franchise in the last few years has been, shall we say underwhelming, every movie beyond Doctor Strange (2016) honestly feels more or less like a victory lap. Sure DC managed to showcase its ringer this year with Wonder Woman (2017) and the MonsterVerse is...umm adequate, I guess; but let's face it, Marvel isn't just the best game in town, they're the only game in town.<br/><br/>Spider-Man: Homecoming is in-fact a victory lap but it often feels like the satisfying triumphant victory lap of an underdog who has been continually ignored and undervalued. That's certainly the way Peter Parker (Holland) feels post-Civil War (2016) airport skirmish. In his mind he proved more than capable of being an Avenger yet Tony Stark (Downey Jr.), feels Peter would be best suited as just your neighborhood friendly Spider-Man. Thus when a mysterious weapons dealer known as The Vulture (Keaton) threatens the status quo, Peter decides this may just be his opportunity to prove he's a real hero.<br/><br/>Despite stunning action sequences and obvious tie-ins to the larger world of the MCU, this newest homage to Spider-Man lore is largely a coming-of-age story. One with intimate stakes that aren't necessarily world-ending but provides Peter with much needed dimensions. Many basically coronated Tom Holland as the ""best"" Spider-Man after Civil War came out - a move I found a bit pre-mature. But thanks in large part to this movie's personal stakes and honest-to-goodness great acting I'm glad to say that Tom Holland just is Spider-man. He's vulnerable, he's funny, he's haphazardly a-dorkable and in his own words ""wants to stand up for the little guy."" Speaking of the little guy, Michael Keaton's version of the MCU's version of The Vulture brings with it a certain working-man's charm. His overall MO, a clandestine black market enterprise operating under the nose of The Avengers, has all the inner-logic of a human villain existing within the frames of a fantastical world - one in which a Presidential fitness test is segued by a video Captain America PSA. It's actually kind of weird to consider that other than Loki (Tom Hiddleston), Vulture may just be the most memorable supervillain within the span of sixteen movies.<br/><br/>Marisa Tomei, Laura Harrier, Zendaya, Tony Revolori and especially Jacob Batalon all kill it as a comfortable mix of perfunctory and original supporting players. They all strike the appropriate tone, fit tightly within the confines of what the story requires them to do and seem to all be having a lot of fun playing their respective roles. And yes I say this fully knowing there'll probably be a small contingent of middle-aged comic-book fans foaming at the mouth because ""waaah multiculturalism!"" If this movie is to be taken to task on anything it's that it doesn't quite maximize its unique potential. This movie is at once the introduction of Spidey within the context of the MCU yet because we got his bare-tread intro in Civil War, Homecoming is not strictly speaking an origin story. That is arguably the most potential a Marvel movie has had to surprise, elate and invest since Guardians (2014), but because Spider-Man's valiant hero arc is so intertwined with Tony Stark's we're less invested in other things - like say Peter Parker.<br/><br/>Yet even if Spider-Man: Homecoming remains a solid start instead of a runaway success, There's still no denying it's a finely tuned machine with a couple of competently made action set-pieces, a tight story and perfect casting. It's also one of the funniest movies in the MCU and this summer at-large. A fact that at times threatens to eclipse the action with solid comedic setups and some pretty sly observations on the limits of Spider-Man's skill sets."

","Excellent movie! The real Peter Parker has now entered the stage. <br/><br/>However, I do have one nit to pick.<br/><br/>What happened to the old Spider Sense? It never tingled once. Several situations would have been helped by it. It seems like they just totally forgot about it.<br/><br/>What's the deal, writers? Did you forget a Spidey staple?"

And Young Spider- man is funny as the cartoon we used to watch. Ahh, only 90‚Ä≤s kids will know the days of Glory.<br/><br/>Plot is simple yet exciting to watch (because Spidey's Young). Here- &-there you'll catch the screenplay seeing before in Tobey Maguire's first 2 films. THANK GOD for not killing Uncle Ben the 3rd time. You know, that's the reason Amazing Spider-man didn't do well.

YOU WATCH THE 1st SPIDER-MAN WITH THEM. But, I'm very glad that Spidey became a part of MCU from Cap America: Civil War. Kudos.<br/><br/>~ Tom Holland was Great as Young Spidey. At the time of Cap America: Civil War people got so annoyed, & I don't know why. They're so Sad people. They can't handle Jokes. Literally. Let me tell you, Spidey is a character with humour. It's YOU, dumb, to think otherwise >_<<br/><br/>~ Glad to see Iron man in supporting category. And Very Glad that he was Only Supporting & not doing all the work. When an Avenger is there, director should be careful to give Justice to the Lead. Home- coming is very good example of how an Awesome Hero can also be a supporting actor.

"silverstonevero","8","4","9","6 July 2017"," A Good and Fresh Restart/Reboot
","I honestly am a big fan of spider-man. When they first (finally) introduce Spidey in CW, I was so excited and hoped to see more of this web crawler dude.<br/><br/>So here is my honest opinion about this movie.<br/><br/>Overall Marvel really never disappoint. Especially for the CGI aspects. The story line's pace are a little slow in the beginning and the humor is not as tickling as usual but it was still pretty acceptable though some part may be a little--you know--cheesy or not on grip but sure it's still entertaining.<br/><br/>Things were a little flat in the beginning but gets better even great and awesome as the story goes. And the action sequence I can give all thumbs up especially the final battle. <br/><br/>My best favorite thing about the movie is Tom Holland's portrayal of Peter Parker which reminds me of the animated version in 'The Ultimate Spiderman'. Tom really did a great job playing an 'almost' accurate character of the teenager Parker who constantly has the urge to prove himself and wants to be involved in big things. However the script did not show Peter's wittiness enough, hopefully in his next appearance it will get better.<br/><br/>The second best thing about this movie is how they gave Spidey a fresh story, which differ from the two previous version. I mean, maybe some will be disappointed but hey think about it, what's so good with a movie which story line is already predictable. Sure they need to make a new grip of it and I personally love how it goes and connected well with the MCU main plot.<br/><br/>There is no movie with no plot holes surely. But considering things like budget on cast and such it is pretty acceptable.<br/><br/>Overall it's 8 out of 9, and hopefully will get better for the next one."
"fb123","3","8","23","7 July 2017"," Mommy, Daddy, what's p-o-r-n?
","If you want to have to explain to your young child what porn is, take them to see this movie, because that is an answer a character gives to a question asked when caught by an adult (doing something else) in computer lab during a school dance.<br/><br/>There is also a scene where the girls play the ""F*/Marry/Kill Game"", so you'll probably have to explain to your young child what that is as well.<br/><br/>Yes, it's rated PG-13, but the merchandise is marketed to a far younger demographic. Parents may be tricked by that rating being related to the violence, but kids are exposed to violence and aggressiveness in every day life. Sexual references, not so much.<br/><br/>Also, Flash calls Peter ""Penis Parker"" in the movie, instead of ""puny Paker"" as in the comics. (And Flash was a jock in the comics, but is a nerd in the movie.) <br/><br/>Now before anyone attacks with ""well the characters are teenagers"", that's not the point, but the fact that these teenagers were super excited over building a Lego Death Star would suggest that looking at smut on the computer is incongruous with the type of teens that they are.<br/><br/>That aside, the movie was merely okay, but not better than any other standalone Marvel hero films; better than Avengers and Age of Ultron, though.<br/><br/>Spider-Man's CGI acrobatics were cartoonish. The suit pretty much makes him Iron-Man without the armor plating and jets; bad idea by the writers, because in the comics, Spider-Man made his own suit and equipment and it did not have AI interface. Iron-Spider suit came later on in comics.<br/><br/>Vulture is a good character, played well by Keaton, the highlight of the movie.<br/><br/>The ferry scene was pretty bad...and not in a good way."

","Pretty much this movie should be called spider-boy because the guy playing him looks and acts way too young and most things about spider-man have been reimagined here. This is ok and I have no problem with it, I left my perceptions of spider-man at the door when I watched this at the cinema and accepted that some things about the character might need to be reinterpreted for a new younger audience, but really calling it spider-boy may actually have been a better idea<br/><br/>The effects for me are not as good in homecoming as they were in the amazing spider-man which as a past collector of the comic books is the closest movie I have seen to the spider-man I know, and that movie had great actors nearly across the board. Really Emma Watson and Andrew Garfield were in a different class. I found Tobey Maguire incredibly slow as spider-man and nowhere near sharp enough (although because doc ock was so perfect, spider-man 2 is still the best overall movie). In homecoming we get the other extreme which is a spider-boy that won't shut up<br/><br/>On second viewing I don't like this movie and find it irritating. The spider-man moving eyes are stupid, most of the acting in it is hammy and bad with the exception of Michael Keaton.. the vulture is really good and it is a pity that he wasn't in one of the previous movies<br/><br/>Overall not a good spider-man movie and hopefully another reboot will get things back on track in the future"
"crazyjooster","1","3","6","9 January 2019"," They just get worse
","To start I'll say the only reason this film got 2 stars was Michael Keaton.<br/><br/>This is the worst cast Spider-Man I have ever seen (but I'm sure the next will be worse as that seems to be the pattern now). It was very poor acting and awful dialogue.<br/><br/>The Spider-Man films ate unfortunately getting worse and worse as are the Marvel films which pains me as I have been a big comic book and Marvel fan for a long long time.<br/><br/>If you are above the age of 10 this film is not marketed towards you.<br/><br/>The Marvel franchise although it started well has slowly slipped and taken certain actors with it. RDJ who I once considered an amazing actor is slipping further and further and no can only be described as a competent actor (or simply just Iron Man). I really hope Keating gets clear of the franchise."

","Spider-Man: Homecoming is a cash grab. Peter Parker and Aunt May in the original comics were so much better and offered more suspense than what they have been putting out these days. I actually refused to see any of them after Spider-Man 3 with Toby McGuire. I didn't like the direction they were taking with the story, reinventing it.<br/><br/>Peter Parker, for the same reason he wouldn't join the Avengers in this movie, is ""your friendly neighborhood Spider-man"". He isn't out for the glory or the fame. He just wants to be himself with a side job of protecting the innocent. He is your typical guy next door.<br/><br/>Instead of keeping Peter Park young, they should have let him age gracefully and let him be an ""old Spider-Man"". Hell, I could have written a better script than the last four movies. It also would have been best to let Aunt May die off so there could be flash backs of her or Uncle Ben. Instead they put a younger version of Aunt May in the movie? For what?<br/><br/>This was a fun movie and it had some fun scenes, but it was often contrived. They forced their way through the movie and it made it predictable. The characters were meh and they script was worse. I could predict after the first twenty minute of the movie, the middle and the end.<br/><br/>It isn't the actors fault. I blame the script writers and the directors.

","Marvel: Stop cramming diversity down our throats.   Escaping from the endless barrage of ""equality"", and the perpetual and  aggressive whinging of its supporters is part of the reason I go to  movies. I don't want to be made to feel guilty for being a white,  heterosexual male whilst at the cinema as well as everywhere else in my  day-to-day life. Changing the gender and ethnicity of characters just  for the sake of being inclusive is ridiculous. If there's a reason for  it - fair enough. But there simply wasn't in this case. It was done  because the current mainstream narrative is that white males are  responsible for every ill on the planet, because ... reasons. So let's  urinate all over them here, too, to virtue signal to everyone just how  progressive we are. Total crap.  Tom Holland was very good as Parker/Spider Man. I also liked Jacob  Batalon as Ned. In fact, I was pretty impressed with all of the actors  in this film. Actually, if it wasn't for the performances, I was going  to score the film a 4. My issue isn't with the actors, it's with  liberal Hollywood and their obsession with inserting a ""message"" into  every film they produce lately.  This is the last big budget Hollywood production I'm going to watch for  a while. I want to be entertained, not miseducated."

","From the Studios that brought us Iron Man, The Avengers, and Guardians of the Galaxy comes Spider-Man Homecoming, Peter Parker brand new for the third time.<br/><br/>Please remember this review is my own personal opinion.<br/><br/>I have to admit straight away, I didn't think I would enjoy this. I'm a large fan of The Amazing Spider Man series with Andrew Garfield and was not happy when I heard that Marvel had bought Spider-Man back from Sony, and would be recasting and remaking the series to fit into The Avengers universe. After really not enjoying Civil War at all, and their current movies (save GotG) lacking, in my own personal opinion, I was not looking forward to this. I went with my family, excited for the movie, and sat in my cinema seat really not happy at all. <br/><br/>However, within just a few minutes of the film, I was glued to the screen, eyes wide, laughing away and I found myself totally absorbed. The first I noticed, was that the humour was much better than in previous Marvel movies, and it was mostly relatable. He was just a teenager, excited to become a superhero, and the humour was for the age range that were mostly there to see the movie. It was well done, and a very good choice on the script writers part.<br/><br/>The cinematography was really well done; I didn't find anything I was unhappy with during the movie, and the acting was all absolutely spectacular. You can tell everyone worked really hard for this movie, and it definitely paid off; everyone was brilliant. <br/><br/>This is the standard of Marvel movies that I expect, and it reminds me of the movies back at the start of the series, long before they become the long political and not very interesting movies they have been recently. There needs to be plenty more movies like Homecoming in Marvel's future, as this was absolutely brilliant. It was refreshing, and it brought back what I personally loved about the series. This has been Marvel's best movie in a while; I hope to see more like this in the future."

In this film peter Parker is an awkward highschooler who's a part time super hero. As for the movie as a stand alone film not looking into the MCU it's okay, it's best to see it with the mindset of the movie franchise expanding rather than seeing it as a ""summer flick""."
"kosmasp","9","3","6","4 September 2017"," Disguises
","Obviously this plays in the Marvel Universe, so for a complete understanding it does not hurt to have seen a couple of other movies. Especially the Iron Man ones. But and that is important, even if this is the first one you're watching you won't be disappointed. And as you can see by the general rating, I'm not alone with this statement.<br/><br/>So taking an 80s classic and putting a Spiderman costume on it ... well you get this as a result. It's a pretty solid movie and having the blueprint of a classic injected you can see why this works. It allows for something far more than just a superhero movie. I have to admit I was skeptical with Spiderman in the previous let's call it cameo he did in the Captatin America movie. It seemed like he was belittled. Even the fact that Iron Man was going to be in this one seemed like taking away the spotlight from the man (boy) who's supposed to be the star.<br/><br/>But all of it was worries that never really manifested. Actually we have a Spiderman who walked the thin line Toby Maguire couldn't in Spiderman 3 not so long ago. Of course that wasn't entirely Tobys fault (script issues, producers influence and so forth). But it all lead to this moment, so let's take the positive ... and enjoy! Also do I have to point out there are scenes in and after the credits? The one after the credits - well let's say you'll either love it or hate it. I loved it!"
"joshfedderson","10","3","6","5 August 2017"," Spider man as he should be
","I went to see the new spider man movie today and I have to say I think out of all the spider man movies they have made, marvel hit gold on this one. <br/><br/>For one, Spider man is a kid and he was played by a 19 year old kid in this film (Tom Holland) who in my opinion gave Peter Parker justice and Spider Man too. The story was very good, and the acting really good too. This is how Spider Man should be, a nerdy kid in high school who is trying to become a hero and he makes serious mistakes along the way. Spider Man is a story of growing up and this reboot did the trick. <br/><br/>I loved the story, and the villain in this film The Vulture, Adrian Toombs who is played really well by Micheal Keaton made a great enemy to spider man. Also thought it was cool how Tony Stark/Iron Man is Peter Parker's mentor/father figure in it, who gives him advice and teaches him lessons on how to become a true hero. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I love and still love the previous spider man movies to date. But I feel ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" gave the comic books that I love justice. They tried to hard with the first three Spider Man movies, the next two were great but I feel the second one ended in a bad way. But this one went well along with the comics. Peter Parker is supposed to be a kid, and he was played by a kid. The humor in it is great, spider man is a joker and the humor went along well with that. You can tell in this one, Peter is just a kid and he so wants to be a hero and to prove himself. I also thought it was interesting that the film gave no background on peters past or how he got bit by the spider and that gave it a different twist which I liked. My ultimate favorite part is when Aunt May finds him in his bedroom with his suite on, and says ""What the F---!"" and the movie ends there, I laughed so hard. I also liked how peters best friend Ned found out, and how he became his chairman/helper in it. <br/><br/>I give a 10 for this new spidey movie, and I give a 10 to marvel for an amazing job they did at giving the web slinger justice. I know a lot of people don't like comic book super heroes but spider man is a good story with great humor and action. If your a comic book fan or not you will love this movie. I of course am a comic book fan.<br/><br/>10 out 10 for the web head :-)"
"ctowyi","8","3","6","26 July 2017"," What a blast!
","This is a blast! As usual, Marvel Studios makes it look so easy. The humour is spot-on, the character arcs so well-drawn, the action sequences so well-conceived and purposeful, and the expositions well-handled. This is not an origin story, it tells the story of how Peter Parker comes of age and becomes worthy of becoming a member of the Avengers.<br/><br/>One of the things I hate the most is watching those Defcon One city levelling destruction climaxes in superhero movies. I know I know¬Ö that's so lame because these climaxes are practically mainstays in these tentpole movies. However, when the storytelling is excellent and the characters are compelling, all these skull-numbing destruction doesn't even feature and my senses are glued to the screen. It is when the art of storytelling takes a backseat that I start to mentally count the cost of reconstruction and don't get me started on homes being flattened and families destroyed. Why doesn't any superhero movie address the consequences of superheroes using our cities as battlegrounds? Finally, someone did.<br/><br/>Spider-Man: Homecoming begins after Spider-Man's participation in a superhero gang fight in Captain America: Civil War (2016). But it actually begins 8 years prior, in the aftermath of Loki unleashing the Chitauri which made NYC their playground in The Avengers (2012). In the midst of the big clean-up, Adrian Toomes (Michael Keaton) who has secured the rights to the project got laid out by self-important bureaucrats. From that moment onwards, it isn't hard to see him becoming the Vulture, if only to strike back at the uncaring system that wipe their expensive plates with the common folk. Action has consequences. It is not difficult to see his motivation and to feel for him.<br/><br/>There is so much I love here. The pacing is spot-on and 2h 13min passed by like a breeze. The jokes hit their marks, especially those scenes with Ned (Jacob Batalon) which are a hoot. Herein lies one of the best narrative risks taken ‚Äì the identity of Spider-Man was revealed to this inquisitive geek very early on, and it opens up so many interesting turns in the narrative. The dude longs to be the ""Man in the Chair"" and he asks hilarious questions like ""do you lay eggs"". I am still smiling thinking about his affable personality and antics. Then there are the expositional scenes. I thought I needed to see how Peter Parker becomes Spider-Man. I thought wrong. The 'how' was explained in a throwaway line and that was it. It felt so refreshing. Neither was the movie burdened by having someone uttered that ""with great power comes great responsibility"" line. In fact, the movie moves like a buoyant spirit with cool narrative choices and risks taken. Even the new hi-tech Spidey suit is a character itself, but a purist would probably hate that.<br/><br/>All would be nought if the casting was off and Tom Holland just scores in the titular role. It really helps that he is a teenager when he landed the role and his tackling of teenage acceptance and wanting to become a member of the Avengers feels palpable. The stakes feel real and his learning curve is steep but a rewarding experience. Tom Holland's Spider- Man punches way above his weight. The action sequences have awesome stakes and by the time they rolled in, I was so in love with the characters I lapped them all up.<br/><br/>Every year we are indundated by giant budget superhero movies, but I suffered no superhero-movie fatigue with Spider-Man: Homecoming. This felt like home."

Is energetic, is very funny, has some very breath taking action sequences, and i think that most of Spider man fans will be very satisfied with this film.<br/><br/>Is not flawless, has some issues like, there is this one character that if i were the director of this film, i just put this character at the end of the movie and not during the entire film, because in some scenes is annoying, in some scenes this character is very funny, but in my opinion is unnecessary to have this person in the entire run time of Spider man: Homecoming. There are some scenes in this movie that there not that interesting and i was like ""can we see Spidey again? this is kind of boring"". But over all, this film entertain me and i was smiling when i was getting out of the theater i couldn't be happier with this film. <br/><br/>Go see it if you enjoy big super hero films and i can't wait to see this character in other marvel movies."

","This film tells the story of a young man who is selected by Tony Stark to be the trainee Spiderman. As he is desperate to prove himself, he runs into more trouble than he ever imagined. Soon, he appears to be out of his depth.<br/><br/>""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" reminds me of ""Deadpool"" because of its light hearted atmosphere, and Peter's mischievous demeanour. The fact that Peter is in observation and training provides a good background to the mischief, otherwise I think it might have proved to be a little annoying. Spiderman is not the almighty hero, but someone who has the potential to be. It is nice to see a cameo from Captain America, and it creates a seamless transition for Spiderman from a standalone franchise to integrating into the Marvel Cinematic Universe."

","As an avid Spider-Man fan, I left the theater feeling a little frustrated. Don't get me wrong, the movie itself was very good. Had a decent story and kept me entertained, and plot twists that I didn't see coming, but some parts really frustrated me. To start out, I'll focus on what was good:<br/><br/>Tom Holland. Excellent, excellent actor, and worthy of the title of being Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Tobey Maguire was a good Peter Parker, but not a great Spider- Man. Andrew Garfield made a great Spider-Man but didn't quite fit the bill for Peter Parker (still loved him though). Tom Holland nails both parts, and you can feel he is the same person whether he is Spider-Man or Peter Parker. There's a scene towards the end of the movie where he is trying to find strength in being Spider-Man without the suit, and it's pretty powerful. You can see he is still a kid but can carry the weight of the world on his shoulders, figuratively and literally. He pretty much is what makes me want to give this movie a 7 out of 10 rather than a lower rating.<br/><br/>Michael Keaton: fantastic villain! when starting out I thought he would be cheesy like the first Green Goblin, but towards the end he became terrifying and just a fantastic villain that you love to hate. great job, exceeded my expectations.<br/><br/>Now on to the nit pickyness....<br/><br/>There were several scenes that were powerful and emotional and what made the movie as a whole very good. That being said, there were several overly cheesy moments that were too silly and would have been better if it was kept more serious. Everyone disses on the Amazing Spider-Man movies but what I loved about them was the story line and the overall seriousness to the movies, gave them an edge that didn't make it feel so comic book-ish like the Sam Raimi trilogy. Just something felt like it was missing.<br/><br/>I am very tired of Hollywood's agenda with political correctness and forcing racial diversity. I love all people, but for goodness sake's, an Indian Flash? Really? And a black MJ who's not really MJ? and no red hair? Come on. Flash is the class bully and a dumb jock, not some skinny Indian rich prick with somewhat of a brain. And no mention of Gwen Stacy? Totally not cool. I don't care about not hurting people's feelings, I love all people, but don't add in a multi racial cast for the sake of appeasing everyone. Ridiculous.<br/><br/>Young Aunt May? Really?<br/><br/>And the suit.... Oh. My. Word. Is it a Spider-Man suit or is it an Iron Man suit? I got confused because the suit is so full of gadgets and high tech, I'm not sure who it really belongs to. Yes Tony Stark made it (which also bugs me, peter makes the suit, not Tony). The eyes are annoying, and the voice in the suit just makes it feel like it's an Iron Man suit. We already have one Iron Man, that's enough.<br/><br/>Where's the spidey sense??? Seriously, that's a HUGE part to Spider-Man's powers, why leave that out?<br/><br/>So yes. There were some details that I did not care for. But, overall, I was entertained and the big moments is what saved it for me. But I'd like to see someone else direct this movie and give Spider-Man the credit he deserves. And please re-cast some of the characters."
"pokedom","6","3","6","12 July 2017"," On Par with Deadpool
","Spiderman has been through some weird cinematic experiences in the past. I have yet to see the originals so I can't vouch for those, but I can state that Amazing Spiderman 2 is a very bad movie. Not just a bad Spiderman or superhero movie, a bad movie in general. Come Homecoming and all the advertising seemingly giving away too much, and I was skeptical for all the right reasons. Looking back, this movie is fun and funny, but some choices do seem very dumb.<br/><br/>Peter Parker shouldn't be 15, Aunt May shouldn't be hot and attractive, and Iron Man shouldn't be the source of Spiderman's power. This stuff comes naturally to most viewers. The only one I agree with however is the Peter being too young part. Different adaptations mean different ideas, so I can forgive Iron Man's involvement and Aunt May's attractiveness. But Peter is simply too young to be an Avenger in my eyes. The reason the other variations worked is because 1, he was around 17-18, and 2, he had the opportunity to save Uncle Ben, but didn't, and thus learned a hard lesson. Here, Uncle Ben is nowhere to be seen, and is never mentioned.<br/><br/>Also a lot of continuity is fairly bad. Peter just jumps a 10 foot tall fence directly after school, like right after school gets out, then walks away and no one notices. When Peter and his somewhat unhelpful best friend are tracking the Vulture, they do it... on a bus. Just in a bus with a bunch of other schoolkids and no one looks back and notices them using a hologram device with the Spiderman icon on it. There are multiple instances where Peter is just looking at people from a window in the ceiling, sometimes without the mask/hood. No one looks up and sees him, but he's RIGHT THERE! They would see him out of the corner of their eyes!<br/><br/>However many problems that might bring up, you have to remember just how funny this movie is. Lots of great high school humor, lots of great humor in general. There's one joke where two student body students are in a video made for the school announcements, and the video is intentionally made as poorly as possible. That was absolutely hilarious. There's one unintentionally funny reveal halfway through with the best Spiderman villain, objectively. Peter is having the time of his life, he's got his date to homecoming, he's getting good grades, and he walks to his love interest's door... and the villain goes ""Hi I'm her dad"". You can kinda see it coming, seeing as how the previous scenes show Peter having a good time, and it can't just be all smiles and happiness.<br/><br/>I would compare this to Deadpool as a simple good movie. While this movie has better overall humor than Deadpool, as well as better characters, Deadpool has MUCH better action, as well as meta-humor and Colossus. I would watch this over Deadpool, however this is more of a personal taste. This movie is well worth the price of admission, and is certainly better than the previous 2 Spiderman films."
"audacity10","1","12","39","3 August 2017"," Unapologetic misuse of a loved character
","Gone is the subtlety of previous attempts at stuffing cultural Marxism into our movies, Homecoming is a full-scale assault on western culture. Whether it is characters refusing to appreciate an American landmark because it was apparently ""built by slaves"", or the cast being ""diverse"" to the point there's barely a white face to be seen, this movie is communist politics disguised as entertainment - and I'm looking squarely at the writer, Goldstein, as being the first person responsible.<br/><br/>I watch movies like Spider-man in an ebbing attempt to escape this constant political assault on our society. It now seems impossible. But aside from all this, I watched Spider-man to see Spider-man. Unfortunately, they've practically changed everything that made him a good character. <br/><br/>Originally, Parker made his own suit and depended entirely on himself to navigate through the tough times, making his own decisions whether they were right or wrong. He depended on his spider-senses to warn him or help him. Now, his suit guides him, aids him and protects him. Iron Man routinely shows up to save him or shout at him, his annoying best friend knows his secret and helps him. In the end, even his (now young, hot and Italian) Aunt May discovers his secret! <br/><br/>Jon Favreau's character seems the designated angry-man when Stark isn't available to be angry at Parker. Maybe his anger towards Peter is something which could be explained by the fact he likes to hang around and meet young boys in school toilets for absolutely NO reason whatsoever...<br/><br/>The action sequences are equally weird. We see Spidey scurrying up the Washington Monument to save his friends at the top. The scene reminds me of John Cleese running towards the guards in Holy Grail, and resetting at the beginning each time he gets a little bit closer. Spider-man seems to take an eternity to reach the top and it saps all energy out of the action.<br/><br/>We also have the typical Marxist-favourite ""Jesus sacrifice"" pose as he holds together a seemingly unsinkable ferry, which has literally been sliced length-ways in half, yet stays afloat. At this point I was asking out aloud - can no one else see how ridiculous this is?<br/><br/>And that sums up this movie as far as I'm concerned. Ridiculous, slow, propaganda and I agree with Kirsten Dunst: A blatant cash grab. ________________________________<br/><br/>PS, this review received approx. 20 down-votes before I'd even had the chance to see it live. There's some very suspicious voting and reviewing happening around this movie."
"mrwayneint","8","13","44","29 June 2017"," Spider-Man Home Coming is a great Summer Blockbuster for all ages
","Spider-Man Home Coming Fresh from the advanced screening of Spider- Man Home coming, and I am still pretty hyped over how awesome this movie was. Let's just say Disney has done some justice to this character. Even though I have enjoyed all the other Spider-Man films (Including Spider-man 3 and Ultimate Spider-Man 2). The tone of the MCU is a perfect match for our young web swinger. If I were to compare this movie with any other Spider-Man film, I would say it's up there with Spider-Man 2 for sure. Tom Holland is a great fit and every character had a shining moment or two in the film. Michael Keaton, Michael Keaton, Michael Keaton! This man has single handedly saved the MCU from the dreaded villain curse. You want to talk about character development. Wow he gave a strong and intimidating performance as The Vulture. Peters best friend Ned, Aunt May, Tony Stark and even Happy the Butler all kept me glued to the Screen throughout the film. Now let's talk about the action. Very well paced action and pretty intense scenes, I mean you can tell that Peter was out of his league. Even the Shocker was pretty damn powerful and gave Spider- Man a run for his money. With MCU and the signature comedy lines it was well placed to make a pretty great summer blockbuster. The MCU does a great job with taking a genre and adding super heroes to it. For example Cap 2 was a espionage film and Ant Man was a heist film. Spider-Man Home coming is definitely a high school teen movie with a super hero twist. I give this movie 4/5 Mr. Wayne stamps for sure and highly encourage everyone to check it on the big screen. Spider-Man Home Coming out on July 7th."
"roedyg","7","5","13","16 November 2017"," mixed
","What I liked: Tom Holland is a charmer, much better looking than in still pictures. He alternates between timid everyman and smartass hero. He reminds me a bit of Marty McFly in Back to the Future. Michael Keaton was one of the best villains I have ever seen in movies. It was so fun to see Robert Downey Jr, but not nearly enough screen time. Liz is an easily believable heartthrob. She has athletic beauty and substance. What I did not like: two of the sidekicks were grossly obese. The actors talk so fast in teen slang I could only understand a small fraction of the dialogue. Most of the movie consists of unidentified out-of-focus objects being thrown at the 3D audience. That gets annoying very quickly. I kept checking my watch to see how much longer it would go on. Special effects are non-stop. It really does seem as though Spiderman has superhuman strength and agility. The effects are quite natural."

","I rented Spider-Man Homecoming recently at Redbox; at the local Kroger. The voice of Spider-Man is made to sound like he is 5 years old? This is not Spider-Man; it Spider-Child? Weird, this is not right. I know the whole long, awful; Spider-Man-Boy comic book series was made, and no one cared about that either. There is selling out and then there is selling out; and this is that and beyond into infinity. Believe me my name means infinite in Latin; that makes me a authority on the subject. This whole movie is a insult to Spider-Man in every possible way.<br/><br/>Look they need to make a long series of Spider-Man movies of the only time the whole world loved Spider-Man. That is when Todd McFarlane and Eric Larson, wrote, and drew it."

He just says he got bitten. Instead, those screen time were used on how he's seeking approval of Happy and Tony Stark.<br/><br/>In other Marvel movies, they have their own plot and Avenger comes up once or twice but in this movie, entire plot is about the Avengers and 1/3 of the movie evolves around Avengers.<br/><br/>Overall, it's just a movie setting up for the next Avenger movie. I don't even know why they cast Marisa Tomei as the aunt May as it's such a minor role. And she doesn't really fit the character.<br/><br/>I much prefer the original Spiderman with Tobey Macguire."

"itspaulsl","9","4","10","6 December 2017"," Puts previous Spider-Man's to Shame! Fantastic film!
","I do not understand what the fuss is about when people are saying they disapprove of the film. I really enjoyed it! It was a great movie, comedy, drama, events. I personally thought that it was slow to get going. They tried to overcome this with lots of slapstick/ cheap comedy to try and improve audience-character relations which, I think the lines and actions where funny but it felt unnatural and thus didn't really work. Another aspect of the film that I felt was unnatural was the casting choices. In our PC world where a film can draw negative attention on the diversity of its cast (which we all know Sony has trouble with) I think what Sony has decided to do here (to avoid this) is to balance the top heavy white cast -the fact that the main lead hero main lead villain are white- they felt the need to flood the other roles with non white cast. It felt obviously placed. I understand Sony's logic behind it: the film didn't suffer any bad diversity press so it did what it needed. I felt they could of done it a bit more naturally. <br/><br/>Putting that aside, Tom Holland is the best spidey yet! He plays confused dork very well! I would say he's not as good looking as the previous guys but I think that's partly to do with him being a lot younger. But his acting was on par, I hope he stays in the role for some time as it would be great to see where it takes it!<br/><br/>SPOILERS: (will try and keep it to a minimum)<br/><br/>For movie details, I like the fact they did the whole 'bit by the spider' in one line rather than watching 15/20 mins of it again for a third time. It was very well played out. I loved the way he got caught (both times) and as always Mr Stark flawless as ever. It defiantly was a lot better than the last lot of Spider-Man films -I felt that the Amazing spider man series focused more on drama elements but this was back to classics. It was about a high school boy and his issues and struggles of trying to do high school a social life and be an avenger in an ever changing MCU. If Thor is for the man, Spidy is for kids. I would recommend it to everyone and will be waiting for the next one."

","I don't know how many times Spider-man can be rebooted, but enough is enough. They at least had the decency to skip the Uncle Ben murder sub-plot, but still...meh.<br/><br/>While I enjoyed Tom Holland as a young PP/Spider-Man, and also some of the fight scenes (the bank scene was the most fun to me), there's too much wrong here to make it a great movie.<br/><br/>It's too self-aware to be charming. The mixed universe idea blows and needs to stop, despite the fact that Jon Favreau and Robert Downey, Jr were fine in their minor parts. There's a line in the movie: ""If you're not good enough without the suit..."". Too bad the writers didn't take that to heart in this regard.<br/><br/>And speaking of suits, way too much time was spent on the special one given to him early in the movie, which basically makes this a large rip off, err um...reference back to the first Iron Man movie. The whole idea of him struggling with it was good or amusing for a few minutes, but dear god, it goes on thru almost the entire movie and gets stale.<br/><br/>The dialogue feels like it was written by teenagers for teenagers. I felt like it made PP/Spider-Man kind of stupid and childish. Much of it was done for the sake of humor that fell flat in a short amount of time.<br/><br/>There were also some odd casting decisions. Aunt May is hot 50-ish woman instead of an old lady. Huh, what? And did PP call her ""May"" instead of ""Aunt May"" in the comics? I have no idea, but it seemed odd to me - PP has never done that in any other film iteration that I am aware of.<br/><br/>This movie also trips over itself trying to be PC, from the youth casting choices all the way to the Vulture being corrected for his use of ""cowboys and Indians"" to ""cowboys and Native Americans"". Wow, really? Or was that Sony marketing at work? <br/><br/>And why does Spidey need a sidekick? I'll leave it at that.<br/><br/>Worst of all...the Vulture is not really in it much. He also has no ""origin story"" and you pretty much see him for what he is right off the bat. Spoiler alert - he just likes to steal technology, modify it, and then steal more. Yippee. There's also a plot point about a special mask he has to wear in low oxygen areas (the creation of which is blatantly hinted thru not so subtle dialogue moments), the same physics of which somehow do not apply to Spider-Man when the time comes. For a character who is supposed to be strong in science, that seems contradictory to the character. And my common sense.<br/><br/>If future Spider-Man movies continue, they really need to take notes from the Sam Raimi versions - they were done so much better, and on so many levels. They felt more organic, and tried to develop a story better. This was all punch and little substance, as were the last two and I am tired of it.<br/><br/>Sony needs to remember: With great power, comes the great responsibility to make better movies."
"austin0731","8","4","10","12 July 2017"," The most accurate spiderman and one of MCU's best villain
","This is the third reboot of Spider man that we have gotten and after watching Homecoming I have just been wrestling with whether this is a good or a great movie in the MCU's line of films. What Homecoming does great was that it stayed true to the character more than any other rendition of Spider man, they managed to depict the awkward teenager that is Peter Parker in the most relatable and likable way. The reason why this particular Spider man is likely the best rendition of the character is because of how synonymous he is with the source material, the comic book Spider man who is constantly talking in fights, joking, enthusiastic and energetic was transferred to the silver screen perfectly. <br/><br/>Spider Man Homecoming had a much more ground level feel to it compared to any of the grand scales of MCU's other films, the film sticks to the ground and is a lot more similar to the well acclaimed Marvel Netflix shows, in an age saturated by huge action films and spectacles going bigger and bigger this is exactly the self contained and feel good superhero movie that audiences can enjoy and relate to.<br/><br/>Homecoming doesn't directly shift forward the MCU but like the Guardians of the Galaxy focuses on telling the individual character's story, Marvel is taking us back to basics where superhero franchise films don't have to be a ""Civil War"" where there are stakes that involve the entire MCU and that features an entire roster of characters. <br/><br/>But does this mean that Homecoming is a great film? My initial thoughts are that is is good but not great however after some time I think that Spider man Homecoming is in fact a great film, here's why: One thing that the MCU has been struggling with post Avengers is its villains, as any Batman fan knows, Joker is what makes Batman and this underlying lack of villains who can stand against his/her hero is sure to be something that will come back to haunt the MCU. The lack in these character's incentives is just one example of poor villains, examples include, Ronan the accuser, Ego, Ultron, Nebula, Baron Zemo, Modo, Crossbone, Dormammu, Malekith, The Mandarin. The villains of MCU are misused and underdeveloped and what distinguishes Homecoming from the bunch is its villain, I adored Michael Keaton's performance as The Vulture, a villain that on paper seems dull and in no way a match for Spider man yet they made it work. They gave the villain just as much time to develop a character as they did the hero this is what creates a balance between them and have us understand their motives which is why the vulture worked so well as a rival that can absolutely stand toe to toe against Spider man. Ultimately this factor in my opinion elevates this film and is why I think that it deserves to be highly praised."

","It was an alright movie, but it was probably my least favorite Marvel movie. One thing I had an issue with was the humor. I understand these movies would like to cater to children as well as adults, but this time around the humor seemed a lot more forced and cheesy. A lot of parts definitely seemed cheesy. I still laughed at a few parts, and I like humor in movies in general, but this was a little too much. It took away the seriousness of the film. <br/><br/>I also didn't care for the change of the characters. I think the actor for Spiderman and Vulture were great, but Aunt May, MJ, and Flash were the one's that bothered me. Only because they strayed away from who they actually are. I usually don't have a problem with a little differences, but they are drastically different from who they are suppose to be. Honestly, it's nothing to do with race, but these characters were made a certain way from the start, so they should stay like that. New characters can be different races, genders, ethnicities, etc. <br/><br/>Other than that, I thought it was a decent film. I still enjoyed it and will be getting it on Blu-Ray. Again, it is probably my least favorite Marvel film to date and least favorite superhero film this year. Looking forward to Justice League and Thor 3!"

Although it's intended to be funny through satire, SPIDER-MAN suddenly having a deep, formidable, robotic tone actually fits the costume, which is arguably the coolest, meanest and leanest superhero get-up of all time...<br/><br/>Not that Tom Holland is a weak SPIDER-MAN. He's a good one. And a good actor. Sympathetic. Energetic. And while it's difficult if impossible making any high school student seem like a geek nowadays when everyone carries a personal computer/phone in their pocket, he fits the mold of an underdog who's hiding a secret while getting no credit for his accomplishments...<br/><br/>Which are intentionally rare in HOMECOMING. Having surpassed the field trip spider-bite origin story (it's been done twice already), there is a beginning since Peter Parker's not quite ready to be a hero of the Avenger (or any) magnitude. That aspect overrides a practically nonexistent plot having to do with former DC Protagonist turned Marvel villain Michael Keaton as The Vulture, based on the long-ago comic book and cartoon character, who should have been deemed The Junkman given his own particular origin that opens the show...<br/><br/>As a blue collar scrap collector... once the government moves in to clean up the mess from each Avenger battle, he makes the best of what he's already gathered-up, and has a lot of cool stuff that's being sold illegally; and after eight years of mysterious (and unrealistic) anonymity, Peter Parker's on his trail...<br/><br/>Which is more of a beeline, and only partially interesting given the lack of urgency to carry the story forward. Made up for by an incredible 11th (or maybe 10th) hour twist that ignites two rivals against each other in a great way, and the real action begins albeit quickly heading towards an inevitable conclusion... <br/><br/>If only that turning point occurred halfway through instead, Peter's large, nerdy sidekick wouldn't need so many forced one-liners (dude, we get it, you're endearingly flawed), and this HOMECOMING would be more of a high-stakes 15- Round Matchup instead of the Exhibition Bout that it is ‚Äî which isn't too shabby: After all, a fight is a fight in the Marvel universe, and always fun and cool to watch/experience. But since in any superhero installment (or even a James Bond flick), the easiest way to describe the overall plot is by simply asking, ""What does the villain really want, and need?"" Well, after two long hours, it remains a mystery."

","However colourful, witty and truly entertaining Spider-man Homecoming was, I felt that it was missing something vital when compared to its predecessors. Perhaps Marvel was trying too hard to make this movie different from the previous installments, but the characters felt watered down and almost boring. None of the relationships that are supposed to define Peter and help us empathize with him are there. Instead, characters like Flash, May and even his best friend are used for setting and comedic relief. Next, there was much too little context for Peter's life. I don't need a whole 30 minutes dedicated to a new take on the origin story, but without any background, this version of Peter Parker comes across as a bit bland. He's basically just a regular kid with a good moral compass. My last point is purely opinion regarding the role of Tony Stark. Yeah, he's an awesome character, but he played what was literally the biggest safety net I ever saw. Spidey's whole shtick used to be about him learning the ropes himself through trial and lots of error. Now that he has this mentor character to wipe his butt, Peter comes across as something of a whiny, reckless kid who just stumbled into his rebellious phase. Anways, overall, pretty solid movie with cool action sequences and a satisfying plot. Tom Holland made a pretty good Spider-man ass well.

As much as i love Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield as Spider-Man/Peter Parker but both of them has flaws, as Tobey make a great Spider-Man but bad Peter, and Andrew make a great Peter but bad Spider-Man, but this case didn't happen with Tom as he make both great Spider-Man and Peter at the same time and i'm really grateful for it.<br/><br/>I can't help but notice the more vibrant color of this movie, Marvel somehow managed to get this one right unlike the previous Marvel movies that looked a little bit dull for my taste, this one is more pleasing to the eyes.<br/><br/>The Casts selection was fresh and it is good although not great, but each one of them played their character really well.<br/><br/>A few nods both to the comic or previous movies that brings out the inner nerd in you<br/><br/>The humor is good, even though some are a little bit cringe worthy and unfunny but overall it is what you expected from the comic book<br/><br/>Now let's go with the bad news<br/><br/>The story felt like it was written by a 12 years old, it really feels light and doesn't have weight to it whatsoever, it is seriously disappointing, it felt like they only shows us a series of random events just to fill in the 2 hours mark.<br/><br/>And it doesn't ends there, there's so much thing that didn't make any sense and there's a few examples of it one of them being the Washington Memorial scene which Spidey is suddenly afraid of heights even though swinging from tall building to tall building was almost like his everyday meal.<br/><br/>The fight scene lacks realism, sure you could argue about this being a superhero film that supposed to be far from how the real world works, but compared to previous movies this one really lacks it, evidence being the climax fight with Vulture when he was buried in rubble, falls from great height, punched by a steel fist, got thrown here and there and he somehow survives with barely any bruises, no cuts, and no tear from his suits.<br/><br/>Some of the character was underdeveloped and The Shocker appearance is disappointing he was almost felt like an extra and doesn't have that atmosphere of him being one of the main villains in the movie.<br/><br/>Overall i kinda feel bad about this movie, it has it potential but end up with many flaws and a few good things to barely redeem itself"

","This movie is only for kids . This movie is quite funny but also a long running and no good action is there. So after a while you will get bored. This movie has very little action. And little bit of comedy. All over it is a talkative movie. Kids and teenagers will definitely enjoy this."

","---minor spoiler-- Look. the kid is supposed to be intelligent. he makes is it to a national academic competition. but then we see him ditch his date during a party because he has to stop a bad guy from leaving town. this cannot wait for 30 minutes, this cannot wait for the end of the day. They guy has absolutely no reason to be leaving the city where he has his wife and family. <br/><br/>I was looking forward to this movie, but didn't really like. It seems the suit makes Spider-man rather than the opposite. I don't like how peter Parker is so needy and irrational."
"RamonThomas","4","3","7","21 April 2018"," Go home Spiderman
","This is the absolute worst Spiderman movie ever made. The main reason I dislike it so much is Tony Stark giving Spiderman his suit, which breaks the rules. In all comics and previous movies, being a smart student, he develops his own Spidy suit. This is a bloated attempt to connect him into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. And these films will never compare with the Tobey Macguire triligy."

","My son left the room before this began playing, and evidently had more spider sense than the main character (and given evidently Iron Man had to make a special suit for Spidey to have the capability, I'm even more right). Didn't understand the need for the PG13 rating material (the utterance of ""Asshole"" in the early minutes seemed unnecessarily dark, and that darkness failed to really carry forward which would have targeted the movie to a certain demographic. They could have kept it PG-safe, but as the rest of the movie played out, I realized the identity crisis this movie has.<br/><br/>Keaton/Holland, good actors doing the best they can with an otherwise flop. LONG running time trying to no avail to create something...anything. <br/><br/>So perplexed by the plot and attempt to disconnect from the historical character's background...why an Iron Man-ish Spiderman suit with hundreds of web shooter options? Don't get it."
"SquigglyCrunch","6","3","7","6 September 2017"," Conveniences and Fun
","Spider-Man: Homecoming follows Peter Parker as he attempts to take down an organization in his city to prove to the Avengers that he can be one of them. <br/><br/>Unlike in the previous Captain America movie where I found Spider- Man immensely annoying, in his solo movie he actually proved to be quite good. It's clear that he's putting a lot of energy into his role and having a lot of fun with it. His character is pretty eccentric, and seeing him being able to pull off this character in a solo movie is really refreshing. Plus the writing for his character is a lot of fun too. He's a nice, younger break from the other movies. <br/><br/>The movie as a whole is a lot of fun. The other actors are good and again, clearly having fun, the action sequences are fast and entertaining, it's all a good time. The only problem with this fact is the lack of stakes. It never seems like Spider-Man is actually in danger, there's always some convenient thing there to make sure nothing bad happens. The amount of problems Spider-Man actually fixes himself are incredibly small next to the amount of plot conveniences. Something bad will happen and immediately be fixed by some convenient, semi-connected to barely connected thing. It was too convenient to believe on multiple occasions, and I just didn't dig that. <br/><br/>There was one scene in the movie, closer to the end that involved a major villain and the love interest that I knew was supposed to be super intense and serious, but I just couldn't help laughing the entire way through. It felt like the movie suddenly became a sitcom for those ten minutes. The scene was totally out of place and so clich√©d to the point where the audience can't actually predict it. It's a clich√© that's been done to death, so most filmmakers know not to include it in a movie anymore. I'm not saying it was a bad twist, but it sure was a funny one. Where my problem with this scene really lies is towards the end when a character comes to a realization about something. It's as if the writers didn't know how to start wrapping up in the generic Spider-Man way and just went with some half-developed way that really doesn't make a lot of sense. <br/><br/>Overall I had a lot of fun with Spider-Man: Homecoming, but that doesn't make it a great movie. It's immensely convenient, lacking tension or stakes, at one point becoming too silly when it's supposed to be serious and at times sacrificing realism for rushed plot progression. Other than that this is a perfectly disposable, turn-your-brain-off action comedy to watch with a group of friends on a rainy day. In the end I would recommend it."
"MeBeiM","6","3","7","5 August 2017"," A little bit exaggerated, to say the least
","I'll just start by saying I've never been a great fan of superhero movies, but I do actually like Spiderman.<br/><br/>This movie didn't really surprise me that much: I already knew I was going to see Tony Stark, I already knew I was going to see the classic ""I have a crush on the prettiest girl in the school but I'm a nerd how can I impress her"" secondary plot, and I already knew that there would have been some fairly unrealistic scenes (after all it's a Marvel movie).<br/><br/>With that said, I liked how the whole movie was directed, I liked the random funny lines and scenes here and there, and the plot itself was good material. It makes a pretty cool movie... but... but there are some details that I just couldn't get off of the back of my head, and kept annoying me through the entire movie.<br/><br/>First of all, the villain: how can a group of workers, all of a sudden, decide to stop doing whatever they are supposed to and instead manage to build futuristic tech which nobody has ever seen before exploiting never-before-known alien artifacts in the blink of an eye? That looks a bit too odd and unrealistic to me, but OK, that's pretty much the standard Marvel villain backstory so I can go with it.<br/><br/>Secondly, let's talk about Spiderman (not Peter Parker, not the actor, just the character): that suit built for him by Tony Stark is so damn cool that it actually doesn't even need a human with a functioning brain to work. Anyone who wears it could possibly become Spiderman, not to mention that the integrated artificial intelligent assistant already has a brain of its own. The character of Spiderman could basically be a mannequin at this point, the only thing that barely makes a difference is his super-strength.<br/><br/>Third: what the hell is going through the Avengers' heads to leave an helpless fat driver (or whatever the hell he is supposed to be) to handle the whole head quarter and all their stuff while they're moving? Also, why the hell do you have a ten-billion-dollar-futuristic-stealth-AC-130 equipped with anything you can possibly think of if you can't even manage to notice a metal bird the size of an elephant landing on its back trying to steal all your stuff? Come on Tony Stark, are you serious? You have push notifications to alert you if a 16 y/o boy in a jumpsuit goes out of town for a school trip and can't manage to take care of ten thousand tons of steel flying over NYC? Ooooook.<br/><br/>Last, but not least, Ned is a pretty funny guy, but you don't become the ""guy in the chair"" in the blink of an eye and start doing all kinds of hacking on two high school computers running Windows 95.<br/><br/>Moral of the fairy tale: Parker gets to catch the villain, keep the super cool Spider-Man suit, conquer the heart of his crush, and ... oh wait... does he actually? Nope, he doesn't. Well, what did I expect after all: he just ditched her at Homecoming and got his father arrested so that she's now moving to a different state with her mother, of course nothing's going to happen. Sigh.<br/><br/>I think the movie had a lot of potential, and I can see why the average rating is 8/10, but I don't really think it's worth more than a 6. After all, the only thing that wasn't that much predictable was Liz moving to Oregon."
"rockman182","8","3","7","27 July 2017"," Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017)
","At this point its almost impossible to deny that the Marvel Cinematic Universe is a money making vehicle. While I'm not overly fond of some of the MCU films, others are just a complete blast. I think we are in Phase 3 of the MCU now with this film. Its the second reboot of Spider-Man after The Amazing Spider-Man films failed (I'd say pretty miserably as well). The main concern for this one was having to re-hash the same type of introduction once again. Luckily having the character be a part of Captain America: Civil War was a great way of just taking off in a good place with the Spider-Man character.<br/><br/>The film shows a young Peter Parker in high school and is able to focus on all aspects of his superhero and personal life. On one hand he likes a girl in his school named Liz and wants to go out with her. On the other hand, Peter has to get used to his new role and uncovers a dangerous plot by the Vulture (played by Michael Keaton). And lastly, Parker is also trying to impress Tony Stark/Iron Man and wants to help advance his role with The Avengers despite getting himself into trouble many times.<br/><br/>Tom Holland works very well as a young and exuberant teenage Peter Parker. He has the right amount of charm to make the character work. There's plenty of humor in the film as is common with MCU films. Keaton (who seems to like playing winged figures) is pretty great as Vulture. He has the skill to bring the right amount of menace to the character. A strength of this film is not having to retrace an origin story that has been done to death. We were luckily able to just skip over Uncle Ben's death, Peter getting bitten by the spider and all that jazz. This was a great idea. The film was able to just move right into not only getting us acclimated with the character but also push forward his relationship with Iron Man and the Avengers.<br/><br/>The inevitable question comes. How does this rate among the other Spider-Man films? I think Homecoming is miles better than the awful Amazing Spider-Man films. Its also better than Spider-Man 3, but I think it falls just short of the original two Tobey Maguire films. Through no real fault of its own. Its a long film for sure but does just right of getting the character back on track for the future of the MCU. Its harmless fun.<br/><br/>8/10"
"gangstaroute","7","3","7","10 July 2017"," Where is the heart and soul? *Contains Spoilers*
","WARNING: This review may contain spoilers so reader beware. <br/><br/>This review is based on my personal review of the movie as seen in the theatre. <br/><br/>First off I have to say the fight scenes and acting in the movie were good. I have no qualms about how Tom Holland played his spider man role. He played the kid feel of Spiderman very well. Also we all know Robert Downey Jr., plays his role on point as he has been around the block more than a few times and his role of Iron Man has been consistent since day one. I absolutely hate when an actor plays a the main actor/hero and they get switched like used socks, (Transformers, Spiderman, etc), it absolutely takes any relation and connect with the character in the movie and stomps on it. Tom Holland played a very humble Peter Parker and interacting with the environment of the movie very well. I also enjoyed how they put Stan Lee in it as well. It was funny him playing a senior yelling from his apartment window. lol. What I don't like about this movie, and many others, is:<br/><br/>1. The characters get switched around so damn often. Like there has been what, like 3 or 4 different actors that have played Spiderman, like where is the connect with the actor and his character? How can you get involved in a superhero movie franchise when every new movie that comes out a different Character is playing him? Honestly I enjoyed when Toby Macguire played him because he was just the original OG, like the first one and should have stayed that way. <br/><br/>2. Its always the next movie you hope is going to tell a true, comic book like style episode. Not welcome to this and here is your new suit, and don't go all out yet your just learning etc, etc. Its always him a new character learning the ropes and it never feels like it is a true spiderman movie. It feels like he has been welcomed to the Avengers like a million times already and he has been in an Avenger movie already but this one shows him just joining? Then at the end not only does he change his suit every movie, but he had three different variations of costumes just in this movie alone! Like didn't spiderman get over his prototype like ages ago? Then Tony Stark gives him a new suit to use, and at the end, builds him another some sort of new futuristic Iron Man/ Spiderman suit yet again. I thought he had a good new suit like 3 movies ago yet he always starts the movie out with another damn prototype to get a new one at the end. Like where are all these new suits going? Anyway, the next movie it will probably be a different actor and the suit that was showed at the end of this movie will 'disappear', in a shroud of mystery, never to be seen. Like why all of a sudden is Tony Stark the provider of his costume, like when did this come into play? When did Tony become his guardian and basically grounding him from being spiderman because he says so? Didn't Spiderman create his own suit, destiny?.. pfff. smh<br/><br/>3. There is no backbone, heart, or soul to this movie at all. It always feels like a remake of the first movie out. Spiderman starting from the bottom yet again as a new actor. I want to see a spiderman full of action, like the comic books. I already know the story of superman, i know the group he hangs with, I know his roots, yet every movie feels the need to explain the story all over again, every damn time. Its slow and boring for like half the movie and the action doesn't start until like half way through. By this time I think that we should already have a spiderman thats full of action, comic book style, not some boring story thats been explained like a billion times. Like who doesn't know spiderman. Seriously. Watch the first movies if you don't know. <br/><br/>4. I felt the movie was almost more about the Avengers than it was about Spiderman himself. They managed to save it and put it in spider-man's favour but it felt like Spiderman wasn't even able to be the star of his movie because 'THE AVENGERS' said he couldn't. Thats like Superman telling Batman he cant save Gotham city because Superman defends all. lol. Anyway if a movie is about one superhero in particular it should be about the superhero not about his trying out for some other superhero squad the whole movie. <br/><br/>Anyway, thats what I found to be a pain for this movie, along with the one before as well. The things I really enjoyed were stated earlier. I enjoyed Tom Holland in the role. I thought he did well in playing the innocent kid that Spiderman usually is portrayed as in the movies. He seemed humble and respectful, ready to jump at a moments notice to help anyone.I thought Martha May looked extraordinarily young, like sh**, almost a model looking girl. Isn't she supposed to be an aunt to Spiderman? Anyway this movie I believe was thrown together with not much heart or effort to connect it to the true spiderman, but just thought with CGI, big explosions, and creative character thinking they could pull off a good spiderman movie. Nope. Wasn't my liking and definitely didn't compare to the original ones."
"NDbportmanfan","7","3","7","10 July 2017"," An Okay Attempt at RE-Rebooting the Franchise
","Spider-man Homecoming changes up the formula compared to the previous two Spider-man attempts. This time around Peter isn't just getting his powers; he has had some actual experience with them. There is no longer an Uncle Ben moment as Tony Stark takes over that role. There seemed to be a lot more humor in this movie than the other ones which I can accept given this is a teenage Spider-man who is pretty naive to the magnitude of the situation most of the time.<br/><br/>What this movie lacked at least a good 3/4 of the time was a real story. Spider-man kind of just bounced around giving jokes here and there. We had I think four noteworthy villains but really one was given any significant dialogue. Vulture was a good villain and I liked the whole concept of the character's purpose but I can't say he ever had me worrying for Peter. Besides Tony just seems to be able to swoop in whenever to help out when things get tough which further lessens the stakes throughout the movie.<br/><br/>The one thing this movie has going for it is the fact that they chose Tom Holland for Spider-man. This guy is charming as hell and can really deliver serious and comedic lines with the best of them. He basically had to carry this movie as the direction of this movie was really not one of Marvel's best. The supporting high school cast did well for the time they were given. I find it funny how they were advertising this as a John Hughes type movie, but I have not heard that mentioned once since the release. This movie doesn't focus on the school side any more than the Amazing Spider-Man movies did and neither were really that impactful to their respected stories.<br/><br/>Now how does this movie rank with the others? I think the Amazing SM movie were okay but they had a lot of cringe moments. The best thing had going for them was Peter and Gwen but that is about it those movies along with Spider-man 3 rank below this movie. I did find myself enjoying Homecoming but I can't say I would watch it again anytime soon. Spider-man 2 seems to still be the gold standard.<br/><br/>If you want to see an entertaining summer movie that visually looks great and will have you laughing from beginning to end then check this out. I would still however recommend Baby Driver over this movie though."
"yannigk","7","3","7","10 July 2017"," A fun teenage coming-of-age movie
","I think I might've put my expectations a bit too high, the film feels a bit standard for marvel. It is up to par with Dr. Strange, for example, but not as memorable as.. er.. I guess Marvel's standards are pretty high. This one feels more down to earth. Spiderman fights his villains on his own, and so isn't bogged down by the large scale and heaviness of films like the Avengers. I particularly liked the opening scene with Peter Parker making a little video diary, with some scenes from Civil War in it. Totally what a 15 yo teenager would do. <br/><br/>Tom Holland, as he did in his appearance in Civil War, is the perfect Spider-Man (and I'm a Tobey's version fan), and Tony Stark makes a pretty good mentor/father figure. I like that they only mentioned the fact that Peter lost his uncle just recently (we don't really need another spider bite and uncle death story). I wish there were more Aunt May scenes.<br/><br/>Even though the general feel of the film is upbeat, I have to say that Tom delivered his rare emotional scenes perfectly. You feel his loss when he fails to be what he wanted to be. He reminded me of his excellent work in ""The Impossible"" (must watch). <br/><br/>The changes in this version of spidey takes him to a completely different universe. He still lags in school due to his ""other"" responsibilities. But now he's the smart science nerd with his smart IT nerd friend, not the reporter-to-be kind of Peter Parker (I still remember Tobey's Peter taking pictures of MJ when he got bit). His suit and abilities are a bit different and mostly made by Stark, and I think spidey fans didn't like that idea. And I'm not sure I like the in-suit AI either (even though she sounds so soothing... it was Jennifer Connely's voice). But on the other hand it was pretty cool to see the different web effects the suit enabled him. <br/><br/>Michael Keaton as the Birdma.. I mean Vulture.. he's menacing and vicious when he needs to be. Excellent play between him and Peter Parker. <br/><br/>It's good. Fun, light, with some emotions interspersed throughout. The only bad thing.. well.. it's every other marvel standalone movie (well that's not bad actually because most of them are good too) and I guess we've seen those before."
"gabb-88321","6","3","7","10 July 2017"," Should've kept Andrew Garfield
","I do not understand the praise for this movie. People just love it simply because it's Marvel. <br/><br/>The jokes are forced, as usual, although some are fine. But for a movie like Spiderman I get the needed humour. <br/><br/>This movie was very diverse, which is not terrible. However, when you cast a 5'6"" actor to play Flash who is supposed to be intimidating and dominant. The effect just is not there. Peter basically looked down on him. The actor from The Amazing Spider-Man was a prime example for what a generic bully should be. They tried too hard to be clever with the character but his character is not meant to be taken like that. No offence to Tony Revolori. He just didn't capture the douche facade. <br/><br/>The Villain: I understood how Vulture had a reason for turning out the way he did. His motive wasn't forced or impractical at all. It's just that there was no transition for his character to develop. In the beginning he seems like a light hearted business man, then suddenly punches a man who he rivals with. There was no build up to his transformation, it felt like there were scenes of him left out. In a 2 hour and almost half movie you'd expect some substance to him. Of course after 8 years he would have changed but it was off camera which seemed rushed. Other than that he was a plain villain. <br/><br/>The entire plot was too predictable, each act was so generically timed that it felt like you've already seen it. The action was so boring that I was waiting for the final fight to end and not even enjoy it. There are some good things about the movie. Peter, Michelle, Liz, Aunt May, Ned were decent. Stark was a good addition to it, he actually served a purpose. Effects were good, Score for the movie didn't excite me too well, much prefer the originals or Andrew Garfields version. <br/><br/>Another stupid thing, the inclusion of Pepper when she hasn't been present in previous movies where you'd expect she would. She just shows up, not even a mention during the movie."
"banosd","7","3","7","10 July 2017"," Might restore my interest in super her genre
","Although I am generally sick of comic book movies, I gave this a chance because my son wanted to watch it.<br/><br/>It has a good villain in Michael Keaton, whose Hollywood comeback keeps gaining momentum. Despite his intensity, you could see he was also a victim of circumstance. <br/><br/>The new Spiderman was good. Tom Holland is much older than the teenager he is playing, as is the rest of cast. His portrayal is down to earth which seems to be a trend in the superhero movie universe. What was nice to see were the action scenes without the suit. He seemed more like a regular guy who inherited super powers.<br/><br/>I don't think this was groundbreaking in any way, just a good action movie and a more interesting Spider Man than the last two. I was impressed by the nerdy classmate portrayal by music star Zendaya, too."
"najeebullahyasir","7","3","7","8 July 2017"," Fun.
","The plot was OK. The only thing that was bad about the movie was that the powers of peter Parker were mutilated. To be more precise he is dependent on a suit for his powers whereas in the real comics they are 'within' him. I found it better to have a funny movie than a more gloomy story where the plot moves slowly. That was visible when Vulture predicted that Peter was spidey while in the car. In more typical movies its just forever. The CGI all along was good. The sequence of events was perfect. I hated that Manuel all along because he was unnecessary, bad at acting and cringe throughout. Loved Michelle, obviously Lin and iron man. In all the plot wasn't that 'bad' and the time i spent was worth it."
"sebastiansallingkierkegaard","8","3","7","8 July 2017"," One of the best in the series!
","Spider-Man: Homecoming is another take on the spinning spider hero. It is unique in it's own way. The first made by Marvel Studios. Tom Holland is probably the best Spidey in my opinion. It's the first teen Peter Parker impression. He looks pretty much like the Spider- Man from the comics. Michael Keaton has finally both played in a DC film and a Marvel film. He did a good job playing Vulture if you ask me. Great humor, maybe some action stolen from the previous films, but in the whole all it's a really great superhero movie. <br/><br/>The scene that shocked me most was the scene where it is revealed that Vulture is the father of Liz (Peter's lover). Keaton really puts work in impressing a father which needs money, but has to take the hard way. The only things that matter is family. Peter is threatened by Vulture because he finds out Peter is Spidey. But Peter don't listen to him so he tries to destroy his plans. And then he smashes rocks at Peter and this is probably one of the best scenes in the film. He rises and gets himself saved. The last scene when Peter says no at joining the Avengers is also a grown up decision. But the final scene when aunt May finds out he's Spidey is hilarious! <br/><br/>I give Spider-Man: HomecomingüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ"
"residentgrigo","8","3","7","8 July 2017"," A successful reboot that strays from the comics
","Iron-man: Homecoming first of all nails the ""Friendly Neighborhood"" hero from Queens feel. It's also immaculately directed, features the first good version of the Vulture and every single actor was great. Where the film struggles somewhat is being a coherent adaptation of the comics. Peter is half Ultimate Peter, half Miles Morales and half Iron-man's sidekick striking out on his own. That's all a bit much! ""MJ"", Flash and Aunt May have nothing to do with any comic counterpart either and i 100% fail to comprehend why the film can't have 5 minutes devoted to his origin. This is a reboot targeting a new audience and they are now missing Spidey 101 canon. I don't get it. The film is obviously a success and not another Amazing 2 mess, as the crappy trailers suggested, yet it's not much of a comic adaptation and more of a radical reinterpretation. That is why this film will always come behind the highly comic accurate Sam Raimi original and obviously it's borderline perfect sequel. Still, Sony + Disney did good and successfully rebooted their golden goose and that's all that matters.<br/><br/>One question remains though: Who though that the now 21 year old Tom Holland could pass for a 15 year old? Can we please get Spider-MAN out of high school within the next solo film, as that period only lasted for about 2 years in the comics!"
"Thekeybaldemasterrises","8","3","7","8 July 2017"," It has some studio problems but it ended up being a great Spidey movie!
","This movie is a solid entry into the MCU(or is it?). Tom Holland I thought couldn't get any better than he was in Civil War but he blows all expectations. He has to be the best portrayal of Spidey so far. He captured that innocence and comedic timing that perfectly sums up who Spider-Man is. His arc mirrors Tony Stark in a way of the whole ""does the suit make the man"", but it surprisingly still feels emotional enough and works for this movie. We've never seen the character exist in a larger world on film before and to see him grow as his own hero is a nice spin on the story. We don't have to go through the origin or Uncle Ben's prologue again but it rather takes time to focus on the most important aspect that both the Tobey Maguire and a Andrew Garfield films just gloss over. That he's a kid. He's way too young to be doing any of this but he does, and you see him struggle with that. In that sense it doesn't feel like a movie we've seen before . I just have to say too this movie is really funny. It utilizes the MCU connections well and gives a lot of fun opportunities for the writers. The story is a great start for the character, becoming apart of this larger world we know through the MCU, it's a throwback to the John Hughes genre of teen films and you totally believe that's what they were going for. Having Iron Man be his mentor in the background of the movie was a smart move and including Downey along with Faveru was fun as it should be. I was really excited to see Michael Keaton as Vulture and I was mostly satisfied. I liked the way his character was introduced and I do believe he's one of the more interesting Marvel villains so far but I almost wanted more time with him because of that. Hopefully it's not the last time we see him. This movie is solid overall and I absolutely think it's worth it for the third time rebooting him, you should definitely go see it. But wait. There are some problems I wanted to share. On a filmmaking level the biggest thing for me was pacing. The movie starts off so great, and then slows down a lot in the second half. There's a point where it feels like it halts and it doesn't really need too. On a casting level this is where the movie started to take hit points for me. The diversity in the cast is reallyyyyyyyy forced. The actor playing the friend is fine, and Zendaya is surprisingly funny, however the actress playing Liz and the actor playing Flash stuck out like a sore thumb. She was serviceable but not memorable which is not something you don't want out of your female love interest in a Spider-Man movie. And the actor playing Flash does a good job but he misses the point of the character and it just doesn't make any sense why they made him Guatemalan. It's very obvious they're trying to appeal to every market they can and it makes me question who was really making this movie? Sony or Marvel. My guess is Marvel was told to limit their participation on the movie but all the good stuff was on their part. However this is my BIGGEST issue with the movie and why I fear for the future of this franchise. It seems to step backwards to Sony's safety net. They shadow a lot of moments from the Rami films and I'm dying for someone to upload a comparison video because there's a lot of scenes that reminded me of the first two Rami films. And that post credits scene at the end just shows me that Sony clearly has their own agenda for the franchise and they don't want Marvel involved once this movie, or the next one makes them a billion dollars finally. Be careful Marvel fans, this movie is indeed good, but I'm still cautious about Sony because we all know what they can do. I just hope Tom Holland can keep up and not have to go through what Garfield did. Go support the movie but just know that once Sony gets their money they'll give Marvel the boot and start the Sinister 6 plan all over again. Guaranteed. And unfortunately I can't say I liked it more than Spider-Man 2, but it comes close really close."

","Why the 3rd reboot in 15 years? Because Spiderman is ranked 3rd in IGN's top comic book heroes list. Because Spiderman is Stan lee's greatest creation, and he is also the ultimate everyday hero. Because Spiderman is the most profitable superhero in the world- global retail licensed Spiderman products outsell revenue from Justice League and Avengers COMBINED. Because Spiderman movies have made over $4 billion at the box office.<br/><br/>No wonder Marvel wanted him so bad into their fold. Bringing him back to the Marvel Cinematic Universe works out well though, as in his first solo outing, Marvel effortlessly integrates the friendly, neighborhood character into the bigger scheme of things. And all it took, was to set it up in school. <br/><br/>The plot is built around the challenges Peter has in adjusting to school life after the epic airport brawl in Captain America: Civil War. Peter thinks he is ready for more missions, but Tony Stark does not. And if we thought at the end of Civil War that Stark would take on an active mentoring role for Peter, we were wrong. He has outsourced that to Happy Hogan. Peter alternates between fighting localized crime, and going weak in the knees whenever Liz Toomes passes by. When a robbery crew led by the technology scavenging Vulture begins to up the stakes in the neighborhood, Peter gets hot on their trails. And much like in the previous movies, Spidey villains are closer than far.<br/><br/>More The Breakfast Club than a superhero movie, Homecoming weaves comedy, teen angst, MCU and Star Wars references, lots of Spiderman supporting characters, and Avengers' cameos into an entertaining, if not entirely flawless narrative. And much like the Staten Island ferry in the film, Tom Holland holds it all together with his frenetic, nervous energy. Like the comic-book Spiderman, Holland's version is a kid trying to be a man, unlike Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield before him, who were more like men trying to be kids. Juxtaposed to an everyday hero is a great everyday villain- Michael Keaton's Vulture makes a great debut too- one can sympathize with his grievances, and his moral code. The action sequences do not really stand out, but then this movie is not really about action.<br/><br/>Is this the best Spidey movie ever? In my opinion, no- Sam Raimi's Spiderman 2 still is the one to beat. But Spiderman: Homecoming comes close, and that itself is an achievement. 8/10"
"dimskodras","7","3","7","8 July 2017"," Good but not great.
","I was 15 years old when Raimi's Spiderman hit the big screen and I was amazed by how real he made him look. It could be the young age but it was so well presented that it made you feel like Spiderman could actually be a real person out there. Raimi made almost everything feel believable and when you a fantasy movie makes you feel like that you know there's been some effort put into its making.<br/><br/>The same happened with Spiderman : Homecoming. It felt fresh,believable and had almost everything you wanted to see in a Spiderman movie. Michael Keaton's acting is definitely one of the highlights of the film while the plot is interesting enough without seeming too complicated to the point where it has to develop 5 different stories and falls flat because it simply can't support that concept. I'm a big fan of the new Spiderman and yes , it needed a reboot because the previous 2 movies felt like two long trailers. I can't wait for the sequel. Three things that I didn't like were the fact that there was no mention of the spider-sense, there was way too much humour and that we didn't get to see the Shocker in his original outfit. <br/><br/>Apart from that I feel like this movie has achieved its purpose and it created interest upon the upcoming Spiderman sequel but also the next Avengers movie. Go Spidey!"
"Kingslaay","Null","3","7","8 July 2017"," A great and fun filled Spider man film
","Marvel has done it again and produced a really great Superhero film with a fresh and younger spin. The film was funny, entertaining and well made. One of the things that stood out for me was how well this film worked with a very young teenage protagonist and other young cast members. Usually films with kids as the stars are meant for a younger audience where kids unrealistically try to pull off stupid and unbelievable stunts. However this film didn't shy away from the fact that Peter Parker was just a kid and the beauty of this was it allowed him to mature and grow into Spiderman. Unlike most Superhero films we have seen for the last few decades this shows a very young aspiring superhero grow into one and learn the ropes. It also gives the audience a chance to connect and like this Peter Parker. <br/><br/>The plot was good and Tom Holland made an excellent Peter Parker. The humor and funny situations worked really well and showing Spider man trying to pull off something when he didn't know how was entertaining to watch. A great twist was introduced towards the end of the film which was quite well done. Iron Man's involvement also worked well with Tony Stark taking on a mentoring role and exercising tough love. The only criticism was the final fight scene involving the plane as it was hard to make sense of what was actually going on. Overall a great film and a big improvement on the disastrous recent two Spiderman films with Andrew Garfield. Toby Mcguire's time as Spiderman in the early 2000s gave us some very good films that set a high bar. It is nice to know that standard has now been met with a great new and fresh Spiderman. <br/><br/>8/10"

","Honestly the jokes made the cinema where I went laughing, with myself probably laughing to tears at some part, so this Spidey version does tick with some people's sense of humour.<br/><br/>Admittedly, its high school life feels a lot like Disney Production, so that lacks originality. But playing safe here doesn't really diminish its entertaining value. In fact it may make it easier for new audience of MCU. <br/><br/>Iron man involvement here was quite complimentary, but could be definitely improved with less awkward jokes and unnecessary pretense every time he appears. Still, his enterprise appearance has successfully mocked adults' treatment of teenagers (as stereotypically usual), which would easily strike a chord with most adolescent audience. <br/><br/>Storyline is still shallow regardless, but has a relatively good improvement on the account of villains (compared to most other MCUs like Avengers, GoTG).

The movie makes Spider-Man into a slightly nerdy teenager and a really incompetent hero.<br/><br/>The really incompetent hero spin is what totally ruined the movie - right up there with Ant-Man.

I loved the buddy plot. It was good to see Michael Keaton playing a villain. There are some stellar additions to the supporting cast and I appreciated the cameos from a few of the characters from the Marvel universe, and of course, Stan Lee, himself.

"TheMovieDoctorful","2","2","4","16 December 2018"," A Soulless, Hollow, Stakeless Toy Commercial, The Worst Spider-Man Film Ever
","With the recent release of Into the Spider-Verse, I couldn't think of a better time to vent my feelings about this terrible, terrible superhero film. Spider-Man: Homecoming is horrendous. It's a disgrace, It's an insult to everything that made me fall in love with the character of Spider-Man. Calling it a ""movie"" would be generous; it's a soulless product designed to sell Spider-Man toys and hype up future films. It is Marvel's Batman & Robin; a pandering toy commercial without the slightest semblance of a heart or genuine creative vision.<br/><br/>Tom Holland's performance is actually solid. I REALLY hated his acting in Civil War, but it was convincing here. I still think Nat Wolff would have been a better pick for a young Peter Parker, but Holland definitely does the best he can. Michael Keaton's Vulture is one of the MCU's best villains.He's sympathetic, he's charming, he's scary, I understood and felt for his motives. And he gets EASILY the best dialogue in the whole film. Zendaya is genuinely really funny in this film. I noticed she acted a lot more like Ultimate Gwen Stacy than Mary Jane, but you won't hear me complaining about that. It's also worth noting that Spider-Man's costume is the best he's ever had in a live action movie. It's a really cool combination of Spectacular and Alex Ross Spider-Man. As a massive fan of both, I really appreciated it. Hell, even the homemade costume he makes later on in the movie was pretty cool. It still resembles the Friendly Neighborhood Webslinger we all know and love, but has the charm of a homemade costume. It reminded me of a teenager's first cosplay and I mean that in the best possible way. Also, I thought the found footage scene at the beginning was actually really cool and fit in perfectly with the Spider-Man character. I wouldn't even be opposed to a whole movie done in this style.<br/><br/>This film has absolutely no emotional stakes. And no, when I say ""no emotional stakes"", that doesn't mean I need the destruction of New York to be at stake. Ant-Man, Daredevil: Director's Cut, Unbreakable, Logan, Ang Lee's Hulk, none of these films had apocalyptic stakes attached to them. What they did, however, was a hero with something to lose. Something to fight for that's worth investing for as an audience member. Even Spawn, as much talk as there is of Armageddon and international, has very grounded and human emotional stakes in Spawn having to save, and ultimately let go, of his wife. Why should I give a damn if Spider-Man can't stop The Vulture? Because a couple of criminals will get their hands on alien weapons they probably won't even know how to use? Great, Iron Man could clean that up in an afternoon.<br/><br/>I'm not sure who this annoying, pretentious jackass that dresses up in a red and blue costume is, but he sure as Hell isn't Spider-Man or Peter Parker. As Spider-Man, he consistently ignores any attempt to try and talk down The Vulture and appeal to his humanity, even when he knows he's just doing what he's doing to provide for his kid. As Peter, he constantly breaks promises with no consequence until the very end. Even then it's underwhelming; a crush that he barely talked too doesn't like him anymore. Compare that to previous Spider-Man films where his irresponsibility has led to the crumbling of relationships with his loved ones, if not their deaths.<br/><br/>I have no idea what the Hell they were thinking when they casted Tony Revolori as Flash Thompson. It was a terrible, dumbfounding idea from the start that was executed just as bad as I thought it would be. This kid is in no way intimidating and his attempts to be so are downright cringe inducing. And don't you dare give me the excuse that ""they made him a more realistic bully"" because that's idiotic and you know it. No, they just switched from a dumb jock stereotype to an obnoxious prep stereotype.<br/><br/>Marisa Tomei gives one of the worst performances I've ever seen in a comic book film. Her anti-chemistry with Tom Holland makes every scene they share together agonizingly torturous. Tomei's embarrassing ""hot parent"" act is beyond forced and disingenuous and her painful overacting doesn't even manage to reach ""so bad, it's good"" heights. And even if she can act, it's not like the script gives her much to do. This is a screenplay that has Aunt May 60s dancing with her son (Hey writers, could you try being consistent on what decade you're trying to emulate?) and saying lines like ""You know I larb you."" Okay, FULL ON stop. A human being ACTUALLY sat down, typed up this script and thought to themselves that this is how human beings naturally talk.<br/><br/>Homecoming is also aesthetically bland and visually hideous with cinematography straight out of a fan film and some of the worst CGI in a Hollywood blockbuster in 19 years. How the Hell is this getting a pass when we have NO such problem calling out Justice League for ITS terrible CGI. I swear to you that there are often times where it literally looks like an Ultimate Alliance cutscene.<br/><br/>People call The Amazing Spider-Man 2 overstuffed and corporate yet have the audacity to defend this? A movie that shoves in The Prowler, Scorpion, Betty Brant, 2 Shockers, Mary Jane and Sinister Six teasing while giving them no thematic or narrative purpose whatsoever. A movie that literally pauses itself to shove in a reference to Ferris Bueller. A movie that replaces Uncle Ben with Iron Man for the sole purpose of selling action figures. But ""Marvel respects Spider-Man more than Sony"" right?<br/><br/>Homecoming isn't just a ""bad Spider-Man movie"", it's just a bad movie in general. The writing is sickeningly poor, many of the acting performances are mediocre at best and the emotional stakes are COMPLETELY non-existent. It ruins everything that makes Spider-Man great."

","I almost stopped watching this after the first 10 minutes. I thought where the hell did they dig this actor up? Immature, silly and just plain annoying, I did decide to keep going and see what would transpire.<br/><br/>I'm a fan of the original Spider Man movies with Toby MaGuire. I never saw the ones that followed afterward so I can't talk about the other actor who portrayed the legendary Super-Hero.<br/><br/>Other users talk about how Spider-Man played by Tom Cameron is the youngest actor to play the role. Physically not so much. He doesn't strike me as any younger looking than Toby MaGuire looked in the very first Spider-Man movie.. After all Peter Parker is still a high school kid, but it's his lack of maturity and his personality that makes him appear younger than any other Peter Parker/Spider-Man we've seen. Perhaps they should have titled this Spider-Boy cause he's a far cry from a man.<br/><br/>As for the acting. The acting was very good. Robert Downey Jr. was great as he always is and as for Michael Keaton. For me Michael Keaton who plays Adrian Toomas/Vulture and who was the original from the early Batman movies and who remains my favorite. I never cared for the other actors in that role. He was great in this movie as well..<br/><br/>Up to the first 15 minutes of this film though, I kept waiting for something fun, or exciting to happen. Finally at 16 minutes in I got my wish. Tom Cameron once in the role of Spider-Man was a bit more bearable.<br/><br/>When he rescues an owner of a grocery store after fighting some crooks dressed as ""the Avengers"" who attempted to rob the place, he brings the store owner outside and also has the owner's cat in his arms. He got points from me, for rescuing the furry feline.<br/><br/>This movie picks up, I've read after the last Avengers movie where Spider-Man comes to Tony Stark's aid (didn't see that movie). So in this movie he is pretty much obsessed with doing another job for Tony Stark and The Avengers. But in the meantime he does his thing of fighting the bad guys, restoring the peace etc. Everyone around him though including his guard/chaperone, a guy named ""Happy"" played by Jon Favreau, treats him like a rather annoying kid, and even many of his high school peers who don't realize he's really Spider-Man and make fun of him. But his closest friend Ned played by Jacob Batalon, one night finds out who he really is. <br/><br/>The biggest surprise in this movie was how they portrayed Aunt May. Instead of a rather grand motherly looking older type they portrayed her as a much younger woman with sex appeal. This did not make sense at all to me. Even give the fact that Peter Parker is only 15 in this movie and in the original, he was a high school senior at 17. Still in 2 years his Aunt wouldn't have aged that much. So they basically changed it totally for this movie.<br/><br/>The SFX were great in the movie as to be expected. The scene involving the rescue at the Washington Monument was exciting and awesome. And the little miniature spider ""Droney"", a flying interrogation robot was cute and cool.<br/><br/>And Spidey's biggest help is from the computerized voice that's part of the program in his suit. He names her ""Carrie,"" but sometimes she is too literal. asking him frequently, whenever a bad guy is identified, if he wants her to engage ""Instant kill switch."" :)<br/><br/>There was more humorous moments too. When the guy who's been selling the high tech weapons gives Spidey a couple tips after he seals the guys trunk, as Spider-Man is racing away the guy asks if he's going to fix his trunk, that he has ice cream in there. Spider-Man says, ""You deserved that! You deserved that, you're a criminal!""<br/><br/>What's funny too is that Spider-Man is referred to by some of the bad guys as ""Spider-guy.""<br/><br/>Another thing is, as in other Spider-Man movies the police still view Spider-Man as a threat and often get in his way even with all the help he's given them. It's the people who view Spider-Man and the other super forces as heroes.<br/><br/>The ending is spectacular, and more surprises in store, which some of them complicate matters but at that point I was glad that I continued watching. I highly recommend this movie if you can get past the first 10 minutes as I did, you just might find it fun and entertaining."

After the events of Captain America: Civil War, Spider-Man is thrilled and wants to impress Iron Man. Unfortunately, in trying to do so, he gets into more trouble than he bargained for. You can't just call this a superhero movie, because it's visibly more than that. It's a coming-of-age teen movie, that happens to be about Peter Parker. We see our hero go through all the normal aspects of high school life: sitting alone in a cafeteria, asking his crush out on a date, the regular stuff. But, of course, it's a Spider-Man movie, so there's a lot of action, including a truly vertigo-inducing sequence involving the top of the Washington Monument. All in all, it's a step in a different direction for the Spider-Man character, but it's a welcome one."

","Peter Parker tries to balance his life as an ordinary high school student in Queens but is put under threat when he tries to stop a criminal on his own.<br/><br/>Under Jon Watts' direction Tom Holland capture's the Peter Parker/Spiderman character nicely, the handfuls of writers inject Homecoming with the humour of source material. Here Parker is not a reporter yet, he's still really a Spider-boy. Thankfully it's not another direct origin story but Spidey is coming used to his new powers. <br/><br/>In this Marvel film universe Parker has an intelligent computer Iron Man-like suit, Karen, voice by Jennifer Connelly. The computer and Parker's relationship makes for some genuine laughs. But it's never clearly defined what Spidey's powers actually are without Karen the A.I. suit, aside from strength and practical web-shooters. It's great that his mask has visors, providing more expressiveness to his appearance like in the comics/cartoons, but we need more Spidey sense.<br/><br/>Watts has a lot of practical and causal suited up Spiderman but there's still too much obvious CGI as appose to just wire replacement. The on location feel helps sell the environment and you buy into Parker's world. Holland has the 70's live action TV show likability of Nicholas Hammond and captures the spirit of Spiderman in the dialogue and action set ups but also the teen angst. <br/><br/>Without drawing too many comparisons, yes, it's another actor, another Spiderman, under Sony while Tobey Maguire was a good actor, arguably Sam Raimi's offerings struggled to capture the comic or cartoon feel. Although Andrew Garfield was perfectly cast and Marc Webb's films were closer to the Parker we love, it wasn't fresh enough coming in the shadow of the previous three. All suffered from a reliance on a CGI Spiderman and overlong paint by numbers story. What Watts and writers do get right is the bad guy, Michael Keaton does a great job as grounded villain Vulture that offers a curve ball revelation in the last quarter. His character isn't black and white, with bags of motivation and purpose. <br/><br/>As a nod to fans they also subtly introduce MJ and Flash is updated fittingly. There's some Avengers jokes and the comedy in general hits the mark. Especially with Holland's Michael .J .Fox toned quips and Parker's Teenwolf-like high school insecurities and Superman identity crisis work. His sidekick friend Jacob Batalon's Ned who offers some good comic relief. Uncle Ben is omitted. Stan Lee has an obligatory cameo.<br/><br/>Jon Favreau's Hogan and Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark/Iron Man do turn up a little too much and feel forced fan service in there extended cameos. Gwyneth Paltrow Pepper Potts briefly appears along with Tyne Daly. Bokeem Woodbine has notable screen presence as Tom Holland's Shockers replacement. Also stick around for Keaton's telling mid-end credits segment. <br/><br/>Overall, as a superhero film it's good, as a Spiderman film it's probably the best to date but not without it's faults."

From minute one it was obvious that a lot had gone on in those other Spider Mans because it was barely the same Peter Parker/Spider-Man I met all those years ago. For one thing a lot is made of an outfit called The Avengers, which seems to be a group of superheroes bent on saving the planet and of which Spider-Man is a member. Then he has a 'mentor' in the shape of Robert Downey jnr, a 'special' friend best described as a nerd and has a crush on a Black schoolmate, so much for the Kirsten Dunst character. It seems evident that the last two or three Spider-Man movies are not so much stand-alones as sequential so I can only comment on this entry as something I only partly 'got'.

Michael Keaton plays the heavy with great sneer, and Marisa Tomei is exactly what you'd expect as a younger Aunt May (plus, she offers one of the greatest closing lines I've ever heard). These are great spins on classic characters.

","Marvel has had a dream run with exciting, engaging films until meddling with the latest reboot of Spider-Man. Instead of expanding the universe, this ho-hum exercise in Marvel franchising wastes the considerable talents of Tom Holland while working an increasingly tired Iron-Man tone into proceedings. The film is salvaged by the performers from Michael Keaton to Zendaya, who are able to bring an engagement the Marvel heavy footprints crush with their self-serving empire building. <br/><br/>The story is deliberately Lo-Fi, aiming for a point of difference within the recent film history by scaling back the action and emotions. This works surprisingly well in the high school and home settings but undermines the intensity of set-piece sequences which, instead of building the excitement, come off as distinctly average CGI scenes. DC took the lead for me in Super-Hero movie magic with Wonder Woman, combining action, drama and emotion with intensity. The problem with Spider-Man Homecoming is the lack of potency for the plot development, the investment doesn't have great pay-offs.<br/><br/>On the plus side, letting the film be better than it deserves to be, Tom Holland does make Spider-Man his own character despite the teen-movie conventions and Marvel tyranny. The refreshing take on Peter Parker's high school friends works in the film's favour with good performances from the young cast, especially Zendaya. Michael Keaton does well to add dimensions to a fairly standard villain. Maris Tomei, however, isn't quite right as Aunt Mae which is a script and plotting issue rather than a performance one. <br/><br/>The production has made much of the local setting being true to the comics, but the lack of narrative drive takes away from the many promising elements. It's not a bad film, just an average one. It lacks genuine threat, suspense, tension and engaging excitement. Thankfully, the cast push this one beyond the Marvel Franchise limitations, offering hope for future films."

","Following the massive underperformance of the Amazing Spiderman 2 in 2014, Sony Pictures was in a difficult position as while the Spiderman films were still making good money at the box-office, something needed to be done to shake things up on the filmmaking side of things as the company had no intent to sell the Spiderman rights to Marvel due to their own financial problems but with fan support for Peter Parker to join the MCU growing louder, it became obvious that Sony would need help with the future of Spiderman on film. As it turned out, Marvel Studios was already willing to lead Sony a helping hand long before any of their shared universe plans could be put into motion. Due to their grip on the Spiderman merchandise, Disney was far more willing to promote the Spiderman films that Sony was making then they were with the X-Men and Fantastic 4 films 20th Century Fox were making at the time. Nevertheless, Marvel still had an interest in binging the webhead into their cinematic universe in order to provide a strong foundation for the MCU after the end of Phase 3. Despite being reluctant to work with Marvel, Sony head honchos Tom Rothman and Amy Pascal decided that a deal where Spiderman would appear in an MCU film in return for an MCU character making a camo in one of their Spiderman spin-off films would be perfect as this would allow Marvel Studios to produce a trio of Spiderman films for Sony all while allowing them to maintain creative control, marketing, and distribution as well as breathing new life back into the brand. However, a massive rift of corporate safety was about to force Sony to make a deal between them and Marvel.<br/><br/>In December 2014, the Seth Rogan and James Franco buddy comedy The Interview was released and given that the film's plot dealt with the assassination of North Korean leader, Kim Jong-Un, it was deemed insulting by the North Korean government which led to a group of hackers called The Guardians of Peace taking action against Sony by stealing a large number of files from the company and even went so far as to threaten terrorist action if the film was released. While a wealth of information on Sony and its upcoming slate of films were leaked to the public, the most important impact of this was that the future of Spiderman on film was about to change. Once the information of Sony's discussions with Marvel about Spidy joining the greater MCU went pubic, fan support for Peter Parker appearing in the Marvel Cinematic Universe grew louder as more pressure was put on Sony to make a deal with Marvel Studios. In January of 2015, the higher-ups at Sony were interested in holding a meeting with the heads of Marvel Studios in order to have a clearer idea of where they wanted to go with their Spiderman films. Sony chairperson Amy Pascal suggested that Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige be invited to the meeting but once the Sony hack occurred, Kevin's presence at the meeting became a necessity in order to give the meeting a little more direction and to put more of a focus on bringing Spiderman into the MCU. In February of 2015, both Marvel and Sony announced that they would be sharing custody of Spiderman and while Sony Pictures would still retain the Spiderman film rights but they would be allowed to the MCU characters into the films they co-produced with Marvel Studios and maintain a certain degree of creative control while Marvel would be allowed to use Spiderman and his supporting cast in the MCU for 5 films starting with the character being rebooted within the confines of the cinematic universe but Sony would also be allowed to make solo films that wouldn't necessarily tie into the MCU thus allowing them to make their own stand-alone shared universe.<br/><br/>Now, as someone who isn't a massive Spiderman fan, I was quite excited when I heard the news that a new Spiderman film would be apart of the MCU and upon seeing the trailer for Spiderman: Homecoming, I was pumped to see it so In July of 2017, I went to see it with a friend of mine and after watching the film, I can say that despite a few small issues, Spiderman Homecoming is a fantastic return to form for the character of Spiderman and while it does lack the strong cinematic punches the first two Sam Raimi films have, I still genuinely love this movie.<br/><br/>The film begins following the aftermath of The Avengers where salvage worker Adrian Toombs and his team are cleaning up the left-overs from the Battle of New York but when the Department of Damage Control arrives and force Toombs and his gang out of business, Adrian decided to sell the Chitauri tech they've salvaged and use it in selling advanced weapons. We when fast forward 8 years later to Peter Parker after the events of Captain America: Civil War. After aiding Tony Stark in Germany, Peter continues his high-school education while also focusing on fighting crime in his neighborhood as Spiderman. However, while foiling a bank heist one night, Peter has a run-in with criminals using weapons Toombs sold them, and another night, Parker has a run-in with Adrian's gang as they sell weapons to local criminal Aaron Davis. n the ensuing fight, Peter is almost killed but is saved by Tony who warns him not to interfere with the gang. Now, Peter must prove his worth as an Avenger while also juggling his high-school and family life as Toombs threats everything Peter loves.<br/><br/>In essence, Spiderman: Homecoming is basically two films that are efficiently set up by the title alone. In the plainest sense, it's basically a teen coming-of-age story that just happens to be set against the background of a Marvel superhero film. More than some other entries in the recent superhero film boom, Homecoming is very clearly a young adult film but not in the vein of Twilight or the Mortal Instruments. It's Spiderman if directed by John Hughes with all the clich√É¬©s and customs of the genre as seen through the arch of a teen film. As such, the homecoming aspect refers to not only Peter Parker's place as a high school student but also signifies the character's return to the greater Marvel film universe. In a more symbolic sense, Spiderman: Homecoming is the story of bringing Peter Parker into the larger MCU that began with Iron Man back in 2008 but it also honors the deal forged between Sony and Marvel. Both sides of the film work to each other's advantage as the first half serve as a John Hughes Spiderman film while the other half serves as a nice tie-in to the Avengers and Captian America: Civil War. To add to that, The first Avengers film is very much a fixation for Spiderman: Homecoming as it's showing us that the first scene of the film doesn't focus on Peter Parker or Spiderman but rather the aftermath of the Battle of New York. The second shot the viewer sees is of Avengers Tower in it's ruined state along with a drawing that symbolizes Peter's longing to join the Avengers as well as reflecting Peter's dream of joining the likes of Iron Man and Thor and it is this fantasy that will challenge Peter later on in the film.<br/><br/>Now, in all honesty, Spiderman's journey to the MCU is a long and difficult one. In the mid-1990s when Marvel Comics had filed for bankruptcy, they had no choice but to sell off the film rights to many of their most beloved characters to film studios. Sony got Spiderman and Ghost Rider while The X-men, Fantastic 4, and Daredevil were all stanched up by 20th Century Fox. In a lot of ways, the Marvel Cinematic Universe was built on the backs of a bunch of B and C list superheroes, characters that no film studio wanted, and that not a lot of people were familiar with. Basically, the success of Blade in 1998, Bryan Singer's X-men in 2000 and Sam Raimi's Spiderman in 2002 predate the MCU by a decade and showed that comic book films could be so much more than just campy action but once Iron Man was released in 2008, Marvel Studios soon become a force to reckoned with in the Hollywood landscape and after being bought by Disney in 2009, they went from being an underdog to being one of the biggest studios in Hollywood. This high-octane shift changed the superhero game so much that Marvel started grabbing the film and TV rights to unwanted characters like the Punisher and Daredevil and after the purchase of Fox's entertainment division in 2017, the X-Men and Fantastic Four. By the time Sony rebooted Spiderman in 2012, the Marvel Cinematic Universe was such a powerhouse in the world of cinema that where was even talk of having the Oscorp Tower show up in the first Avengers film but, it didn't pan out and Spiderman remained disconnected from the greater MCU for the time being.<br/><br/>So following the underperformance of the second Amazing Spiderman film and the firing of Andrew Garfield, Sony was left with ether recasting the role of Peter Parker, rebooting the series again or working with Marvel Studios, and while many Sony executives wanted to keep Spiderman out of the MCU, coming for a shared custody agreement with Kevin Feige and the rest of the Marvel creative team was the best possible course of action both companies could have made as even if Sony had continued on with the own Spiderman shared universe, I feel that Sony would have over-saturated the market with Spiderman films and spin-offs which would have led to moviegoer fatigue and continuing diminishing returns on investments so I personally feel the deal between Marvel and Sony works both ways even if the temporary split between the two companies last year resulted in Spiderman almost being yanked out of the MCU but thankfully cooler heads prevailed and for the time being, Spiderman is back home at Marvel.<br/><br/>Now, unlike what some Spiderman fans might claim, there's absolutely nothing wrong with having Spiderman join the larger MCU as it allows the filmmakers to create their own story that still fits within the confines of the world that has already been built for the Avengers and their associates. After all, ever since Spiderman's debut i"

","Out of the numerous casting calls that Marvel has done since they launched their cinematic universe, two stand out to me : Robert Downey Jr. (obviously) as Tony Stark and Tom Holland as Peter Parker. In my opinion, there is no debate as to who is the best live-action incarnation of the character.<br/><br/>This film is just so much fun, I never get bored of watching it. A lot of that is due to the fact that Tom Holland owns his part, succeeding at playing a believable high schooler much better than Maguire or Garfield. Micheal Keaton is equally awesome as the Vulture, and his scenes with Holland are my favorites of the entire movie, especially when they don't have their suits on. Their dynamic is a big part of why I love this film so much.<br/><br/>I heard people complain about how Tony Stark's presence in the movie casts a shadow over Spider-Man. I personally don't mind the handling of their relationship at all : in fact, I believe that he is seen just enough for the purpose of driving their relationship forward, but not too much to steal the spotlight. Really, there are few things to complain about when it comes to Spider-Man : Homecoming."

","Let me start by saying Spider-Man Homecoming is an absolute blast. It's everything you could want from a Spider-Man movie. Tom Holland did a fantastic job as Spider-Man. He was an interesting, lovable Peter Parker and an absolutely classic Spider-Man. Michael Keaton was an exceptional vulture. You couldn't ask for a better actor to play him. This also had a lot of very comedic moments so if you enjoy comedies, this would be a good movie to see. This is how Spider-Man should always be. Lovable, funny, kind of awkward and witty and that's exactly what we get from this movie that we didn't fully get in The Amazing Spider-Man movies. I noticed some people were comparing to Spider-Man 2 and saying which one was better. I think they are both awesome but they are also very different in certain ways. Overall, this is a fun flick for the whole family to watch. Not much more you could have asked for."

","This Spider-Man movie is the first Spider-Man movie in the Marvel canon. The prior two Spider-Man franchises are irrelevant to this series. Spider-Man, introduced in Captain America: Civil War, is part of the final phase of the Marvel Universe leading up to Avengers: The Infinity War/End Game. Marvel opted to skip the origin story of Spider-Man and instead, framed this film to be more of a coming of age tale for Peter Parker (Tom Holland) and his quest to become part of the Avengers.<br/><br/>Technically the film is very impressive from start to finish and there are some truly great scenes scattered throughout the picture. The action scenes are all highly exciting and it's the perfect use of CGI.<br/><br/>The performance by Holland was excellent and I thought he was perfect during the scenes where the character is actually being a nerd and conflicted with various emotions. Keaton was also great in his role as he perfectly played the villain. Robert Downey, Jr. could sleepwalk in his role as Tony Stark and was fun as usual.<br/><br/>It's nice light comic book fare. Others in the cast involve: Marisa Tomei as Peter Parker's Aunt May; Gwyneth Paltrow appears as Pepper Potts, Tony Stark's assistant/girlfriend; Chris Evans reprises his role as Captain America appearing in educational PSA videos that Peter ends up watching during school; John Favreau reprises his role as Happy Hogan, head of security for the Avengers; and Disney star Zendaya plays one of Peter's classmates. 8/10"

","Another new 'Spiderman' movie, and it still doesn't disappoint which isn't a surprise. What I found interesting about this particular one was just how different it was compared to the previous ones. It has a new set of villains/enemies (Vulture and Shocker), and of course, a new Spiderman (Tom Holland).<br/><br/>The main characters, Spiderman and Vulture, played by the actors were excellent choices, and I don't think anyone else could've done it any better. Michael Keaton and Tom Holland are excellent choices.<br/><br/>What I enjoyed the most about this movie was the villain - Vulture! A 'new villain' compared to the other villains of previous movies, so I wasn't surprised that we've seen a new one yet again. That was a good thing. Can you imagine seeing the Green Goblin again? Despite being Spiderman's greatest foe. Only way it can work today if there are other villains along side with it, and I can only see that with the 'Sinister Six' or something, and that's something that may happen within this franchise later. I hope it does. I'm actually one of the few that won't mind seeing the Green Goblin again. He's Spiderman's greatest enemy!<br/><br/>Vulture, though, is one of the most 'popular' as well as the 'coolest' Spiderman villains out there, and I'm finally glad he appeared in this movie. Also, he's one of the most underrated Spiderman villain. He has such an interesting back-story, and this movie depicts it very well. The Vulture was the reason this movie was a success. Those wings were mighty impressive and mighty cool! I liked them. That's one of the new enemies of Spiderman.<br/><br/>Let's not forget another villain portrayed in this movie known as the Shocker!!! The only downside with the Shocker was that we didn't get to see enough of him in this movie, and he wasn't noticeable because he didn't have a costume of some sort, and that was a mistake I feel. In the anime, Shocker is shown wearing a 'yellow costume' that includes wearing a mask, and I wanted to see something like that shown in this movie just like in the anime. Shocker may not be the most popular of Spiderman foes, but he's certainly one of the more 'coolest' looking ones, but we didn't see it in this movie. This movie could've been a whole lot better than what it already was if the Shocker was given more attention. We may see Shocker again later in the series, and maybe he will have his own attire to wear. I hope he does. It will make the movie better.<br/><br/>The title for this movie, Homecoming, is a good title. I liked how this series is trying to be different and attract attention. I think it's a good thing, and I think it will work heading into the future. I predict a great Spiderman series. This could be the start of something fresh. I like this reboot. Let's hope it works!"

","Spider-Man: Homecoming is a honed, clear, flowing popcorn flick with a charming and watchable lead from Tom Holland (a perfectly agreeable young Nathan Drake).<br/><br/>First and foremost despite looking great, Homecoming is just one big Easter egg inside of an Easter egg. It's an edible Russian nesting doll of injokes and nudges and winks and throwaway moments; take Giacchino's cheeky nod the animated theme at the start, and some of them work but most of them don't. The timeline for a start feels a little muddled (which film was Avengers Tower rebuilt in? What bad guys did what where and left what behind?), but I did roll my eyes with a certain satisfaction at points which pretty sums up my feelings on the film.<br/><br/>I mean, they did all they could; they made it a Peter Parker movie where Parker was more interesting than Spider-Man (ASM's Andrew Garfield is spectacular but he had much less to work with than his Spider-Man). The action sequences were not exactly bad and they were coherent but just a bit uninspired. But to be fair ASM2 was far too inspired! And I'd like to take a moment to complain about the miscast, from another film, saccharine, live-studio-audience-sitcom-type actress Laura Harrier playing Liz that was cringey to the extreme.<br/><br/>But by god did I not see some of the third act coming. I mean I should have, I just didn't, so I applaud it for that. It led to some nice direct parallels between teen angst and superhero trials It was nice to see Spider-Man finding Peter Parker and then fusing the two: Not finding your identity in your assets, gifts, support but instead in yourself is a clear and relatable theme; Peter is not a suit or an Avenger or an intern for a billionaire, he's a young boy that makes mistakes and bounces back and does the right thing.<br/><br/>I liked the marketing/posters, I liked the poppy but indistinct score, the smart costume made it different enough. The blogger opening was fresh and down to earth and more Happy Hogan is always welcome. And the Iron Man-esque stinger at the end and the post-credits sequence are both laugh out loud. Plus there's a key tone in this film where Peter and his friends are aware of superheroes, and in a way, superhero films, and this kind of fourth wall thing (man in the chair??!!) made for a nicely unique tone compared to the other Spider-Mans.<br/><br/>So Homecoming has some hilarious, on-point, gags, some excellent acting and great, out-there, actor choices; having two lead females (three if you include Aunt May) of overt ethnic minorities is a huge deal these days, it shouldn't be, it should be everywhere, but it isn't and here should be applauded that his school feels like a real one.<br/><br/>But at the end of the day, most of all, Homecoming is Avengers 2.5, or maybe, for better or worse, Iron Man 3.5."

","This film marks the third film in the Spiderman franchise, under the seal of Marvel. In this film, young Peter Parker tries to harmonize his normal teenage life with the action and risks of a masked hero. Contrary to the other films, where he makes memorable actions thanks to luck and a handful of skill, in this film they are the problems that come to Peter.<br/><br/>Tom Holland is a convincing Peter Parker, quite confused about what to do and eager to prove himself before Tony Stark. The actor did a good job and managed to give us a Parker that oscillates between instinctive heroism and insecurity, typical of a boy in his teens. Robert Downey Jr. brings us, as usual in the Marvel film franchise, the iconic Iron Man, which he had already made in other films and which he managed to make self-centered and a demanding mentor. Michael Keaton brought a complex and psychologically rich villain to life, far more than most I've seen in films of this genre, which was extremely positive. I also enjoyed watching the work of, Marisa Tomei and Jon Favreau.<br/><br/>Innovative and ingenious, the film does not explain the character's origins and goes directly to what matters, functioning almost as a sequel to previous films made with this character. At first it was difficult for me to swallow this mixture of comedy and cartoons, and some of the jokes in the film had no effect on me. There is also, clearly, an attempt to moderate the action and fighting scenes that guided previous films and to offer less but good, with good CGI and very realistic visual effects. Excellent photography with vivid colors and good play of light and shadow help to make this film pleasing to the eyes and ears."

And it's not just the basic conflict that smaller in scale, the thematic and character driven ground of the film is smaller as well, but that's a good thing.<br/><br/>Peter Parker, after his brush with the Avengers in Captain America: Civil War, hangs out in Queens, looking for little things to help with, in his new suit built by Tony Stark. It's high tech, and it's giving him an inflated view of his place in the world. He wants more than just helping little ladies with directions. He wants to be an Avenger. He wants to participate in the large scale world ending events that the rest of the team helps with, but no one will return his calls.<br/><br/>His opportunity comes when he foils a bank robbery involving high tech weaponry. Through a bit of a coincidence, he figures out the next step in an investigation that leads to the Vulture, a former contractor with the city of New York who turned to crime after his contract to clean up the mess from Loki's attack fell through. With a heaping of class warfare in his veins, he's taken to stealing alien tech from whomever has it and selling it to whoever will buy it.<br/><br/>Peter follows them to D.C. where he misses an academic competition getting trapped in a warehouse before he escapes and saves his classmates from a falling elevator in the Washington Memorial. Peter, inflated by his own sense of ability, pursues the arms dealers in New York until they get on the ferry, a situation that Peter makes significantly worse. Through his involvement, a weapon ends up splitting the ferry in half, Peter can't save it, and Tony Stark must come to his aid in his Iron Man suit. Highly displeased with Peter's immaturity and inability to measure his own ability against the situation, Tony takes the high tech suit from Peter, leaving him the homemade one he had fashioned before Tony had given him an upgrade.<br/><br/>Peter, chastised and ready to accept his lowered position in the superhero chain, discovers that his nascent girlfriend is daughter to the Vulture, and the Vulture figures him out on a drive to the Homecoming dance. Unable to reach Tony, Peter does what he thinks is right and chases them, finding that he may be risking his life, but he does have it within him, without the high tech suit, to make the kind of difference he wants to make in the world.<br/><br/>What makes this movie work is Peter himself. Tom Holland has fun in the role, but it's the writing that really makes it. Peter's journey is appropriate for a teenager suddenly given a large amount of power. His ego overtakes his common sense and he goes too far. His chastisement feels genuine, and his desire to prove himself even in the face of that punishment works quite well. The balance with his personal life isn't handled as well as his core journey. It's not bad at all, but I feel like it drags the movie a bit. I don't see a good reason why this movie should be a whole 130 minutes long. It's not that big of a story.<br/><br/>Still, it's fun with a solid cast and a strong central story."

","Directed by Jon Watts. Starring Tom Holland, Michael Keaton, Jacob Batalon, Robert Downey Jr., Jon Favreau, Marisa Tomei, Laura Harrier, Donald Glover, Zendaya, Tony Revolori, Bokeem Woodbine, Michael Chernus, Logan Marshall-Green, Martin Starr, Hannibal Buress, (voice) Jennifer Connelly. (PG-13)<br/><br/>Overlong, overfamiliar, but adequately enjoyable Spider-Man adventure is both a second reboot in about half-a-decade and a full-length installation of the character into the fringes of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (this is a co-production of both Marvel Studios and Columbia Pictures); plot is both patently simple--the baddie, Vulture (Keaton), just wants to steal tech, sell weapons, and make a lot of money, nothing more--and unduly messy--Peter deals with not only superhero responsibilities and teenager anxieties but also Avengers drama. As it was with ""Ant-Man,"" the lowered stakes are a relief, letting character and humor grab focus away from the chaos of enormous digital pyrotechnics; granted, not all the characters are especially interesting and the humor misses as often as it hits, but at least it probably won't give anyone a headache. Holland makes for a plucky, ingenuous Peter Parker, cracking wise more often than Maguire and Garfield combined (a little of him goes a long way--he was more tolerable as a supporting player in the third Captain America movie); Keaton does his best as the villain, but the character's motivations and back-story are too thin to make him truly menacing and memorable. Aside from the web-slinging and jesting, Spider-Man is a different entity here: younger than usual, wearing a high-tech Spidey suit with its own AI (Connelly), crushing on someone besides Gwen Stacy or MJ, and so on. Similarly, the characteristics of nearly every supporting character (Aunt May, Vulture, Flash, Mary-Jane-but-not-really, etc.) hardly resemble those of their classic counterpart from the comics. Several stars of prior MCU films make appearances, some in supporting roles, some in cameos.<br/><br/>63/100"

","So, I had wanted Spider man in the MCU for a long time and when I saw an article that said, ""spider man makes his MCU debut in Captain America Civil War"" and it had a link for the trailer so I clicked on the link and watched the trailer, I was waiting the entire trailer and i was so excited to see spider man in the MCU but as soon a the title card showed up i gave up hope and was a bit dissapointed until i heard that line at the end of the trailer "" Alright i've run out of patience, Underoos!"" i was like ""wait what?' and then i see captain america sheild get stolen by a web and i started freaking out and i see spider man full costume and say ""Hey everyone."" I went full fanboy mode. I was so excited for a new movie with spider man and the possibility of a new spider man movie and when i heard that they were making a Spider man movie for the MCU the fanboy within me came out and started to freak out. I didnt see Spider man Homecoming in theaters though due to my local theater not keeping movies for over a month unless there was nothing new. But to get into the review, I.LOVE.THIS.MOVIE. even though i didnt get that awesome feeling of being in a theater with some butter popcorn, a large soda, and a box or bag of candy and watch a movie, i still love it. It gives us a new POV, a POV of a 15 year old kid with super powers trying to find his place as a super hero. Can i just say that Tom Holland is the best spider man yet? I mean Toby and Andrew tried but they didnt look the part or even have that funny aspect of spider man. Tom Holland captures it perfectly with plenty of the humor and charisma of spider man. And the vulture played by Micheal Keaton was a pleasure to have on screen. I cant say how long i waited for a spider man movie like this, but my god it feels good to have a spider man movie like this. i'm giving Spider man Homecoming a 10"

"Benjamin-M-Weilert","9","0","0","8 March 2019"," A layered and fun return to form for my favorite superhero.
","Of all the superheroes in their respective comic universes, the one I grew up with was Spider-Man. I watched the animated 1990's television show, and I loved when this relatable superhero made his way to the big screen in Spider-Man (2002). I was even more pleased when Spider-Man 2 (2004) set the tone for future superhero franchises. The first film is the origin film so the second film can dispense with the best villain and not spend all its time in exposition. Unfortunately, I ended up being disappointed by the third entry in this original Spider-Man trilogy, which was a rare miss in my book.<br/><br/>Fast forward to 2012, when Spider-Man was rebooted with Andrew Garfield in the title role. Having to sit through the origin story again, but with a different, green-colored villain as the antagonist seemed like it wasn't exploring anything new. Around the same time, the Marvel Cinematic Universe was exploding with tons of well-done and smartly executed superhero films. Part of me wanted Spider-Man to be in that universe, where he belonged. Fortunately, legal disputes were settled behind the scenes, and Spider-Man made his newest debut in Captain America: Civil War (2016). With Spider-Man now under Marvel's umbrella, I anticipated a smart and fresh reboot of this classic hero.<br/><br/>In Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017), New York City is front and center, which I felt was missing from the previous installments. Peter Parker (Tom Holland) is the small-time superhero that any High School kid wishes to be, but he has limitations (like in the suburbs). While the diehard fan in me loved all the little references (as well as overt nods to other media, like Michael Keaton's Oscar-winning Birdman (2014)), part of me feels these minor details might be lost on the casual observer. At any rate, I was pleased to find that this was not an origin story (again), but instead a character-driven narrative with great lessons and continuity with the Marvel Cinematic Universe. At least Keaton's version of The Vulture, despite being a ""green-themed"" villain, was more grounded in reality than the ""life force-draining"" version from the comics. I look forward to the next installment with the ""green-themed"" Scorpion as the villain, that's for sure.<br/><br/>A layered and fun return to form for my favorite superhero, I give Spider-Man: Homecoming 4.5 stars out of 5."

The movie was fun, granted it's a Marvel movie so it's pretty tough for it not to come across as that way. I was putting this movie off, because I wasn't sure I would enjoy. That was a mistake on my part and one that I'm happy to have corrected.The sequence with Keaton and Holland in the vehicle was magnificent! Loved the building of tension, but I do hate that Keaton was able to figure out that Holland was Spiderman from just a few inconsequential details.

However, I found myself having a great time watching this latest one: It's not particularly complicated, it's entertaining and well-paced, and the supporting cast (in particular Michael Keaton and the always-welcome Marisa Tomei) fit it perfectly well. However, this movie is all about Tom Holland as the young Spider-Man: He's charismatic, camera-ready, and has a knack for delivering expository dialogue with a nudge and a wink (not unlike the late Anton Yelchin). I personally was not excited for yet another Spider-Man movie (this being the sixth since 2002), but I was pleasantly surprised by how entertaining it is, and how the cast, director, writers and crew make it all seem effortless. A terrific summer diversion that's completely suitable for the whole family without being toothless or neutered."

I really appreciate that the ending was not as dismal as past Spiderman movies.
If I had to speak on the main character, he comes off as immature, but hey what 15 year old isn't? I think that they tried to provide entertainment for not only adults but young adults, teens, and kids and it works. Just keep an open mind.

"emilyfrick-68723","7","0","0","21 February 2018"," A good marvel movie, however not true to the character
","I'll start off by saying that I did enjoy the movie, the storyline was ok and there were some new original points. Absolutely not a bad movie, but here comes my issue with it:<br/><br/>It's not true to the spider-man character AT ALL. Sure, one thing I did appreciate was the fact that they made the character more like an actual teenager, and not like he's got all his life figured out already. Tom Holland by the way is perfect for the role of spider-man, he has the perfect look and quirkiness for it but my problem isn't with the actor or that he's ""immature"". My problem with this character is that he's not facing the same problems that the original spider-man faced and fought at all. The original spider-man (I'm mostly referring to the Toby Maguire ones, that I grew up with) was torn between his ""normal"" life and his superhero life, he was really passionate about school and it made him really question his life as a superhero, and then vice versa as a normal person. He couldn't really decide in to which one he should put the most effort in, and so his life was never in balance. This was his main struggle throughout all the movies. Sure, he misses some parties and his homecoming because of his life as a superhero, but he almost never has a problem with this and that's what's bugging me. <br/><br/>Then comes the fact, that played a really big part in the original franchise as well, that he is constantly fighting the criticism of the media and civilians as he is portrayed as some kind of villain by the news papers and so on. Sure, it's his first solo movie, but still it didn't feel like the world even knew about him. Students at his school mentions him once or twice, but we don't get to see any reactions fromt he general public. <br/><br/>Also, was the ferry scene supposed to re-imagine the train scene in the second movie in the original franchise? Because it sure was done really bad. That scene in the second movie (no spoilers) is really touching and adds to the story and his character in general, and it gives a better understanding of what people really thinks of him and what spider-man in general is all about. In this movie however, not so much. It adds literally NOTHING to the story besides some bad relations with Tony Stark, which in my opinions didn't do that much to the story. Sure, I understand the necessity of it because of spider-man's next action, but still I'm not satisfied. <br/><br/>Lastly, the whole idea that he needs a special suit?? I MEAN COME ON!!! Is he supposed to be a Tony Stark Jr?? Is Tony Stark making is own version of Batman?? Is he supposed to have any powers at all? Really disappointed with this part, the movie made it seem like he wasn't even spider-man any more.<br/><br/>So, my problems aren't with the movie itself - it was rather ok. My problem is with the character itself, and the lack of the original character. Sure, you can make changes, but this was way to much, in my opinions. Watch worthy, but not my spider-man."

","In the third reboot of Spiderman since Toby Maguire first starred as the webslinger in 2002 is a more-or-less bloodless adventure yarn pitting Spiderman (Tom Holland) against ""The Vulture"" (Michael Keaton). Having established the character in the previous ""Captain America: Civil War"" film (2016), this solo outing doesn't include the 'bitten by a radioactive' spider backstory and essentially starts off with the cleanup of alien artifacts following the climactic battle in ""The Avengers"" (2012). Salvage contractor Adrian Toomes (Keaton), bitter after getting cut from the project by the D.O.D.C, starts manufacturing and selling arms based on stolen alien technology and young Peter Parker, wanting to prove himself worthy of joining the Avengers, decides to stop him. The film plays up Parker's combination of superhuman abilities and teenage angst more so than the previous installments and provides him with a new comic-relief side-kick (""Ned"", Jacob Batalon). Holland is fine as the titular hero, as is Keaton as his nemesis. In keeping with trend for fantastic (and very convenient do-all-that-the-plot-requires) technology in these movies, Spiderman's suit is designed by Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and has endless built in gadgetry, including a personal assistant. The Vulture gets a complete makeover: the winged old guy with the furry neckpiece is replaced by Tommes in his high-tech flying suit (with a fur-collared flight jacket for old times' sake). Peter's elderly Aunt May has also received a makeover and is now played a much younger and sexier Marisa Tomei. When not focusing on Parker's high-school woes, the movie moves at a frenetic pace. I didn't find it as 'real' looking or as interesting as the Maguire versions and some of the action set-pieces (such as the Staten Island Ferry scenes) are absurd to a point of ridiculousness. I also found Spiderman's strength (and the strength/adhesiveness of his webbing) to vary as the plot demanded (weak internal consistency is a common problem with 'superhero' movies and (IMO) is a sure sign of sloppy/lazy writing). Not bad but just more of the same Marvel: neither memorable nor rewatchable."

","Spiderman Homecoming is the 3rd attempt of Spiderman since actors Toby Maguire and Andrew Garfield played the web slinger before Tom Holland took over and this film doesn't focus on Peter Parker being bitten by a spider and falling for MJ Watson or Gwen Stacey but a follow up to Captain America Civil War as Holland made his debut as the web slinger Spiderman who wants to join the avengers. Tony Stark(aka Iron Man played by Robert Downey Jr) helps Peter Parker with the making of his suit as we as giving him advice about joining his team dubbed The Avengers. Meanwhile there's a villain called Vulture played by Micheal Keaton from Batman fame who wants to rule mankind and its up to Spidey to save the day and discover who Vulture really is.<br/><br/>I actually bought the DVD of it for the Xmas and I was skeptic about it at first as I hated that they were rebooting this again after Andrew Garfields disaster sequel The Amazing Spiderman 2 which in fairness I enjoyed. Tom Holland reminded me of Andrew Garfield in this film and I liked how they focused more on Peter Parker and in High School and not doing the same scenario of Peter getting bitten again. Overall I enjoyed it."

","No doubt, Tobey Maguire Spider-man is the best. It was also the first modern superhero of the millennium. The visual effects and entertainment wise, the second live-action Spider-man was good too, but this one is so different. This is about a teenage superhero. Just a kid. Having possessed such superpower, how he manages it alongside his normal life was nicely told.<br/><br/>This story begins straight away, because the introduction was done in the previous Marvel film, which are part of Avengers universe. Peter Parker assisted by Tony Stark, is very keen to fight small crimes compared to what Avengers fighting for. He feels, he's held back by Iron Man, so he wanted to make independent decisions. At one stage he succeeds in that, but things get more severe. Fighting bad guys, and the other side of his life, a romance, how the remaining story turns out are revealed with a twist.<br/><br/>Tom Holland was good. The story was simple, more like one liner. But the visuals and each scene forged nicely. Having seen all the five previous Spider-man films, this was quite predictable. Particularly the characters and their connections. Seeing how it had ended, it is possible that the daughter of the villain could take-over her father's place. That would be very interesting, because of the linkage between the film characters.<br/><br/>After seeing the first look, I was afraid that this young Spider-man might be overshadowed by Iron Man, but those parts really well done. Comparing it with the 15 years ago Spider-man, the technology has been the biggest change. That's why I still love Tobey Maguire film. Very simple and down to the earth without cell phones, computers. But the current superhero films are all alien oriented/connected theme, and of course digital technology a big leap. Hoping the next film too would impress us with the same intensity. So lets wait for summer 2019.<br/><br/>7/10"

","Spider-man Homecoming: the first Spider-man movie to be involved in the larger MCU in collaboration with Sony, it stars Tom Holland as Spider-man and Michael Keaton as the Vulture. <br/><br/>This is the best Spider-man movie in years, probably the second best after Spider-man 2. And that in no small part down the Tom Holland: having an actor the correct age range to be Peter Parker is so refreshing and makes the character way more relatable. Because that's the allure of Spider-man he is a kid with everyday problems who just happens to have super powers, that down to earth style. 
Speaking of down to earth, Michael Keaton's villain is more grounded he doesn't want to take over the world; he's just stealing stuff from Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) because he took away his job- there's no sky beam, so thumbs up for that. <br/><br/>And yes Robert Downey Jr. is fun in this movie so is Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau), totally not necessary other than giving Peter a mentor figure but fun nonetheless. Spider-man Homecoming is actually a very funny movie as well Peter's friend Ned (Jacob Batalon) gets some good lines, and I even liked Flash Thompson (Tony Revolori). I liked they changed his character slightly from being a huge muscle bound bully, to a snarky annoying douchebag.
Homecoming also has a lot of downturn moments with Peter just in High School doing everyday things, which might turn of younger viewers because they wanna see Spider-man doing Spider-man things. But these moments can be a lot of fun and gives us more insight to the other side of the Spider-man persona. <br/><br/>I only have a couple of issues with Homecoming. This is a Sony movie so there's quite a bit of product placement in fact the alternative name for Homecoming is Spider-man Go Buy an Audi. They also seem extremely pleased that they are part of the MCU now with just a tad too many references to the wider world, which I get why but becomes a bit of an annoyance at times. And finally the exact same issue I had with Wonder Women, the final fight takes place at night... Again. In fact this fight is even more difficult to work out at times as it takes place in the air with dull flashing lights, and then it moves to a beach in front of an amusement park... Why wasn't the fight inside the amusement park? Isn't that an unwritten law of movies- if there's an amusement park you have a fight scene in it? <br/><br/>Anywho, Spider-man Homecoming is a really enjoyable Spider-man movie with some great performances and it's super awesome that we have an appropriately aged actor playing part, it may sound like a small thing to focus on but it really does impact the role of Spider-man greatly. <br/><br/>I give Spider-man Homecoming a B+."

","Many will say Marvel have hit the mark once again and in some ways they have. This movie most likely will appeal to many and especially to the younger Marvel universe fans. Unfortunately for myself I just found Mark Holland's Spider-Man annoying, which was a disappointment because he nailed Spider-Man in the Avengers. Too be fair Mark's acting has little to do with the character being annoying. I guess I found Spider-Man's witty banter to miss the mark and the way Jon Watts chose to film the movie from the view of a mobile phone, fell flat for me. Still an ok movie it has a solid storyline and some greats action scenes, Robert Downey Jr is great as Tony Stark yet again but I think for my liking Mark Holland's Spiderman really needs the whole team behind him to make his witty remarks work other wise it just becomes too much. As a stand alone character he is one of my least favourite Spider-Mans. Sorry"

","I'm willing to forgive some of the bad cause I know they have to be different from the other films. The worst case is Flash Thompson who instead of being a jock is a nerdy guy who is actually smaller than Peter. And just acts rudely most of the time. This guy is not going to be at all like the guy in the comics who after Highschool joined the marines and became a war hero. Also the reason he hates Peter is because Peter is better at answering questions in class and in physics bowel than he is. I'm not kidding.<br/><br/>Peter has s a friend named Ned who resembles nothing of Ned Leeds the only Spidey character with said name. He really is some character from the Ultimate comic Universe named Ganke where he is friends with the newer Spider-Man Miles Morales. Why isn't his name just Ganke? I guess because it's not an American name. <br/><br/>There isn't really any romance in this movie for Peter who keeps having to ditch being with Liz (who is supposed to be similar to Liz Allen in the comics. Though her last name turns out not to be Alle. But I'll get to that in the spoiler section at the end of the review. The other girl Michelle is rather boring and spends most of the film acting like she doesn't want to be in the movie. <br/><br/>Now Michael Keaton as Vulture is awesome. Wish we could see him as a villain more often in movies. I also liked some of his other crew. Shocker wasn't too bad. I look forward to seeing more of him in the next movie. Hope they give him his more classic look later. <br/><br/>Also I will admit I would've rather had Peter be a bit older and if you want to see an adult Peter Parker you probably won't be seeing one for quite a while in the MCU since he's 15 in this movie and will probably be 16 in the next one. <br/><br/>And for those worried about Tony Stark/Iron Man, he is a supporting character but does help Peter out as Iron Man a few times in the movie. But he is only in it maybe 10-15 minutes at the most. Since Peter is only 15 in this he is under supervision by Stark who tells him what he should and shouldn't do as Spider-Man. Over all a 7/10. Way better than the atrocity of Spider-Man 3. I still prefer ASM 1 and 2 though hopefully the next movie might change my mind. Also you might want to skip to end credit scene which contains absolutely nothing interesting."

Okay, we get it! The inconsistencies from Civil War annoyed me. Peter's room is completely different, Spiderman was strong and capable in Civil War, but in Homecoming he's a clumsy clown who cant do anything right, why did they change the holy ---- line in the blog? I never liked the Homecoming title. It's so cheesy. The political agenda was so unnecessary. The built by slaves line and the cowboys and Indians line made me cringe as well as that eye rolling Ferris Bueller reference.

","""If you're nothing without the suit, then you shouldn't have it."" Tony Stark to his intern, Peter Parker/Spider-Man.<br/><br/>If a superhero film such as Spider-Man: Homecoming can relay that being yourself is more important than being somebody, Director John Watts (director of the under-appreciated Cop Car with Kevin Bacon) and his crew of bright writers have succeeded. I don't remember enjoying more such a focused, albeit young, Peter Parker/Spiderman (Tom Holland), whose emotional problems are those of any teen and not overly driven by angst over a girl, as Tobey Maguire so often portrayed.<br/><br/>While Peter experiences the challenges of teen love and Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.), the film keeps it personal by having fewer explosions and more introspection. Emphasizing Peter's existential responsibility to forge his own character makes this film a cut above even the estimable Wonder Woman this summer.<br/><br/>The spot-on humor is better than any other superhero adventure in memory, and I'm a big Deadpool fan. The difference is that Spidey humor is organic, emanating from the foibles and insecurities of a teen, while in Deadpool practically every other line is witty and seems the product of set pieces. In Spidey, for instance, Ned (Jacob Batalon) asks Spidey, ""Can you summon an army of spiders?"" That's teen to teen with absurdity and worship as comedic ingredients.<br/><br/>In a fine bad-guy performance by Michael Keaton, playing Adrien Toombs, the writers give him the identity of Vulture, appropriate to an actor known for his portrayal of Birdman and reminiscent of Batman. Anyway, alluding to his most famous roles, the film has fun while enhancing the richness of the character.<br/><br/>At times it almost seems that Toombs is there to lend some gravity, albeit villainous, to the light-hearted proceedings. When he lectures his crew about the ruling-class indifference, he's not just talking about Brooklyn; he's referring to the world: ""The rich, the powerful, like Stark, they don't care about us! The world's changed boys, time we change too!""<br/><br/>Spider-Man: Homecoming is a fitting companion this summer to a distaff heroine, Wonder Woman. Unfortunately, Spidey is not all laughs, for Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) tells Peter about adolescence while she unwittingly comments on his heroic burden: ""You need to stop carrying the weight of the world on your shoulders."""
"trublu215","8","10","41","30 June 2017"," The Best Spider-Man Film in Quite Some Time (Maybe Even Ever)
","Spider-Man: Homecoming pits Peter Parker against The Vulture in Marvel's latest adaptation of its oldest and most recognizable hero. Directed by Jon Watts and starring Tom Holland, Michael Keaton, Robert Downey, Jr and Zendaya, the film relies on both CGI and heartfelt performances to make it work and it most certainly works way more than it doesn't. Despite some irritating comedy and an odd performance from Zendaya, Spider- Man: Homecoming is one of the better MCU films that will surely enjoy some love from fan's and audiences alike.<br/><br/>First off, the film is a very easy and definitely the most accessible Spider-Man film. There really isn't anything new to see here regarding story. Like DC's Batman, Spider-Man's backstory is common knowledge at this point and the film doesn't waste too much time on telling it. I'm shocked that a third rendition of Spider-Man was able to be thrilling again let alone interesting. So much so that the fact that it managed to hold my attention even through the same story is a helluva feat that Watts captured beautifully. While I really liked the way this film told it's story, I wasn't so much a fan of the humor of the film.<br/><br/>The humor used began as light but was then relied on a little too much. While we all have grown accustomed to Robert Downey Jr as Tony Stark and his incredibly snarky wit, the humor was less welcomed with the supporting cast especially with Zendaya as Michelle. Michelle is a really awkward character that could have benefited from either better dialog or a better actress to land those comedic moments better. Either way, the character and performance didn't bode well with me but the audience seemed to enjoy her quite a bit. Personally, as far as humor was concerned, Jon Favreau as Happy was the source of my entertainment as he is in it a surprising amount of time and doesn't disappoint. As for the rest of the cast, all were pretty standard for a comic book film outside of Tom Holland.<br/><br/>Tom Holland is superb as Peter Parker. He brings a light to the character that has been missing from all the previous cinematic renditions. It's pretty simple...Holland plays Parker as he is written: a teenage kid. He really does embody what it means to be Peter Parker and relishes in the performance. It's not over the top, it's played just right. And with a great hero, there's a great villain. Michael Keaton is tremendously menacing as Adrian Toomes aka Vulture. He really lays on the sinister nature of the character and the scenes that he shares with Holland are very good.<br/><br/>Overall, Spider-Man: Homecoming is probably the best rendition of the titular character that audiences have seen. Tom Holland and Michael Keaton are tremendous in the film along with much of the supporting cast. Jon Watts delivers to audiences what any up and coming director could ever hope for: a really enthralling and invigorating summer blockbuster. Homecoming is bound to go down as one of the finer installments of the MCU and one of the best blockbusters of 2017."

"jdr_ph","5","3","8","23 October 2017"," Raimi did it best
","Okay, I know I am an old Asian fart, but I don't care how many millennials feel about Raimi's versions. For me, Spiderman 1 and 2 are still the best and until now the scenes of those movies are very memorable. Not everything is CGI or costumes or realistic lines. For me,superhero movies should not take themselves seriously but at the same time not be a bag of jokes all the time. I really wanted to give the new versions of Spiderman some chance. I watched Amazing Spiderman and regretted it so I didn't watch the second of that supposedly trilogy. For this latest version, I was hoping against hope that the detractors were just mostly DC fans so I gave it try. Turned out to be that many Spiderman fans like felt that a lot of things were forced, especially the diversity issue (And I am Asian). I am not pro-DC or pro-Marvel. I have my favorite superheroes from each universe. This movie just shows me that Raimi really left a mark. The fact that they made the villain the father of someone close to Peter's heart felt like Spiderman 1 all over again. I get it that the new generation may want something different but for me, there is nothing wrong with sticking to one's race if the writer is white with his own point of view in the first place. As an Asian, I don't think a remake of ONCE UPON IN CHINA needs a black kung fu master, a white bald kung fu sidekick or a South American gay love interest to make it a good film that represents almost all nationalities. I am tired of the PC culture. I am not watching a political show. We cannot represent everyone in a movie. And I don't mind if the race is homogenous in a movie, especially when the era represents a certain period. Good thing that NYC is quite diverse so in this movie it is acceptable but, still, we know the hidden agenda why these different nationalities were present in this latest version of Spiderman. Just like blacks became equal citizens of 19th century French society in BEAUTY AND THE BEAST when they were actually slaves at that time. Art should not always try to be political even though some artists are political in their approach. However, there is also the art for art's sake point of view. That is why I am rewatching old films and TV series on YT nowadays because I feel that they have more to say about life in general than what I am seeing now which tends to be about the same issue about diversity and being PC. Good Grief!"
"bunchcooper-74140","7","3","8","11 July 2017"," Amazing but missing things that are Spectacular
","This film was excellent. They nailed Spider-Man's humor to the core. Tom Holland did fantastic, it was great to see someone in their teens as Spider-Man and not in their twenties. Although Toby McGuire did an excellent job in his movies and Garfield did a solid performance especially in the sequel. <br/><br/>Although Spider Man was great with his humor as we all know and love, we did not see the classic Spider-Man morals that true fans live for. No ""With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility"" was a big disappointment. Also no sign of Uncle Ben was a big bummer as well. I wish Spider-Man saw his reflection in the puddle instead of hearing Stark's voice. We didn't even see a glimpse of Uncle Ben. I wish we could of seen him on screen just for a little bit. Although it lacked classic morals we definitely did see the wall crawler go through other struggles and trying to over come them. <br/><br/>The villains were pretty tight. I just hope they really stick with the source material more. That's SO IMPORTANT. I was so glad to see Shocker make an appearance. Just give him his suit please! And if J Jonah Jameson isn't the one to give scorpion his suit then I will be extremely disappointed and upset.<br/><br/>Now I just have to talk about how PC this movie is. Some of it was great and some of it was not. It was Awesome to see how diverse the school was. Diversity is a great thing. I went to a high school that was 80% more diverse than any other schools around town and it was a great time. I love to see Parker's friend as Filipino and other classmates as well. However I do not like changing appearances when it comes to the source material. Flash Thompson is bigger and more of a jock. However in this movie he is tiny, puny, more so than Peter Parker. He is not that intimidating. And he is incredibly smart too? That's not Flash. And if Michelle is actually MJ then I will be furious. MJ is a peppy loving figure to Parker. She's not an emotionless introverted girl that sits in detention for fun just to draw people. She was just such a weird character. ""I'm not going inside a place that was built by slaves."" Ooooh like that is going to change anything. Slavery IS THE MOST shameful act this country has done. What a blessing from God it was when it was abolished in the 1800s. But not admiring something or visiting something just because slaves were involved is absurd. You can admire a historical structure and still be opposed to slavery even when slaves were involved. I guess Michelle is opposed to visiting the White House, Capitol Building, trains, Wall Street, etc. Some parts of history sucks but it can't be changed.<br/><br/>Again, I find changing character's appearances from the original source material is ridiculous. Stick with the main source! Respect it! And this doesn't make me a racist either. I was just as disappointed when they changed a major figure in The Walking Dead Comics from a black male to a white woman in the TV show. I also would love to see a Green Lantern Movie with John Stewart (The black green lantern) and not Hal Jordan. Also Aunt May should be a lot older.<br/><br/>It was a bummer to see how many people have figured out Spider Man's identity already. Especially the Vulture and Aunt May. No Villain should figure out his identity and especially not Aunt May! Especially in the beginning! <br/><br/>Now one thing that personally bothered me was the way they cut to the credits. I've been making a script since 2015 and it pretty much has the same ending. I wrote the ending where a character stares in disbelief and yells ""What the F-!"" And cuts to credits with a catchy song (Not telling the name of the song). I can't believe they had the same idea! I hope if my movie comes to life they won't think I'm getting the scene from this movie.<br/><br/>Overall this movie was a fun experience. It was written well for the most part. Just stick more to the source material!"
"metalrage666","6","3","8","10 July 2017"," Not bad, but not great either.
","They keep trying and somehow failing to get certain iconic characters just right. Whether it be Superman, Batman, X-men and now Spider- man, they love churning out various incarnations of all these characters, but they seem to let personal artistic flair or license get in the way of just telling a simple straightforward story while staying faithful to the source material.<br/><br/>I get that Spider-man Homecoming wanted to re-shift the focus away from the grandiose city levelling action we've come accustomed to in prior Marvel outings, and this was more about a teenager, struggling to come to grips with his new-found powers, his responsibilities of crime fighting and realising he still has a lot of growing up to do, but if they took all the best parts of the last 5 or 6 Spider-man movies, we wouldn't have an Amazing Spider-man, we'd have a Spectacular Spider- man instead.<br/><br/>Of the things I'm thankful for in Homecoming, was that we did not have to sit through yet another origin story of Peter being bitten by a spider and realising ""hey I'm a kid with powers, let's go and fight crime"", instead of what would really happen; ""Hey I have powers, I'm going to do the stuff I've always wanted to, get revenge on everyone who wronged me and live like a god"". Other elements I'm thankful for, were some of the action scenes with The Vulture, the way the Vulture was developed, Peter's first crush with Liz Allen, the team ups with Iron Man and the light-hearted humour. But for me there was still a whole lot lacking in this that makes Spider-Man the hero he's supposed to be.<br/><br/>We know that Marvel did a deal with Sony to have the rights to incorporate Spider-Man into the MCU and as a part-time Avenger and that for continuity purposes they re-work many of the character backgrounds to fit the premise in live action films, but there is so much that they either left out or deliberately ignored altogether. I never knew Spider-Man to have a tech suit designed by Tony Stark complete with a head-up display or detachable remote spider drone that somehow fits snugly into a fabric suit. The whole idea was that Peter Parker was supposed to develop his suit, his web shooters & the web fluid all by himself. This version would have us believe that without Tony Stark there'd never be a Spider-Man wearing anything else other than a make-shift blue and red tracksuit. <br/><br/>Other things that bugged me in this was that Spider-Man has no Spider-sense, how is he supposed to be able to see danger coming before it happens? DOes he have to rely on Stark tech for that too? Flash Thompson; Peter Parker's high school nemesis, was supposed to be a bully and also a jock, not a persnickety and sarcastic member of the ""Mathletes"" or whatever they were. He was supposed to make Peter's life hell at school, not just mildly annoy him with jibes. Why this character was re-tooled is beyond me. I certainly can't see this nothing guy be successful at being Agent Venom. Aunt May played by Marisa Tomei is far too young and not the right fit to portray the ageing good-natured retiree that Peter's Aunt is supposed to be. The depiction of secondary villains, Shocker and Scorpion are lame perhaps what I'd expect from a haphazard DC movie like Suicide Squad, (where villains rarely resemble who they're supposed to be) and not from a big budget and usually well arranged Marvel movie.<br/><br/>Homecoming is certainly enjoyable and a fun ride, but if you're a massive fan expecting to finally see Spider-Man how he's supposed to be, then you're going to see this as a disappointment. Anybody else will most likely love this as a decent addition to the MCU."

Not only is it a great movie overall, filled with action, lots of comedy (let's not forget amazing scenes between Holland and RDJ), and even a little romance. But it finally gives fans the perfect combination of Peter Parker AND Spiderman! Tom Holland's performance is real and authentic, giving the audience a 15yo who is having the time of his life being a superhero. He fails, and makes mistakes. He doesn't know the meaning of limits and believes he can do anything as long as he has the suit. However, he is charming, and sweet, and gets nervous around girls and he LEARNS in time what it really means to be a hero! Yes, the movie has flaws, but they all do. Homecoming is beautifully done, and amazingly written. It introduces a new generation to Spiderman, the friendly neighborhood hero, in the most accurate way possible. It stays true to the comics and to who Peter Parker really is. I can't wait to see Peter's next adventure and encourage everyone to go see this movie! Definitely one of Marvel's best!

Well, I almost did, but a few scenes brought me out of the movie and the whole ""I want to be an avenger"" at the start of the movie gets a little bit too much. Also there is not that much action. I assume many Americans will give this movie a lower score because it is not ""fast paced"" enough for them, but I can agree slightly. I would have been fun to see at least 1-2 more action scenes. <br/><br/>As a superhero movie within the genre this is a week 10, which in my book make this top 3 best superhero movies of all time, perhaps even the best ever. I need to see the movie a couple of more times before I make a final judgment. As a movie this is decently solid 9 on the slight weak side.

They make Aunt May and his suit computer unbelievable May acts like a shy/clever sexy, the suit computer takes things personal which is generic. They try WAY too hard to make this enjoyable for really young kids, and miss the comic book fans for years. It seriously lacks good directing writing and producing. It is no where near the dynamic and humor enjoyed with the Avengers movies and others. The Toby/Garfield movies were better. I LOVE Marvel and I have seen them all and am a big fan of many, but the directing & producing with Spiderman in the Avengers movie was way way better. It is too bad, I looked forward to this. It seems a lot of people are helping to swing the ratings to get people to go, I will just say.... wait to see it for free or for a 1.59 fee or something 2 thumbs and a heart down.

The problem is that Spider-Man seemed like the one giant Marvel hero who had more dimensions to him than anyone else because his identity is secret. He's got actual tragedy in his past that he couldn't fire laser beams at. And he's just a kid who had to grow up real fast. By sanding down a lot of the things that made him so relatable, and relegating the Peter Parker side to simply a series of things he's going to have to ditch and then say sorry to is both annoying and frustrating as someone who wants to be given any reason to care at all about the hundredth Marvel movie to be released in 15 years. The fact that the character is also ""the acrobatic one"" of the heroes means most of the scenes translate to watching animated computer figures bounce around for long stretches, which didn't help either.

","Spider-Man: Homecoming was different from what I was expecting the film was going to be. I was so used to the origin of Spider-Man that I was expecting the original story. But There was no story plot of Peter Parker getting bit by a radioactive spider and/or the death of Ben Parker. Which in my opinion was interesting! Because in this film it already happened. I loved how it took place after Captain America: Civil War (2016) and for the first time in history, Spidey is back in the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) which was really exciting for a fan like me! It was a total blast with humor and action sequences! And for a long time fan like me, I loved It! it was hard for me to decide if it was good. Watching the film really gave me a big thought. But I'd give it two thumbs up! If you are a Spidey fan out there you would not want to miss this film!"
"supermaggie","3","3","9","13 February 2018"," Hollywoods descent goes on and on
","Hollywood only knows two themes anymore: xenophobia (preferrably towards Germany) and the disassembly of their own legacy (or a combination of both). The new Spider-Man - if you can call it that - belongs to the second category, which is the less bad category, but still gives no cause for delight. As I bought this new installation due to the loyalty to the character, I was unaware that it was a parody of Spider-Man, not one of the funny Scary Movie kind, or the charming, intended way like the first Spider-Man movies were, but in the poor, involuntary way. Nothing is left of the movie-character Spider-Man that audiences all around the world have come to know and love. Instead, it is respectless and tasteless against DC's Flash with a character of this name which counterpoints Peter Parker as an annoying (Guatemalan) classmate. But if you want to pull the hell out of Flash, it's all the more astonishing that (the iconic, red-haired Mary-Jane has been eliminated or - transformed into an African American - demoted to a short appearance (revealed only in the end), and instead) they operate with Liz as Peter's heartthrob, who is an almost identical copy of the annoying/arrogant Iris of The Flash, but apparently the pretension of a non-racist casting (which it is actually not, exactly because color does play the most important role in casting - and by no means Hollywood casts color-blindly and only for the amount of fitness to the character in question) outweighs all other motives. Accordingly - while German villains e. g. are beaten to pulp accompanied by joy and applause in American movies - it is equally ridiculous that in the end the villain who has already killed and has also tried several times to kill Spider-Man, is spared by the same, yes, even saved. All for the appearance of a moral that could not be more hypocritical and that Hollywood has long lost. And even the much too young Marisa Tomei (whom I adore, but here she does not fit) seems completely out of place as aunt May and leaves you sadly missing Rosemary Harris. For the sake of fairness, positive innovations include well-cast school friend Ned, the cute little drone, and the (unfortunately very short) performances of Tyne Daly and Logan Marshall-Green. All in all, a (nowadays typical) Hollywood development for the worse. Hollywood is on a descent and accelerates this development with full consciousness and will. I know I will not hold my breath until the next Marvel or Spider-Man movie comes out - oh, and who, by the way, wants to see Thor with short hair? Everything has become utterly ridiculous."

It's like Spider-Man for Dummies. It tries way too hard to be funny, and it's just not. Marisa Tomei is totally wasted in this mess. I'm not sure what demographic this film is aimed at, but whatever it is, I'm definitely not in it. Rather than fast-paced drama, this film screams: TAKE YOUR ADDERALL ALREADY!

"alinfatu","9","3","9","8 July 2017"," Best Spider-Man to hit the big screen
","I was introduced to the character by the 90's animated series.Ever since I started reading comics and search for a good live action movie.And finally I found it now.<br/><br/>The plot represents the story and journey of Peter Parker after the events of Civil War and how he grew to embrace his destiny as the hero who looks after ""the little guy"".<br/><br/>As far as the characters go the most noticeable 2 are: <br/><br/>1)Peter Parker.Tom Holland was perfect for the role.He not only embraced the physicality of the role but he is also able to carry this movie. Thanks to his range he can act a scene out very well,delivering emotional lines intensely.He plays a geeky,hot,a little naive but very gold heart-ed Peter,as he was supposed to be since his creation,who cares about those around him,a good example would be him avoiding to tell May about his super-hero alter ego because it might hurt her after all her loss and strives to do the right thing even if he end up getting hurt,for example, when he saved his collages from the explosion at the Washington Monument.His Spider-Man strong, agile,witty, sarcastic, full of bad puns as he was always supposed to be.Even when he is not believed and taken into consideration because he is young,he puts his life on the line to protect those who he loves and everyone in Queens,people he feels are under his protection.I like that he never gives up,especially when adults dis him.His journey reflects the not so conventional journey of a teenager who wakes up with the powers to make a difference and has to also cope with his adolescent life,which in everyone's life is a curfew to deal with. <br/><br/>2)Adrian Toomes/The Vulture.Coming from a minimalist background with a strong sense for care for those around him,this man decides to start a criminal life by selling weapons he made with alien technology in order to keep his team employed and able to provide for their families .He is the brain of the operation and takes up a new name while building himself a name into the criminal world,the Vulture.He is not pure evil,his motivation is to provide and offer a happy life for his daughter,Liz Allen and his co-workers families.He is a man of his word and for being saved by Spider-Man,he does not disclose his identity to the Scorpion.The scene where he discovers who Peter actually is was marvelous and proved the intelligence and the dominance of Keaton's character. <br/><br/>The secondary characters have a place,but just about 4 have a job to fulfill:<br/><br/>1)RDJ as Tony Stark.Surprisingly likable in this movie,he takes his role as the mentor of peter very seriously.He becomes very heart warmed towards Peter after he realize how rude he was by taking his suit away.Their relationship is starting to shape and in the future they might become closer. Other than that,he had horrible puns towards May,he acted rudely to peter after the ferry affair and he did not even bother to try to understand him at his most vulnerable moment. <br/><br/>2)Jon Favreau as Happy Hogan was fantastic if the idea was to make him a total douche.I hated how he ignored Peter all the time,did not even try to listen to him even after Tony specifically put him there just to do it. <br/><br/>3)Marissa Tomei was a modern,likable,cool aunt May who drives her life as best as she can to raise her nephew and to cope with the death of her husband.For the first time this character felt like an aunt and not a grandma. <br/><br/>3)Jacob Batalon as Ned was funny,caring and a good ,overall, who as every teenager wanted to be cool and admired but gave it up in order to respect his best friend wish.<br/><br/>My complaints about the movie: <br/><br/>1)Tony Revolori was horrible as Flash,did not embody any characteristic of his character,had 1 single tired joke during the movie and was interested in science?He came out mostly as an annoying nuisance than a bully.Same goes for Zendaya as MJ,her character was annoying,served no purpose,she was put there for nothing.<br/><br/>2)The 8 years gap:Avengers came out in 2012,the after 8 years makes no sense,as it should have put the movie events in 2020 while it takes place in present day,2017.Linearity was a problem here. 3)The school kids were not used all that much.<br/><br/>Cameos and after credits: I loved seeing Pepper Pots again.The actress and RDJ had a better chemistry here,I felt,then ever before.I hope she is here to stay,at least for the minimal appearance. The post credit scene was a total lesson of patience by Captain America.They rick-rolled us,big time."
"bodhi-13262","8","3","9","7 July 2017"," ""With great POWER......comes a GREAT f#%king movie!!!.""
","'Spider-Man: Homecoming' unleashes a whole new bag of tricks as the webcrawler swings his way back onto the silver-screen, but this time......he's (finally) part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. With Sam Raimi's 2002 film and it's sequel being the most highly praised incarnations of the character, does Spidey have a successful rebooted homecoming?<br/><br/>1. Following the events of 'Captain America: Civil War', Peter Parker (Tom Holland) returns home (after his bout with the Avengers) to fight crime in his neighborhood of Queens NY with a brand new/hi- tech spidey-suit courtesy of Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) himself. Eager to impress Mr. Stark and join the Avengers, Peter unexpectedly crosses paths with the ruthless Vulture (Michael Keaton) and his associates, who are hell-bent on stealing parts and manufacturing advanced weaponry to sell on the black market for millions. For the most part, I had no problem whatsoever with the plot and found myself utterly compelled by the story even though it was quite simple.<br/><br/>2. As much of the Tobey MaGuire fan I am, all props to Tom Holland. He highly impressed me with his short stint in 'Civil War', but now he has proved why he is the definitive Spider-Man. Never before has the character been this true to his comic-book incarnation. Holland portrays him with just the right amount of humor, quirkiness and level of emotion that the character of Peter Parker truly is. Even though you see him appear in all the trailers, Robert Downey Jr. isn't in a majority of the film as it would seem. He serves just the right amount of screen-time while playing the pivotal role of Peter's mentor. Also, Zendaya's character of Michelle doesn't have a large role in this either.<br/><br/>3. She obviously will play a bigger role in the sequel, but as for now, she gets about several minutes of screen-time total. Laura Harrier (Liz) however, is more of the female lead in this (next to Marisa Tomei), as Peter's love-interest. Jacob Batalon fills the comedic shoes as Peter's best friend Ned. The two have great chemistry and they both add most of the humor in this film. Jon Favreau returns as Happy Hogan, who's job this time around is to baby-sit and monitor Peter to ensure he doesn't get himself into trouble......which he ultimately does lol. The main thing is that they all feel like real people dealing with real-life problems at times which everyone can relate to.<br/><br/>4. You can't have a great Hero without a great villain, and Michael Keaton hits a home-run as the film's antagonist Adrian Toomes/The Vulture. He's scary, ruthless and yet you still sympathize for him when you learn about his motives. Apart from Sebastian Stan as 'The Winter Soldier', Keaton stands out as one of the better villains the MCU has delivered thus far. Bokeem Woodbine appears as the secondary antagonist Herman Sholtz/The Shocker, and there are hints of other popular Spider-Man villains, but this review is spoiler free so I won't name them of course:) As shown in the trailers, Chris Evans does make a few cameo appearances as Steve Rogers/Captain America, but only in some funny P.E. instructional videos.<br/><br/>5. The dialogue is very humorous as it should be and the editing gives the film a nice flow to where I didn't feel the length. All of the action sequences were surprisingly great, especially scenes with the Vulture. It's fun to watch Spidey screw up, but he is amazing when it comes to all his spectacular stunts and web-slinging. The film isn't flawless though. Marisa Tomei felt underwritten to where she was a little too forgiving of her nephew's suspicious behavior/antics and once again, she never comes across as anyone's aunt. The climax was great, although I felt it refused to take an emotional approach and instead ended it generically. The very last scene of the film was pretty cheesy to be honest.<br/><br/>The movie sets up a (respective) sequel but it doesn't aim toward 'Infinity War' as one might think. There is an unexpected cameo by a female character with hints of previous MCU films throughout, so pay attention. Director Jon Watts does an excellent job here, and this is the kind of superhero flick that I would pay to see again."
"luigi-santos17","9","3","9","7 July 2017"," Fresh take on an overused universe, feels brand new again. Awesome Spider with even more potential to be a real flagship.
","Honestly, the trailers put down my expectations a little bit so the quality of the movie was a nice surprise. It's a teen Spidey that really looks the part, it's basically a teen movie and yet it doesn't feel like one. The decision to use almost no character from the other universes was so good, as it made it fresher and easier to feel interested in getting to know these new people. Maybe once or twice I felt that a joke broke the tension unnecessarily, but more than any other character from MCU, the fun vibe matches the hero.<br/><br/>Peter is very inexperienced here and it really shows, it can be a buzzkill to some, but for me it made way more sense than recently gaining powers and reaching peak performance in a couple weeks. This inexperience also culminates in Spidey not actually beating the bad guy, the Vulture (awesome villain by the way) just keeps pushing the limits of his suit until it fails him, which is something that I kind of liked for making sense in Peter the kid not beating the super strong villain with just the power of determination, but I confess I missed a little more punchy action.<br/><br/>I'm a fan of the comics and Spider-man was always my favorite underdog, and it finally feels like that comic adaptation I've been waiting for. Hopefully this universe keeps it up, and we might get to see Peter grow to be that awesome hero we love."

","To me, Spider-Man 2 (Sam Raimi) is still the best Spider-Man film to date. With that being said, this was a good film; I don't know if I'd classify it as ""great"" but I definitely had a fun time watching it and will likely see it again. It uses the typical MCU formula, which has worked well for them but a part of me wishes that there were more lasting stakes in their films; hopefully we'll see that when Infinity War rolls around. Overall, I'm going to give it a 7/10."
"hammerhorg","6","2","5","17 June 2019"," Meh
","I mean it could be Worse, to be honest with you Homecoming has a pretty mediocre story, some ok actions scenes, overuse of CGI and great acting.
I think were the film suffers the most is the storyline. The storyline is pretty predictable and i do not think the film needed iron man.
There are some jokes which weren't that bad and i love Ned, i think micheal Keaton did a spectacular job as the vulture and I think Tom holland is not that bad of a spider-man.<br/><br/>This movie was not as good as the first two Spider-man films or i do not think it's better than The Amazing Spider-Man films.
The film is very Forgettable and I think The MCU's interpretation of spider-man is a lot better as a supporting character than a main.
I think the plot twist at the end was not that bad, and it kind of gets to you when Liz has to move out of town because his dad is vulture and it's Spider-Man fault, that kind of gets you.<br/><br/>All Around i think it is a Ok movie and is just a filler for the MCU."
"stevenaisbitt","3","2","5","10 June 2019"," I preferred Andrew Garfield's Peter Parker
","Congratulations Sony and Columbia, you've turned Spider-Man into the over-chatty clown of the MCU. I didn't like Tom Holland's portrayal of Parker in Captain America: Civil War, finding him frankly obnoxious. I thought I'd give this a try however. It gets three stars, and that's me being generous. These are for inventiveness and Michael Keaton's 'villain' who I actually sympathized with, given his narrative. The final of the three stars comes from Jennifer Connelly's enlivening voice over turn as the AI in Parker's Stark Industries manufactured Spider-Man suit. Who wouldn't want JC's dulcet tones in their head?
And since when was Tony Stark Peter Parker's mentor and master-at-arms?
I still prefer Sony's previous short-lived Spider-Man series with Andrew Garfield."

"arghya-01497","6","2","5","20 October 2017"," Changes are for good! Are they really?
","When a movie is being made with a widely popular, hugely acknowledged character like Spiderman, comparisons have become unavoidable. When films are being made with a character over a considerable period of time, changes are to be made as per the requirements of time. But the basic things are expected to remain the same. With the recent movie, the Marvels studios have made some significant changes. First, be the Spider suit. Well, previously the suits were made by Peter Parker himself. But now it is made by Stark industries. Now the suit is suggesting Parker what to do or what not to. An unacceptable and totally unnecessary change for a spider man lover. He should be spider man because of him, not for the suit. Secondly, the never forgettable acting skills of Toby Maguire. No one really interested what spider man does with the mask because all the stunts are done with stuntman or special effects. Showing the emotions, the frustrations, require really good acting skills and were successfully done by Toby Maguire. We love him because with his acting skills he made us feel that he is one of us. Thirdly, why the first 40 to 45 minutes of the movie is made such a way is beyond any comprehension. Any Spiderman lover would like to leave the hall or turn the channel. It is such a pain to see such bogus, useless, needless comedy that leads to nowhere, for such a long period of time.<br/><br/>Last but not the least is Rosemary Harris. Everybody need a mentor. Specially for someone who fights to keep the society clean, needs a shelter to go to. He needs someone who is waiting in the home only for him. He needs someone to give right advice in the time of confusion. At least that was the way Marvel made us to believe in previous superhero movies. That someone is Aunt May for Peter. Though she does not know of Peter being the Spiderman but gives right advice when needed. Who can forget the scene when Spiderman killed the killer of his uncle and Peter proudly says this to his Aunt , she instantly says "" I don't understand. Spiderman does not kill people"", the way she said that gave Peter his conscience back to made him realize that he really made a terrible mistake. These were made possible by the acting skills of Rosemary Harris. Scenes of Peter and aunt Mary are unforgettable in those movies. They were like conversions between mother and child. In this movie this important character has been downgraded. It has been portrayed in a manner that any Spiderman lover would definitely feel that the movie would better have been made without aunt May. <br/><br/>Most of all Spiderman does not need someone like Iron man to be his mentor. Only because they have to include Spiderman in the Avengers movie, Marvel Studios have made Spiderman like this. An unacceptable CHANGE. Spiderman is the Spiderman. Should have better been left unchanged."
"TalulaGrey","4","2","5","13 October 2017"," Mediocre
","I went to see this film the other day and was surprised at how much I didn't enjoy it. The actors all did a fine job, because, yes, they can act; and the costume/set/cgi/effects were pretty good.<br/><br/>I am sad to say that I didn't enjoy the scenes with Tom Holland (Peter Parker). Tom is a fine actor but he is not a fine Spiderman. While watching his scenes I kept thinking he sounds as though he's a whiny 12 year old and his only saving grace were his scenes with Jacob Batalon (Peter's best friend).<br/><br/>I wanted to like this movie. I found some of it okay, but most of it was mediocre. Children under 13 will enjoy it... I think?"
"guisreis","5","2","5","9 October 2017"," The worst Spiderman movie
","Just the last two sentences of this review may be considered as spoiler. Let's begin: This is the worst official Spiderman movie ever produced. Indeed, it is much more a mix of a silly high school film and a Iron Man film. This Spiderman has very little of Spiderman. First of all, instead of having extreme reflexes, he is quite clumsy, what is nonsense and made the film a bad slapstick comedy. Besides that, what the hell is that Iron Man-like suit with many powers not traditionally related to the spider? Therefore, the fact that this is not really a Spiderman film is bad enough not to consider it a good movie. Though, there are many other problems: most of the action scenes are confusing (like the scenes Transformers franchise bad recent films use to have), there is an excess of jokes with more than 90% of them being bad and silly, acting is unconvincing for most of the main roles (Michael Keaton is clearly an exception)... The movie gets better in the final part, but it is definitely not enough to save it. SPOILER ALERT: By the way: MJ's name is Michelle? Really?!"
"preben_hassel","8","2","5","4 October 2017"," I don't care about the crying fanboys, I loved it.
","Spiderman is back with a new face, a new suit and a whole lot of new problems. Finally, we received what we cried out for. Spidermans REAL introduction to the Avengers universe. <br/><br/>At first I was very skeptical to the fact that Tom Holland was to become the new Spiderman, but after a brief taste of his character in Civil War(2016) I decided to give him a shot, of which he passed.<br/><br/>The build-up of the movie itself is very similar to the previous movies, with a backstory of the villain that keeps evolving into something personal. But this time, not only does the villain have the high tech equipment, so does our hero (Thanks to a certain genius billionaire playboy and philanthropist)<br/><br/>Not surprisingly does Tony Stark appears several times in the movie, but just enough to not steal the show entirely.<br/><br/>Overall it's a good addition to the marvel series, more specifically the Avengers bundle. I don't really understand a lot of the criticism coming from the fanboys, and I recommend everyone who's a fan of the movies to give it a watch."
"gmwatling","8","2","5","19 September 2017"," Smashed It!
","Although I have rated this film an 8 out of 10, I feel personally that it is a 10 out of 10 but there is something about it that makes me only give it an 8 out of 10. I personally loved the film and thought that it was amazing it never once lost my attention and I was laughing the whole way though it. I don't really have a bad thing to say about it as a film. It is a family friendly film that I would highly recommend to anyone who has not seen this yet. As a teenager my self, who is roughly the same age as Spiderman in the film, it is easy to relate to as he is in school and is having trouble getting the girl of his dreams, however he is not the broad bravo that catches her eye all the time.

I am definitely looking forward to seeing Tom Holland return as Spiderman in his next movie."
"rodrickEle","7","2","5","26 July 2017"," Enjoyable and... that's all.
","A good movie is that one that grabs the audience from the very beginning and engages them fully throughout its duration on the screen. Spiderman movie is correct in most aspects, but somehow, at times, I found myself thinking about the technicalities of filming rather than feeling completely immersed in the story. The plot is just not good enough to let you enter and connect fully with the story being told. That might be because I'm not the target audience ‚Äìthe movie is a teenage movie probably targeted to teens‚Äì but that doesn't mean an adult will not enjoy it and have a good time too.<br/><br/>From the technical point of view, the film is excellent, the lighting and camera work gives a realistic feel to the story that helps the viewer to believe whatever happens on the screen. The writing is funny, and got the right rhythm and perfectly mixes comedy and action the way Marvel does so efficiently.<br/><br/>The actors are believable and make the characters to feel real on the screen, although the drama in the story is not enough to engage the audience fully. A little bit of drama would have helped the audience to connect deeper with the characters and would help the story to be more engaging. I'm not a Spiderman fan and I can't really compare this Spiderman to the one in the comic books, but I would agree the movie is a very good depiction of the character as we know from popular culture.<br/><br/>Now I would like to ask myself a few questions; did I enjoy the movie? yes, I did, would I pay to watch it again? yes, maybe, does it entertains? yes, great, is it a classic, a movie you will remember as something which contributed to my knowledge and understanding of the world we live today? no, not really¬Ö But, who cares, this is a product meant to entertain you and have fun, so just sit, relax and enjoy."
"keithbixler","8","2","5","12 July 2017"," A Fresh Spider-Man Movie
","Spider-Man: Homecoming is simply a fun, enjoyable movie to watch. It's very entertaining and Tom Holland does an excellent job bringing both Peter Parker and Spider-Man to life. I grew up with Toby Maguire being Spider-Man but this feels better and more reassuring than The Amazing Spider-Man. It will give more time for Tom Holland to develop the character. Marvel movies usually tend to over due the one-liners but in Spider-Man homecoming it felt better placed because of the High- School setting and they had some very funny and memorable parts. For Spider-Man being a street level hero they captured everything perfectly with the vulture. From start to finish I had a great time watching this film.<br/><br/>My only negative point towards this film was his suit. While it looked great, I think it took away from Spider-Man's abilities. Spider- Man's main focus is his spidy sense and that was no where to be found because of his high-tech suit. I can understand why they did it. It's a suit from Iron Man but they overplayed it just a little but. I hope future films don't rely too much on it.<br/><br/>Overall, this is one of the best marvel films to date with pace, balance, and story line. It's something new we haven't seen in any Spider-Man movie or any Marvel movie."
"FabledGentleman","7","2","5","12 July 2017"," Not very original, but still lots of fun
","I got to hand it to marvel, they manage to spew out one good movie after the other. I don't think i have rated any of their movies bad the last 10 years, but a few have been mediocre.<br/><br/>Spider-man: Homecoming is good, but not exceptional in any way really. What we get is a story about a boy and a girl that is told the exact same way as hundreds of times before it. But even though it is quite predictable and unoriginal it has a lot of entertainment value.<br/><br/>To get some of the bad of my chest. There is not enough screen time for Micheal Keaton in this film, he does so well as vulture, and i just wanted to see more of him. But instead we see too much of his crew. That is a bad move, because this film has a lot to cover in 2 hours, even though we skip everything that made Peter Parker into spider-man in the first place, there is several stories that is being told here.<br/><br/>I think that they did a good job of cramming all the information into the film, but i can't by help thinking, the story should have been different. I just think we spend a little bit too much time with Tony Stark, and much of that time should have been with Keaton.<br/><br/>Tom Holland does a phenomenal job though, he is the right choice to play this role. He has a great wits about him, and he is playful and energetic, and nerdy. All the traits you need from Spidey.<br/><br/>Marisa Tomei is one of my all time favorite actresses, but in this film she doesn't have much to work with. If you have seen Marisa Tomei act, you know how good she is, and it is a real waste of talent to have so little time for her in this film. But since Keaton also has too little time, Marisa should probably just have been dropped from the film all together.<br/><br/>Marvel has done a great thing with the MCU, how they manage to web all these films together and keep it entertaining is truly admirable. But Spider-Man: Homecoming is a bit weaker than films like ""The Avengers"", ""Guardian of the Galaxy"", and ""Captain America: Civil War"". Maybe it also has something to do with all the spider-man films that has been released past 15 years. Maybe they should have just dropped the Andrew Garfield films and given spidey some time to become really interesting again. Because Spider-man: Homecoming feels oddly boring at times, even in some of the action scenes. It's the feeling of ""Been there, done that, seen that"".<br/><br/>But even though the film is weaker than many DCU films, it is not a bad film. It definitely has it's moments, and Holland is really fun to watch. And Keaton is damn good. You get 2 hours of pure entertainment, with all the action you'd expect from a Marvel film. And it is executed quite well, with pretty great cinematography, awesome special effects and great hero music. So the movie is not a downer, plenty to see here for all superhero fans.<br/><br/>7/10 - Good"
"travishouze","7","2","5","10 July 2017"," Spider-Man: Homecoming Spins a New Web
","Only a mere 15 years ago, I was astonished to see Spider-Man's first big appearance on the big screen played by Tobey Maguire. While that trilogy hasn't aged too well, there was a fresh energy still there when superhero films began to take a more human route. The Amazing Spider-Man films, however, lacked any real impact or relevancy for me. So Spider-Man: Homecoming had a lot riding on the film more than just ""we got Spidey home"".<br/><br/>When I saw Tom Holland in CA: Civil War, I felt a breath of fresh air as a younger Spider-Man driven and hungry to prove his abilities. And that driving force in his character is played well throughout the film, even when the film admits he's still very inexperienced and still needs help being in control. Placing him in Queens where the buildings aren't as high so it forces him to stay closer to the ground and have to get around town in his suit like everyone else. Michael Keaton does a solid job as the winged villain (probably his 3rd or 4th or maybe even 20th time playing a winged character in his lifetime), who is a blue collared salvager struggling trying to provide for his family (despite questionably good living conditions that I personally couldn't shake). Luckily Tony Stark's character doesn't stand overarching in the film as much as the trailers make it seem either and does bring some needed father figure dynamic to the MCU.<br/><br/>Zendaya and Jacob Batalon play as Peter's few friends which are both uniquely as nerdy and socially awkward as he is and allows for some of the films consistent laughs. I think one of the things that may shake audiences a bit is that the film does have slow periods pretty often, and while these moments don't really feel like the film dragging its feet, it doesn't really feel like it's moving fast enough either. Also the emotional impact, is just okay. It never feels flat or bad, but just not as impactful as it feels it should or need (which I notice more and more in the MCU).<br/><br/>Spider-Man Homecoming is more of what I wished the 2012 reboot was in getting straight to the point with the character and bringing fresh new energy. It is the strongest of Spidey solo films since Spider-Man 2, and hints that ""Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man"" won't be leaving town anytime soon."

","'Spider-Man: Homecoming' is a fun venture into the Marvel adaptation of the character, but it isn't without it's flaws. A few casting choices were baffling, and I don't feel that they delved enough into Peter's character, but this is certainly Spider-Man's best on-screen representation since 2004. With great action, a compelling villain, and the great balance between Peter Parker and Spider-Man, I definitely recommend 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' to Spider-Man fans and casual audiences."

","This version of Spider Man is a thousand times better than the two Andrew Garfield movies, but it still does not match the first two Tobey McQuire films.<br/><br/>The tie-ins with Iron Man and Captain America bring more life and comedy to the film and actually gives an average script more gusto. Had it not been for the tie-ins the movie would have been more of a TV special of the week type of film.<br/><br/>I like Tom Holland as Spider Man and I would say that had he been in the two Tobey McQuire films - he would have been the best Spider Man of all. Time will tell if the movies get better - because if they do it will be because of him.<br/><br/>Zendaya is awful. I mean downright dreadful. She is annoying in each and every scene that she is in and she is what made me take a 8 rating down to a 7 (and even thought 6) because she is so bad. And, of course, she adds to the false history of the building of the Washington Monument - which that false garbage needs to stay out of films.<br/><br/>Entertaining - well worth seeing.

They contain content appealing to general public as well as critique, but are not for people of my type. Speaking about this movie, amongst all the trailers and movie I liked the first trailer the most, it conveyed teen love and had beautiful music from song MGMT - Time to Pretend .<br/><br/>Acting was above average, although at the place where I saw, lacked subtitles. I wished if those were there. <br/><br/>The spiderman suit logic was good. It made sense of having such a suit which was not sewn but gifted (better logic as compared to previous movies).<br/><br/>Music was average. To - many people, the music might be good, but to me, I come from a land rich in that area (music). And thus music in my view, in the movie was average.

","I've been a huge fan of Spiderman since I was a child. Grew up collecting all the comics and I have seen all the movies/cartoons. I have supported the reboots but it's now getting ridiculous.<br/><br/>This film is nothing but PC advertisement. I enjoyed spiderman in Civil War but this film is a mess. Many scenes just seemed to be piece-mealed together for no reason. Majority of the movie doesn't even take place in Spiderman's home town! Majority of the characters just seem out of place. First there is Flash. He's pretty much a nerd who bullies Peter by calling him names like ""penis parker."" If you found that funny then you will probably like the movie. He gives off nothing ""threating"" unlike in the comics or other movies/cartoons where he's the stereotypical dumb football jock. I don't see how Flash isn't being bullied himself! They also just randomly made him Indian for no reason at all. Was that really necessary? In fact, all the characters are totally different than their comic counterparts other than the name. You'd think Hollywood would have learned their lesson by now but it seems some people just don't pay attention.<br/><br/>Then we have MJ the emo black girl (why they made her black see above). She basically just shows up at random places saying the most ridiculous things. ""I'm here because I have no friends."" You'd think the chick is on suicide watch.<br/><br/>Next, we have Peter's friend. I forget his name. He looks Filipino or something similar and again with the PC correctness. He also is another nerd, fat, and is into things like Star Wars. All the stereotypical nerd activities. He finds out Peter's identity right away because Peter has no spider-sense.<br/><br/>Tony Stark stole the show whenever he came onto the scene. As much as I like Tony Stark as Iron Man, having him replace the good old Uncle Ben is a travesty. Ben has already died in this movie but Peter hasn't really learned anything about power and responsibility since. It's like they replaced Uncle Ben with Tony as the role model. Ewwww.<br/><br/>The suit. Why oh why did they give spiderman a mecha suit? It even has AI which talks to spiderman as if he were Iron Man Jr. It will even automate most of his movies which just throws out the whole ""Hey let me rely on my acrobatic skill and spider-sense."" The suit contains a variety of weapons from stun blasts to nets to capture villains but it functions no different than Iron Man's own suit! Eventually near the end, he returns to the old ugly suit but then again, it's the end of the movie blah.<br/><br/>Besides Tony, Michael Keaton does a great job as the Vulture. You can understand why he turned to a life a crime with the way small businesses are getting the short end of the stick when major corporations move into town and take over all the business.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, this is just a mediocre spiderman movie."
"TxMike","Null","3","11","12 November 2017"," Yet another take on the Spider Man story, just a bit too manic for my tastes.
","My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library. <br/><br/>I read Spider Man comics growing up and really enjoyed the Toby Maguire version in 2002, the origin story was treated well and to me Maguire was the ideal actor to play Peter Parker and Spider Man.<br/><br/>This reincarnation uses British actor Tom Holland in the lead role. He is fine, his American accent is very good, sounding much like Michael J Fox in the BTTF movies. He is suitably small and young-looking to play a high school teenager. As this story starts he has had some experience with the Avengers and wants more. Tony Stark (Downey Jr.) is his mentor.<br/><br/>What I don't like is how Peter is cast as an often silly kid who always seems to be in some mess or the other. And when the action scenes are on they are very manic, to the point where the special effects become primary, the story secondary. Plus the several prior movies have better actors creating more interesting characters. <br/><br/>Still, we were entertained, but you can't help comparing them to the ones that came before and when I do, this one doesn't measure up."
"akwsixers10","9","3","11","16 September 2017"," Arguably Marvel's best yet, a fun, hilarious, colorful feature that delivers the years best twist
","I didn't think I would come out of the theater from Homecoming with the thought in my mind that this movie features the most effective plot twist of any movie this year. I certainly won't spoil it because it makes the movie and is so perfectly done that it was enough to bump this movie up to a 10/10. Tom Holland does amazing work as Peter Parker/Spiderman and is most certainly the most believable and effective actor to portray the actor on the big screen to date. We knew he was good from Civil War but a standalone feature of his own really allows him to embody the geeky and reckless side of the character. This Spiderman isn't very good at his job initially, but develops into an effective Avenger with the hilarious guidance of Tony Stark/Iron Man. Michael Giachinno's score is excellent as always and the action sequences are your typical web-slinger fair. Michael Keaton is probably the stand-out newcomer in the movie who delivers the most effective portrayal of a comic villain since Heath Ledger's legendary performance as joker, seriously, Keaton is that good. I could not recommend this movie enough to anyone looking for a good time at the theater and eagerly await Holland's return to the character in the upcoming Avengers: Infinity War."
"williampsamuel","9","2","6","21 March 2019"," The Best Spider Man Yet
","They say the remake is never as good as the original. And usually they're right, especially when a franchise is being rebooted for the second time in fifteen years. But Spider-Man Homecoming is the exception. It's not just as good as the 2002 Spider-Man, it's the best Spider-Man yet.<br/><br/>Thankfully Homecoming doesn't try to cover Spider-Man's origins yet again. There's no spider bite, no burglar, no Uncle Ben; that's all in the past. Instead of retreading the same old ground, we see a semi-experienced Spider-Man transition from battling neighborhood crime to fighting supervillains while struggling to get the recognition he thinks he deserves. And instead of another Hero's Journey story, we get a superhero film crossed with a teen comedy, complete with the bullying jock, geeky best friend, unobtainable crush, and a sarcastic, antisocial loner girl who appears just long enough to deliver cynical one liners.<br/><br/>Homecoming also benefits from an excellent cast. I still consider Toby Maguire to be the best Spider-Man, and Andrew Garfield did very well with the role too. But Tom Holland manages to take the role in a new, and much funnier direction. His version of Peter is younger, more awkward, more immature, and definitely more error prone. When he tries to web swing through the suburbs he has more wipeouts than George of the Jungle. His attempt to grill a suspect for information is hilariously pathetic. I hesitate to call a superhero movie realistic, but this version is much closer to what would happen if you actually gave a fifteen year old super powers.<br/><br/>For his part, Robert Downey Jr. continues to bring the awesomeness as Tony Stark, even if he doesn't have as much screen time as the trailers would suggest. And Michael Keaton makes a very good Vulture. He's surprisingly down to earth for a supervillain, and almost sympathetic until he starts threatening people's families. The decision to revamp the character from an elderly con artist to a high tech arms dealer gives him a more modern feel and I especially liked the redesign of his flight suit, halfway between the comic book design and an Iron Man foe.<br/><br/>The film also benefits hugely from being connected to the rest of Marvel's cinematic universe. Besides Iron Man's presence, the best part is we get to see what it's like to live and grow up in a world full of super humans. At the very beginning we're shown the cleanup that happens after a big superhero battle. We learn that yes, high schoolers do crush on superheroes and claim to know them to look cool. And yes, even Captain America gets stuck doing cheesy PSAs and educational shorts.<br/><br/>Somewhat surprisingly, the old line about great power coming with great responsibility is never uttered once. But that lesson still permeates the story. Before it meant not walking away from the good fight because it got in the way of your life. This time it means learning your limits, asking for help, and not putting innocent bystanders in danger. Which Peter does again and again because he's rebellious, extremely cocky, and determined to show Iron-Man that he can do anything, with or without his help. He's got heart and commitment, but maturity and judgement are still a work in progress.<br/><br/>Spider-Man Homecoming delivers an excellent blend of action and comedy, a delightfully energetic and lighthearted tone, and lots of interesting, well rounded characters. My only real complaint is that at some points during the final fight it's hard to see what's happening between the smoke, darkness, and flashing lights, but overall the action scenes are as entertaining as the rest of the movie. Director John Watts has breathed new life into familiar material and taken the franchise in highly promising new directions. Here's to the inevitable sequel."

I found it to be mediocre at best, with long stretches of very boring dialogue and no action. What really ruined it, though, is the ever present insufferable politically correct quips thrown in. There is absolutely no evidence that the Washington Monument was built by slaves or that slaves even participated in its construction. The contractors that were used to build the monument did not use slaves, and non of the records indicate that they used slaves. But the myth is perpetuated by this movie. It's just disheartening that political correctness has to be injected into the movie when it is not relevant to the plot--it merely serves to ruin the movie."
"carologletree","8","2","6","8 January 2018"," A Return to Form for Spidey
","This was a surprisingly good addition to the Spider-Man mythos. The third on-screen iteration of Spider-Man, the sixth Spider-Man movie, and the first time Spider-Man is a part of the MCU (aside from his involvement in ""Captain America: Civil War""), this film brought some really neat stuff to the table.<br/><br/>Tom Holland is a great Peter Parker/Spider-Man. He is much more suited to be Peter Parker than Andrew Garfield, who was too much of a jock. Like Tobey Maguire, Holland really brings a relatable vulnerability to Peter Parker, and he really seemed to be having fun as Spider-Man. I thought that the new things they did with the Spidey suit were really cool and interesting.<br/><br/>Michael Keaton as The Vulture proved to be an excellent villain. He's a much better villain than any of the baddies from the two ""Amazing Spider-Man"" films. He's a fairly compelling character, and Keaton managed to make him very convincing.<br/><br/>The action sequences are very well done. I particularly liked the sequence where Spider-Man had to stop the elevator from crashing and the ferry scene.<br/><br/>It also has a solid supporting cast. Robert Downey Jr. is fantastic as Tony Stark/Iron Man as usual, Aunt May was good, and I also really enjoyed Peter's best friend Ned.<br/><br/>The film does have some issues, though. The pacing at times can feel very off, and I didn't find Liz, Peter's crush, to be that interesting of a character. There are also some instances where the humor falls a bit flat.<br/><br/>However, I still really enjoyed this movie overall. This is a solid addition to the MCU, and I can definitely say that it's the best Spider-Man movie since Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man 2.""<br/><br/>RATING: B+"
"adamsmith-51004","6","2","6","20 October 2017"," Possibly the weakest Spider-Man film
","First of all let me start off by saying that I am a huge fan of Spider-Man and that he is one of the best comic book superheroes. After the very poor The Amazing Spider-Man 2 I suppose it made sense to give Spider-Man a reboot. I like many were excited by the prospect of Marvel being involved. Went to see this film with my brothers and after hearing only positive reviews went in confident of the fun being good. The film has some good points Tom Holland is very good as Peter Parker and Spider-Man and is very much like his personality from the comics. However, I can't say much more about the film positively. Spider-Man is and has nearly always worked alone so don't see the reason for iron man making him effectively his b****. According to this film iron man designed the famous suit. He also tells Spider-Man what he can and cannot do. Instead of Spider-Man being a hero finding his way it came across as him being stupid. In many of the scenes he messes up and te fight with vulture who once again in movie form we have to have a mechanical suit he ends up defeating himself. Also the amount of people in this movie that find out he is Spider-Man is ridiculous, first his best friend and then right at the end the very poorly cast aunt may. For anyone of my age who loved the original Spider-Man trilogy then this is way below."
"nassanwar","5","2","6","19 August 2017"," Funny... but not Great
","Spider-Man is finally back in the hands of Marvel studios and is now part of the MCU, but is that really a good thing? The Marvel Machine is back with a new superhero flick, Spider-Man: Homecoming the introduction of the beloved hero into this huge franchise already chock full of different kinds of heroes, villains, and characters. But can the character still be as great in a universe where everyone has the same character traits we've known and loved about him? For example, His joking cracking at tense moments, his nerdy and antisocial nature, or his ability to be heroic while still being relatable to the average moviegoer. This was the big question I had going into the film, and I don't think I got the answer I wanted.<br/><br/>My biggest problem with the MCU movies is the lack of a strong villain presence in the movies. All the villains they've introduced, besides Loki, have been throwaway characters with almost no real motivation that the protagonist will defeat and kill by the end of the very same movie they are introduced in. They always seem to treat their villains as a means-to-an-end as opposed to an end themselves, they use the villain not as a character of the story but as a plot device that moves the plot forward. This leads to suspense-less and boring action sequences where we don't care about what's happening. In Spider-Man: Homecoming the main villain, Vulture, is for the most part better than most (Maybe best behind Loki) but still lacks a lot in development to really call him a great villain in terms of all movie villains. Michael Keaton might be what makes the character as great as he is, his performance gives mixed sense of comfort and fear that leaves you tense in your seat waiting to see what he does next. If most other actors had played the role the flaws would be much more prevalent. His motivation for his actions is weak and clich√©, the writers took no real time to flesh out why he does what he does, just gave him a cookie-cutter type background and moved along with the story. But give credit where it's due, Keaton delivers a villain that can bring suspense to the film's narrative, unlike some of the recent MCU installments (Kurt Russell as Ego in GOTG2).<br/><br/>Speaking of cookie-cutter plot points, Marvel seems to really like the idea of reusing character traits and personalities, we see it in the similarities in Tony Stark and Steven Strange in terms of the arrogance and character arc from it. This time they decided to make Spider-Man's suit basically a slimmer, more agile Iron Man suit all the way down to the personal assistant voice. And I understand that Tony Stark is the one who makes the suit but we've already seen the movie where the hero has to learn to use a technologically advanced suit he's not used to, it was Iron Man (2008). A lot of the plot and visual cues throughout the film seemed to have come straight from that film and reformatted to fit with a high school drama superhero film. While a lot of the sequences and scenes were cool to see, it gets tiring to pay to see the same movie year after year with almost no originality or innovation.<br/><br/>Speaking of the suit, the thing that bothered me the most is the lack of explanation for what Spider-Man's powers are without it. They make it seem as though anyone can wear the suit and be Spider-Man and that takes away most of the interest you'd have for Peter Parker. When this movie was announced, people were clamoring that they don't make another origin story, that we've already seen it twice we didn't need it again. I wholeheartedly disagree with that sentiment because while we've seen the other Spider- Man origin stories this is a new and different character from those that we need to learn about his beginnings to begin to care about him as a character. Without that origin information we have no clue who Peter Parker is, and what are the limits to his powers nor what they are.<br/><br/>The biggest thing I appreciated from this movie is the lack of a world-ending threat to end the movie, which Marvel seems to believe, is the only way to end their movies now. Instead they realize that there can still be tension and excitement in a simple, one location crime scene where the villain isn't trying to destroy the world.<br/><br/>While this film does do a better job at developing its villain than most of the other Marvel films, it doesn't take the proper time to develop any of the other characters, especially the titular character. There is a moment at the end of the film where Peter Parker does something that comes out of nowhere and is a characteristic of his character that is never shown throughout the film. The movie relies on you knowing a lot of background information on the character to understand this decision. This along with the feeling of not knowing enough about the characters leaves a lot to be desired.<br/><br/>Overall, Spider-Man: Homecoming is an improvement over the recent slump of films that have come out of the MCU. It truly does feel like a classic high school movie, like the films of John Hughes. The cinematography and color pallet of the film are far superior than any of the other Marvel movies which seem to put little effort into making a shot that looks good on screen. But in this film the colors really pop beautifully on screen and enhance the overall experience. In the end this film probably meets the same fate as the other MCU films, it was a fun time and experience to watch in the theater but it provides nothing insightful or interesting to make me want to see it again later."
"said-buet10","7","2","6","7 August 2017"," This movie had done a lot of right things
","Another reboot which involved MARVEL Studios was bound to be good. This didn't fail to live up to that expectation. This movie is a completely new take on the web-slinging superhero. The masked vigilante for the first time at his teens. And it didn't screw up this incarnation of spider-man rather it gave a new perspective of a young superhero growing up in a post avengers era.<br/><br/>Tom Holland as a young spider-man seemed pretty solid to me. His acting was good. Michael Keaton on the other hand was very good. We expect nothing less from him. I think vulture as a villain felt more personal in this movie than all of the villains of Amazing spider-man movies, it was close to the green goblin of original spider-man. The car scene was mind-blowing, you will know if you have seen the movie.<br/><br/>The story was good but I had some issues with it. I LOVE Tony Stark but I felt his inclusion at this amount in this movie was unnecessary. They could've let spidey evolve himself. The suit felt like another iron-ma suit. It was a good tool but spider-man has been more than capable of doing things himself without those assistance before and even in the third act of this movie. They could've dropped it in the end.<br/><br/>Long story short, I like this adaptation. It is good enough and I can't wait to see the sequel."
"justinwfirestone","7","2","6","7 August 2017"," Fun and no Uncle Ben
","Finally, we get a new actor playing Spider-Man who doesn't have to watch Uncle Ben die. Don't get me wrong, I love watching Uncle Ben get murdered as much as the next movie-goer, but we all have to admit those Uncle Ben deaths were starting to weigh heavy on our minds, much unlike Spider-Man's webs, which are light yet strong.<br/><br/>We finally get an answer to the question that's nagged me the most about Spider-Man: how does he get around when there are no buildings nearby to shoot his webs onto and swing from? Spider-Man surely would be at a disadvantage on an open battlefield, or even a regular field.<br/><br/>We also now know where Spider-Man keeps his extra web juice, and I have to admit my ignorance here because I thought, you know, as Spider-Man, he generated his own web juice, or at least knew a guy who could make it on the cheap. Then again, after a long day of shooting your web juice all over town, it makes sense that you'd run out eventually, the law of conservation of matter being applicable to the Marvel Universe and what not.<br/><br/>Spider-Man is 15 and struggles with fun teen times such as social awkwardness, curfews, dating, identity issues, and the desire to make a meaningful contribution to society. The villain is a hardened, simple man trying to make ends meet for his family and employees, with a bit of maudlin jealousy towards Peter Parker, possibly pining for a simpler time when your whole life is ahead of you, and aliens weren't trying to destroy the earth, galaxy, or universe.<br/><br/>Why is Tony Stark in this movie? He doesn't trust Peter Parker with any real responsibility, and does little to tingle one's Spidey senses. Perhaps this is a parallel for Marvel Studios not trusting Tom Holland to carry a movie by himself, even though he likely would have done just fine without the extra star power. He convincingly plays a teenage dork who thinks it's really cool to be Spider-man, despite the perpetual threat of death or severe beatings.<br/><br/>Despite the perpetual threat of Spider-Man movies."

The better the story lines the better the movie. Here, Peter Parker is kind of a clich√É¬© as a teenager. Still, he is fun and a bit dense. If I have an issue, it is his over confidence at times. For one with his gifts he can be quite naive. We have numerous moments when everything could explode but he manages to escape detection. I have to say that I'm growing tired of the physical confrontations, the violent fights. When two foes can't seem to harm each other no matter what they do, it actually gets a little dull. Still, I think this film bodes well for the future. One of the better. Oh, Michael Keaton lights up the screen."

Meanwhile we have Zendaya playing Michelle, a curious sort of teen girl who is obvious curious about Peter Parker, even taller than Liz, yet manages to contain herself because Peter ignores her most of the time, spending all his attention on Liz. Then to add to the confusion we have Karen, the seductive voice of Spidey's suit, a seeming siren trying to appeal to his emotions (voiced by Jennifer Connelly).<br/><br/>While this film gets off on a major tangent with the Stark Internship and a couple of clever sequences with the Washington Monument and Staten Island Ferry, plus a little action near Coney Island, it does focus more on teen coming of age than any previous film version.<br/><br/>Michael Keaton's Adrian Toomes / Vulture is a pretty evil bad guy, with lots of help. It is he who accidentally retools the film late by forcing Spidey to prove he is more than Stark's suit and he makes Parker save everybody without it. While this one has a pretty decent soundtrack, the music is more background here than in Marvel's Guardians of The Galaxy 2 last month.<br/><br/>Strange the way this script has so many people finding out that Pater Parker is Spiderman. this could be a very messy one to sequel. That makes sense to me as the trailers I saw at this movie were sequels to movie series I have never seen the first ones too. Maybe the new trend in movies is to re-make box office bombs until they get it right.<br/><br/>What this movie gets right is the entertainment, special effects, and ultimate inspiration to give the viewers what they want, particularly the younger ones. Those who care about script will not like this mess of a script. This one is long on entertainment but does come of age for Parker late in the film as Liz moves away after Parker puts her father away for bad behavior. As if there is not enough people who know that Parker is Spiderman including Aunt May and one of his talkative high school friends, spoiler - Liz's Dad knows too. It is going to be curious how the sequel of this will work, or not."

","Tom Holland does justice to the Peter Parker character. I didn't miss Tobey Maguire even once. All the character were good. Michael Keaton character is the one the viewers should look out for. he acted as the perfect villain for the role. The only thing which it lack was some different story-line from the usual ones. Over all it was entertaining funny with lots of action in second half. I expect Stan lee to come up with super heroes stories with suspense in the story line."
"burlesonjesse5","7","2","6","9 July 2017"," VIEWS ON FILM review of Spider-Man: Homecoming
","Peter Parker wants to be part of the Avengers. And under the eyeing supervision of Tony Stark, he may get his chance assuming the identity of Spider-Man, the web-shooting NYC victor. That's the gist of Spider-Man: Homecoming, my latest review.<br/><br/>Looking like a cross between a young Tony Goldwyn and a teenage Eric Bana, Tom Holland plays Mr. Parker. He's decent in the role but there's a certain amount of guilelessness in his performance. When Pete defeats a bad guy, he spouts off stuff like ""yippee"" or ""woohoo"". It feels a little grating at times but hey, the dude portrays an undeveloped fifteen-year-old so I guess it's you know, predicted.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm not an aficionado on superhero films nor am I a fanatic when it comes the character of Spider-Man (or the Spider-Man franchise). I did however, enjoy Spider-Man: Homecoming. It's a sort of ""you can tell"" way of rebooting the yesteryear of Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield.<br/><br/>Now I was hesitant on taking in a screening seeing that ""Homecoming's"" trailer readily misleads you. I initially thought of something low budget, with a kiddie feel, a cartooning palate, and yet another change in the lead actor department. Heck, for all I know this could've been the next Home Alone 3. Thankfully that wasn't the case.<br/><br/>Lushly directed by Colorado native Jon Watts, Spider-Man: Homecoming allows Johnny boy to generate stupendous action sequences at breakneck speed. His camera, which gives the film a more comic book look see, is always hastily roving around. My favorite sequence is one in which Spider-Man saves his buddies from an elevator crash via the Washington Monument. It's pretty invigorating stuff and if you're afraid of heights, you might have to look away.<br/><br/>All in all, ""Homecoming's"" budget is still healthy at $175 million. It's $118 million below the last Spidey-sense installment (2014's The Amazing Spider-Man 2) but so what. The vibe with Spider- Man Homecoming is less dark, more fancy-free, more cheery, and more whimsy than anything else in the Spider-Man canon. It's like superhero fanaticism meets Pretty in Pink or She's All That. Add a creepy malefactor in Michael Keaton (he plays Adrian Toomes aka Vulture) and the result is a stony mixture of cutesy high schooling, deadpan humor, and intimidating villainy. What can I say, it just works. Rating: 3 stars."
"brankovranjkovic","7","2","6","9 July 2017"," Spider-man Homecoming: The Best Spider-man Film So Far
","An action film with some comedy scenes. Even though there's another new actor taking the helm, this is thankfully NOT another origin story.<br/><br/>Stars Tom Holland, who is playing by far the best wise-cracking Spider-man to date, his age is more aligned to the comic-book character. His age also makes another 2 or 3 further films possible. Michael Keaton is the 'Vulture'(the villain) but one with some sympathy and an enormous twist. The love interest is a little clich√É¬©, but I guess we can't really avoid this central character! The 'man in the chair' is a very funny character and really needs further development in subsequent films. Tony Stark (the mentor) provides a highly technical Spider suit with a heads-up display just like Iron-man's, he installs a 'training wheels protocol' while Spider-man gets to grips with what it can do.<br/><br/>It's obvious that Spider-man is still a youngster and still learning how to be a hero, but the plot is his ambition is to be part of The Avengers.<br/><br/>Spider-man proves himself worthy to be an Avenger by the end. Stay in your seat as there's the usual post credit scenes."

","The best Spider Man movie since Spider Man 2. Spider Man Homecoming has everything that a Spider Man movie should have he's a kid whose in high school dealing with problems but also being a superhero which is Spider Man and the way how Tom Holland portrayed Peter Parker & Spider Man which was awesome he really played the character well like how any normal kid would play dealing with problems in real life trying to balance everything at once. Michael Keaton as Vulture was good his character was good and a lot of depth in it his the chemistry between Spider Man & Vulture was good especially the fight scenes were awesome too. Robert Downey Jr. was good as well he was a mentor in this movie helping Peter in every way to help him become a superhero. Other characters in the movie were not bad especially Zendaya's character I felt that her character was a little out of the picture meaning I felt that she had no purpose in the movie she was just a regular school kid. Marisa Tomei as Aunt May was good too and to top of all that I highly recommend seeing this movie if you're a Spider Man fan because I am for one going to see this movie again I give this movie a 8/10"
"PyroSikTh","8","2","6","8 July 2017"," Definitely my Favourite Spider-Man movie
","Homecoming was definitely worth it, even if only as another chapter in the sprawling MCU epic. Homecoming skips Peter's origin entirely, which is fine because we maybe don't need to see it again. Instead the film opens in the fallout of the Battle of New York in Avengers, where a privately contracted clean-up crew are replaced by a government-sanctioned team. Embittered and feeling victimised, Adrian Toomes and his crew decide to keep some of the alien tech they salvaged and use it to create powerful weapons to sell on the black market. Not only did they put Spider-Man in the MCU, but they tied his first solo adventure directly into the tapestry of the MCU. It managed to develop a part of this universe we don't really get to see outside of the TV shows; the effect of all these superheroes on your everyday civilian. Peter and his friends literally grew up in a world of superheroes, which as an adult I'm finding hard to quantify (I was already out of school when the MCU even started).<br/><br/>If Doctor Strange was a superhero movie revolving around magic and fantasy, Logan was a superhero movie bathed in the light of Westerns, and Guardians of the Galaxy was a superhero movie supplanted into a Space Opera, then Homecoming is a superhero in the world of a John Hughes movie. Or at least that's quite evidently what they were aiming for. Peter Parker is just one in a group of high school teenagers involved in the Academic Decathlon. There's the rich, attractive senior Liz, the moody loner Michelle, the aggressive and vulgar bully Flash, the overweight nerdy kid Ned, and a couple of others too.<br/><br/>Some smaller points of contention I have include the music and the action sequences. The action sequences were often too dark and just a blur of indiscernible action. It's hard to tell what's even happening in the movie's grand climax at the end, and not just because it's night time on a stealth plane with debris flying everywhere, and it's not even the only action sequence to suffer from this either.<br/><br/>The music as well gets exactly the same criticism that I've given pretty much every other Marvel movie. Come on Marvel, you've been doing this nearly ten years, and this has been a criticism since the very beginning. You need to put more focus on your movies soundtracks! What's worse, this is Spider-Man, he already has his own iconic theme already written and ready to go. We get a sweet orchestral version over the Marvel Studios logo, and that's it. It never appears again. Michael Giacchino has done some good work before, but his work on both this and Doctor Strange has been about as vanilla and forgettable as a soundtrack can get.<br/><br/>Tom Holland is hands down the best Peter Parker we've ever had though. He manages to balance the nerdy awkwardness of Tobey Maguire's version with the witty, charismatic turn of Andrew Garfield, giving us the best of both worlds. He manages to be extremely likable even at his most whiny and hormonal, which is absolutely a hard task to fulfil. He also manages to inject some real emotion behind it all as well. Him being crushed under the weight of concrete hits hard because he appears like a kid scared and alone, finally realising how out of depth he really is.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast are really good too. Michael Keaton's turn as Adrian Toomes is really well developed and performed, making him one of the better villains in the MCU so far (this year looks to be a promising year for MCU villains). Robert Downey Jr. is...well at this point there isn't any point in talking about his Tony Stark performances any more. What I did like was he was used much more sparingly than the marketing would have you believe. He makes about three appearances grand total, each one brief but effective. Marisa Tomei gives us possibly the best Aunt May we've had, although like Peter's friends she suffers from a distinct lack of screen time. Her casting was a little controversial, but I always thought the traditional depiction of Aunt May was a little weird, I mean, she's his aunt, not his grandmother. <br/><br/>The humour of Homecoming was also a big yes. Marvel has definitely doubled down on the more colourful and light-hearted side of superheroes, and Homecoming continues that trend naturally and effortlessly. It's a very funny movie from one-liners to visual cues, to small references. And yet none of it feels shoehorned in (like it did with Doctor Strange). Spider-Man having to run across a field because there's no buildings to swing from was a stroke of genius in the comedic department, and although Ned suffers from a lack of character development, he serves as a great source of comic relief throughout.<br/><br/>Spider-Man: Homecoming is easily my favourite Spider-Man movie so far. I was never a huge fanboy of the Raimi trilogy, and while Amazing Spider-Man was great, it didn't feel typically like a Spider-Man movie (and the less said about it's sequel the better). Homecoming manages to be fun and entertaining, while weaving Spider-Man into the very tapestry of the MCU. It's story is engaging throughout, and Adrian Toomes poses as one of the most compelling villains of the MCU so far (which I realise isn't really saying much). Holland is simply perfect. I give Homecoming a solid and comfortable 8/10."
"scott-sw","7","2","6","7 July 2017"," Spider-Man Swings Back to the Top
","Spider-Man Homecoming is appropriately named, finally bringing our favorite web-slinger home to fun, lighthearted fun. After the Raimi- Maguire era came to an ignoble stop, and after Garfield's gloomy, glum, grim take bottomed it out, Spidey is swinging strong. This is the best since the apex of Raimi's Spider-Man 2 over a decade ago. We begin immediately after the Avengers defeat of the Chitari in New York when Adrian Toomes (Michael Keaton) is scavenging through the alien technology. He was contracted to do so, but then ingloriously kicked to the curb by the government and Tony Stark/Ironman (Robert Downey, Jr.) He takes some for himself to research and use. Kick forward to near present day when Peter Parker/Spider-Man (Tom Holland) helps the Stark Team against the Cap Team in Civil War. Then, we return to New York where Stark tells Spider-Man he will be an asset to the Avenger and to wait for his call. Spidey is now relegated to the kids table while Happy Hogan (Jon Faverau) ""monitors"" his progress. The adults tend to ignore Peter Parker as he gives minor help and juggles his life at high school. He still wants to prove himself, and eventually stumbles across Toomes' team as they try to sell weapons fueled by alien technology, and rob from ATMs. Happy and Tony tell Spidey to stay out of the big stuff, but not much else. Spidey is desperate to prove he is ready and pursues the low-lying crime syndicate on his own. He does a few impressive things, but eventually, his endeavors backfire. Tony Stark/Ironman has to bail him out, and takes the suit. Alone, Spidey has to figure out how to save the day. There are a few gripes to get out of the way. First is the Spider-Man suit from Stark can do as much as the Ironman suit. This takes away from Peter's ingenuity and creativity he displays in the comics. Secondly, the Aunt May character is underused, undeveloped, and miscast. And this seems to be a conscious decision by writers and producers to focus on the Peter Parker cadre at school. Aunt May is a prominent character, and can show all of strength as Rosemary Harris proved in Spider-Man 2. Finally, the lacking of adults in the movie spreads to the crew as well. With the focus on high school, mostly Peter's peers, it is a high school movie. Of course, Peter is in high school, and attempting to reconcile his aspirations for peers and his responsibility. On the other hand, the strengths of homecoming outpace this missteps. The first kudos is to Tom Holland who portrays the web-slinger with such conflict, hope, and frustration so well. Between his anger with Happy and Tony, and reconciling his disappearances with Aunt May and his friends, and trying to impress the Avengers, Holland gives us an earnest performance. The audience will believe he is 16. Just as good is Michael Keaton as Adrian Toomes. As a Spider-Man comic collector, I never held the Vulture is high regard. That goes the opposite way in this cinematic adaptation. This was the best villain since Doc Ock in Spider-Man 2. He does garner sympathy to a certain extent, but Keaton gives the Toomes character the right amount of bitterness, anger, and desperation. Finally, there is a Spider-Man who has to reckon with being a kid and wanting to be an adult with adult figures failing him. As a kid, he makes mistakes because he does not stop to think things through. This is Spider-Man movie of the future. It works, and works well. It still does not have the power and gravitas of the original Raimi/Maguire movies (1-2), but it is a great one for the ages."
"its_always_sunny_in_dublin","8","2","6","7 July 2017"," 'Adds some much needed heart to the MCU'
","First of all, this is not the 3rd reboot in 15 years, so don't let that put you off. You're brought into the story after the conventional character turning point of how they got their powers and the tragedy that causes them to don a suit and fight crime that you normally get in a first solo outing.<br/><br/>The movie adds some much needed heart to the MCU at a time where we're seeing the entries in the Marvel franchise move toward a serious tone that's looming over this universe in preparation for the upcoming Infinity Wars movies. <br/><br/>It's very much a comedy based superhero movie and is loaded with some very good jokes. The one overall feeling that stood out for me was that it felt like Deadpool with a 12 or PG rating, and that is not a bad thing. There's a great comedic feel throughout, and is present right through to the SECOND aftercredits scene.<br/><br/>Marvel seems to have a knack for casting the right people in their movies, and have continued to do so with Tom Holland and Michael Keaton. Holland is perfect in his portrayal of teenager who has been given superpowers and captures the duel persona of a high school student and superhero perfectly. The struggles he goes through and the the way he acts them out seem realistic, natural and believable. He's strong in both scenes where he is on his own and when interacting with others, in particular his confidant Ned (Jacob Batalon), who also has some brilliant comedic moments of his own.<br/><br/>I think it's also worth mentioning that we get to see some focus on a character who has been in the MCU since 2008, not Iron Man, but Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau). In this we begin to see him acting as more than a bodyguard for Tony Stark and somewhat stepping out of his shadow to be an additional supportive role for Peter Parker, albeit with some apprehension and reluctance.<br/><br/>It's a film that also loaded with a fair few Easter Eggs and nods to some inspirational material (the John Hughes inspired sequence was definitely one of my favourites and not that hard to miss), so fans of the Marvel franchise will have a lot ""ahhhh!"" moments. <br/><br/>Overall I enjoyed it, but there were some things that were obvious and fell into the traditional 'superhero movie moments' which you may see coming. I also can't get over one particular shot with the 'Audi AI Drive' which was clearly just inserted as a product placement moment to keep Audi happy.<br/><br/>Even if you're not a particular fan of Spiderman, but enjoy the Marvel movies, you should enjoy this, and if you're a Spiderman fan you should really enjoy it."
"FlashCallahan","7","2","6","7 July 2017"," Marvel does John Hughes..........
","High-school superhero Peter Parker aspires to join the Avengers in his guise as Spider- Man<br/><br/>But during his 'internship', teenage woes and Tony Stark's contradictory mentorship only complicate his ambitions.........<br/><br/>Even though the title is quite the chin stroking one, this obviously refers to one of Marvels most famous characters returning to where he belongs, but with Sony and Columbia having ever such a small finger in this heroic pie......<br/><br/>.......and at times it shows.<br/><br/>Homecoming does entertain, Holland is wonderful as our favourite web slinger, and as you would expect, Keaton is wonderful as the antagonist, and just as Nicholson did to him in 1989, he steals the film from Holland.<br/><br/>It has all the elements you'd expect from the MCU, endless references to the universe, some really funny moments, most of them courtesy of Ned. Again, family, both nuclear and metaphorical are an important factor to the narrative, especially in one quite amazing plot twist, but I couldn't help but feel that something was missing.<br/><br/>For some reason, the class system is an important part of the narrative, We have Keaton explain it a little in the third act, his Vulture could almost be an evil Robin Hood, as he explains that it's the working class who suffer and people like Tony Stark reap the benefits from events like the final battle in The Avengers, which is quite an interesting element, but it never really gets focused on too much, which is a shame.<br/><br/>Culture and ethnicity plays a really important part of the narrative also, and this makes one certain twist in the film all the. More surprising.<br/><br/>Supporting cast are wonderful, but sorely underused. Tomei and Holland have great chemistry as Aunt and Nephew, but it needed to be focused on a little more, because there are times when their relationship feels a little 'Last Action Hero'. But Tomei does get the biggest laugh in the film, and you will understand why the BBFC classification includes the warning of 'obscured bad language'.<br/><br/>Some of the references are spoon fed to the audience, one particular scene where our hero is running through gardens to get somewhere references 'Ferris Bueller', which would have been funny if the makers didn't I literally have a garden where a group of people are watching said film.<br/><br/>Downey Jr. pops up every now and again to wind Spider-mans neck in, and he's as brilliant as expected, even though he's looking a little Al Pacino in this.<br/><br/>Favreau is also quite charming as Happy, and again, there is one scene where it appears he is finally warming to Parker, that gets a really funny punchline.<br/><br/>So all in all it's a film that doesn't just focus on teen angst and rebellion, it focuses on the class system, ethnicity, family matters, and and of course, great power and great responsibility, even though those words are never really uttered, thank heavens.<br/><br/>But something is missing, this could have been something wonderful, but Marvel don't really go as leftfield as they could have done. It feels like they knew that Spider-Man was a safe bet, so instead of being wonderful, it's just, good.<br/><br/>As always there is a post credits sequence, and it's the most pointless, but funniest one of all. It's almost mocking the audience."

"eden-rabatsch","8","2","6","6 July 2017"," Spider Boy - John Hughes meets comic book action
","Welcome home SpiderBoy! It is not often that a film that is a reboot of a reboot in a universe pumping out about three films a year somehow, improbably, fills you with movie joy. The difficulty level that Jon Watts faced as one of six writers and with a scant directing resume would have been enough to (and has) destroyed more seasoned professionals and yet the team has produced a film brimming with teen angst, recklessness, heroism √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú The Breakfast Club for superheroes. The film is set just after the Battle of New York where we see alien artifacts are being harvested and some for nefarious purposes. Jump ahead a few years and Peter Parker/Spiderman played by Tom Holland is extremely keen to prove himself and get on the Avengers team and out of high school. Soon he becomes aware of a villain called The Vulture, ironically played by The Birdman Michael Keaton, who has assembled a gang of high tech thieves. All this is played against the travails of detention, teen crushes and being caught half way between kid and adulthood. Let's start with Jon Watts. I am actually amazed that he got this gig. I have never seen a Jon Watts' film though I have had his horror film ""Clown"" on my list for a while now. Still five films and then a 175 million dollar blockbuster √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú that must have been some pitch! There were six or so writers which normally is a death knell for any film. Very hard for a film to have a consistent tone with that many voices but Spiderman HC does it. I suspect it is because we have two films being made √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú one, a by the letter superhero film and the other a teen comedy. The writers look like they stayed on their respective fields with Watts and Kevin Feige (the Marvel ringmaster) keeping it all on point. Watts deftly keeps all the balls in the air and has a career about to rocket after this achievement. Watts was helped greatly by some impressive casting. Remember, Tobey Maguire and Tom Holland are only a year apart but Maguire acted like he was 35 and Holland looks all of the 15 that his Peter Parker represents. Watts needs to buy the Russo brothers a drink for casting Holland in ""Captain America: Civil War"" as he lights up the screen as a totally credible teenager. He is just reckless enough, just heroic enough, shy but with ego √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú he really sells the role. Scene stealer Jacob Batalon as his best friend Ned gives great comic relief but also does a lot of heavy lifting in making the teen universe seem real. The rest of the cast are brilliant. I really mean this √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú nearly every small role has a great young actor or comedian. Matthew Starr as a teacher, Donald Glover as a small time crook (even funnier as Glover once lobbied to be Spidey), Bokeem Woodbine, Hannibal Burress even Jennifer Connelly as Karen, Spidey's Costume AI. Still it is a truism that holds that the true measure of a superhero film is the villain against which he battles. Michael Keaton plays Adrian Toomes aka The Vulture. This is an interesting portrayal because he is a post Trump villain. Whenever he does something evil he can justify it as being put down by the big guys. I suspect people would vote for him. His group of villains are also relatively small scale. He is more Tony Soprano then The Godfather. Keaton is having a great mid-career renaissance and he has that excellent range that allows him to pivot between scenes, he never becomes cartoonish. This is an agile movie which for the most part is played for small stakes. The fact that the viewer is as worried about The Vulture as whether Peter will get to the Homecoming dance says a lot about the skill at play here. The film does suffer from being one set piece too long. At 133 minutes it would have been better served at coming in 15 or so minutes shorter. These are quibbles in the end because I laughed and aahed all the way through it. The Washington Monument set piece is beautifully composed mixing CGI and practical effects for maximum fun. This film owes just as much to John Hughes as it does to Sam Raimi and for me that is a heavenly cocktail."
"JC_Ride","7","1","2","23 May 2020"," Refreshing, but not impressive take on the character!
","I honestly didn't have a lot of expectations for this movie, but it came out a bit better than I expected. Let's start with the positives that I think outweigh the negative.<br/><br/>Putting Peter on highscool and not showing his origin story is, in my opinion a great move. It's a story we've already seen twice, and if this movie was an origin story as well we would have seen 3 Spiderman origin stories within 15 years. That would be one Spiderman origin story every 5 years! Highscool is also a new place for movie Spidey (No that one Raimi scene with the 18 year olds than look like 38 year olds doesn't count) and thank god we didn't have to see ANOTHER Uncle Ben death scene. Tom Holland is great in this. Not sure if he's as god as Tobey but he encapsulates a young Peter very nicely! I also like how Peter's suit is handed to him by Stark, how am I supposed to believe that a 15 year old boy made a suit on his own. Plus said suit looks great. The humour is ok, nothing to bring you to tears but not annoying either. I also really like the plot. I love that for once Spidey has to stop something relatively small. He doesn't have to stop a reactor from swallowing the city or an alien species that takes over people. Just a gang with high tech weapons. And that's fine. Also the twist is very well executed! Speaking of it, Michael Keatons Vulture is a great villain with some of the most realistic motivation for turning evil that I've seen in a superhero movie. Lastly some scenes like the one where Spidey rescues his friends are very fun and all in all the movie is very enjoyable.<br/><br/>Now for the bad...<br/><br/>By far the biggest problem here is the action, that is the worst in any Spiderman film to date. The bank scene is short, the ferry fight is meh and the final fight is nice, but not too impressive. There are a few other minor ones that aren't even worth mentioning. Very disappointing action. Plus, not a huge fan of Aunt May here, and Flash is just kinda sad to watch. I also forgot Shocker was in the movie, but it doesn't matter as he's a minor villain in the comics anyways. By the way, yes the overeliance on tech is a bit annoying, yet it's great that in the final fight he only has his web shooters, proving he's Spiderman even without the suit (unlike a certain Black Panther). Lastly, there is a slightly excessive useof cgi at times. The movie doesn't have Black Panther level bad cgi, but it's not that great either.<br/><br/>Plot and villain elevate this movie, bit lackluster action prevents it from being great. 7/10."

","With the story of several superheroes having been established previously, one important member of the Avengers in the comics spoke, and certainly one of the most popular. Spider-Man was created by editor / writer Stan Lee and writer / artist Steve Ditko, and his first appearance was in the anthology book Amazing Fantasy # 15 (August 1962) and gained even more popularity with previous film adaptations, especially the trilogy directed by Sam Raimi.
Since their film rights are tied to Sony, only now have Sony and Disney made a deal for Spider-Man to appear in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Tom Holland made his debut as Spider-Man in the 2016 UCM film, Captain America: Civil War, before now starring in his own film, directed by Jon Watts, who had previously been featured with the interesting Clown (2014) and The Vehicle (2015), in addition to writing short films and television series. With this agreement, the subtitle of the feature ""Back to Home"" never made so much sense, referring to one of his stories in the comics and, also making this reference with the return of the character to his home, Marvel.
The most interesting thing about this script written by twelve hands by Jonathan Goldstein, John Francis Daley, Jon Watts, Christopher Ford, Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers, is how he manages to draw parallels and make all the connections with other Avengers films, even the insertion effective Spider-Man has occurred late, only in the final phase of phase 3 of the Marvel universe in theaters. Right off the bat, we've gone back eight years in the chronology of the universe, right after the battle of the newly revealed to the world, Avengers, against the alien race Chitauri in New York. Right away, we are already introduced to one of the best known villains in the comics, the Vulture / Adrian Toomes, played here by the always great Michale Keaton, who was once on the other side of the story, as Bruce Wayne, Batman.
Right away, we already know the villain's motivations, with the loss of a millionaire contract with the city to clean the city after the battle with the aliens for the joint venture formed by Stark Industries with the federal government, with the Control Department of Damages starting to supervise the collection and storage of alien materials. From then on, still having possession of an amount of alien technology in hand, Toomes begins to create his hyper-technological flying suit and to earn money by selling this technology to all types of criminals. All of this also awaits revenge with Tony Stark, amid preparations to move to the new headquarters of the Avengers. There is a human history there. The old bank robber, created in The Amazing Spider-Man # 2, undergoes a humanizing adaptation, becoming a figure with more understandable motivations here, even though greed has gone up in the character's head more and more after so long . join him and are gaining prominence throughout the film other enemies already well-known from Cabe√É¬ßa de Teia, such as Shocker, Scorpion and the Builder, all with their well-defined purposes and a lot of work with the scraps of the chitauri that destroyed part of Manhattan in the first Avengers.<br/><br/>Right at the beginning, it is interesting to see behind the scenes of the first scenes we saw of the hero together with the other Avengers, in 'Civil War' where the Friend of the Neighborhood is recruited for the first time by Tony Stark, who takes him to help him in the confrontation against Captain America and his allies in Berlin, in the famous airport sequence, with more than a dozen heroes meeting each other. These backstage are revealed through a cell phone, through the eyes of the teenager Peter Parker, showing all his dazzle and a lot of excitement in participating in all that alongside the Avengers. And it is in these scenes that we can, right from the start, have more of the always priceless interaction between Peter Parker, Tony Stark and Happy Hogan. It is precisely this chemistry and interaction between two super-sharp actors for comedy like Tom Holland and Robert Downey Jr and all this dynamics explored in some moments of mentor and pupil is one of the ingredients that make the film work. Despite the participation of Iron Man in key moments of this film, it is great that the film does not rely on the already established and popular Iron Man. Tony Stark is key to mentoring the young and still wandering arachnid hero and being the link between the film and the Avengers universe. The film is of Spider-Man all the time and it is he who is actually the protagonist here.<br/><br/>Having made this quick and efficient presentation of the villain, the script begins to set our hero in the world in which he lives two months after the events of 'Civil War'. Peter is an ordinary, superintelligent high school student who lives with his aunt May (Marisa Tomei). He is Ned's best friend (Jacob Batalon), and has to deal with the bullying of the Flash school bully (Tony Revolori), with the antisocial and sarcastic friend Michelle (Zendaya) and the passion he has for Liz (Laura Harrier), the captain of his Academic Decatlon team. In the meantime, he continues to await a new call from Tony Stark to join the Avengers while continuing to help people in ""not-so-heroic"" acts, thinking he could help more, on a really important mission. We followed Peter Parker's life at school and the problems that adolescence brings to a boy who, between chemistry and Spanish classes, wants to use his powers responsibly. There are also comical situations in which he ends up getting involved by pure immaturity. We see him falling in love with the high school girl, the school dance, the school's friends and rivals, the dilemmas and consequences. With references to 'O Clube dos Cinco (1985)' and 'Curtindo a Vida Adoidado (1986)', neither Spider-Man nor The Spectacular Spider-Man adopted high school as an organism as alive as Homecoming. The day-to-day life of high school still sounds pretty exhausting for Parker, but not at all boring for the public<br/><br/>When faced with real criminals using high tech weapons at a bank ATM, Peter begins to investigate the sale of this type of technological weapons by a band of criminals, which leads him to follow the Vulture. From that point on, we can see Peter dealing with the discovery of new features of his uniform with the help of the uniform assistant Karen (voice of Jennifer Connelly) in the Damage Control underground storage safe. The action scenes are original and well thought out. There are the scenes that take place at the Washington Monument, close to where the school Decathlon competition would take place in which Spider-Man saves his high school friends from the Chitauri explosive energy core that became a bomb when exposed to radiation. Another exciting sequence is set against the smuggled arms of weapons in yet another confrontation between Spider-Man and the Vulture, with the essential participation of Iron Man.<br/><br/>It is also curious, to note several small references to previous films of our hero that have already been brought to the screen, such as when Betty (Angourie Rice) says at school that Spider-Man can be 30 years old (Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield were around this age when they first debuted as the hero), or the scene in which Spider-Man tries to hold the parts of the boat reminding the hero by saving people from the subway accident in ""Spider-Man 2"", or even by lifting giant structures of concrete with its strength also seen in ""Spider-Man 2"". The internal references of the franchise are also there, whether in the videos of Captain America - it is even mentioned that he is now a wanted after the events of Civil War - in the imitations of Peter of Thor, and in the quotes from the colleges of Hulk and Black Widow, for example.
The character's romantic pair, Liz (Laura Harrier), on the other hand, is not as strong a figure as Mary Jane and Gwen Stacy were in the predecessor works. The chemistry between the girl and the hero is low, but there was no reason why this was really worked out by the script. The film itself guarantees the character the status of passing passion, being a good approximation to the source material, since Liz Allan, in the comics of the 60s, is also an affection - not at all relatable - from school, never proving to be true. In this sense, it is a faithful adaptation, because Liz Allan leaves for Oregon after the climax of the work, due to bombastic events.
However, the film insists on falling into some clich√É¬©s, such as the discovery of the villain being directly linked to someone important to him. For the initial physical difference, it is something that we could not make the immediate connection and it even surprises right away. However, it is a device used in all previous times, whether it is exactly the same in ""The Amazing Spider-Man"", or also exploring a relationship with someone directly connected, as in ""Spider-Man (2002)"" by Sam Raimi.
Finally portrayed here as a teenager, director Jon Watts explores very well all the insecurities and peculiarities of an ordinary teenager, who had discovered his powers a few months ago. We can notice the hero's portrayal in a phase full of challenges, self-knowledge, and learning from his own mistakes. Watts captured the essence of the Spider and understood that following Peter Parker's human dramas is much more fun and exciting than seeing big epic explosive battles (not that there aren't, as in any blockbuster). Another essential element here is that 'Back to Home' builds the basis for your script with the consequences that the actions of the heroes had on the lives of normal people. 'Back to Home' fully justifies yet another ""origin"" story of one of the most beloved characters in the audience."

"CabbageCustard","8","1","2","8 June 2019"," Not perfect, but still a lot of fun.
","I have to hand it to people who make superhero movies. They face considerable challenges, not the least of which is the streak of 'sameness' at the heart of many superhero story lines. You know how it goes: 1. We meet the superhero before they are a hero and see how they became a superhero 2. We meet the super villain and see why they became a villain 3. The superhero meets the public and all is good 4. The superhero meets the villain and now it's not so good 5. The superhero suffers some defeat or disgrace and accompanying confidence crisis and the public aren't so enamoured any more. 6. The superhero gets his/her act together and defeats the villain after all.
To be sure, some superhero movies break this pattern, but most follow it in some way or another. The trick is to follow the pattern in a way that is new, fresh and worth people spending their money to see. Spider-Man Homecoming manages to do that by making Peter Parker/Spiderman a fresh faced 15 year old being mentored by an older, avuncular Tony Stark. Of course, Spiderman isn't played by a 15-year old. Tom Holland is about 6 years older than that. It would have made more sense to say Spiderman was 18-years old, but oh well.... He is good in the role though and I look forward to seeing him in the sequel(s). Michael Keaton makes a pretty good villain too. He is intelligent and menacing. The story is also good.<br/><br/>There are some flaws with this movie though. It doesn't stick to established Spiderman canon for a start. Tony Stark was never Spiderman's mentor and Spidey's suit was never like the one in this movie. Also, Spidey's spider sense never shows up. Spiderman purists will be disappointed. There is also some pretty bad CGI. By 'bad' I mean it is obviously fake. We know these movies couldn't exist without CGI, but the trick is to not make it look like CGI. This movie doesn't always do that successfully. One of the biggest bugbears for me though was the way the Spiderman canon was unnecessarily changed to make it more racially diverse. Flash Thompson, a big, muscly, dopey jock in the comics, is a weedy, cowardly Indian here. MJ, Peter's girlfriend, is supposed to be a bright, vivacious red-head. Here she is a sullen, smart alec African-American. Worse still, she is played by the totally dreary Zendaya. I hope she's not going to stick around for future movies. I would have preferred to see Zendaya and Laura Harrier, who plays Liz, swap roles. Still, in spite of its flaws, Spider-Man Homecoming is fun and not a bad way to spend two hours or so."

","Homecoming is the newest reimagining of Spider-Man we've had (this time with a younger aunt May). It paints spider man as a still young and naive kid thanks to Tom Holland's performance and uses that for a basis of growth. The movie spends little to no time at all introducing Peter, as Marvel assumes that after five movies you already know the character. Peter learns to find the balance between getting help from others and doing things alone. Also like Tony Stark does in Iron Man 3, who is his mentor by the way, he learns how to be a hero without the suit. The love interest, Liz, serves little purpose but Ned is incredibly funny as a sidekick. Overall just a fun version of Spider-Man."

It really feels like these are Spidey's early years. Getting used to his abilities and the high-tech suit that Tony made for him as well as the crazy upgrades.<br/><br/>It has issues with some of the side characters, Zendaya playing a character with the nickname ""MJ"" when Mary-Jane is not in the movie was a bit of cop-out. Flash Thompson goes a bit too overboard with the name-calling but Ned Leeds is always very funny and the chemistry between him and Peter was really entertaining to watch.<br/><br/>It's funny, charming, quirky and great fun as a Spider-Man movie should be!"

"paul_haakonsen","6","1","2","30 December 2018"," Oh joy, another Spider-Man movie...
","Right, well another year and another superhero movie, seems about the turn of the mill these recent years. Was I thrilled when this movie was announced? No. Did I stand in line to watch it in the cinema? No.<br/><br/>Well, I watched ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" solely because I had the chance, not because it was a pressing matter on my 'movies-to-watch' list.<br/><br/>So did the world really need another Spider-Man movie? Well, not really, not if you ask me. And all this rebooting is just to the point of being ridiculous. Did we need a new actor to play Spider-Man? Hardly so.<br/><br/>That being said, then I will say that Tom Holland actually fared well enough in the role as Peter Parker and Spider-Man. However, it was such a thrill and a blast to watch Michael Keaton in the movie, he was really so well-cast for the villain role and did so magnificently. His character was rather fun and interesting, and wore a cool outfit. However, I can't claim to be much fan of the high-tech Spider-Man outfit, however.<br/><br/>""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" turned out to be fun and entertaining, but at the same time it was just another run of the mill superhero movie in my opinion. There was a little bit too much focus on how much destruction Spider-Man could muster in this movie, which made the movie feel a bit campy and corny.<br/><br/>Being a Marvel movie, you know that you are in for a treat in the special effects department. And sure enough, the Marvel camp delivered a movie cramped with amazing special effects and superb CGI.<br/><br/>Hardly a movie that I will watch a second time around, but then again that is how I feel about all superhero movies."
"master_sullivan","7","1","2","24 October 2018"," I love Spiderman but this movie is disapointing
","Let me just say Spidey is my favorite super hero period. DC or Marvel. But thsi movie had SO MUCH potential. I love the special effects and the fresh take on Spiderman! Hes younger, he has a sidekick, and his Aunt, May, is....hot? BUt the real problem with this movie and what puts it below every one except Amazing Spiderman 1(which was like a 6/10 and poor) was Spiderman himself. Tony comes off like his ""father figure"" which makes sense. But I feel this dynamic is only good in Avengers 3 thus far.<br/><br/>Spiderman is too young. He's 15....hes too NERDY. Hes the most outgoing of the 3 incarnations . Yeeah easily..lol. Homecoming > Amazing > Original trilogy. So im like this dude has ALL the tools to get the girl. I love Liz in the movie. Cause shes a intelligent tall black woman. But he doenst get the girl. Thats my beef here. Its like his predecessors they undestood im Spiderman 2nd and Peter first. Homecoming SM his motivations dont make any sense. He does the right thing at Homecoming by stopping the vilain who's Lizs Dad. It just doesnt make sense. He could have explained his actions to Liz.<br/><br/>I do love the action, and i love MJ's character. Yes Zendaya plays Michelle aka MJ. Its a good twist. I think the sequel will be an 8/10 or 9...but this one is average. And Marvel movies are typically very good. Thor 2 is worse than this. Antman is 7 also. But the other ones ive seen are typically 8-10 range."

Iron man and Marvel were too dominant in this one.<br/><br/>Although the villain Vulture played by Michael Keaton was amazing. His motivation and his character development was realistic and quite fascinating. A sense of excitement went by as long as he was on screen. Other then him Tom Holland was also good as Spiderman. He followed essence of character well enough. Much better then Andrew Garfield in Amazing Spiderman. Alas, his effort was submerged in overshadowed by Downey as Stark and overall approach of Marvel for this story. Other then these whole cast was trash. MJ is really an annoying sleep deprived girl. Flash is a small Indian rich guy. Give me a break. Although Ned was somewhat ok and provided some comic relief. Can live with that.<br/><br/>For next part they should follow Peter journey in discovering his own powers and motivations. He has so much more than Stark provided suit. Genius level intelligence, Super Strength/physical durability and Spidey sense (a hint was seen in Infinity war). And also they can bring in some interesting characters from comics.<br/><br/>Music is fine with almost all Marvel movies."

","Peter Parker is bitten by a radioactive spider and learns to use his new powers - to climb and spin web - for the greater good, in case you didn't know the story. Notwithstanding the technical artistry, visual effects and a solid enough storyline, the lead character could be construed as an over-excited portrayal of the Peter Parker character that older audiences are accustomed to, for this is a teenage comedy. The main battle sequence does not stir and this is mainly due to the overuse of CGI which makes this look more like a cartoon than a live action movie.
All in all it feels like an inconsequential edition to the already marvellous film series. The set pieces are unremarkable but Holland's ability to capture the restless adolescent spirit who needs public affirmation is good. It will be a giddy treat for teenagers...but it will grate with some older viewers."

Keaton was great once he went full supervillain, Parker was much better once he calmed down after Tony took away the toys. Ned was great. There was still too much CGI for my liking, the stealth plane sequence was so manic and crammed with SFX it just looked like a video game. Watchable but could have been a lot better imo."
"nishantvarma","6","1","2","24 November 2017"," Good Movie, but not a good ""Spiderman"" movie!
","It's a good watch, if you aren't much into comics and the shows you will definitely enjoy the movie to some extent but if you really know who Spidey is then you will HATE most parts of the movie. First of all Spiderman never really relied on tech, In SMH we see peter doing all those great things because of his suit, the suit literally tells him what to do, when to sit when to talk and when to kiss like really! This isn't an iron man movie, I know times are changing and everything's gotta adapt that way but whoa really? You might as well give him an iron man suit while you're at it. Spiderman purely relied on his own abilities, we have seen him fight with his suit ripped to shreds and THAT makes him awesome. The Spidey sense is GONE! That's like Thor without his hammer. Also the driving force of what makes spiderman ""Spiderman"" is uncle Ben, his vision to be a man like him in his own way, not some wannabe superhero trying to impress Iron man. Also spiderman is not DUMB he can hack his own suit, look through enemy's strategy and stuff with ease as opposed to in the movie. The cast was horrible, Flash is an average Indian dude playing quiz with the 5-6 people we see, he's pretty likable which is NOT supposed to happen with flash, Spidey's best friend is a fat Asian, the girl calling herself MJ is not really relevant until she calls herself that, the movie tries hard to stuff diversity in our faces, nothing wrong at all with this cast IF you are making any other movie but if you're gonna cast a black dude for superman or a white dude for black panther or cyborg then you're doing it wrong mate! The movie has some really bad logic, like the chitauri core doesn't seem harmful until the suit tells peter it's harmful, it's understandable after the x-ray machine but even before that it starts to act weird when it was pretty harmless all the time peter held it everywhere. The Washington monument is damaged and no one gives a f*ck why it happened no investigation nothing, if that happened the fat harry and peter would've been in custody for pretty long. Also the core which was starting to turn into a small sun, burning sheets and making the bag glow doesn't harm fat harry at all! The ship gets sliced into half with lasers shooting everywhere and no one even gets injured! What happened to green goblin throwing balls and vaporizing people into skeletons?"

Although, there may be a few flaws, like, they didn't add more. I mean, even a cameo of Venom could've helped, but I guess we can't expect everything from this movie.

Michael Keaton did his job as vulture as anybody could imagine he is my favorite spider man movie villein so far his performance was exceptionally good he was the perfect bad guy this young spider man kid could go up against. bad things about the movie was the story was predictable i could literately guess the next scene on some times some appearances was not that as like the hype was like Donald Glover's appearance. and the trailers gave away many parts of the movie anyway that was our fault watching them all not a perfect movie my ratings are 6.5stars looking forward to see the sequels"
"markcalway","7","1","2","28 September 2017"," Different...good...but too long
","The idea behind Spider-man homecoming is good. The film concentrates more on the life of a 15 year old Peter Parker trying to be both a teenager and Spiderman (or is it Spider-boy?). <br/><br/>The main villain is Vulture - Michael Keaton. He makes a good villain, selling illegal arms stolen from the aliens that came to battle in the Avengers films.<br/><br/>However, it is way too long. The Vulture is good, but really isn't that evil and really shouldn't take nearly 3 hours to defeat. It is naturally all about the development of Spider-man. However, it becomes tiresome, especially as most of the film is CGI overload. Similar in a way to what is happening to Transformers, the production teams feel the need to try lots and lots of different spectacular stunts and effects playing to build a plot. This is better than recent Transformers as the plot does make sense and does build to the end and potential future Spider-man films. <br/><br/>In all it is fun and it is good to see Spider-man having fun rather than being all about the death of his Uncle Ben or any other family member (which isn't in this film at all). Aunt May is, however she is a younger and actually hotter version.<br/><br/>Watch it, but make sure you are sitting comfortably."

","After news broke out that Sony and Marvel are sharing the rights for the character of Spiderman, many feared what would happen to their favourite superhero. After the introduction to MCU last year in Civil War, the reviews were full of praise for the young Tom Holland and his presentation of the character. Now, one year later it was time for Tom Holland himself to show us what he can do in Spiderman: Homecoming.<br/><br/>Peter Parker is attending Middle School as he tries to make time for his ""Internship"" in Stark Industries and establish himself as the new addition to the Avengers team and continue his education. After initially solving only ""local"" crimes, a bank robbery that he prevents features a deadly weapon, apparently from out-of-space materials. Unable to seek help from Tony Stark or his assistant Happy, he decides to investigate the case.<br/><br/>Spiderman: Homecoming is a great movie and we can say that Tom Holland is perfectly cast as the new Spidey. Robert Downey Jr. and Michael Keaton are the more experienced actors in the movie and without their charisma Holland would have had a much more difficult job to adjust to the role.<br/><br/>Homecoming is a good movie, but the fact that is so different from previous Spiderman movies is very noticeable. However, we will give Marvel a chance to make Spiderman a worldwide superhero, instead of a neighbourhood hero he so far was."
"WondrousMoose","7","1","2","18 July 2017"," Fun and full of laughs, Spider-Man: Homecoming fits right in with Marvel's ever-expanding Cinematic Universe.
","It's been about a month since a major superhero film release, so here we are again!<br/><br/>Marvel is at bat now, and they've brought out their most iconic superhero, Spider-Man. We got a peek at him in last year's Captain America: Civil War, so now that he has his own film, let's see what it has to offer.<br/><br/>Spider-Man: Homecoming follows a teenage Peter Parker (Tom Holland) shortly after his discovery by the Avengers. He can't seem to keep their attention, though, as he dreams of saving people on a larger scale. Meanwhile, Adrian Toomes (Michael Keaton), a local construction worker, has been hoarding leftover alien technology from the attack on New York in The Avengers and is selling hi-tech weaponry around New York City. Parker must learn to balance his high school life with his desire to impress the Avengers to hopefully stop this homegrown menace.<br/><br/>Without a doubt, the best part of the movie is our main character. His two most recent representations on film have been strong in their own ways, but were fairly weak in their portrayal of high school. In Homecoming, Parker's life and struggles as a smart kid with a huge crush on a classmate are now shown with refreshing sincerity; one particularly heartfelt and awkward scene hit me in such a genuine way that I immediately felt a dozen high school memories of my own come rushing back. Holland is infectiously enthusiastic throughout in his portrayal of the young hero and might be my favorite take on the character to date.<br/><br/>With great heroes must come great villains, and Michael Keaton absolutely knocks it out of the park with his performance as Vulture. In the tradition of other Spider-Man villains, Homecoming presents an ordinary, down-on-his-luck man who goes in over his head and is corrupted by power. The suit that he wears is genuinely intimidating, and Keaton portrays his character with a mix of the charismatic persona we're familiar with from the '80s and '90s and the unhinged performance he gave in 2014's Birdman. I hope we see more of him in the future.<br/><br/>While the film succeeds with several of its characters, though, it is very shallow and ultimately lacks heart. Homecoming is a fun movie, but it is little more than that and fails to offer real emotional depth. The movie actually seems afraid to let the viewer really feel something; dramatic moments are consistently broken with jokes, and we learn only in passing dialog that Peter and Aunt May have recently lost Uncle Ben. This tragedy was traditionally the kicking-off point for Parker's heroic journey, but we don't meet him at any time, and neither of the ""mourning"" characters so much as frowns over the event.<br/><br/>Maybe Wonder Woman has me spoiled, but Spider-Man also doesn't feel like much of a hero in this one. Homecoming nailed the character of a high school Peter Parker but left Spider-Man awkwardly stumbling through people's back yards with almost no character growth throughout the film. This is a sort of origin story, but I had hoped he would feel more amazing by the end credits. My concern is that he is left to develop in the time before the next film or carry his clumsiness into it.<br/><br/>Despite its flaws, though, Spider-Man: Homecoming is absolutely worth a watch. It offers a fun, colorful experience that corrects some of the shortcomings of our hero's recent outings while standing alone as both a Spider-Man film and a worthwhile entry to the ever- expanding MCU."
"vborn","9","1","2","18 July 2017"," Good balance between humour and tension
","This is another unique superhero movie and we should really stop complaining about them. Just look how many wonderful movies we've seen from Marvel and DC franchise in the past few years: Logan, Wonder Woman, Deadpool, Civil War etc. and now an amazing executed re-boot of Spider-Man. <br/><br/>The most interesting point everybody is watching for is how this totally new interpretation of Spidey played by Tom Holland is executed. First of all, I wouldn't pick the best Spider-Man. The Tobey Maguire Spider-Man was the most bad-ass one and he is struggling way more in his life. But this guy right here is more like the Comic Spider-Man. He actually is young and really is portrayed as a high school student. He isn't struggling that much in his life and he is a very more humorous guy. In Civil War I was firstly a bit irritated by him, but in this movie I was really amazed by his character and by the well-done performance by Tom Holland. But I think the best part about this Spidey is that he is totally not OP. He's just a talent and this aspect gives the suspense in the movie. He could fail more easily than other super- heroes.<br/><br/>What amazed me most were the character developments. The Avengers movies are great, nonetheless there is a big lack of character development in those movies. But in this one, you felt like every character has a big potential to deliver. Not only we did get a great villain with Vulture. But even the supporting characters such as the other students were very interesting designed. <br/><br/>And all of these characters were performed very good. As you have noticed the best performance was by Michael Keaton. I think the actual attractive part of his character is not his character, but he himself. Every expression he delivered felt perfect. But to be honest, everyone did well. Also noteworthy is the Disney Star Zendaya as Michelle, Jacob Batalon as Ned and we all know that Childish Gambino is an underrated actor. Although his character was only a small part, he was great. <br/><br/>Don't expect the atmosphere of the first Spider-Man movie here, because this is a totally different situation - totally different story. And there are always some millimeter-detail-watching haters out there, so don't let them confuse you. I just read a complain, where the complainer thought Flash is playing the superhero flash... If you don't get why his name is flash, you also shouldn't complain about less depth..."
"Deadpool1969","9","1","2","18 July 2017"," How Spider-Man should have been portrayed
","First off, I am a huge fan of the Tobey McGuire Spiderman movies (except for 3 for obvious reasons) and the first Andrew Garfield movie was acceptable but still lacked that spark of the originals.<br/><br/>This movie however captures how Spiderman should have been portrayed all along..an awkward teenager who is always unsure of himself, wanting to be accepted by his peers yet still retains that wonder and innocence of youth and discovery.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed Tom Holland's portrayal of the webslinger in Captain America: Civil War and he even further nails it in this movie. Tony Stark's appearances were hilarious, but it was Happy that stole the show along with Ned. Ned was just a hilarious and funny friend to Peter and I got a lot of laughs out of his role.<br/><br/>Michael Keaton's portrayal as Vulture was also incredible, by the end of the movie I had totally forgotten he was Batman and now associate him with Vulture.<br/><br/>This is a must see movie you'll love it!"
"EmbraceTheGeek","8","1","2","16 July 2017"," A Fresh New Take on a Timeless Character
","I came in the Spider-Man Homecoming with high expectations as Marvel has put out solid movies despite playing it safe. It has a sense of realism that made it easy to connect to the film and its themes. I was not disappointed. The film thrives as it focuses on a young Peter Parker who is still struggling with finding his place as a young hero. His journey contains trials that would be found at the age of someone in high school which he has to also balance with his responsibilities of having powers too. The film is paced well and Tom Holland portrays the role of Peter Parker with a certain charisma that most viewers will enjoy. Michael Keaton is also very versatile in his villain role with his compelling acting. The supporting characters did well alongside Tom, and watching Zendaya's role was especially entertaining as she is not in the movie that much but delivers some of the better lines in the film. Overall, the film plays it safe, but is a much more fresh take on the Marvel formula then films like Ant-Man and Doctor Strange. I would definitely recommend that you give it a watch as it is one of the stronger films to come out this summer."
"lumiens","7","1","2","15 July 2017"," Saw the third reboot - it was okay.
","I took my wife and three boys to see the movie tonight. My boys gave the movie a ranking of 8-9 on a 10 pt scale; while my wife and I gave it a 7.<br/><br/>I felt that the story was okay: okay character development, an okay story arc and better than average acting from Spidey and the Vulture. <br/><br/>Now,again, understand that my children didn't grow up with comic books. They haven't seen all three different versions of Spider-Man brought to the big screen. My boys liked this movie a great deal and so will most adolescents. However, if you are older and have had more than a passing interest in the original story, lower your expectations.<br/><br/>Honestly, there was nothing bad here - but there was nothing better than what I've seen before. Each previous actor: Toby McGuire, Andrew Garfield and now this new young man - brought something different.<br/><br/>The first two Spidey movies had great action suquences, they were very good and Toby did a great job. Then, came Andrew Garfield's movies and there was chemistry galore between Spidey and Gwen.<br/><br/>The third time's the charm right? To succeed as a new reboot you can't retread what the other two versions covered. So, this new movie focuses more on the anxiety of being a very young web-slinger. Furthermore, to modernize this movie, the director added/changed a great deal of the supporting details that I thought I knew.<br/><br/>I understand the move...they want this to be accessible to a wider audience. The director made an effort to make this movie more politically correct. Coming from an older comic fan's perspective, this challenged my preconception of the world that Spider-man used to inhabit. Things are always changing - right? <br/><br/>However, if Marvel wants change things why keep the old Spidey/Peter Parker story line and not go with their Mexican-American version with Miles Morales? Why not make Ned an overweight Spider-Man? Why can't the main characters find a love interest that is a normal, smart, average looking person, you know...that type you find in every high school? Wanna shake things up? Under the suit Iron-Man could be Pepper Potts - right? The power comes from the money and the electronics. Let's be blunt, even Marvel said that the new Thor was going to be female.<br/><br/>Maybe, after all I've written, I'm tired after viewing too many Marvel formulaic adventures. The movie is somewhere between okay and good."
"BA_Harrison","6","4","18","4 July 2019"," Raimi's Spidey is still the best (not including Part 3).
","I had a reasonably fun time with Spiderman Homecoming, but I have a few big issues that prevent me from loving it...<br/><br/>Firstly, Peter Parker's vulnerability/invulnerability. There's a scene where Spiderman bangs his head on the roof of a truck, knocking himself unconscious, yet later on in the film, a couple of tons of concrete and steel land on the lad's head with no lasting damage. Not long after, Peter falls to the ground from a crashing jet (presumably travelling at a couple of hundred miles an hour) and gets up without a problem. Concussion one minute, indestructible the next!<br/><br/>Spiderman's strength is inconsistent too: Peter is holding together two halves of the Staten Island ferry in one scene, but later he is struggling to free himself from some rubble.<br/><br/>I also have a problem with The Avengers' very lax approach to shifting their equipment to new premises: Happy (Jon Favreau) loads all of the Avenger's weapons/armour onto an unmanned aircraft - not one person to guard it. Of course, this suited the plot, but it was extremely daft. Surely a couple of superheroes could have taken time out from saving the world to escort the precious cargo.<br/><br/>Last moan: did Spidey really need a high-tech suit equipped with AI and special assault modes? I thought Spiderman relied on Spidey sense.<br/><br/>On a more positive note, I enjoyed Peter's trials and tribulations at high-school, and thought that the twist revelation about the true identity of Vulture was well handled (I didn't see it coming). The special effects are, as always, very impressive, and Director Jon Watts handles the action well enough, but Sam Raimi needn't worry: his first two Spiderman movies remain the best."

No one seems to care that alien tech is being used in common crimes. How stupid is that.<br/><br/>Spiderman is a boy obsessed to become a part of avengers. he looks like a kid who rode the bicycle for the first time and dying to have the second ride and for that the kid does all type of acts to get attention. <br/><br/>Movie is more centered about Avengers and what Ironman means to spiderman. No solid action scenes. Spiderman is converted into another ironman type thing with super suit and nothing more. And the kid is taking down stuff not knowing the capabilities. <br/><br/>all in all, i was utterly disappointed by the movie. was expected a good platform to introduce new spiderman that was to be a part of Avengers in next movies.

"ekavalaa","7","6","34","3 July 2017"," Spider-Man: Homecoming is the best Spidey movie ever made
","IT MAY seem ridiculous, rebooting Spider-Man for the third time in 15 years but after seeing Spider-Man: Homecoming, you'll be glad they did. The Tobey Maguire Spider-Man of 2002 was fine; the Andrew Garfield Amazing Spider-Man of 2012 was also fine. The Tom Holland Spider-Man of 2017 is the best Spider-Man movie ever to grace the screen. Spider- Man: Homecoming is the perfect blend of high school dramedy and superhero antics. This is Marvel's homage to John Hughes, complete with Ferris Bueller reference. By taking it back to the school setting and ageing Spidey down to 15 years old, it recaptures some of the innocent magic gleaned in the comic pages. It also, for a movie with a flying villain and an altitude-defying superhero, grounds the story. One of the main criticisms of superhero blockbusters is that they're overblown with ever-increasing, imminent apocalypses and cities toppling over, usually in a stupidly bombastic third act. Here, the stakes are much smaller, as is the body count with Peter turning off his suit's ""kill mode"" as quickly as he realised it existed. For this Spider-Man, asking a girl to the homecoming dance is as fraught as stopping the bad guy. Our reintroduction to this iteration of Spider-Man starts with a home video Peter shot on his phone of all the behind-the-scenes action of his adventure with the Avengers. It's cheeky, fun and a clever reminder of what a big hit the character was in Captain America: Civil War and how Holland managed to steal every scene he was in from much, much bigger stars. It sets the tone for the whole movie as we join Peter at his science high school where he and his Star Wars-loving friend Ned (Jacob Batalon) aren't the most popular kids in school. Here, Peter has to worry about Spanish quizzes, winning the academic decathlon and keeping his secret identity under wraps from the classmates he saves. In many ways, it has more than a touch of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.<br/><br/>Thanks , Rijil www.ekavala.in"

","Worst spider-man ever. I could have posted a bitter 1 star review but that wouldn't have been a true reflection. This was an average movie at best, it had some fun moments but really at the end of it I didn't really feel anything. They are going mental with these reboots, I wonder who will play the next spiderman in 3 years time. This is getting out of hand. I hope everyone simply boycotts the next movies to teach marvel/Sony a lesson.Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker was the best version of the friendly neighbourhood spiderman there was, why fix something that wasn't broken? As for this movie it was far too avengers orientated, introducing new characters, villains and sidekicks. There is no origin story here. Spiderman exists from the start so it continues from where they left of in the captain America movie. Also it seemed pretty clear that they were playing towards some diversity quota with an influx of oriental and black actors. It seemed kind of forced upon us, didn't seem natural as far as the movie goes. They were clearly aiming for the huge Chinese market to get more $$$. Marisa tomei is clearly miscast as aunt may. Holland doesn't fit his role as spiderman well either, he seems more of a pre pubescent version of the superhero. Michael Keaton does well in his villainous role. His character and his cleanup team are forced to sell alien technology weapons in order to make ends meet after being put out of work by clean up teams organised by the government. Spiderman spots them and tries to stop them, succeeds in the end. That's the movie basically. There is some comedy and romance that seemed wooden thrown in. There was no chemistry whatsoever. An average affair."

"barbagvido","9","2","7","31 August 2017"," ""Friendly-neighborhood"" is back on track!
","Spider-Man:Homecoming had a lot of reasons to be bad. It's a second reboot in 5 freaking years, the very spoilery trailers, and there seemed to be over- reliance on the MCU with Tony Stark looking like he has a major part in the story (which kinda disgraces Spidey as a character, since he always manages on his own and that's what makes him such a great character). Well, thankfully, it only seemed so. Because this is one of the best Spider-Man movies.<br/><br/>To be honest, I never hated The Amazing Spider-Man movies. Yes, the second one was really weird, but I didn't really hate that one either. I just thought they had a lot of greater potential to reach, so when they quit with that series and decided to give it a reboot in the MCU, I was a bit skeptical. I really liked Holland's performance in Captain America:Civil War, that was a great start and even after two actors, Holland managed to bring the character of Peter Parker in another unique way (and that's the case in this movie too). But, based on the trailers, I didn't like where the whole thing was going. Spidey movies always had a unique feel to them and this looked like just another generic Marvel movie that doesn't even respect its character enough. It turns out, this is probably the best depiction of the character yet. Maguire wasn't much as Spider-Man, but he was a great Peter Parker. Garfield was a great Spider-Man, but too cool of a Peter Parker. Holland works beautifully as both. And that whole Tony Stark thing, he's really not in the movie that much and Peter gets around all by himself, just like it should be. The performances were all very good if not great and the characters are very likable, but one actor I would like to point out is Michael Keaton as the villain, The Vulture. He is incredible. Quite possibly the best Spidey movie villain yet. He's not bland, nor over the top. He's just the right amount of menace. And it's fantastic. There is even a certain plot twist that will make him all the more menacing, you will see for yourself. I also loved how, while the film might not have the feel of the rest of the Spidey movies, it doesn't have that same old MCU feel either. It has its own thing and it rocks.<br/><br/>But still, since I gave it a 9, there are some drawbacks I would like to point out. There are still some characters that are changed way too much. They don't even feel like the same characters, but I will not reveal who exactly. It's not that they are bad, but it just didn't feel right. Also, in order to add some more humor, I guess, Spidey is one bit too clumsy. And when he's in action, he should (mostly) slay it. And also, I get it that showing the origin for the third time already would be a drag, but they just threw it away, so we have a complete lack of origin. If in some case you don't know origin, don't expect to get it here. I was hoping there will be a creative way to show it again in a fast way (like in The Incredible Hulk) or at least mention it. But nope, it's completely left in the air.<br/><br/>Still, let alone these minor flaws, this was a surprisingly very good and fun outing with a lot of respect to the source material and a unique feel on its own. Looking forward to see more!"
"cdjh-81125","8","2","7","24 August 2017"," Spider Man Comes Home
","Being completely honest, I wasn't really sold on Spider Man Homecoming on the lead up to its release, I was always an advocate for Andrew Garfield and his interpretation of the character and thought his series came to a premature end. Beyond that the trailers weren't really grabbing me and I wasn't too sure if Tom Holland could carry an entire movie for me, but while I wasn't floored I was pleasantly surprised by what I got. <br/><br/>Tom Holland is really coming into his own as this character, he's still my least favourite out of the three live action adaptions but he brought a real humanity to this role, you got the sense that he really was inexperienced yet excited to be this hero and you bought his performance all the way through. I really liked Robert Downey Jr in this movie, his character was a lot more mature in this film in his mentor role to Peter but he never lost that entertainment value that makes people love him. Happy Hogan was also a welcome addition that had great chemistry with Holland. <br/><br/>One positive I have for this film is something I haven't had for many other MCU films; the villain. I actually loved the Vulture in this film, not only was Michael Keaton fantastic in this movie as him but the character himself was just very well written, he had excellent motivation that I could understand, you never got the sense that he was a naturally bad man but instead a good guy who wasn't in a bad situation and didn't come out of it for the better. <br/><br/>I also loved how they handled Spider-Man himself in this movie, we've never really seen him in high school in any of his other films so it was a good decision to put him in that situation. In every film the character always struggled with balancing Peter Parker and Spider Man but it was done in a more relatable way. It was great to see him in his infancy as a superhero, a lot of humour directed at his inexperience and his need to prove himself, despite all the cgi and superpowers it felt like a more grounded and more realistic addition to this franchise. <br/><br/>It's great to see Marvel give smaller directors chances and Jon Watts really took to the task, a lot of the directing in the high school scenes felt really old fashioned and really well edited but he does a really good job with the action scenes, again he adds something if a realism to them that makes you feel Peters vulnerability. <br/><br/>As much as I enjoyed this film it isn't perfect, the pacing in this film wasn't the best. Homecoming cuts back and forth between Peter and Spider-Man and him at high school and the divide isn't done very well, just when the film starts to get quicker with him as Spider-Man he'll go back to high school for a while and the pacing gets a lot slower and this is repeated about 3 or 4 times throughout the run time and did kill the momentum a bit. <br/><br/>While I loved the main villain of the Vulture the supporting antagonists weren't handled very well, they just feel like disposable characters with no result purpose other than to just add more comic characters to this film. The film wouldn't really have been any different had they not been in here which is a shame because there could have been a lot more done with them. <br/><br/>While it's not quite my favourite of the franchise, it was nothing if not a pleasant surprise. The tone was perfect, it has something of a realism to it, Holland and Keaton are both excellent in this film and we finally have another strong MCU villain. While the pacing isn't the best and some of the supporting villains could have been handled better, while I was very sceptical about a new version of this character I was glad to be proved wrong. <br/><br/>8.4/10: A- (Fantastic)"
"joelsave","10","2","7","6 August 2017"," Best stand alone marvel movie since iron man 1!
","This movie had everything a good superhero movie needs. Action, humor and a fantastic lead role. Tom Holland is easily the best spider-man yet but I cant say Toby was bad either. Tom Hollands performance was extraordinary both is spider-man but also as the high school kid Peter Parker. RDJ also did a good job as a mentor for Peter which helped the story to continue forward and also made the story feel relate-able and real for the viewers. It's hard to forget how good the supporting teenagers in the film were. Jacob Bolton did a good job as Peters nerdy friend Ned and Zendaya as Peters crush. These characters made the Tom as Peter a much more complete character. This is what I loved about the movie.<br/><br/>As entertaining as the movie was I found it weird why everyone loved Mickeal Keaton's Voulture so much. It's one of the better MCU villains but he is quite boring sometimes. But he has a clear and good motivation which can oversee his boring dialogues. But compare to other MCU villains he does a good job. And to be honest, the villain wasn't that important which is good because this is a Spiderman movie and not a Voulture movie.<br/><br/>I would say that this is the best spider-man movie and the 4th MCU movie after Avengers 1, Guaridians 1 and iron man 1.

"shawn_m_roeder","9","2","7","12 July 2017"," A Realistic Villain
","I love comic book movies. However, it gets tiresome watching the continued parade of super villains with grand agendas to take over and/or destroy the world. Michael Keaton's well-played Vulture has no such grand designs. He just wants to support his family comfortably, even if his business is less than legal. He uses the deeds of those who are more rich and powerful than him as justification. That's it. No grand designs to take over the world, and no deliberate attempt at mass destruction (although that accompanies any decent comic book movie regardless). When teenager Peter Parker interferes with those plans, the only revenge plot is to keep Spider-man from interfering with his family business. Again, simple plans. It is the simplicity of the villain and the superhero that made this movie a breath of fresh air in comparison with its competitors. This is one of the best comic book movies since The Dark Knight."
"roblesar99","8","2","7","12 July 2017"," A Triumphant Return for Marvel's Favorite Hero
","Jon Watts' Spider-Man: Homecoming reboots the series for the second time in the past five years, with Tom Holland taking over the role of Peter Parker. Unlike the Spider-Man we meet in the films of Sam Raimi and Marc Webb, however, this Spider-Man has already been in costume for a while, ditching the origin story and moving right on to the neighborhood heroics. With Holland in the lead role, Homecoming provides us with the best interpretation of the classic superhero thus far. Holland perfectly captures the spirit of the character, awkward, charming, and humorous in equal measure. While Spider-Man 2 still remains the cinematic high point of Marvel's iconic wall-crawling webslinger, Homecoming comes close to knocking it off that perch.<br/><br/>The film works because it's not concerned with over-the-top heroics of other MCU films where thousands of lives are at stake because of some nefarious plot. Watts' film is much more grounded and instead, Homecoming is content to masquerade as the 16th entry in this cinematic universe when it actually functions as more of a high school coming-of-age film in the vein of John Hughes' seminal '80s classics. The film serves as a breath of a fresh air in a post-The Dark Knight world, a fun lighthearted feature that provides as many laughs as it does thrills. Holland, whose work in J.A. Bayona's The Impossible convinced me that he was a great choice for the role, not only carries the film, but also pulls off the feat of being both a great Peter Parker and Spider-Man.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Michael Keaton's turn as the Vulture gives Spider-Man his best villain since Doc Ock, and a third act twist allows for the character to achieve a semblance of complexity rarely seen in most of the MCU's other films. Indeed, the Vulture works as a villain because he is cut from the same cloth as Spider-Man, an ordinary man whose life changes because of an unforeseen event. While other rogues in the MCU have been concerned with destroying the world or tearing the Avengers apart, the Vulture's main concern lies with protecting his family. Keaton's characterization allows for the Vulture to retain a sense of humanity that the audience can empathize with, even if his actions are indeed criminal.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast remains strong all across the board. Zendaya makes the most of her role as Michelle, one of Peter's classmates, despite her limited screen time. Laura Harrier does a solid job as Liz, Parker's love interest, but the relationship between the two feels underdeveloped despite the couple of solid scenes that they share together. Meanwhile, Jacob Batalon serves as excellent comic relief in the role of Ned, Peter's best friend. The friendship between him and Peter is wholly believable, as the two of them struggle together to fit in. The characters that populate the high school all feel like genuine teenagers, including Tony Revolori's take on Flash Thompson. No longer a jock, Thompson instead serves as Parker's academic rival. While the portrayal of the character might anger long-term purists, it works for the film, even if Thompson can't quite be described as intimidating. <br/><br/>On the other hand, Jon Favreau reprises his role as Happy Hogan, and his performance is one of the film's many highlights. Hogan's sarcastic demeanor opposite Parker's unbridled enthusiasm makes for some hilarious exchanges between the two. As for Robert Downey, Jr., I was glad to see that he truly was relegated to a supporting role. I enjoy the character of Tony Stark, but I felt that too much focus on his character could have potentially taken away from the film. However, unlike Captain America: Civil War, which could have easily been titled Avengers 2.5 despite being the third entry in the Captain America trilogy, this is first and foremost a Spider-Man film. While Downey, Jr. still plays an important role, he mainly functions as a sort of mentor for Parker, who still struggles to find his place in the world after the events of Civil War. And lastly, Marisa Tomei delivers a solid performance as Aunt May. Portraying the youngest interpretation of the character on screen thus far, she serves in equal doses as both a motherly figure and a friend to Parker.<br/><br/>As for the film's action sequences, Watts allows for a great variety to them, straying away from the typical skyscraper action that has dominated prior Spider-Man films. Taking place anywhere from a bank to the Staten Island ferry and even the Washington Monument, each of these sequences proves thrilling while demonstrating that other films in the MCU need not put thousands of lives in danger to create tension. By grounding the action and the characters, Watts differentiates the film from the rest of the MCU and allows it to somewhat break free from the corporate mold by giving it a sense of purpose. The film functions as Parker's continuing struggles to grow as both a superhero and a high school student, and so Watts wisely relegates the action to the background.<br/><br/>However, as previously mentioned, Homecoming only somewhat breaks from the corporate mold. The prologue, while necessary for understanding the development of the Vulture, feels awkwardly disconnected from the rest of the feature because it takes place directly after the Battle of New York in The Avengers. For the most part the Avengers material in the film works, and while I recognize it as a necessity, this material can't help but feel a bit tacked on in the greater scheme of the film.<br/><br/>Overall, however, Homecoming delivers the wall-crawling webslinger's best outing on the silver screen since Spider-Man 2. In the hands of director Jon Watts and Tom Holland, Spider-Man once again becomes a joy to watch in this lighthearted feature that makes the most of its existence. Featuring one of the MCU's best villains in Michael Keaton's Vulture and a strong supporting cast, Homecoming continues 2017's trend of stellar superhero films.<br/><br/>Rating: 8/10 (Great)"

","Like look at tom holland/spiderman in civil war or in infinity war he was so good because the movie had good directors but in this movie they chose a very bad and boring director he was so excited that he got this very big movie so that he tried to put everything into the movie and that what made this movie the worst MCU movie in my opinion.He could have given us the origin story of spiderman and then show us how he joined Civil war and the stuff about the new suit then try to stop the main villain, but he couldn't because he's a bad director"

","I understand that the title is Spider-Man and not Peter Parker. One quality that makes him so great is intelligence. His strength and agility is unique, his ability to think on the fly is even more impressive. <br/><br/>Civil War he came up with the plan to stop Giant man at the airport. In Infinity War he has another great idea. I always believed that Spider-Man could beat Superman because he would come up with the idea to use web based kryptonite and stop him. <br/><br/>This movie did not cover his intelligence. This movie covered the adolescences of his character. I would have preferred he use more of his brain to plan and execute rather than him just jumping and webbing things up. <br/><br/>The suit put more of an emphasis on Stark technology than Peter's creativity. Disappointed they made multiple scenes with Stark rather than one or two. It was like 5 scenes in total I believe. Overkill. <br/><br/>The classmates, I'll keep this brief. With the exception of Ned they all sucked and were TERRIBLE! <br/><br/>CGI and villian (Keaton was great) only reason why I gave a 5 rating. Overall disappointed."
"CountJonnie","7","2","8","26 July 2017"," Great Spider-Man character, decent but not great Spider-Man movie
","Spider-Man deserved a new movie, simply because (a) the previous reboot failed, and because (b) the new Spidey (after Cap. America 3) set a new standard for the cinematical version of the superhero.<br/><br/>In his cameo in Cap. 3 Tom Holland held his own, thanks to gimmicks that tied him to The Avengers and Tony Stark. With respect to the previous movies, the makers made the smart move to NOT make this an origin movie, which would have slowed everything down. Instead they focused on his younger years at school, developing relations with other teens and Stark, and a brand new enemy that steals every scene.<br/><br/>The good part: Tom Holland as Spidey AND as Peter Parker. Other good parts are the action, Michael Keaton as the villain, and Spidey discovering his suit (instead of his powers). The interaction with his school teens, and the impact of his superhero-part on his relations.<br/><br/>The not so good part: by not doing the origin, they gain speed and momentum. That same speed is lost by dragging the clumsy part. Spidey is shown clumsy as a kid learning the responsibility as a hero, but they drag it on like forever. After a while, we get the message. Spidey is a kid, strong enough for more, but not yet mature enough. Great message, now move on.<br/><br/>All in all, a very fun movie, but not as brilliant and charismatic as the original Spider-Man 2. Maybe that movie can't be topped."
"crimsondeathgaming","8","2","8","26 July 2017"," The Best Spider-Man film since, well, since ever!
","Going into the cinema, I was worried that it was going to be another Spider-Man origin story- it pleasantly surprised me- in fact it was more of a film about a young boy who has a crush on a girl and who goes to a high school, but- on the side- he is Spider-Man. Tom Holland takes on the role from Andrew Garfield, who took on the role from Tobey Maguire, neither of whom were particularly believable Spideys, as they were way too old to be a fourteen year old, but Tom Holland is a believable Peter Parker. You could believe that he was a fourteen year old. He tackled the role fantastically- despite his accent being British- he did the American voice very believably. He also did his own stunts something that many of Hollywood's A List actors are too afraid to do in current times. Another fantastic performance was from Zendaya, when I watched the film I presumed that Ned was meant to be the comic relief, but, for me and the other people in the cinema she was, with her quotes on her having no friends, drawing people in misery and how the Washington Monument was built by slaves- this comment is laughed off by her decalathon teacher who looked toward a guard of the monument, who did pull a face which meant ""She is right!"". The guy who brought together the plot was Michael Keaton, some people hailed his performance in this film, whereas I came out of the cinema thinking it was very average- it was not a villain that I would remember like Loki, Red Skull or Ultron. Although I did think that the twist in which Peter went to the door to pick up Liz and the man who answered was Michael Keaton, Liz's father was very good. I liked the touch with Captain America being the PE teacher's back up for a teacher, the PE Teacher made the nice touch of saying that ""I think he is a war criminal"", also the end credit scene got a giggle- I am not sure it was worth the ten minute wait. In reflection, It was a good film, the best Marvel flick since Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 1, it had it's flaws, the fight scenes were too long and there should have been more of Donald Glover, the could've tied him in with the whole of the rest of the MCU- I was disappointed, also I liked Happy in other films- but I found him annoying in this film- he wasn't the usual Happy. Thank you for reading this review. What did you think of Spider-Man Homecoming? That is what I thought- Thank you!"
"balajiashok","7","2","8","11 July 2017"," the movie was super

"ChrisInMiami","7","2","8","7 July 2017"," Fun, worth more than the ticket price, but still waiting for the Homerun
","Great casting with Holland and Keaton, but I honestly wanted more scenes with Keaton. Awesome to see him as a super villain. The villain gets plenty of screen time but a lot of it is the vulture character and Keaton was at his best out of costume. Passable story line. With 12 credited writers, this felt a bit like a patchwork of ideas, some that worked for me and some that didn't. Some of the best scenes were the comedy. Some of the CGI action looked a little jerky to me, in that way that all the other Marvel action looks. Loved that they took the character back to high school. Didn't 'feel' the chemistry between him and the girl so some of that drama fell flat. They could have toned down Parkers 'spaz' moments just a little.<br/><br/>See it."

","The film was great,.... until you get to the part where Stark and Happy could have walked away but noooOooo For some Bizarre reason Pepper Potts shows up. The sequence makes no sense especially since she was written out of Age of Ultron and Civil War. Why is she back? Why is she there? Why is she in the top billing in the graphic credits and on the list and even listed here before all the other principle actors and actresses in the film? Why? Is she an Executive Producer? Why? Had they left her out and had Stark either not open the door (no crowd waiting as they implied) or opened the door (to go address the crowd), it could have been done without Paltrow. I went to the film for two things, RDJ and the Staten Island Ferry sequence. Tom did a great job in Avengers and in this, and his companion character is awesome as well. Keaton did an exceptional job. Why RUIN IT with the sudden appearance of Potts? Why? WHY? Yes go see it, its a great film."

"Santhkanaal","9","2","9","1 September 2017"," Spider-Man: Homecoming better than Spider-Man 2?
","* This review may contain spoilers *<br/><br/>Hey everyone, thanks for reading my Spider-Man: Homecoming Review. So we had Spider-Man,Spider-Man 2,Spider-Man 3,The Amazing Spider- Man,The Amazing Spider-Man 2. And now we have Spider-Man: Homecoming. And of course is the big question did I enjoy it. Like I did with Spider- Man 2. Yes of course is a Marvel movie. Because is the first time that Spider-Man is in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. And watching with IMAX 3D was even better. But unfortunately Sony spoiled in the trailers more than they should. But besides that is a good movie. Before watching this movie I was like please don't be a mess. Because this is the third Spider-Man reboot. What I really like about the movie is that Peter Parker is texting Happy Hogan. And texting when is my next mission. While Happy Hopan never text him back. (Yeah, I know that feeling) Also you see that Peter Parker really trying to impress Tony Stark. He's helping so many people. Although I must say that when I watched the movie they have changed a couple of dialogues. And I think that was really a great idea. Because Sony already spoiled a lot in the trailers. What also is good in this movie is that they don't show a lot of how Peter Parker became Spider-Man. And that's good. But of course in every Superhero movie you have a bad guy. And this time it's Whiplash Bird aka The Vulture. (HAHA) But seriously Michael Keaton did a really as being the bad guy. He's literally The King of the Wings. Because he's Batman, Birdman and now the Vulture. (You either die a hero or live long enough to become the villain) What I also love about the movie is that Tom Holland is a good Peter Parker and Spider-Man. Because you can see him as a fifteen year old boy. Because come on Tobey Maguire as a fifteen year old and Andrew Garlfield. (naaah). This movie also showed that Peter is not kind of handy with his superpowers. That was really funny to see. Jacob Batalon was a really Ned he was keep asking Peter Parker all kind of questions of becoming Spider- Man. And that was hilarious to see. ( I would also do that if I had a friend who is Spider-Man). Don't worry that Spider-Man: Homecoming is Iron Man 4. Because that's not true he only have a big cameo. And it's great to see Iron Man as Peter Parker's mentor. To be honest I remember in 2012: People were saying why is the Avengers not helping Spider-Man. And now in 2017: People were saying like what is Iron Man doing in a Spider- Man Movie. I think it was really great to see Iron Man in this movie. And with upgrades that he gave Peter to his suit it is even more comic accurate. Also this movie had the two Shockers and Vulture what kind of want to have biological wings for vulture. But this suit also great what they have used for the Vulture. But that's not my main point what I wanted is that they really did a great job of adding multiple villains. And Michael Keaton is just one of the best villains what we have seen in a Spider-Man movie. And I think I would enjoy this movie more if there was not so many Spider-Man movies yet. Also there are a lot of Easter eggs of Spider-Man in this movie. I rate this movie a 9. Yeah, Spider-Man is fun again. And I will catch you guys in my next review. <br/><br/>YouTube Video Creator Santhkanaal"
"germeric","8","2","9","26 July 2017"," A welcome surprise.
","I was skeptical about this first, due to the reason that the Amazing Spiderman movies were garbage and the ridiculous amount of long trailers for this movie (which I didn't see, for obvious reasons). Boy was I wrong...<br/><br/>This movie had amazing atmosphere, a perfect mix of high school and superhero ""stuff"". What this movie really aced was Tom Holland's Peter Parker's role, he was so genuine and actually felt like a 15 year old teenager going through high school cringe/awkward bulls*hit. Like having a nerdy friend, crush on a girl, being made of fun, and even prom...<br/><br/>Also I have to praise Ned. A sidekick comical character is always risky in movies, but the risk paid off, he was absolutely stunning whenever he appeared. Hell, even Karen was amazingly hilarious with the Instant Kill mode thing. Do I even have to say anything about Tony Stark? For real, every time he appeared his performance was GOLDEN.<br/><br/>This movie had only 2 flaws, one is the final showdown with the Vulture, which was lacking action so baaaadly and second was the second half of the movie. Unfortunately it kinda lost it's charm, which the first half had.<br/><br/>Definitely a recommend, would watch it again happily!"
"taryllsbaker","8","2","9","11 July 2017"," ""Tom Holland's Spidey is the best yet.""
","Spider-Man: Homecoming is directed by Jon Watts and stars Tom Holland, Michael Keaton, Robert Downey Jr., Marisa Tomei, Jon Favreau, Jacob Batalon, Laura Harrier and Zendaya.<br/><br/>Peter Parker, with the help of his mentor Tony Stark, tries to balance his life as an ordinary high school student in New York City while fighting crime as his superhero alter ego Spider-Man when a new threat emerges. (12A cert; 133 mins)<br/><br/>With this being the third iteration of the friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man, and the first in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), it can be said that the origins are well-known, as is the character. The concept of another reboot was a surprise for many, some liked the idea, others didn't. I was within the latter. That said, with the announcement that Spidey would be joining the MCU, I was curious. Directors Anthony & Joe Russo handled the use of Spider-Man perfectly in Captain America: Civil War. Tom Holland won me over. He became a glowing highlight for me and many others. After that; I was excited to see Spidey in his own movie again.<br/><br/>Finally, after a long year of waiting; we have Jon Watts' Spider-Man: Homecoming. Crossing between ""high school romantic comedy"" and an action-packed adventure, this telling of Spidey's roots is refreshingly fun, albeit a little messy. Instead of introducing Peter Parker all over again, we're thrown right into his world. Peter is struggling to balance his superhero antics with his high school life, but when he discovers a new threat, he begins to hear a calling.<br/><br/>It begins very strongly, setting up the villain and continuing the overarching story from Civil War. But, as Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) mentors Peter, his involvement becomes a tedious distraction. I understand that Peter (Tom Holland) is a kid, but I want to see his evolution into the strong asset that he can be. Every time Spider-Man tries to help, Stark is there to bring him back down. I get it, he's being protective. But, this is supposed to be Spidey's movie. I felt it was a little choppy with its storytelling and wasn't quite sure on its comedic placement. There were times when a serious tone was present, which is exactly what is required to help you connect with the characters, but then it pulls you out with a misplaced joke. That said, there were a couple of serious scenes that were played out very convincingly by Holland and Michael Keaton. Especially within the third act, as Stark's presence seemed to have dissolved quite significantly.<br/><br/>Apart from a few misguided comedic elements, Spider-Man: Homecoming is highly entertaining. Tom Holland is the best Spidey yet, there's no denying. There's a great balance between his life as a student and his Stark ""internship."" He delivers his lines brilliantly both in and out of the suit. Also, his interactions with Jacob Batalon are perfect, they capture 'nerdy youth' in a nutshell. Then comes Michelle (Zendaya), a sassy student who keeps an eye on Peter and his happenings. She becomes a fun addition to the cast and I hope to see her return in the future.<br/><br/>As aforementioned, Keaton delivers his lines very well. The character of Vulture is dark and not be messed with, and this is evident right from the start. There's a clear reason behind his path in life, and it's revealed momentarily. Aunt May (Marisa Tomei), Happy (Jon Favreau) and Liz (Laura Harrier) all appear in smaller roles, but present a likable charm and a comedic element that works splendidly.<br/><br/>The cinematography and editing is smooth and clean, no scenes with jarring issues or a misunderstanding of what's happening on-screen. Everyone in the special and visual effects departments have done a skillful job with the action sequences, it's all very easy to follow and great to look at. Something I was very pleased with was the sound. This film sounds incredible. Any time you see the Vulture coming, you feel the air pulsating and the low frequencies crunching. Truly amazing work by all involved in the sound design.<br/><br/>Michael Giacchino's original score is functioning as it should, with memorable motifs and an energetic funk, but as its own listening experience, it can be a little bland. However, it does support the picture as it should, and becomes a fine component to the overall experience.<br/><br/>Verdict; Though Stark's involvement can be tedious and the comedy a little misused, Spider-Man: Homecoming is still an enjoyable action-packed thrill ride. Tom Holland's Spidey is the best yet.<br/><br/>Spider-Man: Homecoming ‚Äì ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ (7/10)"
"larrymeers","8","5","35","30 July 2017"," A fun and unique Spider-Man movie
","Spider-Man: Homecoming focuses on the story of Peter Parker and how he has many responsibilities. He has to keep his grades up in school, he has to impress Tony Stark if he ever wants to become an avenger, he has to save the city from minor threats since he is spider-man, and he has to deal with a new threat ""The Vulture"". <br/><br/>So i liked how this movie avoids the same story about Peter Parker's Uncle and avenging his death. We have seen this story go on for 5 movies now, and it was refreshing that they didn't even mention it. Tom Holland also does a good job at playing Peter Parker and Spider- Man, he really adds the comedy theme to spider-man's character. Michael Keaton also plays a very well done villain named the Vulture and he does a great job at it as well. It was really cool to see my personal favorite spider-man villain adapted onto the big screen. The action is cool and fun to look at. <br/><br/>A NOTE FOR PEOPLE ABOUT TO WATCH THIS MOVIE! its not a movie completely about our web slinging hero fighting bad guys, its more of a story about the the troubles and responsibilities a teen goes through. And those who have been to High School can relate to this movie like i found myself doing the same thing. So if you take your child to see this movie he/she might be a little bored because they just want to see spider-man fight and do things. <br/><br/>Its not perfect and I'm gonna talk about the flaws i have found in this movie. The original spider-man movies made the action a bit more dramatic and realistic, while this movie just makes it seem like its more for fun then actual realism. I also felt like they could have done a better job with the soundtrack, some musical elements don't really match whats going on in the film. At times the movie can drag a bit but fortunately something funny or action packed happens to boost the movie and keep it on its feet. <br/><br/>So overall, Spider-Man: Homecoming is a very fun and very unique experience. Is it the best spider-man movie? No, but it does standout from the rest as just being a fun and blockbuster popcorn movie. B+ or 8/10"

And, they seemed to make the fight scenes as slapdash as possible since this spideyboy doesn't even know how to fight.<br/><br/>Other problem: this spidey is kind of a goofy teen but when he tells Stark about some guy selling weapons with alien technology to criminals, you would hope that Stark would do something more than ""tell the FBI"". But NOPE. that is all Stark did. Well, I guess in this spidey world, the FBI may be better than the real clowns who became Obama's political operatives and lost all credibility & competence.<br/><br/>btw, most of the 7 pts is for giving RD Jr screen time & using 3 great late-70s/eraly-80s songs."

"YouTubeblack","5","1","3","28 November 2018"," A good peter Parker movie, but is it really a good spiderman movie?
","Well I'm a huge spiderman fan and was eagerly waiting for this movie from MCU.
After watching spiderman trilogy and amazing spiderman movies, I can say that homecoming is an enjoyable peter Parker movie. Its defiantly better than amazing spiderman but is no way near to the 'spiderman 2'
Peter has all this stark tech which kind of overshadow the spiderman elements. The character development of the villain here is most important for a superhero movie, which i think was a bit off here.
Even when i see the train fight sequence from the spiderman 2, it makes me nervous and I care for spiderman, even though i have seen the movie like 10 times. The impact of that sequence shows who spiderman really is.
In spiderman homecoming, people on the ship are actually saved by ironman. I'm not saying its a bad thing. But as a spiderman stand alone film it was just like an introduction of spiderman in the MCU.
In a nut shell, Its an enjoyable movie but not as expected after reading the overrated reviews saying "" it's the best spiderman movie ever """

It kind of brought the whole Marvel Movie Universe full circle for me. Really glad they portray Spidey as a real high school kid, complete with his infamous one liners <3 This movie was done right, and I look forward to seeing this Spider-Man going forward."
"AB_Exosphere","5","1","3","5 September 2018"," Will NEVER be half the legend that The Amazing Spider-Man was.
","This movie was simply Disappointing. The only reason this movie gets praise is because Spidey is finally apart of the MCU. However, there are so many reasons that this is an absolute joke of a film in comparison to it's predecessors. Tom Holland is one of the few good actors in the movie. I like Holland a lot, although he didn't capture the character like Andrew Garfield did he really does look like Peter Parker. That being said his suit looks like anything except Spider-Man. His suit is 100% trash in this film, it looks like it was bought from Party City, also why the actual hell does the suit talk!? Also why is it a girl talking for the suit instead of a dude!? They completely ruined the concept of the suit. Please just give us something identically similar to suits of Tobey Maguire or Andrew Garfield. Their suits actually look like Spidey. Another point I want to make is how inaccurate from the comics and cartoons this film is. <br/><br/>Now, I never got fully into the comics like some have, but I have seen a Spider-Man comic before. One example of this movie being inaccurate is the character ""Flash"". Why is Flash a loser in this film? Flash is supposed to be a theeatening jock, which was done perfectly in The Amazing Spider-Man, but in this film he's just as geeky as Peter. Also, why is MJ called ""Michelle Jones"" instead of Mary Jane Watson? What is the point of all of these stupid and laughable changes? <br/><br/>Finally, this doesn't feel like a Spider-Man movie at all. Tom Holland's character is wasted throughout the film. He's such an amazing actor and instead of making him act like a legitimate Spider-Man, they make him act like a total punk. Holland's portrayal of Spider-Man is ultra strong. Being able to hold together ships as well as stopping the Winter Soldier's punch is just one of the many impressive things his character has pulled so far, but in one seen he somehow gets intimidated by a thug. WTF!? What a way to make Tom Holland look weak. Spider-Man could snap that dude's spine like a toothpick if he wanted to do so. This movie makes no sense. I don't care how many people I piss off in this review, but this is easily one of the worst superhero movies I've seen. Spider-Man 3 is the only movie that's worst than this film. I feel like giving it a 5/10 is being a bit too generous, but I suppose it's possible that it could've been worse. That being said, it was still a pretty bad movie."

+ Peter got messed up by a thug at the school, then he gets beat and frightened after a fight with vulture and has to overcome it. It's probably one of the most real scenes in all of the MCU. Tom Holland nailed it and I hope we see more of that tonal shift. Spider-man is a complex character and he deserves to have those conflicting scenes and Tom really sold that as an actor.
+ End scene with Aunt May
+ MJ. I hope they didn't throw this in as a fake out. Her character seemed more interesting than most others with the small part she has. I was wondering why they kept putting these little shots in the movie of her and her being MJ explains it. Let her put a red tone through her hair in the next movie and it'll be right.<br/><br/>I give it a 7 out of 10 because of the boring generic MCU nonsense but redeems itself for most of the last half. I hope they pay more attention on Peter instead of other MCU heroes next time around and they do something interesting with scorpion."

","I went to see this one at the movies with my son.
It was ok, watchable, but definitely one of Marvel's weaker efforts. A bit lame at times, and nothing new really added. The main actor is likeable and did a good job with the script he was given. Which was a little less intense and maybe directed at a younger age group than previous efforts. 
My 8 year old son liked the movie but did not rate it as highly as some of the other Marvel movies, he was slightly disappointed with it.
I recommend you give it a go, something to watch at home on a rainy day."

","'Spider-Man: Homecoming' is everything a Spider-Man film should be. In the past, there have been numerous attempts at a Spider-Man film franchise, and while those may have been good, they are ultimately out shined by the new addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. By including Spider-Man in the universe of other superheroes, this results in the film having more depth and complexity. Like every Superhero film, the plot was rather predictable and held minimal surprises, but it was still thoroughly entertaining, fresh and original. The casting for this movie was fantastic, with Tom Holland being the best Spider-Man in cinematic history. Sorry, not sorry Tobey Maguire. Not only did he look the age that Peter Parker should be, but he really brought the character to life and was the main reason I enjoyed the movie. It was also great to see a change in Peter Parker's love interest and I was impressed that the filmmakers moved away from the same old Mary-Jane and Gwen Stacey plot line. This helped make the film feel fresh and original. The fight scenes in this movie were aided by brilliant visual effects and resulted in being quite impressive. Overall, this movie was a successful addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe with a fresh (yet predictable) plot and a fantastic lead actor."

","The Marvel Cinematic Universe has become a tightly orchestrated, intertwined, time line of films, where viewers need to watch all the parts in order to follow the overall story line, which is possible because Marvel Studios control is.
Spider-Man is controlled by Sony; they pay for 100% of his films and take the box office receipts, which makes including him in his own film as part of the greater story arcs a tricky proposition.<br/><br/>Maybe that's why this film feels more like an Iron Man film at times. Unlike previous Peter Parker films, there's no Uncle Ben and having his life defined by that death, or need to show him getting bitten and developing his native powers, but it's rather how he fits into the greater MCU - as though you haven't seen an MCU film before - as part of Tony Starks ""intern scheme"", and introducing extra parts to the neighbourhood Spider-Man that feel gimmicky. This results in Jon Favreau as Tonys body guard Happy getting more screen time than Peters love interest Liz (Laura Harrier).<br/><br/>It gets the quirky, angst ridden Peter. The nerdy Peter who builds Lego with his best mate, the star of the general knowledge team. Whose never been on a plane and sneaks around behind his Aunts clueless back. 
Tom Holland plays the role with humour and rage, fluctuating between the naivety of a young man finding his powers and confidence of a superhero willing to put his life on the line for society. Alongside him, Jacob Batalon as Ned, likewise has the juvenile questions about what can Spider-Man do (how far do the web slingers fire?), while being Peters ""guy in the chair"", tech savvy associate; seemingly able to emulate Tony Starkesque computer skills.<br/><br/>Yet at times the scale of the action seems wrong. Going from stopping local hoodlums on bikes, to dealing with weaponry that nearly destroyed New York and took the whole team of Avengers to stop. 
The weapons developer - Phineas Mason / The Tinkerer (Michael Chernus) would have made for a good Agents of SHIELD enemy; coming up with various weapons to take on the old government agency. Following the Sokovia Accords
(mentioned in the film), who would stop him?
Michael Keaton makes for a good bad guy; he has the motivation and opportunity to create the situations for Spidey to combat, without being so psychotic as to completely take over Peters life. Like many teen based films, he could be a person that a teen might have to overcome in their everyday life, but being a superhero, they have the ability to actually kick their ass rather than having to verbalize the conflict. That works.<br/><br/>What doesn't work for me are the shortcuts and scale that joins the set pieces up. He doesn't need the Iron Man gimmicks to be the neighbourhood Spider Man."

The main villain is Adrian Toomes, known as The Vulture, who is entirely different than his portrayal in the animated series, as a bio-mechanical engineer and arms trafficker. Michael Keaton plays his third winged character in his career and does a terrific job as the Vulture! Robert Downey Jr. also makes an appearence as Peter's mentor, Tony Stark as well as Jon Favreau's Happy Hogan to the extension of a comic relief.<br/><br/>Modern day society and social issues are heavily infused in the development of the characters, but ultimately it was about Peter Parker and his growth into a superhero by learning and feeling how it is to be respected and how it is to be despised.<br/><br/>""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" is a fun movie that follows the great Marvel superhero formula and is a great addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe."

Mostly I thought Michael Keaton did a great job. He played the part very well. Also, enough cannot be said about how they were able to take a character as lame as Vulture (seriously, is there a weaker repeat character in Spider-man's rogues gallery?) and make him ominous. The character had hat tips to the comic book character (flight suit collar looking sort of like the comic book Vulture's nonsense around his neck) without drawing too much from it -- which is a good thing, since comic book Vulture is lame. Shocker was in it... albeit in a secondary capacity. They also gave a nod to the comic book uniform for him, again without drawing too much from the on- page character."

"ultroks","6","1","3","6 October 2017"," Not the Spiderman we all grow up with.
","They are trying to make their adaptation of Spiderman much different from all previous ones by skipping origin and changing character traits and personalities. The problem is that they changed some core elements of them, especially Peter Parker who is nothing like one we all know and love from comics. They dumb him down and adjusted too much to be appealing for today's younger generations. Most of the times, he is just too immature and childish, even for a 15 years old kid, totally ignoring fact that he should be genius and outcast.<br/><br/>
Story have some good ideas here and there, They add at least some responsability elements to the character so its not completely shallow. Its trying to be mix of comedy and action but often ends being just too cheesy and naive .
Beggining of third act is the highest point of the movie where they turn the table and finally build needed tension. There is that one dialouge driven scene in the car after the ''great'' revalation that slow down the tone and set the climax of the movie perfectly. Sadly the following was returned to first gear again rushed thru final comfortation and conclusion, without delieviring the
fulfiling end.<br/><br/>I expected better character development and little more focus on main villain. Which is disappointing because they really waste good potential with Keaton as Vulture, he nailed the role. Other than him, there was Shocker, two of them actually, the first one was fine but second was just uninspiring and bland.<br/><br/>Acting was good, Tom Holand is good actor and fine for the role, fit more than Andrew or Tobey.
Action is decent, but not even close to the Civil War nor last Spiderman movie (Amazing Spider-man 2)<br/><br/>Direction is where it really fails. Like most others Disney/Marvel movies its too fast phased, They jump from scene to scene, and location to location too fast, Not giving enough time of scenes and acts.<br/><br/>
It shows that movie is trying to be original and unique, it have same good moments and most important they didn't completely miss the whole point of Spiderman. So its not that bad, kids and young ones will love this movie. 6.3/10"
"hellsnavy16","8","1","3","30 September 2017"," Welcome Peter Parker, for the first time - to the big screen
","i have spent hours and hours in years past - probably hundreds, reading and re-reading the comic books of the 1980s, the golden age of marvel comics, and the golden age of spider man. Spiderman is indeed the greatest superhero of marvel comics, possibly the greatest superhero ever created. he's a proxy for the audience, a way to make a hero relatable - his life has very pronounced ups and downs, and when it's time to show courage he has it in spades. he's both awkward, but can be funny. he is insecure, more human than other superheros. this movie version delivers on the spirit of the best run of comics books. the movie includes some of the greatest moments from the comic book such as peter overcoming his helplessness and gathering all of his strength. you can tell marvel did not reboot the character just to make a buck, they took great care to craft a good story, it has the signature marvel humor which is always nice, Jon favreau is good in it, while Robert Downy Jr. makes one of his best appearances as tony stark in a sort of father figure for peter and it is quite nice. Marisa tomei makes a surprisingly great, uncharacteristically sexy aunt may. which worked very well. peter's love interest is stupidly gorgeous and she kept me enthralled whenever she was on screen. peter's sidekick is also great, and the casting for peter was quite good, he nailed peter's personality overall. the villain was very charismatic and a great performance by Michael Keaton who was recently nominated for an academy award. in fact the whole cast of actors is just perfect. the only reason i am not giving this movie better score than an eight is because i think they can really kick this into overdrive with a sequel, if they don't rush to make a trilogy. there's some social commentary that i thought it was a bit much. other than that - amazing movie, must watch."

"DarthVoorhees","7","1","3","22 August 2017"," It has a lot going for it but the MCU fan service holds it back
","I really liked 'Spider-Man Homecoming'. For a genre that really is afraid to try new things I thought 'Spider-Man Homecoming' offered a fresh take on a character that seemed to offer no new surprises. It isn't a movie that will break dramatic new ground but it has the capability to make you smile and at the very least it is a different approach to the character of Peter Parker who desperately needed one. The key to the success here is that 'Spider-Man' has fun. It's funny and light and doesn't dissect the nature of heroism. I can't begin to tell you how much of a vast improvement on the Nolan-esqe Garfield films and the 9/11 residue on the Raimi films. I want to offer a high recommendation but the film still has the traps of a MCU film. The cast sells it as Spider-Man really does swing to new heights until he crashes into the MCU fan service. <br/><br/>Holland is probably the most effective Peter Parker as he has an identity outside of being Spider-Man. We actually believe he is struggling with adolescence because he doesn't over punctuate everything with angst. I really liked the female characters too. Laura Harrier and Zendaya are both very funny and have personality outside of being Peter's object of affection and something for Spider-Man to save. Holland also doesn't come across as a Norman Bates stalker in his interaction with them like Garfield and Maguire did. <br/><br/>Keaton is also pretty awesome as he is in everything. The character is a lot more fleshed out than a lot of the Marvel villains. He's angry but his backstory actually is kind of clever and is a nice mirror to the story of Spider-Man in that they are both blue collar heroes and villains. I wish he and Tony Stark shared a scene together because it would be interesting to see this type of villain interact with Robert Downey Jr's loud obnoxious characterization of Tony Stark.<br/><br/>The Marvel fan service is what kills this movie. Robert Downey Jr is phoning it in for a paycheck in the most obvious fashion possible. This movie could have easily have worked without the presence of the overt Marvel reminders. Holland's characterization deserved this."
"henryluck","8","1","3","15 August 2017"," Spider Man: Homecoming Review
","Spider Man: Homecoming is exactly the reboot Spider Man fans have wanted since the end of the Sam Raimi trilogy. Though it doesn't quite reach the same heights as the original trilogy, it's still way better then the previous abysmal Amazing Spider Man films and a must see for any Marvel and Spider Man fan.<br/><br/>The story takes place 2 months after the events of 2016's Captain America: Civil War. Peter Parker who's this time played by Tom Holland, has recently came across thugs wielding powerful alien technology that was extracted by the Chitauri who are the aliens the Avengers fought in The Avengers (2012). It turns out the bad guy behind all this is Adrian Toomes (aka: Vulture) who needs the technology in order to get money to support his family, including for his daughter Liz who inconveniently Peter has a crush on. Therefore it's up to Spider Man and a little help from Robert Downey Jr's Iron Man to stop him. This plot is as predictable as it sounds which does take away from the peril of the film and it doesn't help that an ""Untitled Spider-Man: Homecoming Sequel"" has been listed on IMDb. Another thing that doesn't help is that Peter is shown getting the Stark-made Spidey suit taken away from him from Tony Stark (who gave him the suit) for failing to listen to him about not going after Vulture in the trailer and that's exactly what happens in the film, so you do know what's going to happen. But nowadays it's not the plot that gets people excited for Marvel movies, it's the action which this film delivers on.<br/><br/>The fight scenes with the Chitauri technology and Vulture felt fast and tense. The fight scene of the Ferry for example just over halfway through the film was very well shot and kept me invested in the scene because it wasn't just noise. The film also made great use of Spider Man's new abilities thanks to the Stark-made suit such as the taser and ricochet webs which were just as fun as they sounded. <br/><br/>But the main thing that kept me invested in this film, was Tom Holland's character of Peter Parker because he absolutely excelled at the character. His character had such an optimist exciting view of the world but he's also a kind hearted and respectful person who cares deeply for the people around him. Even though he is coming of age and quite naive, he's still a very likable and relatable Spider Man very similar to Tobey Maquire's. Vulture's character was also very well made as you can understand his motivations and he an intimidating villain when he's in the Vulture gear, similar to the Green Goblin from the first Spider Man film in San Raimi's Spider Man trilogy. Tony Stark's character was also very well played as usual, being the likable unlikeable character that everyone loves him for, but he's also an excellent mentor for Peter almost being his father in certain ways.<br/><br/>But what I found most fitting in this film is that Marvel updated the classic 60's Spider Man theme for the opening Marvel logo, likely showing a new leaf after the distasteful Amazing Spider Man movies. It turns out after I watched this film, my prediction was absolutely true."
"tdub154420","6","1","3","23 July 2017"," It's got charm, wit and style - just missing heart.
","In Spider-Man's fifth appearance on the big screen they chose a very different approach for his character and it pays off greatly. Peter Parker is a humble teenager who just can't wait to be a superhero. His conflict is that he has been deemed by his hero and mentor,r Iron Man, as merely a ""superhero in training"". Taking influences from John Hughes movies of the past, Marvel tells a teen movie as best they can. The only issue is that it is too ""super"" to truly embody the spirit of John Hughes films. Director/writer John Hughes films succeeded because he so well understood the ethos of adolescence, from teenage insecurity to high school hopes and ambitions, John Hughes had an innate sense of how teenagers ticked and how to make his teenage characters emotionally relatable. Its hard to tell a story that is emotionally relatable when its about a teenage boy who has been recruited for something so great. It may be relatable to the likes of Lebron James, who couldn't wait to be drafted to the NBA out of high school, but for most audience members Spider-Man's conflict could come off as less-relatable - or at least less emotionally significant. And therein lies the biggest issue with this movie: it seems to lack heart. Spider-Man is driven by wanting to be taken seriously, by wanting to be a real superhero. In climatic moments his emotional motivation is just to not let down his hero Tony Stark - rather than being driven by any deeper personal commitments to loved ones or any intimate personal reasons. Its a main plot that does drive character development, but its so lightweight of an emotional anchor it seems like it would work better as a subplot. In some ways this is a nice change of pace for a superhero movie, but there are some scenes in which the film tries desperately to drum up emotion and hearken to the heart of the film, and its these scenes that just feel empty and shallow. But for the rest of the film its light on its feet. It is charming and Tom Holland and his supporting cast of teenage friends are a joy to watch. My only hope is that going forward they are able to find a deeper, more relatable emotional heart for Spider-Man's story."
"jackson-regurge","8","1","3","22 July 2017"," Marvel at Spider-man!
","Spider-man: Homecoming is an excellent addition to the Marvel cinematic universe. Ever since the Avengers arrived back in 2012, I have dreamed of Spider-man being part of the MCU. Five years later, it seems my wish has been granted in the form of a fun and light- hearted superhero flick. <br/><br/>I wasn't sure how Marvel would go about reinventing a new Spider-man as it felt like most of the tricks had already been pulled. However, the studio didn't disappoint and modernised every element successfully for a new audience. <br/><br/>Tom Holland absolutely shines as Spider-man. Holland has great timing and really brings the character alive. Marvel has now found the perfect actor to take on the iconic role. Michael Keaton is also very impressive once again donning wings but this time as the compelling antagonist known as The Vulture. Time and time again, Keaton gives great performances. Jacob Batalon's performance as Ned adds a great comedic depth to the film and provides the audience with some of the best laughs throughout. <br/><br/>I really liked the direction that Jon Watts and the Marvel executives took with this film. Every decision made sense. It was really great to see such an accurate depiction of Spider-man on the big screen. I like how Tony Stark fills the role of Uncle Ben √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú I initially thought that there would be a lot of Iron Man in Homecoming, but I think there was just the right amount as after all this is a Spider-man film.<br/><br/>The film's story is very strong and the problems that Peter Parker faces are very relatable. There is also a great twist in the movie which caught me completely by surprise and adds a lot to the film. <br/><br/>Overall, I would give the film 8 out of 10 because it delivers on all of my wishes for the character and progression/evolution of the franchise."
"svorva","7","1","3","21 July 2017"," A Smaller Superhero
","Spider-Man: Homecoming is further evidence that the superhero genre is completely out of gas. Simultaneously, this new Spiderman with his high school shenanigans arguably makes the best laughs and action summer movie of the year. Maintaining these two opinions is not an attempt at contrarianism, rather optimism. I hope this take on Spiderman is an omen of better films to come.<br/><br/>To clarify, when I say ""out of gas"" I am not commentating on the reboot status. Business is business. Movie rights for Spider Man have been a drama in and of itself. That's not the problem. I'm commentating on the genre: origin stories, high stakes, and humor adjacent to dour edge. The hallowed Marvel cinematic universe is tired. So even though this Spiderman is closer to a spider boy, his role in this world is beyond approach. After all, Thor is in the Marvel universe. Ant Man is in the Marvel universe. A ham sandwich is overqualified as a member of the Marvel universe. Past iterations of the coming of age hero portrayed the character as full of anger and angst. I will have to consult my resident comic book guy, but Homecoming's Peter Parker seemingly returns to the source material. A struggling teenager who combats inadequacy with cheek and a bit of sulk. A character we have all seen before, but maybe less familiar in the guise of a superhero.<br/><br/>Spiderman is a teenager movie first and a superhero second. The Earth threatening consequences take back seat as to whether if Peter Parker can survive high school and ask his crush to the dance. A story of a teen superhero trying to function while fighting crime only to come back home and look himself up on YouTube. Kick A$$ tried this 7 years ago, but that's ancient history. More importantly while Kick A$$ desperately tried to be dark and subversive, Homecoming is just a film content with its place in the universe. Literally. Spiderman can rely on his Avenger brothers to define what it is to be a superhero focusing on doughy best friend fanboy and the rest of the decathlon team. Ironman is shanghaied into role of father figure with the protagonist son who feels underestimated. Captain America is the Boy Scout leader with no helpful advice for those of us living in the real world. Sucked into Homecoming's vortex, in this new reference frame heavy hitting hero reemerge as square authority figures.<br/><br/>In Homecoming, there is not time to waste on origin stories or even Uncle Ben. Peter Parker/Spiderman (Holland) has already battled Captain America in the events of the Winter Soldier. Now Peter finds himself largely abandoned by the Avengers, with only Tony Stark encouraging him to be a friendly neighborhood Spiderman. This leaves Peter helping old ladies and battling bicycle thieves with middling results. Peter feels under-appreciated on the job but overwhelmed at school. Hopelessly infatuated with senior Liz and relentlessly bullied by preppy Flash, he is the superhero at the bottom of every totem pole. Overwhelmed, but still full of grand ambitions, equally nerdy best friend Ned is his only ally. So when the villain Vulture (Michael ""Birdman"" Keaton) swoops into the story it is Pete's chance at deliverance or total destruction. Is Spiderman a superhero or just boy Icarus who flew a bit too close to the sun? Vulture/Adrian Toomes/Michal Keaton is kinda perfect. Toomes is in charge of a salvage crew cleaning up the mess left behind by the Avengers. This is a break of a lifetime for his company and family, but this dream is swept away when cronies of Stark Industries lay claim to all salvaging operations. Ruined, the team criminally off scraps of alien technology and the Vulture is born. Toomes is a working class hero. And after watching three Iron Man movies, I cannot help but root for Toomes' revenge against arrogant billionaire weapons dealer Stark. Keaton is all charm, a reminder that one nice thing about big budgets is that they attract top talent. But remember, this is still a high school movie, so in an epic twist we discover Toomes has an additional identity and it is so perfect all I could do was applaud.<br/><br/>Holland (spidey) is a neophyte compared to veteran Keaton, but he carries the movie as the protagonist and deserves the corresponding praise. He has this cracking voice that is maddening yet perfect for the role. When a criminal calls him a girl it is not an elementary school insult, but a joke about the performance. I have never laughed more in any superhero movie. There is of course the usual quirky bunch of students, but they are so lovable here. Mr. Harrington, decathlon coach, me in hysterics. Perfect amount of superhero cameos. Homecoming had the entire theater in a laugh riot. Only the over reliance of teenage movie tropes really held Spiderman back from greatness. Of course the girl is going to go to the dance. They never don't end up going to the dance. This idealized high school myth. I know I am a curmudgeon who hated his formative years, but this is just saccharine. After one (admittedly sublime) twist the pieces have all been set and there is only one way the game can play out. The climax has high altitude action, but does not really thrill. Not flawless, or totality original, but a step forward after years of stasis, Spiderman: Homecoming convinced me that superhero movies are not a lost cause. Ball in your court Marvel."

Peter Parker, the template for high school awkwardness attempts to go from child to adulthood without concerning himself with the trials and tribulations that go along with this process. The movie itself is a bit refreshing in that we have an antagonist that most of us can relate to...an antagonist that would get ripped apart by Hulk or Thor, but can more than hold his own going toe to toe with the young ""web head"" who attempts to thwart his every nefarious move. <br/><br/>You will certainly receive the ""Marvel Treatment"" here...albeit in a more subdued manner, and smaller scale than you may be used to. Decent story, and a kid who is just having an absolute blast playing your friendly neighborhood Spiderman...he's having fun, and we're having fun watching him do so. Michael Keaton does a great job of playing an ""everyman"" villain, the perfect match for our newest Avenger in training. <br/><br/>I took my 11 and 9 year old sons to see this movie predicated on its reviews, many of which indicated that it was kid friendly. For the most part it was, but references to porn, and a partial ""F"" bomb at the end of the movie was a bit disheartening...So in my opinion its operates somewhere midway within its PG-13 rating.<br/><br/>In summary a fun movie that doesn't get bogged down by trying to explain it's origin...All of us already know he got bit by a radioactive spider...why waste half of a movie regurgitating said narrative?<br/><br/>Big fun, which continues to set up our war torn heroes for their ultimate battle against that all powerful Titan; Thanos."

","We all know that Spider-Man's silver screen legacy is extremely controversial. With three incarnations of the character existing in the short span of 15 years, it's impossible not to compare every reboot to the last. How does this one compare? It's a decent effort, but Homecoming isn't as deep or as personal as Spidey's past exploits, largely because of its ties to the great Marvel machine.<br/><br/>In the shadow of the other two iterations of Spider-Man, this film makes a sincere attempt to directly address fan issues with prior films. The central fan criticism of 2012's The Amazing Spider-Man is that it spends too much time retelling Spider-Man's backstory. This film subverts that by not showing the backstory at all. Likewise, another common criticism of the first two iterations of the character was the unrealistic age of the lead actors (Maguire was a 27 year old playing a high school student). Homecoming fixes this by casting a boyish-looking 21 year old Tom Holland. The film shies away from retread villains, having Spidey fight Vulture instead of round 3 against the Green Goblin. The film also subverts wider criticisms of the MCU by having Spidey's role be to stop a simple heist by an arms dealer, instead of having another movie in which the total annihilation of Earth is threatened. Fans will be happy that the film addresses all of these common criticisms and ""fixes"" them, but that alone doesn't mean that this is the perfect Spider-Man movie.<br/><br/>Perhaps the movie's biggest flaw is its annoying obsession with The Avengers. The film literally has about *fifty* allusions to other Marvel characters. Peter Parker talks about how he's dying to get into the Avengers, other characters ask if he knows the Avengers, the villains express their fear of Iron Man, etc. This movie cannot do its own thing for five minutes without bringing up other Marvel properties. Cameos by Captain America and random references to Thor's belt are distracting to the story that this movie is trying to tell. The more cynical viewers in the audience can easily identify these references for what they are: cross-promotion. The whole charade is just a thinly veiled commercial for the next Marvel movie.<br/><br/>Spider-Man: Homecoming also suffers from its presence in the MCU in more ways than just the references. In the logic of Marvel's current universe, superheroes are totally normalized. Every character in the film knows about the Avengers and their battles against alien invaders, so the emergence of a new hero is not mind-blowing to anyone. Since a common New Yorker knows about Iron Man, they don't really care about Spider-Man. The people of New York are very invested in Spider-Man in the Raimi trilogy: they rally behind him as an emblem of their city's identity. He is featured on the front page of the newspaper every day in those films. In Homecoming, the people don't care that much about Spider-Man, and that makes the audience disengaged too. The proliferation of superpowers and superweapons in the universe also makes Spider-Man pretty pedestrian in terms of how well he can fight. In the other films, it is very satisfying to see Spidey easily take down common. In Homecoming, the viewer never gets a good moment in which we are in awe of Peter's powers. He's just shown as a guy who's less powerful than Iron Man, and that really gives audiences a reason to be disengaged.<br/><br/>Spider-Man's motivations in this film are much weaker than those in the traditional Spider-Man story. In Homecoming, Spider-Man wants to impress Tony Stark so he can join the Avengers. Contrast this to the traditional Spider-Man mythos, in which Spider-Man has made a vow to avenge the memory of his dead Uncle, whose death he feels partially responsible for. Spidey has to fight for good because it's his duty and there's nobody else to do it, even when his personal life crumbles and it's easy to quit. This poetic struggle is almost entirely absent from Homecoming, and it is the backbone of the character.<br/><br/>Despite my gripes, this film certainly does have its fair share of redeeming qualities. It is a comedy through and through, keeping a constant stream of laughs that land more often than not. The script is filled with witty jokes and the acting and editing makes these jokes work nicely. Making this movie a comedy-first was a calculated choice by Marvel so it would be more likable and different from other MCU films (think Ant-Man), and that choice pays off since the comedy beats work well.<br/><br/>Tom Holland is a very good casting choice for the role of Spider-Man, hitting the comedic and dramatic notes well while realistically looking like a high school student. A lot of weight and scrutiny is put on the actors who play Spider-Man (probably since they are easily compared to others who have played the same character), and Holland delivers. He embodies the character's charm and youthfulness well and isn't awkwardly old. He may be the most believable and relatable Spider-Man yet.<br/><br/>Michael Keaton's villain, Vulture, is another highlight of the film. He is a man with a blue collar background who is just trying to get by, a struggle that the audience can identify with easily. There is some serious irony that Keaton is playing this ""Birdman""-esque character, but he certainly plays it well.<br/><br/>In itself, Spider-Man: Homecoming is a good enough, par-for-the-course Marvel movie. Sadly, the character has had incredible recent exploits, and this film doesn't get to the same heights of those movies. It's sad to see Spidey in a movie that just makes him another face in the already overcrowded MCU when the character seems so much more special than that."
"rogerdarlington","Null","1","3","20 July 2017"," A very satisfying addition to the canon.
","After three ""Spider-Man"" movies directed by Sam Raimi with Tobey Maguire in the eponymous role and two ""Amazing Spider-Man"" films helmed by Marc Web with (British) Andrew Garfield as the titular super-hero, we have a sixth cinematic outing for the arachnid in a mere 15 years. This time the director is little-known Jon Watts and Peter Parker is played by another British actor, Tom Holland who made a cameo appearance in this role in ""Captain America: Civil War"". Essentially this is a stand-alone contribution to Marvel's Cinematic Universe, although there are short appearances by Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) and an all-too-brief look-in by Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow).<br/><br/>So, what's new? Well, for once Parker - who is presented as a 15 year old a high school student - is represented by a genuinely young thespian (although Holland is 21) and we have the youngest Aunt May yet (an underused Marisa Tomei). Also we have a new sidekick for Peter, Ned (Jacob Batalon), and an interesting new villain called Vulture (a smart Michael Keaton). Of course, any super-hero movie depends on effective special effects, which are certainly om show here, and exciting action sequences, which are on offer with histrionics at the top of the Washington Monument and on board a Staten Island ferry. So, all in all, a very satisfying addition to the canon."
"mariotasic1994","9","1","3","20 July 2017"," A pleasant surprise!
","I wasn't sure about this movie because frankly, Doctor Strange and the Ant-man disappointed me. And I thought that Marvel had lost it's touch. And the fact that I don't like Spider-man as a character doesn't help. I went with a friend to see this movie and after the first 5 minutes I was hooked. It was fun but also serious and relatable. In fact, what I liked the most was that this movie was not afraid of some emotional depth. Sure, it's fun and entertaining to watch Tom as Spider-man, swinging around and making jokes. But when it comes to depth and character growth - they nail it. I'm glad Downey wasn't the main focus. He was there as a connection to the other movies and as a mentor. No more. no less. <br/><br/>Minor spoilers!!! <br/><br/>The scenes between Holland and Keaton (In the car) are superb. Very tense, very interesting. And I am SO glad no one decided to throw in a stupid joke in all that. It gave those scenes even more depth and importance. And that is something Marvel needs more. Don't get me wrong. Marvel is great. But it seems they are afraid of emotions and seriousness in some scenes. And it shows - think 'Doctor Strange with the cape in front of the mirror' scene.<br/><br/>For me this is the best Marvel movie since Winter Soldier. It's not perfect - no movie is, but it is a step up from the previous ones."
"leemesser-66656","9","1","3","18 July 2017"," New Spin on Spider-Man and I Like It!
","***Has some Spoilers***<br/><br/>It was spectacular, just like the old, well not that old, television show The Spectacular Spider-Man that aired in 2008. When the movie opens with Peter Parker (Tom Holland) recording, with his phone, his drive with Tony Stark ( Robert Downey Jr.) the audience is already intrigued by the change in the cinematic style from what they are accustomed to. The film was very well put together, especially with the meshing of the rest of the Marvel Universe. The director Jon Watts did a great job of putting a new spin on Spider-Man, having Peter Parker in high-school and doing an internship√Ç¬†with Stark Enterprises. Peter was always seen as a nerd but more like a social outcast and very serious. This movie changes that, well Peter Parker is still a nerdy outcast, but he is less serious and more comedic. There was always the question of 'Will Spider-Man ever be part of the Avengers?' And this movie answered that question, of course i'm not going to spoil anything. Overall I was very impressed and enjoyed this film very much so, especially over the previous Spider- Man productions."
"targe1314","4","6","47","31 July 2017"," A mediocre addition to an already bloated superhero catelogue
","What has Marvel done to Spiderman?<br/><br/>I'm of the opinion that once a movie has 'topped', in short, realized it's full potential, achieved all the glory you may have imagined it, from reading the books or watching the much crapp-ier versions, I'm done, I'm OUT. I won't watch again.<br/><br/>This is, of course, very problematic for the movie money generating machine, which must continuously pump out the tried-and-true tropes and stories that always gen cash.<br/><br/>Apparently one of those is poor Spiderman, who has gone from the initial high of Tobey Maguier's near perfect rendition, backed by a solid Goblin from Willem Dafoe, to this... half melted slushy on a 711 floor, with Michael Keaton (!) as the really boring lame villain, Aunt May is a drop dead gorgeous ailf, and Mary Jane is non-existent as a love interest. Uncle Ben is gone. Tony Stark provides and taketh aways all the toys. No back story is explained. No radioactive spider is explained. Peter needs his own goo-spitters.<br/><br/>I was dragged into this by my 17 yo daughter, who liked it, and that's who this is written for. But ONLY this time. NO parents will enjoy, as opposed to the first time out.<br/><br/>This is by far the worst spiderman movie since the first of the 'new orginals' blew us all out of the water."
"Eric266","8","2","10","28 July 2017"," Good Movie, But Needed a Stronger Director
","I was fascinated by the McGuire Spider-man and a bit lukewarm on Garfield's version. Tom Holland did a great job in his short cameo in Civil War. I was expecting a lot.<br/><br/>This version falls somewhere below Spider-man 2 and just slightly ahead of Spider-man. The less said about Amazing Spider-man, probably the better. <br/><br/>First the bad. As others have mentioned, the high tech suit really dragged the movie down, IMO. All the various webbings and the A.I. personality made it feel like Iron Man Light, rather than a Spider- man movie. Peter is a genius and made all his own weapons. Having Stark provide them robbed the character of some of that intelligence and depth. Spidey is a down-to-earth hero and looks over his neighborhood as its guardian angel. This plot got just a bit too high tech and airborne for my tastes. The climatic fight scene was poorly filmed. I could not tell what was happening as the characters all seemed to flow together in a CGI soup that made it hard to distinguish what was happening. Reminded me of the fight scenes in a Transformer movie. It was just lights, colors, and movement on screen. My biggest pet peeve with this movie (as with the other versions) is how Peter reveals his identity to seemingly everyone he meets. Peter is a loner and struggles with the infamy of being Spider-man (he is libeled in the comics by J. Jonah Jameson on a daily basis) without being able to share his identity or bask in the glory with anyone. It was central to his character and all three versions of the character have blown that up by having just about every character know his identity. Again, it makes him Iron Man Light in this respect.<br/><br/>The good. I REALLY liked Holland's portrayal of Peter. I think he embodies the character better than McGuire or Garfield. He's awkward, innocent, and has a wide-eyed view of the world. His ""interrogation"" of Donald Glover's character is probably one of the high points of all these movies. It was funny, well-acted, and provided depth to Peter/Spider-man. Thankfully, we didn't get another origin story. We join Spider-man ""already in progress"" so to speak. I was okay with the absence of some of the iconic characters from Peter's high school years like Gwen, Harry, and Uncle Ben. If I were Peter, I would have put down the Ned character almost immediately. He was annoying as a character and also a liability for someone with a secret identity. I loved Toomes/Vulture being a middle aged man as opposed to an old geezer like he is in the comics. Keaton was phenomenal in the role as a character who wasn't necessarily evil, but circumstances pushed him the wrong way. He was multi-layered and relatable. Tomei's Aunt May was a nice update as well. I never understood why Aunt May was so old in the comics, so making her younger actually made more sense to me. She's his aunt, not his grandmother. <br/><br/>The script could have been a bit tighter and the plot was underwhelming. I think less Stark would have been an improvement. Ironically, the points in the plot where Stark/Iron Man SHOULD have shown up, he doesn't. Other times he just shows up and doesn't advance the plot. <br/><br/>I enjoyed the film, but felt there were more misses than there should have been. While quite an improvement over Amazing Spider- man, it has a long way to go before it can surpass Spider-man 2."
"MrDHWong","8","2","10","6 July 2017"," Captures the lighthearted spirit of the titular hero while also keeping it closely in line with the other recent Marvel films
","Spider-Man: Homecoming is the second reboot of the Spider-Man franchise and the fourth film of Phase 3 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Starring Tom Holland in the eponymous role, this film captures the lighthearted spirit of the titular hero while also keeping it closely in line with the other recent Marvel films.<br/><br/>Eight months after the events of Captain America: Civil War, Peter Parker/Spider-Man (Tom Holland) is still attending high school while living with his Aunt May (Marisa Tomei). Using the specially designed suit given to him by Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), Peter continues to fight crime in his local neighbourhood in Queens, New York while juggling his school life. One day, Peter uncovers an illegal weapons plot led by Adrian Toomes/Vulture (Michael Keaton), and despite being warned not to get too involved in major affairs, decides to step in and stop Toomes before it's too late.<br/><br/>Filled with all the fun and excitement one can expect from a Spider-Man film, and indeed, a Marvel film in general, Spider-Man: Homecoming is a fast-paced ride from start to finish. I especially enjoyed how despite being primarily a collaboration with Sony, the film still felt very much like the Disney-owned Marvel properties. Tom Holland is young and witty in the lead role, as was previously seen in Civil War, however this time he isn't merely reduced to a scene-stealing supporting role. Michael Keaton, as to be expected, gives a convincing performance in the villainous role of Vulture, this being the third winged character he's played in his career (after Batman and Birdman of course), and thankfully isn't forgettable. As is the case with most Marvel films, be sure to stay back for a post-credits scene, because this one in particular I found hilarious.<br/><br/>I rate it 8/10"
"NusnakSpilkes","5","2","11","26 October 2017"," Good story but ruined by offensive, PC, racist, Left Wing smear
","POINT1: Apart from reeking from Left Wing stench and poison, this was a good ol' yarn. Purposefully aimed at the brainwashed Millennial/Gen Y members of our PC-crippled society. There's the obligatory black, Asian, African, and other non-white cast members, not that I have problem with other races - but when you ram that down our throats as an over-compensating suck up to the PC-abiding, Left Wing passive-aggressive racists then that is TOO much... and I am OUT! <br/><br/>And as a special mention: of course the bad guy is a ....

Come on, Hollywood! You're just prostituting yourself to the Capitalist Monster which is such a contradiction in terms considering that in itself is what the Left despises so much and seeks to destroy in order to achieve their goal of a one-world, one-culture, no-individuality Dystopian future. <br/><br/>5/10 and would have scored higher without the Leftist stain. <br/><br/>The leftist, bottom-feeder Whores of Hollywood churn out yet another one!"
"slicedbread117","10","2","11","1 September 2017"," Spectacular Spider-Man
","February 9th, 2015; Marvel announced their partnership with Sony to bring everybody's favorite wall-crawler to the prestigious Marvel Cinematic Universe, leaving fans dying of excitement to get a glimpse of one of the most iconic superheroes of all-time in Marvel's expansive film universe. After getting more or less of a tease in last year's 'Civil War', we finally get our first full taste of Spidey in the MCU, a film that, without question, puts the web-slinger back on the map with what I would consider to be the best Spider-Man film to date.<br/><br/>What sets Homecoming apart from its predecessors arguably the most is its clear shift in tone compared to the previous installments. A change that breathes new life into a character that some would say is getting stale in cinema, while maintaining the core of who and what Spider- Man is and stands for. Homecoming gives us the youngest version of Peter Parker we've ever seen, injecting youth and inexperience into the character, which creates a fantastic coming of age story as we journey through Peter's early days of becoming Spider-Man. What defines Spider-Man, and in turn makes him so iconic, are the choices he must make, like choosing the life he lives as a hero, often putting aside his life as a normal teenage kid. Those themes of choice are powerfully showcased in Homecoming, and Peter becomes so much more intriguing because of this. There is a unfortunate lack of Spider-Sense use but altogether, I was thrilled to see Spidey written properly, especially given the age he is in this film. Homecoming captures Spidey's personality traits perfectly, giving strong character development to Peter and in turn creating a more emotionally relatable character, the best version of the web-head we've seen yet.<br/><br/>With the help of the expert Marvel staff, director John Watts and his writers were able to uniquely re-tool what we've come to expect from a traditional origin story, replacing the scenes that we all have seen before with small bits of dialogue, keeping the focus on what's happening with Peter's story now, almost like being able to tell two origin stories in one film. The larger MCU looms large enough to make its presence felt in the immediate story, but doesn't overtake Spider-Man's individual story, which is full of heart and plenty of humor, all with textbook pacing. The script isn't without some flaws, however. There are some minor plot holes and an apparent major timeline mishap, that, until officially set right by Marvel, will keep fans of the MCU scratching their heads. Besides those minor hiccups, I have no reason not to say that Homecoming delivered a splendid, highly entertaining story, and a superb Spider-Man origin story to boot.<br/><br/>Usually the problem when talking about any Marvel film is the villain. Spider-Man has one of the top rogues galleries among superheroes, and Marvel had a golden chance to deliver a compelling villain, and sure enough, they did. Vulture was finally brought to life for the first time on the big screen, and Marvel capitalized. Vulture is given solid screen time, appropriate development and a large enough impact on the story and to Spider-Man's character to leave a lasting impression. He looked awesome, had some wonderful action scenes and was the center of a major twist in the film, which gave some shock value and emotional weight behind the character and the overall narrative. Shocker also appears as a small side-villain and is handled well for a secondary antagonist. Vulture earns his mark as one of the better MCU villains thus far for sure, simply said.<br/><br/>I don't need to go on for long about the quality of the action sequences. Fans of the MCU have come to expect top-of-the-line action, including expert stunt work, intense choreography and beautiful CGI, all things Homecoming has in spades. The inclusion of Iron Man only furthers the depth of the action and Spider-Man himself is a joy to watch in the heat of battle, kicking butt wile still maintaining that classic Spidey wit we all know and love.<br/><br/>Every character needs its actor, and Marvel hit an absolute home run with the casting of Tom Holland as our friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. Holland flawlessly executes his portrayal of a young Peter Parker, expertly seizing the essence of Spidey's witty nature along with his current inexperience and teenage persona. Holland looks the part to a tee, and is simply brilliant as Spider-Man, making the character feel as though he was pulled from the comics. Robert Downey Jr. returns as fan favorite Tony Stark/Iron Man, seamlessly weaving his years of character development through Spider-Man's story. Iron Man isn't overused in the slightest, in fact his involvement only helps the story and helps to build the greater MCU. Michael Keaton dazzles as Vulture, Jacob Batalon is hilarious as Peter's best friend Ned, John Favreau returns as Happy Hogan with a great performance, and stars Marisa Tomei and Zendaya are solid in the roles of Aunt May and Michelle respectively. Some characters, like Peter's school bully Flash, don't stand out, but overall, the supporting cast is great.<br/><br/>Fans will undoubtedly compare Homecoming to the previous Spider-Man installments, but at the end of the day, Homecoming is a completely different take of the web-slinger, and one that should be viewed and praised as its own product. Homecoming delivers on almost every front you could hope for from a MCU Spider-Man film; an exciting, character driven story with added depth by the use of Iron Man, an abundance of classic Spidey humor, a perfect adaptation of Spidey's suit, a gripping villain, a phenomenal acting performance of Spidey and his supporting characters, and most of all, the simple but proper display of the icon that is Spider-Man. Spidey is in the right hands at last with Marvel, and Spider-Man: Homecoming marks a spectacular first entry into what will be years of amazing Spidey films.<br/><br/>9.5/10"

","We're all very used to there being many Marvel movies coming out every year, and this feels like another one right from the same gears as ""Iron Man"" or ""The Avengers"", but more scaled down. It doesn't get bloated or overcrowded with invincible heroes. Which I appreciated. There's arguably less superhero action scenes then you would think and more focus on our main character's struggles in life. Is the Marvel formula getting tiresome? That's what I feared, but ""Homecoming"" manages to bring back that relate-able, friendly feeling that you had watching the Sam Raimi films. I'm happy to say this because I was not looking forward to there being a second reboot of Spider-Man.<br/><br/>If you've seen a ""Spider-Man"" movie before then you know what you are gonna get. It's a huge improvement compared to the Andrew Garfield ones. And I'm not being biased to Tom Holland or Tobey Maguire because I think all the actors who have portrayed Peter Parker have been great. It's just that all the movies haven't been the best. So, I went in with no real expectations which I think made the experience better. There's a lot of comedy here and the jokes really landed. I found myself laughing often. Especially with all the high school stuff and Happy Hogan's role in the story. I did honestly enjoy the comedy more than the action. Because all of the exciting scenes weren't so amazing, but they were alright at best. Michael Keaton plays one of the better villains in the Marvel Universe. He's not a mustache twirling bad guy, but a man with motivations you can understand. Most importantly; He was an actual person, not just a cartoon with a costume. The rest of the players are fantastic as usual. Robert Downey, Jr. brings his A game even if it's just for a supporting mentor role. The first act of the movie was the strongest with many hilarious moments. It somehow slows down in the second act and never gets as good as the beginning. The finale was not great either. Kind of lackluster which is a shame. Like I said, I enjoyed the more downplayed or funny parts more where there was no big action moment.<br/><br/>It's a crowd-pleasing one. The thing about these Marvel movies is that they are enjoyable. They know when to have fun and when to be more serious. This one brings the fun back to Spider-Man. He is not unbeatable and good at everything. He has his powers, but he hasn't learned how to use them all yet. We get to be part of that journey and at the same time see the juggling of his school life. It's a pretty innocent movie that would surely make Sam Raimi proud. Not the most original one I've seen, but a good time nonetheless."

Andrew Garfield was the best Spider Man of which he portrayed him as a controlled teenager nearly young man who's faced some problems and wears his emotions on his sleeve. While Andrew Garfield has become too old to play a teenager and I have respect from Tom Holland, he just wasn't the best pick. I think Josh Wiggins would've been a better pick for Spider Man.

","Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" (2017) for me isn't the best Spider Man movie by far. To be honest, i did like ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" (2012) and its sequel (!) much more then i did this one. Although ""Homecoming"" is pretty entertaining and fun, it felt formulaic and yes, of course, predictable (which Marvel movie isn't??!). Because these isn't anything to talk about in acting category (and that stands for all Marvel movies), needless to say movie does look good but nothing that great. It does feature some nice action scenes, but the 3rd part of this movie (in which a superhero meets super villain and as usual superhero wins) dragged - usual stuff when many things blows up but apparently no one ever dies in Marvel galaxy. <br/><br/>Overall, ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" is somehow fun and entertaining, but it does not deliver anything fresh to the table. Many were complaining about previous spider movies saying ""oh no another origins story"" - and here is a movie which does not deliver origin story and guess what - its as formulaic as Marvel movie can be. Not bad flick overall, but that's the best i can say about it."

"bledfort","Null","1","4","11 October 2017"," As entertaining as it can be for a teenage spiderman
","I enjoyed watching the movie. Tom Holland was not as bad as I tought he will be, he played the innocent, enthousiastic and easily amazed teenage spiderman. I'm glad the plot wasn't about his uncle Ben dying. I'm sick of that part to be honest.<br/><br/>It wasn't a very deep plot, just light hearted action with some funny jokes and some cool gadgets as you would expect from a suit made by Tony Stark.<br/><br/>The only downside I think, is that both the villain and spiderman, was kinda holding back a little. The villain is not that evil, not at this point anyway. Just a business man stealing from a rich corporation. And I gotta say his monologues makes sense for the most part.<br/><br/>Spiderman refuse to let someone make weapons while working for the guy who sell more weapons. Kinda hypocritical!<br/><br/>But to be fair those morality loopholes are common in both Marvel and DC. So maybe it shouldn't be taken very seriously. After all is just a super hero movie, right?<br/><br/>I think that the previous spiderman actors had put more work into their character however, because they faced more big dilemmas and were more emotionally challenged.<br/><br/>The only dilemma Tom Holland faced is whether to stop a criminal or miss a date.<br/><br/>I like that this new franchise is happening in the Avengers universe. The possibilities of awesome plots are endless. Spiderman was always a cool super hero. And I think it's not at risk with Tom Holland."

There were some similarities of this story to the first Spiderman movie. Tom as Peter did a wonderful job I feel he is better than Andrew from the amazing Spiderman but nothing compared to the first Spiderman. There have been some wonderful enhancements done on the spidey suit you have to watch the movie to know more about it. The lead female could have done a better job.

"kartoffelenvmt","7","1","4","24 August 2017"," As a teenager...
","As a teenager watching this film, it was kind of surreal. I know that the demographic for this movie was within my age group, and generally the consensus on this film was that it was good. Personally, I didn't like the film, because I think it lacked something. I understand that this was just meant to be a fun film, with no consequences, but I think the emotional depth that could've been developed I little bit more. For example, I got a bit frustrated when Peter's friend automatically forgave him after he ditched him at a party, a place he was obviously not comfortable with. I would've liked to see a little bit of conflict in that area. I appreciate the school setting, as I understand that that's what fans have been asking for for a long time, but sometimes it just felt like a drag and that it was prolonging the movie. A lot of parts could've been cut out. The comedic aspect of the film hit the mark in some places, like when he dropped the death star Lego set after seeing peter, shock horror. Other jokes were a little bit...eh. Like the porn joke, but I digress, jokes are jokes and are meant to be laughed at and not criticized. In all honesty, I would recommend this to my ~teenage~ friends because it is a solid movie for teenagers."

","Did you notice that, just like a vulture, Keaton's Adrian Toomes scoured the streets of New York, picking at dead metal, in an attempt to salvage what was left, in order to feed his family?<br/><br/>Did you notice that Tony Stark's scolding to Peter on the roof was inspired by Tony's actual characteristic, that we were given a glimpse into, during Iron Man Three?<br/><br/>Did you notice how Watts used the whole ""diversity push"" to his advantage? Instead of using one race to just traditionally replace another, he used it to strengthen his work.<br/><br/>Did you notice, that with this particular Spider-Man, because of his age, he wasn't a hero, he was a trouble maker who had the makings of a hero... because of his age, he doesn't yet have the maturity or acumen to become a hero through similar trials and errors of hero's such as Strange or Ant-Man?<br/><br/>At the age of 15, most boys have absolutely no idea how to even react or act around a girl... So imagine at that age, you get thrust into a world even Tony Stark wasn't ready for; How would you handle it? How would you react?<br/><br/>The angle Jon Watts took here, put together with trying his level best to separate this Spidey to his predecessors, makes this rendition pretty damn ingenious.<br/><br/>It's young, it's clumsy, but also smart and consistent. Spider-Man: Homecoming is setting us up for the journey of a lifetime, from when Peter was young and stupid, to what and who he'll be in Spider- Man: Homecoming 2 and 3... Stronger, smarter... Wiser.<br/><br/>My biggest gripe with Homecoming is the suit; it felt a bit too Iron Man like, and because we can't see how Peter will make it completely and totally his own just yet, it was hard to ignore.<br/><br/>From there, given the hurdles this film had to endure, and how Watts' take was truly so fresh, makes this film a Homecoming King. 7.8/10."

","Okay first of all there will always be a comparison to Toby McGuire's version. Second While Tony Stark is no role model but Iron Man is a hero and Robert Downey Jr.'s Magic makes his superhero role fabulous, hopefully the Tony Stark/ Steve Rogers (Captain America) dilemma that exploded in Civil War will quickly be resolved, it is painful to see these two awesome characters fight, there is enough intelligence, creativity and diplomacy as well as good will within the Avengers to solve this problem peacefully. Tom Holland brings to the movie something special, the innocence of Spider-Man and his Amazing and refreshing optimism and it is exactly the thing that Tony Stark needs to remind him what a hero is all about and us all as well. We need peace, we need good leaders, love not war, unity and the belief in an America that stands for all that is good and just, similar to what Captain America spoke of in his films and in the Avengers. The ideals of all men created equal, justice, truth, compassion not killing, not hate is what America is about and what makes it great. Please remember also the comics code Authority to protect children from objectionable material, remember comics were made for kids yet when Marvel and DC went Mainstream they got rid of it, not cool. Bring it back, we need to protect our kids from all the grime that is circulating the world is becoming evil, dark and horrid and no we don't want that! Avengers Infinity War, please make sure that Thanos looks really cool and doesn't act doofish someone of this caliber has to have a real presence, the movie has to pull all the stops this is the big one, maybe it should be 2hours 30 minutes long, also get rid of the kitari aliens and bring a better cooler looking better alien race like the Skrulls! Finally Avengers vs. Justice League has to happen and will top 2 billion or even hit 3 billion at the theaters and the public (both camps DC and Marvel) should vote on which hero will win each contest. YEs the movie should include Darseid and Galactus and feature the Fantastic Four (which deserve another and final remake, this time do get it right. For example, you had the Torch and Thing done right in the first film, but you need a smart, serious scientist, for Mr. Fantastic with leadership qualities and beautiful but pure Sue Storm. This time Dr. Doom must wear the armor and dark green cloak, the armor is the equivalent of Iron Mans and he is a superior foe. Also bring back Silver Surfer but he must look more natural when in silver form and all the time he is shown, he really is a remarkable and visually dazzling hero, and his purity and goodness is truly beautiful, like an angel, we need to see more of him.)and a cameo with the X-men to show they do share the same world, and on that note the Avengers need to show the X-men and mention their existence as part of the same world.<br/><br/>Lastly the New Mutants should have a cameo with Spidey in it and they should have a full $100 million + budget with all the effects of a major film and the next X-men, because the films just didn't look like they had a big budget. Naturally the script and story should be tight and the costumes should remain close to the comics, the black tights look great, have a reference to Alpha Flight and show some members of the X-men to show continuity, it would be great to have Halle Berry back as Storm and Picard as Xavier cameo, this time make sure Storms hair looks natural, flowing and beautiful not as it did in the feature films where it looked like a wig, please. I would love to see the Rhino with the mech armor, or Morbius in the next film or both."

","I loved this movie it was hilarious with the moments of people being exposed by his best friend and his friend would not stop asking him questions like ""dude do you lay eggs?"" that line alone had a nerd like me in tears from laughing. I loved the connection between Peter Parker and Tony Stark basically wanting to be his best friend and his father. But I also like how Tony Stark was saving him and training him and he took the suit back from Peter and Peter learns the lesson that he does not need Tony Stark's invention suit to be a successful super hero. And he develops as a super hero by fighting for what's right and realizing sacrifices will have to be made if you want this lifestyle. My favorite part to this movie was the ending when his aunt may found out he was spiderman just like in the comic books."
"patomartinezfgo","8","1","4","6 August 2017"," Great and fun summer movie
","Spider Man: Homecoming is everything a summer movie embodies. I really had a good time with this film.<br/><br/>This movie doesn't cover the origin story of Spiderman, which is a great relief since we have seen it twice. instead, we meet a Peter Parker that has already fought in Civil War and has more experience fighting crime. And since we don't have uncle Ben anymore, the ""father"" figure is Tony Stark. I believed that having a character that knows Peter's secret as the father figure was a really great choice since we get to see him interact not only with Peter, but also with Spiderman.<br/><br/>The movie was pretty fun. There were a lot of clever and innocent jokes in the movie and they managed to get a good laugh out of you. I thought they handled the high- school stuff with the Hero stuff pretty well and you get a nice balance.<br/><br/>And Michael Keaton as Vulture was pretty great... for a marvel villain. Most Marvel villains suck, and this one is surprisingly kind of cool. He has a nice back story and some good connections with Peter Parker. Their confrontations are pretty good and entertaining.<br/><br/>They do make some changes to the source material. Like Peter Parker having a best friend that isn't Harry Osborn. Actually, his friend was a pretty cool character, as well as the other supporting cast. They also make his suit do a lot of crazy things that the original spiderman couldn't do and actually get rid of some of spiderman's powers.<br/><br/>As far as action scenes and cinematography, its as good as a Marvel movie can get. Its not bad, but it isn't anything really eye-grabbing, its just there to fill its purpose.<br/><br/>The score was surprisingly good, although it doesn't top Sam Raimi's score.<br/><br/>In Conclusion, its not the best Spiderman movie, but its up there. You should watch it if you are the kind of person that keeps up with the marvel universe."

","I enjoyed this film. I went in knowing it was aimed at a teen audience, and was not actually for anyone over 30.<br/><br/>Holland is not the best guy for this role, though he gamely tries to carry it off. The actors playing Peter's classmates are fairly convincing as high schoolers. The writing and performances are solid here. Keaton does well as Toomes/The Vulture, as I knew he would.<br/><br/>I take issue with Tony Stark's suit for Peter. It does not belong in this movie (or any of the Maguire/Garfield films, for that matter). This seems like an attempt to sell toys. He's not Iron Man Jr., he's Spidey. No need for all that tech, as other reviewers have noted.<br/><br/>Speaking of some of the other reviewers... their vitriol seems a bit unwarranted to me (railing against ""SJW"" and ""Political Correctness""). One person wrote: ""...with typical modern Hollywood touch to blackwash characters. Peter Parker's stepmom is now Mexican (?), girlfriend African and his best buddy Malaysian. How about that for a zoo? Minus 2 stars for that."" Another arch conservative wrote: ""...Filled with unnecessary SJW agenda that Marvel will probably build up to full force in Black Panther and Captain Marvel. Zendaya's character is nothing but a full throttle SJW who protests and refuses to appropriate to society."" Um, a zoo? That's not a loaded/pejorative term at all, coming from a conservative describing non-whites.<br/><br/>I guess I don't read enough ""conservative"" new sites, as this is the first time I have ever heard of the term ""blackwash"".<br/><br/>A question - How exactly is MJ supposed to ""appropriate to society""? Google Translate doesn't seem to work on this phrase.<br/><br/>I don't think these reviewers even paid attention to the film, as a significant amount of what they write is blatantly inaccurate.<br/><br/>Last but not least, I must add this. Spider-Man, like many of the Marvel titles, is set in New York City. One of, if not the, most diverse places in the country. Even if these conservatives go back to the comics from the 1980s, they will see that even then there was diversity depicted in the Amazing Spider-Man and the Spectacular Spider-Man. And it wasn't just Joe Robertson (Glory Grant, Cloak of Cloak and Dagger, Luke Cage and quite a few others).<br/><br/>I have a suggestion for these conservatives who find movies like this so objectionable. The cast lists for major characters of these movies are available before the openings, so one can see which actor plays which character. And this and other sites show previews. How about you guys help Make Hollywood Great Again and just don't give these horrible diverse movies your money."

","Marvel knows it's characters best and so it's no surprise that this version of Spider-Man feels more natural than the previous ones. Tobey Maguires and Sam Raimis Spider-Man movies where great, especially the second one, but they have been kind of serious compared to this movie. So if you're searching for a thrilling fun ride of a movie, look no further. Marvel is establishing their funny tone they invented with Guardians of the Galaxy. It seems that their strategy now is to inject this into all the properties. The Thor:Ragnar√∂k Trailer points in a similar direction.<br/><br/>As of the actors, everybody fits their parts very well. Tom Holland is the Stand Out and to be honest he seems to be Peter Parker even in real life. The only person i think was kind of off was surprisingly Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark. He didn't feel as energetic and realistic as he was in the first Iron Man or Avengers Movie.<br/><br/>So why am i not giving it more than a rating of 8. Simply because there is no impact and nothing really fresh like for example in Wonder Woman. Although, i liked the smaller scale and teen-movie feel of this version of the friendly spider. So go watch it."
"Rickting","8","1","4","21 July 2017"," The first awesome Spider-Man film for 13 years
","Tom Holland Is Spider-Man. We'll always have Tobey Maguire, but Tom Holland has the charm, the humour, the emotional depth and first and foremost, he looks and acts like a kid. So, armed with the best Spider-Man portrayal to date, the MCU brings Spider-Man swinging into cinemas- for the third time in 15 years. Rest assured; this is a good film. This is a review coming from someone who's grown pretty fed up with the MCU lately. The key thing about Spider-Man Homecoming is that it's fun. It's a witty, funny high-school movie that happens to be full of superheroes. It's also uneven, features a somewhat dull would-be love interest (Though thankfully nothing as annoying as Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane Watson- this movie's MJ is very interesting) and has a far more workman-like director than Sam Raimi or Marc Webb at the helm, but those issues don't hold the movie back. Fun action, a fast, charming, witty and ultra-cool screenplay and all-around strong performances make this a very good time at the movies, and the decision to show Spidey's emotional turmoil and coming of age instead of his origins was a masterstroke. This suggests a bright future for Spider-Man in the MCU- and it has one of the best, if not The best, MCU post-credits scenes ever.<br/><br/>8/10"
"rippetoe18","8","1","4","13 July 2017"," One of the strongest MCU and Spider-Man films
","To me, the MCU has been floundering since Winter Soldier and Guardians of the Galaxy. Civil War was good, but very overrated, Guardians 2 was just good, and Ant-Man was just okay. This movies broke the so-so streak and delivered a fun, funny, and interesting take on the character of Spider-Man.<br/><br/>The Good: <br/><br/>* Tom Holland makes a great Spider-Man. He's charismatic and funny, but also sells the emotional scenes well, too. <br/><br/>* I really liked the high school angle. Peter is still in school, so I'm glad it plays such a big part in the movie. <br/><br/>* Michael Keaton is easily one of the MCU's best villains. While the writing for him was only so-so, Keaton really elevated the role into someone really menacing.<br/><br/>The Bad: <br/><br/>* I don't like the Spider-Man suit very much. Not only the looks (the suit from the Raimi movies is better looking by far in my opinion), but also the suit giving him extra abilities I wish he could do or figure out himself. <br/><br/>* The direction wasn't nearly as good as Sam Raimi's in the original Spider-Man trilogy. The action scenes were surprisingly mediocre, however the actors themselves were directed well. <br/><br/>* Nit-picky, but I still don't like hot Aunt May. This was only made worse by everyone drawing attention to it when she was on screen.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a great Spider-Man movie, but I still like Raimi's first two Spider-Man movies better. However, this Spider-Man series has nowhere to look but up.<br/><br/>Final score: B"
"Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","9","1","4","13 July 2017"," The Best Spiderman Film Since Sam Raimi's Spiderman 2!
","Spiderman Homecoming is a good time at the movies; though it falls a little short of Marvel Studios' past offerings, this Spidey Film is a MASSIVE improvement over Sony's The Amazing Spiderman 2. Homecoming is really a celebration of the character and his 50 + years of Marvel history. If anything, it's frustrating that Spiderman wasn't introduced sooner to the MCU. <br/><br/>I'm just glad that Sony and Disney came to an understanding and agreed to such a remarkable production deal. Now Fox needs to do the same damn thing or else suffer the consequences BIG TIME!<br/><br/>As a film, Homecoming is still a solid Spiderman film and the characters inhabiting the MCU give this Spiderman film life that the previous ones were lacking (The Amazing Spiderman movies in this case). The film is lively, fun and the pacing is just the right amount of laid-back high school drama and high-octane action sequences this movie needed to have. No more repeated origin stories here, no more Uncle-Ben's-death here, just a movie about this universe's already established Spiderman and how he learns to grow up. It's great seeing Marvel's best hero finally arrive home, hence the movie's title; which I don't want to repeat right here.<br/><br/>Tom Holland is fantastic as Spiderman and Peter Parker: for the first time you can believe that THIS guy is both characters. Tobey Maguire mastered the awkward Peter Parker and cool but less-comedic Spiderman. Andrew Garfield was a more charming Parker yet wittier Spidey. Imagine these traits from both Spidermen mixed into Holland's performance and you have a story that balances out the high-school life and superhero life in the one movie nearly perfectly.<br/><br/>Homecoming is a true return to form for Spiderman as one of superhero cinema's most recognisable icons and champions. It suggests a brighter and more open-ended future for the character and doesn't repeat anything needlessly. It's a breeze of a movie that doesn't get too bogged down in teasing anything else besides this: Spiderman's back and he's here to stay."

","(RATING: ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ out of 5 ) <br/><br/>GRADE: B <br/><br/>THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.<br/><br/>IN BRIEF: A superhero movie that does not take itself so seriously and benefits from its off-beat humor and winning cast.<br/><br/>SYNOPSIS: The Spiderman saga retold, with a new cast of heroes and villains. <br/><br/>JIM'S REVIEW: I am just soooo tire of comic book superhero movies! They usually follow the same by-the-numbers formula (hero gets superpowers, hero learns how to use those powers effectively, hero fight diabolical super villain, hero saves the world...end of story...that is, until the next installment.) Neither the superhero (or their filmmakers) have much courage to go outside of the lines and be halfway original or clever. (Yes, there have been some recent entries that have actually shown some creativity, Doctor Strange, Logan, and Wonder Woman being three fine examples, but those films are rarities in this lost in translation genre.) <br/><br/>ÔøºWhich brings us to the latest superhero saga, Spiderman: Homecoming, the third incarnation of this Marvel series crusader. Now, let's make that four!<br/><br/>While there are some flaws to its storytelling, the film has much to admire. It still suffers from much of that ""same sameness"" that I previously mentioned...the perfunctory plot structure, temporary mishaps that befall any superhero, an overabundance of set action pieces that rely too heavily on CGI...Spiderman: Homecoming falls into those traps but also adds some nice bits of originality along the way. (It even tries a plot twist that did not surprise me, but (from the audience reaction) worked very successfully on most of the moviegoers around me.) <br/><br/>ÔøºSo what makes this so much more watchable than most of this ilk? Some positive factors are:<br/><br/>1. a gawky superhero that actually acts his chronological age of 15 years old (but still looks slightly older, more like 16 going on 17) 2. a wonderful wry sense of humor that frequently works, with enough insider jokes to placate the fanboys and others 3. a sympathetic villain (well played by Michael Keaton) that is not into world domination, but more into protesting the working class struggle 4. as written, a character in which an actor plays up the teenage novice angle and dwells less of the mighty hero fixation<br/><br/>Wearing that famous red and blue spandex outfit now is Tom Holland. (Tobey McGuire and Andrew Garland have previously played the role with much success in previous movies.) Mr. Holland has youth and inexperience on his side and he uses his ah-shucks demeanor and rushed nasal voice to make Peter Parker a more complex and real teenager filled with all the angst and problems of peer pressure that gives most adolescent moviegoers the ability to relate. Mr. Holland brings authenticity to his character and a goofy awkwardness that helps us automatically suspend belief and buy into the standard mechanics of a plot that does meander.<br/><br/>Then, who does one root for, the semi-evil Vulture or our feisty webmaster? Klutzy teenager vs. criminal mastermind? Both characters are equal adversaries in this version and the actors bring nuance to their roles, which elevates the film tremendously.<br/><br/>Director John Watts wisely concentrates on the human drama behind the masks. He takes the time to establish the villain's motives and makes him less of a cartoon nemesis. He focuses on our hero, the nerd, coming to terms with his new image while gaining self confidence and inner strength, although the ineptness issues do go on a bit too long. Yet that story is actually more interesting than the many overblown set action pieces of CGI technology. These action scenes do hold one's interest, even if the proportions of Spidey and his surroundings, the less than ideal staging, and close-up blurry movement blunts the impact. The side story about Spiderman joining forces with the Avengers crew may interest some loyal comic book fans but that angle simply bored me. (The best sequence in the film, by far, is peril on the Staten Island Ferry; the weakest being the climactic fight scene.)<br/><br/>ÔøºSome other filmmaking decisions that paid off: Love interest? A little, but more time is spent on the bromance between Peter and his buddy, Ned (Jacob Batalon, a strong casting choice, playing against stereotype most effectively). Fortunately there is also less exposition spent about Spiderman's origins and background, although Marissa Tomei as his Aunt May provides a warm addition to the cast. Also contributing fine support is Jon Favareu, Zendaya, Laura Harrier, and Robert Downey, Jr. as you-know-who.<br/><br/>Spiderman: Homecoming is a delightfully entertaining comic book blockbuster that knows its source well enough to bust through the tired clich√©s that entrap most other superhero films. It uses its smart sense of humor to win you over and comes up a real winner."

Their final fight was too dark (Night fight scene) and not so epic. There was no shocking moment, even after the shocker appeared. 'Just like that?' came to my mind after their final fight finished.

","Wasn't sure about this entry after the trailers, but am happy with the outcome. The Good : Tom Holland as Peter Parker/Spider-man is an absolute treat to watch. Don't think it's fair comparing his take to Tobey's or Andrew's version of the character as the universe it is set in is totally different. I do believe that all 3 actors did justice to the material that was given to them. Bearing that in mind...the material for this one was 'Good Old Fashioned Fun'so there was very little about it not to like. Michael Keaton as The Vulture...Loved every bit of it! The motivations for his villainy (though clich√©'d) come out beautifully with his performance. Driven and unpredictable...I mean, what more could you ask for? If I watched this film for a 2nd time, it would be for Michael Keaton's Vulture! Now, The Not So Good : This isn't really the movie's fault, but nothing Spider-man does on film has the VOW effect on me anymore! Seeing the action in Spider- man (2002) particularly the sequence right before the end titles left me blown away and wanting more. I guess there have just been too many action sequences over the course of 7 films (and 3 franchises now) that they just come across as ""Been there, Done That!"" I am taking into account that I'm 38 years old today as opposed to 23 when the first film came out (and 5 when I saw Nicholas Hammond in the TV show) so that probably has a lot to do with my sentiment, and I probably sound stupid complaining about a movie about a guy who swings and climbs for a living when he actually swings and climbs, but maybe the filmmakers need to find a way to make the action look fresher and less generic in comparison to the previous entries. That being said...still enjoyed it to a degree The Bad - (or what I didn't like) The High Tech Suit : I tried to like it, even bearing in mind that this a next gen Spidey set in a world with Alien Invasions and whatnot, but it was lost on me! There was a point in the movie where I felt Peter didn't need his inherent Spidey Powers because the suit seemed to be doing all the work. Betty Brant could have been in that suit and it would have done something. What I love most about Peter Parker in the comics is his limited resources yet genius intellect which brings me to my second point :- From whatever angle you look at it, Shared Universe or not - Avenger or not, Spider-man is the Crown Jewel of the Marvel Universe. It does not feel good as a fan to see him upstaged in his own film! All due respect to Marvel and what they've done with Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man, but the whole mentor thing took away a bit of zing from the experience. If I remember correctly, there is an arc in the comic where Peter Parker hacks in to the Stark Industries main frame thereby getting recruited as an Avenger, not the other way round where he is chasing them like a lost lamb. Sigh of relief when Peter declines the offer in the end! Still....A Enjoyable Experience where the Good very much outweighs the Bad. Look forward to a lot more Spidey (stand alone) with a little less Avenger!"
"hjalsayegh","7","1","4","8 July 2017"," Finally a good Spider-man AND Peter Parker Movie!
","We are now at the third re-boot of the spider-man movies.... AND IT'S NOT AN ORIGIN STORY!!! Thank you Marvel!<br/><br/>The Movie starts from that cameo in Captain America and just keeps going from there. Peter met the great Tony Stark and is now star struck. the movie is him trying to prove that he's not just a kid in need of gloves but a man and totally Avenger material!<br/><br/>A coming of age story of a 15 year old kid still in school, what could be more Spider-man then that! <br/><br/>Tom Holland (as our hero) Is very charming as both personas and pretty much carries this movie... which brings me to the negative part, I'm not sure if this was done on purpose but all the supporting case in this movie acted like they've never been in front of a camera before. Aunt May, Liz (the love interest) and his best friend Ned were down right annoying at times and awkward the rest of it. <br/><br/>There is rest of the supporting cast were just too obvious in their roles that it just felt forced. There was Zero chemistry on screen...<br/><br/>The Antagonist however is another story, Micheal Keaton as the ""vulture"" was down right menacing and I don't think he had to raise his voice once to achieve that. Easily one of the more memorable villains in the MCU!<br/><br/>The Movie has a quirky sense of humor which will have you smiling, and if that doesn't get you stick around to the end credit scene. <br/><br/>Overall this was an enjoyable movie, the supporting cast and some of the choices they made (The actually tried to play it safe here) weighed the movie down a bit for me. I'd give it a 6/10 but it got an extra star due to the amazing performances by Holland and Keaton, those two carried this movie on steal (and web!) wings!"

"samgironda","7","1","4","8 July 2017"," Spider-Man is back!
","'Spider-Man Homecoming' takes place after the events of 'Captain America: Civil War' where Peter Parker is finding it difficult to settle back into his normal and everyday routine of attending School and dealing with the many responsibilities of being a teenager. Tom Hollands performance in the film is outstanding. He makes a perfect Spider-Man and easily portrays the comedic and fun loving superhero all Spider-Man fans know and love. Throughout the film we see Peter deal with a lot of different, emotional situations. There is a scene towards the end of the film which really shows the character struggling and not being sure of himself. Tom Hollands acting in these scenes is great and being part of the audience, it allows you to feel that emotion and understand what Peter Parker is dealing with. One of the main concerns that many people had about this film was the involvement of Tony Stark. Many fans were worried about the character stealing the spotlight but it's safe to say that his screen time was distributed perfectly and he was a great asset to the film. Michael Keaton's portrayal as the Vulture was great. His character had motive for what he was doing and wasn't just shoehorned in the film for the sake of it. Michael Keaton is great at portraying such serious and menacing characters and in this film it definitely payed off. The overall story ran very smoothly. All the characters were introduced really well and we continued to learn a little more about them as the film progressed. There were no boring parts in the film or certain scenes that felt like they dragged on for too long. It was great to see a Marvel Studios take on a Spider-Man film and I can't wait to see where this character ends up next."
"RussHog","7","1","4","8 July 2017"," Michael Keaton is awesome as Vulture!
","Spider-Man: Homecoming is a movie about a kid with super powers who wants to join a super team - but he has to prove that he can learn how to master his powers. At the same time - there is an adult who has chosen a life of crime who has learned full mastery over the technology that grants him powers - and these two are headed for a showdown of good v evil. <br/><br/>Michael Keaton is great as the villain - easily the best part of the film. It is just awesome to see Michael Keaton as the bad guy. He delivered all of his lines like a boss and the costume design for his character is fantastic. One could consider this a huge moment in comic pop culture for Michael Keaton to own this film. <br/><br/>The story is not that great. There are themes about the 1% and the 99% - but there is very little ""emotion"" in the motion picture. However there was a cool reversal at the end I did not see coming.<br/><br/>In the end - I don't think Spider-Man was a great heroic film - but it was fun and I would like to see more Spider-Man villains brought to life in this unique cinematic Spider-Man experience. It is a huge improvement from the horribleness of the previous installments - and Michael Keaton was awesome as the bad guy!"

","Dear god, some haters in here....<br/><br/>The movies is good, the jokes are maybe cringy to some people, but they are perfect for the vibe of the movie.<br/><br/>Some people complain that Iron Man is present a lot in the movie, but that is false. He is primarily there to set up the main conflict, not with the vulture, but with the line in every trailer so far. ""If you are nothing without this suit, you shouldn't have it."". The suit is highly technological and not just a piece of cloth and maybe that turned some people of, but I felt this makes more sense and fits in with the thematic of the main villain.<br/><br/>The acting was OK by the secondary characters but the Vulture, Iron man and spidey were superb.<br/><br/>Obligatory great CGI comment. Good fight scenes.<br/><br/>The ending is both satisfactory and not at the same time and really nails in the point of the movie as a whole, a point that most haters missed. Spider man is not just a fancy high-tech suit.<br/><br/>All in all, I like it and would gladly watch it again...and again...and maybe again."

","The spider is back, much younger and much more fun, as it should have been from the beginning.<br/><br/>Although I think SpiderMan 2 remains the best in terms of balance between story and action, this movie (just like Garfield's last two) is good.<br/><br/>It has a suburban history, a villain (Keaton) who has the empathy to not be forgotten so soon and, fortunately, opens great prospects.<br/><br/>Plus, Tom Holland, proving to everyone that he is a young man with a senior talent, exhibits himself at an astounding level, either as an impatient teenager of this new generation or as a frail kid who literally sees everything collapsing around him. That scene in which he finally discovers that he is alone in the world, that there is nobody to help him and that he has to leave alone gave me shivers.<br/><br/>Downey Jr's charisma as Tony Stark no longer surprises anyone, but continues to show itself every time he appears on screen, especially as a paternal figure for this new spidey.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the casting, they do not have much to do with what they are given. They almost always serve as comic relief and little else. I was expecting more of the hot Aunt May, but what's there to do for Tomei when they do not give her much time in the movie? Anyway, let's wait for the sequel ..."

","You know you are getting old when you start fancying Aunty May! Then again actress Marisa Tomei is only a few years older than me.<br/><br/>Spiderman has been rebooted again but at least we are spared another origins story. With close interaction with the Marvel universe, Tom Holland having debuted in Captain America: Civil War now has his own standalone film with Iron Man and Captain America popping up here and there.<br/><br/>Holland's Peter Parker is an overexcitable teenager pestering Tony Stark to let him become an Avenger. Stark gives him an all tech Spidey suit as well as the services of Happy Hogan.<br/><br/>The bad guy is The Vulture/Adrian Toomes played by Michael Keaton, a salvage contractor that cleans up alien artifacts that has been put out of business by Stark's companies. Now he uses alien technology for nefarious means such as heists and that puts him on a collision course with Spiderman. However Parker does not realise how close to home Toomes really is.<br/><br/>The film never really soared for me, I think I was put off by the bored looking Jon Favreau playing Happy Hogan and maybe they should had toned down the appearances of Tony Stark who is in it a bit too much.<br/><br/>There were some nice set pieces such as Spiderman saving his schoolmates from the Washington Monument. It was fun seeing Keaton as the Vulture after the actor hit the limelight again by playing Birdman but I did not think much of the villain apart from an honest man who became a leader of a bunch of thugs."

That said, spiderman was as annoying as he was in civil war (maybe even more so) the idea of spiderman being a kid about the age of the Runaways just isn't improving the character for me, also this entire reboot glossed over spiderman's origins even more then Batman's origins were in the Batman v. Superman (there wasn't even an Uncle Ben referenced). The nerdy buddy who knows his identity didn't really help the movie either. I just don't think Tom Holland's a good spiderman... but theres still a chance he might grow into the character."
"jcallows","7","1","5","24 October 2017"," almost amazing
","Spider-Man: Homecoming could've been great if it had been a stand-alone film. Instead, its constant references to the Avengers weighed it down. It's tied so closely to the Avengers it should've been called Spider-Man: The Seventh Avenger.<br/><br/>But coming to the rescue were Tom Holland and Michael Keaton. They were great. Also, having Spider-Man be younger, more playful and witty was a refreshing change. I don't read comics but apparently this new depiction of Spider-Man was more inline with the comics than previous depictions.<br/><br/>Ironically, if this Spider-Man reboot was supposed to stay truer to the comics, it only did so in some aspects. At least it did get the main character, Spider-Man, right but if you're looking for more, you'd be disappointed. Other characters were changed slightly. Their ages and races were changed. And Spider-Man's suit is now tech created by Stark. It's practically another Ironman suit that does all the work.<br/><br/>Despite this film's strong ties to the Avengers, its ham-fisted attempt at political correctness, and a Spider-Man suit that does everything for whoever who wears it, the strong performances by Tom Holland and Michael Keaton made this film enjoyable to watch.<br/><br/>Tom Holland was great. Then again, I thought Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield were fine too. If there's one thing I've learned from watching all these Spider-Man films, it's that anybody can play Spider-Man."

","I was very confident that Spider-Man: Homecoming was going to be great, and I was right, but I just wished it was going to be similar to the original, and it is, but it didn't set up everything like it did in the original, but i'm pretty sure no-one would want to see an origin story again.<br/><br/>Story:9/10<br/><br/>After the events of Captain America: Civil War, we see Peter learning about his powers, and himself. Back when Loki was trying to invade New York, we see the aftermath, and workers cleaning it all up when they lose their jobs from a different organization, and that anger motivated Adrian Toomes/Vulture to get a new job by getting the scraps of the alien weapons and selling them. 8 years later Peter Parker is trying to get the attention of Tony Stark, he aims to shut down Adrian Toomes, and his crew. I like the story, it's simple, and there's no huge risk of the world ending, and the only stakes is losing his aunt, and his friend, and I respect that.<br/><br/>Characters: 8/10<br/><br/>Peter Parker: Peter is a perfect example of a teenager, clumsy, and irresponsible, and I love that, it shows that Spider-Man isn't a professional, he's just a kid.<br/><br/>Vulture: Vulture is a questionable character, he is intimidating, but his motives are questionable, but I get his motives, it's just not strong enough.<br/><br/>Tony Stark: Tony is just Tony, he's still the lovable Iron-Man, nothing has changed dramatically with him, I don't have much to say about him to be honest.<br/><br/>Ned: Ned is just a great character, he's so nerdy, and awkward it's funny, I feel like if Ned wasn't in the movie it would lower the score.<br/><br/>Action: 8/10<br/><br/>This movie has awesome action, it's entertaining, and funny, I have never laughed so hard in this movie then any other movie I have watched. There's also a lot of time spent in the high school, and I like that because it shows that it's hard to be a super-hero and have to deal with school.<br/><br/>Overall this is a great Spider-Man movie, it wasn't as good as the original because the Peter Parker in the original was doing all these things from his heart, but in this movie he's doing to become an Avenger, which isn't bad, it just doesn't feel like the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man."

","This Spiderman movie brings the titular web-head under Marvel Studios and into the Marvel Cinematic Universe - finally!<br/><br/>After a cameo with other avengers (see Captain America 3 - Civil War) young Peter Parker, still coming to grips with his ability, looks to develop and grow under the tutelage of Iron Man a.k.a. Tony Stark. Off the back of the wreckage that previous Marvel/Avenger films have left, Michael Keaton's Adrian Toomes works to clean up the country by dismantling alien technology. After he is forced out of business he goes it alone (with a band of merry henchmen) collecting tech and transforming it into an arsenal he can utilize to get rich. Spiderman accidentally stumbles upon his plans and is forced to put a stop to it, while trying to keep his identity, his friends and his countrymen safe from harm. <br/><br/>Tom Holland picks up the mantle of Peter Parker for this movie and for me nails his performance moreso than the on-screen Spidermen that have gone before him. He comes across as neurotic and paranoid which for me is an accurate portrayal of the web-head which has kept comic fans happy for years. Spiderman isn't an out and out superhero, he's more delicate and geeky than that, he's more of a friendly neighborhood Spiderman. Opposing Spiderman, Keaton's portrayal of Toomes is gritty, nasty and evil. It works brilliantly and Keaton has managed to go from superhero (Batman) to super villain like not many actors before him. There are elements and portrays of characters in this film which aren't strictly true to the comic book roots but they didn't stand out as off putting so hardcore comic fans should be comfortable still. As you'd expect with a Marvel studio's film there is a lot of fun in this film, mixed with action, adventure and humour. Visually the film is sharp and engaging and the soundtrack is very complimentary. <br/><br/>This is a solid addition to the MCU and is a fun and family friendly film to enjoy. It would have been easy to reboot the whole thing again but instead of doing the whole 'origins' story again the film assumes the audience is clever enough to know who Spiderman is and jumps more or less straight into a story, bravo on this, if I'd have seen another origin story I think I'd have been bored. Instead this is a 133 min's of pure fun. Sit back and enjoy!"

","Before stepping foot into the theater to watch this film, I was a bit skeptical, to say the least. I'm not a fan of superhero movies, however, from the very first opening credit, I knew that this would be a spectacular extravaganza. The cinematography and effects are phenomenal, but what makes this film is the surprisingly original take on a very overused blockbuster story. Every character is its own, completely set apart from the other spider-man films, and every actor executes their role flawlessly. I was so happy to find that the characters actually looked like actual high-schoolers, and apart from the hair-raising action, it was a wonderfully crafted teenage comedy and portrayed a relatable story with a diverse array of characters. I particularly enjoyed Zendaya's and Martin Starr's characters and felt they played their roles with perfect comedic timing. I highly recommend this film."
"robsyhop","9","1","5","7 August 2017"," Spider-man 3.0 is back and better than ever
","I love this movie so much, compared to the past Spider-men, Tom Holland has done the best (by far). His constant commentary on things really helps Spider-man/Peter Parker seem the age he's meant to be. I also like the fact that Marvel didn't have Harry Osborn for once to change things up, and added Ned Leeds instead. <br/><br/>Not having the death of uncle Ben or the part where Peter gained his powers made the movie more for fans but my sister, who doesn't watch many of the movies managed understand what was going on. It was also cool that it was set in a middle school instead of a high school. I really liked the costume better that the past ones, mostly because it was bolder and closer to the comics but also because it was high- tech without looking like it was.<br/><br/>I really like this movie and I think even if your not into Marvel or Spider-man there's still a good chance that you'll like it. If anyone's wanting the original comic book Spidey, I'm sorry to say but he won't be there. The new Spidey is funnier, younger and more high-tech than ever before. He also has that charm that you see in recent Spider- man cartoons."
"RNMorton","8","1","5","23 July 2017"," The Best Yet
","So Toby Maguire did a nice job but always looked a little too old for the title character. And there were other problems with the early Spiderman, too much slow romantic entanglement and unentanglements, plus derivative plots. E.g., Spiderman III has some great fight scenes a lot of dreary moments and a plot derivative even from its own earlier movies. I didn't like the second Spiderman, skipped II on that. This Spiderman feels quite right, the movie gets extra juice having Tony Stark involved but that's somewhat of a mixed blessing, I might have liked to see a little less Stark in the plot. Michael Keaton has always been a favorite for me, the best movie Batman, and he plays a finely textured villain in this one. Enjoyable movie, they could have cut 10-15 minutes running time without losing anything."

I'm more of a DC fan myself and I've never really understood the big deal about Spiderman, oh sure he can swing from place to place and have super strength which is fine but what else can he do? Anyway the new spidey is played by Tom Holland who I had hadn't heard of and he's British, those Brits fooled me again gosh darn it. He plays Spiderman/Peter Parker who is a freshman in High School and he's trying to deal with being a teen, doing homework, girls and oh yeah being a secret superhero who's trying to proof himself to Tony Stark/Iron Man who is played by Rodney Downey Jr who claims he's not playing the role anymore after Avengers Infinity Wars but frankly I don't believe him because he loves the role. Tom/Spiderman is trying to prove to Tony/Iron Man that he can join the Avengers but Tony feels he's not ready and to be patience but he's a teenagers their not patience believe me. I have one in the house who is 13 who is so impatience it's annoying. Kids these days.<br/><br/>Michael Keaton plays the bad guy Vulture which is not to my liking. I'm not use to him playing the villain he's Batman for goodness sake but he played Vulture with a tough exterior of the character and not to mess with him or get in his way.<br/><br/>Now I'm just going say it but that girl Zendaya who played Michelle was ANNOYING. Oh my God I wanted to smack her and say ""Dude your jokes aren't funny, go away and bother someone else."" but I can't cause I wasn't in the movie BUT if I had been it would have been funnier than her lame behind. Anyway sorry I had to get that off my chest, she really gets on my nerves. Please tell me it's not just me. And Jon Favreau as Happy Hogan annoyed me too but not as much as Zendaya.<br/><br/>The special effect of the movie were great. I wish I could fly around the city instead of using my feet but I'm not spiderwoman. I thought the script was a bit played out, I mean typical kid who is a superhero having problems with school, women and oh defeating the world. Not saying that's a bad thing but it's been done before many times from other Spiderman films I just wanted something a bit different. Why can't we see Spiderman grow up and take on the world. Why does he always have to be a teen.<br/><br/>I did like Peter's sidekick/friend Ned who discovered that his best friend is a superhero. Who wouldn't want a friend to be a hero? Ned gives some comic relief to many of the scenes which I found enjoyable.<br/><br/>Anyway should you see this film? Hmm well it depends if you're a superhero fan then yes see it. If not, maybe stay at home and wait for it to on demand or Redbox. It's up to you but I would recommend it."
"obiegimmie","9","1","5","21 July 2017"," 'Spider Man: Homecoming' Movie Review
","'Spider-Man: Homecoming,' is, in summary, an enjoyable and lighthearted movie that I had fun watching. <br/><br/>The incarnation of Spider-Man has endured much throughout the ages. Originated in 1962 by Stan Lee, Peter Parker, an everyday high-schooler from Queens, defied earlier concepts of comic heroism by being particularly young, pure, and innocent. And his commercial success was evident; becoming one of the highest grossing comic book heroes in Marvel history. Inevitably, several film adaptations were planned, the most significant being a 2002-2007 trilogy featuring Tobey Maguire. <br/><br/>These films are known for being shamefully lighthearted and fun, and focused on Peter Parker's steady character arc as he continually struggles with the identity and purpose of a hero. Rather than an angsty, troubled, tortured, hero, we received one with undeniable hope. The trilogy, while generally liked, is often cited for being too juvenile and simplistic. I think that, while a bit simplistic, these movies captured the general essence and innocence of Peter Parker and his growth as a hero. <br/><br/>After these films had overstayed their welcome and became steadily worse, The Amazing Spider-Man of 2012 and its sequel of 2014 starred Andrew Garfield. These were noticeably edgier, darker, and more adult-like. The first film was welcomed to relatively warm reception, namely for Garfield's performance, which, as Tom Charity of CNN writes, ""...combination of fresh-faced innocence, nervous agitation and wry humor ...immediately appealing..."" <br/><br/>In contrast, the second installment, released 2014, is known as the downfall of a theatrical Spider-Man for its, as Rotten Tomatoes puts it, ""unfocused narrative and an overabundance of characters.""<br/><br/>Spider-Man: Homecoming is a different, lighter, and better variation on the Spider-Man story. Rather than focus on aspects of Peter Parker we are already familiar with, it introduces and implements something unique and its own. The story itself blends just enough high-school pettiness and superhero shenanigans to make it a healthy balance so Peter Parker's purpose as Spider Man remains dominant. The problems I had with it, if any, was its reluctance to deal with the consequences of Parker's often reckless actions. <br/><br/>Each character, namely Parker and the villain, Toomes, are developed near perfectly so both's motivations and intents are clear. It is easy to sympathize, or at least empathize, with both of these figures forced to extremes by a continually evolving world. Toomes is an everyman with a general hate for the rich and powerful, Parker is a superhero wannabe trying to please a figure of power and wealth. And the side characters have character, but not enough to control the story or completely steal the spotlight from these two. <br/><br/>The film in terms of physicality is what you expect from Marvel films. Usually compelling visuals that often propel the story to higher standards. It may not hit you immediately, but the music, lighting, visuals, and cinematography all play a crucial part in delivering the emotion for a scene. <br/><br/>In conclusion, Spider-Man: Homecoming, while an imperfect film, is preferable to prior interpretations. The acting is superb, the plot viable, and all other mechanisms equally convincing. <br/><br/>9/10<br/><br/>90% (Fresh)<br/><br/>A"

","While going for the movie, I had my reservations with regard to the content after all there has been 4 before this. Whether it would be the same mundane Spidey web slinging of roofs that we've got used to now. But I was baffled by the cool, funny twist that felt so fresh. The portrayal of spider-man is so real,and for instance its actually a teenager and looks and feels like one, a fresh take from the previous version. Ah and who can miss Tony Stark(Downey Jr.) he fills the screen and is in top of his game as usual, this time stepping into the shoes of a mentor. Aunt May(Marisa Tomei) and Vulture too bring out the best performances that grips you. The movie deals with all the aspects of being a teenager in high school. The director Jon Watts has done a great job, the special effect are up to the usual standards of Marvel but the writing which brims with humour just takes it into the next level.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire was pretty good, Andrew Garfield was okay, but our new neighborhood spider-man Tom Holland is exceptional.

","Since it's a reboot, we already know the story of how spider-man gets its power, thus this was a move that the time can be used in the formation of plot. Second clever move was a young spider-man. The movie is all about a school going superhero as suggested by the name. The limits of spider-man are observed for the first time and why is he considered an underdog in the MCU is also reasoned in the movie. As I say how Hollywood is getting more mature every-day can be scene that the emphasis was not on a VFX treat but on the story, Tom Holland as a learning spider-man was brilliant. There limited space for Michael Keaton and he justified it."
"mymtproject","8","1","5","19 July 2017"," Diary of a teenage superhero
","I wanted to write this while my thoughts were fresh from having watched ""Spider-man: Homecoming"" at a late showing on Tuesday.<br/><br/>It was a fun experience and I like how SONY-MARVEL wove Spider-man into the greater MCU and still retained his own story. It started with his appearance in ""Captain America: Civil War"" and continued from the end of that movie. We get to see the boy behind the mask and how the thrill of having teamed with the Avengers affects his feelings about his powers and his place in the world, all this while he's still trying to be a teenager with a teenager's attitude and issues. More than anything, I'd say it's a movie about growing-up and growing-into a superhero. Tony Stark adds a nice touch as Peter Parker/Spider-man's sometimes mentor as we watch the web-slinger make some rookie mistakes in his zeal to impress Tony. There's some great interplay between the two and with Tony's assistant, Happy Hogan. We also get introduced to Peter Parker's day-to-day life in high school and his interaction with best friend Ned and fellow classmates Liz, Michelle and Flash Thompson. I really like how they fleshed out these minor but important characters in Peter's formative world. Then there is Adrian Toomes - the Vulture - who is given depth as the villain. Michael Keaton does a fantastic job making Toomes a sympathetic, albeit dangerous baddie. The movie is well paced, entertaining and family friendly. You get to watch Peter mature as a person and see Spider-man mature as a hero. I look forward to more collaborative efforts between SONY and MARVEL. They got a home run at best and a triple play at the least. Go see it!"
"lmafreak","7","1","5","19 July 2017"," Funny teenage movie.
","Well, I always loved the Sam Raimi trilogy and hated the Amazing Spider-man. But this one is a very good one. It is a really funny teenage movie, filled with young people and jokes. The bad guy is not that bad after all, and it is funny to see a young avenger ascending to success.<br/><br/>-Negative stuff: first off, no spider bite, no uncle Ben, and no back- story at all. We can also feel that the avengers actors were too expensive to pay for a cameo in the movie, so we just have captain America on the TV and a little bit of Tony Stark. -Cool stuff: Young aunt May, funny characters (especially Ned, Peter's BFF). And a bunch of silly jokes that will always make you smile.<br/><br/>Don't expect any curse words or blood like in Deadpool or Logan, it is a family-friendly movie, but one to watch. It's a lot of fun."

","Spiderman series is among the most celebrated franchises in Hollywood and has managed to create a dedicated fan following for the character among youth in particular.The news that Marvel has signed a contract with Sony to hitch up Spidey to their league of superheroes was a bit of a surprise,but I personally felt that the move was rather a much needed one for the revival of the series of which the penultimate offering ""The Amazing Spiderman 2"" was the weakest among the lot.<br/><br/>Positively,with ""Spiderman Homecoming"", marvel has succeeded in giving a high school drama's tint for the spiderman franchise without losing the soul of the series -whatsoever.Notably,spidey's character portrayed by Tom Holland is true to the spirit of the original comic series and more relatable on comparison with one's portrayed in other films in the series.<br/><br/>A perfect balance has been maintained between a Spiderman spin-off and a Marvel helmed superhero film and the presence of Tony Stark as Spidey's mentor and references to Avengers were all handled well by John Watts and his supporting crew who succeeded in making an engaging film with only few loopholes in the narration.<br/><br/>On the negative side the 3D effects were mediocre and the climax portions could have been more thrilling of sorts.<br/><br/>Overall,Spiderman Homecoming is a neatly presented rework of the original comic series that's worth a watch from the big screens near you !"

","I finally saw this tonight was looking forward to it ever since I heard about it and when I saw the trailer I was even more pumped for it and I was not disappointed this was a pretty good movie I really did enjoy it Tom Holland was the perfect Peter Parker/Spider-Man I didn't like the fact how he never really did anything about his love interest though I mean he asked her to the homecoming dance then left her there that was about it but he was great as the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man for sure and we did have your side characters like Flash,MJ except this time her name was Michelle not Mary Jane I'm kind of fine that they changed that the girl was this loner didn't have any friends but later on kind of made some she was a pretty awesome character and Peter's love interest Liz was great but the character I was most surprised about was Marisa Tomei as Aunt May I didn't expect her to be that great but she was amazing I thought I'm glad they went for a younger actress this time...I also liked the villain Adrian Toomes/Vulture which also turned out to be Liz's father which I was not expecting that was a shocker for me and Tony Stark was great as his mentor kind of prepping him to be in the Avengers he offered him a place closer to the end but he turned it down also there was a scene on a ferry that kind of reminded me of one of the other Spider-Man movies. The Amazing Spider-Man was good for the Spider- Man origin story but this movie was great because of Tom Holland he is definitely the best Spider-Man I was glad when he made an appearance in Captain America Civil War I was excited because he finally would get to be in the Avengers but it was just one mission and was hyped to see more of him and was really satisfied I can't wait for the sequel give this a 9/10 highly recommend it this is better than The Amazing Spider-Man 1,2 and Raimi's Spider-Man Trilogy altogether although the origin story in The Amazing Spider-Man was great but this movie is better Andrew Garfield is not the best Spider-Man to me he's second best."
"jboothmillard","8","1","5","15 July 2017"," Spider-Man: Homecoming
","Tobey Maguire came first and pulled it off, Andrew Garfield came second and sort of took it backwards, then finally the web-slinging hero made his debut alongside the other Avengers in Captain America: Civil War, so of course he would get his new solo movie soon after, expectations were high. Basically following the Battle of New York, Adrian Toomes (Michael Keaton) and his salvage company are contracted to clean up the city, but the Department of Damage Control (D.O.D.C.), owned by Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), takes over the operation. Before being stopped, Toomes and his team scavenged Chitauri technology, enraged being out of business, Toomes persuades his employees the keep and use these to create and sell advanced weaponry. Eight years later, Stark drafts Peter Parker aka Spider-Man (The Impossible's Tom Holland) into the Avengers to help with an internal dispute, but following the airport fight, Stark does not feel Parker is ready to become a full Avenger, so Parker resumes his studies at the Midtown School of Science and Technology. Parker quits his school's academic decathlon team to spend more time focusing on his crime-fighting activities as Spider-Man. One night, Parker prevents criminals robbing an ATM, using their advanced weaponry, after which he returns to his Queens apartment, where his best friend Ned (Jacob Batalon) discovers his secret identity. On another night, Parker nearly drowns intervening in a business deal, where Toomes' associates Jackson Brice aka Shocker (Logan Marshall- Green) and Herman Schultz (Bokeem Woodbine) are selling weapons to local criminal Aaron Davis (Donald Glover), Stark as Iron Man rescues him, he has been monitoring him with the Spider-Man suit he gave him, Stark warns Parker getting involved with dangerous criminals. Toomes accidentally kills Brice with one of the advanced weapons, Schultz becomes the new Shocker, Brice left behind a weapon, Parker and Ned study it and remove its power core, Parker rejoins the decathlon team as they travel to Washington, D.C., with the real agenda to follow a tracking device on Schultz, leading to Maryland. Ned and Parker disable the tracker Stark implanted in the Spider-Man suit, while Parker unlocks its advanced features, with the help of A.I. voice Karen (Jennifer Connelly). Parker tries to stop Toomes, as the Vulture, in a technologically advanced mechanical flying suit, from stealing weapons from a D.O.D.C. truck, but Parker is overpowered and trapped inside the truck, causing him to miss the decathlon national tournament. Parker races to races to the Washington Monument when he discovers the power core is an unstable Chitauri grenade, it explodes and traps Ned and their friends in an elevator, Spider-Man evades the authorities and saves his friends, including his fellow classmate and crush Liz (Laura Harrier). Returning to New York City, Spider-Man confronts Davis, who reveals Toomes' whereabouts, Parker is able to capture Toomes' new buyer Mac Gargan (Michael Mando) aboard the Staten Island Ferry, but Toomes escapes and a malfunctioning weapon tears the ferry in half, the passengers are saved with the help of Iron Man, but Stark is angered by Parker's recklessness and takes away the Spider- Man suit. Parker returns to his high school life, and eventually asks Liz to the homecoming dance, on the night of the dance he is shocked to discover Liz's father is Toomes, he in turn deduces Parker's secret identity, he threatens retaliation is he interferes with his plans. During the dance, the Avengers Tower is being emptied ready to move to the new headquarters, Parker realises Toomes plans to hijack a D.O.D.C. plane transporting weapons from the tower. Parker dons his old homemade Spider-Man suit, he is ambushed by Schultz at Toomes' lair, he defeats him with the help of Ned, Toomes then destroys the building's support beams and leaves Parker to die. Parker escapes the rubble, intercepts the D.O.D.C. plane, causing it to crash near Coney Island, Parker and Toomes fight, it ends with Parker saving Toomes from his own unstable equipment, he is left for the police, along with the plane's cargo. In the end Liz moves away after her father is arrested, Parker is invited by Stark to join the Avengers full time, he declines, but Stark returns his Spider-Man suit, Peter's Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) walks in just as he is putting his suit on., while in prison Toomes purposely denies to Gargan that he knows Spider-Man's real identity. Also starring Jon Favreau as Happy Hogan, Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts, Zendaya as Michelle, Tony Revolori as Flash, Tyne Daly as Anne Marie Hoag, Kenneth Choi as Principal Morita, Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America and Stan Lee as Gary. British actor Holland proves the perfect choice to play the spirited and wise-cracking hero, Keaton does well as the villain, Downey Jr. is good supporting the lead hero, and there is good support from Tomei and Favreau, I think Zendaya deserves the biggest mention, brilliant comic relief as the hilariously snidey classmate. The story is clever, connecting the Avengers movies seen previously, there is no need to go into a Spider-Man origins story, it just gets straight to point, where the hero is trying to prove himself and save people whenever possible, and the special effects combined with exciting set pieces are fantastic, a most impressive superhero fantasy action adventure. Very good!"
"jaceodemedici","10","1","5","14 July 2017"," One of the great Spider-man films
","This movie was great.<br/><br/>I have heard a lot of nit picky things about it and there have been a lot of people saying that this movie isn't as good as Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 2. Firstly, I'm not sure if I agree with that, I recognize the greatness of that film but I felt that Homecoming was more joyful, playful and grounded. My second complaint with that criticism is that this is the FIRST Spider-man movie in this trilogy and not the second. People seem to forget that the first film has to do the heavy lifting to get you invested in these characters and then, ideally the second film can go off and be less restrained by all the setup and just tell a better story (not that that has been the case for most of the MCU movies thus far, Iron Man 2, The Dark World, Age of Ultron). <br/><br/>I thought Tom Holland was great, some people said he sounded whiny, those people are probably a**hats. Jacob Batalon was just incredible all the way through, the scene in the library just caps it off brilliantly. <br/><br/>I loved the echoes of the civil war comic book arc at the end with the Iron-Spider suit and Peter declining the press conference.<br/><br/>I've also seen people complain about setting up future characters and I recognize that we've been burnt by that in the past, but I don't feel that this movie is guilty of the same sins as previous films and I think that some people need to ease up on the post- traumatic-bad-movie-disorder. This movie did not forget to be a good film first as Iron Man 2 did, and all of its character setups were really just playful winks that worked really well for me, as the many winks and easter eggs in the previous MCU movies have in the past. <br/><br/>I don't have a problem with all the MCU people and concepts that get thrown into the movie either, after all, this film takes place in the MCU and adding those things in just makes the world feel like something that we are getting a glimpse of whenever we go see these movies. One of my big complaints the first time I saw The Winter Soldier was that Tony Stark seemed to have no interest in knocking those helicarriers out of the sky, and presumably what's happening is on his radar in some capacity, so he should (not that I wanted him in the movie, but it did take me out of the film a little. In hindsight, it is one of, if not the best MCU movie to date). <br/><br/>All we can do now is hope that Sony doesn't f**k up Venom, of course, it's all but sure that they will."
"joshualawrencepike","8","1","5","14 July 2017"," A very good movie with a few minor problems
","I liked the first two Spiderman movies (although I don't think they aged very well) I did not like the latter three (although not all for the same reasons). I do like Spiderman as a hero. His powerset is in that sweet spot between ""Not as good as seal team 6"" and ""Can't be threatened"". It also lends itself to taking people captive rather then killing them, the writers don't have to come up with convoluted reasons why he does not kill. <br/><br/>Very minor spoilers ahead<br/><br/>That background out of the way I really did like Spiderman: Homecoming, much more then any of the other Spiderman movies. It does not waste time with much of an origin story, nor should it. I certainly do not need to see yet another Spiderman origin story movie. They also had Peter act and look like a real teenager. He made some big mistakes, as you would expect. But he did mean well, and he did learn to be better. As you can't fail to know by this point Iron Man is in the movie. Beyond the sheer joy of seeing Tony Stark chew the scenery, we also get to see him be the responsible adult. But most importantly he was in the movie what I would consider an appropriate amount. He did not steal the thunder from Spiderman. All the really important fight scenes he was absent for good plot reasons. In a lot of ways it's more like the Netflix marvel series then the MCU movies. The bad guy was not acting like a comic book bad guy who was trying to get revenge or take over the world. He was just a black market dealer trying to support his family (not saying he was a good guy, he was still a murderer). He was very careful and I could believe that he could go eight years without being caught. <br/><br/>While good there were still two things that I think held the movie back: The first is that he had no spider sense. His super agility plus spider sense are what really sells Spiderman to me as a hero who can play in the big leagues. Without it I find it harder to believe that he can dodge bullets and such. The second are the teen antics, I came to the theater to watch Spiderman, not a teen rom com. While to both Peter's and the writer's credit Peter does not take look to take school seriously when compared to this outings as Spiderman it still drags the movie down slightly.<br/><br/>www.JoshuaLawrencePike.com"
"ustheman","9","1","5","13 July 2017"," Street Lvl Super-Hero
","Going in with not too much expectations. From the trailers it looked like another typical summer blockbuster, Average cgi, unknown cast members plus adding to the fact it was a 2nd or 3rd attempt in rebooting the Spider-Man franchise. <br/><br/>This movie certainly exceeded expectations. This was a totally different marvel movie. It was scaled down, from a super hero perspective. It showed Spider-Man as young high school kid. More street level super hero, none of the city/planet saving hero you seen from iron man films or Thor etc. This added to the freshness off the marvel universe. <br/><br/>Acting was great, story was decent, sound design was brilliant. The most fun id probably had in a marvel movie. Where it let me down was the Spider-Man suit. In some scenes it just looked liked a Video game and some looked majestic. The inconsistency mixture of the CGI suit just didn't feel right. Kind of reminded me of that Ryan Reynolds movie. <br/><br/>Acting: 10/10 (Hands down best Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Goofiness and clumsiness matched with the youthfullness of his age presented. His age also played part of the story. Michael Keaton as the Vulture was perfect. The modernization of the character fit well with the movie at same time giving him little touches to respect the comic book look. The supporting characters weren't over done, there weren't any forced comedic moments that made your eyes roll).<br/><br/>Action: 9/10 (Scaled down a lot compared to other marvel movies, no big massive explosions, no collapsing buildings, property damage was kept to minimal but at the same time there was lots of action sequences, beautiful shown as well).<br/><br/>Sound: 10/10 (sound design was the best out of all the marvel movies. The team behind the sound mix deserves an Oscar. If you have the luxury to experience this film in Dolby Atmos then please do. The modernization of the classical spidey theme fit perfectly with the film shown).<br/><br/>Story: 5/10 (Story wasn't much to be honest. It was enough to make a movie but nothing too great. Basically this movie was a tribute to marvel fans that Spider-Man is back in the same universe as iron man and Co).<br/><br/>Nostalgia/Feels: 8/10 (Spider-Man always have feel good moments. This had plenty and had a good ""take home message"" which didn't feel overly clich√©d).<br/><br/>Over all average rating of 8.4/10"
"OlieRendch","9","1","5","13 July 2017"," A really great Spider-Man movie from beginning to end with Michael Keaton being a huge highlight.
","So here we are, the third reboot of Spider-Man, the sixth modern Spider-Man film, the sixteenth entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. What can I say? It's actually really great! I enjoyed Spider-Man: Homecoming a lot, right from the opening all the way to literally the end of the credits.<br/><br/>We saw Tom Holland's Peter Parker in Captain America: Civil War and there I wasn't too sure on him, he was very different from the film Spider-Men I was used to in Toby Maguire and Andrew Garfield but here in Homecoming I really enjoyed him. And it's his difference which is what I now enjoy about him, he really felt like a kid in school and even though we don't see his origin, he's still really new to this. Although I like the previous two adaptations, to different levels, it seemed only after a brief montage did Spider- Man suddenly become very skilled and professional, but here in Homecoming, you can see he's an amateur through the whole film, he makes mistakes, he bumbles about and I really enjoyed seeing that; so for me, Tom Holland is great in the role. Another cast member who was absolutely fantastic was Michael Keaton; his portrayal as Adrian Toomes was so intimidating, never mind as the Vulture, that he is up there with the better Marvel villains, which of course is a common criticism of these films. He really had a lot of great scenes and some very suspenseful ones. The supporting cast was entertaining enough, Peters friends at school were some familiar archetypes but enjoyable ones and Zendaya delivered some lines that made me laugh. Robert Downey Jr. didn't appear as much as many feared and his number of appearances felt just right for a film about Spider-Man.<br/><br/>Story-wise, I enjoyed a lot; the Vulture had really logical reasons for his actions and Peters arc was well-done with some quite dramatic and emotional scenes. The humor wasn't forced and I'd say the majority of the jokes landed for me. There were plenty of easter eggs and references and actually some of the nods to previous events really felt like you were part of large Universe and it was nice to see how the general public, as it were, viewed the Avengers, similar to how Ant- Man was a smaller-scale story and the villain wasn't looking to take over the world, it's the same here, a nice normalised perspective on an enormous Universe.<br/><br/>If I had to pick faults with the movie, I'd say one or two bits of dialogue were very expositional in the way of not really needing to be said, and also Spider-Mans suit was a bit Iron Man-like which makes sense in the context of the film but I'd be happy if they did away with the JARVIS-type AI and the heads-up display.<br/><br/>In the end, you probably can tell I really enjoyed Spider-Man: Homecoming and it's up there with the best of the MCU franchise."
"pdmajumder","9","1","5","13 July 2017"," Simplicity and strength
","Spiderman: Homecoming is a very aptly named film. ""Spiderman"" brings expectations of action and superhero-ness while ""Homecoming"" is indicative of a more down-to-earth, familiar teen comedy tone. This film is a smooth blend of the two genres. You come to know this right at the beginning of the movie where some scenes from our hero's past experiences play out as a part of a video log that he is making, in a very home-movie like fashion.<br/><br/>Spiderman, after his stint with the broken-up Avengers finds himself wanting to be called back in to the team and receive the kind of importance he thinks he deserves. In the meantime, he gets involved with a seemingly local issue with mysterious people yielding other- worldly weapons. This makes for a good number of action sequences but also provides ample space for humor. If you thought GotG was funny, you're in for a treat. In almost every single scene in which we're shown the normal high school life of Peter Parker, there's a sprinkling of comedy. From Peter's nerdy high-school bestie, Ned to his aunt May, everyone gets a portion of those lines.<br/><br/>The new Peter Parker is a typical teenager who's undeniably sweet but who also succeeds in fulfilling the great responsibility *wink* of a superhero whenever it's required he do so. Tom Holland's version has qualities from both the previous portrayals‚Äîthe awkwardness of Tobey Maguire's Spiderman and the comic timing and wit of Andrew Garfield's. The casting is spot on.<br/><br/>Some parts of Spiderman's story that we're familiar with from the earlier franchises are left out and with good reason. No one wants to see the same old storyline repeated. There is a fresher take on the plot with more involvement from newer characters that were not present in the other Spiderman films. The story is a very personal one to our lead, showing us all his capabilities and his process of growth. It focuses on even the smallest of things in his life like how he accidentally ""webs"" a person trying to open his own car (thinking he's a thief) and how that ensues a banter amongst the neighboring homes occupied by the elderly (no points for guessing who makes a cameo, here). Somehow none of it feels out of place in the least. <br/><br/>It is quite like any other Marvel movie in certain ways but also different because it is more stripped down, on the whole. The villain, Vulture, isn't very threatening initially or even someone who would have ended up being a very intimidating character had it not been for the circumstances, he found himself in. But after the intermission, the story goes into combat-mode. The motive makes sense and so does the struggle of our young lead in trying to balance two very different spheres of life. Interestingly, Vulture's backstory has roots in one of the earliest MCU films. There is a twist as usual towards the end; nothing too wild but something that puts Peter in a very difficult situation. <br/><br/>The future of Spiderman isn't very clearly stated but knowing how he's going to be in Infinity War, we can guess. There are two scenes after the movie ends and it is recommended that you stay till the end of the credits for the post-credits one (sooooo important) :P .<br/><br/>A small part of the movie, towards the end, seemed slightly loosely plotted where Peter was trying to save some valuables of Iron Man's, simultaneously fighting off the Vulture too. This kind of a situation should never have arisen as Iron Man's possessions should not be ones that can easily be plundered.<br/><br/>Some people might also think Peter Parker's character should have been a more serious, responsible kind of person. But he is significantly younger in this film with not as much of a traumatic past as the other Spiderman depictions. We just have to accept the fact that this version is away from the usual and has different goals to accomplish as it is not the first film of a standalone trilogy but instead, a movie that is a part of a much bigger and complex universe. <br/><br/>Every once in a while we need a break from the stress of the universe potentially ending to go back to the basics. This film achieves that purpose splendidly while also giving us a story that is important for us to know the character better. We'll have a lot of the craziness in Ragnarok anyway, I expect."
"jeannefrancoise","7","1","5","5 July 2017"," Fresh, young, and really funny Spiderman
","Dear readers, yesterday was the first day of screening of Spiderman: Homecoming in my home country, Indonesia. For Indonesian people, the figure of Spiderman has been becoming a symbol of young, brave, and honest superhero, other than Batman with its political conflicts or Superman with its science fiction method. For us, Spiderman is like the representation of a real hero in the society. Spiderman is not rich like Batman, nor having inter-galaxies power like Superman. Spiderman is a college student, being bitten by miraculous spider, and then becoming a hero during nights. Now in 2017, Spiderman movie is back and we are so excited to watch it. Firstly because of the title with the word ""Homecoming"". This makes people curious. ""What happens to Spiderman?"", ""Why he needs Homecoming?"" or ""What is Homecoming itself?"". So here it is my review!! Spiderman: Homecoming is the story about the Spiderman at the age of college student, young, beauty, clumsy, confused, narcissist, and other characters linked to a college student. Those characters make this movie really fresh and give some fun to the watchers. The next critical point is some physical appearances of Tony Stark (Iron Man) and Avengers team. For those who are not following the Avengers so intensely, maybe would be confused what is the link between Spiderman and Iron Man. The other thing that maybe the Director want to show us, is the plots concerning to illegal business or black markets within superhero equipment. That movie's plot is quite new and intriguing fact that a hero always needs a modern and updated thing also in the modern globalization time, including online videos. Too many good points to be judged for this movie, but for me, the minus point is only the action of Spiderman. He is everywhere in the movie, of course, but his actions are not so cool like Toby Maguire ever did. Well, but yes, I still recommend this movie since you will know the young face of Mary Jane :) Happy watching, Spiderman fans!!"

Not only is Tom Holland a great choice for Spider-Man, but he rings more true to his comic book counterpart. <br/><br/>This movie is not only charming, but hilarious. Combining the combination of humor, action and heart that we've become accustom go with Marvel films. Not to mention that Michael Keaton plays one of the best Marvel villains we've seen on screen with a backstory and motive that can make you almost sympathize with him. In my top five MCU films, see it if you haven't gotten the chance to yet."
"kane_1371-117-231060","6","1","6","9 May 2018"," Oh Spidey, stop it, you are killing me.
","This movie is all over the place with its cringe element, the gags are out of control, the tone is always changing, the story is trying too hard and is not really being genuine.
Another thing I picked up was that Homecoming Spiderman is the worst Spiderman ever. If he was to go toe to toe with Spiderman 1 and the amazing Spiderman 1 spidermen he would get destroyed.
Just imagine all they achieved in their first movies, and overall mastery they had on their skills compared to this one and not to mention this wasn't even his first appearance!!!
This all comes down to the way Disney execs and writers handled the character.
Peter Parker one of the strongest most intelligent heroes of Marvel universe was a slave to his suit basically (and yes it was also mentioned kind of in the story about how he was too reliant on the suit but that is basically just trying to dampen the impact of a damage already done.)
Peter Parker is a brilliant mind and here we didn't have the chance to get much of that because what we were constantly getting was the suit doing all the thinking for Peter.
Peter is dumbed down massively and that is sad.
When Peter comes in contact with Iron spider suit in the comics he at first is excited but soon realises that it is not who he is and leaves it behind for his normal suit, that alone shows how much of a different character he is to what Homecoming Peter is.
This is also very unfortunate as Tom is a great actor, he is very fun to watch and I can believe his sense of wonder and joy but the movie plot drags him down too much.
So all in all not really happy with the way the character was handled.
The story needed more work but the visuals that wins a lot of points from me, there are a few imagery easter eggs, as in shots straight out of the comic books and they are basically eye candy and just beautiful.
I expected a lot more out of this movie after all the gloating about the fact that Marvel was going to do a good spiderman movie unlike the older ones. But well I am not actually surprised."

","Why are detectives so funny to people? Firstly, let me acknowledge that I love Tom Holland as Spiderman. Captain America ""Civil War"" was great. <br/><br/>If you're going to do Spiderman, you either have to start small, from his beginnings, and dedicate a whole movie to that, or just make a movie assuming he already holds the mantle of superhero and have him solve a big mystery using his brains. More of Spiderman at the computer if nothing else. <br/><br/>I know this may remind some of the Spiderman and Friends cartoon, so if you're too cool for that I guess, then, well... So what.<br/><br/>This movie did not captivate me or anyone else. Who cares if Tom Holland is young. It would be that much more hilarious if he was a well- established superhero in New York City. Then, just when he thinks he has everything figured out, an alien craft is reported over the city. At first the sighting is a joke, but a week later people begin disappearing. Mutilated bodies appear in the streets. A strange creature called Venom is rumored to exist. Spiderman must fight him and then in the end he wins back the black Spidey suit in the most epic thing that has ever happened. Bitchin'.<br/><br/>""Spiderman: Homecoming"" was okay, but so dark in places, meaning there is an actual deficit of light, it was difficult to tell what was going on. I thoroughly enjoyed Michael Keaton as the Vulture. A step in the right direction, but I hope the creators of the latest Spiderman franchise aren't scared to step on a few toes in future movies."
"hanshotfirst-20216","9","1","6","19 August 2017"," Excellent Movie; Ranks Amongst the Best of the MCU
","Great movie! It successfully balanced drama, action, and humor. Most of the jokes, while predictable, are hilarious (especially the post-credits scene, which is too good to spoil). The action sequences, while slightly overstuffed, are excellent, and while this movie uses a ton of CGI, it is good CGI. Performance-wise, all of the actors are excellent. Tom Holland is amazing as both Peter Parker and Spider-Man, showcasing Parker as a convincing ultra-geek/nerd and Spider-Man as having slightly more confidence than Parker, but still as a hero who is still convincingly inexperienced. The Vulture/Adrian Toomes is not the greatest movie villain as a character, but Keaton's performance as Toomes is the best performance of the movie, and quite possibly of the MCU. The musical score is excellent. I only have three points of criticism: 1. Flash Thompson is a proved jerk in the movie, but he does not have enough screen time for the audience to absolutely despise him. 2. Michelle does not have enough screen time to be anything but simply there. 3. There are too many villains, and their operations are too complex to be understood in a single viewing. Still, a great movie, and I would give it 9.5 or 9.75 stars instead of 9 if I could."
"yeolit","6","1","6","18 August 2017"," Teen angst and over-kind antagonist
","Contrary to most of the other 10/10 reviews I have seen on this site, I feel that the main character this time seems to be a spoiled brat who does not know much of the phrase that was popularised due to Spider-man: ""With great power comes great responsibility"", as we see him keep getting into incidents where he bites off more than what he can chew.<br/><br/>Yes, this is an interesting new take for the Spider-man series, a bit too interesting in fact. The personality and abilities of the Spider-man this time seems much more willing to initiate rather than to save, in fact, more than half of the major incidents were directly or indirectly caused by him. Not sure what's so interesting about watching superheroes cause trouble then end up having to clean their own messes, wait there's ultron as a great example.<br/><br/>The storyline is stale, and at one point I wonder why Spider-man does not seem to be in a situation so severe I start to worry for him, well this is due to overpowered and reliable allies turning up just at the right time and over-kind enemies leaving him to rest once he is unable to fight, only to find him counterattacking maybe 5 seconds later.<br/><br/>As fresh as this is compared to the rest of the Spiderman series, it is undoubtedly strange to see a superhero act as childishly as he did, like how a kid does stupid things to attract the attention of his/her parent. And not to mention all the teen issues out there, it almost feels like watching some American high school drama with wanna heroism as the topping instead of the other way round.<br/><br/>Characters wise, to be honest it is strange how the Asian actors are featured, but I'm not going to go in-depth into that. Just remember the discrimination of asians in some institutions as an example.<br/><br/>Well, all in all, it IS a marvel production after all, so it is overall a quite good film."

","In my honest opinion, this movie really captured the Spidey us fans know from the comics, mostly through the Ultimate series. This was by far the superior Spider-Man film.<br/><br/>To start off, Tom Holland was the perfect actor to tackle the role. I give him a lot of credit, because since of the late success of marvel movies, he really had a lot riding on this movie. I think he played the character better than both Tobey and Andrew, although they were amazing.<br/><br/>The plot and the villain were great, and the dialogue was very clever and funny. The visual effects, sound, and editing were all amazing. I think this was a fun Sci-Fi/Coming of Age story."

","The MCU has faced many challenges over the years, but the difficulty this time around was creating a successful reboot to a character we've seen portrayed by three different actors in a 15 year period. ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" unexpectedly holds its own and succeeds by not attempting to retell the origin story yet again, and by casting an actor who portrays both Peter Parker and Spider-Man in a very likable manner. Our hero is very much in training mode at this point, but the journey is fun regardless. Marvel can rest easy knowing they have created not just a fun Spider-Man film, but also a humorous coming of age tale revolved around a boy finding his place within his own circle all while being a superhero. #spidermanhomecoming"

","I made the mistake of watching Spider-man 2 (2004) a day before watching this. Regardless, this film is a blast. Hats off to the acting all around. I think the script was well written for what it wanted to do, introduce a bunch of new characters and world building; the problem is that didn't leave enough room to explore the awesome new villain, or flush out the action scenes with more tension. So yeah, this movie isn't the best Spider-man movie, I'll rank it the 3rd best behind those first two from the original series. I have a good feeling about the sequel because this film does a great job of setting things up and putting characters into place; considering this is the second reboot, they did a good job."

","With a new ""Spider-man"" (actor), as well as basically a whole new cast (apart from Iron Man cameos) I saw the new trailer for ""Spider-man: Homecoming"" and thought (despite being a fan of them): ""How are they going to drag it out now?"" Seems I was wrong. After years of ""Spider-man"" film adaptations, the origins have been redone by Andrew Garfield (2012) after they were adapted by Tobey Maguire, ten years earlier, with many of the memorable and interesting villains already being adapted. That's why I was glad to see no more origins. ""Spider-man: Homecoming"" is about Peter Parker trying to pair his social and superhero life together in the peak of adolescence. Meanwhile, Spider-man, his alter-ego/superhero identity, is trying to find his 'big break' in the superhero world, competing against a range of factors (e.g. school, love-life, age, etc).<br/><br/>This film is the 'in-between' of all the previous movies, with a fantastic and well-driven plot-line, and many comedic touches which lighten up the atmosphere. As well as numerous plot-twists, this ""Spider-man"" movie can only be topped by the epic action and battle sequences in which it follows."

I loved the part when the class was at the Washington Monument and the teacher asked if she was enjoying the monument. She responded by saying she doesn't want to ""take in"" something that was built by slaves. The teacher then says ""I'm sure it wasn't..."" but the security guard shakes his head and the teacher turns back to Zendaya and says ""enjoy your book"". That was really funny. <br/><br/>This movie shows Spiderman as a person who would help you no matter what, and will always do whats right, even if he has to break a couple rules to do so. <br/><br/>Great job to Marvel for making such a fantastic, must see movie.

","I've recently watched Spiderman Homecoming and as almost all Marvel movies, I really enjoyed, especially because of Tony Starks appearance in it, but also because of Tom Holland. To be honest, I've never seen a movie with him, but throughout the trailers and other clips I've seen of him, he seems like a great actor, which was confirmed in Homecoming. He's just incredible! The movie itself was pretty good, Peter Parker resisting to the barriers by Tony Stark, his stubbornness, because he was so sure about the vulture and his relationship with the girl, can't remember her name, though. One of my favorite scenes was, where Peter climbed at the ceiling in his room and Ned's watching him and says ""You're the spiderman"". But I didn't liked the final fight between Spiderman and the vulture, it was in my opinion too easy to defeat him. And the very end where Tony Stark offered him a membership in the Avengers and the new suit and how he denied that, because he thought it was a test. A good thing though was that Pepper Pots and Tony Stark probably married. I liked Michael Keatons performance of the vulture."

While the film comes off like a check-list of audience approval : universal international students (check); fat-kid side-kick (check); ubiquitous Stan Lee cameo (check) it also manages to be more fun and lighter than previous incarnations (and thankfully no need for an origin story!)

","For me the best Spiderman movie and right up there with the best of Marvel. The main reason for this. They've finally gotten a proper Peter Parker as well as a proper Spiderman. In my opinion they've never nailed Peter, always playing him too old. You've always had a school full of 30 somethings, but this time they feel and look like real teenagers (Garfield got the Spiderman part off to a tee, but not peter). Also though they've nailed the feel of the comics, they've not felt too burdened by them, allowing themselves to update things to reflect our times, perfectly portrayed by the update to the Flash Thomson character. In fact all the surrounding characters are excellent with particular kudos to Jacob Batalan's Ned. And also it has one of the most relate-able and strongest baddies so far in Marvel in Keaton's Vulture. Though you can't pass by the fact that he's making and selling weapons of, if not mass, at least major destruction to any tom, dick or harry, you can relate to how he feels betrayed by the system, and his speech to Peter about how the little people feed off the scraps of the big table does hit home a little. And the action, though not as spectacular as some of the bigger set pieces of previous films is perfect for the scale of this movie and is in at least one scene quite scary and moving at the same time. All in all it's a delight of a movie and it's nice to have a bit of a more personal, smaller scale story before we hit the really big bells and whistles stories we've got to come."
"alanahsurfchick","9","1","6","12 July 2017"," Best Non-Origin Story For Spidey By Far
","Tom Holland returns as Peter Parker/Spider-Man in his first solo outing. Following the events of Captain America: Civil War, Peter returns to his everyday high school life whilst juggling his responsibilities as Spider-Man. Wanting to prove himself worthy of becoming an Avenger to his mentor, Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Peter efforts cause him to stumble onto the criminal activities of new super-villain, Vulture (Michael Keaton). Peter must now battle this new threat and, along the way, he might just show everyone that even a teenager can save the day. In my opinion, this is the best non-origin story Spider-Man film so far. Even though it a part of the MCU and makes references to previous films, this movie doesn't use what's come before as a crutch. It tells its own story and avoids being little more than a set-up film. It also twisted in ways I was unprepared for and left my jaw slacken for several minutes after the twist had actually occurred. Tom Holland does an excellent job as both Peter and Spidey. His character loves the thrill of being Spider-Man, but struggles with being regular Peter Parker. He's a fun hero but he's far from perfect, which is what makes him relatable. The supporting cast are also add a lot of flair to the film, from Peter's geeky best friend, Ned (Jacob Batalon), to Peter's caring Aunt May (Marisa Tomei). Now, there are a couple flaws, like the film hardly making any references to Spidey's spider sense power. I also wanted a few more scenes of Zendaya's character, Michelle, a quirky classmate and friend of Peter's who has a sarcastic wit that I found rather entertaining. In the end though, Spider-Man: Homecoming was a fun film with enjoyable action sequences and an entertaining cast.

"pioneerlythere37","9","1","6","12 July 2017"," Surprisingly New, Fresh...and Thrilling
","Somehow, Spider-Man movies refuse to get old. ""Homecoming"" is the third reboot, and instead of more of the same, we get something completely new with Holland's MCU Spidey Guy.<br/><br/>What Works: ""Homecoming"" ponders and explores what it would truly be like for a young Spidey to coexist with a hundred other superheroes, and an Avengers team so well-established that all city-threatening major villain-caused disasters are nowhere to be found. A humorous montage displays a blissfully (and for Parker, despairingly) crime-free New York City, where the friendly neighborhood web-spinner has nothing to do but give old ladies directions and keep people from hijacking their own cars. Watts' third feature film succeeds in giving us a Hughes-like high school movie, and reminding us that superheroes are still humans. Where previous Spider-Man films have put emphasis on the ""Spider"" part, the six writers of ""Homecoming"" focus on the ""Man"" as we watch a rookie 10th grade hero still adjusting to his alter ego. Yes, whereas Garfield's and Maguire's Spider-Guys have quickly and smoothly adapted to their new powers, Holland's is incredibly clumsy, and utterly believable. The film continues the MCU tradition of clever, witty dialogue and all-around solid acting, and adds another worthy hero to the series. It pulls off being in the Marvel Cinematic Universe well without focusing on the rest of the universe, just the titular and understandable main character.<br/><br/>What doesn't work: The Vulture isn't exactly the best villain to start off the third reboot, and the writers aren't very generous with his amount of screen time. While there are a lot of good ideas to explore with his character, he seems to often be forgotten as the filmmakers have the time of their lives focusing on Peter's crazy life. For a better kick start to what is definitely going to be a wonderful series, I could have done with a more compelling villain. Granted, Parker has some memorable scenes with Keaton's winged megalomaniac.<br/><br/>In summary: The surprisingly new, fresh version of Peter Parker is abundantly welcome, and the amateur Spidey is likewise a novel experience. Swinging around with the duplicitous main character is truly thrilling, whether or not it lives up to some of the previous entries in the character's catalog.<br/><br/>Rating: 90.4/100"
"stilloopless1","Null","1","6","8 July 2017"," A Reboot that Works
",":Slight Spoilers Ahead:<br/><br/>After 2014's rather dismal The Amazing Spider-Man 2, I've been rather sour on Spidey and the thought of yet another reboot of the character/franchise. However, Tom Holland's brief, but strong appearance as the character in Captain America Civil War, along with the current trailers renewed hope heart that the web slinger will once again fly high in geeky esteem.<br/><br/>So very happy and relieved to say that Spider-Man: Homecoming is definitely a reboot that works. Hands down this movie is firing on all cylinders.<br/><br/>It's a young, fresh and a refreshing take on Spider-Man.<br/><br/>No time is wasted rehashing the characters' origin story from the beginning. There's a brief mention well into the story and we move on. Personally, the best part of this is not having to see poor old Uncle Ben kick it, yet again. Yeah, yeah. Great power, great responsibility. Yadda, yadda, yadda. This gem of a life lesson comes harshly, but organically.<br/><br/>This go around, the backstory is broader and focuses on placing Spider-Man in the Marvel Universe that we've already seen from The Avengers through Civil War, giving us the ""big picture"" as well as this particular film's framework. This integration technique is also quite successful in establishing Michael Keaton's character in the film, making him one of the best villains out there.<br/><br/>Characters/characterization. Yes, yes, YES! They did this one right all the way around. Returning characters are built upon, new ones are nicely established and fleshed out, old faves pop up enlighten, delight, and amuse. One of the best parts of Hollands' Peter Parker/Spider-Man is the back to basics of him being a kid, a kid with amazing abilities and potential, but a kid nonetheless. And all the baggage that entails, including being/doing something stupid, repeatedly, even for the right reasons. While things do get heavy/intense the weight of the world hasn't dropped on Peter's shoulders, yet so there's still a light hearted, even naivety about him that's been missing from previous versions. All of which leads to this movie being fun and entertaining from beginning to end. The excitement, awesomeness of getting to be a superhero is infectious.<br/><br/>Overall, the story is solid, relatable and gratifying. The characters/acting is terrific across the board. The balance of action/humor/heart/angst is perfect. Nice soundtrack. There are even some surprising twists and turns. And let's be clear, this is the coolest, most bad@$$ version of the Spider-Man suit to date.<br/><br/>Fill up your webs lingers and swing to the nearest theater to catch this one. It's a 10 and you need to see it on the big screen. And be sure to ration your drinks, there's an additional scene after the credits."

","Homecoming takes a refreshing approach as it takes time fleshing characters out instead of just relying on non-stop action. Let's start with our villain Adrian Toomes/The Vulture. He is probably the best villain in the MCU, there's more layers to him than you would expect. Previously made redundant, he decides to make money creating weapons from alien wreckage in order to sell on the black market. There is good chemistry between Parker and his friend who discovers his alter-ego in the first 20 minutes. They end up working together throughout and It makes for some good jokes like his constant questions ""do you lay eggs"". <br/><br/>School bully Flash Thompson isn't the physical buff anymore, he's just an annoying spoilt brat this time who verbally abuses Parker throughout, which makes more sense when you think about it. The love interest isn't Gwen or Mary Jane for a change and thankfully it isn't the focus here. Parkers heart is set on one thing, which is to become part of the Avengers. His Spider suit is equipped with cool hidden gadgets including a digital interface, a power shoot, web-wings, 200+ web-shooter modes and an ""instant-kill"" mode which will certainly please comic book fans. <br/><br/>As for the humour, it's lighthearted in the tone of the comics and it doesn't feel forced. The action doesn't quite reach the spectacle of other Marvel outings but as stated earlier, it's more character focused which makes it that much better. There are some stand-out set pieces worth mentioning, one includes a boat getting split in half, an elevator rescue and some exciting chase sequences. <br/><br/>However it can be CGI heavy at times, there is a particular twist towards the end that would have been better had it been revealed earlier and there are too many references to other MCU events/characters. For instance Iron Man keeps popping up every so often, there's mention of other events like the airport sequence from Civil War and the final battle from The Avengers. But as tedious as it gets, it does serve a purpose to the plot.<br/><br/>Nitpicking aside, Tom Holland is perfect for the role as he plays Peter Parker with a sense of joy and wonder. Part of the enjoyment is seeing him come to grips with his powers as he uses them for fun a lot of the time and in doing so, endangers civilians and those close to him. This is about him learning to use his powers responsibly. It will be very interesting to see how the next series of adventures unfold. Let's hope Marvel can come to an agreement with Sony to use Venom in their later projects."
"joshbarton15","8","1","6","6 July 2017"," Spider-Man is home.
","When it was announced that Spider-Man was coming to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the world went a little bit crazy because, you know, Spider-Man is arguably the most iconic Marvel character of all time. After his brief yet unforgettable appearance in Captain America: Civil War, the anticipation levels were sky high for his first solo film within the MCU and they couldn't have chosen a more apt title than Spider-Man: Homecoming.<br/><br/>Overawed by fighting both with and against some of the Avengers, Peter Parker (Tom Holland) tries his utmost to impress Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) with the hope that he'll be invited to join the team. Juggling the dual life of high school and superhero duties as Spider-Man proves harder than he first thought and when he comes up against Adrian Toomes/Vulture (Michael Keaton), who's created an array of advanced weaponry from salvaged alien technology leftover from past Avengers battles, he is put the ultimate test.<br/><br/>With Sony and Marvel Studios settling on joint custody of Spider-Man, the time has come for him to take his rightful place in the MCU, and thanks to Jon Watts' direction and a number of great performances, he well and truly settles in as if he's never been away. Understanding that the Spider-Man origin story has been done enough means that the film picks things up right after Captain America: Civil War, with Peter Parker having been Spider-Man for a while now and struggling to live life as both a high school student and Spider-Man.<br/><br/>The inevitable clash between the two lives is what really drives Homecoming forward as a film, the high school setting dropping us right into an environment the MCU hasn't explored before. It's here where Homecoming excels, Watts delivering plenty of funny and charming moments that wouldn't feel out of place in a John Hughes film like Ferris Bueller's Day Off, which gets a neat little visual nod here.<br/><br/>Homecoming possesses a number of action sequences that deliver their fair share of spectacle, which isn't unusual for the MCU however, they feel pretty run-of-the-mill which may come down to Watts' inexperience directing action. Watts seems more at home directing the more personal moments of the film, whether it be Peter and his best friend Ned daydreaming about girls or Tony Stark mentoring Peter in his duties as a superhero, and as I've previously mentioned, these are the moments where the film will make a connection with the audience.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Tom Holland may just be the best Peter Parker/Spider-Man there's ever been on screen. He captures the innocence of Parker, the cockiness of Spider-Man and the naivety of both extremely well to give the MCU another troubled lead. The supporting cast of those we see him interact him as both Parker and Spider-Man play their part in making Homecoming such a fun film, particularly Jacob Batalon as Ned, whose friendship with Parker is one of the major strengths of the film. The presence of Tony Stark/Iron Man is nothing to worry about as he's not in the film as much as the marketing would lead you to believe.<br/><br/>The MCU normally gets criticised for having weak villains but Michael Keaton's performance as Adrian Toomes/Vulture certainly bucks the trend. Keaton uses his facial expressions to great effect, creating an unnerving and psychotic presence around Toomes, particularly towards the end of the film. He's definitely up there as one of the better villains in the MCU so far, that's for sure.<br/><br/>With Spider-Man: Homecoming, Marvel Studios have brought Spider-Man to his rightful home with such a refreshing film. There's a few twists and surprises along the way, plus an end credits sting that has to go down as one of their most inventive and best yet. This film only raises my excitement for Infinity War more."

","So, Spider-Man reboot no. 2....<br/><br/>After seeing Tom Holland cameo in Civil War, a lot of promise was shown. He embodied the character of the nervous teen Peter Parker pretty efficiently. I was curious to see how they would expand on it in this film.<br/><br/>Well, needless to say, they did a pretty good job. It ties into the narrative from Civil War seamlessly and does very well exploring the story of Peter Parker, desperate to impress Tony Stark so he will become an Avenger. However, he's still in high school and must deal with the stuff that comes with that.<br/><br/>The villain of the piece is the Vulture, played by Michael Keaton. A salvage worker laid off after the events of the Avengers, he attempts to smuggle and steal as much alien/advanced tech as he can and manufacture enhanced weapons from it, as well as cause havoc in his mechanical wing suit.<br/><br/>Essentially the meat of the story is Parker trying to gain significance. Being babied by Stark frustrates him and he tries to get involved in preventing more serious crimes, only to be reprimanded by Stark. It's an good dynamic, and also Holland may be my new favourite Spider-Man.<br/><br/>So, it's a decent flick, although it does get bogged down by a lot of stereotypical high school scenes we have seen already from countless other movies. Social outcasts, bullies, love interests, popular kids having a party, etc. Also, the plausibility of the technology of Spidey's suit gets a bit ridiculous. I know Stark is a tech genius, but seriously, a spandex suit with JARVIS-like AI? I know it's a movie, but still...<br/><br/>Other than that, this film was very entertaining and was certainly a breath of fresh air after the previous installment of Spider-Man on film. (shudders)"

Of course, there was some parts at later time where he's a hero, but every scenes need to show he's a hero, and not Iron Man because this is about Spiderman, and not Iron Man.<br/><br/>To be honest, when I think of that fact, I couldn't even enjoy the film completely. But I must admit it's a great film if I didn't think about that fact. All in all, I will be waiting to see more of Spiderman being a hero and do the right things as he always does.<br/><br/>(P.S: My opinion ONLY.)"
"MovieTim14","7","1","7","24 June 2019"," A great Marvel film... but a so-so Spider-Man movie
","""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" occupies an interesting spot in the movie landscape. It's the 16th movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the grand experiment of interconnected movies involving Marvel's different superheroes. Unlike his heroic counterparts, however, whose only modern blockbuster films have existed within this universe, this is the web-slinger's third different big-screen iteration in recent memory. Although a solid entry in the MCU, it's when I try to reconcile it with the Spider-Man movies that have come before, such as the Sam Raimi directed ""Spider-Man"" films or the more recent ""Into the Spider-Verse,"" that ""Homecoming"" starts to falter a bit more.<br/><br/>Most of what works for ""Homecoming"" is that it adheres pretty closely to the proven Marvel formula for success. The focus is on its characters and tone. The characters are instantly likable and relatable. They ground us to the setting, which, in this case, features daily high school life as prominently as it does superheroics. This is a superhero movie in the vein of John Hughes. These aspects are bolstered by a great sense of humor throughout. Fortunately (in the sense that this is a more recent trend in Marvel movies), there is a great antagonist for our hero to go up against, and the whole conflict is accentuated really well by some genuinely surprising twists. Surprisingly, the action does not feel up to snuff for the kind of stuff Marvel usually churns out, with the climactic third-act showdown in particular feeling pretty muddled and unchoreogrpahed. As a film, there is nothing particularly outstanding about the shots and direction in general.<br/><br/>The best thing this film offers is a fresh perspective in relation to the rest of the universe. This is not a film about a billionaire genius, legendary super-soldier, or literal alien god, but rather more relatable, ""everyman"" characters who are making sense of living in a world occupied by those titans. This works especially well for our hero and villain, with Peter Parker desperately wanting to live up to this monumental legacy, while Adrian Toomes rises up in villainy because he feels the threat that such beings pose to regular folks like himself.<br/><br/>This perspective also proves to be a double-edged sword however, and the film's fatal flaw, at least if you are looking at the spirit of the ""Spider-Man"" character. It almost feels as if the film goes too small. Gone is the cinematic grandiosity that had become commonplace with Spider-Man films, no shots where we follow Spider-Man swinging through the streets of New York. Similarly, Peter Parker being an ""aww shucks"" type of character whose main motivation is to become an Avenger feels like a reduction of the three-dimensionality that usually makes his character so special. That arc is explored and resolved in a satisfying way. My point is that it feels like an inconsequential story for a character whose very origin involved learning that his choices have life or death consequences.<br/><br/>For these reasons, ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" walks a strange line. It's a better Marvel movie than it is a ""Spider-Man"" one. With its sequel, ""Far From Home,"" due to release in just a few days, and a likely continued and prosperous series beyond that, I can only hope that this iteration of the character can learn to walk that line a little more evenly."

"iNathanJagger","Null","1","7","26 August 2017"," The smallest thing could have given it a 10
","As I have watched all Marvel movies and will continue to do so leading up to Infinity War, I had high expectations for this movie - especially as SpiderMan 4 was cancelled and The Amazing Spider-Man 3 for stupid reasons but also with stupid plots to come in the movie. So Spiderman: Homecoming was going to be a show stopper for me, and it was! The humour was unimaginably good with perfect timings and getting to know Peter and Ned and the bad guy with all their intentions and lead ups and awkward moments in the movies, with the ending being shocking up understandable. The only downside for me is that we didn't get to know his friends around him, we understood Ned and Liz but everyone else we didn't get to know like I feel like we should of, Michelle we got to know a bit about with her mind and understanding, being the one whose quietly clever and understanding smart with her sarcastic comment, but I would of mind knowing where she got that sense of humour from and what else is her link to Peter and Ned because all we know is she sat alone with no friends on the same Table as then (Happily). Now Flash, he isn't a flash - is a Flash who wants to be mean but doesn't know how to, I feel like was a weak way of putting him in the movie as they didn't know exactly what to do to him and how to make him the meanie we know him to be. We know flash as a bully who picks on Peter the most because he can and has no excuse not to, and Liz as she is the equivalent of Mary - her and Flash have no connection and no relationship, for the time they are together I don't think they spoke to each other, just was in the same conversation but with aiming their talking at each other. It seems like Flash is Flash in the movie is because Peter does what he wants and doesn't give a sh** and Flash is jealous of it and fails to be jealous on the outside and get put down like you think the school bully should but it's a movie - he should be the bully who doesn't get done. Flash was a missed opportunity in this movie and I hope he gets a backbone in the next one and I hope we learn more about his friends/group in the next movie. Now Aunt May Parker, she is the wrong actor to play with character, we know her as an old women who is on the breaking point every day but keeps with the backbone for Peter even when he lets her down, even if The Amazing Spider man was a weak excuse of a Spiderman movie she still did the part - where as this Aunt May was young hurt and seemed like she grew a bit older since Captain America: Civil War. When we saw her they were short and simple lines and at times getting hit on by some guys around, but when she was upset Peter had to say a few words to make the attention go to him crying. I feel like when she was shown it was an easy way of pumping the movie length a bit longer, except Peter crying scene, but that could have been done way better than done. I still to this day will say the original Spider man film with the classic characters and plots was the best one, but this film just shows in part what both Spider Man and The Amazing Spider Man did well, and it shocking as The Amazing Spider Man for me was a waste of money that earned money."
"tomgillespie2002","7","1","7","26 July 2017"," Is a second reboot justified? Somehow, yes.
","Marvel fans rejoiced when the announcement was made that Cinematic Universe overseer Kevin Feige had managed to reclaim the movie rights to one of their most beloved and iconic characters, Spider- Man. Along with Bryan Singer's X-Men, Sam Raimi's Tobey Maguire- starring Spider-Man trilogy laid the foundations for the modern superhero movie and proved that comic-books aren't just for nerds. After constant meddling by Sony, Spider-Man 3 was a convoluted mess, and although it raked in the cash at the box-office, plans for a fourth instalment were put on ice. The plan was later scrapped entirely in favour of a reboot with Andrew Garfield, which was also cancelled after its sequel made the same mistakes that saw Raimi's Spider-Man 3 receive a critical mauling.<br/><br/>Marvel cast British actor Tom Holland in the role, and he was quickly heralded as the best Peter Parker yet when he debuted in last year's Captain America: Civil War, and Feige revealed that a standalone reboot was coming soon. The thought of a second reboot just 5 years after the last one naturally had people sceptical, but Holland's exciting cameo also raised hopes. While it certainly doesn't reach the lofty humanist heights of Raimi's Spider-Man 2 (still one of the best comic-book movies ever made), Homecoming - a title that works on two levels - is bloody good fun. Taking Parker all the way back to high school as an overeager 15 year old, with detention, hormones and the homecoming dance as much of a concern to our hero as the villain flying around with alien technology, the film shares just as much in common with the classic John Hughes movies of the 1980s than it does with anything starring Iron Man, Thor or the Hulk.<br/><br/>Having proved himself to Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) by stealing Captain America's shield and helping topple Paul Rudd's Giant-Man during the events of Civil War, Peter Parker now waits eagerly by the phone for a call from Jon Favreau's Happy Hogan to announce his next mission. Only Stark would prefer that he remains a friendly, neighbourhood Spider-Man for the time being, but Parker's eagerness to prove himself and struggle to truly control his powers see him taking on hardened thugs and barely making it out alive. On top of juggling his new responsibilities (thankfully we are spared the Uncle Ben speech this time around), he awkwardly courts the pretty Liz (Laura Harrier), receives abuse from rich douchebag Flash Thompson (Tony Revolori), and must prevent chubby best friend Ned (Jacob Batalon) from revealing his superhero alter-ego to the rest of the school. Ned quite rightly believes that the revelation is their ticket to climb the high school cool hierarchy, and Liz naturally has a crush on her local masked vigilante.<br/><br/>A world away from Marvel's previous supervillain Ego the Living Planet (no pun intended), whose masterplan spanned the entire universe, Homecoming's big bad is in the form of working man Adrian Toomes (Michael Keaton). Talking in a thick New York accent and favouring a baseball cap and a hoodie, Toomes is introduced cleaning up the mess left by Loki and his Chitauri army during the climax of 2012's The Avengers, only to watch as his contract is snatched away by Stark and his billions. He doesn't leave empty-handed though, as he manages to smuggle some alien technology away and form a lucrative, and highly illegal, arms business. He also has a formidable suit made for him, allowing him to soar through the sky on razor-sharp wings, dubbing him the Vulture. After a number of forgettable Marvel villains, Toomes brings to mind Alfred Molina's three-dimensional and incredibly sympathetic Doc Ock, and Keaton has fun with the role, proving a menacing presence during a particularly tense car journey on the way to the homecoming dance, in what is undoubtedly the film's standout moment.<br/><br/>The likes of Thor would be able to take out Toomes with the blink of an eye, but his family-first motivation and distrust of the rich and powerful ground the movie, and helps make Homecoming Marvel's smallest and most intimate entry since Ant-Man. While the climax does deliver a routine smash-em-up CGI fest that director Jon Watts doesn't seem experienced enough to handle, the film mainly avoids the usual superhero tropes and rarely shifts its focus away from Parker, who is played with irresistible charm and athleticism by Holland. There's an endearing playfulness in the smaller moments, particularly in the dynamic between Holland and scene-stealer Batalon. Having watched Watts's previous film Cop Car recently, it now seems obvious why Marvel placed so much trust in a director so clearly adept in handling young relationships. Homecoming continues the recent trend of proving that superhero movies don't necessarily need to be superhero movies: They can also be a high school comedy, or a violent western. Is a second reboot for a character only introduced to the big screen 15 years ago justified? Somehow, yes"

","SPIDERMAN HOMECOMING REVIEW : I'm a Spiderman Fan from childhood, old Spider Man films series (3 films) is still my favourite. The Amazing Spiderman couldn't match the class of that old Spiderman but i liked it for some advanced technology used in it. Now comes SpiderMan Homecoming, Another spidey film excited too much before release, don't know how but i started expecting Best Spidey film ever but this one too couldn't match the standard of Old Spiderman series.<br/><br/>Good Performances, Good Story, Excellent 3D Effects, Enough pacy screenplay but a disappointing Climax spoiled the film. Obviously, one expect breathtaking fight sequences in the end but here you don't see Hero fighting hard and beating Villain. Villain gets thrashed very easily, i mean come on man where is much expected Explosion? Where is Entertainment? Story is Good, Marvel keep making films on Avengers and Spiderman Homecoming script is suitable for MCU. Iron Man and Happy's presence is pleasing. You get to see Captain America's glimpse too (TV). Screenplay is Slightly slow paced in the first half then takes pace in second half but all goes in vain because of too simple climax. 3D effects are Excellent, this film must be watched in 3D only. Cinematography is very good, especially in Spidey's action sequences. Direction is on lower side, you expect more comedy, more entertainment, more explosion but director focused more on story and setting platform for MCU's upcoming films.<br/><br/>Overall, Spiderman Homecoming should be watched once to see advanced and technically updated version of one of the most loved superhero Spiderman. He does everything what an Avenger do, oh sorry Iron Man do. With better climax this film would've been better than The Amazing Spider Man but it failed. Go for this one, just don't expect too much, definitely don't expect too less, there's certain space between it to enjoy the film. 7/10* stars by me."

When I saw Spider-Man Homecoming I was amazed with what marvel did to make the movie a great movie. It was action packed with humour, action and tense moments. Tom Holland who plays Spider-Man was an amazing choice for the role. He plays Spider-Man outstandingly well and I don't think their could've been a better actor to play this Spider-Man role. There are some scenes that refer to the original Spider-Man trilogy which was great. When the movie finished I was quite sad to be honest because it was a great movie that contained outstanding camera work to make the scenes look amazing. It was an overall astonishing film and I would definitely recommend seeing it."

","I'm not going to beat around the bush so let's get to it. Spider-Man Homecoming was ""cute"". It's exactly what you take your toddlers to see and all is well. The problem is that this film was boring for the most part. I couldn't believe this was the same Spidey that kicked everyone's tail in Civil War. In this film he was clumsy to the point of ridiculous and he didn't improve much through the film til the end. Holland is a good Spider-Man but the script held him back. The saving graces were Stark, Happy, the talking suit, Aunt Mae and of course Michael Keaton. He stole the film. No way could this Spider-Man could have gone toe to toe with Keaton's Vulture. An interesting twist towards the end was so impressive no one saw that coming. Still it wasn't the Spidey I expected especially with his predecessors Tobey and Andrew. It was alright but not on par with any MCU films. 6/10. Bring on Black Panther!"
"regula1","8","1","8","6 July 2017"," After rocky years and a brilliant tease, a return to form for our favorite web-slinger
","We live in a golden age of superhero films, where we can have not only cinematic universes and iconic renditions of favorite characters, but also multiple iconic performances of the same hero.<br/><br/>Of course, as we well know, Spider-Man has had his up years and down years, so how does this latest visit from our friendly neighborhood web-head stack up?<br/><br/>Well, first off, Sam Raimi's trilogy of Spidey films defined a generation of fans, and after Tobey Maguire's brilliant performances (emo dancing not-withstanding) any actor can only succeed him, never replace. Andrew Garfield's two films, while they had their moments and he did an adequate job, just couldn't stand up to Maguire's legacy.<br/><br/>Now, in Tom Holland's first solo venture, we have a worthy successor.<br/><br/>We all wanted to see more after his brilliant introduction in Captain America: Civil War, and we got it. Set two months after the events of that film, Spider-Man: Homecoming finds Peter struggling to find his place in a world where he is considered a superhero but he's still a high school sophomore, with all the social awkwardness that comes with it.<br/><br/>Juggling between his high school friend Ned's incessant fanboying after he discovers Peter's secret identity (it was in the trailers), his neighborhood crime fighting turned serious with the appearance of Michael Keaton as Vulture, and his quest to gain approval in the eyes of Tony Stark, Peter Parker has his hands full, and he barely holds it together for most of it until finally things come to a head and we get what we all want from a Marvel film with the added bonus of it being a good Spider-Man movie. <br/><br/>It's only been twelve years since the last really good one!<br/><br/>In short, this film delivers on the patented MCU formula well, with a few twists. Mainly, that this is sort of an origin story without it being an origin story, and it doesn't rely heavily on any characters that were established in previous films other than Parker. Indeed, Tony Stark only appears in three scenes that lasted no more than ten minutes total.<br/><br/>While this film does have issues, mainly the fact that twists are fairly clearly telegraphed and some of the dialogue that is supposed to be purposefully on the nose for comedic value falls flat, they are minor compared to the overall product.<br/><br/>Spider-Man is back, and he is here to stay for a good while longer!"

","Kevin Feige has been doing a phenomenal job with the Marvel Cinematic Universe since the original ""Iron Man"" over nine years ago. All the movies have at the very least been serviceable and sometimes he even manages a real homerun like the Captain America series, ""The Avengers"", ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", and the aforementioned ""Iron Man"". The only Marvel superhero franchise that hit the same quality levels as the MCU is the original Spider-Man trilogy directed by Sam Raimi. Specifically the first two, though the third does have its strengths.<br/><br/>So, for years the very idea that Sony might loosen its grip on Marvel's most popular hero and allow him to enter the MCU seemed like a pipedream. In large part, the making of The Amazing Spider- Man franchise was a ploy to keep Marvel from regaining the Spider- Man rights back. Therefore, here we are. What masterpiece awaits us when the previous best superhero franchise joins forces with the current king of the superhero franchise? The answer is an entertaining teenage comedy with a superhero twist. It's not a great work of art by any means, but it was a fun experience. It does do two vital components: 1) it actually gives us a true to spirit version of Peter Parker, something missing in the Amazing series, and 2) it allows Michael Keaton to give us a mesmerizingly hammed up villain performance. Previous versions of the Vulture were boring, yet here he was probably the best part of the movie. This movie goes against the typical MCU mold of one-dimensional antagonist and gives us a compelling villain.<br/><br/>""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" is a superhero coming of age movie, reminiscent of John Hughes films from the 80s (though not as good as the best of those--then again what is?). Spider-Man is constantly forced to choose between being a kid and being a superhero. Being a superhero has a cost all its own since his exploits are filled with growing pains. Practically every Spider-Man adventure ends in either failure or clumsy victory. This is honestly the movie that Sony seemed to try (and fail) at with ""The Amazing Spider-Man"".<br/><br/>This is the best Spider-Man movie since ""Spider-Man 2""; however, when you look at the competition, that's an amazingly low bar to clear. As far as MCU movies in general, this is a middling effort. Honestly, probably not even quite as good as ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"". However, middling amongst the MCU is still fairly impressive overall. If you want to see a return to the Raimi era of Spider-Man, you'll be disappointed. But, if you're just looking for a fun movie, you'll leave contented."

","So, SM:H comes across with a breezy tone, snappy dialog and pacing, bright colors, and the normal technical expertise we expect from the Marvel Universe. If this were the first-ever Spider-Man movie, it would be pretty great.<br/><br/>But it's not. It's the sixth Spidey outing (or 7th if you count CA Civil War). And by this time frankly I've had more than enough of Peter's high school angst, webslinging, and predictable acrobatics without any accompanying depth to keep us more than superficially entertained. We've just seen it all before. Not that there aren't some good things about the production: Tom Holland (age 21) does about as well as you could expect putting across the persona of a puppy-eager, hero-worshipping, earnest but awkward 15-year-old. Michael Keaton is impressive as the in-your-face villain who can genuinely frighten. And Marisa Tomei gives us an Aunt Mae who's quite engagingly different from the previous versions by Sally Field and Rosemary Harris (which were also good).<br/><br/>But then we get a big dose of Tony Stark ... for me, this was a BIG mistake. Connecting Spidey up to the Avengers universe so closely is a strategic blunder. In reality (i.e. the actual comics) Spiderman always stood alone, had his own adventures, made his own mistakes, and followed his own learning curve complete with Gwen Stacey and Mary Jane Watson and all the rest. Now, Marvel has essentially turned him into Iron Man Lite with a suit that's just a junior version of the grown-up edition. Tony Stark runs the MCU and we're supposed to expect that everyone else will fall in line? (Does that sound politically familiar?) <br/><br/>But the worst thing is that if you look under the hood, there's not much there. It's all surface, and a lot of the time I found myself strangely just bored. Going to the theater to see SM:H pretty soon after seeing Wonder Woman was the biggest possible contrast you could imagine. In WW, the stakes were high, we could build emotional connections with the characters, and somehow things felt like they MATTERED. Some of the scenes moved people to tears -- did I see anyone reacting that way to SM:H? Not a chance. In this summer's sweepstakes, WW wins. It actually changed my standards for what superhero movies can be, whereas this Spider-Man is just a placeholder in the MCU."

","Spider-Man Homecoming is the web-head's first solo film since making his MCU debut back in Captain America Civil War (2016). I had high hopes for this movie, mainly because of Tom Holland's excellent Spider-Man portrayal in Civil War. Put it short, I was not disappointed. However, I did not love the movie and still prefer the original Spider-Man (2002) and Spider-Man (2004) over this newest edition. <br/><br/>Spider-Man Homecoming deals with a distressed Peter Parker (Tom Holland,) who is desperately attempting to please Tony Stark while balancing his complicated school life. When a villain known as the Vulture (Michael Kheaton) arises selling dangerous weapons illegally, Peter takes it upon himself to confront the conflict.<br/><br/>I think this movie got a lot of things right. It's the best on screen adaptation of Peter Parker as a nerdy, anxious school kid who can't exactly fit in. Tom Holland perfectly captures the 15-year-old geek persona. The film does a very good job of showing that Spider-Man is in fact a neighborhood hero, screwing up a ton but helping the little guys, rather than taking down a ridiculously powerful, world-threatening villain *cough* The Amazing Spider-Man *cough*. <br/><br/>The film is also very funny, but it also became an issue for me. Marvel seemed to make this movie a bit too fun, with lines of humorous dialogue spewing from characters' mouths every 2 seconds. Sometimes the humor hits, and other times it just falls flat. <br/><br/>Another problem for this movie is the pacing. Peter Parker is in his Spiderman suit for way longer than he should be, making the action scenes feel familiar and not special. You never really see many character relationships or arcs develop throughout the run time, mainly because so much screen time is devoted to him running around in his suit. <br/><br/>Although Spider-Man Homecoming had many good moments, I left the theater thinking ""meh."" It's a perfectly fun Marvel movie that didn't take many risks, leaving it nothing more than average."

He was called amazing in 2011 when Andrew Garfield played him in the first rebooted series, and finally even his second rebooted appearance in last year's Captain America: Civil War though short was in a word; incredible. Yes the ultra famous crime fighting spider has been through a lot.<br/><br/>In the latest reboot solo film he's back again with new blood Tom Holland, set several months after he fought alongside Iron Man in that infamous airport battle. Disappointed that a new reboot has appeared so soon? Well, don't be, this is the best Spider-man entry since 2004's Spider-man 2. Plus unlike the previous reboot, this isn't an origin story of Peter being bitten by a spider then gaining the powers. This is an origin story of him turning from Spider Boy to him becoming the Spider Man. It turns out that life for him isn't easy as fifteen-year-old Peter Parker is currently trying to balance his normal life as a high schooler, meanwhile fighting crime as his superhero alter ego Spider-man as a new threat...The Vulture (Keaton) emerges. <br/><br/>This terrifying villainous bastard is complete with a furry coat, night vision gear and metallic eagle-like wings attached to a jet engine - he's terrifying. Keaton is fantastic as this evil big beard, who terrorises New York with his clan of criminals carrying alien-like weapons. It's up to Spider-man to swing in and stop him; however he soon finds that this battle is no match for him. Keaton somehow gets a kick out of playing scary birds, as either Batman or Birdman. Here his eyes twinkle every time he appears on screen; he shows that he's a man enjoying his late career.<br/><br/>Holland's performance is fantastic, he shows to be the best choice here he's energetic, he's heroic and he's; well, hilarious, as Spider-man. As Peter it's a pretty stable match, the film uses him to his full potential as he tries to balance his, from his eccentric best friend (Jacob Batalon), his love life (Laura Harrier).His new mentor Tony Stark (Downey Jr.) is the solemn adviser, and he teaches Peter that being a hero isn't as spectacular as he thinks. <br/><br/>New director Jon Watts who also showed strength with his pretty good cop thriller Cop Car. He makes this the most promising web head film in years, his direction of the youngsters involved is brilliant, and his handling of the veterans such as Robert Downey Jr. and Michael Keaton is wonderfully adept. The family values here are somewhat left in the background, in the previous entries more notably the original trilogy his trusted Aunt May was used as his go to person for advice. Here she's barely used for this, though she teaches a couple of things, its Tony who gets the most interest. Which is essentially the film's main flaw. Still, the web head swings with clarity, his new suit is spectacular and his hero abilities could not be better done, this is the best he has ever looked. Spider-man: Homecoming is sweet, witty and fast moving fun. <br/><br/>VERDICT: He's back and he's better than ever. Swinging with joy in this spectacular most polished reboot, which is filled with fantastic and witty, web swinging fun."

","I always thought it was about time they did proper Spider-Man like he was originally in the comic and this is although not perfect is as close as we are going to get (for now), <br/><br/>They have learned their mistakes from previous poor incarnations by going back to basics and showing him like he was in the comic, a typical 15 year old teenager. The other thing I liked what they showed was his inexperience, unlike other Spidey movies where he looked as if he knew what to do as soon as he got his powers, here we see him landing badly, unsure of himself etc<br/><br/>Although I did think it was a bit slow to start off and took a bit get some momentum. Tom Holland although we got to see him briefly in Civil War seems to be perfectly cast as the Peter Parker we grew up reading. For me Michael Keation was brilliantly cast as the villain, literally stole any scene he appeared in and was able to portray Adrian Toomes in a way that the audience could sympathise with him. Robert Downey junior appeared just enough not to steal the movie away.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I felt Marisa Tomei was poor casting as May Parker (although she is stunning for her age), just felt she looked too young, as May is supposed to be a lot older & frailer.<br/><br/>The other thing I liked was we finally got to see who cleaned up the mess after the chitauri invasion In New York, and we finally get to see Damage Control on the screen.<br/><br/>Looks like Spider-Man's big screen future is in good hands, especially if the rumours about the upcoming Venom spin off is true.<br/><br/>#Thwip 'nuf said true believers"

","This was absolutely, without a doubt, the best ""Spider-Man"" movie ever! It's everything I loved about Spider-Man in the comics, cartoons, and video games growing up. It has his signature wisecracks, the fun thrills, and struggles of being a teen that Spidey is famous for. Michael Keaton gives a wonderfully chilling performance as the villain. There is one scene in particular that I won't spoil where his threatening demeanor is enough the frighten even a grown man. Spidey's tech-savvy sidekick also provides some wonderful comic relief. My one complaint was the actress Zendaya. She was so monotone and bored, that I was really starting to regret Disney buying Marvel at some points. (She was a Disney Channel star.) If she had put more emotion into her lines, or had been given better direction, she could have been a more interesting character, but she just came off as bland. I will probably have to watch this movie several times when it hits Bluray, because I spotted some fun little Easter Eggs and inside jokes, and I'm sure there were plenty more that I missed. As always, stay for the very end of the credits. I'm not going to spoil anything, but lets just say that Marvel is starting to become very meta....and that's all I'm going to say about that. It's too good and too funny to spoil.

"vjnambu","7","0","1","26 March 2020"," Spiderman under the shadow of ironman
","First things first, Tobey maguire will always be my favorite spidey and sam raimi's spiderman trilogy are my favorite superhero films. Due to which, I couldn't accept andrew garfield as spiderman. But I enjoyed tom holland's cameo in civil war, so I was looking forward for homecoming.
Homecoming is given a complete reboot. It doesn't focus on peter's origins and uncle ben stuff. Peter is a high school kid. Aunt may is a hot spinster and tony stark is his his mentor. After the airport battle in civil war, peter is waiting for tony stark's call on next mission. But tony instructs him to be only a friendly neighborhood spiderman. Adrian toomes known as the vulture is planning to steal essential weapons of stark tech. How peter stops him and impress stark is the rest of the film.
Tom holland fits perfectly as peter and spidey. In comics, peter was a high school kid and holland looks exactly like a teenager. His friendship with jacob battalon was a treat to watch. Michael keaton was impressive as vulture and his scene of threatening peter was worth mentioning. The typical humor in mcu films is abundant. Robert downey jr as usual was a treat in his extended cameo of tony stark. But we got to see less of action in him. The scene where peter tries to lift the wall rock gives goosebumps.
But i have three issues with the movie. First is peter's intentions. In original spiderman, peter's motive was with great power comes great responsibility. Whereas in homecoming, peter does stuff only to impress tony stark and join avengers. Second the film lacks emotions. Mcu films have comedy but also enough emotions too. Third is the unexciting action sequences which were mostly childish. Amazing spiderman series had much cool action scenes.
For 90s and early 2000s kids spiderman will be tobey maguire but for 2010s kids spiderman will be tom holland. In that case homecoming succeeds. But can't digest him being too dependent on stark."

This nicely meshes Iron man into the story as a mentor, and obviously sets up closer work for Spidey with the Avengers in the future.

"ronakkotian","7","0","1","25 July 2019"," A different take on Spider-Man
","WARNING: *SPOILERS*<br/><br/>Spider-Man: Homecoming was quite surprising. I didn't expect Marvel to take a route like this with a superhero like Spider-Man but I'm glad they did.<br/><br/>What I instantly loved about the movie was how relatable of a character Peter Parker was. We see his school life, his school crush and his normal life rather putting too much focus on the action scenes with Spider-Man. Peter Parker has a very innocent and awkward personality which connects the audience to his character and makes us want to root for him even more. In spite of this, some people may find the movie boring because of lack of action scenes and heavy focus on Peter Parker rather than Spider-Man.<br/><br/>The acting overall was solid. Tom Holland's portrayal of Spider-Man is very well done especially in a scene where Peter feels genuinely scared that he may die. The emotion given by Holland felt so real and suited his character perfectly. Michael Keaton as the Vulture was great to watch but I feel they could have developed his character a bit more. Jacob Batalon, who played Peter's best friend, was hilarious. A lot of his jokes land and reaction to finding out that Peter Parker is Spider-Man felt like how someone would react in real life.<br/><br/>The action scenes were fine but I kept on noticing how incompetent the direction was during it. The very last action sequence was a bit hard to see due to the shaky camerawork.<br/><br/>Spider-Man: Homecoming is a fun watch. I loved the new take on Spider-Man's character. Tom Holland gave a terrific performance and the lighthearted humour and action kept me entertained."

","Here's my review of spiderman : homecoming. So , Tom Holland was great as spiderman . He was funny , athletic and smart just like how you saw him in civil war. Michael Keaton was great as the vulture , even though he could have been a little more intimidating , not just the bad guy , the whole plot could've been a little dark , it was too cheesy , I'm not saying bad , but it was cheesy like its TV series . Some things which pissed me off , was how spiderman talked to the AI in his suit and depended a lot on stark tech , because spiderman talks to himself while swinging by and one of the original traits of his is not depending on tech except for his web shooters . The supporting cast was great too , especially the fat Asian dude . Aunt may was good in this movie , but more uncle Ben memories would have boosted the emotional drive , which was lacking in this movie. Iron man was cool , and he knew his place without crowding it. The music in this movie is really cool and that too how they did a remix to the classic theme song which blended really well with the action sequences. In the end , homecoming is a perfect summer movie with lots of cheesiness , web slinging fun and wall crawling action and perfectly timed one liners. Oh yes , there's a post credits scene and an end credits scene , the end credits scene however ... Just watch it ."

","A surprisingly solid MCU movie, Spiderman: Homecoming endearingly chronicles Peter Parker's hardship balancing the stresses of school life with that of embodying his perception of what it means to be a superhero; thus, we see him grow from a boy who relies upon others (Iron Man & his suit) in to a man, capable of standing independently on his own two feet, earning the title of the iconic web-slinger instead of it simply being gifted to him by everyone else.<br/><br/>Most impressively, avoiding the clich√É¬©d, two-dimensional villains Marvel usually features, Homecoming additionally has a morally ambiguous antagonist played by Michael Keaton who simply owns the role & genuinely unsettles as The Vulture.<br/><br/>For instance, there's a brilliantly shot, tense sequence set during a car journey where his understated performance threatens our friendly neighborhood protagonist more than any action packed battle could & the chemistry between the two was palpable which really helped drive the film forward with interesting, heightened personal stakes.<br/><br/>Furthermore, it's nice for the every-day world of the Marvel Cinematic Universe to be depicted, exploring how common, working class people are / have been affected by the events that take place through the phases - so to see the banality of life persist regardless was a pleasant touch & a reminder that such mundanity still exists, regardless of the whimsical absurdity. Yet another clever contrast to fuel the original narrative.<br/><br/>For a franchise so full of generic, unremarkable installments, this solo project ranks high amongst the rest & proves Feige still has a few tricks up his sleeve."

The story was well written and as I said previously, it matches the direction of MCU's trend having moments of great humor throughout. Story line followed on from Avengers Assembled covering the plot hole of what happened to all the alien technology. A few cliches but not our usual high standard of writing, we have come to expect from the MCU.<br/><br/>Visuals (9/10) -

High quality sound, actors voices were pleasant enough (Nobody irritating to listen to) nothing extremely notable about the music.<br/><br/>Personal (8/10) -

","HOMECOMING is the latest Spider-Man movie; given that no less than five other Spider-Man movies came out in the 15 years preceding this one, you can forgive audiences (and myself) for being a bit fatigued of the character. While I did like the Raimi trilogy (mainly as a fan of the director), I thought the Andrew Garfield reboots were terrible. The good news is that HOMECOMING, which ties the character in to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, is better than those, although still not great.<br/><br/>Spider-Man still has the problem of being one of the more annoying Marvel superheroes, and all of the high school stuff is by now a chore to sit through. The film smacks of cliche at times (I can't quite belief that the Asian-American guy is reduced to the comic relief best friend role) while the action is rather routine. The running time is overlong too, although the CGI effects remain as good as you'd expect.

Tom Holland's portrayal of a high-school aged kid who is naturally brilliant but in over his head after being randomly blessed with enormous power, comes off far more naturally than Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield.

I also didn't like that Peter comes off more or less as Iron Man Jr, complete with a literal Iron Man suit. Again, for me it took too much time to get him out of that and become more Spider-Man than mini Iron Man.<br/><br/>It's a common issue with Marvel films that they're a tad over-long. I like Tony Stark as a mentor to Peter. It makes sense and worked. But if it took 60 minutes for Peter to shed the Iron Man fantasies and embrace his skin as the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man instead of 90, it would have been a tighter and I believe better picture.<br/><br/>Then there were a couple of moments of dramatic conveniences that were a tad too much for me. Michael Keaton just happening to lose his job salvaging Stark Tower and also just happening to be the father of the girl Peter takes to homecoming? That really walked the line of being a bit too much and entering ""come on, man"" territory. It took me a minute or two to shake off that latter convenience in particular.<br/><br/>Those issues are outwieghed by the things I liked about the film, however. As mentioned, I love Tom Holland as Peter and to an extent I like the mentorship role Tony Stark plays. I also liked, however cliched, the high school elements of the story. They're well done, especially compared to previous iterations.<br/><br/>The thing I loved the most however, is Michael Keaton as The Vulture. Although the Stark Tower thing was a bit of a logical leap, it made perfect sense as motivation for an actual character, and that's what Vulture is here. He was on the brink of ruin for himself and his family and out of an act of desperation he turned to a life of crime. His turn from being a desperate man resorting to desperate measures to a man embracing being a ""bad guy"" was a bit too quick (we don't see much of a mental degradation) but Keaton plays what he was given flawlessly. His main fight scene with Spidey was good too.<br/><br/>Also Zendaya is a better MJ than Kirsten Dunst by merely existing.<br/><br/>And I'll never get tired of looking at Marissa Tomei, so there's that.<br/><br/>Overall I liked the movie, but it's one that more makes me interested to see future iterations of this Spider-Man than it was one that will stand out to me on it's own.<br/><br/>Aka, the Marvel formula."

I have been a Spiderman fan since the 60's. I don't remember him ever acting like a little boy. I cringed every time he interacted with Ironman.

Tom Holland is perfect as Peter Parker and gives us a great performance of an arkward 21st century teenager struggling to balance his high school life with his secret identity as the amazing webslinger. Michael Keaton also gives a magnificent performance as the antagonist (The Vulture). The Vulture is a different type of villain for the Marvel cinematic universe. He is not evil or power hungry, he is just a desperate businessman trying to provide for his family and Keaton portrays this teriffically. This movie also has fun, visually stunning action sequences (the ferry and Washington monument scenes). The only reason I didn't give this film 10/10 is because I found the final action scene on the plane rather garish and unrealistic. Apart from that, this film is pretty much perfect!!"

This is what he should act and look like and Tom Holland manages to make us see that on screen perfectly. The Vulture is also amazing because Michael Keaton is a movie legend and we had no doubt that anyway, but Tom Holland is the most positive surprise that MCU could've come up with. He is amazing in every way, the perfect kid to do the Spider-Man role. The movie is entertaining, it does not get boring for one second and keeps going with a fast pace all the way till the end."

"crazydrummer467-84945","8","0","1","14 January 2019"," Spoiler Review
","Spider-Man: Homecoming
An Orchestrated Review (Spoilers)<br/><br/>This enjoyable mcu film is a reboot for the ages. Im glad to say that I can enjoy a spiderman film again after so many years. It was a refreshing take on the classic character of spiderman and especially peter parker that fans, like myself, have looked up to and admired since our childhoods. Now i'm not going to compare to raimi's films because i think that would be inappropriate due to the fact that A. Raimi's version was not a part of a larger universe, B. Raimi's version and the mcu's version was adapted in their own unique ways, and C. Raimi's version had time to develop whereas the mcu's version was adapted into an already existed where it had to find its place. Marc Webb's version will not partake either because his version of the character is complete and utter garbage. Now onto the review.<br/><br/>First I will start with the pros:<br/><br/><ul><li>The Villain</li></ul>The Vulture is the first character you see and meet and he stays prominent throughout the entire film. Through veteran actor Michael Keaton, his portrayal of this character made me believe he was among the most sinister. In fact, he might among the top 5 villains I have seen in an mcu film. His character, developed thoroughly with rage, displayed his frustrations whenever he got screwed over. To be brief, I wouldn't want to mess with him. Vulture had the upperhand throughout this entire film. Spiderman never had a chance. Even the twist with being peter's love interest's father, Keaton's character was always ahead. However, Vulture was beaten technically by himself and the power he had been harnessing which allowed spidey to capture him. A flaw that is forgivable from a great performance. All in all, Michael Keaton really brought this character to life and I applaud him dearly. Also he looked really badass.<br/><br/><ul><li>The Suit</li></ul>The Spider-man Suit looks just as great as when it first debuted in Civil War. I really enjoyed that the suit, made for him by Tony Stark, was more fleshed out in this movie and we as an audience were able to experience him discovering all the endless abilities that it has to offer Peter. The suit is jam packed with different web combinations and gizmos that pay homage to the comics and adds a new AI system named Karen. Similar to Iron Man's JARVIS, Karen is Spider-Man's own AI and it really takes center stage from the middle of the film and on. Overall, the suit is a fitting upgrade to a well deserved superhero. I also loved the tease of the iron spider costume.<br/><br/>Now for the cons:<br/><br/><ul><li>The Love Interest</li></ul>Peter Parker is a loser, his best friend even states that they are in the film. Which means he shouldn't be able to catch the attention of any female he's interested in or even have them fall in love with him instantaneously which this movie portrayed. I'm going to have to reference the last two iterations of the character of peter parker to further clarify, sorry. In Spider-Man (2002), peter had to work hard to impress the girl of his dreams and risk his body on the line to even get a chance to talk to her, we can relate as an audience because that hits home in most cases. Spider-Man Homecoming reminded me of the direction of the first Amazing Spider-Man where Gwen Stacy was already all over Peter Parker the moment they met as he was already being depicted as a ""Cool and Mysterious"" person. That's not relatable and that's not how Peter Parker is. But I digress. Luckily, Homecoming shows that Peter is still nervous to ask out the girl that he overly admires which is where it hits home again. Overall, was not too fond of the Liz character until the end where she realized Peter was acting weird and finally stopped forgiving him.<br/><br/><ul><li>Zendaya's Character</li></ul>I was led to believe that Zendaya would be a major role in this film through marketing and campaigning across various media outlets. This was not the case and i was sort of displeased. Even if I had gone into this movie with not even seeing a single trailer I still would have been upset. Her character is in the movie for not even 5 minutes and is depicted as a side comic relief character with attitude. Although interesting, her role was way too short to be set up as the twist where she is the infamous MJ. Now, I don't have a problem with the name change whatsoever. I just believe that a character of that importance would be built up (and shown) more to a twist like that to have special meaning. Very underwhelming to say the least. Maybe in the sequel we'll see what is in store for us."

"dwankan","5","0","1","4 January 2019"," Great movie for teenagers
","I've been watching the MCU films, and I've enjoyed most of them greatly despite their (expected) flaws. Unfortunately, this one doesn't work for me, I think mostly because I'm over the age of 17.
This film is mostly a standard, formulaic high school dramedy. In one sequence, the sidekick friend announces to their entire PE class that Peter knows Spiderman. This leads to a high school party scene (like every high school party scene in every high school movie you've ever seen) and Peter struggling with whether or not he should become Spiderman to impress the girl he likes. The sidekick friend is chubby but funny, the girl is pretty and clearly into Peter, but he's too shy to go after her, the adults just don't take Peter seriously, and in the film he was mostly struggling to find his self esteem.
I came into this for a super hero movie, not a Disney Channel series following the ins and outs of a quirky teenager's life problems, and this plays like a lesson-learning episode of a standard acculturation serial, the Marvel super-hero aspect playing second fiddle throughout to the believe-in-yourself-young-middle-class-person plot.
The movie does have a few good points: I like Michael Keaton in it, Tom Holland makes a good Peter Parker even if he gets a little annoying sometimes, and it adds some (albeit shallow) depth to the MCU."
"JakeBrinkman","9","0","2","2 January 2019"," Holland secures himself in the role
","Maguire was a good Parker but a poor Spider-Man. Garfield was a good Spider-Man but a poor Parker. Holland manages to excel at both, making him a thoroughly enjoyable character.<br/><br/>The story is great as a wonderful change of pace from the end-of-the-world climaxes from recent superhero films. He is a friendly neighborhood hero fighting a villain that is a threat on a neighborhood level rather than world ending. My biggest complaint was how similar one of the scenes was to the train scene from Spider-Man 2. It seems this movie could have found an alternate moment of tension for that scene without looking like a ripoff."

"Badmoviessuck","9","0","1","29 December 2018"," Iron Man Homecoming
","This movie is great and is one of the best marvel films i have ever seen with a critical eye.<br/><br/>CHARACTERS
This movie is about Peter Parker all the other characters are enjoyable to watch but they don't really matter.
Peter Parker has a great character arc one of the best character arcs i have seen in marvel.
Peter has a desire that gets focused on and that is that he want's to prove to Tony Stark that he can do bigger things and go on bigger missions. And how dose he try to prove that? By defeating the Vulture.
Peter Parker is an active character everything that happens in the movie is by him making a choice to defeat Vulture and that's great.
And in the end he changes and matures he manages to prove to Stark that he is capable of doing things and he gets what he wants but he says no to the offer Stark gives him showing that he has matured and changed a bit a a character.
The first Thor movie was good. Why? cause Thor had an decent character arc and he changed as a character but that became a problem in the second Thor movie cause he became a perfect character that could do no wrong.
Captain America was the same but atleast in the sequel they challenged his views and outlook on the world which made the second movie so good, but this movie manage to mature Peter Parker but at the same time not making him to perfect still making him flawed so that they could make him grow as a character in the sequel. Just wanted to point that out.<br/><br/>VILLAIN
The villain is good.
Many Marvel villains are bad that's just how it is with Marvel and superhero movies in general but Vulture isn't like the other Marvel Villains, he is actually good.
They made his motive to rob banks and get money personal which adds to the character and the twist were we see that Vulture is father to Liz was great and well thought out, they for shadowed it in the beginning of the movie.
overall a great.<br/><br/>ACTION
The action was pretty good.
What i want in a Spider-Man action scene is Spider-Man finding a creative way to solve his problems i have always seen that in Spider-Man movies and cartoons and that's how i grew up viewing Spider-Man action scenes.
And they pretty much nail that part specially in the boat scene were the boat splits in half it adds stakes and it's Spider-Man trying to save people which is what Spider-Man does and it's overall the best scene in this movie.
The Final Act was also great.<br/><br/>SUIT
I have heard complaints about Spider-Man having basically his own version of the Iron Man suit with Karen and all.
I agree Spider-Man shouldn't have a special suit that helps him with stuff it removes a little bit of what makes Spider-Man Spider-Man.
But i didn't find it a problem cause that suit is used to add to Peter's character.
Like how he talked to Karen and when Tony removed the suit cause Peter was not responsible.
And they made sure to add stakes to the battle by having Pete use the homemade suit (Btw the homemade suit looks amazing it's my favorite Spidey suit).
Black panther tried to do the same but ultimately failed.
T'Challa and Killmonger fight and then when the train comes they get split so they cant attack each other. Were they are most vulnerable they cant even fight each other and Black panther kills Killmonger by being lucky and having a lucky shot at his chest.
Spider-Man he is vulnerable all the way having a disadvantage and he needs to use his smarts to defeat Vulture.<br/><br/>VERDICT
One of the greatest Marvel movies i have ever seen and i hope that the sequel wont disappoint."

"EddyTheMartian007","6","0","6","21 December 2018"," A very good Spider-Man reboot, but something's missing.
","THE THIRD SPIDERMAN REBOOT is very good. I think this is a very well made movie. The effects (except when they unnecessarily cgi Spiderman) are good, the score is good (but the weakest out of the Spiderman movies) the actors are good, the villain is good, the writing is good, the directing and cinematography is good. Almost everything is very good or great. My problem comes with Spiderman not feeling like Spiderman.<br/><br/>Now I know what you're thinking, this Spiderman is actually young, and is actually saying jokes. My problem with this Spiderman is how reckless he is. Before I get to that though let's talk about the characters and story.<br/><br/>The cast is great. Peter (Tom Holland), Ned (Jacob Batalon), and all the other students feel like actual students and teenagers. The weakest parts of the previous 2 Spiderman movies were the school, but in this movie it's great. It's relatable and it feels like an actual school. Flash (Tony Revolori) feels like an actual modern day bully. Liz (Laura Harrier) is alright. She's the basic love interest, there really isn't anything special about her. Michelle (Zendaya) is in this movie for some reason, she doesn't really do anything. Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) is pretty good, but I feel like she loses the depth and character that the previous Aunt Mays had. She just feels superficial, and doesn't really feel like a parent to peter. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) is used is perfect. He's in it the right amount. He does feel like the mentor to Peter. I love the fact that peter has a homemade suit. It seems realistic.<br/><br/>Adrian Toomes/ The Vulture (Michael Keaton) is a very good villain. His motivations are relatable, and he's likable in his own way. He isn't really a bad guy. I love how it ties back to the first Avengers movie. However I think we could've used some more time with him, he didn't have enough screentime. Also when he accidentally kills someone and it doesn't really phase him, and later tries to kill a teenager it makes him less likable. Up till that point he was doing something illegal to pay for his family. He wasn't a bad guy at all, and he feels like a real person, and not a villain. It makes him better, but when he goes full villain and is willing to kill a child it loses some of his charm. He's still good, but I don't think that was necessary. Maybe with more screentime his descent to being actually evil could've worked much better. I also love the suit.<br/><br/>The Story is pretty good. I have some issues with it, but overall it's pretty good, and it has a smooth pace. Peter wanting a mission and bothering Happy for it is really funny, and it makes sense for his character. So when he finds some weapons dealers and goes to them it makes sense. Peter balancing his school life and being Spiderman is done well, but nowhere near as well as it was done in Spiderman 2. When he first meets up with arms dealers I think he's very reckless destroying property while he's running through the people's back yard. This Spiderman has been seen doing flips and he can't jump over the Bushes or at least go back to the street. I mean damn this Spiderman should be called a menace by J. Jonah Jameson. The first time Peter sees the vulture is great, and you can feel actual fear in Peter. I think the fact that the Decathlon and The Weapon dealers being in the same place is convenient. Also Ironman being in every place where he's needed is convenient too, fortunately it's only used twice. When Peter messed up and the ferry splits and he tries to fix it with his webs, I think it was shown badly because he literally just needed to shoot like 2 webs and it would be fixed. I think Peter losing his suit was done very well, there's consequences to his actions. I think the third act is a little weak. The reveal of Vulture being Liz's dad was really good, but after that it isn't that good. His suit being in school, btw no cameras? I'm pretty sure I saw cameras in the school. Convenient Ned. Why would Flash give his car to a Spiderman cosplay. Despite crashing at the end he drives really well with mild traffic, a police should've probably noticed. Vulture tries to kill a 15 year old. Of course peter gets the strength he needs to succeed. That was a good scene though, with great acting from Tom Holland. Then Vulture goes on a plane and peter FLIES A PLANE. What?! obviously nothing bad happens. That's one of my big issues. Nobody dies in the movie. Peter is not responsible. He's reckless and can barely take one a few criminals while 6 months ago he was fighting the avengers. He's been Spiderman for almost a year and he's reckless, yet there are no consequences except him losing his suit. In the previous movies Uncle Ben's death is felt through all of them, it's what drives Peter, but that's missing here. He doesn't have the great responsibility that comes with the great power. All the other Spiderman movies there's a death peter has to deal with, but there's nothing here. There's no guilt or weight. That's my fundamental flaw with this movie.<br/><br/>I also don't like how Peter has kinda become ""Ironboy."" What I mean by this is that he basically has an Ironman suit, and his powers don't feel as special anymore. Also I think they went over board with all the tech in the suit.<br/><br/>Overall I think this was a very well made movie, but it lacks the weight and emotion the last Spiderman movies had.<br/><br/>7.5/10"

"calebpfeiffer","8","0","2","11 October 2018"," Very Good, Complex Film - October Review
","Spider-Man: Homecoming, directed by Jon Watts, is a well-developed and complex film. Meanwhile, it falls in line with the clich√É¬© plot of a hero learning what they are capable of until a villain comes along and defeats them, then in the end the hero makes a comeback and is victorious. The film provides an exaggerated and theatric perspective on daily teenage life and the struggles of balancing their school and home lives with other various responsibilities. The main protagonist of the movie, Peter Parker played by Tom Holland, is a high school student who finds himself struggling to maintain school, extracurriculars, his home life, and an ""internship"", which is how he refers to his superhero career. Holland does a good job of portraying the role of a young adult trying to do his best to earn the respect of his role model but seems to let him down more often than make him proud. The main antagonist, The Vulture played by Michael Keaton, is a complex character who believes he is doing what must be done for the good of his crew and family. Keaton shows the deep character traits of his role very well and varies them depending on each scene. The writers of the script had provided a good progression of plot and character development with each scene having importance to another. The director, Jon Watts, also does a good job of bringing the script to life in interesting manners. There is a scene in which Peter Parker is sitting in class seemingly focusing on other things. He watches the clock counting down for the end of the school day; each time the camera shifts to the clock when it goes back to Parker, he is then in a different period of the day. This provides a good way to show a progression of the school day without using too much screen time on unimportant scenes in school."

","I feel like marvel universe is trying to be multiracial friendly or something. It's really strange when suddenly peter parker has a best friend who is a fat asian(?) and has a crush on a black girl. This whole thing feels forced and unnatural. Also Spiderman is now just a highschool teen. This feel like a disney movie for teen. Visual and action is great. I love the cinematography. Don't expect anything intelligent or deep. It's just a fun family movie."

","Finally watched Spiderman Homecoming. Overall it was pretty awesome. The movie had some genuinely funny moments that really captured Spidermans humor. The new Spiderman was a good choice and presented a realistic reflection of teenage Spiderman. I will always be a fan of Spider-Man 1 & 2 by Sam Raimi, but this particular adaptation perfectly captured the teenage Peter Parker. <br/><br/>The action scenes were well done and entertaining. The story line overall was interesting and worked well with the pre-existing Marvel Universe. Plus Michael Keaton as vulture was outstanding. He made a developed well layered villain.<br/><br/>My only real complaint being the changed a few parts of the Spiderman mythos for no real reason. Other than that a great movie overall, 8.5 out of 10."
"bowmanblue","7","0","1","1 October 2018"," Where we all wanted him to be
","Everyone seemed to like the Tobey Maguire 'Spiderman' trilogy (although less said about 'Part III' the better), some people were okay with the Andrew Garfield reboot, but then all five films came along before Marvel's 'shared universe' really kicked off. As soon as it became 'the norm' to see Captain America crossing over with Iron Man, Thor and the like, everyone wanted to see their favourite web-slinger swinging alongside them. However, it seemed that there was one force more powerful than a thousand Infinity Gauntlet-wielding Thanos - studio film rights. Sony held the rights to Spiderman, rather than Disney, so, after much wrangling, it was decided that Sony would allow Disney to include him into their 'shared universe' (hence creating the 'Homecoming' part of the title). And the result is pretty good.<br/><br/>At least the film-makers were aware that, seeing as we've already had two 'origin stories' in a matter of years, most of us are already aware of how teenager Peter Parker got bitten by a radioactive spider and it gave him superpowers (plus he had a kind of extended cameo in 'Captain America: Civil War' to remind us all of his roots). So they don't waste any time with how he came to be and we join him already 'webbing' local muggers around his home city of New York.
I think out of all the Marvel films in this current batch, 'Spiderman Homecoming' seems the most designed 'for kids.' It's predominantly about teenagers and I would say its primary audience would be pre-teens. That could be a criticism, if it wasn't for the fact that it's one of those rare filmic beasts that can also be enjoyed by adults, whether you're heavily into the MCU or just casually aware of it.<br/><br/>It's worth noting that if there's one weak point the MCU has, it's lack of decent villains (excluding Loki and Thanos, of course). Therefore, not only do they get (former awesome Batman himself) Michael Keaton as the villain, but they give him some half decent motivation for his actions - he was a contractor employed by New York council to clear up the debris left by the alien attack which the Avengers thwarted, only for him to lose the deal after investing heavily in it. This makes him no fan of Iron Man and co! Now Spidey has a feeling that he's about to start selling weapons based on alien tech to the highest bidder, regardless of the cost to human life.<br/><br/>Of course, having Spidey in the Marvel universe wouldn't be worth doing unless we could have some decent cameos from other superheroes and who better to add in than everyone's favourite billionaire, Tony Stark (aka Iron Man). Naturally, Robert Downey Jr is excellent, even in small doses, but, more importantly, adds a much-needed sense of a 'bigger world' at work for Peter Parker to exist in. And who doesn't like seeing Iron Man and Spiderman teaming up to fight side by side? Tony Stark also acts as a kind of mentor/Uncle Ben figure to our young hero, further helping to do away with repeated backstory.<br/><br/>There's obviously a great deal of special effects needed to show the destruction caused by flying fighters and teenagers swinging all over well-known monuments, so expect plenty of CGI. However, it's certainly improved a lot since the first Sam Rami Spiderman movie where the effects looked more like cut scenes from a Playstation game. Here, much of Spidey's movements almost look natural (almost, I'm being generally forgiving).<br/><br/>Overall, 'Spiderman Homecoming' is a worthwhile addition to the MCU. It's certainly the most 'happy go lucky' of all the colourful films and hopefully Sony will release some of Spidey's other characters who they also own the rights to."

I think Tom captured Spiderman's mannerisms and essence with his dorky and youthfulness that just seems fluid with this web slinging super hero. Afterall, he was supposed to be just a kid and the other Spidermen were a tad bit older for my interpretation of him. This movie was fun and carried the Marvel cinematic similarities we've come to love.<br/><br/>Now if only we could get Spiderman and Deadpool in their own movie.."

"southdavid","8","0","1","17 September 2018"," Homecoming King
","A second viewing of ""Spiderman Homecoming"" following the home release of the film. I recently reviewed ""Thor Ragnorok"" following its home release and determined that it wasn't quite as good the second time around, as I remembered so much of it. Interestingly, ""Spiderman: Homecoming"" seems to have the opposite effect, and is even better this time that it was the first time. <br/><br/>Much has been made about this being the second time that Spiderman has been rebooted. Though I preferred Sam Raimi's films to Marc Webb's - I did prefer Andrew Garfield to Tobey Maguire. However, for the addition of Spidey to the MCU I love both the film that John Watts has provided and the performance of Tom Holland as Peter Parker. He is much more realistic as a high school child, which is natural give his actual age relative to the other two incumbents. Both his Spiderman and his Peter Parker are what the character should be, good natured and friendly, possessing a ready wit without being a smartass. Ready to sacrifice his personal desires for the greater good. <br/><br/>Also excellent are the decisions made to move the universe away from the two we'd previously seen. Ben is already gone, the Spider bite has already happened, Aunt May is much younger and better looking in this iteration (which becomes a regular plot point) even things like changing Flash Thompson from a big jock to a rich jerk are great choices. The ties into the MCU are excellently done, from having Tony Stark as a mentor, to Happy Hogan being his point man and the early scenes that tie the film to both the events of ""Avengers Assemble"" and the video diary of the events of ""Civil War"". <br/><br/>Despite his team of flunkies being a little generic, the main villain Vulture (Michael Keaton) is a compelling character. His reasons for becoming a villain are believable and understandable, if not quite justifiable. He is, essentially, just interested in making money - which is rare for a villain in a superhero film. <br/><br/>The three movies that we've had with Tom Holland's Spiderman have all been excellent additions to the MCU and shown how they can handle the return and integration of one of their principle stars back into the fold. Can't wait for the next one."
"rolandjordaan2","8","0","1","15 September 2018"," Spider-Man: Homecoming - Spoiler Free Review
","Arguably one of the most anticipated films since the start of the MCU 9 years ago, this was mostly worth the wait. Tom Holland shines in the title role, bringing a new charm and vulnerability to the character that was lacking in the earlier portrayals by both Toby Maguire and Andrew Garfield. The film itself is far removed in both tone and style from what we have come to expect from the other films already released in the MCU, being just as much a teen comedy as a superhero film and switching well from being mostly comedic to sometimes surprisingly dark. Michael Keaton does an excellent job bringing the Vulture to life, keeping the character eerie, yet at the core still slightly sympathetic. Although the high school plot line and antics do get tiring at times, they are not enough to spoil what is generally a very decent and thoroughly entertaining film."

","After watching the Sam Raimi Spider-Man trilogy and avoiding the Amazing Spider-Man duology, I'd heard about Homecoming. We get back to the roots of Peter Parker as the insecure high school student going about his life. This outdid the first Sam Raimi Spider-Man film (though I enjoyed that one the most before this one) and the villain was more relatable. This was the first time I'd seen Michael Keaton as a villain, after having been Batman/Bruce Wayne on two separate occasions under Tim Burton's direction. This gave us a second outing for Tom Holland's Spider-Man after Civil War. And Tony Stark wasn't bad either. This is one of Marvel's best MCU films along with the first Avengers. This was also my first Donald Glover film. Good work, MCU!"
"brianrorr","7","0","1","8 September 2018"," Pretty good, but underwhelming after Civil War Introduction
","I thought the film was overall fairly good, with some great scenes in between quite a bit of lackluster scenes. It definitely felt very.....high school, which I guess it was going for since Spiderman is a highschooler. The first 15 minutes were downright boring and disappointing, possibly some of the worst intro to a villain and protagonist in Marvel movies yet. But then the film picked up! And when Peter Parker was in the Spiderman suit, the energy was high and humor on point!! I loved Spiderman's quips at the bad guys on the ferry, perfect humor amidst fighting, and what Spiderman would do to make fun of his opponent, keep things light. I loved that.<br/><br/>The villain however felt quite bland and not scary. Only until you saw him kill his henchman with a gun, vaporizing him, and then later when fighting Peter and destroying the pillars to drop the ceiling on him, those were great moments and defined the villain as threatening. I did like that Peter got his suit taken away by Tony Stark, I appreciated they emphasized that Peter must be a hero, with or without the suit, and he proved that.<br/><br/>Overall, good movie and set up for the future. I hope the directors for future Spiderman movies give him a better villain, have less scenes in Peter's high school, and work on the jokes so they are wittier."

"andrewmerritt-31652","9","0","3","27 August 2018"," They finally got Spiderman right
","Spiderman Homecoming stars Tom Holland, Michael Keaton, and Robert Downey and in this newest adaptation of Spiderman is right after Captain America Civil War and the Avengers. This is a fantastic version of Spiderman because it doesn't give us an origin story because we've seen that done in the other Spiderman movies. And also we have Tom Holland who makes a perfect Peter Parker as well as Spiderman because he really does a good job at showing how sensitive he is as Peter Parker, but when he's Spiderman he's a wisecrack and that's how he's supposed to be. You can tell that everyone who worked on this put the time and effort to give us a Spiderman we were asking for whether it would be the script, sound, actors, I could go on and on. This can also be a coming of age high school movie meets a superhero movie as the movie borrows off of high school movies like the Breakfast Club, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, and much more. I did feel like it was too long though especially towards the end where I felt like they wrapped it up, but there was another scene after that so it became confusing where it ended. Overall, I thought that this was a wonderful version of Spiderman full of humor, action, and a little bit of romance there."

There wasn't enough in the movie to justify why Tom Holland would take the punches without reacting. You are forcing it here! Maybe show how incredibly rich he is, and how he basically buys an entourage, and THAT'S why Tom can't do more than resist).<br/><br/>Anyways. Keaton is having fun and that helps too.

"SharkByteAudioProductions","8","0","1","25 July 2018"," Homecoming absolutely nails Spiderman and his coming-of-age teenage struggles as a young Peter Parker
","Straight of the bat, Spider Man Homecoming is the strongest cinematic live action Spider Man in many years. Granted, Sam Raimi's movies were great action movies that arguably propelled the boost of live action comic book adaptations in the early 2000s and The Amazing Spider Man entries were entertaining enough but Marvel studios have really nailed the character of Peter Parker in this ironically fresh entry, even at the sacrifice of a more action heavy structure.<br/><br/>Spider Man Homecoming skips over Spider Man's well known origin story (if you're un-familiar, just watch Sam Raimi's Spider Man (2002) with Tobey Maguire) which was a great decision, considering this is the 3rd live action incarnation of the character in 15 years. However, Peter Parker is still only 15 years old in Homecoming so we get to see his character develop as our favourite neighbourhood Spidey, which it 100% nails ; this includes showing some of the more mundane and humorous distractions Spidey would get on a daily basis as well as his awkward, relatable teenage struggles. <br/><br/>Homecoming shakes up conventions by introducing new side characters for Peter Parker to interact with alongside fresh interpretations of older and more well known side characters with an eye for diversity too, which makes the film more believable in 2017. The comedy within this MCU entry feels quite progressive too, inducing cringe humour which may evoke questions from younger viewers. <br/><br/>The pacing of the plot is excellent, with smaller odds that suit his solo entry in to the MCU; this includes a believable, complex villain who's well performed by Michael Keaton. Tom Holland also smashes the main role, showing a very likeable, energetic and enthusiastic Peter, who stills manages to be honest, awkward and grounded which are the core components of the character.<br/><br/>My only complaints is that the action scenes are somewhat sacrificed for its character focus, which is a shame because there was a potential for larger on-screen battles with concepts the plot introduces. One particular action scene was also difficult to track and somewhat frustrating to watch as a viewer; despite this, the cinematography is excellent especially with its first person prospective camera work. The trailers for this movie also gave away a large majority of the structure so if you didn't see them initially, don't bother now and just jump straight in.<br/><br/>Homecoming is a fresh and easy entry for newcomers to a modern take on Spiderman, though it will leave you hungry for more fight scenes and action sequences which is one of the main reasons people come to watch to watch superhero movies."
"nolanpyoung","9","0","2","24 July 2018"," Great Spidey film
","This new Spider-Man is a hit especially with me and many others. Spider-Man was never meant to be a 30 year old college student but a teen going through high school and I think that version also gives him more freedom.<br/><br/>Now for the movie, I think they really made a new and fresh Spider-Man story while tying into the mcu while still having that ""with great power comes great responsibility"" line used somewhat in the wholesome of the movie. <br/><br/>I think it has great pacing and the twist with vulture being Liz's dad really through me off and shocked me.<br/><br/>Many others have complained about it being not as exciting or doesn't have as much stakes as other marvel movies. Well it's spiderman, he's a kid of course he isn't going to be facing threats like ultron or Hela.<br/><br/>The other complaint coming from people is the suit where People are mad that's Spider-Man is relying on the suit instead of his powers during the movie. That is sort of true although I think it was great that they put the suit in because it helped boost the feeling of the movie when tony stark takes the suit away and Spider-Man has to fight the vulture with his own homemade suit.<br/><br/>Overall: great comedy, fun, lighthearted, another great marvel film."

I'm a hardcore OG first Spider-Man fan with the goat Toby Maguire but we can't ignore the fact that he was way older than his character. Tom Holland looks so young and is actually young!

"domtaylor","8","0","1","15 July 2018"," Refreshingly low stakes and great performances make this the best Spider-Man film since 'Spider-Man 2'
","Easily the best 'Spider-Man' film since Sam Raimi's 'Spider-Man 2', Jon Watts' 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' is a constantly entertaining boots on the ground story, with refreshingly small stakes and a good sense of humour. Tom Holland is great as a young Peter Parker, one that actually acts and feels like a teenager, and his performance really keeps the film webbed together. Michael Keaton also gives a fantastic performance as Adrian Toomes. While the villain is rather generic, it's Keaton's performance that makes him a memorable one. The most interesting aspects of the story are seeing Peter Parker get to grips with his powers and begin to discover more about the dangers of the world and himself. The worst aspects of the film are actually the high-flying CGI action sequences as they feel entirely synthetic. It's a shame that they decided to make almost all of the action CGI, especially considering that Tom Holland is capable of performing stunts. In fact, he actually did do the majority of stunts himself, only the studio decided to make him do these while wearing a mo-cap suit, so that they could mimic his movements onto a GCI model. I personally feel like this was a bad move and that the action would have felt more realistic if they used an actual stunt team with Holland at the forefront. Still, the great character moments outweigh the somewhat unremarkable action scenes and the film contains one of the best, most tense scenes in the entire MCU. It's a scene in which in which there is no CGI involved, just two actors and a car. 8/10"

That young person who despite having gained awesome powers, hasn't quite got used to his new-found abilities yet and is constantly making bumbling silly mistakes.<br/><br/>Hence the reason he needs 'Happy Hogan' looking after him and Tony Stark guiding and feeling responsible for him.<br/><br/>And of course, they have Michael Keaton. A veritable coup by Marvel, securing the services of the Oscar-nominated Birdman and former Batman to play the suitably armoured flying monster guy, the Vulture. A great villain helps in making a great movie, as we all know very well.<br/><br/>He started in DC's psychologically-disturbed non-superpowered Batman and ends up in the super-fun amazingly-powered Spider-Man. Good progression, I say.<br/><br/>So, anyway, off he and his henchmen go, plundering away at and developing old Avengers battle alien technology and making a mint in the process. Hovering under the radar of the big guns and the authorities until the meddling kid in red and blue tights stumbles across their nefarious behaviour and sets about putting a stop to their criminal activities in an attempt to prove himself to his mentor and become an Avenger.<br/><br/>You can also expect a couple of nice references to scenes from the comics, some interesting revelations and a surprising little twist along the way. Marvel always has a fantastic way of making you think you might have seen too much in the trailers when in fact, you haven't. At all.<br/><br/>There are plenty of lovely healthy relationships built up between Peter and his high school peers and of course his (very sexy) Aunt May, with lots of trademark Marvel gags and laughs along the way in this coming-of-age movie, as Peter - with the help of a technologically-advanced spidey suit - learns and develops into yes, the greatest superhero of all time.<br/><br/>Yep, I said it. Again.<br/><br/>All we can hope long-term is that Sony pictures - who still own the movie rights to the Wall-Crawler - don't trample on what Marvel Studios' have done in a very much well-worked and welcome second reboot of the Spider-Man movie story.<br/><br/>Nothing to fault here because finally, we have a truly amazing Spider-Man done right, that whilst being a superb movie in it's own right has set up what should certainly be a brilliant sequel."

As a fan of the MCU, I did care a lot to see this movie and as being a fan of Spider-Man since my early years gave me a personal connection which was probably my biggest draw towards this movie. While the movie's not flawless, there's more to love than hate for sure.<br/><br/>My biggest positive is definitely the way Jon Watts portrays the characters within this movie as the script is really well done and executed by carrying a lot of comedy through it as nearly every character has a line that makes you at least chuckle.<br/><br/>The character I found the funniest is definitely Ned Leeds who might as well be Ganke from the Miles Morales Spider-Man comics but oh well. He is given the funniest lines in the movie and the actor who played him Jacob Batalon is a really talented guy with his delivery in particular. Tom Holland is definitely the best portrayal of Peter Parker since Spider-Man 2 which makes me very happy considering Andrew Garfield's portrayal while it wasn't his fault, was a bit wonky with the way he was written and portrayed as Peter Parker but Holland seems way over his head as a character which is definitely something to praise as that is how Peter Parker operates as a person. The Vulture is one of the best MCU villains because not only is he acted really well by Michael Keaton, he is really one of the best written villains as he isn't given a really cookie cutter motivation like 'Oh, Tony Stark ruined my job, I'm gonna steal a bunch of stuff because i'm a bad guy'. When we find out that he is Peter Parker's crush's dad we as the audience say 'Oh my gosh' because we realise that the villain is a family man while also being a criminal which is a really shocking moment but when driving to the prom he finds out that Peter is Spider-Man and he gives Peter the Dad talk trumps the shocking moment by a long shot because we find a deeper motivation other than Tony Stark ruined his job when he talks about his family being the most important thing.<br/><br/>Other than performances and way characters are written very well, let's talk about the way that Spider-Man is stripped down to a friendly-neighbourhood Spider-Man when the Blitzkrieg Bop montage kicks in when he stops the bike thief which is excellent in my opinion because it makes us feel like 'That's Spider-Man right there' which the Raimi movies only briefly touched on and the Webb movies totally ignore.<br/><br/>Although, this movie isn't flawless so let's get into that, shall we?
The action scenes (I think) are really lacklustre compared to the jaw-dropping action from Spider-Man 1 and 2 and pretty much every other MCU movie to date which would bother me more if I cared more about the action scenes in every Marvel movie but it still is a flaw at least in my opinion.<br/><br/>The score is pretty mediocre but hey, most of the MCU music is usually awful so it kind of isn't a flaw but it is a shame that this movie couldn't bring something awesome to the usually bland scores from other MCU movies.<br/><br/>The way that the movie is shot and looks is pretty much the same as every other standard MCU movie which is a shame considering how Jon Watts has changed the way I feel about how these movies should be written from now on but at least he changed that.<br/><br/>One more gripe that is only minor but still bugs me is that the suit looks kinda awful when it's completely CG but looks incredible when Tom Holland is actually wearing it but it's only a minor bug.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is actually very enjoyable for Spider-Man fans and non Spider-Man fans alike and is one of the MCU movies that sticks out from the rest."

","Being the 3rd Spider-Man reboot in less than 10 years. It's safe to say that this film had a lot to live up to, and I'm happy to say it more than holds in own as a Spider-Man film, a MCU film, and a superhero film. Tom Holland brings all the charm from Civil War and much more to this film, giving us what might be the best incarnation of Spider-Man ever put to film. The movie definitely takes the innocence of its character giving us a lighter story that felt needed and enjoyable. Michael Keaton shines as The Vulture of all characters giving a grounded feel to him, while also admiring the past. In the end great direction, phenomenal performances and a fun script make this film thoroughly enjoyable and memorable. Even if the effects aren't as nice as previous Marvel entries."

","Spiderman Homecoming is a mixed bag. In fact, it is pretty much two separate films- one concerning the awkward Peter Parker and the other his masked avatar Spiderman. This is the sixth Spiderman ever since Sam Raimi and Tobey Mcguire took the helm and although it isn't unappealing by any means, the narrative is stale and predictable. In fact, the Peter Parker stuff is far more enjoyable and appealing then the spidey bits. On a 10-star rating this would rate about a 6. Nowhere as good as the original Spiderman but nowhere as bad as the 3rd part and the Andrew Garfield version."

","As a solo character Spider-Man has definitely gotten more play than any other Marvel character. The X-Men have had more movies overall but there are more of them as well.<br/><br/>This version of Spider-Man is better than the Amazing Spider-Man but not quite as good as Toby McGuire's. They got back to the roots of Spider-Man being an awkward teenage nerd as opposed to this hip and witty Peter Parker that was featured in The Amazing Spider-Man.<br/><br/>The movie was too derivative of Spider-Man 2002. The nemesis used a contraption to fly and something else that I don't want to give away. But truly this movie had an uphill climb simply because we've seen Spidey so much. There were five movies preceding this one where we've seen what the webslinger can do. How would this movie top those? <br/><br/>It didn't. Tom Holland did a good enough job. He's younger looking, dorkier and even has a teenage voice to go with it but we've seen all of his stunts already. Having Iron Man make a cameo certainly helped but it couldn't completely save it. This was an alright movie but really it didn't have to be made."
"robo8","5","0","7","29 April 2018"," Not my Spider-Man
","Before I go into the critique, let me first off tip my hat to Tom Holland. He's a charismatic actor and the best thing about the movie. He is what probably will have me watching the next installment as well, despite being disappointed in this one.<br/><br/>And the disappointment comes from all the tech, gizmos and IT that for me was not a part of the Spider-Man i read as a teenager. Granted, that was quite some time ago and smartphones was naught but a dream. Maybe the Spider-Man of today is a tech-whiz and chats with his in-suit-voice-assistant. <br/><br/>But that is not the Spider-Man I know and like. Nor that he has a nerd friend that helps him out, acting both data-center-ground-control as well as last minute action-rescue. <br/><br/>This also applies to Vulture who was basically an Iron Man version, where the suit was the character. It was a bit of a waste having excellent Michael Keaton just being a CGI masked one-man-helicopter. <br/><br/>Hopefully the tech-craze ends with Parker denying the Avengers and maybe not having to have Tony Starks stamp on everything. But he did end up getting the same suit!?<br/><br/>Tom Holland will get me giving the next one another shot, but my hopes are not high."

","I would generally give movies like these a 7. I would have loved to have given this specific movie an 8 because how much I enjoyed it. But because of the trope it inhabits and the liberties that need to be undertaken to make the story bearable and likable despite their unlikely and leap-y nature, I came down to a 7 as you can see.<br/><br/>Having given that interesting and exciting tidbit about how my mind works when thinking about review numbers, I would like move on to the worded part of my personal opinion about this movie which is, I repeat, I really enjoyed the movie and even more so the cast. The story is fresh reboot devoid of the baggage of the previous editions of the franchise - Marvel couldn't rope in 'their friendly neighborhood Spider-man because Tobey Maguire (I quite liked the original trilogy) was too old to fit in and Andrew Garfield's portrayal was over-the-top, dousing the darkness (with Gwen's death and general loss of life) in such a way that in no way was fit for the MCEU storylines we have come to know. And all that didn't even matter because Marvel hadn't even re-acquired their sold rights during the times these movies were made. Thankfully, this movie definitely comes under the taglines of ""everything happens for a reason"" and ""good things happen to those who wait"" (both of these statements are not universal truths at all but do generally make sense because of how human minds and lives work and rationalize our existence). The story is way more high school-centric and the cast feels about in the right age groups which helps immerse the audience in the story as much as they can about flying robots and teenage spider mutants (and taking myself as an example, you could say that the immersion level is quite high since I have always considered it terrific and terrible that Spider-man could exist and world of superpowers was possible). The start to the movie is a cool move on part of the people who made the story possible because it really gives a contemporary to the times sort-of feel and integrates Peter Parker, played by Tom Holland into the MCEU. The fact that Holland has such great chemistry with RDJ and fact that Iron Man's personal stake in Parker's life and story is reaffirmed and plays a necessary part in his struggle to find acceptance for his powers just made it real for me, since Iron Man is where it all began 11 years ago from now (in 3 days, it all comes full circle when I get to rejoice or possibly get terrorized by the arrival of The Mad Titan as Stark and Parker try to fight back). As far as the story goes, it is fairly simple and don't think there is any point to spoil the little things as it far too enjoyable to go in somewhat blind. But it does provide that some room for the actors to flex their skills with a twist here and there.<br/><br/>Personally, I was much more interested and delighted about the cast and what they brought to the table for the story: <br/><br/>1) Picking Marisa Tomei as Aunt May was a great choice. It is not just that she is su[er pretty but also she also has been aging in a very graceful manner which means she still has the cute aspects of her face such as ""Oh, what I did do?"" face which is in a few scenes to fantastic comic effect. Also, Tomei being a much younger Aunt May than anything most audience general audiences does go quite far to increase the fresh vibe.<br/><br/>2) Martin Starr is, was meant to be and will always remain the Satan worshipping, furiously independent, witty coder Gilfoyle. But he is also a good actor and despite his short role, the very fact that he is the quiz team supervisor and speaks the way he does makes it funny. Welcome to MCEU.<br/><br/>3) RDJ is Tony Stark. I can't possibly fathom the role of Iron Man without him but as it is, Marvel will continue producing bucket-loads of these movies, irrespective of how it is rated and how much time is gone because the audiences grossed up by now is too big and too invested to not pay for it. That is one thing I do not like film studios with pockets full of content - they do not consider the value of the finite (Ask Quentin Tarantino and he will exactly what it is)<br/><br/>4) Fat dorky Friend to the guy in the chair is not a bad character arc to have, especially you have a good comic timing to help your role with.<br/><br/>5) Laura Harrier's Liz Allen is prettiest romantic interest across all Spider-man franchises. And Zendaya's Michelle adding that MJ name drop felt too cheap despite her seeming like a nice character to play around with in the movie. Actually it may have been because that she already seemed like a nice character to root for without having to associate her with the Mary Jane tag (there is also the race in portrayal issue; I would have a bit more miffed about accuracy if I were into the comics that much but it is Marvel's property and Art is not a democracy).<br/><br/>6) Donald Glover as the ultimate prowler is nice. The guy is so talented and to see how famous he has got since Community days (Onto Childish Gambino and Atlanta stuff; Never thought he would be bigger than Abed but was just a show)<br/><br/>7) Michael Keaton's role is not the same. His connection with Spider-man and Parker in that order changes the role Holland has work to in the movie and also on the audience identify with him. Keaton threatening Holland in the pre-prom car scene and the chase scene in the one of the most memorable moments in the MCEU for now because of how it made me feel.<br/><br/>So, thank you Director Jon Watts and in addition, Homecoming is where you may finally feel at home in Marvel's clutches (despite its money-grubby nature) and that is quite a good place to be before the War based and for the gauntlet which spans Infinity begins."
"jokerj-83585","7","0","1","18 April 2018"," Spider man homecoming review
","I watched it. It sucked. Here's why:<br/><br/>1. The cinematography is bland as hell. Too much green screen. It gives the film an ugly, greyish, bland look, that belongs in a much cheaper movie. Not one with a budget of $175 million. <br/><br/>2. The soundtrack. I found the soundtrack on youtube. I just looked up ""stock action music"". <br/><br/>3. The tone. This movie settles for a light hearted, disney movie style tone. Which is bad. It means that nothing in the film has any weight or gravity to it. The villain is often turned into a joke. The relationships are barely developed if at all. Nothing the villain does is dangerous or threatens anyone, and Spiderman's over powered, just to add to that effect. Nothing spiderman does has any impact, and he has no character arc; He begins the movie as reckless and overconfident, and then gets his suit taken away because of it. But instead of learning anything, he does something else reckless, and gets the suit back for it. So what's the lesson learnt?<br/><br/>4."
"andrewroy-04316","6","0","1","9 April 2018"," Very fun, light movie and great performance from Holland, but third act struggles
","Spiderman Homecoming is a fun movie, and certainly worth watching. Holland does a phenomenal job and is charismatic and realistic in the titular role. The interactions and plot are reasonable, as the context and Parker were developed well. I did feel like many of the flaws that were lurking came out to full display in a lackluster third act. The villains were bland and didn't have any depth to them. As frequently happens, there were many implausible leaps, with Parker surviving and getting out of situations at will and the climax of the Avengers having 0 foresight and the bad guy thinks of everything, and then Parker takes the plane down by winning a fight with the vulture. His interactions with Stark also seemed a bit forced and not nuanced, with Stark being unambiguously angry and happy in the climaxes of the second and third acts, respectively. Parker's decision at the end also just seemed bizarre that he'd turn it down and not reach some sort of agreement. It felt like an attempt to show character development, but was just a ""mature"" decision contrary to what he had done to that point and was just a token decision to show a change. Many characters and elements of Parker's life were realistic and intelligently planned for, but the ending just felt like pure deus ex machina to make the Vulture seem unstoppable and then have Parker handily defeat it. Despite these issues, I did overall feel positively about it and found it enjoyable."
"j_paija","5","0","4","6 April 2018"," Decent action movie
","I am not a fan of these modern action movies, where scenes and angles are cut fast. The pace is rather fast throughout the film, resembling those 3d-animations with lots of yelling and rollercoast-like screenplay. At the same time, the backround music is mostly traditional pompous orchestra. It was nice to hear a punk song a couple of times, but all in all the traditional action movie music does not fit this ADHD movie.<br/><br/>I am not comic/comic-movie fan and dont take these kind of movies too seriously, but i really wonder how many spider-man movies we need? I liked the trilogy, where Peter was young adult. Homecoming-Peter is what, 13 or 14? Is this change to appeal to younger audiences who enjoy superhuman-power-fantasies mixed with traditional social drama? If that is so, i understand the decision. I personally like adult peter parker more, even though i was kid at the time those movies came out.<br/><br/>What i dont approve is makin spidey dependant on technology. Most of the action is centered around Peter learning to use web. The joke dies kinda fast. The main story itself is thinner than spiderweb and has none of its entanglement. <br/><br/>OK, so, Peter does not make the web naturally anymore and is depentant on AI to do so. But there is more: other super-hero gear is presented too. I always thought that they are powerful because they are mutants and aliens and gods: why are they now so gear-dependant? Hulk-armour? Thor√Ç¬¥s magic-belt? I really dont get it. I thought they were super because of they are, not because what they are wearing. I kinda wonder if this super-gear-thingy is related to oncoming movies. Is there a storyline in which superheroes become weaker w/o their gear? Sounds like a really bad twist. I hope im wrong.<br/><br/>All in all, i found myself feeling empathy towards the villains. The heroes other than Spidey seem to be either ""dont care"" or narcist, like Tony Stark and dr strange."
"penguinopolipitese","7","0","1","1 April 2018"," I feel like this could've just been an episode of Agents of SHIELD
","If I could I'd give this something in the high 6's. It's entertaining but I sort of felt like I walked in half way through the movie and had missed something... we just jumped straight in with little explanation of why things were happening. Because of this I'm still not 100% on if spiderman actually has powers anymore but it seems not. From what I could see, this movie is sort of like Iron Man goes to high school. There's a suit, there's a non-threatening ai who helps the user of the suit. But what makes spiderman special exactly? Tony Stark may not have super powers but at least he has the intelligence to make the damn iron man suit. I guess it brings up another avenue of story telling when he's given his power by another person but it just doesn't have the same gravity to me because this is something that can be easily taken away and then you're left asking why couldn't it be anyone in that suit. Maybe they were just sick of telling the same story for the 3rd time. I had a similar feeling when the newest hulk showed up in avengers. It's just like: we need a warm body to play this role so lets just slip him in and hope people accept it and we can make some more movies. It's great to have the fuller embodiment of that universe but at the same time I feel like I've been to this puppet show and it was better done before.
This movie felt like it shouldn't have been a full fledged movie."
"bob the moo","Null","0","1","24 March 2018"," Enjoyable, entertaining, and slick with plenty to engage
","I watched this film a day or so after watching Wonder Woman, a film which had disappointed by how meh it all was throughout. I came into this one expecting it to be yet another by-the-numbers superhero film, but was reminded by it how well Marvel have delivered their franchise. By all rights, this film should be a disaster. It is the third reboot of the character in recent years, it is part of a massive infrastructure of characters and stories, and it enters a very heavily saturated marketplace. How then does it manage to seem so effortless in what it does?<br/><br/>I'm not sure but it benefits from the confidence that all the other films in the franchise do. It sets out its stall well, doesn't waste time on an origin story even though it does start early with its character. It has a solid plot with interesting characters, and produces lots of good action with humor throughout. It is an entertaining film that justifies the cost, and unlike Wonder Woman, the effects are consistently impressive and seem natural. It is a bit too slick and polished at times; some jokes and elements are a bit too knowing for example, and the cast has far too many recognizable faces in it that really only deliver a few lines. All of it has a quality feel, but at times it does feel a bit too manufactured within an inch of its life. Well worth seeing though, and yet another enjoyable film in the Marvel universe."

","*contains spoilers*I had no interest in seeing this in theaters for a multitude of reasons: Marvel movies won't miss my $(they make enough), I wasn't a fan of the Garfield versions so assumed I wouldn't like this, I'm not a Huge fan of comic book films. So I bookmarked this in my cable's onDemand function to watch at a later time... I was pleasantly surprised at how good this was. It took me awhile to believe Tomei could be Aunt May but I got past that. I thought Holland did a pretty good job and I really enjoyed Keaton as a villain (although I'm still slightly confused about his motives. He kept saying he was selling the weapons to criminals for his family. Seemed to me like he was just doing it to be rich). I also thought it was really funny w/o trying too hard to be so. All in all I thought it was pretty good and that they should stick with Holland for a few years. 
p.s. Ned was my favorite character, so adorable and funny! Thought he looked like John Popper from Blues Traveler when they went to the party!"

","""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" is an action fantasy movie of Marvel in which we watch a teenager trying to balance his life after an incident that happened and changed his life. On the one hand he is an ordinary high school student in Queens and on the other hand is a superhero called Spider-Man. Everything will change to an even more difficult way when he has to save New York City by a new menace.<br/><br/>I liked this movie because it had a very good plot, a well-written script and the interpretations of the cast were simply amazing. I also liked the visual effects and the cinematography of this movie which I believe was a very good due to Jon Watts direction that I believe was the most important reason why this movie was so good. It combined funny moments - scenes with romance and action, something that is very difficult to happen. Regarding the interpretations of the cast, some of them that have to be mentioned are Tom Holland's who played as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, Michael Keaton's who played as Adrian Toomes / Vulture and of course Robert Downey Jr. who played as Tony Stark / Iron Man. Another interpretation that I liked and I would like to mention, is Marisa Tomei's who played as May Parker. <br/><br/>Finally, I have to say that ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" is an amazing movie with a very good cast, a well-written and clever script and good plot. I strongly recommend for everyone to see it because I am sure that you will have a really great time watching it since it's very interesting and of course you are going to enjoy it very much."

","Overall, I really liked this version of Spider-Man. As an adult, I found it to be a little bit childish, particular the opening 30 minutes, or so. The plot was a refreshing take on the typical superhero movie, as the evolution of the criminal was really emphasized. I liked the geeky humour and the younger Spider-man. I absolutely loved Aunt May 2.0 who I found to be endearing and to have a closer relationship with Peter."
"shelbywaltman","7","0","2","6 March 2018"," Overdone.
","First off I want to say that I will give this film a 7/10 because I do not want anyone to think that it is an absolutely horrible film. My main issue with this film is the suit!!!! Spiderman does not need all of the tech that Iron Man needs etc. I am so angry with the writers for basically taking away what Spiderman is, he does not need all of this high tech to be Spiderman. The basic story behind Spiderman is that he is a kid in a suit and that his powers are enough to make him Amazing(kind of where the whole ""Amazing Spiderman"" thing comes into play). I do not want to step all over this film because it happens to be a decent film. It could have been an absolutely amazing film if they were to 1) Get rid of the unnecessary technology suit. 2) Do not let Tony Stark control Peter like he is a little kid. Just because he is young does not mean he can't hold his own."
"Mike_Devine","7","0","2","19 February 2018"," The reboot this franchise has been waiting for
","Disney's Marvel is a juggernaut unlike we've ever seen, as there is almost no end to the films the studio churns out of the comic book universe. So much so that they've resorted to rebooting franchises multiple times, with 'Spider-Man' now on its third reinvention of itself.<br/><br/>In 2017's 'Spider-Man: Homecoming,' we get to see the full backstory of Tom Holland's take on Peter Parker, who fans got a glimpse of in 'Captain America: Civil War.' When compared to Spideys of years past (Maguire and Garfield, looking at you), this interpretation of everyone's favorite neighborhood crimefighter seems closets to what's depicted in the comics. Holland looks the part of a nerdy high school geek, and he plays it well, making nerdy seem cool.<br/><br/>And while the superhero is the main attraction here, his supporting cast is stellar - from Michael Keaton as a construction crew supervisor-turned winged villain to Marisa Tomei as Aunt Mae, not to mention Donald Glover, Jon Favreau, Zendaya, Iron Man himself and a special cameo from everyone's favorite pepper (Potts, that is). As the Marvel cinematic universe has expanded, it's been easier to squeeze in all these characters, and there is a feeling that it is one continuous storyline as opposed to siloed chapters.<br/><br/>As for the storyline here, 'Homecoming' seems a bit lukewarm compared to previous efforts. Sure, the protagonist is still going to Spanish class and competing on the academic decathlon team, so we can't be dealing with anything extra crazy here, but Keaton's Vulture nemesis is not the most menacing thing we've ever come across. Instead, 'Homecoming' opts for a lot more humor and lightheartedness, focusing on adolescent issues like first love and getting asked to the homecoming dance (makes sense now, right?). Still, there are plenty of action sequences and cool shots of the NYC skyline that should not be taken for granted.<br/><br/>It's not amazing, per se, but 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' feels like the reboot this franchise was in need of, and will fit as a better piece in the Marvel puzzle for the foreseeable future."
"henrivallee","6","0","1","17 February 2018"," Surprisingly good
","Spiderman: Homecoming was actually good, I really didn't want to see this film because I was starting to get tired of super-hero films especially marvel movies, apart from the guardians of the galaxy movies they all feel the same, I got tired of the avengers or captain America, but my friends obligied me to see it and I liked it.<br/><br/>The story was fine, it was fresh compared to the other marvel movies, this was more of a comedy than a super-heroe movie, it stayed consistent but I never felt invested in what was going on...But that twist in the last third of this film was a pleasant surprise, it gave more weight to the climax between Spider-Man and the vilain and it made me feel more invested in the story.
The problem with the story is that it has to many jokes so it does take the intensity of the scene sometimes and the humor can be hit and miss but other than that the story was a descent.<br/><br/>The characters made this film fun, Peter Parker is just a kid who wants to impress the guy he idolises (Tony Stark) and her love interest, he's relatable and not annoying.
The vilain was the character that surprised me, the other marvel movies rarely had a good vilain in my opinion, this vilain howether is great, you can understand why he decided to do what he does in this film and he can be intimidating,iron-man was also great, he tries to be a father figure but he is flawed so it's a difficult situation and he didn't over stay his welcome and the other characters were fun and had their moments.<br/><br/>I was impressed with this film, it feels like a different marvel movie and I'm glad that I saw it, it's easily in my top 5 marvel films and it's a good summer movie."
"Semisonic","7","0","1","10 February 2018"," Best attitude since The First Avenger
","Can't say I'm a huge fan of the comic book movies - but I tend to watch all the big ones Marvel and DC release these days. Some are more fun, some are less - but it's always intriguing to see the evolvement of the approach to such kind of cinema.<br/><br/>It may sound strange to some, but, despite Hulk's unbeatable strength, Thor's divinity or Tony Stark's wit, it's the Captain America movies that became a pinnacle of the Marvel way of storytelling for me. Maybe because, unlike every other super guy, Steve Rogers is not even about the display of power but rather about ethics. Ethics that's distinctively far from any preaching, but is instead aimed more at yourself, making yourself your own harshest judge. For an superhero action movie, such approach is not simply unlikely - it's unique, allowing the film to bring in the dramatic quality that genre seldom is able to possess.<br/><br/>And now, after the pretty bland Ant-Man, disturbingly flashy Dr Strange and outright ridiculous GotG2, it's such a pleasure to see a Marvel film whose main character is as mature as he is modest. Sure, Peter Parker is still a kid, and the movie never misses a chance to prove it with a portion of goofing around, but he is much more than his goofy side shows. Which we seriously need to thank Tom Holland for. I have no idea how the genuine Spidey must be, but both Tobey Maguire and especially Andrew Garfield felt as if they wore the Spiderman suit mostly to show off themselves. Tom, on the other hand, is as natural in this role as a human being could possibly be, feeling like a true teenager for whom having such abilities is not simply cool but also awkward and even frustrating, and who's torn apart between the desire to become larger than life and staying down to earth.<br/><br/>One thing to attribute that character versatility to is probably the fact that Peter has a mentor this time around. Which is curious, because the same exact reason that turns Tony Stark into a great support for Parker/Spider-man buildup makes Iron Man himself acutely annoying. But maybe that's just natural, after all, all parents are annoying in their kids' eyes. Still, despite all the Civil-War prehistory and Cap's current outlaw status, it feels as if Spider-man's much closer spiritually to Steve Rogers than to the guy who's actually sponsoring all his superhero'ing. Why do I get this feeling that such resemblance isn't just a random coincidence and that it's gonna be built upon later on...<br/><br/>Another thing to love here is the villain. Well, apart from the tongue in cheek reference to the Inarritu's masterpiece, Michael Keaton's character is exactly what Spiderman movies (and Marvel universe as a whole) have been missing greatly: a villain who's formally a bad guy without a doubt but who you have mixed feelings and unlikely sympathy for nonetheless. Overshadowing everyone, Parker included, Adrian is a guy whose agenda doesn't only sound legit - it _feels_ like one: I couldn't help feeling that our ""billionaire, playboy, genius, philanthropist"" dude is like a huge corporate colossus sucking in all the tech he could lay his hands on, while the small guys might be equally resourceful and even useful for the society, if only they weren't pushed out of the game by the big shiny players.<br/><br/>One last thing that I can't get out of my head. Spider-man Homecoming is exactly what Deadpool might've aimed to be, but failed to: a film where clumsy isn't equal to devoid of a soul. Homecoming isn't perfect in any way, but it makes up for it in one single way: it's damn sincere. There's no over the top cynicism or self-irony, no self-adoration or self-loathing. Just a story of a kid who wants to be true to what his heart tells him to do and to be, and learns to do that throughout the story.

","I should say that I wasn't expecting too much from Spider-Man: Homecoming. I was ready to see Tom Holland being incredible as Spider-Man because he was in my radar after Civil War. But after the trailer i was like ""Oh no Marvel... Just don't!"" I went to the first day of Spider-Man Homecoming with a friend who totally hates superhero movies (I'm the right opposite) and she loved it so much. I had incredible time and I think the movie was awesome! It was much more different than other Spider movies but I enjoyed it very much. I don't think other people who don't know much about Marvel Universe would understand what is special about this Spider-Man but Tom Holland is just like the real Peter Parker! SMHomecoming was the most similar movie to comics. Tom Holland is now one of my favourite actors and I'll be looking forward for his movies. He is so young and he can do backflips, he can dance, he can do American accent, he is kind and he is such a great actor. Everyone should watch his movies."

","'Spider-Man: Homecoming' (or Spider-Man 6, technically) is Sony and Marvel finally playing nice and bringing Marvel's most popular comic book character into the MCU - will be interesting to see how he's involved in the upcoming Infinity War. A lot of people will ask ""do we need another Spider-Man film?"" The answer is, clearly ""yes""! This is just as good as each of the other first Spider-Man films, and is different in that it's not an ""origin story"" - there's no Uncle Ben - and we've already seen Peter Parker (Holland) with his powers in 'Captain America: Civil War', so the film starts with a lot of momentum, where Peter's trying to impress Iron Man (Downey Jr.). Also, excellent use of the Ramones!<br/><br/>This is the most age-appropriate Spider-Man so far - Tobey Maguire was 26 when 'Spider-Man' came out in 2002, Andrew Garfield was 29 when 'The Amazing Spider-Man' came out in 2012 and Tom Holland has just turned 21 - which lends a fair bit of authenticity to Peter being a high school kid with teenage problems. There is an actual homecoming dance, so plenty of teenage awkwardness, but it's all very watchable, due to Holland's charm and enthusiasm. He's helped by his best friend Ned (Batalon), who gets a lot of great lines and there's other comedic relief from the coach (Buress), the debate team teacher (Starr) and, surprisingly, the PSA's from Captain America (Evans)! The plot is all about stopping the Vulture (Keaton), who's constantly stealing alien technology left over from Avengers battles. His wing-suit is pretty great to watch and he makes for a suitable villain.<br/><br/>The film differs a bit from the comics, with no (thankfully, at this stage!) Norman or Harry Osborn, Mary-Jane Watson, or Gwen Stacy. However, there is Flash Thompson (Revolori) and Aunt May (Tomei), as well as Tony Stark, Pepper Potts (Paltrow) and Happy Hogan (Favreau) - and a multitude of references to other MCU happenings - to link it all together. Peter's suit was cool, but probably a bit too Iron Man-ish for my liking. Still, it's great to see Spider-Man still learning his powers (especially trying to web-sling through suburban backyards with no skyscrapers) and there's plenty of great action scenes. It's not quite the best of the Spider-Man films - a little long and sometimes a bit listless - but it has a satisfying ending and a lead actor who I hope to see play Spider-Man for quite a few films to come."

","My expectations were low going in. I wasn't as fan of the Raimi installments but was warming up to the Amazing Spiderman movies that were discontinued. A real shame as in those we actually got the spiderman in suit as portrayed in the comics. And more importantly; not so much a nerdy but a more smart-ass Peter Parker. So now there is this movie. So how was it? Pretty decent and fun actually!
Peter here is a young kid grounded in this modern day and age. The movie plays more like a teen coming-of-age movie than let's say the latest Marvel Avengers entry. We see high school (prom) insecurities being played up, a wing man for comic relief, being unpopular while having a crush an the popular girl of the class. Actually it's nicely done; just tip toing between clich√© while keeping it fresh. The cultural diversity was also good.
The acting is top notch. Holland plays it pretty straight as a quirky hyper kid full of ambitions. The jokes land just right, most of the time. I do feel Keaton was severely underused in the movie, but hey he is the villain. 
How's that saying again in another superhero flick? Not the Spiderman we want, but the one we deserve."

","I was kinda nervous about this one, honestly. I mean, how many times can we reboot this story? Thankfully, Marvel absolutely nailed their first chance at Spidey. The story somehow felt both true to the comics but also updated for a new generation, from the casting to the overall tone. It was fun. It was funny. It was youthful. It was simple. They borrowed heavily from previous Spider-man playbooks: a teenager learning how to be a superhero, which inevitably includes mistakes. The teen movie vibe serves that function well, and the younger actors kill every part. Granted, it is not perfect. The worst moments predictably involve (a) grown-ups talking with grown-ups, (b) action sequences that are muddy/hard to follow, (c) attempts to tie into the broader Marvel cinematic universe. Still, the movie manages to lightly float above all that. It is hard not to cheer for and laugh with this Spider-man."

","Considering how often Spider-Man has been filmed over the past fifteen years, the character really needs no further introduction. Marvel seems to agree, as they've completely omitted the standard origin story for the latest reboot (and merely glossed over it during his preceding appearance in Captain America: Civil War) to the benefit of everyone. Skipping the establishing shots and heading straight to the heart of the character - a high school kid, already in way over his head, who wants to fly with the Avengers - feels liberating and exciting, opening the door to all the good stuff that most other franchises would need an entire film's worth of development to earn.<br/><br/>It's completely tangled up in the preceding MCU films, perhaps more than any of the other properties, which not only works to validate some out-there story decisions but makes the whole family seem even more interconnected and relevant than it already was. The shockwaves of the Avengers' first brawl in downtown New York, for instance, are still being felt; in this case, they're indirectly responsible for embittering (and arming) a man who would use that scorn to become The Vulture. But despite the wide connections and thematic similarities, Homecoming is very much its own thing. The phrase ""street level"" tends to be overused, but I can't think of a better way to describe Spider-Man's role in things. Where Captain America worries over government corruption or Thor throws down with gods and dark elves, Peter Parker is giving directions to old ladies and doing backflips on rooftops to amuse hot dog vendors. That makes him more down-to-earth and light-hearted, which are both keys to what makes the character tick. New York lives and breathes in this film, dirty and foul-mouthed but endearing all the same, and that plucky give-no-craps attitude comes alive in its home-grown hero. Peter also looks, thinks and acts like someone who hasn't quite figured out who he is yet, balancing his urge to be a teen and do teen things with his sense of responsibility and excitement over his evolving set of powers.<br/><br/>Well-written, well-cast, well-acted and well-scored (seriously can't get much more spontaneously appropriate than the Ramones), Marvel's shown once again that nobody knows their characters better than they do. Tom Holland's Parker is appealing, witty, mistake-prone and worth rooting for. His supporting cast feels like a bunch of teenagers, not role-playing adults, and bring brilliant splashes of color to the film. Michael Keaton makes an excellent foil, sinister but not irredeemable. And the whole thing wraps up with one of the best parting shots in recent memory. It's not completely perfect, but in a way, that's almost fitting."
"happyslacker-81690","8","0","4","5 December 2017"," Getting Back In The Swing Of The Spider-man Series
","Let's get into the swing of things with the new Spider-man reboot. Spider-man: Homecoming is the first in, what can only be assumed to be, a series of new movies to get caught up in. Like a fly in a web, you won't be able to budge from this story of finding yourself while trying to save what you already have. As young Peter Parker, Tom Holland, finds himself faced with the need for speed, air speed that is, and the undying wish to be recognized for what he is capable of, he finds himself caught between the mask and his identity. With the right mix of action and coming-of-age story, this film is sure to be just the right kick-off to touchdown with the new Spider-man. <br/><br/>Holland is joined by Micheal Keaton, Adrian Toomes/ Vulture, Zendya, MJ Jones, Jacob Batalon, Ned, and even Robert Downey Jr, Tony Stark/ Ironman in the film. Holland's character, Peter Parker/Spider-man, interacts quite naturally with the other characters and portrays the reactions of an awkward teen quite nicely. Though some character's could have had more screen time, Zendya-MJ, I found that something had to give in order for the real story of Parker's struggle to be told. The special effects seemed to have a more comic and kid-like feel to them, with the webbing being used in many ways. Though the web- shooters and costume seemed very technical and real, the actual webbing wasn't as much realistic as it was like white glue. The special effects and damage shows was very real, as usual for the Marvel franchise, as was Iron Man's suit.<br/><br/>The music and additional sound effects were pretty well done considering the many action sequences. The music didn't seem too noticeable, which is the way it is meant to be, with a few editions of the well known Superhero Themes. <br/><br/>The plot is the big question considering the ups and downs of superhero movies these days. I found the plot maintained a good pace, though certain parts a bit predictable. There was nothing super new to the superhero story, but there were a few twists which was a nice was to check in and make sure the audience was listening. One scene in particular, that I found well done, was when Peter is stuck under rubble. I found this tear-jerking scene to be relatable and realistic. Instead of the usual, mask or no mask decision, this time the character finds inner strength through himself and his superhero identity. Definitely one of the best scenes in the movie; it is not drawn out too long nor killed by some joke. The realism of the character and the acting of Tom Holland is truly to be applauded.<br/><br/>This movie I would rate a 8 out of 10. It is a good start to the new Spiderman and will probably go see the next one."
"mustermann_23","7","0","2","2 December 2017"," Entertaining Superhero-Movie With Interesting Villain
","As someone who had neither read any of the comics nor watched all Marvel-movies, I got to see a surprisingly (refreshingly) different movie from what I had expected. Having checked some of the 1-star reviews here I must say they are a bit misleading - whilst explaining valid complaints (especially from Spidey-fans) that I won't repeat here, they often highlight the performance of Michael Keaton as Vulture and mention other very positive points, which all summed up should not result in a 1-star rating.<br/><br/>Most of the points seen as disastrous by others, I saw as quite the opposite: Having Spider-Man appear weaker enormously helped flashing out a character who is easy to relate to with a great arc and personal motivation throughout the movie, for example. I liked that much better than other heroes who are just over-powered right from the beginning (or directly after getting their powers or learning about their powers in a short sequence) and therefore appear much less interesting in other movies. And the whole the-powers-are-suit-related thing was necessary for Peter Parker to really and truly become Spider-Man after almost giving up, because this way it was possible to take something away from him - that whole scene was a nice visual clue to Spider-Man's ""birth"" or, maybe a better analogy, a kind of ""phoenix from the ashes"". As an engaged viewer and experienced fan of cinema in general I did not need to be reminded of Iron Man's words when taking back the suit, but I guess it helped some of the clearly-younger-than-me target audience getting it.<br/><br/>Let's talk about one of the best super-hero movie villains of all time: FINALLY some fleshed-out (and believable) backstory, great acting and an interesting twist! Even all the way through to the mid-credits-scene, so nice... The cinematography was good, colourful, not too fast-cut (especially the action scenes were great and not just confusing like in many movies nowadays), overlaid by an interesting score (starting right from the Marvel logo I loved it). And the end credits were the best I have seen in a very long time, looked like they could easily win first price in a competition at some short-film festival.<br/><br/>That all put together, minus the negative points (oh, I should at least mention some: Occasional bad (over-)acting; strong feeling of ""oh no we are not diverse enough yet, so we must cast more different skin types"" which in my eyes is still better than a traditional Hollywood-all-white cast; too often too bad jokes; undercutting a great scene that could've given much more depth to Happy and which was already funny enough just by the setting (for people who understand the character types and relationship between Happy and Peter) by a cheap toilet-joke just because that formula has worked so often in Marvel movies before) gives a solid and definitely re-watchable eight out of ten stars."

","(Flash Review)<br/><br/>This was OK and mildly entertaining but didn't leave a strong impression on me. Sure telling the tale of how a young Spider-Man learns his craft is part of the character's history and should be told but most of the movie was a clunky Spider-Man fumbling around, which was amusing, sort of funny and a change from the norm but it wasn't amazing by any means. For me, the boy tended to get a bit grating as he was a little whiny and the jokes were only of smirk level. I did not buy the love interest and their emotional connection as well as the school kids interactions as they all felt rather forced and fake. I also didn't believe the Washington DC special police force would not have heard of Spider-Man by now as they tried to halt his rescue progress on the Washington Monument. There were some neat action scenes, the acting was solid as well as a decent plot twist but thinking back on it, the plot twist wasn't very original. Fluffy fun but nothing more."
"NormanCroucher","6","0","6","28 October 2017"," A lighthearted take on a well worn costumed superhero
","This is the third incarnation of Spider-Man in the past 15 years, so it was always going to be an uphill battle to make it fresh and exciting to audiences. Quite wisely, director Jon Watts plays 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' for laughs and scales down the world-ending threats to craft a more intimate and quirky comic book adventure with street- level stakes. Thanks to the lightness of tone and the quirk of the characters, the film mostly succeeds, even if the plot never rises above the mildly diverting.<br/><br/>Tom Holland is the most believable and endearing Peter Parker yet - perhaps because he doesn't look like a 30 year old man playing at being a high schooler. Holland brings a wide-eyed charm and enthusiasm to the role and is instantly likable as both the bumbling geeky student and his bumbling heroic alter ego. The whole endeavor hinges on Holland being able to pull off the character and he acquits himself well, ably supported by a commendably diverse and zany supporting cast. Meanwhile, Michael Keaton returns to the superhero fold, aping both his Oscar-nominated turn in 'Birdman' as well as winking back to his days in the batsuit. His villainous plans aren't particularly interesting or all that menacing but his backstory as a peeved off blue collar worker (shown in a prologue at the start) helps to ground him in some kind of reality, as opposed to the usual Marvel villains who tend to be bog standard power-hungry megalomaniacs. <br/><br/>Set-piece-wise, 'Homecoming' takes a page out of 'Iron Man's' comic book and keeps the threats scaled down and pretty simple, making for a pleasant diversion from all the endless CGI spectacle and destruction porn audiences have sadly become accustomed to, even if the climax itself cannot quite resist overdosing on the VFX budget. Also helping to inject a fresh shot of energy into (what was becoming) a stale cinematic superhero is the way in which both the screenplay and performances embrace the true-to-life tropes and behaviours of modern teenagers - the socially awkward banter; the pop cultural savvy; the obsession with technology and gadgets; the infuriating desire to fit in and be liked, etc. The way in which the characters engage with the story and each other feels reasonably accurate to the perspective actual teenagers might take if a hero like this really existed, at least without it feeling artificial or needing to fall back on those hoary old Hollywood high school clich√©s. <br/><br/>The problems of the film mostly lie within its underwhelming plot, enlivened only by the wink-and-you'll-miss-them gags and the sheer eccentricity of the characters. The strengths of this reboot lie within the way the tale is told rather than the tale itself. In terms of those inevitable comparisons with its former incarnations, 'Homecoming' comfortably beats the dreadful Andrew Garfield-era reboots but falls a few steps short of being as entertaining as Sam Raimi's first two 'Spider-Man' outings, which offered up a different style of quirkiness but ultimately felt more cinematic than Watts' version. <br/><br/>This new street-level Spidey proves that there is still life left in the character yet, but because it embraces irreverence and comedy so well, there is a definite lack of tension and the experience feels a tad insubstantial as a consequence. Whether or not it can survive the common Marvel problem of crappy second installments (Iron Man, Thor, Avengers and Guardians all suffered from diminishing returns) remains to be seen. But if anyone can break the curse, it's the socially awkward guy in the red and blue spandex."

","This Spider-Man doesn't suck and it was enough for everybody to praise the film. But I say it is not enough. The greed that made the cinematic universe to even exist and mix everything up together is also responsible for the way this movie went over any limit where it is simply fun.<br/><br/>So you have the typical story: Spidey is a 15 year old kid in high school, with all the issues associated with it, but he is also the prot√©g√© of Tony Stark, Mr. Iron Man himself. That means Chitauri technology, amazing suit that does everything (with the eternal question about why not every Avenger would have one) all mixed up with high school jokes and teenage issues.<br/><br/>The ending kind of saves the movie, when Parker says he would rather not be an Avenger and keep taking care of ""the little guy"", but really, half of the movie was Peter talking to his suit (I mean, having Jennifer Connelly everywhere you go would be kind of nice, but still).<br/><br/>The villain was good, but hard to swallow. I mean Michael Keaton was perfect as The Vulture, but it's hard to believe a construction company manager would have what it takes to create the suit.<br/><br/>Bottom line: Everything is just jumbled together and it was the actor performances that saved what is, quite clearly, a mess."

As with any working relationship, conflicts flare up that risk identities and shelters of unassuming bystanders. <br/><br/>Latching on to the first target in sight, Peter stumbles upon the most successful Robin Hood in the game. Adrian justifies his operation by capitalism, the cruel chess match that has allowed the insensitive to rise, and the burdened to plummet. His family offers a full-proof alibi for his shady business exchanges.<br/><br/>Peter desperately attempts to be seen, while Adrian meticulously digs below the surface. This faceless rivalry will give the orphan child yet another father. The lessons sound eerily similar to Tony's punishments, and Peter's conscious begins spiraling.

Growing into your place in the world will make you sacrifice even the sturdiest pillars of your morality. Peter foresees this ugly metamorphosis and challenges the tides. Nothing can buy his allegiance, a trait that Tony becomes most proud of in the young maverick. <br/><br/>In an era of shameless self-promotion and needless crossovers, the humble tale of a blossoming superhero washes down rather pleasantly. No horrific casualties loom in the balance. The highest stakes is that some billionaire might lose money he can afford to lose, and a young gun faces a dilemma of remaining loyal to his cause.

","First of all, this was a good movie. Tom Holland did a great job of playing a younger Spider-Man. He played the young Peter Parker who has a crush on a pretty young girl Liz (Laura Harrier) and has a hard time talking to her. Michal Keaton did a great job as the vulture, even though it was different than the comic book version. Jacob Batalon as Ned was great and funny. Marisa Tomei did a great job playing a younger version of Aunt May (Even if no One called her Aunt May). Zendaya played the role of Michelle very good and she add some much needed dry humor into the movie. Overall, the cast did great job in there roles. Now, here is the down side. I am a traditional comic book fan. I'm not into this whole social justice garbage that movies and T.V. are pushing on everyone. Tony Revolori who played Flash did do an good version of the character, but Flash is supposed to be an athlete/jock and not a smart kid. I know that times have changed but when it comes to being bullied by someone that is smaller than the main character...well, that's not believable at all. He did a good job for the character they wrote for him but it was so annoying that he was picking on someone who was bigger than him, it didn't make sense. Now, the red button topic, Zendaya possibly playing Mary Jane Watson. I read several articles that said she wasn't playing Mary Jane Watson and Zendaya even said that she wasn't playing the iconic role of Mary Jane Watson (MJ). I don't know if Marvel can't use Mary Jane Watson character or they are just going to do an alternate version of her. I wouldn't be too fond of them from changing Mary Jane Watson from her original correct version of (yes I am going to say it, brace yourself) Red Head White girl instead of being a social justice warrior to change the race of an iconic character to a (brace yourself) black girl. I know I will get the SJW calling me a racist and that I don't know comics. I'm not a racist, I do know my comics, & I don't care what you think. If you get this far, here is what I think Marvel & Sony will be doing. I think they are setting up a Miles Morales story line. Now that would be great. Miles Morales needs to be brought into the MCU and I really think that this version of Spider-Man will be leading to it. Anyway, it was good movie & I believe most people enjoyed it. I did like it (Would have loved for Sony to finish the 3rd Amazing Spider-Man)."

","In fifteen years, Sam Raimi and Marc Webb have been the only ones favored in adapting the comics of the amazing Spider-Man to live- action movies, one with more notoriety than the other, but, after all, both managed to be entertaining proposals with their dissimilar varieties. Anyhow, the successes didn't last long, causing the retention of Sony's projects to keep on making popcorn movies. Such time of rehab had an expiration date, exactly, until 2015, the year in which the film studio announced, with presumption, the deal with Stan Lee's production studio for bringing back the carefree hero from Queens, something that amazed both fans and Marvel Studios logical chronology as to the introduction of new characters, who will soon be present in the magnanimous American epopee par excellence, at least we hope that. The first step, Holland signing up, then Watts, later an extravagant number of screenwriters, Keaton as an antagonist, Michael Giacchino usual adding and the predisposed tools by the studio allowed the coming of the first great adventure of Spidey after his extremely short glance in the film of Russo brothers, ""Civil War"". And we're in luck, since its director takes the overblown mold of summer film away, in order to manufacture a coming-of-age movie portraying the day by day of one of the most well-liked and beloved superheroes of the MCU in a fascinating way.<br/><br/>The script doesn't endure the consequences of the American trend focused on saturating plot construction of screenwriters, here, idea assortment works wonderfully, endowing this origin story with a brand-new, flippant, jovial and even original air; a ""Deadpool"" for teens. The base argument benefits by omitting info that should already be general culture for any connoisseur of the character‚Äî Uncle Ben's death and the transmutation from human to hero thanks to the spider venom, besides the succession of situations as funny as suggestive that will keep you on the edge of your seat, either by struggles or chases, jokes or dramas or, specifically, certain twists that lead to an enthusiastic and novice thriller atmosphere of thriller throughout the third act. The artistic performance of the sequences is on target, not as mega-maniac and grandiloquent as previous studio movies, however, ""Homecoming"" doesn't appeal to big things, it's a unique and necessary film among so much formality, politics, and honor driven by Captain America and Tony Stark. As for that last man, his appearances, neither eclipse nor shade the main star, without discrediting the importance of his role, he's vital because he's a paternal figure for Parker, teaching him the true meaning of hero, which not only lies in being privileged with extra human powers.<br/><br/>For the most avid and purist comic-lovers, the change of appearances, both physical and cultural, of some characters could be fateful, a modernization used in order to tie in with the strong egalitarian movement that becomes meaningful in the film world. Zendaya, Laura Harrier or Jacob Batalon provide the best of their characters, even so, they're not a copy of the original characters, With what they will be blessed, both fanatics and spectators, is fidelity to the circumstances of books, each scene is loaded with references and easter-eggs from Marvel's movies and comics, sublime and drama ones as the catharsis final when Peter is trapped under the rubble. These moments accompanied by vigorous and authentic treatment of the main character. Tom Holland invigorates him with skill, intellect and physical and acting presence, performing the role of a fifteen-year-old boy suffering the vicissitudes of puberty and heroism at the same time.<br/><br/>Marvel has been quite criticized for the lack fundamentals and power of antagonists‚Äîexcept Loki from ""Thor"" and (let's hope) Thanos from ""IW""‚Äî, a pattern that has been repeated in every film. However, by signing an Oscar winner (""Birdman""), illusions re-emerged and, indeed, they were not in vain. When a movie opens by putting in front the villain and not the hero, denotes the commitment of the studio conceiving Keaton's role, creating the most human and realistic villain of its universe, of course along with his stunning performance. Although his first sightings don't enjoy a strong impact, from the middle of the second act, the actor breaks down the screen, in detail, in the final twist.<br/><br/>Visually, ""Homecoming"" has highlighted points in scenes where tension components prevail, such as that sonorous attenuation when he enters in the prom, the inconvenience in the Washington monument or the boat's breakdown. Accepting indie roots of the director, serene nuance would be obvious, so it's not possible to expect artistic displays at the heights of ""Doctor Strange"" or ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", even the visual dullness of the previous installments by Sony. Likewise, we witness that Giacchino's score doesn't stand out at all, of course, leaving aside the classic and glorious Spider Man theme song in the opening, glorifying the logo of the studio. It's noticeable the most measured pace in action sequences with respect to its competitors, however, CGI cessation, protagonist's gymnastic talent, and grateful set pieces are what makes the movie so special.<br/><br/>Watts rejoins our beloved Spidey into the cinematic panorama, with the help of a motion picture that enjoys the delights of independent and commercial movie simultaneously, delivering magnetic entertainment, placing Marvel's film far above that fabulous film by Sam Raimi and Alfred Molina. Carefree, hilarious and intriguing, Holland's Spider- Man takes very seriously what he is doing, delivering one of the most loyal films to comics, still being spectacular and fun. Sony already has a vast idea catalog for the Spider - Man universe, hopefully, it won't happen again with their plans what occurred a few years ago. Blessed Marvel!"
"Vartiainen","Null","0","3","18 August 2017"," Marvel and Spider-Man both manage to still feel fresh... somehow
","The original Sam Raimi Spider-Man was a huge movie back in 2002. One of the first successful superhero films ever made and something of a trend setter. Marvel Cinematic Universe especially owns a lot of its style, sense of humour and even identity to that film and the trilogy that followed. Since then we've had another Spider-Man reboot prior to this one, which didn't seem to please the fans enough to last. It tried some new things, but not enough.<br/><br/>Which is why it pleases me to say that Spider-Man: Homecoming is one the freshest Marvel films in recent memory. It still belongs in the same universe and the happenings of The Avengers function as the starting point for the film. And yet its outlook and focus are something we haven't seen all that much in the MCU so far. Tom Holland's Spider-Man/Peter Parker is a street level superhero that still has to play in the big leagues. The Marvel Netflix series have introduces us to other street level characters, but their problems stayed on the street level as well. In this film Spider-Man rubs elbows with the likes of Tony Stark. Thus creating something interesting to watch.<br/><br/>Aside from that it's the usual bag of Marvel goodness. Amazing visuals, great set pieces, good action, witty dialogue. All the things why we love this franchise so much. Tom Holland strikes a comfortable balance between Tobey Maguire's nerdy Peter Parker and Andrew Garfield's wiz kid Spider-Man. Personally I still kind of hope they had continued with Garfield, but Holland is so good in his role that it's a wishful hope at best.<br/><br/>But putting all that aside, there's one other thing that elevates this film even above most Marvel films. And that's Michael Keaton as Vulture. Now this is what has been missing from most Marvel films. A charismatic, identifiable villain with clear, understandable motives that rise above the clich√©d ""I wish to tear creation asunder and wreck evil for the sake of evil"". This guy has layers and is even fun to watch. Loki is still the best villain Marvel has given us, but I feel comfortable saying that Vulture is a pretty clear number two. Well, three if you count Kilgrave from Jessica Jones. Perhaps even four with Wilson Fisk taking the third place, but I'm not quite sure who would come out on top in that particular match-up.<br/><br/>Still, very good movie. It delivers exactly what it should and is a breath of fresh air in a franchise that continues to travel from victory to victory."

","This is a movie, you'd love to go and watch with your family specially if there are kids in the house. After all, Superheroes fascinate us all. The movie goes on smoothly and does not really have any nail biting intense action scenes that are expected out of a Marvel movie, but overall it's worth a watch. Iron man's charisma is a cherry on top."
"classicsoncall","7","0","3","7 August 2017"," ""If you're nothing without the suit, you shouldn't have it.""
","This is the first Marvel super-hero movie I've seen that appeared to be geared to a young teenage market rather than a general audience one. For perspective, I'm a senior citizen myself, so it's probably obvious that I see it that way, but I never got the same impression with Spider-Man movies in the past. Could be all the high school scenes pointed me in that direction, but I didn't get the sense that this was a movie for adults.<br/><br/>The character of Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) in this one bothered me too. It wasn't the arrogance so much because that's what the Stark persona is all about. If anything, Iron Man's alter-ego seemed almost wishy-washy to me, considering how he went back and forth on his relationship with Peter Parker (Tom Holland). He upbraided Parker for having doubts about being Spider-Man (see my summary line above), wasn't that upset when Peter decided against joining The Avengers, then backtracked again after the battle with The Vulture (Michael Keaton). I guess I'm saying he should have been more consistent in his attitude.<br/><br/>Having read about three dozen other reviews for this film, one thing that surprised me was how no one else has mentioned the startling similarity between Keaton's Vulture and the character he portrayed in 2014's Best Picture ""Birdman"". It was the first thing I thought about when I saw Keaton appear as the film's villain. The interesting aspect to the story for me had to do with the human dynamic between Adrian Toomes and Peter Parker, each one knowing the alter-ego of the other, thereby adding resonance to Parker's teenage angst over the relationship with Toomes' daughter who Peter had an eye for.<br/><br/>Great to see Stan Lee once again in a Marvel film cameo. he was the tenement dweller looking out the window and commenting on the commotion below, stating ""Don't make me come down there, you punk."" At the age of ninety four, the guy's still got plenty of spark."

","Tom Holland, Michael Keaton, Marisa Tomei and Robert Downey Jr. star in this 2017 action film based on the Marvel Comics. This picks up not long after the events of ""Captain America: Civil War"" and Peter Parker (Holland) is starting to get the feel as web-slinging vigilante, Spider-Man. Downey Jr. reprises his role as Tony Stark/Iron Man who is sort of a mentor to him and he tests Peter's determination to become a superhero. Soon, Peter discovers that there's hi-tech weapons being sold on the streets by salvager, Adrian Toomes (Keaton) who takes the guise of Vulture and he tries to stop him. Tomei (My Cousin Vinny) plays Peter's Aunt, May, Jon Favreau, Chris Evans and Gwyneth Paltrow also reprise their roles from ""Iron Man,"" ""Captain America"" & ""The Avengers."" Creator, Stan Lee also makes an amusing cameo as usual. This is a great Spider-Man film, Holland gives the best portrayal of the character so far in my opinion, Keaton is great as usual and the rest of the cast is also good. I recommend this."
"msbreviews","8","0","2","6 August 2017"," Rating: B+
","One thing that I just loved from the get-go is that this movie assumes that you know Peter's backstory: the death of Uncle Ben, the whole radioactive spider thing, etc. It just starts right after the events of the epic airport battle and this is something that's new and fresh. I really didn't want or needed another origin film with the exact same sequences of the last two series.<br/><br/>So, is Homecoming a great movie or not really?! It's pretty good. It's not perfect, it has its flaws, but it's by far the best¬†Spider- Man movie since the '04 second installment of¬†Sam Raimi. The fact that the story goes in a different direction, with some different characters is definitely a plus, but it also has some familiar characters that are slightly different from the previous films or comics, which is also a plus for me IF it doesn't turn the movie into the wrong path (which it doesn't).<br/><br/>Tom Holland showed some of his soul and humor in a few minutes in Civil War and now he has the opportunity to actually prove what he is made of ... Oh my, how great is he?! In my opinion, he is the best on-screen¬†Spider-Man ever! He's compelling, captivating, funny and he actually looks and acts like a teenager. There are a lot of scenes where he shines and proves that he's one of the best castings¬†Marvel has ever achieved.<br/><br/>In case you're wondering, Robert Downey Jr. doesn't show up that often in the film (every movie needs its marketing scheme) and when he does show up, he's there more for the comic relief moment than for an actual story or character development scene ... Except for this one incredible character defining moment with Holland, that I think it's brilliant and it captures the whole ""with great power comes great responsibility"" vibe. I loved it as I love the ""father- son"" relationship going on between Iron-Man and Spider-Man.<br/><br/>The villain. If there's one thing Marvel and DC Comics keep failing at is their villains, they are always these bad guys that love to destroy things and they want to kill everyone just because it feels good or whatever ... Not Vulture, not Michael Keaton. His backstory is captivating and even emotional, we learn the struggles he's been through life and how hard he wants to protect it. The first 15 to 20 minutes of the movie's runtime are dedicated to the villain, which is a pretty uncommon method to follow, but it works brilliantly. Keaton delivers as expected and elevates his character even more with his amazing performance.<br/><br/>The script is great, it is smart and extremely hilarious. It also focused more on telling a Peter Parker story as a teenager instead of just expanding the MCU by throwing some badass Spider-Man action scenes and this is what Marvel struggled at the beginning with the origin stories of its heroes, but it has been pretty much solved since the first Avengers film.<br/><br/>There's a great twist in the transition to the third act that transforms it into a much deeper and emotional final standoff between our superhero and the villain. Also, there are two post- credits scenes, so make sure you stick to the end.<br/><br/>So, what bogged the movie down for me? There are a lot of tones throughout the film: there's comedy, then action, then drama, then romance ... The balance of it all isn't as smooth and fluid as it should be, which affected the movie's pacing (during the second act, it briefly becomes a little boring).<br/><br/>However, my main issue with the film are the under-developed secondary characters. Besides Ned Leeds (Jacob Batalon), who actually gets a lot of screen time, the rest of the cast are basically either stereotypical teenagers or plot devices. I know that they're not the key to a great movie neither the big focus of attention, but when they're so connected to the superhero's personality and daily routine, I think they should have been way more explored (especially when one of the characters is directly linked to the big twist).<br/><br/>One way to solve the previous problem would be to balance the action scenes with those needed character-development moments. The action is mostly fine, but that's it. It's fine, it's not bad, but it's not great. It is entertaining, it is visually appealing and it has its beautiful comic moments, but it's far from being awesome (for example, I don't have the need to go on to¬†Youtube¬†and search for THAT amazing unforgettable scene because there isn't one ... ).<br/><br/>All in all, Spider-Man: Homecoming delivers a very entertaining reboot of the series and it fits perfectly into the MCU. Tom Holland is the best on-screen Spider-Man ever, Michael Keaton is brilliant as the fully-developed Vulture and the script is super smart and extremely funny. A few tone balancing issues affect the film's pacing, the side characters are under-developed and the action didn't wow me, but it didn't change the fact that I loved this movie.<br/><br/><ul><li>MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)</li></ul>"
"moonriverwaltzing","7","0","3","26 July 2017"," Good but flawed
","It is well made and shot! All the action scenes were gripping, especially the elevator scene. I like how Peter Parker is portrayed as an excited, bubbly dorkish character but I remember he's a total genius too (which he isn't in the movie?). Great side character choices though. The major hole in the movie (and what I had been really looking forward to watching) is his origin story. How he was bitten, how he adjusted to his powers, etc. People might say they've seen that already, and I understand their point of view, but for me, the way he became Spiderman is the most important part of his story. Also, he's more dependent on gadgets? His suit was damn cool! I totally enjoyed his mishaps with his suit and I would love to see more of it too. But I was expecting something that would give him that edge...traits and powers that are unique to Spiderman. His body was changed by a spider bite but he got only super-strength and that's kinda plain. Other than that, it's a fun watch."

","A more immature version of the famous superhero, that is an enjoyable ride of self-discovery, adulthood and classic ""save the day"" action. The film takes several small and teeny steps, one at a time to develop the plot -- but it ultimately works as a standard story of great, but meager originality to its main premise. Twists and fun action are big pluses, but fragments of anticlimactic humor and poor character development are forcefully pushing the film down. But in the end it still serves as a fun one timer popcorn event, and that successfully restores the magic to the character that 'The Amazing Spiderman'- franchise totally ruined.<br/><br/>Personal rating: 70/100 Critical rating: 70/100"
"criticadelcinema","9","0","3","19 July 2017"," Spider-Man finally (kinda) comes home to Marvel Studios...¬†and oh, is it glorious.
","Welcome home Spider-Man, we missed ya.<br/><br/>Alright, I have to be transparent here, I'm completely biased on this one. I grew up with this character;¬†from the 2002 classic Spider-Man, to the 2004 classic Spider-Man 2,¬†to the 2007 not-so-classic Spider- Man 3. I genuinely love all three of the original Sam Raimi directed films.<br/><br/>When the two Marc Webb directed films The Amazing Spider-Man and The Amazing Spider-Man 2¬†were released in 2012 and 2014 respectively, I did a bit of brain gymnastics to convince myself that these movies were just as great as the original trilogy. Eventually, I came to the conclusion that the two Marc Webb films do not compare (specifically The Amazing Spider-Man 2; that film is a mess).<br/><br/>All this to say that maybe I love this character too much to be objective.<br/><br/>But even from an objective viewpoint, this film is outstanding. Spider Man: Homecoming has the difficult task of rebooting the iconic franchise once again. Everyone knows Peter Parker was bitten by a spider, everyone knows Peter Parker's parents are dead, and everyone knows Uncle Ben was murdered. Thankfully, Homecoming wastes no time dwelling on aspects that were explained in the last 5 films. Instead, we get to focus on a story of a childish, inexperienced Spider-Man that truly does not know what he is doing.<br/><br/>Tom Holland is excellent in and out of the Spidey suit, and it isn't too much of a stretch to say this is the most accurate on-screen adaption of Peter Parker. Holland has the infectious energy of an excited child throughout, something that is missing in all the other Spider-Man films.<br/><br/>This is a packed cast, and everyone here delivers, specifically Michael Keaton as Vulture, who surprisingly might be one of the best MCU villains to date. This is a character that could have easily been a throwaway that just came off as corny, but Keaton's acting ability definitely adds a lot to this role.<br/><br/>One of the best additions to this film is Robert Downey Jr, who comes in and out of the film as Iron Man. Jaded veteran Tony Stark's acts as a perfect foil and mentor to the innocent amateur in Peter Parker. The contrast between these two result in some hilarious scenes, as well as some sincere father-son moments.¬†<br/><br/>With five standalone Spider-Man movies preceding Homecoming, originality is going to be hard to come by;¬†especially when it comes to the action scenes. Thankfully, the action set pieces here are diverse and set a original, entertaining stage for Spider-Man to shine. From the Washington monument in D.C, to a ferry in Staten Island, to the bottom of a plane, all of the action scenes feel extremely fresh.<br/><br/>Where Homecoming really shines is it's comedy. This is the funniest film I've seen all year, even including ""comedy"" films (I'm looking at you, The House). This is a great example of how you make comedy organic in an action film (I'm looking at you, Transformers). Nearly every actor in the film has some comedic dialogue to deliver on, and nearly every joke hits. A standout here is Zendaya, who is hilarious in every scene she's in. Even singer/actor/rapper/comedian/??? Donald Glover makes a brief but hilarious appearance halfway through the film.<br/><br/>Some might not like the more lighthearted approach to Spider-Man, as this is definitely more cheerful than any of the Sam Raimi or Marc Webb films. But if you were looking for a ultra-serious superhero story¬Ö why would you watch a Spider-Man film?<br/><br/>Director Jon Watts, this entire cast, and every single one of the 8 credited screenwriters should be commended here as they deliver an original take on a familiar franchise. Spider-Man: Homecoming¬†is easily one of the best films to come out this year, and you should go see this on the biggest screen possible."
"MaximumMadness","9","0","2","19 July 2017"," ""Spider-Man: Homecoming""- Welcome home, Spidey! A fabulous return for one of the most beloved and iconic comic-book heroes ever created!
","Over the past nine years, as Marvel's Cinematic Universe has risen to legendary status in the world of entertainment, there has always been one consistent and never-ending hope in the minds of fans the world over... that perhaps one day, Marvel's iconic and beloved creation Spider-Man could return home and join the ranks of this ever-growing franchise. But it always seemed like such a pipe- dream... Something that could never happen. After all, Sony owned the rights to the character, and had crafted a franchise including some very well- received and wildly successful films centered on the wall-crawler. Heck... still to this day, director Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man 2"" is one of the finest comic-book to film adaptations ever released.<br/><br/>Then something magical happened. A deal was struck, and it was announced that Marvel and Sony agreed to work together to bring Spider-Man into the MCU. Fans were thrilled. Spirits ran high. And we eagerly awaited the return of one of our favorite characters. And after a brief introduction in last year's fantastic ""Captain America: Civil War"", we finally have the first stand-alone Spider-Man adventure in Marvel's universe- ""Spider-Man: Homecoming."" And it is a welcome and extremely successful work that emerges as one of Spidey's best films to date!<br/><br/>It's been several months since Peter Parker (Tom Holland) joined Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) for his last adventure, and young Peter is starting to feel antsy and under-appreciated. He passes his time juggling schoolwork, stopping petty crimes and endlessly calling Stark's second-in- command Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau), begging for the next mission so that he can prove himself and become a proper ""Avenger."" But Peter soon finds himself drawn into a treacherous and life-threatening situation when he learns of the rise of a new supervillain- Adrian Toomes (Michael Keaton), a disgraced former salvage worker who had been driven out of business and has taken to using recovered alien technology from the ""Battle of New York"" to develop and sell advanced weaponry to criminals. And Peter will quickly learn that his adolescent desire to prove himself could very well spell his doom when Toomes sets his sights on eliminating the wall-crawler using an advanced weapons-system he developed that turns him into the dreaded ""Vulture""...<br/><br/>Directed by Jon Watts, ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" excels thanks to its absolutely wonderful cast and the phenomenal atmosphere it crafts, filled with humor, adventure and intrigue. Tom Holland showed a promising start in last year's ""Civil War"", but here he shows us that he is beyond a shadow of a doubt the absolute definitive on screen Spider-Man. He plays Peter as that delightful underdog dork that we know and love, while also giving Spider-Man that trademark comedic and energetic edge. Holland is destined for super-stardom. Michael Keaton is also just perfect as a troubled man who has been taken down a dark path into a life of crime. Like many of the great Spider-Man villains, you sympathize with Toomes while also loving to hate him for the terrible things he does, and Keaton is clearly having a great time playing such a villainous role. Supporting actor Jacob Batalon is a ton of fun as Peter's best friend Ned, who quickly learns Peter's secret and turns into an immediate fanboy who vows to help him in any way he can. Marisa Tomei and Zendaya are both very good in their respective roles as Peter's supportive Aunt May and offbeat classmate Michelle, and both get their moments to shine. And of course Robert Downey Jr. is a blast and a half as Tony Stark... pretty much as expected at this point.<br/><br/>The film is exceedingly well constructed and boasts a phenomenal tone and atmosphere that in a lot of ways hearkens back to classic high-school comedies of the past. It's no secret that John Hughes was a big influence on the film's many sequences set in Peter's school, and I actually found these to be some of the most effective scenes. It captures that magical, youthful energy you'd see in movies like ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" and ""The Breakfast Club"", yet still has a flavor all its own. I wasn't sure about seeing Peter back in High School yet again, but by far this movie does the most creatively with the concept. The handling of character and story is wisely done, with everything kept fast and loose, yet also with just enough breathing room to develop. It's never a dull film, but you also always know what's happening, which character is where in their emotional states and how the grand story is moving along. And to top it off, the action and effects are absolutely mind-bending to boot! With a good combination of both practical and digital effects and the imaginative minds at Marvel, Spider-Man has never looked so good!<br/><br/>In the end, it really comes down to one simple fact- ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" might not necessarily be the best Spider-Man film. And it isn't quite flawless. It does have a few minor issues that pop up here and there and they do hold it just shy of getting a perfect score from me. But for the most part? It is a thrilling, enthralling, endlessly charming and wildly exciting ride and a grand return home for the character. Not only does it feature the best on screen Spidey yet, but it also boasts sharp writing, entertaining action set-pieces, witty humor, likable characters and a whole lotta heart. And honestly... there isn't much more I could ask for, and I am most certainly looking forward to the inevitable sequels and follow-ups. I give ""Spider- Man: Homecoming"" an excellent 9 out of 10."
"EthanBJones_03","9","0","2","19 July 2017"," There is no such thing as a perfect Spider-Man movie... but this is the closest we've got
","‚Äã'SPIDER-MAN: HOMECOMING' was directed by Jon Watts and stars Tom Holland, Michael Keaton and Jacob Batalon.‚ÄãThrilled by his experience with the Avengers, young Peter Parker returns home to live with his Aunt May. Under the watchful eye of mentor Tony Stark, Parker starts to embrace his newfound identity as Spider-Man. He also tries to return to his normal daily routine -- distracted by thoughts of proving himself to be more than just a friendly neighbourhood superhero. Peter must soon put his powers to the test when the evil Vulture emerges to threaten everything that he holds dear.<br/><br/>I don't think the day we see the definitive Spider-Man movie will ever come. But if this is the closest we'll get, I'm happy with that. Homecoming is probably the best Spider-Man movie and is the definition of fun. It does what Marvel does best but does it so that it doesn't feel like it was copying the other movies. It was funny, action packed and contains the best Spider-Man we've had. One of the best entries to the MCU.<br/><br/>Marvel's strong point has never been the plot and that is no different here. The plot is scarily loose and had an stupidly low amount of effort put into it. You could argue that the story is important but that statement is untrue. The story is the driving force of the movie and any film that neglects it has a special place in hell.<br/><br/>Please stay until the end of the credits of this movie. Don't skip them or you wont get the full effect of the scene. It is one of the best after credits sequences purely because it is merely supposed to be a little bit of fun, which also drives home the tone of the movie.<br/><br/>Tom Holland is fantastic in this movie. He is both my favourite Peter Parker and Spider-Man. Casting someone actually young as Spider-Man was a blessing after the 'special' age of Spider-Man-ing from Maguire and Garfield. Holland was consistently funny and made the movie very, very entertaining.<br/><br/>Bravo Michael Keaton. You retain your title as a god damn incredible actor. Your performance as Vulture was fantastic and, aside from one throwaway gag in the middle, you were frequently intimidating and scary. Vulture is easily my favourite MCU villain and that is mainly down to Keaton's brilliant performance. I can not commend the man enough. He stole the show for me in this movie. Well done, sir. Well done!<br/><br/>Jacob Batalon was good as the comic relief and served his purpose well. He never overstayed his welcome and he was consistently entertaining. Comic relief's can either be great or obnoxious, and Ned definitely leans to the former of the two. Laura Harrier was alright as Liz. Liz was just the girl, however. That is it. She was the girl the lead has a crush on and will save once or twice. She had no other purpose in the movie and I was very disappointed by it. As much as the Webb films have their issues(and they do), Gwen Stacey was an interesting character and actually contributed to the plot. Liz does not. And that is something I was very annoyed with in the film. I like Tony Revlori's take on Flash. I know many people will not but I personally found it to be a very entertaining and interesting take. Zendaya was fine as MJ but I would have liked a little more genuine development in her character, rather than a complete change in it. Jon Favreu was good as Happy Hogan. Nothing more needs to be said. I was also thrilled that this is a Spider-Man movie, not a collaboration between Spider-Man and Iron Man. They utilised Robert Downey Jr effectively in this movie and made the scenes he featured in mean something, and didn't make them feel like throwaways.<br/><br/>I love the way this movie was shot and edited. It was a very impressive looking movie and visually interesting. The special effects were a treat to behold. Guardians 2 probably has better effects but they managed to make a guy in a wing suit look realistic so props to them for that. The costume and set design was also really interesting and didn't feel lazy. Actual effort was put into it.<br/><br/>The action in this movie is top notch. Some may argue it is lacking until the last act(where this movies takes off for flight) but I disagree. More minor moments sprinkled throughout building to an actual climax is, in my opinion, better than having 1 huge battle during the middle and then having the two leads wrestle in the rain for five minutes *cough* John Wick *cough*. And then we have the climax. It is excellent. I loved it and, while I think there was a wasted opportunity involving the theme park, it was still very well handled.<br/><br/>Comedy is one Spider-Man's defining traits. That is what has set him apart from other superheroes. And that is one of the movie's defining traits. It is stupidly funny and entertaining. It is a fun movie and that is what it needed to be. You'll have fun watching this movie and, despite my hatred of Marvel plots, it is a thoroughly enjoyable ride from beginning to end. I highly recommend this movie to comic book fans. I'll rate this movie 9 PATIENCEs out of 10!"
"genemorrissey","6","0","1","19 July 2017"," some good bits but underwhelming over all
","Spiderman Homecoming is about an unpopular teenage boy called Peter Parker who is secretly the superhero Spiderman. The only person who knows about his secret is Tony Stark who made his suit.<br/><br/>Spiderman is played by Tom Holland who plays the role of Spiderman really well. He was very believable and realistic and very funny at times. He was definitely the best part of the movie for me, i think he will be remembered as one of the best Spidermen. I also liked the fact it wasn't the normal Spiderman origin story that everyone already knows about. How his uncle got shot and that made him want to make a difference. That would just be boring. Instead they told a different story but it was still technically an origin story, the film is about Peter wanting to be the best superhero and Tony Stark stopping him and saying he's not ready. The main villain is The Vulture and is played by Michael Keaton who's good and compared to marvels other villains is better, but not anything all that great. There are parts were he's menacing but never all that scary.<br/><br/>Now i'll talk about the main negatives. To be honest I actually just thought that the script for Spiderman Homecoming was just a bit poor. There were some jokes that worked but there were also some that just fell completely flat at times. A lot of the good jokes came when Tom Holland was playing Peter Parker, but when he was Spiderman a lot of the quips he was saying felt more cringey then funny. Another problem i had with the film was that although Peter was well written and the vulture also had a good character, almost all the other character were completely uninteresting, especially his love interest who was really boring and also the bully Flash who was just really annoying. <br/><br/>Spiderman Homecoming had pros but I felt that the cons out shined them and I was pretty underwhelmed by the film and would say you should just go watch the Sam Raimi ones with Toby Maguire."

The only Hollywood films I've seen include STRAW DOGS (2011) and first three films of the SPIDER-MAN series. Spider-Man has been my childhood favourite since long. I always wanted to catch one of films on the big screen. And I got this opportunity a few weeks ago. I never imagined it could see it in 3D. This was my first experience and I seriously loved it! Plus, Tiger Shroff's Hindi dubbing for Spidey too added to the fun.<br/><br/>Synopsis wise, it might look like a simple Spidey flick but don't think that it's an ordinary one. The story and screenplay are both watertight and fully engaging. It doesn't have any such flaws you can dig out easily. Besides, who would like to find flaws when our superhero wants to entertain us? <br/><br/>Entertainment is present fully throughout the film. Those who've loved Spider-Man, should never afford to miss this film. Technically, this film is a masterpiece and there are no noticeable glitches at all. This film intends to entertain as well as deliver a good social message. What's that? Watch it soon to find out.<br/><br/>The action scenes of the film are a major plus and look even better in 3D. The background score of the film is excellent and elevates the viewing experience. The editing is perfect as there are no unnecessary or boring sequences. Each and every scene is a masterpiece. <br/><br/>Tom Holland as Spider-Man is very impressive. Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark, the Iron Man is excellent. Other actors too are excellent. <br/><br/>The film also has a good dose of humour, largely natural, and keeps us entertained. I was surprised to see how the director has also made the film suit to Indian audiences in an amazing way. The Hindi dubbing excellent. Kids and families can watch this film definitely. <br/><br/>Having said that, SPIDER-MAN HOMECOMING is a must see for any Spider-Man fan and also for those who want visually engaging, endless action-packed entertainment. And for the best experience, watch it in 3D, as it looks even better in that format. Highly recommended!"

","Thirteen years have now passed since the last truly great Spidey flick graced us with its presence in cinemas;¬†Spider-Man 2¬†came out way back in 2004 (God, I feel old). And I was starting to believe we'd never see another good depiction of the web- slinger. Then, Marvel Studios signed a contract with the greedy ass-hats at Sony, and his movie rights were restored -- Spidey was finally back home.<br/><br/>Let me tell you: I never thought I would get to see Spider-Man (Tom Holland) humiliating low-life bike thieves and helping innocent old ladies cross the busy streets of Queens to the beats of ""Blitzkrieg Bop"" by Ramones, and it was glorious. Every bit of it worked. This fresh, light-hearted, John Hughes-esque take on everyone's favourite wall-crawler is exactly what we've needed, because we finally get to see him as he was in the comics: a nerdy, unpopular high-schooler -- just a kid.<br/><br/>Is this version of Peter Parker riding his skateboard in the halls of the school? Is he flaunting finger guns and air-humping in the streets of New York?? No, he's dealing with crushes, and parties, and dances -- all of which are, in the mind of a teenager, just as scary as having to battle it out with any winged super-villain. He also spends time building lego Death Stars and such with his pal, Ned (Jacob Batalon) -- who owns every second of his screen-time -- and, despite his advice from Tony Stark (RDJ), does not seem to want to ""forget about the flying, vulture guy.""<br/><br/>It's just not in Peter's nature to watch someone -- not unlike himself on a thematic level, by the way -- get away with so much bad, even when the reasoning is surprisingly sound (Michael Keaton's vulture is one of the better Marvel villains in recent memory). He carries with him this sense of child-like purity that we haven't seen before. Believe me: this charming innocence really comes into play near the climax of the film -- during a tremendously impactful tribute to a very special issue of the earlier comics. I might've even shed a tear or two.<br/><br/>I know that¬†Spider-Man: Homecoming¬†is already doing spectacularly well at the box- office, but I still encourage you to go and see it. Have fun with it. You haven't seen Spidey like this before, and he's well worth your time. It's great. Trust me."

","I'm not a big marvel fan,but I'm going to say this movie is amazing. Strong cast(Aunt May is so sexy!)„ÄÅwonderful storyboard and aspiring morality,no doubt the movie is highly recommended.

"destinylives52","9","0","3","15 July 2017"," A Successful Fresh Start
","""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" is a successful, fresh start to one of the most loved, Marvel Comics character. Playing a 15-year-old Peter Parker/Spidey is Tom Holland, who is perfect for the role, and better at it than any other actor who played the webslinger in previous movies and TV specials (yes, there were live-action, Spider-Man TV specials a long time ago). After coming home from his epic battle in Europe (""Captain America: Civil War""), Holland is back in Queens, NYC, itching for a new mission from his mentor, Tony Stark/Iron Man (played by Robert Downey Jr.). But his dream of another epic fight doesn't come, and Holland is forced to do street level superhero stuff while juggling the cruelties and confusion of High School.<br/><br/>Then one day, Holland comes upon a weapons deal that leads him to a gang of criminals who deal in modified, alien tech. A gang that is led by The Vulture. A gang that will test the teen-aged superhero in every way. With his pleas for assistance from Downey Jr. seemingly going unanswered, Holland takes it upon himself to stop The Vulture from stealing more alien tech that will kill many more lives. But the cost of saving lives may cost Holland his own.<br/><br/>My most memorable, movie moment of ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" is the final scene of the movie. I won't spoil it, but I will say it was shocking and very funny.<br/><br/>Let me address a big problem many fans/moviegoers had with this movie: Spider-Man's lack of his ""spider senses,"" which warn him of dangers. I do believe he does have his spidey senses; but it is done in very subtle way. In the comics and cartoons, Spidey says things like ""My spider senses are tingling..."" Well, we can't have that in the movie, because it'll just sound retarded. When Spidey is dodging bullets or items being thrown at him, we just have to assume part of him doing that is because of his spidey senses. And yes, I know Spider-Man gets hit quite often in this movie...that's not proof of his lack of spidey senses. In the comics and cartoons, Spider-Man takes hits also, despite having spider senses that warn him of immediate danger. He's not perfect, once in a while he gets hit. Also, remember that in this movie, Spider-Man is 15-years-old, and still adapting to his newly-found powers, powers that sometimes overwhelm his senses. His suit addresses that sensory overload, but not completely. So, bottom line, this isn't an issue for me. Moving on...<br/><br/>""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" is a very good movie that I think will satisfy most fans of this character. Tom Holland once again kills it with his portrayal of a teen version of Spider-Man, as does Downey Jr. with his flawless take on Tony Stark. Add to this lots of huge, action sequences, numerous funny moments, an interesting villain, great special effects...it all adds up to a very memorable, Spider-Man movie.<br/><br/>I do have to mention a huge shenanigan though: a plane full of extremely valuable/dangerous items is flying solo, no guards inside, no automated Iron Man soldiers, no military escorts? It just relies on a stealth tech, and it has a ""blind spot"" that The Vulture takes advantage of? Get the hell out! But for this huge, glaring shenanigan, I would have given this movie an ""A"" grade. It doesn't ruin the movie, of course; but it does take quite a bit of the shine off.<br/><br/>Mannysmemorablemoviemoments"
"bravesfanc","8","0","3","15 July 2017"," Another good Marvel movie
","Spider-Man: Homecoming might be the most light hearted movie so far in the Marvel Universe. It essentially begins right after Peter Parker has his fight in Captain America: Civil War. The opening is Peter filming his journey after being recruited by Tony Stark. Just a little backstory as to how he showed up in Civil War.<br/><br/>Back to real life, Peter struggles with the normality. He wants so badly to be back with the Avengers that he's missing out on his high school experience.<br/><br/>The villain in the movie is the Vulture played by Michael Keaton, who I really enjoyed in the role. There was a deeper meaning behind his motives which caught me off guard and I liked it.<br/><br/>It's a fun film and isn't as intense as most Marvel movies. Tom Holland is a good young actor and his charisma was perfect as the new Spider-Man. A solid 8/10"
"chriscarlisle25","9","0","3","15 July 2017"," It's a Wonderful Day In the Neighborhood for Spidey!
","I am going to keep this review short, sweet, and simple. This Spidey movie may be better than Spider-Man 2 in certain aspects. I really enjoyed both the action, and the acting. Tom Holland is great as both Peter Parker, and his alter-ego Spider-Man. You can really feel his anxiety, and empathize with him. Michael Keaton actually makes for a fantastic intimidating villain with his own moral code in this one. You both sympathize with, and despise the guy at the same time. I never thought I'd see the day where I actually would like Vulture. The rest of the supporting cast play their roles fairly well too; especially Peter's friend Ned Leeds. He is a funny side character with a few standout scenes of his own. There were a couple of scenes where I found myself chuckling. The action in this one is pretty stellar, and Spider- Man is exactly how he should be in this one. He is the wise cracking, swashbuckling teenage hero he was intended to be. The costume is better than any previous iteration in my opinion. This one made more sense in a lot of ways, and was more faithful to the comics. They even play an adaptation of his old cartoon theme! All in all, an amazing movie!"

"koen_smit","8","0","3","15 July 2017"," Great movie but too many spoilers in the trailers and some weird castingchoices
","Let's start with saying: I liked this movie a lot. It's a fresh take on the Spiderman movies we've seen in the past and a clear part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. <br/><br/>We've seen Tom Holland in Captain America: Civil War and he made quite a strong impression there as the somewhat clumsy, young and witty Spider-man. So my expectations for his stand-alone movie were quite high. <br/><br/>And they did deliver it well. It was a fun and exciting coming-of-age/high school movie with a a great villain in alien-arms-dealer Michael Keaton. And Robert Downey Jr./Tony Stark in a somewhat struggling father-figure role. And because we have a really young Peter Parker, we can also have a younger than usual aunt May, funny and vibrant Marisa Tomei.<br/><br/>So far so good. Some disasters Spidy has to prevent/fix are directly because his own doing. He jumps into situations without a second thought and deals with them on the spot. This brave and hyperactive Spidy fits well in the MCU and is bound to be a comic relief for a lot of coming movies.<br/><br/>So, the writing, camera-work, editing, production, directions and acting is great - why not a 10? Simply because the trailers (except for the home-video teasers) gave away too much of the movie. I new what was going to happen and that took away a lot of fun and excitement for me. I go to the cinema a lot, so it's hard not to look at the trailers. And it felt too politically correct in casting. Especially Flash was cast wrong. Tony Revolori did well for the part he got, but my Flash is a big mostly physical bully in the comics and the choice for a short snakelike mean character who is part of the decathlon team seemed off. <br/><br/>Apart from that I enjoyed the movie a lot 8/10"
"Red_Identity","Null","0","2","15 July 2017"," Does pretty much everything right
","I'm not a big fan of Marvel films. I've liked a few of them, and none of them have been outright terrible, but they're mostly just average and nothing to write home about. I think Spiderman: Homecoming feels so fresh because it isn't concerned with the usual ""save the world"" plot that many of these films are. It's incredibly grounded and what it has going for it is a lot of relatable, actually funny humor centered around Peter Parker's life as a teenager. More than anything that is what the film gets right: the tone of high school. The action sequences in this are well done but none of them bog down the film's true heart. This is pretty much everything the film needed to be."

","Spider-man Man: Homecoming or Spider-man: back to home.<br/><br/>Peter Parker (Tom Holland) after being called by Tony Stark to his side in Captain America: Civil War, must deal life in high school and in his own house, and at the same time become little by little in an avenger.<br/><br/>Let's start with the actors. Tom Holland as Peter Parker/Spider-Man is a great success for the film. Holland has the character, personality, age, (not like the others...), and when I discovered that Holland was groin, causing it to explode, I did not expect it, his accent is almost perfect. Michael Keaton (Batman) as Adrian Tooms or the Vulture, is the best part of the movie. Before the premiere we had all the hope in this villain, and exceeded expectations. It is a great character, their reasons are comprendibles, until some (the audience) are characterized with the character. And the truth is that Zendaya was OK, not outstanding, but well, like Jacob Whole Battalion as Ned, very funny. And Aunt May that is one of my favorite parts of the movie, with all that is sexy on the streets, in the restaurant, until they tell Peter in the school. I liked the character of Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man (obviously)<br/><br/>Thanks Sony for giving the rights, if not we would not have this movie. The sub machine gun of jokes, jokes, references in the film is impeccable, i think i saw 1 or 2 jokes out of place, but all (which were many) were very gracious and place each one of them. Marvel knows how to move these characters (for example Spider-Man) not as Sony does not know how to exploit to the maximum (The Amazing Spider-Man: The threat of electro)<br/><br/>Very funny 9/10"
"riordantheking","7","0","3","13 July 2017"," Just a blast to watch.
","I mean, it's an MCU film, so you can always count on the movie being fun, quippy and well made. This new Spider-Man film is no different, and that's certainly not a bad thing.<br/><br/>It's not a groundbreaking movie, and overall I didn't think it was as good as the first two Raimi films, nor last years Captain America: Civil War, which introduced Tom Holland's portrayal of Peter Parker, but I felt that it was a step above Spider-Man 3 (which is still good), and both of The Amazing Spider-Man films (which are far from good).<br/><br/>Tom Holland is as good in this as he was in Civil War, showing the teen awkwardness of Peter Parker and also the heroism of Spider-Man. I surprisingly enjoyed the villain, The Vulture, as played by Michael Keaton, who, in a surprise twist, is the father of Liz, Peter's love interest (I warned you about spoilers). Liz herself is okay, but about as forgettable as Rachel McAdams' character from Doctor Strange. Zendaya and Jacob Batalon both do well as friends of Peter, and provide good comic relief. Robert Downey Jr and Jon Favreau both feature as returning characters from previous Marvel movies, and do a good job, and surprisingly, Gwyneth Paltrow also reprises her role as Pepper Potts, which was neat to see.<br/><br/>The action scenes are good, but I still don't feel as if any Spider-Man films have lived up to the action from the Raimi films, particularly the third one which featured numerous great action scenes. Of course, the CGI was excellent, like in every MCU film.<br/><br/>Some problems I have are, as mentioned, the less than stellar fight scenes, and the bland love interest. I also felt as if this film featured more plot holes in conjunction with the rest of the MCU than normal, which was strange.<br/><br/>Overall though, it was really enjoyable and another fun entry into the ever expanding Marvel Cinematic Universe."
"secretzfan","7","0","3","12 July 2017"," Its nice and well done
","After seeing this film I didn't come out saying that it was the greatest film ever or the best one in the MCU, but instead saying this a a very cool take and also a very different take on the Spider Man character. Marvel defiantly understands Spider Man and understands his history and who he is supposed to be and I really felt that hear. It was nice to watch a Spider Man movie where the main actor really does feel like a kid who is just trying to survive life. And that much alone I really enjoyed and had a lot of fun. <br/><br/>The Vulture played by Micheal Keaton is also a very good villain for Peter Parker to face. The guy is truly scary and truly threatening as well and that was something I really enjoyed about the film. With most MCU films the villains are pretty meh for the most part, so it was nice to see a villain who was scary and made your worry for the hero's life. That was a definite positive. Also the fact that the villain didn't hurt the rest of the movie was good to. Cause Guardians had a good villain too but sadly it hurt the rest of the movie. <br/><br/>I also really enjoyed the Zendaya's character. I thought she was really charming and really funny too. She was a great and very interesting character to me who I defiantly enjoyed when she popped up on screen. There is also a twist with her character that I won't spoil. <br/><br/>Overall while not one of my favorite movies in the MCU I still had a good time. I had a lot of fun with it and would defiantly recommend it."
"mr_bickle_the_pickle","8","0","3","10 July 2017"," Spider-Man, Spider-man, can MCU do it? Yes it Can!
","I think they have finally got the character of Spider-man right. He's a great mix of the nerdy, uncool Peter Parker we went and the cocky, quipping Spider-Man. And while they do great with him and give him a good character arc, I think they failed for the most part with other characters. Zendaya's Michelle shows up here and there to say a quip and then disappears. Otherwise she's mainly thrown in as a set up for a future movie. Aunt May doesn't have much to do in this film besides be the ""hot Aunt"" that everyone hits on. Donald Glover is in the movie for 2 scenes and he also is mainly there as a potential set up for a future movie. The only other character that I felt was decently fleshed out was Adrian Toomes (Vulture). I think they gave him some good backstory for why he hated Iron Man/The Avengers so much. And there were several good fights between him and Spider-man where he had the upper hand. And there was a really great acted, tension filled moment between the two of them in a car. And that's all I say about that scene because I'm trying to keep this review as spoiler free as possible. I think he was one of the better villains. The other weird thing I want to point out, is the timeline doesn't make sense. When we are first introduced to Vulture, its right after the events of the first Avengers (which was like 2012 I believe) but then it cuts to an ""8 years later screen. Which either means this takes places in like 2020. Or The Avengers was taking place in like 2009. However, later in the film Happy Hogan makes a reference to something he's been holding onto since 2008 (which is when the first Iron Man came out). So......very confusing. I know some people don't like the fact that Iron Man built Spider-man's suit, but I think it makes sense for this universe and it does provide for a really funny scene once he gets the ""training wheels"" off and doesn't know how to use it because Tony went overboard with all the options. There is also plenty of other funny moments in the film, one of my favourites had to do with Ferris Bueller. I'm not sure how would I rank it amongst the other MCU movies. There's so many at this point, and I feel like I would have to do a re-watch. But, between the other MCU movie that came out this year, I think I enjoyed GOTG 2 a little bit more."
"cheyennesmith-762-532623","7","0","4","8 July 2017"," Definitely better than Andrew Garfield.
","Spiderman: Homecoming was a good movie, but I didn't think it was as much fun as the new Wonder Woman film that I recently watched. Although I'm more fond of Toby Maguire, I would say that Tom Holland is better that Andrew Garfield. I never like Garfield btw. His Spiderman suit also looked good in its cartoonish kind of way. Michael Keaton was a good choice for the Vulture. The Vulture suit was pretty cool and menacing. My only gripe about the Vulture is that he didn't have that much screen time. When the film starts, you get to see him for a couple minutes and about half an later, you get to seen him for another minute, etc. The part where Vulture finds out that Peter is Spiderman is when the action between Spiderman and Vulture actually starts. That's about an hour and a half into the movie. I was rather disappointed with Shocker. They only used him in a couple of brief scenes then quickly gets killed off. Then he quickly gets replaced with another one of Vulture's minions and they only used him for one brief scene. I was never that fond of Shocker, but it felt like a wasted opportunity to introduce him to the big screen. The one character I just did not like when Peter's classmate Michelle. She is the most unlikable character ever. Even more so than Flash Thompson. Every time you see her, she always makes some smart ass remark to Peter or his friend Ned. When you see her at Lizzie's party, she flips a bird at Peter when he first shows up. When Peter is in detention, she shows him a sketch she made of him being miserable with a cold look on her face. I the movie but I wouldn't call it outstanding. Out of all the movies that they made up till now. I would say homecoming is better than the Andrew Garfield movies, Spiderman 3, and underneath Spiderman and Spiderman 2."

","I really didn't fancy going to see Spider-Man: Homecoming but with there being no football at the moment and my youngest pestering me to go , I succumbed . I haven't really been into Spider-Man since the cartoon TV show of the seventies and with all the changes of lead actors I wasn't holding out great hope but I was pleasantly surprised. Thrilled by his experience with the Avengers, Peter Parker returns home under the watchful eye of his new mentor Tony Stark . Parker tries to fall back into his normal daily routine‚Äîdistracted by thoughts of proving himself to be more than just your friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man‚Äîbut when the Vulture (Michael Keaton) emerges as a new villain, he finds that there is a massive conflict between his Spidey life and his private life. Tom Holland is excellent as the new Spider-Man. He's playing a 15 year old Peter Parker and that will definitely appeal to the kids. In fact the whole film feels like it's aimed at the younger market. There is less death and destruction than a usual Avengers movie ( and this IS an Avengers movie) and more references to what teenagers are into. Some of the special affects are amazing especially one scene where Spider-Man climbs up the Washington Monument ( great in 3D) also a scene on a ferry. It could do with half an hour being shaved off of it but I think that of most Marvel films . Not Bad at all."
"nh-68611","7","0","3","8 July 2017"," *SPOILER REVIEW* The morning after viewing the film.
","Overall, I really did enjoy the film, getting it right off of my chest ‚Äì The orchestrated Spider-Man theme at the beginning was epic! I had a huge smile on my face as it took me back to my childhood of watching the cartoon and got me in great mood before the film got started.<br/><br/>This was definitely the best incarnation of Peter Parker that we have seen to date ‚Äì I had high hopes for him after seeing him in Civil War anyway and Tom Holland did not disappoint. Peter was appropriately aged and was portrayed as being nerdy, yet clever. <br/><br/>I really liked Holland's portrayal of Spider-Man, the fact that you could see him failing at certain webslings was good; this made it more believable, since if you tried doing it in real life, you'd almost certainly bump into things and injure yourself. ‚Äì It also made sense for that to be happening as the film was going for a 'coming of age story' for Spider-Man, rather than an origin story. Additionally, I really enjoyed the scene where he had nothing to latch his web onto and had to run; this is something I used to query a lot as a child, so it was great to see it acknowledged in a humorous way.<br/><br/>The Vulture was a great portrayal, much better than the cartoon series in my opinion. Michael Keaton was a great villain when he was just being Liz's dad ‚Äì very calm and calculating. I also really liked his origin story at the beginning of the film and how it tied into The Avengers.<br/><br/>All of the Avengers stuff was cool; Iron Man didn't overshadow Spidey, which I was pleased with. The new Avengers building looked great and helped to build up the hype for Infinity War. <br/><br/>Moving onto the weaker aspects of the film: Firstly, I wasn't too keen on Peter's best friend, Ned. Although he was moderately entertaining at times and it was good to see Peter have someone to nerd out with about Star Wars, I personally thought he was over-used and often slowed the film down. Furthermore, the pacing of the film was quite slow at times ‚Äì the scene when Spidey was locked in the storage room with the bomb was particularly slow; I remember briefly drifting off and checking my watch at that point.<br/><br/>I didn't like the fact that Vulture wasn't named as 'Vulture' in the film ‚Äì people who don't know Spider-Man might not even know he was supposed to be called that. Maybe it's just me, but I enjoy referring to heroes and villains by their proper names and not their human names. ‚Äì If you know what I mean?<br/><br/>No Spider sense! Or at least it didn't feel like he had it. I noticed this because Spidey got caught off guard a few times in the film ‚Äì for instance, when Vulture swooped down and picked him up; surely he should have sensed this?! However, he might still be developing this as he's learning throughout the film so it's kind of forgivable ‚Äì Maybe he'll have his Spider-Senses in the next one now that he's developed more as a hero. However, I'm not too keen on the fact that Spider-Man is now overly reliant on technology. He feels a bit too much like Iron Man rather than a radioactive teenager with spider powers. ‚Äì This is something that the Toby Maguire films, love them or hate them, portrayed the best in my opinion.<br/><br/>However, the biggest problem for me was the second half of the film, when Spidey had no suit at the end. I understand that the point is to develop him as a hero in his own right and to teach him a moral lesson, but I felt that too much time was invested into it and I was really disappointed that the final battle wasn't showing Spider-Man using the powers he was supposedly learning throughout his various training modes with Karen. <br/><br/>Furthermore, I hate that Tony Stark is allowed to say: ""If you're nothing without the suit, then you shouldn't have it."" ‚Äì Literally 'Pot/Kettle/Black'! ‚Äì Iron man without his suit is just rich. Even Captain America had the whole, ""Put on the suit"" fiasco with him in the first Avengers film so he really has no right to say this.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Spider-Man Homecoming was a good film; I enjoyed a lot of it. However, I felt that the first half of the film, watching Peter learning his suit powers and trying them out was a much more enjoyable portion and by this point I had great expectations to see these abilities come into play ‚Äì this made it far more disappointing to see them all scrapped towards the end. I felt that instead of showing Peter as a novice at the start and seeing him develop his powers and use them at the end, they went backwards and showed him have powers at the start and took them away. Therefore, in my opinion, this wasn't a perfect Spider-Man film, nor was it my favourite Marvel movie. I was happy with it, but I still feel that there was room for improvement."
"anupapu8","7","0","3","8 July 2017"," Felt more like a Marvel movie then a SONY product.
","SPIDERMAN HOMECOMING -Spiderman is back at home , and that's Marvel. Although it's wrong to say BACK because in movies he has never been at Marvel before.<br/><br/>At the start let me rank it among the other Spiderman movies . And it's just my personal ranking. Its third best for me after the best Spiderman 2 (which most of the people think is actually the best one) and Amazing Spiderman 1 (this one people may disagree). So you can say inclusion of Marvel gave mix results bending towards the positive side.<br/><br/>But I do think this movie felt more like a Marvel movie then the earlier Spiderman movies by SONY. Mostly because of the two reasons. 1st being the obvious one , inclusion of Iron Man and his Iron Manish Jokes. And the movie is full of them. Even when Iron Man is not their in the screen. And 2nd - casting of Tom Holland (for which credit goes to Kevin - the head of Disney and Russo Bros - the director of Cap America 2 and 3. And it's easy to say for me that Holland is the best Spiderman and fit perfectly with the tone of MCU. He looks exactly like a 15 year old school boy. And has a nice sense of humour.<br/><br/>This fact that Spidey is back in school gave the makers a chance to make the movie light hearted , full of jokes , lowering the stakes (I mean the world is not under any danger this time).<br/><br/>But then again the movie lacks Seriousness , Tension , Emotions , etc. No shock value. No edge of the seat scenes , no heart warming scenes like what I got in Wonder Woman. What I mean is that I had the usual problem I always have with the Marvel Movies. So that's just about my personal taste.<br/><br/>Also to add , about which I am not much sure but Spidey in this movie has been shown as pretty much incapable. Apart from the Climax fight , every time Iron Man has to come to rescue him . This may make hard core Spiderman fans a little disappointed. Just may be. Didn't bothered me. Because I am not that die hard fan.<br/><br/>The movie is too much crowded with characters. Not everyone get a meaty role having the running time of 133min. The best example is ZENDEYA , being just another student , having no real purpose , cracking dry jokes. May be she will get a little more important role in the sequel.<br/><br/>Being in High School , Peter was very immature . Apart from fighting street thugs he was tackling usual high school problems - bullying , failure to express his love to the senior girl , not having many friends and yes the most usual one BALANCING HIS PERSONAL LIFE WITH Professional , I MEAN SUPERHERO LIFE.<br/><br/>One of the great thing about this movie (which I think should be given credit to but I also think most of the audience will not be able to catch the fact ) is that how close the ambition of both the hero and the villain were in the movie. Both has been demoralized by Tony Stark and Both wants to prove something to Tony and to society. Yet both have a different way to do it.<br/><br/>Michal Keaton as vulture was good. For a change we got a nice villain in a Marvel movie. Again it's owned by SONY so it just half qualify as Marvel movie. Vulture is good , not great. He had a clear motive. He wants to do business. Trying to earn a standard lively-hood. Still I didn't find him enough menacing.<br/><br/>Action scenes were good. Not very unique creatively , but good. The broken ship pulling scene was very familiar to Toby Macquarie's train stopping scene from Spiderman 2 , but didn't reached the height of the tension which Toby's scene had done. No other complains from action. If only the climax scene had been done in the daylight instead of Night , would have been so much better.<br/><br/>The first half was very good. Extremely funny. But when the movie jumped to 2nd half the stakes should have been gone higher. Which never happens. Also whatever serious or sad scenes were there director was not able to make them gripping which is a shock because I loved the direction of John Watts in COP CAR.<br/><br/>There were some minor visual effects which looked more like Video Game scenes , but mostly visuals were great.<br/><br/>3d being always nice in Spiderman movies was good here too.<br/><br/>Robert Dn Junior had just the right amount of role neither overshadowing Spidey(if only we ignore the fact that he rescues him all the time) nor dissatisfying his own fans having a small role.<br/><br/>I love Marisa Tomei. She is extremely beautiful even at the age of 52 years. She is a perfect Aunt May. Would have been great if we had got some more emotional scenes of her with Peter.<br/><br/>Small thing to add. SHOCKER has always been one of my favorite villain from Spiderman Cartoon. And I always wanted him to be shown in movies. And I got it. Yes as a sidekick of vulture , not a very powerful villain but at least get a chance on big screen.<br/><br/>7.3/10 by ANuP APu KuMaR"

","Spider-Man Homecoming tells the coming of age tale Peter Parker as he struggles to balance school, family, and being a superhero and that's what it should be. This film brings Spider-Man back to his charm as what made Spidey so relatable was that he was not a larger than life superhero but one of us. Tom Holland does a phenomenal job portraying Peter Parker/ Spider-Man with his youthful charm, and infectious charisma, as does everybody else. One stand out in particular being Michael Keaton as the Vulture. Having significantly more depth than your standard MCU villain Michael Keaton delivers a joyfully over the top performance with a surprising amount of depth. However although this film does have a lot to love about there are still many flaws that may make it a disappointment for some viewers, one big one being that the film has no weight to it. Everything from the emotion to the action feels without any stakes and frankly just underwhelming. Where as every Spider-Man movie from this point had pretty exceptional action scenes (including The Amazing Spider-Man 2) this one included several jump cuts and no impact. There are also a few minor issues with the film, without getting into spoiler territory there was one scene in particular that was very clearly an advertisement for an Audi. Overall although I would still say Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 1 and 2 are still better this is undeniably a very fun enjoyable summer flick. As far as Marvel movies go I'd say this one's pretty great. And I'm giving this one a 7 or 8/10."
