","Whenever I see a movie that I get really excited about, I seek out reviews from professional critics and fellow fans. Often times they will point out things that I may not have noticed and it's exciting to feel connected to someone through art. When I find lots of negative reviews I begin to feel a sort of let down. I wonder if my opinion was ""wrong"", or why I'm the only one who liked it. Keep in mind; I'm an 18-year-old girl, so I have not yet grown out of such thoughts. I am also not an authority on film. Everything I know, I learnt from reading Roger Ebert and watching lots and lots of movies. However, this movie really stuck with me. I saw it 2 days ago and I still can't stop thinking about it. I decided to take a page out of Ebert's book and explain why I loved it (instead of just saying ""it's awesome""). Here's why: 1. The Children: I'm a sucker for kids in movies, especially when they actually get to act like kids. The 1-year-old Lily and 3-year-old Victoria are so beautiful that they tug at your heartstrings without even trying. They were well cast. 6-year old Lily and 8-year-old Victoria were truly phenomenal little actresses. Megan Charpentier (already a seasoned veteran with previous credits including Jennifer's Body, Red Riding Hood, and Resident Evil: Retribution) handles this heavy subject matter with maturity and poise. She manages to balance innocence with experience. She has been traumatized by her past, maybe her heart is a little harder than the average 8-year-old (if it wasn't, she wouldn't have survived all that time), but we still get glimpses of the little girl who just wants a mommy. Isabelle Nélisse is (in my opinion) genius as little Lily. I think CGI must have been used to make her movements appear more animalistic, but a child of her age maintaining such seriousness is riveting to watch. When she plays with her toys, it's like watching an actual feral child in a documentary (I repeat, it is LIKE watching a feral child, not IDENTICAL to).<br/><br/>2. The ""Parents"": Jessica Chastain and Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau as the uncle (and uncle's girlfriend) of the little girls are very well cast. I was a bit sceptical of Jessica Chastain's ""rocker chick"" look, but she brings such life and courage to her character that you actually see her as a bass player, instead of a classically beautiful Hollywood star trying to look like a bass player. I had never heard of Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau before this film. I love how much he loves the girls. His caring for them is so sincere and honest. You truly believe that he is the kind of guy who would spend 5 years (and money he doesn't have) on the hope that his nieces might still be alive. He is a loving father figure who doesn't get as much time with the girls as her should (in my humble opinion).<br/><br/>3. Mama: The demon/spirit/ghost/entity/whatchamacallit of Mama was created using CGI and a very tall, thin actor. Many audience members laughed when Mama first came in to full view. I agree that she looked a little funny. Her hair was really weird and anti-gravity (like Mama in the short film) and her face was oddly asymmetrical. However, I think that she was perfect. Just the right amount of creepy and sad. This is one of the only horror movies in existence that causes the audience to feel real sympathy for the evil villain.<br/><br/>4. The Director: I admire Andrés Muschietti for taking so many risks. It is rare to find a filmmaker today who will go against what the audience may want. He didn't use any fake scares; the situation was scary enough on its own. There are brilliant moments of natural humour that were so refreshing. He did not mock his characters or the situation, but he found the string of comedy that was there already and used it to his advantage. How many times have you been having a miserable day, and then just stopped and started laughing about how everything went wrong? That is the humour of Mama.<br/><br/>5. The Story: Part of the reason that I love horror movies is that they aren't bound by the usual visionary constraints of, say, Italian neo-realism films. Tragic stories are exciting and implausible all at the same time. I think that this was a very original take on a story of mother-daughter bonding. Of course there's no such thing as a ""completely original story"", but there is such thing as a completely original vision. The story affected me very deeply. I'm still trying to come to terms with how it ended.<br/><br/>6. Using Clichés Effectively: There are a lot of clichés involved in making a horror film. There are only so many ways to introduce the plot line of a supernatural being. This genre requires stock characters, and they do their jobs well. They use some of my favourite scare tactics (using a camera as a light source, unexpected appearances by the entity, etc...). Those particular clichés are necessary. Would you really want to see a Jim Carrey comedy where he uses dry humour and no body language? Or a Baz Luhrman film with dull colours and understated characters? Clichés are not always a bad thing.<br/><br/>This is why I loved this film. Agree or disagree, but you can't say I didn't think it through.<br/><br/>Take care, -Hannah"

","Mama is directed by Andres Muschietti and written by Muschietti, Barbara Muschietti and Neil Cross. It stars Jessica Chastain, Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, Megan Charpentier, Isabelle Nelisse, Daniel Kash, Javier Botet and Jane Moffat. Music is by Fernando Velazquez and cinematography by Antonio Riestra.<br/><br/>A Suicidal father abducts his two young daughters and takes them to a cabin out in the woods, his intention is to kill them. Before he can enact his plan he is killed by a strange entity, leaving the two girls alone in the cabin. Years later the girls are discovered in the cabin, completely feral and when any sense can finally be made out of them, they talk of being looked after by someone they call Mama; And it seems Mama has come back with them to civilisation<br/><br/>Based on his own 2008 Argentinian short of the same name, Andres Muschietti expands the idea out to a full length feature film. With pretty decent results as well. Pic is a supernatural fairytale, thick on ethereal atmosphere and not over reliant on boo jumps or an adherence to blood and guts spilling just to put bums on seats. From the moment the girls are found, scampering around the wood cabin on all fours, clearly having survived on cherries for five years, there's an uneasy feel to the story. We already know there is a spirit involved as we half glimpsed ""Mama"" during the pre-credits sequence, what we need now is a good story and a healthy quota of frights and peril for Waldau and Chastain as they become surrogate parents to the troubled youngsters; And again, Mama mostly delivers all that is required of it for a good night in by the fire whilst perched on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>Chastain is excellent as the punk rock chick reluctantly mothering two children before her time, the two girls, Charpentier and Nelisse, are also top draw, exuding the sadness and confusion that children of that age would obviously be feeling under these circumstances. While their reactions to what we ourselves can't see, via glances or hushed exchanges, has a creepiness to it that delivers a bucket load of dread. Muschietti's direction is very stylish, not only does he marshal his principal cast members with great skill, he shows some ingenuity in scene staging with one sequence particularly brilliant as Chastain does housework and the younger of the girls plays with Mama in the bedroom, we know it, even though we can only see the wee bairn. The soundtrack and score is suitably screechy, and the cinematography by Riestra has Gothic tints to it.<br/><br/>Why Mama is not a bona fide entry in the upper echelons of horror is mainly due to an annoying mistake that so many horror genre film makers make, namely showing too much of the spook. There is a point around the hour mark where ""Mama"" herself just stops being scary, a shame because the effects work isn't half bad. There's other, less itchy problems, such as Waldau being reduced to a bit player from the mid-point, a sub-plot involving Kash's Dr. Dreyfuss just feels like set-up material, while the ending is sure to be a bit too WTF for some. That said, this is good genre cinema for those who like The Woman in Black type of thrills and story telling. 7.5/10"
"DICK STEEL","8","147","212","18 January 2013"," A Nutshell Review: Mama
","The title may be tacky, but this Canadian-Spanish co-production, with Guillermo del Toro lending his name as producer, is one of the better horror films to have come out from the West in recent years, despite being filled with the usual clichés, actually contain a proper story, and delivered really well in terms of chills, thrills and everything that's necessary to creep you out and make you jump at your seat. Co-written and directed by Andres Muschietti, Mama shows how it boils down to story, building upon his short film of the same name some 5 years ago, and a solid cast to gloss over the expected bag of tricks.<br/><br/>Many of the clichés were put to good effect, which in some ways you'd come to expect certain things to happen in a certain way, and they did. While it may be blunted in terms of anticipation and build up, it didn't shy away from delivering that sucker punch when required, and kept good work in framing and editing for maximum impact when the moment called for the unabashed dip into tried and tested elements. One thing you'll note is how assured Muschietti's direction is, as if doing it all for the very first time, with the aim of wanting to stir up its scares really well. Liberal use of CG also helped, but never done in slip-shoddy fashion, which added a layer of positive production values to the film.<br/><br/>I mean, there's creepy children, a ghoul that gate-crashes a reunion of sorts, and the usual spooky house no thanks to noises during strange timings, and the rote blinking of lights. All ingredients that you've seen utilized to the death in various horror film productions, but coming together really well in Mama, playing to the strengths of these elements while fiercely ignoring the negativity associated with lazier filmmakers who just slap these elements together, expecting them to work. It's not a special effects extravaganza when it's not required, and Mama showed just how its story and characters were allowed to lead, rather than to have strangely illogical moments, even for a horror film, fall coincidentally into place.<br/><br/>Jessica Chastain may be the latest IT girl in Hollywood, and it's encouraging to note she's really going all out to take on various roles in different genres, despite her more recent art house leanings of late. Here, she's the quintessential scream queen, albeit only just, given her role of Annabel being a rock star wannabe, sporting almost full body tattoos that betray a rather soft demeanour, when her maternal instincts get called upon to look after the nieces of her boyfriend Lucas (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau). They were found after having disappeared for five years, which the opening sequence and credits would have pointed to an unnatural upbringing under the hands of the titular Mama ghoul. Battling for custody, it is with reluctance that the couple take the children under their wing, probably because Annabel knows she'll eventually be dumped with the kids, which did happen.<br/><br/>And the entire middle act is when the fun begins, for fans of horror films forking out good money to be entertained with the roller coaster ride of scares. Muschietti and his story collaborators Neil Cross and Barbara Muschietti managed to keep an entire back story up their sleeves, to reveal them in teasing fashion, which worked to keep you engaged throughout. And credit must go to Muschietti and his DP Antonio Riestra for having framed the initial introduction to the ghoulish elements that went for maximum WTF surprises, especially with sleight of hand techniques that didn't jar the narrative, nor relied on the necessity of a jump cut edit to hammer home its creepier moments. It grows, slowly, and that's one master stroke Mama had that worked wonders.<br/><br/>This is the second film in a row that had its child actors provide top notch performances. Megan Charpentier and Isabelle Nelisse play sisters, who with the aid of CG move around complete with unnatural mannerisms, having it in term to creep you out, before having to develop their characters into emotional cores that added a lot more depth to this film as it steamrolls its way to the finale. Andres Muschietti is the name to watch now for taking something that's expected to be cliché in a horror film, but fulfilled more than you'd bargain for. A definite recommend!"
"estebangonzalez10","5","87","123","6 May 2013"," Begins with a lot of promise, but ends with an unsatisfying note
","¨A ghost is an emotion bent out of shape, condemned to repeat itself time and time again.¨<br/><br/>Another South American director has made his splash on Hollywood after the successful debut of Mama in theaters this year. Argentinean director, Andres Muschietti, made over 70 million dollars in the box office and received decent reviews for this horror/suspense film based on a short 3 minute movie he directed in 2008. That short film garnered the attention of movie executives such as Guillermo Del Toro who decided to produce and present this film. The fact that Del Toro's name was used here and that the coveted Jessica Chastain signed on to play the main character gave Muschietti the tremendous possibility of debuting on a high note. The formula worked pretty well because critics and audiences seemed to enjoy this film alike, and we could be heading to the start of a new horror franchise. I enjoyed most of the movie, and loved Jessica Chastain's performance, but the ending just ruined the entire film for me. It is kind of the same problem pretty much every ghost story film has. I feel like most of the endings in this genre are pretty unsatisfying and ruin the entire suspense the film has been building throughout the story. There is no denying that Japanese films have heavily influenced the genre with films such as The Ring, The Grudge, Dark Water, and One Missed Call which have all been remade, but the truth of the matter is the only film that really worked with critics was The Ring. They have tried to imitate its success, but I haven't been scared like I was with The Ring, which had a pretty satisfying ending compared to the rest. I do prefer this type of psychological horror more than the gory slasher films, but I find it troubling that they can't find a satisfying ending. My favorites in this genre will always be the first two I saw: Zemeckis's What Lies Beneath and The Ring. The rest have all fallen short. Mama was close to achieving that similar success in my opinion, but the ending really hurt it.<br/><br/>The film centers around two girls named Lilly (Isabelle Nelisse) and Victoria (Megan Charpentier) who are abandoned in a cabin in the middle of the woods after their father murdered their mother and was attacked by some presence inside the cabin. Five years later the search finally pays off and their Uncle Lucas (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) finds them. To everyone's surprise the two girls have managed to survive on their own, but they live like animals crawling around the floor and talking to walls. Lucas and his girlfriend, Annabel (Jessica Chastain) decide to raise the kids with the help of Dr. Dreyfuss (Daniel Kash) who continues to treat the girls in order for them to make the transition from their isolated lives to a normal and nurturing family life. Annabel soon discovers that these girls might have never been on their own and that somehow the presence that was with them in the cabin might be in their home as well. Several suspenseful and horrifying events begin to take place while the girls continue to talk to shadows in the walls and call out for Mama.<br/><br/>The film has several thrills and suspenseful moments with a great performance from Jessica Chastain. It was good to see her try out a different role and she proves she can do about everything. It's hard to find good performances in horror films, but this may be one of the best. The movie also has its weaknesses like pretty much all horror films do considering the protagonists always seem to make stupid decisions, but that is what makes the genre so entertaining at times. They are clichés which we have learned to accept. The two girls were also surprisingly good, they had strong performances as well. I really enjoyed everything about the movie up to the last 15 minutes which pretty much ruined everything. Psychological thrillers usually have this impact: they begin with a lot of promise but end up on the wrong note, and that is exactly how I felt about Mama along with Sinister, a similar movie I got to see a few months ago. The film is above average thanks to Jessica Chastain, and Guillermo Del Toro's influence in the production of the movie, but that is about it. <br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"

","I went into this film with high expectations. I am a horror movie junkie, despite their general lack of critical acclaim. They should be entertaining, even if they don't give you nightmares. After first viewing the trailer over the summer (rolling in for The Possession), I eagerly anticipated the January release. Seeing that Guillermo del Toro's name was attached to the project made me even more giddy. I saw it opening night.<br/><br/>I was not disappointed. Not in the slightest. In fact, I was happier with the movie than I intended to be. Believe me, that's saying something.<br/><br/>Not one scared by stories themselves, but solely by moments that utilize the element of surprise, I have never jumped out of my skin more times during a single film than I did for ""Mama."" That pretty much makes it the scariest movie that I have ever seen. However, seeing as different things scare different people, that is most likely not the same for everyone. If you aren't a jumper, don't worry, it's still very much worth it.<br/><br/>The story is not your typical ghost story. It has a terrific exposition to settle you into the film's focus. The situation is solitary enough that you won't yourself experience it, but isn't so far-fetched that it's unbelievable. The characters are both likable and flawed, which gives them dimension and makes them more interesting. And the girls are adorable, but not so cute that it detracts from the terror. As you can see, the film is very much balanced. A good film needs that balance.<br/><br/>As far as scares go, some are quite subtle. A few you don't particularly realize are happening until something changes, and you're caught off-guard. Seeing that the premise is supernatural, the idea of an elusive antagonist is key. You can't see too much of what you're supposed to be afraid of, and for the majority of the movie, you don't. The cloud of mystery surrounding Mama herself is hauntingly beautiful, and will both demonize and delight you. By the time you finish it, you will most likely feel both happy and sad, and will not know where your emotions should be.<br/><br/>I highly recommend ""Mama"" to anyone, because it is not your stereotypical horror movie. Its distinct lack of gore, and high level of well-crafted story, makes for an exciting experience for both horror lovers, and those who don't necessarily appreciate the genre. If you get the chance to watch it, take it immediately. If you aren't given the chance to watch it, make the chance yourself."

","I am a big fan of horror but recently i cant remember a movie which i enjoyed to my heart but then i saw MAMA and it was like a fresh air which u asked from a long long time. What makes MAMA special and different is it's Story and Acting.Not many horror movies has it now a days but MAMA has it all..a beautiful and emotional film with great horror elements to back it.The performance from Jessica Chastain is mind blowing.when the movie starts I didn't seem to connect with her character but as soon as the movie progressed she just blown my mind with her screen presence and screen fit performance.few places r just brilliant like the one where she finds lily outside of the house and she brings her in but Lily tries to escape but the she holds he tight and make her feel that she loves her from within and Lily starts looking at her with innocence and Jessica hold her hands blow air on them and ask Lily that ""dose she liked it""..it moved me and i was just speechless watching it.Just little more detailing would have turned it into a classic for life.but never then less its one of the finest horror film I watched in decades.<br/><br/>Highly recommended.Loved it!"
"themoviejunkie91","10","153","241","19 January 2013"," Mama delivers the terror while building a exceptional story for a horror film.
","""MAMA"", a film executively produced by Del Toro follows the story of two little girls that are found in the wilderness for five years. They are then adopted by their Uncle Luke (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) and his girlfriend Annabel (Jessica Chastain)and right off the bat, strange things start happening. While trapped in the woods, Victoria (Megan Charpentier)and Lily (Isabelle Nelisse) formed a guardian to protect and care for them, who they call Mama.<br/><br/>This is an excellent movie. Be warned that it does remain dependant on jump scares to scare you, but they are what I like to call ""true jump scares"". Not a cat bursting out of a corner, or a shoe falling from the sky. ""Mama"" utilizes CGI by creating dark, disturbing images along with a tense orchestral sound track to scare your pants off. The acting was also superb, particularly Jessica Chastain and Megan Charpentier. Isabelle was solid also, but I had a feeling that before every take, she was told what to do, but Megan was old enough to understand the script and story. Something that really impressed me was how the story unfolded, and how beautifully the mother daughter relationship was portrayed. The cinematography was also one of the most beautiful jobs I've ever seen on a horror film. Camera work was steady and the dolly shots were smooth and suspenseful. Overall, Mama was a terrifying horror movie with a beautiful story and wonderful camera work. I hope this movie is recognized as a classic for years to come. This movie also proves that PG-13 horror movies can be scary after all. 9/10."
"billygoat1071","8","65","100","18 February 2013"," Amending The Horror Story
","Horror has been one of the least appreciated film genres nowadays for relying nothing more than the excessive amount of violence and repetitive jump scares, plodding the storytelling by its completely lifeless characters who are ready to get killed. Mama is something else however it still has those horror movie clichés, like those easy loud jump scares and some ghostly pathos, but there is a fascinating concept behind the scares that leaves the audience a beautiful story than just a cheap horror shock. It also has a set of strong performances and solid production. It could have been much genuine in being scary than simply loud but Mama is still one of the great horror films we got in a while.<br/><br/>Unlike most modern horror films, this movie's ambition is to tell a compelling story. Obviously there is a hidden emotion beneath the concept, but before we get to that, it explores around the characters and the gloomy atmosphere. Rather than throwing a horrific death scene to show fear, it scatters some symbolic objects that indicate the presence of the titular monster. It's a fascinating trick of manifesting its mysteries and fear. What defy the odds of the genre are the characters. They are not only ought to get scared. This is a rare set of modern horror characters that possesses a genuine soul. The performances handle them terrifically. There is a lot of remarkable performance to talk about but anyway. It's not only about the scares. It finely balances the drama to the darkness of the story. Personally, it's kind of more interesting when it simply tells the story of the two kids and the Mama ghost even though it features a horror cliché of ghosts telling their past to the central character. In the end, we'll realize the film actually offers more to the picture.<br/><br/>The only largest misstep they had is the excessive amount of loud jump scares. Though, they can be effective at some point. They still used some other ways of scaring the audience, like mimicking the clever horror trick of ""The Orphanage"" and letting the character be alone exploring the creepiness going on. It could have lingered on those parts to feel the danger of the characters, but instead they immediately send off a loud jump scare because it works to everyone. The film uses some CGI which made the monsters look a bit awkward but they are decent enough. Everything looks great in general. The cinematography and the production are a total pay off. It's just beautiful to look at.<br/><br/>Mama turns out to be pretty good. At glance, it doesn't look like the kind of horror film we usually thought about but furthermore we get to realize it is beyond than we should expect. The clichés still exists but they are used in a better way. Putting aside those cheap scares, it's a refreshing story that is indeed worth telling. It's still far from classic but it is also far from generic and annoying like most horror films we get these days. The performances and the filmmaking give more to the experience. Mama is the kind of horror film that abandons the gruesome acts and rather shows its dark aspects in a quite endearing way."
"cblakeJoey","8","71","116","19 January 2013"," Mama has flaws, but great concept
","I really liked this movie and the concept for it was original. I think this film makes the viewer think about what the characteristics are of being a mother. What sort of instincts we as woman can display and what kind of connections can be made with a child, even if you're a terrifying ghost.<br/><br/>Del Toro will always put his name on a good thriller surrounding small children. This movie had all the thrills of a scary movie and the elements fright used in the film had everyone in my theater on the edge of the seat. The movie waist no time getting into the meat of the story.<br/><br/>There are flaws in the film and it does have to do with plot holes. The director could have worked these holes out with other writers......like Del Toro perhaps. The back story had the hugest gap of all.<br/><br/>Regardless, it was better than 'Don't be Afraid of the Dark', and I will be seeing this film again."

","When sisters Lily and Victoria are left in the woods after a series of horrific events leaves them orphaned, how would they survive for the next five years until they are eventually rescued? Have no fear, Mama is here. The debut feature from Spanish director Andres Muschietti has some plot hole, but still delivers the goods in a scary, almost poignant way.<br/><br/>In Mama, there are similarities to the American version of The Ring in the way some of the scenes are shot in that grainy, static, antiquated, black and white style. Horror/ghost film fans might think parts of the film are clichéd and they would be correct. However, the two sisters in the film (played by Megan Charpentier and Isabelle Nelisse) make for interesting viewing. As Victoria and Lilly, the two are feral creatures having lived in the wild the bulk of their lives. Even after being taken in by their uncle (Game Of Thrones' Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, Lilly still prefers to run around on all fours, eat with her hands while on the floor, and sleep under her bed. Her speech is relegated to growls and grunts with a few words mixed in. Her big sister, Victoria has a faster time assimilating to the civilized world. She even begins to cozy up to her uncle's punk rock girlfriend Annabel (Jessica Chastain).<br/><br/>What makes Mama work is the relationship between the female characters. Chastain ( Take Shelter, Zero Dark Thirty) has the lead role. She's the girlfriend, but becomes the unwilling stepmom to the two girls. The girls accept her to different degrees, but still cling to each other first and foremost. They also cling to ""Mama"" and vice versa. Thus what you have is a battle of wills between the supernatural and the living world with the emotional and physical well being of two little girls hanging in the balance. Maybe the presence of Barbara Muschietti (sister of the director) as one of the producers and writers of the film had some influence on having women as the driving force.<br/><br/>In addition, Mama might feel and look like the style of Guillermo del Toro film. That could be because he executive produced the film. If you are familiar with his work, you can see his hand in guiding this maiden voyage. Even so, Mama stands on it's own merits. It's far from perfect. The acting, especially from the kids, some trippy and macabre imagery , and a bit of a twist might make you want to sleep with the lights on."

","Mama (2013) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4)<br/><br/>A couple (Jessica Chastain, Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) take in their two young nieces five years after they were kidnapped by their father and spent the majority of that time alone and in the wilderness. The two girls slowly start to come out of their state but it doesn't take long for the couple to realize that there's something else with them. MAMA is a feature length version of a short film by the director and for most part it's a successful horror film. There are a few problems that we'll get to but for the most part I thought director Andres Muschietti did a fine job at really creating a dark atmosphere that hangs around the entire film. He also managed to use this atmosphere and make it very effective during many of the scenes, which were quite creepy at times. I thought that really made the film stand out compared to so many other stories was the character played by Chastain. In most films like this you have the good person doing good deeds to protect the ones she loves. That's not the case here because her character doesn't want these girls, doesn't like how they've changed her life and there's not really any cute scenes. The character development here is something quite rare in horror films but I think it really works itself out nicely. As for Chastain, it's good that some of her caliber is here because a great performance really helps bring credit to the events in the film. The supporting players are good too and this is especially true of the two actresses playing the girls. Now, what really doesn't work in the film is the CGI ""mama"" character. I'm sorry but I really don't see why you have to have poor looking CGI bring a film down. Not only is the CGI rather poor but the ghost creation just does so many unrealistic things that you can't help but not be frightened of it. The director does a good job at building up the tension but once the creature actually comes it goes away. Still, MAMA is a pretty strong horror film that's not perfect but it's certainly good enough to watch."
"3xHCCH","7","26","41","29 January 2013"," Visually Stunning and Emotionally Charged!
","""Mama"" is the first big horror film release of the year, so as a horror movie fan, I really wanted to watch this. It has the name of Guillermo del Toro, not as director as I first thought, but as a producer, so we expected fantastic visuals. I was pleasantly surprised to see Jessica Chastain there too, looking like I have not seen her before, sporting a short dark Joan Jett-hairstyle. This film really had a lot going for it.<br/><br/>""Mama"" is a malevolent female spirit who jealously hounds the couple Annabelle (Jessica Chastain) and Luke (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) who adopts a couple of young girls who had been found living wildly in an abandoned cabin in the woods. Throughout this movie, in the way of disturbing dreams and jarring apparitions, we join Annabelle try to discover what exactly ""Mama"" wants that she cannot seem to get. <br/><br/>First-time feature film director Andrés Muschietti succeeds to create a horror film that was visually stunning as it was emotionally charged. The stylish look may have been influenced by the producer, Guillermo del Toro. The emotional ride was largely due to the restrained yet effective performance of Jessica Chastain as a single rocker-chick who was suddenly given the unexpected and unwelcome responsibility of being a step-mother to two very disturbed girls.<br/><br/>The one drawback for me was ""Mama"" herself, particularly how she looked. I admit I did not really like how she reminded me so much of Sadako (of the ""Ring"" films) in all its obvious computer-generated glory. However, the camera angles used to show ""Mama"" and her point of view were quite innovative. There were gaping plot holes when you think the story through and try to give explanations to ""Mama""'s illogical behavior. But hey, she is a crazy ghost after all! Just sit back, imbibe the creepy atmosphere and feel the emotion in the story."
"mloomis92","1","80","144","19 January 2013"," Newer isn't always better : how CGI turns horror into comedy
","Let me start off by saying I never and i mean never post reviews but this movie was so bad I feel like it is my duty as a human being to warn the world of this abomination. <br/><br/>Where to start...OK lets start with the positives. The movie starts off as a respectable film and what appears to be an interesting concept at first. The acting is pretty good considering the script they had to work with. I want to clarify it is not the actors fault for how bad this movie is.<br/><br/>Now for the negatives, the movie starts to fall apart the more you see Mama and all of her computer generated glory. She looks like a distorted Sarah Jessica Parker but far less scary than the real SJP. Its really hard to be scared of something that looks so unreasonably fake! I mean Disney's the haunted mansion staring Eddie Murphy has scarier CGI. Saying everything scary happens in the trailer would be far too kind because it wouldn't mention all the hilariously bad moments where Mama and her victims just stare at the camera making goofy Neanderthal faces. The cgi (which i can not stress enough was a total joke) was not even the worst part. The plot that seemed original in the beginning turns out to be as generic as possible and one really lame ass ghost story. I can't decide the worst part of it all, it has to be either how unlikeable the main protagonist was or the egregiously bad ending/overall plot. The main protagonist is a ""rock star"" who is selfish at first and just an all around douche. She is completely self absorbed and immature and than just magically out of no where becomes a mother figure and loves these two girls and they some how love her after just 3 days. Once again the actors are not to blame, they did their jobs the best they could given what they had to work with.<br/><br/>**Spoiler** Overall summery of Mama's plot:<br/><br/>Two little girls are raised by a ghost who...yep you guessed as it is trying to make up for the child she lost. The girls are found and given a home and new family by their aunt and uncle. Uncle gets put in a comma and aunt who isn't quite ready to raise children is left to raise them and falls in love with them like 3 days later. they are haunted by what could be the lamest ghost since Bill Cosby as ghost dad. Oh whats this? Giving mama her real baby back makes her stop haunting us? No way!!! Mama goes away taking one of the girls but leaving the other for some reason but not before literally punching a hole in the uncles heart....but its OK some how hes totally fine. The end"
"drakula2005","10","53","97","19 January 2013"," An Unforgettable Experience Brought By Muschietti, Del Toro and Chastain ! !
","First of all, my fellow moviegoers and horror-fans, i must begin by saying, that, even in a decade's time, i doubt that my instant love for this film would have changed in any way.<br/><br/>Was it because of the wonderful work of the entire cast and crew on the film that struck me?Or even that rare feeling you get, when a film has been carefully nurtured with love and selflessness and raised up to be one of the best in the genre to come out for a good long while?Or is it the wonderful Jessica Chastain with a little mix of Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau's assuring performance as Lucas, and of course, Isabelle Nélisse's and Megan Charpentier haunting performances of Lilly and Victoria.<br/><br/>And once we are rolling and underway, Muschietti and Del Toro never really let us go.Their ideas, their intelligence and vision, along with some brilliant acting, made this film a special cinematic experience.<br/><br/>Suspense and horror wise the filmmakers have made a wise choice not to go with blood, gore and other clichés nowadays horrors are filled to the brim with.Another great choice is the masterful cast they have chosen-Chastain, Waldau the whole cast.And since i'm very fond of Chastain, i will get on the subject thoroughly in a moment.The film was shot in incredible style not revealing in the opening scenes and ,step by step, showing more and more, both story and emotional wise.Not only that, but with the titular character of Mama, we find more about her, we see more of her, and in the end, we experience what means being her, being all of them.This storytelling arc i found very suspenseful and the great character development in Annabel and Victoria, the bigger sister, lead up to the climax, which is very heavy on emotions, pain and a triumph of the director's extraordinary vision.<br/><br/>Which, in my humble opinion, leads to the strongest quality, that this film has in it's possession:the cast!!Game of Thrones's Waldau does a really solid job portraying Lucas, the uncle, who never gave up on his nieces and kept searching, when nobody else did, he never let go.<br/><br/>Isabelle Nélisse and Megan Charpentier are great playing the two wild, insecure, girls and manage to find the perfect line between this world and the civilization they are so reluctantly brought into by their uncle and his girlfriend.Although the word ""girlfriend"" is very misleading in this situation, it does no justice to the relationship between Chastain's Annabel and Waldau's Lucas at all.Throughout the whole movie we have seen real love and real human feeling, not just a bunch of teens sleeping together and fooling around which basically happens in every horror movie.But here, people are full-blooded, real, emotional, humane.So, they clearly love each other, after all Annabel stayed with him in order to help him raise his nieces, they moved in a new house together, she left her life of the tattooed, beer-drinking, guitar-playing, Rooney Mara-resembling woman, that was not yet ready to be a mother.At the end, Annabel has become so fond of the girls, that she takes the role of a real mother, caring, protecting and loving them, when Lucas in not around.She is risking her own life for them and is gifted with the love of the bigger sister, Victoria, in return, which ultimately proves to be at the center of the main conflict-the unconditional love of two mothers towards the two sisters, and the choice that they have to make.A real mother, or Mama-a hurt, but jealous ghost, with a history of her own, a mother, who is able to take a life in order to preserve it, a mother, who defended the two children for years in the wild, as if they were her own, but not a real, full-blooded mother at all...There is no right choice here, which means things are ultimately going to end bad in one way or another...<br/><br/>So, for those who were able to bear with me for so long, i'm going to wrap it all in a nutshell:this film is an experience, that needs to be seen, an experience, resembling a beautiful, but also painful story with no winners and real, human emotions.It reminds me of Nicole Kidman's The Others in a way...And being introduced to Jessica Chastain's warm and full-blooded portrayal of an otherwise clichéd character, that she shows has been played the wrong way all those years, is the most important experience for me.She was brilliant, and as i have grown to love Chastain for her roles in the past two years, for her devotion and skillfulness, she is the best choice for this role.If horror movies had more overall quality and were higher-regarded as movies not only made for the purpose of cheap jumps, but for enjoying a piece of film making of real cinematic value, in a world where scripts are better, Jessica Chastain could even get nominated for an Oscar among other high-profile awards for her mesmerizing and beautiful, yet humane portrayal of a forced-by-the-circumstances mother, ready to do anything to protect the ones she loves.<br/><br/>So, with the 1000-word limit upon me, for one of the best films in the genre for the last years and a wonderful film as a whole, this piece of devoted filmmaking and acting, will keep you mesmerized until the very end and you'll be discussing it even afterward.It definitely left an impression on me, and i can't wait to see the beautiful Chastain again, as soon as possible, as she has proved to be equally impressive and devoted in every genre she has worked in and every role she has taken.The one-two, that's shaping up at the U.S. box-office this weekend for her, proves she covers more cinematic ground than most, and that the future is bright in her presence!I wish her the Lead Actress Oscar this year, as she absolutely deserves it for her work on Zero Dark Thirty!<br/><br/>My rate:a deserved 10/10 !!!"
"jaxbubba","1","52","98","2 February 2013"," Just plain awful
","If I had to summarize the review of this film into just two words, those words would have to be, ""Gawd Awful"" or ""Pure Stupidity""; both statements equally and eloquently captivate the essence of unbelievable stench that this film exudes. Written and Directed by Andres Muschiette, it's actually quite comical to count how many times both he as his wife Barbara's names appear on the screen during the film's opening credits. Rated PG13, this film is further justification as to why you should not bother seeing horror movies geared toward younger tween audiences.<br/><br/>The film centers around two sisters, Victoria and Lilly. After their father shoots and kills his business partner and their mother, he flees the scene of the crime with the two siblings in tow. High speeds and icy roads lead to an auto accident in the middle of nowhere. This motley crew is able to find shelter in an abandon house in the middle of the woods; however, with no food or water, Jeffrey decides to shoot the siblings. Before Jeffrey can pull the trigger of his gun, an entity (Mama) sweeps into the house and whisks Jeffrey away to oblivion. <br/><br/>In the five years that follow, Jeffrey's brother Lucas is still seeking closure to the events which occurred has hired trackers to comb the surrounding woods in hopes of finding his lost brother and nieces. The trackers stumble upon the abandon cabin, where the two sisters (more animal than human) still reside. The authorities are notified, and after a lengthy child custody hearing the two siblings are placed with their Uncle Lucas, with visitation rights granted to his sister-in-law Jean, and child counseling sessions arranged with Dr. Dreyfuss. As you may assume with a film of this nature, the Mama entity is not eager to lose her two adopted children, and thus follows them to their new dwelling. Also the Mama entity is just a tad bit jealous, so in an act of rage she inadvertently throws Uncle Lucas down a flight of stairs putting him into a coma This action brings us to Lucas' wife, Annabel, played by Jessica Chastain. Receiving incredible accolades for her role in 'Zero Dark Thirty', I can only imagine the horrors that must have been racing through her mind when she heard the studio decided to move up the release timeline for this film to capitalize on all her new found fame.<br/><br/>Anyways, to make a long story short, it seems the Mama entity is destine to remain on Earth until it can right its wrong. In this particular instance, she is trying to find her lost baby. Forced to jump off a cliff with her child in her arms when she was alive, she was separated from her baby in the fall. If the movie would have followed the rules that it established, then the film may not have been better; however, it would have at least made sense. In the films climatic conclusion, where Mama entity and dead baby carcass are finally reunited, the heavens should have opened up, and the two should have ascended into eternal bliss but did this happen???? Oh no, that would have made complete and utter sense to this completely ridiculous film. Instead writer/director Muschietti decides that the Mama entity should leap off the cliff with her new improved living daughters.<br/><br/>This is definitely one of those films in which you have to ask yourself, ""Well, what happened the following day?"" In the span of twenty-four hours, Dr. Dreyfuss, sister-in-law Jean, and youngest sibling Lilly are all dead, only Lucas, Annabel, and Victoria know what happened and that a vengeful ghost was the culprit. So as they are explaining all this to the police, do you think that they would get prison or psycho-ward?<br/><br/>This is truly a horrendous film and a total waste of Hollywood resources. To even associate Guillermo del Toro's (Pan's Labyrinth) name to this project is insulting and misleading. I cannot recommend seeing this film. You would be best serviced to avoid seeing this film.<br/><br/>See more of my reviews on FB @ ""The Faris Reel"""
"cornflakeboy20","6","50","94","17 January 2013"," Jessica Chastain is the only good thing about this
","""Mama"" concerns two young girls abandoned in the woods by their murderous father, who went on a killing spree following an unexplained financial crisis. His story is never really resolved, and its point is only to deliver the girls to the woods. The girls take refuge in an empty cabin and are overseen by a protective spirit. They are found later by a doctor in a feral condition and taken in by their uncle and his edgy, band member girlfriend (Jessica Chastain), who is reluctant to take on any kind of parental role. We soon find out that the spirit of ""Mama"" follows the girls and is protective and jealous of any other parental figure in the girls' lives. After the uncle is injured after a fright from the spirit, Chastain's character has to take on the role of sole protector, and comes to find affection for the girls. The arrival of Mama's spirit is heralded by moths, whose symbolism is never quite clear, though perhaps they represent reincarnation.<br/><br/>This movie started out as averagely good PG-13 horror. There are no false scares in the movie; all the jumps have payoffs. Chastain's character is well-drawn and I'm impressed with her ability to transform physically and sink emotionally into a role. Her role might be appealing to women who are sick of seeing brain dead maternal type women as caretakers in horror movies.<br/><br/>Soon, however, a lot of the plot devices become laughable. Flashback scenes do not quite make sense and are filmed in a bizarre jerky daguerreotype style that made the preview audience laugh. A throwaway librarian character (a harbinger, if you've seen Cabin in the Woods) gives a ridiculous, melodramatic speech about ghosts and their unresolved conflicts that prompted unintended laughter. There are logical inconsistencies as well. Upon the discovery of the girls (five years later, we are told), it appears that the crashed car is just yards off of the main highway and the cabin not too far from that. The cabin has some modern touches that lead us to believe it is not as old as the spirit that inhabits it. There is a scene of possession of a minor character that is very poorly handled and finds no great resolution. And, typical for horror, it seems whenever the characters go in to search the cabin it's always the dead of night.<br/><br/>I will not describe the ending, but many people will feel cheated and offended at the vagueness and lack of satisfactory comeuppance. Some may feel we've followed the story for nothing, or have been lead to sympathize with the wrong characters when the movie wants us to follow other characters' trajectories.<br/><br/>All in all, I'd wait to stream this one and skip paying for it theatrically."
"rgkarim","7","28","52","19 January 2013"," Not Jump out at you scary, but creepy
","Horror movies are indeed a genre that is always a hit or miss for me. Sometimes they deliver the chills they intend, but many of the modern scary films are filled with too much cheesiness to make me jump or shriek in terror. So once again I went to my local theater to check out the latest Hollywood horror entitled Mama, starring one of my favorite actresses Jessica Chastain. Like so many of her films, I looked forward to being entertained by the lovely redhead and hopefully by the movie as well. So what does this movie have in store for you? Read on to find out.<br/><br/>From my experiences, many horror films today prefer to use the art of making people jump with things suddenly appearing out of nowhere. While some directors know how to pull this off, many give away the surprise jump with camera work and audio tricks to warn you when something is coming. Guillermo del Toro's films though throw in some of these scenes, but instead focuses on another scare factor that affects me a little more: creepiness. Yes my friends Mama is creepy indeed using a combination of many things to create a world that has a good chance of giving you goose bumps. One factor that was a major contributor to the scare factor was the use of shadows. From the very start of the movie the houses are covered in shadows hiding the mysteries from within. In some cases, the camera is pitch black with only the haunting sounds and shifting shades to give insight into what lurks within. Yet many scenes involve using various sources of lights to provide a false sense of security that leaves you wondering if something will happen, which sometimes happens and sometimes doesn't. This unpredictable behavior kept the tension high for me and kept me wondering just where the movie was going. Of course these techniques would be nothing if it weren't for the human imagination. What I mean is that hiding Mama's true form for most of the movie allowed my mind to paint a picture of the specter that lurked within the halls and walls. Oh sure a few glimpses of her here and there provided some input, but there was still enough mystery left to allow me to envision some horrible nightmarish creatures. <br/><br/>Of course once Mama's form was revealed it didn't agree with my imagination, but surprisingly still was quite a sight to see. The dislocated joints, malnourished limbs, and disproportional faces were painted with a sickly brown color that gave it an added touch of realism to send tingles down your spine. Unfortunately some of the scenes relied too much on the CGI to bring her to life and her exaggerated movements blurred into mediocre CGI effects. What they lacked in the looks department though was made up for in the way Mama moved. At first nothing more than distant floats and occasional bursting out of the wall, Mama's behavior quickly evolved into something I hadn't seen in a while. The damage to her body gave it incredible flexibility that allowed her to contort into numerous positions that had the audience screaming in horror despite how fake it looked. For me though the scariest movement was her rapid dislocated walk she performed as she reached out to grab the little girl at the same time. <br/><br/>A few additional creep factors had to be the little girl Lilly and the background music. Lilly is the creepier of the two sisters as her silent demeanor and large eyes are a combination that will affect most. Most of the movie involves her stalking around the house, watching from the shadows silently like a creature on the prowl. When someone confronts her she says little as her large eyes seem to peer into your soul to shake your core. As for the music factor, well it's nothing spectacular, but it fits well with the scenes of the movie. The piano in particular provides a spectrum of sounds to match the emotions sometimes implying doom, while other times giving an extra sound that somehow provides the desired effect. <br/><br/>Besides creepiness though, this movie doesn't have many unique strengths that boost is score. The acting is fine, with Chastain once again doing a nice job with her part, but other than sounding and staring creepily at the camera there wasn't much to comment on. Many of the characters were fine and had a little more development than I expected in a horror movie, yet their development was very linear and predictable despite the emotion they portrayed. As for the story, it still falls into one of the tried and true plots that have been overused in Hollywood. However, the way the story was developed was entertaining and well done in my opinion. Instead of Chastain and the gang making random discoveries, the history of Mama was uncovered through a series of dreams, research, and hypnotic interviews with one of the girls. While it certainly isn't the best, I did enjoy the nice change in the delivery. <br/><br/>Mama is a horror movie that does its job right. Keeping it PG- 13 was indeed the right decision as it allowed the crew to make a movie that could mess with your head instead of drenching the screen in gore. Wondering if it is worth seeing in theaters? I'll say it is, but more for the horrifying screams and sounds, instead of actually story. I also wish people precautions as this movie may have some flashing light moments that may cause seizures if not careful. My scores for Mama are the following: Horror: 7.5 Movie Overall: 6.5-7.0"
"jrobthornton","8","21","38","18 January 2013"," Very few horror movies have done this with character development.
","I was extremely surprised with this movie. The character development was sensational. Jessica Chastain was really good. She went from an irresponsible, un-child wanting rocker. To a loving mother. The daughters went from psycho, savage human beings. But eventually they find happiness. Especially at the end, Lilly gets what she has always wanted, to be with ""mama"". Victoria gets a true mother and father. I haven't seen much character development in a horror movie at all. The most before this was Sydney from the ""Scream"" franchise, and that was rather minor. The way that this all comes together in the end is incredible. Even ""mama"" has a beautiful (yet disturbing) revelation. An intense movie like this needed some sort of relief and it has a few funny little bits. The script was written well and the story was really unique. The scares were frequent and they kept me on the edge of my seat. I can some it up by saying, I highly recommend this movie due to the great story, script, scares, and character development."
"caseymoviemania","2","26","49","27 January 2013"," Casey's Movie Mania: MAMA (2013)
","Last year, when Guillermo del Toro helped executive produced Troy Nixey's directing debut in a supernatural chiller called DON'T BE AFRAID OF THE DARK, many horror fans were expecting an edge-of-the-seat spookfest but what they got, was a horror-movie yawner instead. This year, it's sad to say that del Toro failed to live up to his good reputation for the second time in another supernatural chiller called MAMA. Expanded by sibling filmmakers Andres and Barbara Muschietti from their 2008 short, Andres Muschietti's directing debut does bears the influence of executive producer Guillermo del Toro's trademark of graphic supernatural elements and moody visuals. Unfortunately, MAMA is a crushing bore that doesn't do much other than repeating the same scare over the course of 109-minute running time.<br/><br/>Like DON'T BE AFRAID OF THE DARK, the movie begins with a promising setup: a depressed father named Jeffrey (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) shot two business associates and his ex-wife, before kidnapping his two little daughters: Victoria (Morgan McGarry) and Lilly (Maya and Sierra Dawe), and flees with them to an unknown destination. During the getaway, he was driving too fast on a snowy highway and eventually losing control of his car. The car crashes, but all of them survives. Soon after, he takes the kids through the woods until they come to an old cabin in the middle of nowhere. Once inside, he takes out his gun to prepare a double murder-suicide. But before he is able to pull the trigger, something sinister appears from the dark and snatches him away. The two little girls are then left by themselves with only the mysterious creature as their companion.<br/><br/>So far, so good. But what follows next is an awfully familiar story that fails to find its proper footing ever since. Five years later, the girls, Victoria (Megan Charpentier) and Lilly (Isabelle Nelisse), are now grown up to 8 and 6-year-old respectively. Both of them are gradually discovered living on their own in the cabin, and later brought to an institute where they are studied and held under intensive care by a psychiatrist named Dr. Dreyfuss (Daniel Kash). After years living remotely all by themselves, the girls are feral, frightened and limited in their language abilities. Throughout their state of isolation, they are so psychologically disturbed that they are thought to have created an imaginary female protector named ""Mama"".<br/><br/>Then one day the girls are released into the custody of their uncle, Lucas (also Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) and his goth-rocker girlfriend, Annabel (Jessica Chastain). However, Annabel isn't a motherly type and doesn't seems to be comfortable having two children living in their house. But that's not the only problem -- apparently the girls have somehow brought along their ""Mama"" with them. Things get worse when Lucas is hospitalized following a mysterious fall down the stairs, and forced Annabel to be left alone with the girls. Slowly, Annabel discovers something is very wrong that the so-called ""Mama"" isn't an imaginary person after all.<br/><br/>Everything in MAMA is painfully clichéd: the story is pedestrian and most of the scares are more of the same. The pace is also slow-moving, with nothing much happens and the revelatory finale is a huge disappointment -- especially when the director finally shows the full-bodied creature of ""Mama"". Needless to say, the creature looks too fake with its spotty special effects.<br/><br/>Somewhere in between, there are worthwhile camera placements by Andres Muschietti but his overall direction is a routine exercise in style but little substance. The cast does what they can with their given roles, particularly from Jessica Chastain's credible performance as Annabel.<br/><br/>The rest is a yawner."

Don't watch this movie, you see the the main evil person in the first 5 minuets, now come on thats no way to build suspense.

"KineticSeoul","6","22","43","31 January 2013"," Besides the structure, design and vibe everything else is mediocre
","I liked the structure, design and vibe of this movie but everything else was kinda mediocre. It's basically a ghost haunting movie, of course the ghosts in different movies haunts for different reasons. But this one is a ghost haunting movie. Where two sibling kids that move like a spider Gollum especially the younger one that gets found in a small house in the woods. And a couple decides to take care of them because the guy feels responsible because they are the daughters of his brother who disappeared. And the 30yr old garage band girl who is the girlfriend of the guy because she feels that she needs to put up with it. This movie does a decent job of making a dis-likable character somewhat likable near the end. Like I said the structure, design and vibe adds a lot to the creepiness but when it comes to the story, it doesn't really stand out. This movie is much better than ""Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark"" which is another movie presented by Guillermo del Toro. But it doesn't reach the psychedelic dreamlike vibe that is creepy or even scary and yet beautiful although it tries to be. The film ""The Orphanage"" comes to mind. <br/><br/>6/10"

","Like the title says, i enjoyed this movie immensely, the usual horror clichés are there but i still feel the movie felt fresh, and did things slightly differently from the norm. Mama herself is an excellent creation,they keep her image out of it until later for maximum tension, and then when she is unleashed its like all the dread thats been building explodes into fear. her movement etc is exactly what is needed to make this sort of film scary. There are a couple of moments that are pure terror and i was laughing after a few of the bits just because i was so amused and entertained by the scariness. My girlfriend actually moaned with fear at one point! Her face throughout the 2nd half was priceless :P i think some of the other reviewers are being overly critical, yes the end wasn't amazing but it think it did a much better job than a lot of other films like this, and seeing this gives me hope that there's still very scary things that can be done in this genre of horror. :)<br/><br/>Its maybe not a 10, more an 8.5/9 but im giving it a ten to balance out the negative reviews."

The special effects were great and didn't need the CGI to carry the story. The young actresses that played Victoria and Lily give an excellent performance. I'm not giving away the ending but I will say we talked about the significance of it long after we left the theater. Some folks on here were worried that the PG-13 rating would weaken the movie. It didn't. This film was scary without the blood or gore.<br/><br/>This was a great movie for anyone over 13. Please leave the kids at home. Some idiot brought two kids under 10 to the screening. I'm sure those kids will have nightmares for weeks.<br/><br/>I give Mama a 7 out of 10"
"mustardman29","4","12","23","27 January 2013"," Most reviewers must have only saw the first half of what I saw
","I had high hopes after reading some very positive reviews and after the impressive performance Chastain gave in Zero Dark Thirty. For the first half of the movie those expectations seemed to be largely met. Some good old school horror thrills as others have said. Things got more and more ridiculous as the movie progressed and had to reveal more of what was going on to keep the suspense going. It was still not too bad until the ending which all I can say (without giving anything away) was completely ridiculous. The first sign of trouble for me was when a character jumps into their SUV and drives into the middle of nowhere to a creepy old cabin by themselves, timed to arrive at night, with nothing but a flashlight. That's just the first hint of how dumb things get.<br/><br/>Yea, it's about ghosts so you have to kind of leave your logic and reason at the door but the ending was bad enough that it transcends that. I'm not even getting into the ridiculous fact there are all these strange things and sounds going on in the house day after day with a couple creepy kids acting even more creepy when it happens and the parental characters don't even bother to look into it. Not even so much as opening closets after seeing something go in there.<br/><br/>The only reason to watch this movie is for Chastain who made the most of a ridiculous script."
"gardoma","6","18","38","16 January 2013"," Good but not Great
","""Mama"" comes with a fantastic pedigree. It is produced by Guillermo del Toro, and directed by Andy Muschietti, who has adapted its own wonderful short movie ""Mama"" (2008; you can find it on Youtube). The trailer was also exceedingly good, so my expectations were reasonably high---but they were disappointed.<br/><br/>""Mama"" tells the story of two little girls who are abandoned in the woods after losing both parents in tragic circumstances. They are found after 5 years in horrible conditions: feral and dirty, they crawl on four legs and move like an animal. Everybody assumes that the girls have survived on their own in the woods. Unfortunately, that is not quite the case. And, when their uncle and auntie take them in with them (helped by a shady psychiatrist), the frightening truth comes out. <br/><br/>""Mama"" has a few stunning visuals and delivers the promised amount of scares. It does juggle well the balance between suspense and sudden jumps, and it is a quite enjoyable horror movie, several steps above the average horror flick. The disjointed figure that moves at unnatural speed (which made the short movie famous in the first place) is eerie, scary, fresh, and beautiful at the same time. The trick of speeding-up movements to create a sense of supernatural pace is used for the girls too (when they crawl on all fours at impossible speeds), and it works perfectly.<br/><br/>However, ""Mama"" never quite overcomes its origins---that is, a short movie that has been stretched out to full-feature length. In this stretching-out process, some additions were made that work perfectly (the story arch of the girls left alone in the woods, and found in a feral state), and some were made that simply don't work at all (the titular character's background story is cheesy, the psychiatrist is introduced simply as an excuse to explain parts of the plot, then quickly dismissed). Like many horrors, Mama works when each scene is taken in isolation, but does not work as a whole because the screenplay does not quite organize the brilliant seminal idea in a proper way. Some dialog is just too bad; some characters undeveloped; some plot twists forced; some background explanations unnecessary and prosaic. <br/><br/>Somehow, the problems of structuring the original ideas into a full-length storyline ends up compromising the movie's visuals, which are its strongest point. The special effects for the main character work beautifully as long as it makes only brief appearances. But the extended storyline requires it to be seen on screen for longer periods of time towards the end, and, as the titular creature is seen more and more, it loses its realism and begins to look like cheap CGI, glossy, fake, translucent and not quite believable enough to be genuinely scary. This is a mistake that, for instance, last year's superior ""The Woman in Black"" cleverly avoided making.<br/><br/>In summary, the movie is an above-average horror that could have been a great horror, but fell short of accomplishing its potential."

Upon seeing the film on the shelf I turned to IMDb, as I usually do to see what the ratings are, most modern horrors tend to score relatively low but this seemed to have a respectable score which I think is ill-considered.

","there is something good living next to the German border. they get movies in their cinemas, many months (even up to 1 year) before they come in the danish cinemas. this time me and my friends went to see mama. having heard many positive things about it we were excited. how did it go? the first thing i noticed, was how beautiful this movie was shot, and all the atmosphere surrounding it. the story was also pretty good, and original for 3/4 of the movie. the last 1/4 took a trip downhill, especially because of the monster. yeah the monster, what can i say about that. the first 2/3 of the movie, they really build up to the reveal of the monster, and i personally thought the drawings were pretty effective. the build up, did by the way scare some of my friends, so good was it. but when they showed us the monster, we laughed. it just looked so stupid! and of course it had its similarities to the grudge monster (how original). but what really ruined it, was the use of the monster in the ending. if you were ever frightened by it, you weren't any more at the end. so all in all, its a beautiful movie, with some great mystique in the beginning. and despite the disappointing ending, i will still recommend it, especially to watch with friends, but wait for the DVD release, its not worth paying a ticket for each person."
"jeffrey-utley","6","8","15","15 July 2013"," A Haunted House Movie, But With Something I've Never Seen Before
","This is a movie by Andrés Muschietti. You've never heard of him because this is his first major motion picture. Yep, basically a first time director. 'Mama' was the most anticipated horror movie from November of 2012 to when it came out, and ""The Best Horror Movie of the Year"" until April 2013, form a first time director. So, I saw it on opening weekend, and I thought... How could a first time director make such a good horror movie.<br/><br/>There were many scares in this movie that were in the trailers. That's why it was so anticipated... But it was still really good. The beginning was... Odd, but interesting. They also did a good job at having you see the ghost that was in a very good context. It started out with a lot of potential and made a clear path for itself. After the title sequence it got slow, like basically all horror movies do; but it was interesting. There was some creepy with the girls, but it was in a bit of an unexplained context. It's hard to explain. There was good acting, good dialog, and character buildup that worked. Some very creepy and unnerving things happened in coming up scenes that worked well for this movie. Muschietti was doing a really good job at throwing the scares at us.<br/><br/>Coming up, there were many, many creepy moments, especially with the little girls. Some unfortunate things happen to the family, but it happens for a good reason. That also worked in the movie. Coming up there were even more creepy and even scary things that happened. It did turn into a haunted house movie, but several things happened outside of the house, and this wan't done like most haunted house movies. I liked seeing something different in this type of movie. It worked about as well as the cliché haunted house movie horror events and scares, but still, it was new. There were creepy, suspenseful, intense moments that made most of the creepy parts scary. It was good that this movie was able to pull those scares off. There were some jump scares in this part, but it was less about the point that something was jumping out at you. Some of them were the point that little girls don't do that or the point that those things aren't supposed to to happen. The ones that were just jump scares were so big and done so well that it was actually scary, not just a jump scare. I've rarely seen a movie pull that off.<br/><br/>Coming up, the movie gets extremely intense, suspenseful, creepy, and more scary. Odd things happened, big things to the story line happened, and scary things happened. The scares in past parts of the movie had to do with the sounds or the facts that things like that were not supposed to happen or intense, creepy parts. The scares now almost mainly focused on the visuals. There were very scary things that popped on the screen and were done almost perfectly. There were also realistic reactions and very well done written and directed scenes. There were some things that I had never seen before, but some that I had seen before.<br/><br/>I rate everything up to the end 9/10, but the end brought it down to 7/10, because the ending was horrible. Several things that had been scary in recent parts or earlier in the movie in general, stopped being scary, and were just there. It wasn't scary: it was slow, stupid, badly written, and didn't belong with a horror movie. I don't know why the writers decided to do that, and that Andrés Muschietti decided to execute it that way. It also started to make scary things earlier in the movie not seem as scary when you look back on them.<br/><br/>'Mama' was good, scary, and done well. It could have been an 8/10 or 9/10 if the ending was good, but it was not. It did not bother me later at all, but it was still scary. I recommend this movie to anyone who's thinking about seeing it. I bought this movie on Blu-Ray, too. The 7/10 rating means I thought the movie was good."

It had the fingerprint of a Guillermo Del Toro masterpiece like The Devil's Backbone, even though he only produced it.<br/><br/>It retained its strength through the whole first half, with kid actors that weren't annoying and Jessica Chastain putting in a pretty awesome performance as a conflicted caregiver being forced to grow up.<br/><br/>Aaaaand then... cgi.<br/><br/>And not even subtle cgi either... like, freaking ""nothing was real on the whole screen"" cgi. By the end I felt like I was watching a damn cartoon. Does this seriously not bother younger audiences today? I don't get it, here we had a potentially terrifying, potentially poignant film completely destroyed by cgi yet it gets decent reviews.<br/><br/>So yeah, if you don't mind abysmal (and we're talking, SyFy channel level abysmal) cgi plastered all over your final act, then you might enjoy Mama. As it stands, I give it 7 stars for the first half and deduct 3 of them for the second half. 4/10."

Poor Jessica Chastain is completely unconvincing as a punk-rock chick turned stepmother to two feral girls who were raised by an irate ghost in the woods.

","If you see this movie you are either desperate to get out of the house, or you're a fool. (if I had known what I do now, I would never have gone)<br/><br/>Let me be frank: so many movies are just desperate attempts to catch the public's attention, and if they can accomplish that, actually having a decent movie is completely secondary. Independence Day suckered in tens of millions of people with a flashy trailer. Of course, the trailer was the best part of the movie.<br/><br/>What's wrong with ""Mama""? It's such a tired re-tread of so many other movies, and one that just doesn't ring true as an ""authentic"" story, one you could actually believe. It's so much like ""The Grudge"" or ""The Eye"". The (over)-use of moths to represent evil was done just last year in the abominable movie, ""The Possession"" (to the disgrace of Sam Raime).<br/><br/>Another problem: we know very quickly what is happening so there is little real suspense, except for who will live and who will die. But since we can't buy into the story anyway, it doesn't matter very much.<br/><br/>Too many movies act like if they add enough feathers, they can turn a sickly duck into a swan. In ""Mama"" the only way to keep our interest is to use CGI... to death. Let's be honest: we know that CGI is CGI. It's not novel. It's not clever. It's desperation. It's fine when you want to show an army of 10,000. Then it can actually work well. But not in something like this where we know we are seeing lame computer animation. Enough already! Stop insulting the viewer's intelligence and sophistication. If this were 1960 you could get away with it. Not now.<br/><br/>The central problems are redundancy and imitation. We know ""mama"" is this bad, evil spirit. We know she will strike. But since ""mama"" is a ridiculous CGI projection, we yawn. Imitation is the biggest culprit here. How many movies have we seen where a wrong was committed in the past and now the only way for the spirit to rest is for that wrong to be righted? <br/><br/>This movie fails on so many levels. It's just so derivative or dozens of other movies that there is no point in watching.<br/><br/>I gave this 2 stars. Looking back, I gave ""The Possession"" 3. Probably should switch those ratings. Of the two, ""The Possession"" was even lamer."

But this is one of those pictures where the previews are far far scarier than the actual movie. Nothing in the film makes to much sense. There seems to be no logical reason for anything to be happening. It turns out to be a very simple 'ghost' story. The middle part and the ending of the film is what let the whole production down. For about an hour nothing much happens to advance the story...it is an hour of ""whoops...I see the 'ghost'...whoops it went away"" This central hour of the film goes on too long like that. The end, however, was just....god awful. It was painfully obvious that whoever wrote this movie had no freaking idea how to end it. The result of this?

With a pg-13 rating, you can expect a lot of intense pop-out scenes. However, Guillermo del Toro doesn't disappoint the audience as he gives us something to look at too. That's because Mama is today's modern CGI ghost that isn't bashful to show her retched face to the characters in the film (and us).<br/><br/>The brief storyline is that two girls have survived out in the wild after their father murders his wife, takes the girls and crashes his car off a cliff in the middle of nowhere. After being found by the father's brother, the girls are re-acclimated to society after 5 years in the woods raised by, you guessed it, Mama.<br/><br/>There is a back story to mama that gets woven into the mix, which is the reason why good horror films are successful. However, the more interesting aspect of the movie for me was the brief transition from ""Wild"" to ""Normal"" life. There could have been more to this I think.<br/><br/>I would love to see the little sister, Lilly (Isabelle Nélisse), get an Oscar for her performance. Seriously!! It's downright eerie and just isn't something you would expect to see from a 6 year old. And she nailed it.<br/><br/>All in all, if you like to be scared, this will do it.

","Mama (2013): Dir: Andres Muschietti / Cast: Jessica Chastain, Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, Megan Charpentier, Isabelle Nelisse, Daniel Kash: This is a disgrace to horror films. Listening to two young girls go about whispering ""mama"" over and over is enough to make someone flop their head against a wall. It involves two girls who are discovered in a cabin after five years. Their father proved a moron on icy roads and crashed over an embankment then he takes the two girls to this cabin where he attempts to kill them and is vanquished by a smokey wicked witch of the west. They are found and sent to live with their uncle and his rock chick girlfriend. She is played by the talented Jessica Chastain in what is low grade material compared to her acclaim work in Zero Dark Thirty. It is established early that she doesn't want children so the screenplay knocks off the boyfriend when he sees black moths emerging from a wall. So it forces her into that clichéd pathetic ""I suddenly like children"" bullshit. Other than the special effects there is nothing to recommend here. We have a witch who can move about like a bad wig on the floor. Director Andres Muschietti seems to be unintentionally making a comedy. Chastain looks lovely in her rocker clothes but this is beneath her, and the wig is no help either. Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau spends most of the film in a hospital bed. We have idiots roaming about the woods at night, which is real swift. The youngest girl chows down everything from moths to hair like a human shock vac. With the most laughable witch ever conceived, this film becomes about as frightening as a Kool Aid commercial. Score: 1 / 10"

","In the opening scene we see a car parked outside a house.The door is open and the car radio can be heard, which informs us that like the last financial crisis this time too (2008) there has been extreme consequences.An analyst working for an investment bank has gone berserk and shot two of his colleagues .He is missing and the police are looking for him.Its a horror film already.<br/><br/>But Mama is not the kind of horror film that describes the man made devastation that we wreck upon ourselves.This is a more conventional horror flick full of jumpy moments when you are likely to get startled out of your wits and embarrass yourself in front of your neighbor in the next seat who seems to watching a different film, a comedy perhaps.So a good horror film involves being anxious or jumpy or both, but keeping your body under control.It really helps if you have somebody to lean onto.<br/><br/>We enter the house and see the crazed executive Lucas (Nikolaj Koster-Waldau) drive off with his two little girls on an icy mountain road.He has just killed his wife.He is going too fast and even his daughter thinks so.The car skids off the frozen road and they scramble out into the ominous woods.They find an abandoned cottage soon enough, as it always happens, and we know for sure that going in is a stupid idea.But this man has just killed 3 people, he is beyond reason.He is about to kill his daughters and himself when a supernatural being swoops down on him and pulls him away, into hell perhaps.His daughters are left alone in the icy cottage.That they will survive becomes clear and the title credits show us crayon drawings depicting them morphing into subhuman beings and go back to walking on all fours.<br/><br/>Jump cut 5 years and Lucases brother Jeffrey, also played by Koster-Waldau, is still on the lookout for his nieces. He is living with his girlfriend Annabel played by Jessica Chastain who is part of a band.One day his hired investigators stumble upon the car and the cottage.They find the girls, they have survived but are completely damaged goods.They end up in the temporary care of a Dr. Dreyfuss who finds the prospect of studying the girls a goldmine of professional opportunity, to be exploited beyond the realm of good sense.The sight of the two little wild girls is one the most terrifying part of the film, we expect them to turn out to be ultra-violent, unpredictable and worse, evil.Instead they turn out to be just innocent children who have been through an unspeakable ordeal. The girls are put into the care of Jeffrey and Annabel who try their best to bring them back into a ""normal"" way of life.Of course evil forces are at work.They were in the care of ""mama"" in the woods who visits them in their new home, steering clear of the adults.Hereafter the film spirals into a familiar territory of scary jumpy moments, of close brushes with evil, set to nerve- wracking music.<br/><br/>Horror is a genre not for the faint hearted, for the directors that is.The task of scaring a new age audience fed an almost daily diet of gore and thrills supplied by TV shows, theme park rides, video games and novelty horror fare like the three installments of Paranormal Activity and counting, is indeed fraught with its own faux horror.<br/><br/>Andy Muschetti directs with a quiet assured touch and delivers a fair share of genuine jumpy moments.He uses a completely desaturated colour palette which feels unreal and but does help the film achieve a chilly atmosphere.Mama of course comes tagged with the name of Guillermo del Toro (director of the cult classic Pans Labyrinth) as the executive producer, which must be an assurance of much above-average fare, given his well-earned reputation as a highly inventive and original filmmaker. Muschetti delivers some very stylized flashbacks which provide a back story to the evil in the film.The use of Azetic Black Witch Moths, the same species which had a starring role in The Silence of the Lambs, to underscore the eeriness and offer a link between us and the supernatural, adds a mythic dimension to the film. The ethereal and statuesque Jessica Chastain is the star of this film and indeed the star of the year.She is nominated for Oscar this year for Zero Dark Thirty following her nomination last year for Terrence Malik's Tree of Life.That great film launched Chastain, who has since played an amazing range of roles with astonishing felicity.In Mama she supplies a very credible version of a well-meaning girlfriend who takes great risk in doing the right thing when it comes to the future of two small children.<br/><br/>Horror films must either overwhelm us with the scares or supply us with an emotional link to the characters which makes us scared for them and not just ourselves.Mama tried to do both and succeeds partly on both counts.At the heart of the film is the strongest and sometimes the most damning relationship known to us, that of a mother and child.This is the one bond that drives people to unimaginable limits and suggests an almost otherworldly pull. A great many horror films play on the maternal instincts inside all of us, this one spins it into a very enjoyable thrill ride.<br/><br/>From my film review blog mostlycinema.com"
"TheEtherWalk","3","10","25","29 January 2013"," You've seen it all before... a completely forgettable experience
","I'm absolutely astounded by the amount of praise this film is getting from critics and audiences. Is this how far we've sunk as filmgoers that we accept whatever so-called horror is thrown our way even if it's a big pile of doo-doo? Mama is yet another jump-scare, cgi ridden, laughable cheese-fest just like so many other myriad ""horror"" pictures that have come out in recent years. It's not even cheesy in a good way. There's good cheesy horror comedies out there that are done right, such as Sam Raimi's Drag Me To Hell. It knew that horror and comedy go perfectly together and worked as a result. Mama is cheesy in that it tries way too hard to be scary and it comes off as silly and amateurish, more of an unintentional comedy. Everyone in my theatre was laughing their heads off constantly. I don't think that was the intention.<br/><br/>Granted this film isn't a complete disaster like Boogeyman or Darkness Falls but feels very reminiscent of both those films. Besides the awful CGI ghost, one of the biggest problems with Mama is the overuse of loud noises. Every time something is supposed to be scary, there's an extremely loud noise and usually something flies at the camera really quickly. But it failed to even raise a single hair on my arms or make me scared even for a second. The acting is passable and Jessica Chastain is hot but the plot is nosensical, predictable and has a twist at the end just for the sake of having one in an attempt to save this movie from being completely forgettable. Please folks, don't waste your hard-earned money on sub-par horror movies like this.<br/><br/>If you want a ghost story that is actually well-made and scary, watch the Spanish film The Orphanage. Or wait for the Evil Dead remake in a few months. Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell know that great horror isn't about cheap jump scares and by-the-numbers creepiness. Real horror has to get under your skin. It has to get into your head and make you question your own sanity. It has to spark some synapses in your brain and affect you on a subconscious level to truly be scary. See Mulholland Drive by David Lynch for a perfect example. Unfortunately, Mama did none of these things for me and just feels like yet another bargain bin 'horror' title. It's also overlong at 100 minutes and padded with repetitive scenes that add nothing to the film. This is Andrés Muschietti's debut as a feature film director and it shows. He fails to create anything original or worthwhile, simply borrowing from dozens of other horror flicks. 61% on Rotten Tomatoes? 6.6 on the IMDb? For shame."
"tylerharrell7","3","8","19","18 January 2013"," Mama (small spoilers)
","Jessica Chastain better hope that Academy members have already cast their votes or will opt to see ""The Last Stand"" this weekend. Why? Because her latest role in the supernatural horror film ""Mama"" could possibly kill her Oscar chances.<br/><br/>Marching under the production banner of Guillermo del Toro, ""Mama"" fails to channel the producer-director's fantastic contributions to the horror genre. Instead, it tarnishes his ballooning reputation and respectable track record. Lately, del Toro has produced horror films by first-time directors; this time it's Andres Muschietti. Adapted from the short ""Mama,"" which Muschiette also wrote and directed, the freshman director seems so focused on emulating del Toro's creepy atmospherics and visual flair that he ends up sacrificing the storytelling, as well as the very reason we're paying to see this film in the first place. Where are the scares? ""Mama"" begins with a troubled father Jeffrey (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, aka Jamie f'ing Lannister from ""Game of Thrones"") suffering a meltdown and murdering his co-workers and wife. Jeffrey takes his two young daughters Victoria (Megan Charpentier) and Lilly (Isabelle Nelisse) on the lam, using a cabin deep in the woods (though it honestly felt like a few hundred yards from the road) as a hideout. Within minutes, the father falls victim to the cabin's supernatural occupant (the titular Mama), leaving the kids to be fed and raised by her.<br/><br/>Cut to five years later, when the girls -- who have become feral -- are found by a search party and brought back to civilization. They are adopted after by their father's twin Lucas (Coster-Waldau once again) and his reluctant Joan Jett-wannabe girlfriend, Annabel (Chastain). Despite their obvious psychological damage, the courts deem it okay for these Gollum-esque girls to move into a home with their new guardians. It's at this point that the setup starts to feel completely mismanaged. Wouldn't there be a worldwide media event if two young girls survived on their own? You know Oprah would be all over this s---! The malevolent Mama moves in as well, continuing to spend time with the children, who miss her too, especially Lilly. In time, the children's' affections and loyalties begin to transfer to Lucas and Annabel. Mama becomes resentful and lashes out, harming everyone who threatens her relationship with the girls. Soon, the only person left to protect the children is the tatted-up, Misfits tee-clad girlfriend, Annabel.<br/><br/>By introducing her via a negative home pregnancy test celebration, followed by a brief exploration of her career as a beer-swilling bassist in a punk rock brand, audiences are immediately made to see Annabel as a nihilist toward the responsibility of being a parent. As the film progresses, it's totally transparent that her attachment toward the girls will grow and her newly found maternal instincts will keep her from running out the door. Though, I wish she had taken the latter option -- not only does the gifted actress look bored, but Chastain's character itself is offensively stereotypical.<br/><br/>Borrowing elements from numerous horror movies, including ""The Woman in Black"" and ""The Grudge,"" ""Mama"" doesn't have a single moment where something feels fresh and/or original. The majority of the scare tactics, which are too few and far between, are cheaply deployed. Classic clichÃ©s of ""don't go in the closet"" or ""don't look under the bed"" are repeated to the point of exhaustion. And the titular ghost at hand is bogged down by the ridiculous looking CGI, and at times, resembles a resurrected Olive Oyl from ""Popeye."" Chastain can be forgiven for this misstep into the horror genre because we have seen it before with other successful actresses, notably Halle Berry in ""Gothika"" and Hilary Swank in ""The Reaping."" But would it have killed her to wait until she had an Oscar before proceeding right into the paycheck films? Now, if you will excuse meÂ…I have to watch ""Zero Dark Thirty"" again, if only to clear my head and throw ""Mama"" from the brain."
"fahadkashmiri7","5","3","5","17 February 2013"," Guillermo del Toro... is just an executive producer in this film. Nothing more than that.
","There's a new gimmick in Hollywood these days. Recruit a famous writer/director of the past and gave them any crappy post in the movie and then publicized the movie using their name. Same goes with Mama. Guillermo del Toro's name has been used to promote the film heavily. But the matter of fact is that he's just an executive producer in the film. Nor he's the writer nor the director of this mindless CGI based crap. As far as the movie goes, its a disappointment overall. I had expected something lot creepier and mindful cinema but what i got was a total CGI based flick based on the premises of The Exorcist and god knows how many movies. See, frankly speaking those days are gone when a CGI created ghost in long gowns and disoriented faces used to scare the s**t out of audiences. Now as an audience people want more mindful and intellectual cinema, be it any genre. Mama's premises was very solid but it was ruined by some really loose script. And lastly, who in the blue is Jessica Chastain???? Is she some Meryll Streep or Julia Roberts? No disregard to her acting but the way the film is promoted as a Jessica Chastain movie is ridiculous. Grow up Hollywood. Audiences had already."

"toddg-473-289818","4","4","8","10 December 2013"," Another promising concept falls apart
","I was hoping there would be a way to write this review without adding any spoilers, but the ending of this movie is so awful that it is unavoidable. ""Mama"" is the story of two young girls who are abandoned in the forest for five years, and are discovered then brought back to civilization with the hope of rehabilitating and reintroducing them to a normal life. What is largely unseen for most of the movie is what the children describe as ""Mama"", a ghostly creature that had watched over them during their abandonment, and who is now jealous of their new found family life. <br/><br/>What works in this movie are the strong performances by the young girls, unsure of their new environment, and trying in their own elementary way to explain to other adults who ""Mama"" is. And for most of the movie, we only get glimpses of ""Mama"", and the less-is-more visualization works for the audience. We learn through the research of the child psychiatrist assigned to the girls that ""Mama"" is really a woman from 1800's who killed herself and her infant after escaping from an insane asylum. We are told that ghosts from the past return and torment those in the present until some wrong is righted. This could have sufficed to end this movie with an acceptable conclusion - but this movie went too far, including the unnecessary death of one of the young girls at the end. <br/><br/>We see the wrong righted with the return of the skeleton of Mama's infant baby returned to Mama, reminiscent of the way that Johnny Depp tossed the head of the Headless Horseman to Christopher Walken in ""Sleepy Hollow"", leaving no further need for violence. But for reasons not easily explained, Mama felt the need to take one of the living children with her after she had gotten what she came for. Furthermore, when Mama is made visible to the adults and children at the end of the movie, she looked more cartoonish than scary, and became a caricature of the terrifying ghost represented earlier. A very disappointing ending to a film that showed promise."
"Mariahdemery","5","4","8","9 August 2013"," What really happened to Lily
","OK so I know like a lot others I was confused when it came to what actually was going on in the movie. I know for one when mama took lily I was like ""This is some BS"". My dad, who unlike me was not covering eyes every time something popped out, explained it to me. If you actually watch the title sequence at the beginning of the movie you will see that lily was attacked by raccoons. She then got sick and actually died and in the drawings on the wall all this is shown. Of course I didn't think he was right till all the examples were pointed out. She was always super freakishly fast and never seemed to do normal things. She was eating the dead moths, jumping from second story windows unharmed, she was confused when the girlfriend blew warm air on her body because her being dead her body was cold, she never seemed to heal up and always had some form of scratches or bruises on her body, and she stayed outside in the cold all night. It's sad but true. If you go back and watch in one scene the doctor shows a clip of the girls asleep. Victoria is asleep in the bed but Lily is in the corner with her knees to her chest and her head turned at an unnatural angle and white glowing eyes. It all makes since. So all in all mama taking her at the end was I guess justified because she knew she didn't belong with them. Lily was almost only there to make sure Victoria was safe before moving on. One question I still have though is why Mama slung her own baby's remains off the cliff like some garbage. It all worked out in the end I guess."

","It started out good, and had lot of promise, but failed to deliver. This movie had a ton of potential, but never got there. It just wasn't scary. It never drew me in. It feels like all the parts for a good movie were there, but they just weren't put together right. 10 lines of text fine. The ghost appears to early. It lacked suspense. The characters were predictable. The girls crawling around was great, but it wasn't scary. Visually the movie was done really well, but it just din't work. I have seen way worse movies, but I have also seen way better. If you have absolutely nothing better to do go ahead and watch this, buy looking out your window might be more entertaining.

The acting was all good, especially the kids, there were not that much stupid horror movie decisions, but all of that fell in the water when the ending came. That animation was so bad it made me laugh, the whole 10 min. scene was so bad it destroyed everything the movie built... 5/10"
"nitzanhavoc","7","2","3","15 January 2015"," Original story, fine acting, some frightening scenes... Then the ending spoiled it for me
","As a devout horror fan for over a decade now, there are very few sub-genres I haven't encountered during my ever ongoing search for the thrill of fear. Still, Mama has managed to take me by surprise. This film, in my opinion, is simply too... well, different. So in this review I face the challenging task of being objective even though I did not really enjoy it.<br/><br/>I have my issues with the plot, though I find it to be quite original and innovative, a trait modern Horror sadly lacks in most films. A husband and father has a breakdown due to a financial crisis, kills his wife and takes his daughters to a deserted remote cabin, with the intention of killing them too. However, something stops him. Something protects the girls and cares for them, helping them survive in the wild for 5 years. So far - so good, and quite impressive! <br/><br/>Cinematography features a little too many jump scares, which I personally enjoy, but recognize for being a cheap stunt. A true Horror prodigy scares the audience using the story and characters, not sudden loud music with a frightening antagonist. Still, I especially enjoyed a certain scene where a flash camera is used instead of a flashlight, very much like the Horror game Outlast.<br/><br/>As for the acting, I always find myself impressed with young actors and actresses, and Mama has a few of these. Megan Charpentier as 8 year old Victoria shows some real promising potential, and so does little Morgan McGarry as young 3 year old Victoria, even though she has very little lines and has to mostly relay on facial expressions and body language. Speaking of which - Isabelle Nelisse as little 6 year old Lilly takes the grand prize for acting in this film, playing her role perfectly! In addition, I must also pay my respects to leading actress Jessica Chastain. I had absolutely loved her in Zero Dark Thirty, yet failed to recognize her in this film as Annabelle. Playing such a different role in such a professional and successful manner really shows a lot of hard work combined with some God given talent, always a pleasure!<br/><br/>I also must be fair and admit that the character of Mama (played by Javier Botete, yes, a male actor, how impressive/weird/awesome/messed up is that?) was one of the scarier that I've seen so far. This is one of these rare occasions where Hollywood really gives Asian Horror a run for its money. Not since Ju-On (The Grudge) has a voice/sound caused me that much distress. Surprisingly, I've learnt that credit here is due to Jane Moffat, who plays Aunt Jean, and is also responsible for the voice of Mama. Talk about chills...<br/><br/>So if I have so many compliments to the plot and crew, where is the problem? That would be the ending. Horror films are not supposed to have a happy ending, true, but this ending didn't feel frightening, simply sad. Heartbreaking, to be more accurate. And given that this is the ending, it's also the feeling with which I finished the film. For me, the ending of a Horror film is extremely important in setting the overall experience, and ending a film with sadness and pain rather than fear is a big setback.<br/><br/>So all in all, I must be fair and say that this is film is good, maybe even very good. A good film which I ultimately did not enjoy. I would say, as I do always - watch it yourselves and be your own judges. After a long personal debate, I've decided to go with a 7 rather than my originally planned 6. Mama has earned this much."
"vincentlynch-moonoi","6","2","3","25 July 2014"," Made on the cheap...and it shows
","I love to savor a really good horror movie. This was neither ""very good"" (although it was ""okay""), nor worth savoring; it was ""watchable"".<br/><br/>First off, the actors. I'll give some high points to a supporting actress -- Diane Gordon -- who plays an archivist. At least she was interesting. And, I think Megan Charpentier is probably developing into a rather good child actress. As for the rest -- they do their jobs and nothing more. Jessica Chastain is a promising young actress...usually.<br/><br/>As to the special effects...well, let's put it this way: the film cost a whopping $15 million to make (wish print allowed obvious sarcasm)...and it shows. And to cover up the cheapness they did much of the ""scariest"" part of the film in the dark (yawn). The doctor going out into the deep woods in the middle of the night...that makes no sense. And when he gets in the cottage...which has no electricity...it's not quite dark enough to hide the cheap special effects, so they have his flashlight fail. Oh my. Really pathetic.<br/><br/>As to the story itself, Marlon Brando probably would have said, ""It could been a contenda!"" It doesn't have the true suspense of ""The Conjuring"" or the class of ""The Woman In Black"". That's not to say it doesn't have its moments; it does have some good moments...but the suspense is not sustained. A few times I wanted to laugh when I was supposed to be scared.<br/><br/>Two things are interesting about the film. First, it got decent reviews, but somewhat low numbers here on IMDb. Second after spending just $15 million to make the film, it took in $156 million. Not a bad take for not a great film. I guess there's just a lot of horror lovers out there who will take in whatever comes along."
"Botsu","4","2","3","12 June 2014"," Boring
","So here's the thing about Mama: you can have all the outstanding performances, spot-on camera work and decent special effects you like, when you lack atmosphere, all is lost in the horror genre, and let that be what this film's weakest point is. The tricky bit about genuine fear is the thin line between tension and confronting whatever's lurking in the dark: most horror films nowadays mistake suspense with making whatever it is the movie's throwing at you go ""boo"" in your face. This movie, however, takes the other extreme: nearly nothing happens throughout the whole movie, aside from a few scary bits (first scene with the butterfly!), but the legitimately creepy moments are way too far in between to fully enjoy or even notice on first glance, for that matter. The movie's ending is the weakest of all. I won't spoil: but trust me, after you're done with it you'll wonder when the Disney logo'll appear in the credits. Don't waste your time on this, except if your 12-year old wants to see his first horror move THAT bad or something."

","(Credit IMDb) Annabel and Lucas are faced with the challenge of raising his young nieces that were left alone in the forest for 5 years.... but how alone were they?<br/><br/>For some reason, I was dreading this when it was first announced. The title sounded so stupid to me and it seemed like just another horror movie to make some quick cash and disappoint me, like so many Horror movies do these days. It wasn't anywhere near as bad as I thought. It has some decent boo scares and the potential was there for this to be a standout horror film, but sadly it didn't meet that potential. The ""Mama"" creature is fairly well done and somewhat eerie. The opening is by far the best thing about this film. It involves the wonderfully talented Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau. It is tense, disturbing, and very riveting. After that whole ordeal is through, it never manages to reach those heights again. Jessica Chastain's character created a big problem with me. Her character is virtually unlikable for the first half of the film before she starts coming around. Her abrasiveness was extremely hard for me to warm up to. She did fine with what she was given, but I would have preferred her to be more sympathetic. It's a watchable horror film that has it's moments.

"Snuzzlescuf","4","2","3","21 November 2013"," Love the scares, hate the everything else
","**SPOILERS AHEAD**<br/><br/>People say this is one of the best horror movies of the decade. If you're counting scare factors, absolutely, but if you're talking about a movie that will keep you engaged beginning to end, then hell. No.<br/><br/>First and foremost, I love horror and horror movies and I like a movie that SCARES me. This movie had some legitimate scares that didn't quite make me scream, but caused me to jump and made my heart to skip a couple beats. The few scenes that are predictable are given a little spice to make them unpredictable and I really enjoyed that aspect of it. The scares are the best parts of the movie, by far. Now, if you're looking for a movie with a good story, no. Just no. This went from being about two girls to being about a woman who wanted nothing to do with them, then about a ghost with Down Syndrome being humanized (seriously, she did have Down's). This is the generic story of a ghost who comes back because she wants her child, but takes a damn good turn in the middle and then U-turns back to the worst possible ending.<br/><br/>In the middle, there is a very, very cell-shaded flashback that takes you completely out of the movie. I mean, it's like a 70's blitzkrieg hit the screen. At one point, you get to see one douche (who runs away after releasing the Kraken in this woman's house) get destroyed by a ghost, which is fine, but later when they come to the scene of his death, the guy has disappeared (he also isn't referenced at all for the rest of the movie); something that doesn't happen to another character. There is also a scene where the ghost possesses someone in the famous ""slowly walk up behind someone and turn them around and they have a scary face"" scene. Later (back in the house, in the exact spot where the aforementioned man died), they try to pull off the exact same thing with the exact same character (but this time, she collapses in a heap of flesh). This possession scene is the only one in the movie, and contains no explanation as to why the ghost would choose to suddenly waste time by possessing this woman.<br/><br/>Sounds pretty okay, correct? Decent, give a 6, huh? Heck no. I was seriously laughing out loud the last 10 minutes of the movie. The ending of this movie is so bad. I honestly felt cheated. I spent a whole good part of that movie getting set up, enduring a bad plot, and getting to see some genuine horror, for this Twilight-teen-bullshit ending. To save the time: the ghost becomes human at one point, the main chick suddenly has the will of a titan and wants the kids that she hates, and it ends right before the credits with the happy ""let's all hug at the edge of a cliff while the ghost dies again"".<br/><br/>In summation: It's good to focus on scares over plot. I get that. But if you can't figure out a resolve and make a bad ending, it RUINS the movie. How could you leave the viewer with a sour taste in their mouth?<br/><br/>Plot: 5/10 for originality Scares: 9/10 for being classic Ending: -1/10 for not even trying<br/><br/>4.3/10"
"cnycitylady","4","2","3","30 October 2013"," Um...What?
","I am not a Horror movie Buff/person. I don't like them so I don't watch them. But in a bonding experience with my brother I decided to put this on. We wanted a horror movie to jerk our senses awake in the middle of the night. We wanted to curl up in blankets too afraid to look over our shoulders for fear that something might be there. But this movie wasn't it. This movie was really more about the undying love mother's have for their children, and the bond that forms between them.<br/><br/>Now I'm not saying that that's a bad plot line, I'm just saying that it disappointed me a bit when watching it. Jessica Chastain made you believe that loving a child happens involuntary at times and you can do nothing about it. Mama shows that the love and desire you have towards being a mother can never truly die, no matter what stands in your way. And all that is great, but I wasn't jumping out of my seat from fear, or angst, and isn't that what a horror movie is supposed to make you do?<br/><br/>Also, the digital effects that they used for Mama were outdated and cheap looking. Whenever she appeared it looked like a Video game creature, and I half expected the camera to be an RPG character with a gun ready to start shooting her. The blatant showing of Mama took away all essence of the creep factor, another essential thing when it comes to horror movies. I guess the monsters should not be shown too frequently, because if you leave it to the imagination, you'll be more terrified.<br/><br/>Overall, I was disheartened by this movie simply because the movie makers went about telling the story the wrong way. It's not the worst horror movie I have ever seen, but it is definitely up there, despite Chastain's take on her grungy, child-hating character. 4/10"

Her character ark through the film shifts and it works very well in synergy with the two little girls Victoria and to some degree Lilly as there bond grows. The supernatural MAMA is a very freaky and scary ghost .The film Guillermo del Toro presents was based on a short film he saw Directed By Barbara Muschietti, Andy Muschietti .

"rosalindjm","9","1","1","24 May 2018"," A lovely horror story!
","Unlike so many, I liked the ending! 
There was resolution between the ghost mother and still feral child, while Annabel becomes a mum (she specifically didn't want the children to call her mum at the start), and the relationship between the couple changed. At the beginning it was all uncle plus children (they were the most important women in his life!) But guess what Annabel is left dumped with them, giving up her glamourous lifestyle to boot, because she loves him. But at the end, haha, daddy/uncle is left crying out for help and is ignored by Victoria and Annabel, although they do accept him into their embrace. So all in all quite a lot to think about. 
Also it could be seen in purely psychological terms, in that maybe Lily never got over her traumas, where as Victoria did. So many adoption families have these struggles everyday and I am sure they are terrifying and sometimes appear supernatural because they are so difficult to get to the bottom of (especially where children have suffered abuse before entering an adoptive family) because noone really knows the history of that childs life and what monsters they have seen.
Also good strong female/mum role model- not slushy, not mumsie she is restrained at times and acting on instinct at other times e.g. what's in the closet? And when she holds on tight to Lily. The lady is full, of love in all the right ways.
Finally, I loved the girls relationship, I loved their interaction and the way Victoria was all proper and ready for her new life while her scruffy sister sat on the floor eating bugs. It was delightful and worrying and creepy all at the same time.One of my best moments is the scene of Lily hiding behind her sister when they entered the house.
Overall a curiously uplifting film!"
"G-Lange","6","1","1","20 May 2017"," From realism into cartoon
","Some movies progress from a cartoonish style into realism â€“ think of the animated flashbacks of Krampus or Harry Potter. This movies does the opposite. In particular, the fiend looks like a fuzzy version of Snow White's evil queen, and we see more and more of her as the movie progresses. It is no surprise that Del Toro produced this movie and was set to direct it. The last scene, with its heavy CGI and exclusively blue color palette seems to have been lifted from Pan's Labyrinth. In other movies, stylization shows how the memory transforms the past into legend. Or how one mind disconnects from reality, like in Pan's Labyrinth. Here there is not much reason for it. It works to the movie's advantage however, as it elevates what threatened to sag into a classic scary girl story into a more memorable fantasy show."

","I didn't really care for this movie too much overall. It drew me in right from the beginning and it stays entertaining enough, but the CGI is not great and it quickly turned into a cheesy ghost story without anything original to offer.<br/><br/>It reminds me a lot of other ghost story movies. It has a similar plot to ""The Ring"" in a way, but is less suspenseful and doesn't work as well. It shows the ""ghost"" a lot, probably too much, instead of leaving more for the imagination, which left me pretty bored in the second half. After it is shown that the ghost can appear whenever and do actual physical harm, it becomes kind of silly to keep dragging the movie on with close calls. <br/><br/>The ending was terrible in my opinion, and I couldn't even finish the last few minutes of the film. I don't want to spoil it, but I will say that its overly dramatic and emotional.<br/><br/>The sound design is great and the film has nice production value other than the CGI.

"Leofwine_draca","5","1","1","11 June 2014"," Flashes of inspiration, but mostly disappointing
","MAMA has plenty of potential, I'll give it that. It's produced by no less than Guillermo del Toro, a man who's had a hand in some of the best ghost stories of recent years (THE ORPHANAGE, THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE). It stars Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, an actor currently riding high thanks to the success of GAME OF THRONES. Unfortunately, though, there are simply too many problems with it to make it a truly successful movie.<br/><br/>In essence, this is another clichéd ghost story along the lines of THE WOMAN IN BLACK or INSIDIOUS. Yet again we're treated to a pair of creepy children who have an invisible friend - except in this case it's a surrogate mother figure who's determined to look out for ""her"" wards no matter what. It all boils down to attempts at creeping dread, ominous shots of wardrobes and out-of-focus ghosts in the backgrounds of shots, and that sort of thing.<br/><br/>What I'm trying to say is that it's all rather predictable and a little wearying in places. The cast work hard but the writing isn't particularly strong when it comes to the characters. Coaster-Waldau spends most of the movie off-screen in a hospital bed, leaving a clearly struggling Jessica Chastain to hold the reins. Unfortunately, Chastain is saddled with one of the most selfish, self-centred protagonists I've seen in a while, leaving a huge dead spot in the centre of the movie.<br/><br/>Sadly, MAMA becomes increasingly silly as it goes on, with more and more of the CGI ghost (who looks like...a CGI ghost) appearing and failing to frighten the viewer. JU-ON: THE GRUDGE this ain't. And it all ends in a rather twee, predictable and unsatisfying way, which is a real shame. A film bogged down by predictability then, instead of genuinely novel ideas."
"saytosandeep","6","1","1","16 March 2014"," MY REVIEW: Oh, What a Waste of Potential!!
","Mama. Created as long feature film from a short Spanish film, Mama has everything that a horror movie asks for. Kids as the central characters so that you always want them out of danger, terrific atmosphere, a chilling mystery and few endearing supporting characters. Still movie never succeeds in pushing the envelope and fails to exploit its potential. Jessica Chastain a rock band member who is given the difficult task of caring about two little girls does good and holds the movie together. But movie belongs to little girls; elder one bridging the emotions of real and super natural world and younger one who enjoys a comfortable relationship with her ghost care taker. First half is good, raising doubts and questions and having few scary moments but second half fails to raise the stakes and summing up the story in a chilling manner. Showing the ghost doesn't work here. I am going with not bad 6 out of 10 for Mama. It could have been much more but restricts itself being a run of mill horror flick."
"natashabowiepinky","6","1","1","15 January 2014"," It could do better...
","This is a difficult film to assess. I enjoyed it for what it was, which is an efficient horror film that'll give you the creeps and has child actors who WON'T make you want to gouge your eyes out. At the same time, I thought it could've gone further in terms of the scenario, but was limited in scope... both by trying to appeal to a mass market, and the need to get a low rating so irresponsible adults could take their kids to see it. Just like Chuck Norris refusing to take part in The Expendables 2 unless they ditched the bad language and graphic violence. They should have just let him go...<br/><br/>Mama is not exactly a terrifying creation... we've seen plenty of nasties like her in this genre before. What makes the movie is the introduction, which is brilliant and sets the scene perfectly, and the atmosphere... full of dark shadows and foreboding... check out what goes on in the background, too. After a while though, an air of predictability descends, we are able to guess who'll survive, what each character will decide to do, where Mama is gonna appear next... and it all becomes rather humdrum. A very nice attempt, but lacking in ambition stops it from reaching it's full potential. 6/10"
"PhantomPimpernel","Null","1","1","22 December 2013"," Tonally Unsound
","This movie does not have a clear tonal goal. While works produced by Guillermo del Toro can possess the ability to juggle a variety of tonal material effortlessly (Pan's Labyrinth, for example), this movie was neither able to commit to a genre nor gracefully shift between tone. What started as a creepy and fairly well done horror film took a sudden shift towards fantasy drama.<br/><br/>This clunky transition occurred during the final quarter of the movie. The ghostly visage of Mama was overexposed to the audience, revealing her as nothing but a wisp of CGI. When seen in flashes, Mama can have a pretty startling effect, but after a few seconds of exposure has her disturbing effect downgraded to mildly unsettling. <br/><br/>This was likely intentional, as the movie's tone switches more towards the desire to save the two nieces and the angst of separation. However, the audience is only inclined to follow this theme after Mama suddenly becomes a dull computer rendering. <br/><br/>If the tonal shift was less abrupt and not reliant on the novelty of an effect wearing off, Mama could have been an excellent movie. Unfortunately, it's at best, a passable horror film with a tonally unsatisfying finale."

Some of the CGI was excellent and the performance of Julia Chantrey very convincing (it's the first time I've seen a film with her in).<br/><br/>Sadly, however, the storyline seemed to move away from a horror and moved towards a fantasy thriller. The conclusion could have – should have – been much more ambitious for what could have been an 8* horror movie."
"reevemallon","5","1","1","8 December 2013"," A fair try with some some interesting moments
","The film seems to constantly border on the line of Horror cliché and interesting ideas. It wouldn't be a horror film without the classic ""don't go into the closet"" or a family moving into a new house. The concept of feral children is an interesting one and the film does offer a promising starting point with the father of the young girls struggling with the murder of his wife and the idea that he may have to murder his children. The sudden contrast between this tender emotional scene and the man suddenly being carried away by a ghost is laughable. The reason for Jeffrey killing is wife is brushed off despite the fact it could have taken about 30 seconds to become a plausible motive (we assume she probably cheated on him). <br/><br/>Despite the clichés the film has some very interesting concepts. Annabel and Lucas don't appear to be the typical couple in horror films and Annabel's reluctance to have children adds a great element to affect the relationship between her, Lucas and the children. Another great idea brushed off (she doesn't put up much of a fight to allow Jean to take the children and only complains once they're in the new house). <br/><br/>The ending is fairly satisfying. The fact that Lily has to leave with Mama adds a great dramatic element to what could be a typical boring horror film ending (They give Mama her baby and all live happily ever after). Something about the spirit does slightly take away from the ending. ""Mama"" is not scary. At all. And terribly ineffective at murdering people. It seems a bit disappointing that she was the figure lurking in the dark the entire time. <br/><br/>The film tries so hard and triumphs at certain points but I don't think I would recommend the film to anyone. It's very miss-able."

","Guillermo has a successful way of giving you only the most important plot details, allowing your mind to construct its own genuine fear. In the movie ""Mama,"" Del Toro, unlike many other modern horror directors, effectively generates fear and suspense while also inducing true empathy. The movie 'Mama' entrances you and brings you back to a true adolescent sense of fear, which bends your adult perception of reality. Mama was an EXCELLENT movie but (in my opinion) suffered from the same disease as many other big budget films-- overuse of CGI. Guillermo, we love your movies for inducing primal fear; please don't take away our capacity to use our imagination."

The evil beings arms seem to resemble inspector gadget's go go arms and it's bad from start to finish. Having been a fan since pan's labyrinth it seems to me that the change really has been since he stopped making Spanish movies and started casting high profile Americans in his leading roles. Add to this the fact that he seems to be producing a lot of work one after another I would say he's substituted quality for quantity.

","Mama is one of the most recent in a spate of decent and atmospheric supernatural horror movies that have been coming out for the last few years. Along with Insidious, it shows that you do not need a ton of gore and violence to make a good horror film.<br/><br/>Mama is the story of Annabel (Jessica Chastain), a rather aimless young woman who has no great plans in life except to bum around the apartment of her boyfriend Jeffrey (Nicolas Coaster-Waldau), an aspiring artist and play bass in a garage punk band. <br/><br/>This all changes when Jeffrey gains custody of his two nieces, who had disappeared in rather lurid circumstances. Jeffrey's twin brother, Lucas (Coster-Waldau again in a dual role) murdered his co-workers and estranged wife, abducting his daughters and disappeared on a mountain road. <br/><br/>Five years later, a pair of professional trackers find the two girls living feral in a deserted cabin with Lucas after Lucas died under mysterious circumstances.<br/><br/>The older Girl, Victoria, was found to have retained her speaking and socialization skills, while the younger girl, Lilly was almost totally animalistic. When questioned about their living conditions, Victoria states that they were cared for by a mysterious entity that they referred to only as ""Mama"". <br/><br/>The film is told completely from Annabel's point of view and Chastain does a good job portraying her ambivalence in suddenly becoming a defacto Mother while showing her frustrations in her attempt to bond with the girls.<br/><br/>Spanish writer/director Andres Muschietti does a deft job of ratcheting up the tension when Annabel realizes that Victoria and Lilly weren't the only beings that were in the cabin. <br/><br/>All in all, I found this film do be a decent attempt to take a hoary old story (caretaker of children in a haunted house) and update it with emotional realism and gravitas. The feral children scenario is unique and fascinating and when the movie sticks with that theme, it's nearly flawless<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the entire story seems to derail in the last act and becomes a ludicrous concoction of plot holes, overwrought melodrama and morally problematic decisions.<br/><br/>***SPOILERS*** <br/><br/>The ending consists of Annabel being faced with a ""Sophie's Choice"" situation of sacrificing one child or both to the vengeful spirit of Mama. Finally, she basically accepts the situation as a no-win and gives one child over to Mama.<br/><br/>I applaud the filmmaker's gutsy decision and have no problem with such a downbeat ending on principle. I just find the actual EXECUTION of such an ending to be so ham-handed, it left me dissatisfied with a rotten taste in my mouth. <br/><br/>That aside, I think the movie was well worth at least a look. If one can overlook the rather silly ending, I think fans of ghost stories might find it diverting."

","Guillermo Del Toro is certainly no small time director. Involved in epics such as 'Hellboy', 'Megamind' and 'Kung Fu Panda', Del Toro has experience in vast amounts of genres and the Spaniard is no stranger to horror with work entailed in 'Julia's Eyes', 'The Orphanage' and 'The Devil's Backbone'. So how does he fair here, collaborating with the Muschietti's over how to produce the anticipated horror 'Mama'.<br/><br/>When a psychologically deranged man murders several of his working colleagues before doing the same to his wife, he whisks his children away with him in the back of his car, driving off in a seething rage. Out of control, he steers off course towards an abandoned cabin in the middle of the woods. Rounding his children inside he prepares to shoot himself - possibly even his children - until a spiritual being intervenes.<br/><br/>Five years later, the children remain missing and their Uncle Lucas (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) is determined not to give up the search. However, when he finally finds them with girlfriend Annabel (Jessica Chastain), they may have picked up more than they bargained for.<br/><br/>'Mama' begins excellently, full of mystery and suspense as we are brought together with an intriguing story line. After the early prologue and approximately twenty minutes of foundation building, rhetorical questions develop in your head and shivers begin to tingle up your spine. At this point, Mama (voiced by Jane Moffat) herself is full of mystery; we know so little about her and this is why she is so creepy.<br/><br/>The film begins to fall into decline when it unravels. When you see Mama in her true form - yes it looks a little freaky - but not nearly as scary as before when you didn't know what to expect. This gripe also links to her looking too unrealistic. The CGI is good but looks too out of place in in the film.<br/><br/>Other negatives include the black humour which allows you a breathing space to emit your terror away from yourself. It just gives you that breathing space - if you are so terribly terrified - to remember it is just a movie.<br/><br/>However, my main frustration is the appalling ending which is utterly ridiculous and farcical! Jessica Chastain was superb in her role as the first-time child minder Annabel while Megan Charpentier was equally as good as Victoria - the two main stand-out performances in a decent cast set-up."

In other words, it wasn't as bad as other modern horror movies. The end, however, was just....god awful. It was painfully obvious that whoever wrote this movie had no freaking idea how to end it. The result of this? One of the worst endings to a horror movie I have ever seen In my entire life. They exposed said ""mama"" WAY too much. the CGI made this movie incredibly hard to take seriously.To be honest, the ending ruined the whole movie for me, which is why I do not recommend seeing it. Save your money, folks. And ignore the hype that this movie has received because let me tell you, this movie is not worth your time."

","I don't want to write too much about this movie's plot. I will say - don't watch a late showing... you won't want to go home in the dark after watching this one. <br/><br/>The movie MAMA proves why imaginatively-written supernatural horror movies are so much better than the ""slasher"" genre of movie. MAMA is creepy, dark and totally unpredictable. The special effects are incredible.<br/><br/>Pay close attention to everything that's going on in the foreground - and especially the background, in every moment of every scene of this film.<br/><br/>And don't watch it alone..."

","Originally seeing the trailer I thought this was a great concept and an interesting idea, I was really excited for this but when I actually saw it in theatres I was a little less than pleased.<br/><br/>The children are by far the best actor's in the film, playing the role of animalistic kids fairly well but this also leads to a lot of laughable moments as they appear more like Gollum than anything truly scary. The movie is very laughable sadly, the appearances of Mama with her head half out of the floorboard looks like somebody put a wig on a roomba and let it scoot around.<br/><br/>The film goes really down hill during that dream sequence, as it appears to be a video game cut scene out of a FPS Rail shooter, the over use of CGI in a terribly contrived ending makes the movie feel like it's running 20 minutes too long.<br/><br/>Also, having a jump scare a minute and twenty seconds in doesn't help your case. <br/><br/>It was a fairly decent attempt for a first theatrical release from the director but hopefully his next projects are a little better."

","This is one of those pictures where the previews are far far scarier than the actual movie. Nothing in the film makes to much sense. There seems to be no logical reason for anything to be happening. It turns out to be a very simple ghost story. The middle part of the film is what let the whole production down. For about an hour nothing much happens to advance the story...it is an hour of ""whoops...I see the ghost...whoops it went away"" This central hour of the film goes on too long like that. The only good part is the representation of the ghost...they did a pretty good job of imagining her. All the actors are rather forgettable."
"phunnyconflicts","8","3","7","27 January 2013"," Great horror to start 2013 (Spoiler Alert!!!)
","Mama starts out as your usual horror movie. A cabinet, a dark shadow, and mystery.<br/><br/>But as the movie progress, viewers starts to see character development. First and foremost, the girls gradually starts to adapt back into our world. Then Annabell, who wanted noting to do with kids, slowly starts to form a relationship with the two kids, Victoria and Lilly.<br/><br/>Annabell starts to care for them, and it really shows - which is nice for a horror movie. For a brief moment, Mama showed that it was different compared to other horror movies. Characters in Mama actually changed and evolve, which is so darn refreshing for a horror movie.<br/><br/>Towards the end, I'll admit, it wasn't so much as scary, but more of a sci-fi feel. But that's okay for me, as it just helps the story move from point A to point B. Ultimately, I can see why they changed the pacing of the movie. It resolved the story and to me, felt complete, even though it was a tragic ending. Its honestly better than a ghost popping up in the end, extracting vengeance like most horror movies does so cheaply and then ending the movie in a big cliff hanger (like The Women in Black - although good movie, a clichÃ© ending that just about every horror-ghost movie has).<br/><br/>Granted, while I believe this movie was really good, it however was not perfect. There were scenes and moments in the movie where I just did not agree with. For instance, the scene were Dr. Dreyfuss entered the cabinet by himself was a useless scene. We all knew he was going to die, so why dragged on his death? Actually, his death was quit mealiness - which serve no purpose other than knowing that Mama is a violent ghost, but we all knew that from the very beginning.<br/><br/>Then there was the scene where Uncle Lucas leaves the hospital and into the woods. That scene felt incomplete, or its as if they edited a scene out. And if they didn't, then it obviously serves no purpose as Lucas did not learn anything when traveling to the woods other than meeting up with Annabell later. And yes, I know, his dead brother told him to go there, but again, he learned noting. To me, it just felt like an extra scene to prolong the movie. They could of made better use of that character and scene.<br/><br/>Regardless, even with a couple of disagreeable scenes, I still think this movie was really good. The story overall is noting new by any stretch of the imagination, but sometimes, we do not need a new super complex story. We just need something slightly different but done in a better way.<br/><br/>Overall, I was highly pleased with this movie and a great start to 2013 horror genre."
"ghost_dog86","6","3","7","22 January 2013"," The Caucasian La Llorona
","Remember when you were young and your mom told you that if you didn't treat her well, then she would come back and haunt you from beyond the grave?...No?...Really?! Uhhh, wellÂ…directed by Andres Muschietti (NOT GUILLERMO DEL TORO) ""Mama"" is the newest January horror release attempting to not massively disappoint a wide array of critics. And while (as far as new age horror films go) I thought ""Mama"" was for the most part pretty effective and will be giving this movie a recommendation, I am also recommending that (for the most enjoyable experience) one walk out of this movie around 15 minutes before the final credits roll, when this film completely falls apart. <br/><br/>There is a storyline here concerning two creepy little girls who are found seemingly alone in the woods (but in fact are being watched over by a jealous ghost named Mama) and are taken in by their estranged uncle and his hard rock, tattooed girlfriend (played by Jessica Chastain) but truthfully the more you pay attention to the quite sappy and overcomplicated plot, the more distracted (much like in last year's ""The Woman in Black"") you will be from the real star of ""Mama"", the scares themselves. In fact the parts that don't work here are the awkwardly clunky exposition and (as I alluded to before) the final 15 minutes when ""Mama"" becomes once again back-story motivated, with an inexplicably nonsensical and Disney-esque ""the ghost must learn her lesson too"" ending. And nobody wants to see that. In fact, most of the time the scariest things about some of the great horror movie monsters stem from their unexplained motives; a la, the less we (the audience) knows about the monster, other than it wants to kill and deliver scares, the scarier the movie becomes. Therefore, the back-story behind Mama being a sort of Caucasian version of ""La Llorona"" would have worked immensely well on scares alone, if not for a need by these filmmakers (Muschietti and writer Neil Cross) to give an overly dramatic character explanation, humanizing the monster and taking all of the wind out of Mama's sails. <br/><br/>What does work in this movie's favor are the horror genre visuals which make up a large portion of the middle chunk of this film. OK, so while some of the scares may seem cheap, the Mama ""monster"" is pretty damn scary. Furthermore, what initially may seem like cheap scares, quickly turn into cheap yet effective scares throughout (clearly exceeding the classic 6 scare rule). There are even a few rather well constructed horror genre directorial choices that while won't be classified as scares, will be seen as rather creepy moments. <br/><br/>As for Chastain playing the rocker chick/girlfriend/adopted mother in all of this (with her Misfit's t-shirt, black nail polish and her many, many bracelets) she gives a performance that while isn't a cinematic nose dive (the likes of Natalie Portman going from ""Black Swan"" to ""Your Highness"") it is one that can only be described as pretty much that of zero substance. Which is to say, she's not bad, nor is she good; she is more so wasted in a rocker chick role which will undoubtedly be forgotten in the years to come.<br/><br/>Final Thought: All in all, if you are looking to see a horror (or date) movie that does deliver in the visual scares department and are willing to ignore the annoyingly distracting storyline, then ""Mama"" may be the movie for you. But if I said it once, I'll say it a million times, if you choose not to walk out of this movie 15 minutes before it's over, then don't come crying to me. I warned you. <br/><br/>Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I. Ashland<br/><br/>Follow me on Twitter @moviesmarkus"
"keiichi73","8","3","7","18 January 2013"," A stylish and effective early-year thriller
","Whenever an actor or actress currently up for an Oscar appears in a horror film, it's usually a sure sign that said actor is ""slumming it"" or ""cashing a paycheck"". This would appear to be doubly true if said horror film is released in the usually dreary month of January. But in the case of Jessica Chastain, she treats her role here with respect. She's giving a real performance here, and it's a good one. It also helps a lot that Mama is much better than the kind of horror we usually get this time of year. It's genuinely creepy, kind of suspenseful, and a hell of a lot of fun.<br/><br/>Mama grabs our attention right from the start with a great prologue, concerning a father and businessman (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) having a mental breakdown in the brink of a financial meltdown. He's murdered two of his co-workers, and as the film opens, has just arrived home to murder his estranged wife. With the job done, he grabs his two young daughters, Victoria (age 3) and Lilly (age 1), and drives off with them. He doesn't seem to have a plan as to where he's running off to with the girls, and in his haste, the car slides off the icy roads, landing in the middle of the woods below. Everyone manages to survive, and make their way to a seemingly-abandoned cabin in the middle of the woods. As is frequently the case with cabins in horror movies, it is inhabited by an evil and shadowy entity who immediately kills the father, but takes pity on the two young girls.<br/><br/>Flash forward five years later, and we're introduced to Lucas, the brother of the ill-fated man in the opening scenes, who is also played by Coaster-Waldau in a dual role. He's a struggling artist, living with his punk rocker girlfriend, Annabel (Jessica Chastain) in a small apartment. For the past five years, he's organized searching parties for the two missing girls. Word finally comes that the two girls have been found. They're still in the cabin where we left them, only now, they have grown feral, having lived mostly on their own in the wilderness all this time. Young Victoria is now played by Megan Charpentier, while her little sister Lilly is played by Isabelle Nelisse. The children are placed in a psych hospital under the care of the shady Dr. Dreyfus (Daniel Kash), who seems particularly fascinated in the story the girls tell of ""mama"", a shadowy figure who lived in the walls of the cabin, and took care of them during the years they were alone.<br/><br/>Eventually, Victoria and Lily are well enough to live with Lucas and Annabel. For Annabel, this is not the ideal situation, as she is not interested in being a mother in the first place. Shortly after the girls move into the new home that Lucas has provided for them, ominous things begin to happen. They are somewhat innocent at first. In one particularly memorable scene, we see little Lilly playing with someone (who remains off camera) in her bedroom, which should be impossible, since we see everyone else in the house outside the bedroom, going about their daily lives, oblivious to what's going on just around the corner. It's a scene that brings to mind the playfulness of Spielberg when he built suspense in films like Close Encounters or Poltergeist. Of course, we know that ""mama"" has followed the girls to their new home, and is not happy that they now have new parents looking after them.<br/><br/>Mama is a horror movie that's just as interested in having us grow attached to its characters, as much as it is in scaring us. The fact that it is successful on both fronts is no small feat. The movie takes its time, letting us get to know these characters and their situations, while all the while, we know that something is wrong. It's a skillful blend of human drama and a first-rate supernatural thriller that, yes, does borrow a lot of ideas from other films (there seem to be a lot of nods to Japanese horror), but does so in an effective way.<br/><br/>For most of its running time, ""mama"" chooses to stay mostly in the background. During the third act, she reveals herself through CG and a performance by Spanish actor Javier Botet. Quite frankly, she's scarier when she stays in the shadows. In fact, the last 15 minutes fall apart, because we see too much of her. Up until then, this had been a subtle, intelligent, and creepy thriller. Then, it all explodes in a rushed climax of special effects and half-baked plot developments. Before all that does happen, however, I loved every minute of this film. And even the ending, flawed as it is, isn't enough to drag down what works. The performances, the atmosphere, and the unusual amount of intelligence rarely seen in a Hollywood horror film all outweighs any negatives. Director and co-writer Andy Muschietti, his team of writers, and producer Guillermo del Toro have set out to create an effective and smart little ghost story, and have strongly succeeded.<br/><br/>Speaking of del Toro, the movie reminded me of another film he did a few years ago called The Orphanage. Both are classically-styled and atmospheric ghost stories surrounding troubled children. The Orphanage was widely looked over in the U.S., due to the fact it was a foreign film with subtitles. Given that Mama is a full-scale Hollywood production, it hopefully will be greeted much more warmly by audiences, as it deserves."
"laojim","5","5","15","18 January 2013"," Noisy and stupid movie ends with a bit of real drama.
","This is a movie in which every few minutes there is a burst of really loud and annoying noise, usually matched with something rushing toward you too fast to make out. Not until the ending do you get a good look at what was lurking around for the previous hour of so.<br/><br/>There is little or nothing happening in the movie except that the lurking monster is gradually revealed as the kinds, who are the protagonists, have different attitudes toward it. The shame of the film is that this difference of opinion is of no significance until the final scene, when is should have been the focus of the film instead of the squabbling guardians. There lurks and interesting tale.<br/><br/>There are a number of dangling threads and oddities in the movie which might well have been tied up. The house, for example, in which the children are left has a name by the door, Helvetia, which is a name for Switzerland, but which does not appears again except for a brief glimpse. We are supposed to believe that the children subsisted on cherries, a crop that is highly seasonal and not available when the action takes place, at least not available to those with no access to modern food distribution systems. The woods are filled with brilliant white lights which cast ominous shadows for the convenience of people stumbling around at night. There is also a vast archive in the courthouse of a small Pennsylvania county which nicely symbolic, but rather over done.<br/><br/>Leaving such threads aside the real story, which does not depend on anything that took place in the bulk of the film except for one child's affection for her rescuers, only begins after a curiously pointless encounter in the house in the woods and a second glimpse of the Helvetia sign. It would be an excellent story to be told by someone with a talent for scary movies that are actually worth watching, someone like, oh, I don't know, maybe del Toro or someone like that, if there is anyone like that. What little there is of this ending might well be the basis for a much better movie to be made at a later date and is almost worth sitting through all the noisy noise in rest of this thing."

","So in all honesty, I'm picky about my horror. If the film implies there's a monster it had darn well better be a monster, I don't care of it's Godzilla or something more paranormal. Seems to me these days 'horror' is less about those things and more about the scary thing being the product of mental illness or just some creepy but ultimately human thing. Or on a Saw level just blood and gore and guts and not anything else that's actually scary.<br/><br/>This is where I wish there were more movies like Mama. It's a perfect balance of yes, there is actually a monster combined with the perfect amount of jump scares in just the right places. Not so many as to make them less effective over the course of the movie, but enough to keep you on edge as to where the next one might be.<br/><br/>On top of that it involves children being the creepy ones in addition to the monster, and children being creepy always just seems to add to the scary factor of a movie.<br/><br/>This has become one of my favorite horror movies over the years, one I keep turning to as a prime example of what the horror genre should be."

Also, the ending was very unsatisfactory to me, it was sort of like a dead end to me. Overall, this film is boring, bland, poorly put together, and to be honest not worth your time.

","Mama is the story about two girls who have inadvertently been left alone in the woods to fend for themselves. Five years on, they are miraculously found alive and are rescued by a search party organised by their uncle. Unfortunately, as time goes on, it is evident that someone - or something - had been looking after the two children and that that something has been brought back with them.<br/><br/>This movie was excellent and it was just as good as I was hoping for. It started off really well, and kept a nice steady pace going throughout all the way through to the somewhat sad ending. It most definitely picks up in the last 40 minutes as well. I'll be honest and say that at one point, about halfway through, I thought it wasn't going to pickup or get much better than what it had up to then. Boy, was I wrong! Mama is a very creepy movie (yet at the same time quite sad as well) and the way the character of Mama was done was impressive. The movement for that character is reminiscent in parts to that of the ""ghosts"" in Ju-on and Ringu which just adds to the creep factor for me. Also, the way the CGI was mixed with live actors for Mama was done really well, which makes me wonder what movie was being watched by people who complained about it being ""rubbish"". For a movie that had an estimated budget of only $15m it was anything but ""rubbish"".<br/><br/>The performances were good all round, but the best by an absolute country mile were the two girls, Megan Charpentier (who played Victoria) and Isabelle NÃ©lisse (who played Lilly). They both brought a real believability to their characters with convincing performances showing two girls who, for five years, had to fend for themselves and then have to try and adjust to living in modern society.<br/><br/>Like I said earlier, this is an excellent film and I think it's the best horror/chiller I've seen since Sinister.

","We see suicidal Jeffrey take his daughters Victoria (3) and Lilly (1) deep into the woods, having killed their mother and his business partners, with the intention of killing them and then himself. Before he can do so, we see something through Victoria's spectacles-less eyes pull him away and break his neck. Jeffrey's brother Lucas never gives up looking for his disappeared family members and 5 years later the two girls, now feral, are found. Victoria's pre-existing speech skills enable her rehabilitation to be started relatively easily: Lilly remains fairly unreachable. Victoria attributes their survival to Mama, and the audience has a pretty good idea that Mama may well be more real than anyone suspects.<br/><br/>This is a good old-fashioned horror story, ghost based, and like all horror stories, it's as good as its monster. I found the monster here a good one. It provides a decent amount of teasing, sudden scares and the like, and manages to be both menacing and sympathetic. You also get a fair amount of ""reveal"" towards the end which may disappoint: for me, it didn't.<br/><br/>The cast is excellent. Jessica Chastain as Lucas' partner, stuck with substitute motherhood she didn't really want, as an effective central character, Nicolaj Coaster-Waldau is solid as both Jeffrey and Lucas, but it is the little girls who thrill.

","Originally having some mix feelings to seeing the movie due to having found the trailer unexpectedly disappointing,I began to become very interested in seeing the film as quickly as possible,after reading some comments from fellow IMDb'ers who found the film to be an atmospheric,chilling ghost story,which lead to me deciding,that I would pay,what would hopefully be a pretty special visit to Mama.<br/><br/>The plot-2008:<br/><br/>Crashing his car in an isolated woodland area,Jeffery and his two daughters Lily and Victoria walk around the woods, until they suddenly stumble upon a rusty looking cabin,which they all decide to enter,due to it looking like it has not been inhabited for a number of decades.<br/><br/>Losing all his sense of parental moral after having murdered his wife and business partners,Jeffery prepares to finish the family tragedy by shooting both of his daughters,and then commit suicide.Getting set to kill his first daughter,Jeffery is caught by surprise when a ghost suddenly appears and stops him from firing the gun by breaking his neck.Finding Lily and Victoria to now be on their own,the ghost (who they both call Mama) decides that she will stay with both of them in the cabin,and raise them as if they were her own children.<br/><br/>5 Years later:<br/><br/>Reciving the phone call that they had almost given up on ever receiving,Jeffery's brother Luke and his girlfriend Annabel rush down to a psychological clinic,where they both find out that Victoria and Lily were both found alive and living in a long forgotten woodland cabin.<br/><br/>Getting advice from psychiatric Dr.Gerald Dreyfuss about how to re- introduce the girls to the real world,Annabel and Jeffery begin to fear that the 5 years that Victoria and Lily spent living on their own in the cabin may have had a far greater psychological effect on them then originally expected,due to them catching Lily and Victoria secretly talk to an imaginary motherly figure,who they happily name ""Mama""Â…<br/><br/>View on the film:<br/><br/>Unvailing Mama's (who is astonishingly played by a real man!:Javier Botet) full appearance within the first 10-15 minutes of the film,the screenplay by director Andres Muschietti,Neil Cross and Barbara Muschietti take ""the villain"" out of the dark corners of the screen and into the light early on,so that instead of Mama being a simple 2D baddie,the writers take a refreshing approach by gradually going through the painful, psychological background that has caused Mama to be a damaged soul,which also leads to one of the main characters openly crying over the abuse that Mama experienced.<br/><br/>Whilst the writers do well at building on the background details related to Mama,I feel that the puzzle solving thread that the main characters were attempting to finish was sadly left with a number of pieces missing,with the investigation of the children's imaginary friend Mama by Gerald Dreyfuss, (played by a stern Daniel Kash) giving the film a tense atmosphere of it preparing to deliver a truly knock-out twist,which it disappointingly never unleashes,due to the way that it wraps up Dreyfuss extremely intriguing thread,being one which leads to a strong impression that huge parts of his plot line ended up on the cutting room floor.<br/><br/>Taking the wonderful ending of the movie in a brave direction,the writers make Mama's and the children's connection with nature, (shown from Mama's intro scene where she gives the kids some nuts/berries to eat)one that is deeply entwined to the family connection that Annabel and Luke are trying to straighten towards Lily and Victoria,with the ending of the film being an excellent poetic note,which shows,that in the end no one wins. <br/><br/>Along with putting a recurring moth motif in the film right at the centre, and also featuring suggestion's of reincarnation,which revels that Annabel,Luke and Mama's terrifying battle against each other has been one over getting Victoria and Lily to agree to either live with their ""nuclear"" parents in Annabel and Luke,or to keep the nature bond that they have with Mama.<br/><br/>Looking gorgeous at being Punk'ed up,Jessica Chastain gives a terrific performance as Annabel.Giving her chillingly atmospheric scenes with Mama a tough edge,by showing,that despite having a ghost trying to kill her,Annabel is not prepared to let a ghost knock her down,Chastain also makes Annabel's relationship between Lily and Victoria (both played perfectly by Isabelle Nelisse and Megan Charpentier) one that delicately progresses from feeling cold and icy towards them,to doing everything in her power to keep a strong grip with Victoria and Lily,who she desperately wants to be as far a way from Mama's supernatural grip as much as possible.<br/><br/>Bringing an unexpected warmth to the film,Nikolaj Costrer-Waldau gives a great,double sided performance as Luke and Jeffery, (something which is oddly not included as an element in the plot) with Waldau showing the warmth Luke has towards Lily and Victoria that Annabel slowly catches,and also impressively,shows Jeffery someone who is dead behind the eyes and at his wits end,who sees that the only thing he can do is to murder his daughters.<br/><br/>Displaying a confidence that most established directors would love to have,from one of the first scenes in the movie where the camera tracks Jeffery going from his car and walking up to a cop,feature film debuting Andres Muschietti uses astonishingly complex,stylised camera moves to create a tremendously chilling, haunting atmosphere.<br/><br/>Fully showing the house that Annabel and the kids find themselves trapped in,in an almost hostage like way,Muschietti expertly sends a shiver down the viewers spine by using the elegant,long tracking shots to build an unforgettable feeling of dread that Mama may be about to appear from the very edge of the screen,and also smartly making some of the most nerve wreaking moments in the film be in-camera tricks,which leads to Muschietti pushing the audience right to the edge of their seats,by making the viewer terrified,that what may originally appear to be children playing in their own shadows,may in fact be Mama's arrival home."
"gstepup","10","2","4","19 February 2013"," Muschietti, del Toro and Chastain create the perfect ghost movie with an added conceit
","From Guillermo del Toro, the visionary behind CRONOS (1993), MIMIC (1997), BLADE 2 (2002), HELLBOY (2004), and PAN'S LABYRINTH (2006)... and newbie director AndrÃ©s Muschietti, MAMA is an electrifying ghost movie that hits the right spots.<br/><br/>*Warning: descriptionary spoilers.*<br/><br/>The chilling prologue (of how the two very young kids were abandoned by a deranged father, and left to fend for themselves), has the viewer glued frightened to his/her seat, and from the first shot (eerily photographed by Antonio Riestra) down to the shocker ending, the scares relentlessly pile up on one another! The inevitable ghost shows itself layer by layer (initially a dark hole in the wall with moths creeping out freakishly, then an ominous shadow, then an unearthly cackle and a hypnotic lullaby, then a blackened, wizened hand straight out of the HARRY POTTER films, etc.) until the complete apparition displays itself in full (deathly) regalia. While I posted some cases of children being raised by feral animals in my FaceBook wall, MAMA adopts an even trickier and more freakish concept -- and even if I seem to be spoiling the surprise here, you can connect the dots and even predict the plot, although Muschietti and producer del Toro craft the film as if the ""ghost"" plot and ""feral children"" subplot should already be obvious to the viewer, and instead concentrate on revving up the scare factor -- full blast. Laudably (for a horror movie), the support characters are well drawn: a determined psychiatrist, a busybody and righteous aunt, the feral children, and even the brief role of the deranged father... while the two leads (Jessica Chastain and Danish actor Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) are cast perfectly (although the handsome Coaster-Waldau, midway through MAMA, spends the rest of the film in the hospital, having survived a close call with the titular specter... remember poor Eric Stoltz in ANACONDA?) Chastain, an actress on a roll (after her starmaking performances in two 2011 film, THE TREE OF LIFE and THE HELP, and her lead role in the recent ZERO DARK THIRTY), is simply tremendous, never hitting a false note as a punker girlfriend reluctantly forced to take care of the two kids and save them from something horrible and unfathomable. Intelligently, the script (by Muschietti, Barbara Muschietti and Neil Cross) avoids predictability by having Chastain play a punker who is never bitchy or obnoxious, but rather, finds it in her heart to be a surrogate mother to two young kids from the vengeful and covetous claws of the titular specter. The two young kids playing the feral children, Megan Charpentier (as the older Victoria) and Isabel NÃ©lisse (as the younger, deeply traumatized Lily) are incredible. (SPOILER!!!) The scene where (after the children have been missing for 5 years) the children are first encountered in a creepy house is bound to haunt your memory for months to come! Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, a handsome Danish 43-year-old who looks 20 years younger, offers two uncanny performances: as the deranged father ready to kill his wife and children, and the softhearted brother, Uncle Lucas to the kids. If you were blown over by the panoramic visuals of del Toro's PAN'S LABYRINTH or impressed by the hellish settings of del Toro's HELLBOY, expect a different palette here -- a ghost story with a trick conceit, directed with flair, intelligently performed, hitting all the right spots the way a proper horror movie should!"

","""Mama"" is a 2013 horror film directed by Andy Muschietti starring Jessica Chastain and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau. A few years before Argentinian novice director more or less successfully helmed both remake adaptations of the classic Stephen King novel ""IT"" and became known to a broader audience, he kind of acquired renown within the genre with his quite popular yet not really successful full length feature debut. I personally heard a lot of things about it, most of them being positive and to know that Guillermo Del Toro produced this film made me believe it to be true. To be honest, after seeing images and short sequences of the trailer when I was actually not allowed to see it (thanks to German advertisement) I was scared to watch it at all, although I'm sure that I've probably seen even worse by now, but what am I to say? Childhood fears stick with you for a while against all rationality. Regardless, I took my courage in both hands and had the guts to give it a watch, although I admittedly was about to abort mission already during the menu. Turns out though, that the scenes that are shown during this short sequence are already the creepiest scenes and sadly the only highlights. Even if this flick is far from being abysmal, it still has several undeniable flaws that disturb the overall experience. First, I personally could not believe Chastain in her emo punk goth chick role with the black dyed hair and tattoos, it seemed extremely insincere to me and far away from credible. It appeared to be more of a masquerade than anything that fits to an actual fictional personality to me and sadly lacked the authenticity that keeps it from appearing unintentionally hilarious, but the more the film proceeded, the more I astonishingly grew accustomed to it, solely thanks to Chastain's talent and the effort she has put into this role and it is those factors that make it tolerable to a certain degree. Next to this, the film started out in a promising way and put some effort in building up a specific atmosphere, but the more the film moved on the less packing it became. While I was on the verge of covering my face with my blanket in the beginning, it was nowhere near it in the end, because the films suspense curved dropped gradually. How does this happen? Well, it is happening when you have a genuinely scary entity but don't know how to deal with it properly. What I mean is the simple fact that Mama was way creepier when she was only implied and not actually visible on screen. Aware of the fact that she was not completely computer animated and played by an actual actor, the phenomenal Javier Botet, gave it some extra vehemence to it, yet is doesn't change the fact that its full potential hasn't been used in the slightest. Nevertheless, the camera work and especially the use of long shots out of a hidden camera angle created some dense atmosphere, as it suggested that the audience is watching the helpless protagonist and also some subliminally effective scares that are only thrown in by the way also help building up the atmosphere immensely. Why did it go wrong then? The answer is monotony. After it used this certain formula for a few times it became repetitive and hence lost the threatening power it used to have in the beginning and became boringly predictable. The only reason I still flinched at some scenes was simply due to the fact that the sound mixing was extremely unbalanced, in other words the dialogue was mostly quiet and almost inaudible, which is why I turned up the volume multiple times while the scenes you are supposed to jump off your seat at are extremely loud by nature. I'm aware that this a common practice in horror films, but those scenes in here weren't that intimidating that I'd consider them to be jump scares at all. In this case it's more of a cheap trick to compensate the lack of originality and factual horror. In addition to that, the story also did not do much about keeping the atmosphere intact and thus mistreated the promising exposition immensely. Sadly, the plot really does not flesh out the personality and background story of Mama enough and scratches on the very surface only. They could have gone way deeper into the historical aspect of the story, explored the human background of what Mama eventually became develop her personality and motivations of her haunting more. Instead, we only get a brief insight into her past without any further explanation. It is only just enough but could have been way more interesting and that is kind of frustrating. They even mention and define the meaning of a ghost and how it is the pure manifestation of extreme feelings, yet they don't explain her emotionality enough to make it completely comprehensible. It is not like that they leave it out completely, but it just doesn't feel right to me, it is simply not enough for me personally. Furthermore, there are some plot decisions that don't really fit into the story. Next to the uselessness of Mama showing Annabel her backstory (there was actually no need for her to know, only for the audience) the character of Luke is actually pointless for the story as well. The meaning he has in the story is that he is the cool uncle, but aside from this he is useless for the story as well and the dream or vision he has also doesn't bring anything important to the further scenes. It is no surprise that the character constellation somehow reminded me of the ""Silent Hill"" movie, because like said title this film also is about maternal bonds (who would have guessed it with that title?) and this is the only thing that gives some personality to Mama, as it characterizes her basic motivations. She is inherently not hostile, but extremely protective and jealous in her own way. With the sadly way too short but enough glimpse at her backstory I even felt bad for her in some way, as it explains her endless spook. That is why I absolutely don't understand the final climax. In my humble opinion, her haunting as well as the film should have ended after she was reunited with the remains of what used to be the baby she accidentally killed. Not only would it have been metaphorical and concluded the films symbolism, it would have rounded up the film in a pleasant way as well, as she found her humanity again. But it doesn't end there. Instead, she makes the same mistake again by throwing her infants bones over the cliff again and tries to claim the child she is aware of isn't rightfully hers. After that moment, my sympathy for her vanished immediately, because all those actions contradict her role as a victim and make her the perpetrator instead. The desired redemption I hoped to see was bitterly tainted after this. Having had a discussion with her afterwards, my mother on the other hand disagreed with me, as she thinks that Lilly never would have had the chance to reintegrate into society and that the only way for her to find peace was to go with the only mother figure she has ever had, but it did not feel right to me. That is only a proof how deeply divided the opinions about the same topic might be. I guess the reason why my Mom understood the ending differently is that she is a mother herself, an interpersonal relationship I will never experience myself. She comprehends it on a level I can only imagine, and it think that's an interesting point of view. All in all, this horror drama has the correct approaches, but the execution lacks the innovation that its premise promised it to be. While scary in the beginning, it progressively became less and less scary and more and more repetitive in its repertoire of scares. Aside from a few illogical things and obvious discrepancies it managed to offer a mediocre and minimally atmospheric experience. While it is far from being outstanding or memorable, it knows to entertain the audience in a cheap way. Could have been more but even worse at the same time."

","This movie's been out a long time now. I've just finished watching it here in the throes of coronavirus pandemic March when it's a 2013 piece and I only learned of it via Cordery FX and his excellent YouTube channel.<br/><br/>I still put off watching it quite some time. I watch so many dreadful movies. This one though, is actually one I can recommend. It's reminiscent of Nell, the 1994 Jodie Foster movie - if Nell and her sister had been raised by the murderous ghost of an escaped mental patient from the Edwardian period. If Nell and The Babadook did the fusion dance. Glad I finally got around to seeing it.<br/><br/>I love ghost stories, I'm fascinated by feral children and this movie actually made me feel things. I see so much pure garbage, I forget that movies are supposed to make you feel things.
The child actresses were uncommonly brilliant, there's no happy ending, the Mama is left morally ambiguous.<br/><br/>I had some issue with the CG effects. The schitck to this movie is, the Mama comes from a CGI hole in a wall - which moths fly out of. The Mama moves in that scrawny, jerky, twisted way ghost effects are created these days. Sure, she's creepy, but we've seen this method too many times to be frightened. The Mama's voice is something between a bear and a pigeon, a coo and roar at once, which when phrased that way is symbolic.<br/><br/>The main character in this movie is the uncle's girlfriend. Not only is it refreshing to see an uncle be treated as a sympathetic character in a movie, the girlfriend is pushed to the forefront when the Mama tries to kill him and he is sidelined in hospital. I enjoy those different sort of treatments in character writing. Though there is a scene where we area asked to believe a Bloodhound could track a 5 year old trail (I'm a former dog trainer - that's so absurdly a c'mon, man - that well, just forget about it) but those are my only gripes. Mama is one of the better movies I've seen in a long time.<br/><br/>Yes, it has predictable components, but it's far from the same old same old in ghost stories.<br/><br/>""It's about family.""
Family and obsession and love and torment and death."

","Well, quite a surprise this, so ignore the detractors, this is one creepy, scary and most effective horror, throughout. Director, Andy Muschietti does well under the guidance of Guillermo del Toro, whose own films, strangely enough I am not particularly fond of. This one gets a grip of you from the very start and does not let go as things get worse and worse. The ending is the only part I would take issue with and I feel that here the master probably leaned a little to heavily on Muschietti as it lacks the minimalism of the rest of the film. The two girls are great, particularly the elder, Megan Charpentier and Jessica Chastain also impresses in the lead. It is the direction though that most impresses and to learn that his next film was IT makes me think maybe I should see it after all."
"havocnitzan","9","0","0","23 July 2019"," Exquisite acting, genuinely terrifying, just a little short of a true Horror masterpiece!
","This has been my second time watching Mama, the first was a few years back before I took a fancy to documenting my Horror viewing experiencing. I must start off by saying that while I had remembered the film as pretty good, I didn't remember how remarkable and absolutely exquisite it had been! In a genre plagued by mediocrity and lack of innovation, Mama is a well overdue ray of terrifying darkness, giving the most distinguished titles of the past decade a fair and honest run for their money.<br/><br/>The story is creepy, discomforting and heart-squeezing from the start. In a dramatic and terrible turn of events two girls, aged around five and one, find themselves abandoned in an old secluded and decrepit wooden shack. About five years pass before they are finally found and allegedly rescued, five years during which they have miraculously survived. Or perhaps ""miraculous"" isn't the right way to put it, as whatever it is that watched over them might not be as benevolent as first thought to be. Then again, it obviously isn't evil (having been the sole factor responsible for the girls' survival)... Or is it?<br/><br/>Three things make Mama stand out and flaunt its artistic and horrifying value. First and foremost, the acting. Wow, the acting... While I've always been easily impressed by professional and authentic character-portrayal by younger actors and actresses, little Victoria (Megan Charpentier, 12 years old) and Lilly (Isabelle Nelisse, 10 years old) are by far two of the most talented young Horror actresses I've ever seen. Following the instructions of writer and director Andy Muschietti, they delivered a masterpiece performance of two little girls removed from human society and deprived of their very humanity, moving, sounding and behaving like beasts of the wild. Even if you watch the first 30 minutes or so and nothing more - Victoria and Lilly's predicament and Charpentier and Nelisse's incredible ability to show and deliver it to the audience are as terrifying as they are amazingly impressive.<br/><br/>Second, the smart use of audio effects. I've honestly never been as frightened by how a supernatural antagonist sounds, as opposed to how it looks. The guttural moans, the wimping, the cries and the shrieks of rage would make anyone uncomfortable at least, and terrified at most. Don't get me wrong, the antagonist and namesake of the film looks horrifying (I'll be getting to that soon), but it sounds even worse. Honestly, I could be blind and still have trouble sleeping after ""watching"" this.<br/><br/>And last but not least, Mama herself. I've been a devout Horror enthusiast for 20 years or so (I'm currently 34) and yet no ghost or creature on screen has ever given me greater chills than Javier Botet as Mama. She doesn't really appear supernatural, more unnatural or even sub-natural. Deformed, revolting and disheartening, the fear of seeing her on screen becomes one of the key Horror factors after the first time she appears. It's like, I wasn't afraid for the characters and of the story as I was of seeing her again, and that's a feature very few Horror antagonist can boast.<br/><br/>However, for the sake of objectivity and fairness, certain features of the film could (and indeed should) have been planned and executed better. First, as wisely noted by the review I've read here first (browser refreshed so I can't credit you, sorry!), the antagonist should have been kept more in the shadows, meaning appearing for split microseconds instead of 10 seconds. Seeing her for too long has really diminished her horrifying aura, which I find to be unfortunate. Second, while the ending is pretty realistic given the plot development and is as terrible and discomforting as a Horror ending should be, I couldn't help but feel the film missed the opportunity of a surprising twist (which to me is what makes good Horror great). Amending these two secondary yet significant shortcomings would have made for a solid 10 masterpiece.<br/><br/>All in all, Mama is one of the finest, most impressive and most terrifying Horror films I've ever had the terrible pleasure of watching. While this has only been my subjective opinion and others might find this film disappointing - I'd be committing a crime if I didn't recommend it to anyone and everyone who enjoys the occasional good fright. For a 90 minute Horror film currently available on Netflix it's as rewarding as any Horror fan could hope."

Its always going to be hard to make an original horror movie, however Mama is substantial and consistent throughout. Its a very good modern day horror with a scary mother's worst nightmare theme. After some good building in tension and a few cheap jumpy moments it DOES unfortunately loose its fear factor towards the end but it has a rewarding ending to make up for it.

But alas, 'Mama' never feels wholly original nor clever.

","Spoilers: This is my take on the entire movie. #1 it was not a horror story, but a love story between a mother and child.<br/><br/>This was a wonderful love story about a woman who is declared nuts in the 1870's and has her child taken from her. She returns and kidnaps the child from the authorities and is chased by a pitchfork and torch wielding mob over a cliff. Which is where her haunting begins. The townsfolk, in their evil nefariousness decide to box the baby up and stick it on a shelf for 140 or so years, causing the spirit of the mother not to rest until it is reunited with the child. On the way to the reunion, she discovers the love for another child which she has raised for six years. The father of this child is a homicidal maniac, and is killed when he decides to trespass on Mama's property. Castle Law - bitches! I can't blame the ghost for killing this psychopath, I mean, really, he was unhinged. Well, after raising the two girls for half a dozen years, the uncle's hirelings eventually find them and bring them ""home"" where a self-centered shrink decides to use them for his own experiments under the guise of ""helping them."" Of course this user is only interested in his own ends, and really doesn't care much about the girls. He discovers the remains of Mama's baby and doesn't even tell anyone about it. The Rock Band hot chick is forced to be ""mom"" to the two girls by a combination of guilt and shame, as well as association to the uncle. Meanwhile the aunt is trying to get custody, and eventually ""dirt"" on the ""mom"" so she can steal the girls away from the uncle. What a jerk. She decides that criminal trespass is a good idea, and CASTLE LAW! - Bitches! she is killed by Mama. So far the ghost hasn't done anything unlawful or necessarily even bad. Well, skip to the (near) end where she's trying to get the two young girls to walk over a cliff (because, apparently that's her thing, though she really hasn't been shown to have ever done it before, save her own child when escaping the wild townies mob in the 1800's). The ""mom"" brings her real daughters bones back to her and she is almost satisfied, until the youngest daughter cries out for her - she's the only mama she's ever known, after all. Well, this sets the ghost off, and the uncle and ""mom"" are put in peril. But through pure will force, the ""mom"" saves the older daughter while allowing the ghost to take the younger over the cliff with her (repeating history and destroying the ghost spirit). All in all, a great friendly ghost love story. Enjoy!"

","This is meant in a genuine and not at all malicious way. 'Mama' is not a bad film. It's also (this is all personal opinion, not objective) not a great film. It very nearly was and its potential was enormous, but this is one of the most frustrating recent examples of films of two halves.<br/><br/>'Mama' is absolutely great in the first half. It's genuinely unnerving with a good deal of suspense in the ambiance and build-ups, beautifully timed jolts and spine-tingling scares without resorting to cheap gratuitous gore to make their mark. There are many horror influences here but not in a cheap or predictable way, almost in an affectionate homage sort of way without it meaning to be. The titular character is an ominously creepy presence for most of the film, there is a real sense of danger lurking around the corner at any time. There is something very beautiful and poignant about the story-telling too, underneath the horror was something more than that with at first characters one could connect with and a vulnerable edge that comes over movingly.<br/><br/>On the most part, 'Mama' looks good. It's suitably unsettling but also beautifully shot with creepy and audacious production design and splendidly macabre and sometimes inventive visuals. For the first half of the film, a lot of thought went into the visual effects. The direction from Andy Muschietti shows successful attempts at taking risks rather than over-blowing things or taking it too safe, there is a lot of visual panache and a seeming appreciation for film not just of the horror genre but in general (some of it actually almost thriller-like).<br/><br/>Always look out for a good music score in film, being a musician and growing up in a musical family music is of great importance to me when watching film, television etc. 'Mama' has that, a lot of it is truly haunting while not being over-bearingly used.<br/><br/>Jessica Chastain may not convince as a punk rocker but gives a performance of intensity, steel and vulnerability. Have noticed that both here and in Muschietti's latest film 'IT' that he brings the best out of child-acting, something that has wildly varied in film throughout history. Because 'Mama' is one of the finer recent examples of child acting that is remarkably mature, poised, natural, affecting and sometimes frightening. All of which achieved by Isabelle Nelisse and particularly Megan Charpentier. Daniel Kash makes the most of his problematic nearly pointless plot-device role, while Mama herself is voiced to unnerving effect and even more so in action with Javier Botet.<br/><br/>Which is why it is such a pity that at the midway point 'Mama' feels like a different film altogether with a second half that brings things down. The scares become less frequent, the pace lacks its tautness, the dialogue gets confused and things start becoming predictable and contrived. Due to plot devices not properly followed through, things that don't add up sense-wise and some illogical character decisions.<br/><br/>The less frequent the scares got, Mama also diminished in the scare factor and was almost cartoonish and the effects start to lack finesse. Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau does his best but he is used terribly to the point that he is nearly completely wasted, despite his role in the story being important it's not treated as importantly as ought and fairly indifferently done in execution.<br/><br/>Faring least is the ending, which was unsatisfying on every level as has been said. It is just far too ridiculously outlandish, feels tacked on and it's also very vague in that it leaves questions without fully if at all answering them.<br/><br/>In conclusion, great first half but really disappoints in the second with a slap-in-the-face ending. A small 6/10, was very torn in what to give it having been so disappointed with its unevenness but its good elements and the first half were so well done that being too hard on it was a no-no.

There is a dream sequence showing this which is genuinely disturbing, although in a disgusting snuff-film kind of way.<br/><br/>""Mama,"" predictably, wreaks havoc on everyone involved, including killing several people with more ease than a trained assassin. Call me a parapsychology nerd, but human ghosts generally do not have this kind of power. ""Mama"" slinks around and offs victims like a multi-dimensional Green Beret. This just makes it silly to me.<br/><br/>The ending was just confusing. It's funny, everything about this movie was perfect except for the story.

","Marred by our own familiarity with the genre yet managing to be quite effective when the occasion calls for it, Andrés Muschietti's feature-length adaptation of his short film of the same name is consistent in its delivery of old-school scares, and brilliantly keeps its eerie vibe alive for the major portion of its runtime but what brings it down is its overly sentimental & underwhelming ending.<br/><br/>The story of Mama concerns two young girls who were abandoned in a forest cabin and are found 5 years after their disappearance by a rescue party, that was sponsored by their uncle. Kept under psychiatric care for a while, the two girls prepare their return to domestic life under the custody of their uncle & his girlfriend but the young couple soon finds out that their nieces brought someone else with them.<br/><br/>Co-written & directed by Andrés Muschietti, Mama is crafted with care & affection and sets up its premise with an interesting, if far-fetched, prologue. Muschietti's direction is impressive for a first feature but his inexperience also surfaces, for he has no idea of how to handle the origin story of the ghostly figure we encounter in the story and ends up revealing too much, which in turn takes away the mystery and lessens the overall impact.<br/><br/>But Muschietti does exhibit talent when it comes to creating & sustaining a foreboding atmosphere and expertly carves out some truly chilling segments from time to time. The slow, steady & smooth manoeuvring of camera brings a discomforting element into the story while those sudden bursts of startling immediacy delivers the jump scares. Sound is brilliantly carried out & effectively utilised. Editing could've been better while its background score gives it a fairy tale vibe.<br/><br/>Coming to the acting department, the cast comprises of Jessica Chastain, Nicolaj Coaster-Waldau, Megan Charpentier, Isabelle Nélisse, Daniel Kash & others, with Charpentier & Nélisse stealing the show. Chastain also chips in with a sincere performance, and her chemistry with the two girls is a treat to watch. Both youngsters exhibit a great comfort in each other's company, because of which their relationship feels authentic & highly convincing. Coaster-Waldau doesn't have much to do but does fine with what he's given.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Mama is clichéd, contrived & conventional but it also boasts some genuinely unnerving moments. It isn't difficult to see why Guillermo del Toro endorsed this chiller, for it has a fairy tale quality to it like his own features, is reliant on its ominous ambiance to deliver the scares, brims with rich themes, and chooses practical effects over CGI. Both its title & tagline hinted that emotions will come into play in this feature at some point but that very sentimentality also turns its final act into a bland affair and concludes the film on an unsatisfying note.<br/><br/>In short, Mama is another addition in the long list of horror films that started on a promising note, took a few turns that were simply uncalled for, and wrapped itself up with a climax that failed to deliver the impact its viewers were hoping for."

","I'm happy for those who really loved this film. And it's unfortunate I'm not one of these people, considering I can enjoy movies everyone hates - like House of the Dead (guilty pleasure).<br/><br/>What does Mama succeeds is the story. It starts pretty interesting and the lore caught my attention. Surprising thing is the character development, especially in Annabele (hm, I've remembered most of the character's names - a good sign). The villain looks awesome - it's creepy, the CGI isn't something awful, and Mama has an interesting backstory. The actors give nice performances. Creativity is shown in some moments and concepts.<br/><br/>Despite the positives Mama has its problems. In the first arc Annabel shares too little dialogue and her acts make her kinda unlikable. What really turns me off is that the scenes in darker enviorments are... well, too dark. I'm not sure if the problem is with my TV but following the chases and most moments with Mama gets hard. The film can be a little too boring.<br/><br/>There are plenty of positive things to be said about 2013's Mama but the minuses can't be underestimated. It gets from BAD 1 to EXCELLENT 6 a GOOD 4 and I wish there was 6.5/10 so it'll remain 6/10."

","My favorite part--or theme--of Andres Muschietti's Mama, a fairly standard screecher with more-than-average emotional weight, is watching Jessica Chastain's character get her hard shell chipped off trying to bond with two little girls who have had a 5-year stint in a cabin in the woods with a 130 year old ghost with the maternal instinct of a female grizzly.<br/><br/>As the movie progresses, I found myself falling into an appreciative love with Chastain's Annabel. She's all angry rock bassist tattoos sort of Goth makeup cleavage keep your hands to yourself you piece of crap. And her boyfriend, the girls' uncle, Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, isn't much help because Mama decides it would be a hoot to damn-near kill him in a stair-fall, thereby putting the guardianship on Miss Goth. <br/><br/>Chastain is so angry about having to care for the kiddies--who brought the ghost with them to a university residence (but didn't sign an insurance waiver!)--but when pushed, she starts to channel a little gristliness herself. <br/><br/>I just liked her courage. Even though it's a horror movie, the humanity of Annabel shines through. <br/><br/>What was disappointing was the pat ending, the final fight for the lives and souls of the two girls and the inevitable hint of a sequel. What would have made Mama a complete emotional satisfaction would have had Chastain reasoning with and winning over the ghost, a Spanish actor named Javier Botet (no, I'm not getting bogged down in pronouns, so just read on), and convincing her to accept her loss, believe that God will forgive her sins, and let go.<br/><br/>I know that would have not been anywhere near as intense as the ending in the film, but it would have said something for the power of forgiveness and reason. <br/><br/>Yet, Mama managed to elicit from me what a good scarer should--I had to leave the lights on and cuddle with the chihuahua.<br/><br/>""Dude, let me go!

","""Mama"" was a well-directed film in the thriller/horror style. With Jessica Chastain and the excellent cast, the film was watchable, especially with the interesting camera angles and set-ups of director Andrés Muschietti.<br/><br/>The story focuses on the two young daughters of a businessman, who loses his fortune, goes made, kills his partners and his ex-spouse, then kidnaps the two children. When he drives his car off the road in an isolated mountain area, the man and the children take refuge in a cabin.<br/><br/>It appears as though the father is about to take the lives of his children, but he himself is killed by the supernatural spirit of ""Mama,"" who is the ghost of Edith Brennan, a mental asylum patient from the late 1800s, who escaped from the asylum and killed her child. Her perturbed spirit now takes over the lives of the two little girls and will apparently stop at nothing in killing others to keep them under her control.<br/><br/>While the filmmakers evoked an eerie atmosphere, the film was filled with clichés. ""Mama"" recycles familiar conventions, such as killing anyone who is a threat. Such bystanders as the curious psychiatrist and the overly possessive aunt are de facto targets of elimination. The film's ending was especially disappointing. SPOILER ALERT FOLLOWS: It was most disappointing that the neediest and most vulnerable child, Lily, is the one who is taken away by Mama in perpetuity. How depressing! While the entire cast performed admirably, the material never rose above a standard cinematic foray into the supernatural."

","As all the others Guillermo del Toro's movies i've so far, i really liked this. The ""monsters"" he creates are always super creepy, and even the ""pan's labyrinth"" had a couple super-scary characters, even though it wasn't meant to be a horror (at least, not completely). ""mama"" has a lot of great things, and a few bad things. I loved how mama's appearance is not shown until the half of the movie. I found brilliant the scenes where the girls play with mama, and you only see the girls. Some scenes were simply terrifying: when Annabel see something in a corner and thinks it's lily hiding under a blanket, but then she hears the girls downstairs; when Victoria looks at something really tall behind the doctor during the interrogatory; when the hunters find the girls in the old house; when Annabel is about to open the closet in the girls room; and many others. All those scenes sends shivers down my spine when thinking about them, and that's what makes the movie great. I would give it a strong 9, but i lowered to 8 because the final scene could have been handled better and also because some scenes had a couple clichés i didn't like (everyone is going around at night, alone, every time. Why would the doctor be so stupid, since he knows what's hiding there?<br/><br/>Apart from those minor things i didn't like, i really enjoyed the movie, and i think it's strongly underrated (mostly because i've seen the same rating on way worse horror movies.)"

","I just got back from seeing it and these are my impressions. I prefer going to the theatres for horror movies, mainly because some of the scare tactics work on the big screen, I can't say the same for watching it at home. The movie had a Strong momentum through out, but at the end it loses it's drive. Once you see mama in full view, it is no longer scary, hell Lily was scarier than mama most of the time. Now I do not like cgi monsters, I was fine with the cgi up until they have her standing in front of the camera for long sections. If you were scarred throughout, don't worry, after the ending I guarantee you won't lose any sleep, I know I won't. The plot with the doctor was good, but it ended up serving little purpose. The kids did a good job, and they look especially creepy when they are crawling around like animals. There was some good suspense and plenty of jump scares to keep you tense. I wonder if the film would have benefited from having a real actress playing mama instead of the computer, I would have liked to have seen that. This is one of those films were the trailer was better than the film, I'm not saying the movie was bad, it's just that the trailer made it look like so much more. The only part I didn't enjoy about this experience was the two obnoxious bimbos' beside me, they were in their late twenties and were acting like 16 year old kids, that's why I like going to the theatre at 11:00am on a Saturday morning, no one to annoy me. Overall the film is a good waste of an hour and forty minutes, check it out if you are interested."

","***EXTREME SPOILER ALERT...ENDING REVEALED****<br/><br/>I WARNED YOU!!!!<br/><br/>OK, if you are a pedophile who likes to see little girls dressed mostly in pajamas for about 90% of the film, then you won't be disappointed...BUT..if you are a horror fan...I, like many others, felt cheated, as this could have been a great film.. I won't repeat the plot..read the other reviews, I will just tell you why this movie misses the mark. As others said, this was developed from a short film and it shows... After the creepiness factor and BOO scares are out of the way (and I will admit here that the kids, esp. in the beginning were very creepy) it really is a very simple and thin story line. Like Pans Labyrinth (a vastly superior film) the plot teeters on the edge of a horror film and a fairy tale (albeit. a Grimm style tale) not quite knowing which to be.<br/><br/>Even though horror films are fantasies, I like at least a modicum of believability in the story line, of course within the genre. (a very good example of a pure ""ghost story"" would be the 1970's film ""Ghost Story"" with Fred Astaire and a big name cast) First, there is a very sketchy background story, which at least I don't know what the director was trying to say. Was the mad lady who took the baby (eventually becoming the ghost/monster) the REAL mother, or did she just snatch any old baby from the nun's hands? Was the mad woman even a ghost at all? At times she seemed more a Earth spirit than a ghost, and HOW did she become this way? The psychologist seemed to know, but HIS AH HAH moment is not ours to know. He vaguely refers to the sign outside the cabin, but we never know what it means...(another reviewer said it meant Switzerland...SO...??)<br/><br/>Also, the entity called Mama was much scarier when in the shadows..once revealed...it was pathetic.. <br/><br/>FILM MAKERS TAKE NOTE..the truly great horror films leave much to the imagination which is far scarier..the unseen is always better than the seen. Example. The best ""ghost story"" on film IMOP was the 60's film ""The Haunting"" with Julie Harris...you never see ANYTHING but that movie was one of the best films in it's genre of all time!! Again, what was Mama? A ghost, a creature from another dimension, a elemental spirit??? We just never know, nor do we find out WHY after jumping off a cliff with her ""baby"" she morphs into an unworldly creature. Even some H.P. Lovecraft mumbo-jumbo would been better than no explanation at all. and the cricket chirping sounds...It seems that after Mimic, every creature sounds like a cockroach or cricket...<br/><br/>Finally the ending.....<br/><br/>SPOILERS<br/><br/>Why is Guillermo del Toro fascinated by killing children in the end of his films? For the shock value? Of course the ends of both Pan's Labyrinth and this film are a bit vague, but at least as mortal beings both girls died...so what if it was a ""compromise...Mama takes lily because she still clings to ""Mama"" and the ethereal world, while Victoria being older, is released to the care of the living in our world...<br/><br/>OK children dying in the end is at least not a cop-out, but it doesn't raise the caliber of this film enough to say...yeah..go see it!"

Yahoo!<br/><br/>I wish these main stream horror directors would just say screw you to being scary and actually try to tell a good story. But no, we got to add more run of the mill jump scares to this sucker.<br/><br/>Also, a scene rips off the game Fatal Frame. <br/><br/>There is also a lot of plot holes. The ghost for example is clearly a good one at the start of the film. It protected and cared for the two kids for five years straight and it killed one guy, a man that was about to kill them. Not actually evil there. But then she goes evil because...? Well the film suggests that she's jealous of the new parents. But if that's the case, why does she wait so long to strike? Her power seems endless at the end of the film. It would of been nice if she had a motive because you can't simply say she's evil due to her literally saving the kids lives. Oh, and did I mention she spends most of the film trying to find her lost baby only to destroy the things bones? Why? Beats me. It's just random.<br/><br/>The Annabel character also makes no sense. Yes, I get it, she doesn't want to be a mother, but why does she have to act so distant and mean towards the kids? Just cause you don't want to be a mother doesn't mean you should randomly act like a dick towards some kids you just met. She has no reason to act this way. Sure, she comes to care for them by the end(for unclear reasons) but by then I, the viewer, already see her as a dick.<br/><br/>There are only two good things about this. Isabelle Nélisse acting was very impressive with how she moved and acted like an animal. It was so off, but interesting. And the dream scene, which is wonderfully over stylized.<br/><br/>This could have been so, SO much better as the idea of two kids being raised in the wild and then having to live a normal life can be made into such an interesting story. Read The Room to see what can be done with an idea like this. Instead, screw that original and thought provoking idea, let's slap some random scary ghost in it! BOO!<br/><br/>3 out of 10.

Quite frankly, ''Mama'' looked more like something you would mop your floor with rather than anything else. The ending was very unlikely and sentimental. The official trailer - which made me decide to visit the premiere of this film in the first place - was extremely deceptive.

"sandiglendinning","5","2","5","9 June 2013"," A flat tyre of a movie on the highway of bleh!
","Mama is a drama movie, masquerading as a horror movie. The problem with this is, that it has been marketed as a horror movie and horror fans rightly expect horror. What is presented instead is more of an attempt at psychological drama with a few jump scares stirred into the mix. <br/><br/>Mama tells the story of two little girls who have through a series of tragic events been raised as feral children in the mysterious wilds by an entity which they refer to only as Mama. Through another inexplicable series of events the girls come to live with their uncle and aunt, whom has no maternal urges whatsoever. As the story progresses it becomes evident that Mama may not simply be an imaginary friend. <br/><br/>As a psychologist, I found lots and lots wrong with this film. The psychologists in the film, do not speak or behave like psychologists or researchers would, they do not use the parlance of scientists and are unconvincing characters. As a rule, if you are going to include expert characters in your movie, you should at the very least do your research in order to make these characters plausible. The fact that the expert characters in this film come across as unconvincing detracts from the power of the story heavily. In works of fiction it's not always important that information should be factually accurate, it is important that it is convincing however and Mama fails on this count.<br/><br/>To be fair, the youngest child does in some accurate way display some of the developmental deficits that would be expected in a feral child, but only lip service is paid to this as a plot device. It may have been more interesting to elaborate on that particular theme.<br/><br/>Jessica Chastain is woefully miscast in this film, as a primary character she is entirely unconvincing as a emo rock chick. Snarling and huffing her way though the early stages of the movie in a horrendously laughable wig, she miraculously transforms into a tiger mother practically overnight. I understand that she is a fine actress, and I'm sure she is tired of being typecast but taking on this role has done absolutely nothing to assist her. Her attempt at being a scream queen has effectively crashed and burned right here. <br/><br/>The narrative of this film is somewhat tedious, there is unnecessary padding and emphasis on the emotional which is not given any proper context or explanation. Just when the viewer comes to accept that Mama is a psychological drama some supernatural elements are crudely dumped into the plot. The result is neither something or nothing, what could have been a compelling psychological thriller is transformed into a poor attempt at a horror movie. <br/><br/>As a horror film, Mama isn't scary or even remotely chilling and there are no surprises between the plot holes. it is very difficult to build a rapport with the characters as they are unconvincing eye candy and there is not enough of a coherent back story to encourage the viewer to care about their lives. <br/><br/>Honestly there is nothing offensive about Mama, but there is nothing particularly memorable about it either. It is about as average and boring as a film can be which is always a disappointment.<br/><br/>In short- Fellow horror fans, stay away and give this one a wide berth, it isn't horror. Horror fan to horror fan take my word for it this is a mainstream attempt at the genre, an internet meme of a movie and a waste of your time.<br/><br/>Everyone else- If you are a massive chicken or a small child you might find this scary.

","I watched this movie in broad daylight, but I can say that my rating has nothing to do with the possible effects that occur on your prospection when watching a horror title late in the night.First notion/it is not a realistic story,even though the movie itself is presented that way to the audience at the start,very soon it boils down to something like a five year old nightmare or seven year old,I don't care.The most prominent characteristic of this title is its numerous copy-paste elements summoned from others titles of similar content,like for example:the archivist lady ala Halloween with a haunted story of ancient times, which always finds a way to connect with the main story that involves our characters.The main male character stuck in a hospital due to unexplained attack by strange powers,abandoned cabin in the woods very relevant,little girl eating bugs and creepy crawlies and such.<br/><br/>But let's turn to Mama,our biggest attraction here,who at first by the way looks decent by the standards of a horror fan to be turned into a fantasy animation very del Toro style,but somehow seems not to belong here. And then there are some touching scenes of sister separation that won't make your heart ache. By the end of the movie you'll wish you've had a power failure or some worse trouble that got you off your chair before this disaster ended. And now to explain why I gave it 4 and not 1 star,so here are some benefits: <br/><br/>1)If you are a child and planning to watch this or haven't seen but a few horror titles go ahead and do it,but stop right there if you are a cynical type or a lion's heart dude <br/><br/>2)If you have been waiting for a decent torrent,so you don't have any regrets later<br/><br/>3)there is no third,basically you have f*cked up 2 hours,bit still watch because I didn't want to write this review for nothing.<br/><br/>*the lion's heart notion just pooped up from nowhere,sorry"

Throwing in un-necessarily lame dream sequences, plenty off major plot holes, and a good handful of ""its behind you but your not noticing it for some reason!"" moments. Plus, the human characters intelligence seems to go off the rails, in a part two that doesn't think it needs to explain anything that's going on, because it got its chat out off the way in the first half.<br/><br/>There are more than enough scary moments In ""mama,"" but just as many desperate attempts too freak us out (moths, goofy CGI) plenty of random moments just thrown in too kill time, some bits that make no sense whatsoever, and parts that just don't work at all."
"s_campanale","9","2","5","3 March 2013"," Spirit raised by Girls raised by spirit punks punky Chastain in creepy custody battle from Hell!
","Mexican director Guliermo Del Toro is increasingly going the way of Tarantino and Besson, taking promising young talents under his wing and nurturing them into a stable of likeminded auteurs. This is one such project, directed by unknown Andres Muschietti based on his 5 minute short of the same name.<br/><br/>The film, from its trailer and marketing, appears to be yet another in the endless production line of ""Look behind you-family in peril from unseen things and sinister shadows-fade to black shock 'What are you? What do you want?-scary noises"" identikit horrors, but it is actually refreshingly far from the usual cookie cutter mould.<br/><br/>Inspired by the cold, cerebral Horror-Sci-fi of the 1970s (""Silent Running"" gets a notable name drop) and blended with the more modern strain of tragic ghost stories from Japan, Korea and of course Del Toro himself, the film has a very interesting premise, and even more unusual execution.<br/><br/>Starting with a story ripped from our own headlines, we follow a desperate father, bankrupted in the 2008 crash, killing his associates and wife, before taking his 2 infant daughters to die with him in a suicide murder. But taking refuge in the woods, these victims of modern tragedy encounter the ghostly victim of an earlier one, Edith Eames, a Victorian Downs Syndrome sufferer who gave birth in an asylum (we can imagine how she got pregnant..) but wouldn't give up her baby and ran off with it, jumping to her death off a high cliff pursued by locals. Though looking rather ghastly (apart from her condition she is also broken and bent by the fall and rotted by the river water) and having a very scary way of moving, including going through walls and floors, Edith is no villain and takes care of the two girls, raising them as her own as best she can, until they are found 5 years later by their uncle, comic book artist Lucas (Nicolaj Coaster-Waldau) and his punk rocker girlfriend Annabel (an unrecognisable ""Gothed up"" Jessica Chastain) and taken into their custody. Feral, wild, barely able to speak, and in constant communion with Edith, who they have simply taken to calling ""Mama"", they excite the interest of psychiatrist Dr Dreyfuss (Daniel Kash as a typical cold hearted, untrustworthy, science before human beings 1970s horror shrink) Dreyfuss puts the skid row pair in a fancy mansion to study the kids dynamic, but quickly realises there are parapsychological forces at play, and tracks Edith's history and past down. With Edith becoming increasingly angry and jealous at the interlopers, it soon becomes a custody battle from Hell, with the two girls, Victoria and Lilly, increasingly divided in loyalty. Victoria, the older one who remembers her past life, gravitates towards Annabelle and a return to normality, but younger Lilly, who has only ever known Edith, sticks strongly to her ghostly adopted mother no matter what.<br/><br/>The ""monster"" Edith/Mama is, as you might gather, rather more sympathetic than the usual angry spirits of the genre. Although horrific, and capable of murder (though in defence of her adopted children, and only killing unpleasant characters) she is motivated by love and the need to love, a need she was denied 140 years before. She is a sort of amalgam of ""The Woman in Black"", the protective ghost of Irena in ""Curse of the Cat People"" and Tim Burton's ""Corpse Bride"". She provides plenty of scares, usually popping up in corners or behind doors just in the angle of the frame for that ""shudder"" effect, and is well rendered and delivers the nightmare chills we expect, but to their credit Muschietti and Del Toro give her the pathos and understanding such a character deserves. This is especially true of the films controversial and much derided ending. Rather than concluding everything with violence and Sturm und Drang, they follow through the story that has preceded it and give us a resolution that is apt and lyrically poetic, (similar in many ways to the endings of ""The Corpse Bride"" and ""The Matrix"" trilogy) which is more likely to jerk tears than raise hairs. The die-hard Horror fans may naturally feel short changed, but it is a beautiful and moving final note, showing the film's Latin origins over the usual blood and guts practicality of the Anglo tradition.<br/><br/>Acting wise, the ever rising Jessica Chastain excels once again, barely recognisable in her punky Goth get up, but beneath the cliché rock band chick is a beating human being, one who responds to the situation thrust upon her as best she can. Again, whereas an Anglo-American film would thrust Annabelle's new found maternal position down our throats with the old disingenuous ""a woman's true happiness"" line, here she grows to love the girls through simply being with them, without ever becoming ""a mom"". She sympathises with Edith's plight, and does not try to make herself out to be ""the better mother"". As her boyfriend Lucas (and his homicidal twin from the intro) ""Game of Thrones"" hunk Waldau gives a balanced and natural persona, someone who like Annabelle is trying to make the best of a bad situation. Kush is also good as the 1970s style sinister man of science, though he too remains sympathetic despite his generic role.<br/><br/>All in all ""Mama"" delivers more than the trailers promise, with solid acting, a nice retro style, real chills and horrible thrills, an original storyline and a pathos filled, lyrical sadness that elevates it to a higher artistic plain. Just remember to bring some handkerchiefs for the finale!"
"samuel_legassick","4","2","5","27 February 2013"," Mama - More Horrific Than Horror
","Read full review here: http://www.thewildbore.com/2013/02/review-mama/<br/><br/>Del Toro seems to be doing this a lot lately. He seems obsessed with sticking his name to horror films with kids as the central focus. It's a strange hobby for him to take up seeing as his film Pan's Labyrinth eclipses all of them, but yet he clearly sees the passion in these directors and puts his own name, credibility and money behind them. It's an honourable thing to do by allowing the next generation to get a crowbar into an industry that only takes on it's own. However, it can be argued as a strange exploitation. After all, can you name the director of Mama? It's Andres Muschietti but you won't see his name splattered all over the adverts. It brings to mind the whole Poltergeist thing in 1982 when Spielberg's name was all over the film and poor old Tobe Hooper kicked up a fuss about it (and rightly so). Though Spielberg had taken over the set apparently. Bloody Spielberg. But this is besides the point<br/><br/>Muschietti had made a wonderful short of the same name in 2008 and Del Toro loved it so much that he gave him the opportunity to turn it into a full feature. It's a shame because it should have stayed a short and definitely had more of an impact in 3 minutes than it did in 90.<br/><br/>That isn't to say it's a bad film. In fact, it starts with much promise. Two young girls have had a rather strange upbringing and their special protector is Mama, someone we see in the shadows but that becomes more prominent as the film continues. Jessica Chastain plays a rock chick having to turn mother with a very patient and supremely talented Nikolaj Coaster- Waldau as the uncle with a heart. The pairing of these two is a great heavyweight combo of new talent but unfortunately it's wasted here. The same goes with the little girls who actually do a very good job and show a lot of promise.<br/><br/>The problem lies with the fact that this film is just a sequence of set-pieces, none of which are really scary but more 'jumpy' and at times laughable. Mama herself is given a backstory (do I care?), characters seem to do the craziest things (why does everyone keep going to the cabin at night? or wandering around lost?), Mama isn't really scary (is she giving people a hicky?) and so CG it hurts (if I see it, it isn't scary). There are a couple of good bits but it's not shocking and definitely won't make you scared of bumps in the night. The dialogue is clunky and the pace quite slow with an idea clearly trying to be fleshed out into a story that just doesn't work.<br/><br/>Even if you take into account the metaphor of Mama being Chastain's embodiment of her fear of motherhood, the ending just doesn't make sense. In fact, it might be one of the worst endings I've seen in a horror for a while. It's supposed to be a beautiful, elegant ending but instead is irritable and stupid to say the least. The fact that it's so jumpy also means that it takes the value out of watching it again, which I might do on a Friday night with nothing to do, but wouldn't go out of my way for.<br/><br/>I have to say it's better than Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark, which isn't hard to do but not nearly as good as The Orphanage. I was very excited about seeing this and I should have known better, horror is just getting worse and worse and not in a good way."
"toqtaqiya2","6","2","5","31 January 2013"," An impressive debut by Andres Muschietti. It's a spooky and intelligent horror film.
","Mama is the best horror film I've seen in a while. It works thanks to the efforts of director and ambitious newcomer Andres Muschietti. Another reason why the film works is because it was produced by the visionary Guillermo del Toro. Barbara Muschietti, the director's sister, was also a producer. The scares here are a product of the mother's attachment to the children, and this theme works well in the context of the film. The mother in question is certainly a frightening creation. While there are jump scares the majority of the horror involves tension and mystery. This makes Mama seem similar to Gore Verbinski's The Ring (2002). The cinematography of The Ring is dominated by the colors blue and green. Antonio Riestra's beautiful cinematography for Mama is dominated by brown and black. All this makes the film an interesting chiller, and I enjoyed the atmosphere as much as I enjoyed the story. In the end though it's not easy to feel sympathy for the mother. Some scenes show to the audience that she's a sympathetic character, but she's still too scary and her acts too gruesome to make her really sympathetic. Another quirk is that the acting isn't always suitable, so even critics' darling Jessica Chastain doesn't always deliver with Muschietti's direction. One of the influences on Mama was obviously the Japanese horror genre. The best releases from that genre ended before the mid-2000s, but Mama shows that elements from it can still be effective. All in all it's an engaging horror film, and I recommend seeing it."

It is creepy/jump-scene scary as opposed to blood and violence. As for story line, some may disagree with me and say this film has no ""story"" but I think it does. True, some details are vague, but I believe deliberately so. Also, some parts were explained very subtly if you pay attention. I think it stands out against some similar movies due to the character development plus the unique main plot.

","I was troubled by some of the reviews on IMDb and posts on the message board. This film was excellent, yet its overall meaning seems to be (in my opinion) misunderstood by many. The overall theme of this film was an intricate conglomerate of deep love, mortality, and redemption accomplished through a sharp contrast of life and death. Without delving deeper into the underlying layers of the film, it is easy to see our antagonist ghoul as nothing more than a cliché horror spawn of evil meant to terrorize the characters throughout the unfolding of events. I claim that the film is much more than this, and its brilliance deserves to be brought to light. I am a computer engineering/mathematics major and make no claim to be an expert in the area of art and film.

","The Guillermo del Toro produced ""Mama"" is an overwhelmingly creepy film, rich in fine acting and startling visuals. It tells the tale of two young girls who, after having lived alone in the woods for five years, are rescued by a young couple. What was keeping them alive? We soon find out, as a very protective ghostly Mama reveals herself at the family's house, and quickly begins trying to take ""her"" girls back where they belong. This is a solid ghost story, atmospheric and frightening, but softened by an overuse of unnecessary CGI and far too many cliché genre inclusions. But the amazing performances, especially those of the two young girls, summon this thriller back from the dead and into the realm of Good Movies.<br/><br/>-Thomas Bond"
"majorpackerfan","7","2","5","23 January 2013"," New director, old ideas
","Mama can be compared to the American horror movie ""the ring"". In its long static shots of suspense and excitement. But it does not deliver the same suspense that the ring created with the little girl. I myself am afraid of scary little girls more than scary little ... mamas.<br/><br/>It opens on a scene of the father of these little girls taking them from their home saying ""mommy is not feeling well and we gotta go."" Driving through the snow at a very high speed. The father seems easily agitated and scared. <br/><br/>Driving way to fast he falls off the road and his car hits a tree. Somehow he and both his little girls survive and they are walking in the woods alone until they see a cabin in these woods. <br/><br/>Something is wrong. He has a gun pointed to the little girls head about to shoot. Something comes out of the darkness and takes the father. It stops. We then see the fathers brother and his girl friend. <br/><br/>The uncle of these girls wants to find them. He has hired people to find them. When they finally find them they are in bad shape. The girls crawling on all 4's inside the same cabin seems a tad bit silly and you almost want to laugh instead of feel scared. <br/><br/>It then kicks off what is about to come with Mama and the little girls. <br/><br/>The movie will take you on a suspenseful ride wondering what is next. Very similar to the ring in which once you finally find out what this thing is it loses all its scary appeal. At that point the movie breaks down and by the end you are wondering why didn't you just wait til DVD.<br/><br/>Mama will provide some good scares. They are not cheap and are well displayed on camera. Like most movies in this genre once they show what the thing is everything that was once scary loses its once freaky appeal. <br/><br/>2.5/4"
"jaguiar313","6","3","11","18 January 2013"," Supernatural thriller isn't bad but, needs more scares and less CGI.
","Mama isn't a bad horror film but, it just isn't a very scary one. The story is good, two little girls are taken by their off-the-edge dad (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) who's just shot their mother and some co-workers. They crash off the road during dad's escape attempt and wind up in a decrepit old cabin in the woods. One that possibly has an otherworldly occupant. A few years later, they are found alive, somehow having survived and these now feral children are given over to their dad's twin brother Lucas (also Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) and his rocker wife, Annabel (Jessica Chastain). But, the girl's don't seem to have come alone and whatever has followed them isn't happy about sharing them. The problems with Mama aren't from it's story, it's that despite giving the film a nicely spooky visual style, director Andres Muschietti doesn't build much tension, suspense or scares. There are a few creepy sequences and some well executed jump scares but, the biggest problem is that ""Mama"" is revealed far too early and it is an obvious CGI specter that is simply not scary. Even when an accident leaves Annabel alone for a while with the girls and their adoptive spook, there is little suspense as Annabel tries to figure out why strange things are happening . It is very well done as Annabel goes from selfish bitch to someone who really cares about the girls and want's to solve the mystery of who ""Mama"" is but, it's never scary or carries much tension or suspense. Then, the final act switches gears and we go from a horror film to a Gothic fairy tale ending. I don't think the change in tone quite worked. Ironically I liked the last act very much but, not attached to the rest of the movie. The cast are all good here with Chastain standing out as the bass player wife and reluctant overnight mom. She comes across as a bitch early on but, believably transforms the character into a woman who comes to care about her nieces and is willing to put herself at risk to fight for them. The girls are wonderful too, Megan Charpentier as the older Victoria who starts to see ""Mama"" for the dangerous entity she is and Isabelle Nelisse as the younger Lilly who still is very attached to ""Mama"" and sees her as a friend and maternal figure. The script is good, it just seems director Muschietti didn't quite know how to give it the edge it needs and the switch in tone for the last act is a bit jarring. Overall Mama is not a bad supernatural thriller and there is a lot to like about it but, it just doesn't quite effectively give the material the strength it needed to keep us riveted or peeking through our fingers which is what a film like this is supposed to do."

Cliché scares.(Literally going as old school as the lights in the bathroom turning off, then they come back on and something is in the mirror) No logical answers at all to the ending. No build up or on-edge seat suspense at ALL in this movie, besides the cheap scares, to the point where the only reason it scared you was because you were expecting it. Characters are so hollow, they really didn't put much effort into making anyone in the movie memorable. Not even the Uncle, he was just the guy who found stuff out at the last minute. Oh yeah, that happens too. And no, it isn't done well. People not turning lights on in a house in the middle of woods late at night. People going in alone to a abandoned cabin late at night, just classic stupid stuff we hate. No depth or real answers for the beginning of the movie, usually they at least explain in detail why something tragic happens in the start of a movie.

"Coventry","6","1","2","15 October 2015"," Mama! I don't want to die I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all!
","Typical movies like ""Mama"", by which I mean PG-13 ghost movies with computerized shock-effects, definitely aren't my thing but I will admit straight away that I cherish some respect and appreciation for this particular movie. ""Mama"" is fundamentally a very clichéd and ordinary flick about a fiendish supernatural entity, but writer/director Andrés Muschietti single-handedly brings it to a higher level thanks to processing realistic main characters and socially relevant themes into his screenplay. I was particularly impressed by the opening sequences that so unscrupulously deal with family tragedy. A clearly desperate middle-aged father reportedly killed three people already, including his ex-wife, and drags his two young daughters to a secluded cabin in the woods where he sees no other alternative than to kill them and himself as well. We regretfully see a lot of tragic news facts like this one on TV, but for some reason they still remain taboo in movie scenarios. The supernatural aspect kicks in when the father is prevented to fulfill his vile act of desperation by a ghostly long black-haired entity. The plot then subsequently introduces two other identifiable main characters, namely the girls' uncle Lucas who's overpowered by feelings of guilt and responsibility and his rock artist girlfriend Annabel who supports her man but is actually reluctant to take the girls into custody. Annabel even becomes the lead guardian when Lucas gets severely injured in a bizarrely inflicted accident. The rest of the film is familiar ghost-movie stuff, meaning predictable plot-twists, a too large portion of sentiment and an avalanche of textbook ""boo!"" situations. For you see, throughout a long 5 year period, the poor little sisters survived in that little cabin in the woods because they were being looked after by the restless spirit of a mother who got murdered in that same location many years ago. When the uncle finds and ""rescues"" the estranged girls, the Mama-ghost turns malevolent and follows them to the civilized world. The Mama figure, with its long weaving dark hair and bizarrely produced sounds, is very reminiscent to the ghosts introduced in popular Japanese blockbusters, like ""Ringu"" and ""Ju-On: The Grudge"", and the film makes the typical mistake of showing it too much and too frequently. In this type of scary flicks, the less you see of the evil, the more menacing it is. Jessica Chastain gives a stellar performance and a handful of scenes are definitely unsettling. Andrés Muschietti initially released ""Mama"" as a short film, but thanks to the interest of certain influential producers like Guillermo Del Toro, it became a large-budgeted and internationally acclaimed long-feature horror hit as well. I read that his next project will be an upcoming remake of ""It"" What is it with promising young directors immediately blocking their creativity by making redundant remakes?!?"

","As specter/ghost movies go, Mama has entered a crowded market. How Mama would separate itself and make a scary movie unlike the others was the question. Or maybe Mama wouldn't even go the scary route.<br/><br/>The title is very benign and unrevealing. Even the way the movie starts with the childlike scrolling of ""Once upon a time,"" lent towards a potentially light and jocular movie. Is the title related to the movie? Yes. The movie is about two very young girls that lost their parents and were subsequently raised by a ghost whom they called ""Mama"". Initially, like most ghost movies of this ilk, you don't know if the apparition is benevolent or malevolent. I mean, you could say it was benevolent simply because it took the time to raise these two orphans. At the same time you could say it was malevolent because it didn't bother to lead very capable flesh and blood people to these girls to raise them properly. In any case, it is a scary movie so you can watch to judge the spirit for yourself.<br/><br/>As the movie goes, it was not too original and there were many flaws to it. Some of the flaws could be overlooked but then other flaws actually hampered the story. There were the occasional startling moments to keep the audience on its toes. The movie borrowed from The Ring and The Grudge as far as the new way ghosts get around: I mean the crab walk. Likewise, the movie borrowed from so many others in keeping the ghost hidden for the first half of the movie for maximum scare effect later on.<br/><br/>Like I said, nothing original, minimum startle factor and a ho-hum ending."
"Hey_Sweden","6","1","2","16 October 2014"," Flawed but compelling.
","Guillermo del Toro presents and executive produces this decent psychological horror film, expanded from a three minute short by its co-writer / director Andres Muschietti. Muschietti manages to create a somber and creepy mood throughout. He's crafted a fairly touching story, and he gets very fine performances out of both his adult and child actors. The atmosphere is excellent at times, but what really works against his efforts is the overload of visual effects. They really help to kill the mystery. Also, some genre fans are likely to be less than pleased with Muschietti opting to go for the jump scare as often as he does. The result is a mildly entertaining horror film that falls short of its full potential.<br/><br/>The versatile Jessica Chastain is solid as a rocker chick named Annabel - she plays bass - who's involved with Lucas (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau). Lucas is uncle to two adorable little girls, who were taken into the wilderness by their unhinged father (also played by Coaster-Waldau). Dad has already committed a few murders and looks like he will add his daughters to the list before *something* snatches him. Five years later, the girls are finally found, and having lived in the country for so long, have become quite feral. With the help of a dedicated psychiatrist, Dr. Dreyfuss (Daniel Kash), they become somewhat readjusted to normal life. However, Annabel becomes convinced that some sort of presence has returned with the girls, who claim to have been acquainted with a character whom they merely dub Mama.<br/><br/>Some viewers feel that for whatever Muschietti is able to accomplish, he blows it with that finale, which admittedly disregards anything resembling subtlety. Still, there is an emotional centre to this film that makes it hard to completely dislike. The director really goes for broke with his imagery, using moths as a motif. Coaster-Waldau is likable as the uncle, who does some sleuthing, as does the good doctor. (It is nice to see Kash, who played Spunkmeyer in ""Aliens"" 28 years ago, in a major supporting such as this.) Megan Charpentier as Victoria and Isabelle Nelisse as Lilly are both appealing in the child roles.<br/><br/>""Mama"" isn't exempt from trappings of the genre film, such as questionable character decisions, but all in all it's a reasonably affecting experience.<br/><br/>Six out of 10."

","This is one of the best suspense films I've seen in a very long time! It kept me engaged throughout the entire movie! That's saying a lot for me, as I almost never simply sit and just watch a movie. I'm usually doing a dozen other things! This is by no means a carbon copy of the standard ghost stories! I am very impressed with how well the writers, producers and director emphasized the fact that you do not have to be related by blood in order to be a family. Not to mention the extent that one is willing to go through in order to protect those they love. <br/><br/>Regardless of your own opinion of this movie... ask yourself honestly, how far would you be willing to go in order to protect those who are most important in your life!?"
"peterp-450-298716","7","1","2","1 April 2014"," A frightening movie with a very intense atmosphere
","""Daddy,look! There's a woman outside the window.And she's not touching the floor."" <br/><br/>""Mama"" has all the elements to make it a great, creepy horror movie. It starts very strong with a somewhat hazy situation with a desperate father who killed his wife and abducts his children to an unknown destination. I suppose it's a family tragedy in the making caused by an economic crisis. However, the plan to kill the two sisters Victoria and Lilly goes awry after an accident in which they end up in a remote cabin in the woods. Here, the father ultimately can't carry out his act of desperation by the intervention of a blurred (as seen through the eyes of Victoria who is visually impaired) being who appears to be ""Mama"" afterwards .<br/><br/>What follows is for me one of the most impressive forbearing scenes of this movie, namely when the two girls are found after 5 years. The image of the two swinging, smeared with mud, humming sisters on the refrigerator where they moved to with high speed in an arachnid way. Succeeded by the images in the psychiatric institution where the sisters are in observation and where it's shown how they have evolved into the skittish underdeveloped beings through their prolonged isolation. The moment when Victoria suddenly appears in the viewing window is an impetus for similar horror elements and it made ​​me think of Samara from ""The Ring"".<br/><br/>When Luke, the brother of the missing father who has custody of the two sisters, moves into a house, which is offered by the institution where the accompanying psychiatrist works, together with Annabel his girlfriend, it appears that something else has nested itself there too. Luke ends up in the hospital because of ""Mama"", so Annabel is all alone to take care of the two sisters and that's when the trouble starts.<br/><br/>The story on its own has been told countless times in other haunted-house movies. Although it is not really a haunted-house movie in the purest sense of the word. A bundle of clichés from other horror movies pass in review including the soundtrack. OK, it's cheap but I have to admit that most horror movies depend on it, and without it, it seems rather that you have seen a fairy tale instead of an unnerving horror/scary movie. In other words, it has to be like this.<br/><br/>The acting of the two girls was a top performance. Especially Lilly looked sometimes terrifying and demonic. Suddenly emerging from the darkness with the expressionless gaze and then disappearing lightning fast while giggling. She was also the only one of the pair who unconditionally accepted ""Mama"" as her natural mother and couldn't or wouldn't say goodbye to this entity. Victoria wasn't such a strong and convincing person, but that was more in line with the character. She quickly made ​​the transition to the more human world and accepted Lucas and Annabel as surrogate parents. That's why she rejected the request of Lilly to go outside and play with ""Mama"". Lucas quickly disappeared out of the picture, and therefore played a minor role. Annabel on the other other hand was also a strong interpretation. An alternative rock chick, with absolutely no maternal instinct (I thought she was pleased that the pregnancy test was negative in the beginning of the movie). She evolves into a mother figure after a while who really cares about the sisters.<br/><br/>But the strongest character turned out to be the creature ""Mama"". I read here and there about the bad CGI or irritating SFX, but I haven't noticed any of this.. I found it a compelling and terrifying spectacle. To my surprise I saw the name Javier Botet between the other actors on IMDb. The interpreter of ""Mama"" ... duhuh .... This person was told at the age of 5 that he's suffering from the symptoms of Marfan. A deviation that causes a person to grow to an unusual height with long, skinny arms,legs and fingers. He has this natural anomaly used to play personages like ""Mama"" and ""Medeiros"" in the ""REC"" movies. The CGI is subsequently projected on it. This gave the figure ""Mama"" a more realistic figure. The only laughable thing was the wig shuffling over the floor. They could have worked that out in a different way.<br/><br/>Eventually I thought it was a frightening movie with a very intense atmosphere and properly placed scare moment (and I'm not easily scared). Again this shows that a good horror doesn't always require the necessary gore elements to make it oppressive. Personally I thought the end was a bit far-fetched with a baby corpse kept in an archive and the in a huge swarm of moths bursting cocoon. Just like in ""The Woman in Black"" the found remedy doesn't eliminate the curse.<br/><br/>More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be/"

Many people loved the innovation and others hated, because it's really different than that regular ends most horror movies have. This is one of the few movies in which the girls can talk directly with the ghost, and interact as if it was a normal person, and, at the same time, mama is a regular ghost for who tries to separate she and her girls. <br/><br/>The cast act really well, you can feel truth in what they are saying and doing. Their fear are visible. <br/><br/>This movie has a great direction, you can feel the tension in each scene. The photography is beautiful in horror, it's realistic in a sort of a way. These two aspects contribute to create fear in who's watching. This is one of the bests horror movies I've seen in 2013, the story has unexpected ways of going. It tells the story of the girls, but at the same time, it show us the history of the ghost, and how it mixed itself with those two girls, but even in a moment we can imagine how it's gonna end. At list, I couldn't guess what happened. <br/><br/>Tagline: a mother's love is forever<br/><br/>Did you knew?<br/><br/>Mama is based in a short movie, with 8 minutes of duration, with the same story and produced by the same person."

","I loved this movie. It is creepy and emotional! Had me off my seat a lot and had me in tears for sure. Also had me upset at times. Like I said this is an amazing movie. All the emotions I love to experience. As a mother myself I was really sad for those girls and very excited but yet worried about the uncle taking over. I was so sad for the mother and the baby but why did she have to take the little girl, that just killed me there. The counselor was stupid for going into the cabin by himself for sure. I saw the oldest was trying to have a relationship with her uncle's girlfriend and the youngest almost was there until the female spirit took them and as for the aunt, seriously thought she got what she deserved and yes she a nosy person who was trying to get trouble started for no reason at all. It is a definite must see but not alone."

","Nice movie who has been 2 genre: drama and horror. The movie tells a story about 2 girls how are abandoned in the woods. This girls supposed to be killed by there dad but a wood creature, how raises the girls up for a few years, without contact with the outside world.<br/><br/>Apart from the creature that later in the film a spirit of a crazy woman turns out to be, it is a good story of how a child changed by living in the woods without contact with the outside world. a nice piece of this in the beginning when the oldest of the two girls recognized her uncle as her father and shows that she is her life for the woods not forget. Also is the story of the wood creature called Mama, a story how can happen for real. Sometimes children has taken away by there mother, bit is there a strong relationship between mother and child who makes the children escape from home at night. If you like this kind of story's this is a very good movie to watch. <br/><br/>On the other hand u have horror, this is made because the one who raises the children is not a human but a wood creature how is moving in to the walls and flying moths. Also gives she the woman that takes care of the children a dream within the sorry of the death of the woman how is now the creature Mama. a good effect in this film is that you and the woman who cares for the children, in the course of the film find out how Mama looks. This allows for slightly more horror in the film.<br/><br/>Overall is this a very good movie whit a great story and a lot of exciting moments."
"maybakmusic","8","1","2","23 October 2013"," A horror movie worth watching
","I have no clue why IMDb has this at a 6.3 rating; or why IMDb has the new Evil Dead at 6.something rating. You shouldn't watch movies like these, if you don't like horror. This is a good horror movie (so was Evil Dead). Horror fans will like this.<br/><br/>The basic aspect of the story is kind of cool, but the twists are really amazing. I actually would have enjoyed having the doctor guy's secretive involvement panned out more. <br/><br/>We all know that it is the story of a ghost raising two children who were lost and abandoned in the woods; then they are found and rescued, and the ghost mother follows them and kills, hurts, or haunts, the people around the children. But the way that the human characters learn about the what the being is, and how they confront it in a way, and interact with it, is really good. <br/><br/>It wasn't the best movie of all time, but it was definitely worth watching. One of the better horror films to come out in the last few years. I would give this a 9, because it really was that good, but there were a few cheap scares in this movie - you know everything is quiet and then SCREECH as something comes into the camera frame. I really dislike that when its done for that reason alone, rather than having it represent how the characters realistically would feel and interact (like when the boyfriend wakes up in the dorm room, in that movie Exorcism of Emily Rose :)"
"rossini-1868","6","1","2","22 October 2013"," ""Mama"" or ""Pacific Rim?""
","Parts of this movie are genuinely scary. About as scary as any movie has been in a long time. Enough so that you wonder why Guillermo del Toro will not direct these movies instead of just signing his name to them. If Steven Spielberg is smart enough to direct a gem like ""War of the Worlds"", and Peter Jackson ""The Lovely Bones"" or ""King Kong"", when is Del Toro going to get smart enough to direct movies like ""The Orphanage"" or ""Don't Be Afraid of the Dark"" or ""Mama?"" The lonely, creepy, isolated atmosphere, the intense focus on the mother and daughter characters, the classic female character in jeopardy with little or no outside help or influence... Robert Zemeckis did this with ""What Lies Beneath"" and we can not be thankful enough. I hope that Del Toro will wake up from his ""Pacific Rim"" delusion of grandeur and treat us to a movie like ""Mama"" crafted with his own special directorial ability soon."
"GirishGowda","7","1","2","24 September 2013"," Mama has the most terrifying cold opening of the year
","The senior partner of an investment brokerage Jeffrey (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) has a breakdown and kills his two associates and his wife. Then he takes his three-year old daughter Victoria and the one-year old daughter Lilly and drives his car through a winding snowing road. He has a car accident and fall off a cliff, but he brings his daughters to an abandoned and isolated cabin to kill them, but the children are saved by a creepy ghostly creature. Five years later, Jeffrey's twin brother Lucas finds the children that were raised without social relationship and claim that they have been raised by Mama. Lucas disputes the custody with the children's grandmother but Dr. Dreyfuss, who is studying the girls, selects Lucas to take care of the children. Lucas lives with his girlfriend Annabel (Jessica Chastain), who plays in a rock'n'roll band, and Victoria and Lilly moves to their house. Soon Lucas and Annabel find that the girls were not delusional and they are not alone in the house.<br/><br/>The cold opening scene where the father takes his kids to the cabin might be the most terrifying and heartbreaking opening of the year. It is so powerful that what follows after it seems quite mundane in comparison. Mama is quite refreshing in the sense that it fleshes out the kids characters unlike countless other horror movies which make them just caricatures and nothing else. The movie has a few genuine scary moments and is consistently creepy to th brim, but it should be viewed as a psychological drama first. If it weren't trapped in the horror genre, this could have been a great character study. There are a few jump scares and though I liked the ending, which I did not see coming, many might not feel the same way. Nikolaj (Jamie Lannister from Game of Thrones) and Jessica Chastain are good in their roles, but its the kids, Isabelle Nélisse and Megan Charpentier who are the real highlights of the movie. I also felt that Nikolaj's role was unnecessarily trimmed down instead of fleshing his character out more. The cgi kinda makes it hard to get scared when Mama is eventually revealed in all her special effects glory. Still, a good, original horror movie worth watching.<br/><br/>7/10"

","Mama was rather terrifying, just the way a good horror movie should be. It had a great story behind it initially showing a ghost following and protecting the two children made us think that it would be the girls mother, who was deceased for this movie, but then as they are found and re-socialised into life it becomes clear with all the strange goings on and attacks that it is not their mother. 'Why would their mother attack the people who care for them?' The movie uses the classic JUMP tactic to terrify the audience and really have them on the seat but fear not as this is always followed up with some terrifying image or disturbance. Throughout the whole terrifying experience the acting and the storyline is great and the ending is never seen coming. (INSERT MAJOR SPOILER) At the end of the movie when they have figured out the ghosts story and it appears they have found it peace, the youngest of the children cries out for her leading her to return to her and in the end jump from the cliff with young lily, while the elder one chose to stay behind. The ending was definitely unseen on my part, I thought now that they had found her peace that the children would live happily ever after where they are, but that was not to be the case. Overall I found it truly amazing, unpredictable and petrifying most of the time. 9/10."

Obviously the story did get a revamp and the interesting idea got worked out into a feature length. Which worked out very nice. And it's not only the cast that helps here, the director shows, that he is able to handle a bigger budget as well.<br/><br/>There are some genuine creepy moments in this and Jessica Chastain has one major role to play even though she seems to be second fiddle (in more than on sense). There are many things in this movie that get touched upon and they do work nicely (parenthood, growing up, responsibilities and more). The director is one to look out for."

","Initially I was not too enamored with the plot line but interested enough to give the movie a shot. So many horror movies have promised much and delivered little to the point that I have given up on watching a movie that entertains and surprises me. Whilst Evil Dead served up bloody gore with a reasonable storyline and some really good acting, Mama has finally delivered what all other movies have promised. I'm not one for writing spoilers so rest assured that this review won't have any.<br/><br/>Mama delivers some good shocks, moments where you'll be telling the actors 'not to go in there' plus a very unique and interesting twist that I have not witnessed in any other movie. It is this twist that makes the movie stand out from its peers and has encouraged me to endorse this movie for others to watch and to make their own decision.<br/><br/>This movie takes the ghost movie genre to a different level that once repeated will immediately lose it's appeal, and as such has made it's mark on me.<br/><br/>I hope that you enjoy this feature for the originality it offers."

"lathe-of-heaven","7","1","2","20 July 2013"," Good, Creepy, Old-School Horror. BUT... You need to be able to suspend disbelief and enjoy some Fantasy elements in your Horror...
","I really LOVE Guillermo Del Toro. THAT guy is truly talented. So, anytime I see where he has ANYTHING to do with a film, I definitely want to check it out. One VERY strong film that he produced recently was 'THE ORPHANAGE' which was excellent.<br/><br/>This one though I would say falls somewhat short of that. It IS a good Horror film, but a Horror film with a strong Retro - Old School, low key style. Firstly, it IS indeed a PG-13, so if you are one of these hard core, Luv-2-see-m-tortured-wid-Lotz-of-blud, forget it. Secondly, and this is VERY important if you are reading this to determine whether you will like this film or not. You will only enjoy this movie IF you enjoy a fairly strong Fantasy element AND if you are able to submerse yourself into Supernatural stories. Sooooo... if you are one of these people who like there Horror 'Realistic' or true to life, you won't like it...<br/><br/>The look and mood of the film is excellent. The cinematography and the direction are very well done. I can see why this guy caught Guillermo's attention. The style, especially towards the end, is VERY Del Toro-esque. This is almost like a faerie tale in a way. Thus, why I am saying that you really DO have to like Fantasy elements in your Horror in order to enjoy this film. If not, you are simply going to be bored, find it unbelievable, be rolling your eyes, and then you'll come here and write how lousy the film is. So, that is why I am saying it is important whether you like that element in your Horror films or not.<br/><br/>The acting is excellent. At first, I didn't think I was gonna like the lead woman because I thought 'Oh, here we go with the Punk Chick cliché' But, I was surprised that as the film went on, I had to admire her subtle adaptation to the situation and her versatility. I looked up the actress here on IMDb and I didn't even RECOGNIZE her! <br/><br/>Also, the children do a superb job. If you like Fantasy / Horror concerning children (not EVIL Killer children, simply about children) then you will certainly appreciate the excellent job done here by them. I was AMAZED at the youngest one, because she had to express so many primitive emotions and reactions and she did them in an amazingly believable way! Usually with a child actor this young, I would expect her to come across as too much, over the top, and VERY unconvincing. But, this little girl was frigg'n AWESOME and I found myself just sitting here, stunned with how damn good she was. She FAR overshadowed the older girl, although her performance was fine too.<br/><br/>So, all in all, YES, this is a very well made and effective Horror film IF you like lighter, more low key Horror with some Fantasy elements included. You also have to be rather forgiving of some of the ghostly CG effects, because the story calls for them. So, if you are one to say 'GEEZ, what CHEEEEEEZY CG crap!' then that may diminish your enjoyment of the movie. YES, there are a lot of 'jump-scares', but they are mostly effective and had me changing my pants several times..."

","MAMA (dir. Andres Muschietti) This movie is an unparalleled, super- terrific 'thrill ride' of a ghost film. It's executive producer is horror master Guillermo del Toro, and the film provides a maximum of mind blowing excitement and terrifying images that are solidly backed by an unforgettable storyline. <br/><br/>After a mysterious shooting, two very young sisters are abandoned in a creepy cabin deep in the forest and raised by a ghost who they refer to as 'mama'. For nearly five years their uncle and his rock-chick girlfriend have been unsuccessfully trying to locate them. Finally the girls are rescued, and brought back to suburbia to reclaim their shot at a comfortable middle-class life. But these two siblings are very rough around the psychic edges, and unearthly mischief and mayhem sticks to them like paranormal ectoplasm.<br/><br/>The film's superior production team employs unbelievable dream sequences and computer generated special effects to propel the story that were widely popularized by Japanese and Korean filmmakers such as Kiyoshi Kurosawa, Takashi Miike, Bong Joon-ho, and Kim Ji-woon during the 90's. However, in no way is the film an homage, but MAMA is a brilliant standout in the Horror Genre, and very much a MUST SEE."

","Not really spoilers here, but I hit the check box just in case.<br/><br/>There are very intense moments in this movie, there's a scene maybe 10 minutes in where the children's father is about the pull off a murder/suicide that really brought some emotions out in me. <br/><br/>Jumps spots, yeah there's quite a few. Mama herself is very scary but (one of my dislikes in the movie) she's shown so much after the midway point you almost get used to it and the scare factor is off, the way she moves around is very cool though.<br/><br/>Loses a little steam at the end, there's not a happy ending which I did like, or else this would of gotten a lower grade for predictability.<br/><br/>Just on a side note, this might be one of the first Del Toro movies where one of his creatures doesn't have eyeballs in their palms (i.e. Hellboy, Pan's Lab)<br/><br/>Definitely one of the better horror films I've seen in the last twelve months though, and I watch a fair amount."

","To start off with, I just want to compliment the psychological side of this movie. It's amazing in that, like the Saw franchise, you can get into the head of Mama. Both movies have an extremely different way of making you empathize with the ""baddie"", Saw having what I think is the more interesting way, but both are something special. In most movies the aim of the game is to make you despise the bad guy and put all your heart for the good guy, but in this movie you see both sides and you realize that you would be happy if either side got what they wished. In the case of Mama, both sides got half of the prize and I think that in itself is an entirely unique concept. Amazing! I would give ten out of ten but I can't claim to have seen all the horror movies in the world so I couldn't really say if it's one of the best or not. It's definitely a contender though!"
"richieandsam","8","1","2","2 July 2013"," I liked it a lot.
","MAMA<br/><br/>This was a good movie. I really enjoyed this one.<br/><br/>This is a horror movie about a guy who kills his wife and takes his 2 kids away... but when his car crashes, he gets lost in the woods until he finds a cabin. He takes his children inside, but there is spirit in there protecting the children. The spirit then follows the children into the city when they go and live with their uncle.<br/><br/>It is not very scary... there were a couple of attempts of jump scares, but not too many... and none of them made me jump anyway.<br/><br/>The story was very good and there were quite a few emotions throughout the film. At some points of the film I felt so sorry for the children, but then something would happen and the next minute I would think the kids are evil. All the way through you don't really know whether the kids are good or not.<br/><br/>There was one scene in the film that was really horrible. There was a woman who had a dream and this dream was horrible. There is a baby in the dream and I felt so bad for this baby. It looked so scared.<br/><br/>The effects were not brilliant at times, but that didn't ruin the movie. The story and the acting carried it through well.<br/><br/>The actors were all really good... especially the children. Normally I find child actors very annoying and too young to have much talent. But not in this case. Both kids did a great job. The stars are Jessica Chastain, Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, Megan Charpentier & Isabelle Nelisse.<br/><br/>I will give this film 8 out of 10.<br/><br/>I really liked it. Great story, mixed emotions about the characters and great acting. A horror film that is definitely worth watching.<br/><br/>For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:<br/><br/>https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl"
"jukangliwayway","8","1","2","29 June 2013"," this movie ruined the sweet word ""mama"" for me. Creepy.
","Mama may not be the perfect horror flick, but it sure has all the right elements of a good movie. The horror is palpable, the story is well- crafted, the cinematography is perfect for the setting, the music/ambient sounds are chilling, and while I can't say that the whole cast gave a solid performance I think it's safe to say that the two girls are the stars in this movie. I love that the terror is almost tangible perfectly backed up by the dark yet stunning visuals reminiscent of Del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth. Not a disappointing first film for Andy Muschietti, because even though the elements in this movie are not original, he has managed to put in his own flavor, twist an already familiar bits & pieces from popular horror movies and turn it into something effectively chilling without making us feel cheated. The clichés worked. At least for me. I'm looking forward to another Del Toro-Muschietti collaboration.<br/><br/>check out my blog for the full review :) http://strangereview.blogspot.com/2013/06/mama-2013.html"
"Smut_ographic","Null","1","2","20 June 2013"," it could of been a lot better in my opinion.
","on the whole this film is jumpy and not very scary it plays more on the nerve endings of horror and leads more into the darker world of fantasy and any film with a child or children as the main role in a horror or paranormal film will always hit home for most adults as the innocence of a child being ruined by something unknown is literally every parent's fear i can imagine, this film is definitely worth the watch but not worth the hype most of the best or scary bits are in the trailer making this film a bit redundant when you see the finished product. in comparison with other such films to appear lately i would have to say that sinister ranks at a higher level of entertainment and shock value than it's opposite Mama and really delivers a strong sense of wrongdoing to the plot and leaves your mind thinking."
"KEmerton1992","7","1","2","13 June 2013"," Not quite horror, still quite good
","To begin, I had little to no interest in seeing this film when I first heard of it. After a few reviews from friends I decided that I would check it out when it came out on DVD. I just finished the film and must say that I don't know where all the bad reviews are coming from. It wasn't quite as scary as a horror film should be, but that doesn't make it a bad film. I found that the story was able to keep my attention quite well. It reminded me of ""Ju-On: The Grudge"" and other Asian horror films. Mama's face was very creepy and her voice was down right scary. I wish I had taken the time to see this while it was still in theaters. The one and only true complaint I had with the film was that during scenes that were supposed to take place in the middle of the night, there was this bright light shining through the windows. Besides that, I had no complaints. Horror fan or not, you will most likely enjoy this film."
"mag689-705-393309","9","1","2","6 June 2013"," Well done creepy thriller with some heart
","Many reviews already written, so I'll keep this simple. I enjoyed this horror/thriller movie from start to finish. The atmospheric shifts from the real world, to the 'dark' were well crafted and definitely felt visceral. Lighting was used to the same effect. The acting was believable throughout, and character growth, especially with Jessica and the children flowed naturally. Excellent supporting cast as well. Creepy 'mama' entity, sometimes flat out disturbing to look at as she moved & writhed about. Often scares would come quietly and out of no where. Rarely have had a horror movie that could move you to at least a tear at the end, but this one will do it. No need for idiotic excessive profanity, gore or useless nudity in this picture. It's crafted to stand on it's merits as a horror thriller with heart, and succeeds at that quite well. Lastly the story itself was well executed & kept you waiting for the next piece of information. Certainly not perfect, but far above so much that's been released. If you like this genre, pick this up, sit back, & be prepared for a ride."
"TxMike","Null","1","2","2 June 2013"," I'm not a horror fan, but I quite liked this movie.
","There is a 2008 film short, only 3 minutes long, of the same name, 'Mama'. It inspired this movie after del Toro saw it and bargained with the author for a script for the feature-length version. The short film is included as an ""extra"" on the DVD, it too is an interesting watch.<br/><br/>This movie has a rather simple premise but details are introduced gradually so as to build the suspense. We see an early scene with a father and his two young children driving perhaps too fast on a remote road while it is snowing, and distracted by the older daughter saying ""Please slow down daddy"" they slid and crashed down an embankment. They find a creepy-looking cabin in the forest and seek shelter there.<br/><br/>The story then switches to five years later, and the man's brother is still spending most of his spare time and spare money looking for the missing man and his daughters. The man and his brother, perhaps twins, are both played by Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau as Lucas (the alive brother) and Jeffrey (who disappeared 5 years earlier). The nominal star of the movie is Jessica Chastain as Annabel, a 30-something who acts more like a teenager and playing bass guitar in a rock band, but married to Lucas. She certainly is not prepared to be a mother.<br/><br/>Let's just say the girls are found but their dad isn't, and Lucas and Annabel are pressed into service trying to re-normalize these two girls, 8 and 6, who have been in the wild for 5 years. Not much goes as planned! The two girls are played by Megan Charpentier as 8-yr-old Victoria and French Canadian Isabelle Nélisse, who spoke no English before being cast, as 6-yr-old Lilly.<br/><br/>Most horror movies I have seen, not a favorite genre of mine, are more boring than horrific. But this one genuinely gave me chills several times, I found it very effective and good entertainment.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: The story goes way back to the 1800s when a woman escaped from a mental ward with a tiny baby, ultimately hunted by a mob. She jumped off a cliff towards water below, but she hit a large branch sticking out, breaking most of her body parts, and she floated dead in the water. But the baby in its wrappings was snagged by the branch and recovered. The dead woman's ghost became the 'Mama' of this movie, she forever haunted one place or the other looking to replace her lost baby. She actually watched over the two girls during that 5-year period. But now she had followed them to their new house, almost killed Lucas, spooked Annabel, and overall was a constant source of havoc in their lives. So they were able to get rid of her only after reuniting her with the remains of her baby, long stored in a box in a government building. But she also took Lilly with her, as Victoria stayed with her new parents, her aunt and uncle."
"mistercline1-551-766146","5","1","2","27 May 2013"," Every aspect of this movie is well-done besides one key ingredient!
","This movie had the potential to be a great ghost movie. The set-ups were well-done, the acting was very well-done (especially the little girls), the cinematography was impressive, and the directing was impressive. But then you see the ghost and you see computer animation! Which is fine if done in a way that makes it feel real, but while watching this movie you are fully aware that this is a computer animated image, which takes away from the creepiness of a movie. Computer animated monsters don't scare people. If a villain looks human enough to not make the viewer aware of special effects, that is what makes people's minds escape into the movie and truly be scared. There have been many movies over the last few years that would have been great horror films had they spent more time making the villain look real. I don't understand why studios lately don't realize that this is why their horror films are failing at the box office..."
"jacklmauro","7","1","2","26 May 2013"," Truly Good - Could've Been Great
","It's so frustrating to finally see a horror film that could be something rare and wonderful - a lovely horror film - and then watch it fall short because of a few key mistakes. First off, this is good. Really good. Bored beyond measure by today's emphasis on visuals, I feel the art and graphics here are stunning and different. The acting is high, high quality straight through, with the possible exception of the thankless role of the sister-in-law. The story itself is mythic and haunting. Best of all is Chastain's arc from (believable) rock chick to mom. How great it would have been, had the trajectory simply built on the growing rivalry between the two female forces. It does to a degree, but it goes off in sad places. As in silly, easily avoidable plot and character lapses: why would the doctor not warn Annabel (it couldn't hurt his agenda), and no hubris brings a lone man to that cabin at night, knowing what he knows. Or: the dumb, late night appearance of the sister-in-law. Aaaaargh. Then - why introduce the father's spirit only once? Is he not as strong a ghost as Mama? Lastly, utterly unforgivable is Luke's rising at the end, after Mama hand-spears him. I didn't want him dead, but dead is better than an actor having to play that, 'huh, what happened?' moment. Still. The ending is nicely set up (and borrows beautifully from 'The Uninvited'), and actually affecting emotionally. How many horror movies can make that claim? As said, this is so close to greatness, it makes you angry."
"FredHowe651","Null","1","2","19 May 2013"," Good solid horror effort
","Good acting, a monster that I don't see too little, good effects, and a story I can get into. This movie is nothing epic, but it's a horror movie that ""works.""<br/><br/>First time feature director Andrés Muschietti does a solid job with atmosphere and ""creepy."" The story gets moving when two orphaned girls are discovered in an abandoned cabin in the woods after five years somehow surviving on their own (now they're about 9 and 7 years old). Their eyes are cold and scared yet somehow predatory, their hair and skin far beyond wildly filthy, and their movement is so unnatural that it reminds me more of a Silent Hill monster than an animal. <br/><br/>Much to my surprise, the maternal poltergeist Mama was not a kept mystery. Mama, her appearance, what she's capable of and her relationship with the girls are all presented to us right away. So when the feral Victoria and Lilly are taken in by uncle Lucas and his girlfriend Annabel, the movie doesn't rely on us wondering when Mama will pop up and reign terror on the new foster parents. Instead we watch the girls maintain a secret relationship with Mama while remaining emotionally distant from Lucas and Annabel.<br/><br/>But once their child psychologist and the new parents catch on to Mama's presence, simply a psychological manifestation or even a home invader by their perception, Mama feels threatened. And once the girls begin to open up to the doctor or feel affection for their new parents, Mama gets angry! <br/><br/>What's interesting is how this movie has such a simple story with one simple revelation toward its end, no red herrings and no real surprises, yet, it really works. I thought they had some trouble making the finale at the end come together, actually I thought it was too drawn out, but overall I was very pleased with this movie.<br/><br/>We start out feeling edgy about the girls, and as they normalise we start feeling edgy about Mama. And Mama is worth feeling edgy about. She looks quite contorted, distorted and disturbing. I felt continuously worried about what this apparition was going to do next, and the pace of the movie never disappoints.<br/><br/>I feel like we've been trained to find terrible acting to be totally acceptable when it comes to horror. But Mama's cast features nothing but competency and a few pleasant surprises. Of course, no one should be shocked that Jessica Chastain pulled off the stand-offish girlfriend turned hesitant parent. <br/><br/>Definitely would recommend this if you like horror films."
"maya-822","7","1","2","19 May 2013"," well done and beautiful
","In 2008, the Argentine Andrés Muschietti directed ""Mama"", a 3-minute short-film that Guillermo del Toro watched and liked so much that he decided to produce a longer feature. In the 2008 version, a little girl wakes her sister up in the middle of the night and tells her that ""Mama"" is back. They both go downstairs in an empty house. They see something that looks like a woman moving in a room at the end of the hall. The ""thing"" is threatening. The music is nagging and throbbing. Something is going to happen. Mama walks out of the room and runs at abnormal speed toward the children. She is barefoot and her body is deformed. The girls scream and run back to the first floor. The younger girl slams the bedroom's door and leaves the older out. She looks at Mama moving toward her. The thing's walk is dislocated, her face is hideous. The music panics. The girl screams. The end. The same scene is present in the 2013 movie, which is an enhanced and more explicit version of this primitive scene. After he lost it and killed his wife and co-workers, Jeffrey (best known under the name of Jaime Lannister) runs away with his daughters. They have an accident on the road and find refuge in a cabin by the lake in the middle of the wood. There, Jeffrey plans to shoot her daughters than kill himself, but the ghost in the cabin prevents it and takes care of him. Five years later, two detectives paid by Lucas, Jeffrey's twin brother, finally find the crashed car and the cabin with the girls. They are alive but they live in a wild primitive state and they pretend that they were raised by a supernatural entity they call ""Mama"". Lucas and her girlfriend Anabel (Jessica Chastain, the actress-chameleon) are thirty something but they live like teenagers. He draws and she plays the guitar in a rock band. Nevertheless, the psychiatrist in charge of the girls decide to give them custody and to lend them a house to raise the girls in proper conditions. As it is often the case, joint custody does not go well and Mama is jealous of the girls' new parents. Childhood is a recurring theme in horror movies. The child is innocent, fragile and defenceless against evil and the corruption of the adults' world. But what the horror genre is interested in is the reversal, and loss, of values, the devilish side of the angels' faces. The trope of the child-victim and child-killer is almost as old as the horror genre itself. After initial ambiguity, the film chooses one unequivocal representation of the child as basically pure and good. Adults don't need to protect themselves from them, they need to protect them. The film is actually pretty unsurprising and uses some of the genre's most common clichés and twists : a cabin in the wood, people visiting the cabin in the middle of the night, scary dolls, weird children, a ghost in the closet, a crazy mother, heavy music, etc. But ""Mama"" is a genre movie that fully acknowledges these stereotypes. And it works. Muschietti's directing is clever and effective. The main interest of the film is the characterization of Jeffrey, Anabel, the girls AND the ghost. Muschietti managed to find a right balance to make them ""real"" and make the viewer care for all of them. They are not mere embodiments. Even Mama is not pure evil, she is ambivalent, both motherly and destructive. The film is less based on violence than on anguish. Some ideas I thought were interesting, for example the physical concretization of the haunted house theme. The film is all about atmosphere, about something that is there, lurking, that kills not out of pleasure but because it is suffering. It lives in the walls, it becomes the walls, it corrupts them. It lives in corpses, but it is not really living, it's only articulated death. It takes possession of people's dreams, but it still remains estranged from the living world. Only the child can communicate with it, and love it, because only the child can see the living and the dead as two different but equal things. The end is not like any conventional Hollywood ending. Only that suffices to make the film interesting. But it's not only that. There's beauty in ""Mama"", there's an impossible love, there's black and troubling poetry.

"jackmeat","Null","1","2","12 May 2013"," A very well made horror/thriller
","Movie review:I had to pick one for Mothers day, and since I wanted to see this anyway, it works perfectly. Very good choice. Knowing first off Guillermo del Torro has his name in the mix (he produced it, among other things I am sure) I was aware it was going to be a good film. The story is about a family that is torn apart by a massive collapse in the stock market. Well, that more or less leads into the actual story. When the father of two young girls goes on a murder spree, including his estranged wife, he packs up his children and speeds off to destination unknown where he intends to commit suicide. After crashing off the road, the three wander into a broken down house in the forest and just before he pulls the trigger, a strange ""figure"" snatches him away, leaving the children to fend for themselves. The oldest daughter, Victoria (Megan Charpentier) catches a glimpse of the ""figure"" flying out the door with the father in tow, but her glasses were broken, so she could not make out what she saw. The two kids are left alone for 5 years before they are found, but how alone were they to survive on their own? The search was funded by an inheritance from his brother to find them. Now after a short legal battle, it is up to Lucas (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) and Annabel (Jessica Chastain) to raise the girls that had become feral animals that were now under a psychiatrists care. Dr. Dreyfuss (Daniel Kash) arranges for the new family to move into a home where he would have access to this mysterious case. The children slowly become accustomed to their ""new"" parents but also it becomes apparent that ""Mama"", as the children call her, is also there. Mamas presence is known by an appearance of black moths and electrical disturbances that often go unseen. At first this is playful things like games with the kids, etc. but when Mama gets jealous and pushes Lucas down the stairs, putting him into a coma, it is up to Anabel to raise the kids she was hesitant to do in the first place. As Mama makes her presence more known in the house, she puts ""dreams"" into Anabels head so she can see what happened. From these dreams, we see Mama stab a nun and running away with a baby (named Lily) she stole. She is followed by the townspeople to a cliff where Mama and Lily dive off to their death. There is more to this which should be seen to put it together without writing all of it out. This may seem like other ghost stories, and in a way it is, but this has so much feeling as to the why Mama is so trapped and engaged with this children. The movie as a whole moves at a very nice pace and uses subtle times to develop the characters without taking up too much time. The use of Mama does start as more of a ghost-type figure but as it progresses, the anguish Mama is going through begins to show through.Since this is a horror movie, I would be failing in not pointing something out, this movie is very creepy. There are visuals and camera-work that are used that will really scare you. The entire production quality of this movie is top notch. Very little, if anything, is left untouched in the story. It was the little things that were done to create the atmosphere in this movie that really pushed it along and made it so enjoyable. All things done, including acting, cinematography, to editing all run us through this tormenting story of Mama and her sheer need for closure. This all leads up to a crescendo that cultivates into the finale of a story that even though may seem like the usual haunting, is nothing but usual at all. So if you are looking for a gorefest, this is not for you, but if you want a very well made horror/thriller that will say more to your mind than any blood splatter will give, this is for you. 7.4/10 IMDb 6.4 Boo, IMDb, I am normally agreeing with ya, but this film is highly recommended by me. ENJOY (as warned to a friend of mine, don't watch this one alone on Mothers Day)"

","I have to say, this was a surprisingly intriguing and well-made horror movie! <br/><br/>The story is a little different, and I think that's the reason why I really got into this movie. On top of that, I loved the design of ""Mama"". It reminded me of some kind of Silent Hill creature, blended with The Grudge and a witch, if that makes any sense.<br/><br/>The acting was great! The child actors did a very good job, especially the older one. It had some really touching scenes and I even got some watery eyes near the end. Almost crying, from a horror movie? Now that's rare.<br/><br/>But has the movie flaws? Yes, unfortunately it does. I would say the movie has seven characters. That's not that much, but the movie choose to focus on our main protagonist and the two children, which it definitely should! The problem is that the other characters don't get much screen time, and therefore they become less interesting, which means you don't care for them as much. I wanted to root for everybody with this kind of character development dammit! Oh well.<br/><br/>It also has some very predictable jump scares, and that bothered me because this movie would have been just as creepy without the jump scares! On a positive note, there were no cheap boo-right-in-your-face scares. Most of them had some sort of cleverness.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie did really satisfy me, both in story and thrill. It's not for every horror fan though."

"asda-man","7","1","2","28 February 2013"," Big Mama's house
","Mama's getting an unfair reception! I went in with somewhat low expectations giving all the heavily negative reviews from people. Mama wasn't a must-see film for me, it just happened that a red-headed warrior was interested in it. However, I was pleasantly surprised with what I got! Mama immediately grabbed me from its intriguing opening which was also beautifully shot and felt very Spanish so I knew that I was in good hands, directing-wise. The imagery was atmospheric and almost fairytale-like which was apparent from the opening letters, ""Once Upon A Time"" but don't get too excited because it's not as fairytale related as Pan's Labryinth or Livid. I was also surprised at the amount of suspense in this opening sequence too so once it was over with an effective jump scare, I was at ease.<br/><br/>Mama plays out like a haunted house movie but it has a much deeper story than that. We're introduced to some likable characters and some surprisingly un-annoying child actors! The girls were actually really good and not as wooden as you'd think they'd be. Every scene is filled with tension and I found myself feeling quite scared in some moments, which is unusual for me and was also something I wasn't expecting. The director (don't know his name, some confusing foreign name I gather) certainly knows how to work his audience and I look forward to what he can conjure up next.<br/><br/>Now, if jump scares annoy you for any reason then you might want to give Mama a miss because a lot of the scares rely on jump scares. Nevertheless, these jump scares are extremely well done and the build-up to them is done with nail-biting tension! Mama may only be offering cheap thrills, but they're done in a genuinely scary way and the film does also feature a string of effective and creepy moments which adds to the atmosphere. Mama is never boring either and never forgets its entertainment value or characters. I also found the look of Mama to be quite creepy which is contrary to what a lot of people believe. Sometimes the CGI did look a bit shoddy and some of the floaty effects were over-done, but her face was actually genuinely creepy.<br/><br/>The sound effects were also top-notch and are really but to great use in the cinema. There's a moment where a character goes into the dark cabin and you know Mama's there, but you can't see her, all you can hear are these horrible groans and Grudge-like croaky noises and it's actually very creepy! Granted, Mama uses some clichés such as the old Rear Window flashing camera effect but that also conjures up one of the best jump scares in the film and really does fill the scene with tension. So although clichés are used, they're used effectively and do offer some great entertainment.<br/><br/>Mama can be original too though. There's a really great flash-back sequence which I've never seen the likes off before. It's like an expressionist painting all in the point of view of Mama and it creates a great impact and allows you to gain verstehen for Mama's mysterious character. My only real complaint about the film is that it does lose its way with the ending. Mama stops being creepy because she starts to function too much like a human and we see far too much of her. Everything feels a bit silly and rushed and also gave me vibes of the ending for Hocus Pocus for some reason, which is not good. Don't get me wrong I love Hocus Pocus, but it's a Disney film and I should not be feeling vibes of a Disney film in a serious horror film.<br/><br/>Ending aside, Mama is a great night out. It's not as amazing as Insidious or Sinsiter, but it has an original and interesting idea behind it and is played out in a superiorly creepy way to most ghosty films. Mama always kept me entertained and the tension-filled directing is sure to keep you on edge. The film is full of great atmosphere and imagery which stops it from being another forgettable haunted house movie. I think people are giving Mama an unfair time. I really enjoyed it and so did the people I saw it with. I anticipate what this director has up his sleeves next time!"
"bebins","8","1","2","17 February 2013"," Mama just killed a man (Well quite a few actually)
","The horror is mostly predictable and while you'll see the scares coming, they'll probably still make you jump a little but that aside Mama is easily the most moving ghost story since ""Ringu"" (the Ring)an emotional tale efficiently and affectingly told without the gore that we've become desensitised to.<br/><br/>The film doesn't overstay its welcome at just over an hour and a half and provides a decent ending which could or couldn't lead to a sequel.<br/><br/>Guillermo del Toro's contribution may have lead to many people's interest, as he was responsible for ""Pan's Labyrinth."" Despite the commercials, he had little creative control over ""Mama,"" working only as an executive producer."

","It was so crowded when I went to go see this movie. So many people were laughing and whispering. That wasn't a problem at all. Its just one of those horror movies where something pops up out of nowhere making you scream... and then everyone starts laughing. But it was a well done ghost/monster story that won't make you fall asleep, trust me. In fact I was unhappy because it felt a little short to me. The mama thing is very gritty looking and whenever she would appear everybody in the theater would start freaking out. How much screaming there was made it similar to the paranormal activity commercials. Lots of suspense moments especially when Jessica Chastain's character would walk towards the closet. Its also a very original story and if you are familiar with Guillermo Del Toro then you should see it. Just because the mama is computer generated doesn't also mean it sucks. Mama proves that."

Very well produced and based on director Andres Muschietti's short film with a beautiful production design by Anastasia Masaro and gorgeous cinematography by Antonio Riestra is underscored with a baroque score by Fernando Velazquez. The cast is uniformly excellent with a barely recognizable Chastain as the goth girlfriend/musician who rises to the challenge in raising her beau's new family; Coaster-Waldau has double duty as the girl's doomed father and caring uncle attempting to find a balance but it's the two young charges, Charpentier and Nelisse as the sweet yet scary good girls - they are the heart and soul of a film that runs the gamut of thrills and chills until ultimately a so-so end."
"jdssuperstar6","3","2","8","31 May 2013"," Beautiful Scenery, Horrible Movie
","This movie is quite frustrating for me to talk about... The film is not good at all.. The acting is very good and I appreciate that on behalf of some of the horror movies that have been coming out lately, but the scares and the ability to keep the audience on the edge of their seat is just not there.. The CGI is out of this world and actually used for about thirty minutes straight near the conclusion of the film.... For a drama this is okay, but to list it under the horror section is quite absurd....I found the film to be actually quite dreadful to watch, ( not in a good way)... The ending is HORRIBLE and was definitely not worth my time... I was very disappointed at the end because I was expecting much more from MAMA.. Don't listen to the other reviews MAMA will leave you saying ""I JUST WASTED AN HOUR AND THIRTY MINUTES OF MY LIFE"""

","If you are a fan of Hitchcock and not a gore freak you will love this movie..the suspense is what makes it great, only seeing peeks of Mama throughout the film until the end. The actresses playing the little girls are absolutely fantastic and, as always Jessica Chastain delivers a spot on performance. There are few missteps in the plot line but the suspense continues to build throughout. It is filmed with just enough creepiness to keep you enthralled. I was in a theater that had NO empty seats and the collective GASP during certain scenes showed just how much we were all enthralled and into the movie. Can't wait to see it again to watch and catch some of the nuances I'm sure I missed during the ""hide-your-eyes"" parts. There is NO gore in this movie, just a few ""icky"" parts, it is pure suspense."
"jboothmillard","3","2","9","3 July 2013"," Mama
","I was disappointed when I missed the opportunity to see this film at the cinema, having the terrific scary movies Insidious and Sinister, but I was surprised to see the critics give this a low rating, I was still going to watch it though. Basically investment brokerage senior partner Jeffrey (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) has a mental breakdown and kills his two associates and wife, and then he tries to kill his two daughters, three year old Victoria and one year old Lilly, driving with them through the snow on a winding road. He crashes the car after going off road and off a cliff, but they survive the crash, and they find an empty isolated cabin, and when the father tries to kill his daughter again a creepy ghost attacks him and saves them. Five years pass the children are found by Jeffrey's brother Lucas (also Coaster-Waldau), they have been raised without social relationship with real people, Victoria (Megan Charpentier) and Lilly (Isabelle Nélisse) claim they have been raised by maternal protective figure Mama. Lucas suggests they should be put in the custody of their grandmother, but instead he himself is chosen by Dr. Dreyfuss (Daniel Kash) as the one to take care of them, the doctor is studying the girls in regard to their behaviour and former living environment, specifically the claim of Mama. Lucas lives with his girlfriend Annabel (Zero Dark Thirty's Jessica Chastain), she plays in a rock and roll band, the young girls move into their house, and soon enough they bring their delusional and almost animalistic behaviour with them, but also they are not alone. Sisters Victoria and Lilly have also brought with them the supernatural forces of the unknown entity Mama that can shape-shift and cause all sorts of occurrences, chaos and terror happens for them all, of course in the end the bad stuff goes away. Also starring Javier Botet as Mama, David Fox as Burnsie and Dominic Cuzzocrea as Ron. Chastain is, I agree with the critics, a very unconvincing goth punk rocker, black hair or not, so I could not pay much attention to her, to be honest, even with the involvement of Guillermo del Toro, I couldn't pay much attention to anything, only one or two bits were relatively creepy, some of the special effects were okay I guess, but the story was muddled and nonsense, the pace was slow, and overall I just found it pretty boring, a disappointing horror film. Adequate!"

","Mama is certainly not a Mother's Day gift I would like to present to my mom. Even if she liked horror movies.<br/><br/>While it was nice to have a diverse group of family members in the tired ghost genre as of late, especially involving Jessica Chastain play a different, albeit The Runaways, role, the movie was all over the place with just as many plot holes as the ghost created to teleport.<br/><br/>Even though not seen, but implied nonetheless, the movie opens with violent acts against both family and, sadly, very young children. Father decides that the best method to deal with the recession is to point-blank kill his wife, two infant children and probably himself, but gets interrupted by the title character.<br/><br/>For the next five years, the children are cared for by said ""Mama Ghost"" with a rundown place that never gets cleaned or heck, dusted and fed, incredibly, a diet of rolling cherries of unknown origin or explanation.<br/><br/>Mercifully (or not) for the children, the kids' uncle spends every last dime, and more so, to find them. Only, they bring some deadly baggage with them and are forced to deal with, for the most part, the barely committed punk rocker girlfriend of the Uncle who showed the true meaning of the Evil Stepmother.<br/><br/>Despite the violent ideas in the opening, the movie started off well and continued that way until about the second half where it lost steam, direction and headed right over a cliff of a finale.<br/><br/>I do not believe I have spoiled anything you can't read in a basic synopsis or wouldn't understand had you not seen the movie, but I would really be spoiling a whole lot more if I pointed out all that was wrong with this mess of a screenplay. I can say that most will be raising eyebrows when the end is revealed and one realizes the entire movie could've been over with in mere minutes.<br/><br/>Oh, and get ready for some laugh out bad CGI and ghost movements. People: it's 2013, not 1984. Ghostbusters is absolutely forgiven for the abilities back then. No need to mimic them in today's time.<br/><br/>Send Mama to the Home."

I will admit the cgi could've been better for the ghost because they managed to have awesome cgi for superhero movies(I think Iron Man 3 came out in 2013). The ending was super emotional and wtf-ish. I hated that Lily died. When Mama started pulling her away from Victoria, that's when I realized what she was gonna do and I just started bawling. I hope if they ever make a sequel to this, due to the ending, they call it Lily instead of Mama 2. And I hope the original cast including the girl who played Victoria, even though she's a teenager now. I still can't believe she played Greta in IT"

When the two kids are found, there is no mention of where on earth the dad went, did the girls eat him to survive or did his body just vanish into thin air? Why are the girls, when discovered, acting like sub-human insects skittering about on old furniture?

They were incredible and possibly the creepiest children I have seen on film in a long time.<br/><br/>I feel like the storyline is fresh and something we haven't seen before. While watching the movie I had no idea what was going to happen and how it would end. To me that is the definition of a good horror/thriller movie.

"CMTiago","8","1","3","20 January 2014"," Thrilled and entertained
","These are the two words to describe how I felt watching Mama, and those two adjectives resonate how pleased I was with this film. Horror can be done in flashy style with lots of gore and screaming that rattle your ear drums to exhaustion. Sure the screams are an integral part of this genre, but when done with a touch of mystery, a movie can rise above others as a must see experience that shows what the genre is capable of. The plot is about two children that were abandoned in the woods, where they found a way to survive for 5 years. With their uncle's continuous efforts to find them, eventually the children are rescued and brought home to their relative's care. However they seem to have grown attached to a mysterious entity which they name Mama. This figure will create a lot intense moments and the result is an emotional roller-coaster that will take you to a breathtaking finale. Continuing her string of strong performances, Jessica Chastain once again shows her maturity in a lead role that while not challenging is played with a lot conviction. The child leads reveal their acting abilities as well, as their fears and distrust towards others convey their state of mind quite well. I find Mama to be one of the best in the genre and congratulations are in order to those involved. This movie delivered on what it was supposed to deliver. It thrilled and entertained me."

","A young man (Nicholas Coaster-Waldau), distraught at the 2008 economic collapse, guns down his ex-wife and kidnaps his two young daughters, dragging them to a deserted cabin in the woods, planning to kill them and himself in a horrendous murder/suicide. But before he can enact that horror, he is dispatched by some strange, supernatural force residing in the house. Flash-forward five years when the girls are finally discovered by the killer's twin brother and brought back to civilization, having been ""raised"" by whoever or whatever it is that resides in the place. Needless to say, the girls are a mess psychologically, but that's only half the problem that the uncle and his girlfriend (Jessica Chastain) face in trying to re-acclimate the children to life in the real world.<br/><br/>""Mama"" is a horror movie with a lot of elaborate bells-and-whistles but not a great deal of originality or insight. For beneath all the fancy genre trappings - the creaking boards, the creepy voices on the soundtrack, the half-glimpsed figures in the background, the high-tech CGI effects - it's still just the same old hooey about the spirit who simply can't rest until some personal injustice from the past has been rectified and who believes that scaring the bejeezus out of the living will somehow bring that outcome about.<br/><br/>Yet, despite a really dopey finale, the scare tactics work reasonably well for most of the duration, and the movie succeeds in developing and sustaining a creepy atmosphere thanks to the direction of Andy Muschietti and the cinematography of Antonio Riestra.

"dragokin","5","1","3","2 May 2013"," as far as horror can get
","There were two reasons i watched Mama: The fact that Guillermo del Toro was associated and the main cast. However, del Toro's involvement quickly turned out to be a small scale farce, since he was only one of the producers. So, i was left with the cast and the story.<br/><br/>Jessica Chastain shows again an enviable ability to transform herself. And all Game of Thrones fans will be glad to see Jaime Lanister... i mean Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, playing two characters.<br/><br/>The atmosphere is dark and the scene that should frighten you will be really frightening. Otherwise we're encountering the the typical story about a curse that has to be broken. Meanwhile, our heroes will be harassed by a ghoul.<br/><br/>I'm no big fan of horror (anymore), so i'd just say that Mama plays in the same league as, say, the Scream franchise or the Ring (both Japanese and US versions). Its significance for the genre might be below them, but it is a good horror movie."
"Red_Identity","Null","1","3","26 April 2013"," So flawed but beautiful
","There's so many conflicting emotions I felt about this film. Let's start with the negatives because there were quite a lot. The screenplay needed to be a lot better. Some of the plot developments feel completely forced, and the characters seem to make some truly stupid decisions. I usually overlook this in most horror films, but the fact that I found myself rolling my eyes several times at what the characters were doing is a huge flaw. <br/><br/>Despite the screenplay not being all that good (or maybe decent with just way too many problems), there's an originality to its tone and to its final act that make it stand out among other recent horror films. Sure, it has several jump scares, and for people not a fan of that it might not work. But the jump scares were effective and always seemed creatively executed that it just made up for the other screenplay factors. Despite the writing not being very strong, the central plot here is. The backstory to the ""evil"" is very interesting, and the climax is rather beautiful and very touching.<br/><br/>The other thing that made the film work as much as it did despite being completely problematic is Jessica Chastain. She's already one of my favorite actresses working right now with only a few films that I've seen her in, but there's no sense of naivety or immaturity in her acting. She feels completely in the zone every time I see her in any film and this is no exception. And although the circumstances by which her character becomes the lead is one of the most contrived plot developments in the film, once she's the lead you really don't mind at all. <br/><br/>Overall, the climax bumps my grade up even more. Definitely a creepy film with some truly fantastic visual imagery and a truly fascinating ""villain"" that perhaps warranted a better film, but still works nonetheless."

","Annabel (Jessica Chastain) and Lucas are faced with the challenge of raising his young nieces that were left alone in the forest for 5 years.... but how alone were they? <br/><br/>I am very conflicted on this film. While overall I have to say I liked it, and thought it was one of the better horror films I have seen recently, it is not without its flaws. For one thing, I found Jessica Chastain as a punk rocker a bit hard to swallow (though she pulled it off better than Kristen Stewart trying to be Joan Jett). I also think that they showed the CG a bit too much. Not that it was terrible by CG standards, but one of the keys to a good monster is not showing it...<br/><br/>Those criticisms aside, this was a generally good film. The atmosphere was eerie, there were some good jump scares, the little girls (especially the younger of the two) were phenomenal actresses... and I am pleased they made this PG-13 rather than R because the focus was on the mood and not the language or sexuality (which would be quite inappropriate considering this is still basically a story about kids).<br/><br/>I loved the look of the flashback scene. The style was excellent. Again, I have to bring up the CG -- I would rather they never used any at all, but the people who did it made it look decent. Not perfect, but pretty good. Better than in other contemporary horror or fantasy releases.<br/><br/>The story of the doctor and his searches... that part left me unsure of how I felt. I got the impression that the heart and soul of the story is built around the two girls and the creepiness of the Mama ghost. The doctor seemed like he was added just to push it from a short film to 100 minutes. Not that this is a bad thing, but was it crucial? Was it maybe better as a short film? Hard to say."

","Different of all new terror movies, this one brings many awesome points, beginning from its soundtrack. The main theme is full of mysteries, unsolved in the end, that's the only low point, but it can be fixed with a sequel. The children's roles were incredibly written as their performance, when you see them using many difficult moves. Mama can only express important feelings, cause we got a vengeful ghost keeping good emotions, taking care of two lost girls, even if it interrupts the main couple's life. I can tell easily, that we have here a marvelous mixture, drama and horror. For believers, this movie isn't so fictional at all."

","Mama is a horror film co-written and directed by Andrés Muschietti that stars Jessica Chastain and Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau. The film is based on the Muschietti's Mamá,a Spanish language short film of the same title.<br/><br/>The film deals with the story of two young girls abandoned in a forest cabin, fostered by an unknown entity that they fondly call Mama, which eventually follows them to their new suburban home after their uncle retrieves them. When they are rescued years later and begin a new life, they find that someone or something still wants to come tuck them in at night. The day their father killed their mother, sisters Victoria and Lilly vanished near their suburban neighborhood. For five long years, their Uncle Lucas and his girlfriend, Annabel, have been madly searching for them. But when, incredibly, the kids are found alive in a decrepit cabin, the couple wonders if the girls are the only guests they have welcomed into their home. <br/><br/>It delivers good old fashioned scares without cheap gross-out and even moves us by its surprising and effectively executed lengthy climactic sequence.Also,it is very European in its direction, aesthetic and narrative that it possesses a strong, emotional core that will surprise those jaded by some of the lazier horror titles of late.There are lots of shocks but no real surprises in it.But inspite of the clichés and overly repetitive plot structure,it is a well-played, well-shot horror flick as it doesn't treat audiences as naïve fools.It may not be a masterpiece and it is still worth your time because of it and Chastain's presence in the film."

","Mama begins quickly, showing us how two of our main characters, Victoria and Lilly become separated from the world and why they spend 5 years of their lives living in a deserted cabin in the woods (there's always a cabin isn't there?).<br/><br/>Jessica Chastain plays Annabel, she plays in a band and is completely against having kids. Her boyfriend, played by Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, has been on the search for his two missing nieces ever since they disappeared five years ago. Of course, his hard work pays off and he is finally reunited with the two girls.<br/><br/>Mama is a somewhat old school horror. It's a ghost story that relies on scares and jumps instead of blood and guts or cheap thrills. It's similar to last years The Woman In Black in its use of scares and atmospheric tension. The constant stream of strange noises and its well handled use of special effects help to create very uncomfortable viewing at times.<br/><br/>The scares are simple but very effective. There are some very good scenes, mostly involving Jessica Chastain, which create genuine fright in the audience.<br/><br/>Mama is not without its faults though. There are moments that are meant to scare but instead brought out fits of laughter from the audience, particularly towards the end of the film. There is one moment of note, which I'm sure sounded great in theory, but when put on-screen it can only be compared to resembling cousin ""it"" from The Addams Family.<br/><br/>The good does outweigh the bad though. Chastain is brilliant throughout, the two young girls bring a charm and insecurity to their roles and director Andres Muschietti definitely has a knack for telling an old- fashioned ghost story."

After being found and put back into society under the care of their uncle and his girlfriend, their carers begin to realise someone had been taking care of them all along.<br/><br/>The film is certainly not the scariest film ever; it won't exactly give anyone nightmares. However, there are a few jumpy scenes – but these aren't anything special, this kind of scare is all too common in horror films these days. The story itself is quite interesting; stories of children being cared for by overly protective ghosts appear frequently in TV shows but not so much in films. The story works quite well in feature film length and it doesn't feel too bloated or drawn out. You can tell this is not your average Hollywood horror film; the suspense that builds up works really well and the unconventional ending shows that there is a lot of Spanish/ European horror influence here that has made 'Mama' so unique. <br/><br/>The acting in this film is extremely well done. Jessica Chastain is fantastic here and has proved her skills yet again, this time playing a bass player in a rock band with an attitude. The two little girls also perform really well here – particularly Isabelle Nelisse who played the younger girl, Lilly. <br/><br/>Overall, 'Mama' is a pretty good film with a few decent scares and a plot that goes against boring convention. It's unpredictable, interesting and different from what we usually get."

","""Could have been worse is the only complaint I could give this film other then giving me the chance to see Chastain go even more outside of her comfort zone trying a horror film from producer Guillermo del Toro""<br/><br/>My first film released in 2013 being a January horror film seems strange for me because usually I never try to watch modern horror films because they usually add nothing new to the genre and this is just another example of the horror genre being nothing really. The main plot of the film revolves around two little girls Victoria (Megan Charpentier) and Lilly (Isabelle Nélisse) are abounded by their father and found out in the woods five years later to be taken care by their uncle Lucas (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) and his girlfriend Annabel (Jessica Chastain). The difference with the many years is the girls seem to depend on a spirit called Mama, this one spirit causes many problems for the home which sets up the aim of the film.<br/><br/>As I said above horror movies never bring me to the cinema because they try to scare and none of these attempts ever pay off for me. This film depends on some visual effects to try get the horror jump and I'm sure these scares would have worked better for me if the effects were not truly awful and badly done. The story is quickly told and for a long time we spend our time watching looks into the distant and underscore stopping abruptly. Directed and written by first time feature film director Andrés Muschietti I believe he adds nothing to make this film interesting even when he try's to take a risk and add some visual flourishes to the flat story. I'm sure if I liked horror films I would fall more in love with this film but I cannot handle but laugh at their attempts to scare me.<br/><br/>Oscar nominee Jessica Chastain plays Annabel and she truly as an actress adds so much to nearly every performance she has given on the big screen. It is not one of her greatest performances but still surviving the horror of starring in the film this bad shows the screen talent Chastain has to make every character she plays interesting to listen to and watch. Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau plays both Jeffrey and Lucas and he is not in the film as much as the women in the film, he plays two characters but I kept forgetting he was in the film. Megan Charpentier and Isabelle Nélisse play the little girls in this film and for actresses as young as they are they do a fine job reacting to their unreal surroundings.<br/><br/>A horror movie I accept can never be made different or have any innovation nowadays but still if I was going to watch a horror movie I want to have fun watching it. Chastain deserves better then this film (which she has gotten) but still she shows she has true movie star potential to be the best thing about nearly every movie she is starring in.<br/><br/>MOVIE GRADE: D- (MVP: Jessica Chastain)"

","Victoria and Lily. Two young girls discovered in an abandoned cabin in the woods, far from any other humans. The girls are wild, filthy, and have learned to walk crab-like on all fours. And they claim that while they were out there, they had a guardian MAMA, starring Jessica Chastain (ZERO DARK THIRTY) and Neill Cross, is a far cry from most modern horror films. It's not a slasher film, and the plot is built as much around character and drama as it is scares. There's little blood, and director Andres Muschietti relies upon shadow, careful framing, and the power of the viewer's imagination to generate scares instead of cheap of shocks.<br/><br/>For the most part, it's a winning formula. Ghost stories succeed because of a certain eeriness which other types of scary movies usually lack, and Muschietti wisely devotes a great deal of screen time to building a foreboding sense of mystery around his characters and the situation they find themselves in. And those characters are believable as people, not merely victims-in-waiting. Chastain and Cross are excellent as the young couple struggling to give Victoria and Lily a home after they are rescued from their primitive existence in the forest, and naturally neither they nor the girls' doctor (Daniel Kash) believe the children's stories of ""Mama"" who supposedly took care of them while they were in the forest. Gradually, however, the makeshift family seems invaded by a strange presence, a dark form that comes and goes at will and which only the girls can see.<br/><br/>For the first half of the film, MAMA is gloriously scary. The fear of the alien and unknown is played up to great effect, and there are a number of very subtle but chilling moments when Mama's presence is definitely felt even though nothing is seen. Later, as the film builds towards its somewhat ambiguous yet moving climax, the movie unleashes a barrage of rather artificial computer generated effects that undo a great deal of the underlying mystery. Frankly, Mama is scarier when you can't see her than when you finally can.<br/><br/>MAMA isn't one of the great horror films, but it is worth seeing. It creates a menacing atmosphere that is a world apart from gorier horror films and the storyline is inherently life affirming and a great testament to the value of family and power of love to inspire and surprise us. If you like horror films but don't want to leave the theater splattered with blood, MAMA may serve up the more subtle chills the genre often lacks."
"Jipper2","7","1","3","2 February 2013"," No Pan's Labyrinth but Not Bad Either
","I go into this movie with the recommendation of Guillermo del Toro, director of Pan's Labyrinth. I believe del Toro also ""presented"" the Orphanage when it came out. Since I really enjoyed both Labyrinth & Orphanage, I went to theaters for Mama. Mama never had the feel or felt on the same level as either Pan's Labyrinth or the Orphanage to me. It may have been wrong of me to go into this movie with expectations on such a high level as it's predecessors (so to speak). <br/><br/>I liken Mama more toward the two similar Sam Raimi directed/produced fails (in my opinion) ""Drag Me to Hell"" and ""Possession"". Mama is more similar to the two Raimi tainted movies than the del Toro ones. Where Mama is better than the Raimi movies is that it's actually a horror movie that will get some reaction. I watched all three movies in theaters. Neither Drag me to Hell or Possession got a reaction from the theater crowd. That is unless you count me. I laughed a few times at the ridiculousness. Mama on the other hand was a very similar type of movie but was made well enough to be considered a descent horror film.<br/><br/>My personal reasons with rating this movie only above average is that, there's been numerous movies of it's kind made in recent years. While this one is not bad, it also doesn't stand out with the best either. For my taste they showed the ""evil character"" far too often for it to be scary. Luckily the CGI was just good enough not to ruin the movie or anything but I did see a couple of scenes that looked like they were done just because they could do it. In my personal opinion, wait for video unless you just absolutely want to see it.

","This was a really good horror movie, with plot twists, surprises, plenty of scares, and excellent technical effects. I am not giving it ten stars only because it was a bit depressing in places, but after I left the theater, even the depressing aspects of this movie caused me to think about it.<br/><br/>Once again, Jessica Chastain stole the show. Her acting skills are unbelievable. I just learned from the featured review that she is the critics' favorite, and I can see why. Nobody delivers a line better. So far, I have seen her in two roles, and she aced both of them.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of the horror and sci fi genres, then by all means see this movie."

","Some businessman goes crazy, kills his business partner, goes home, kills the wife, takes his two daughters with him. They crash down a snowy hill and walk in the woods till they find some abandoned hut. He tries to kill himself but doesn't have the guts so he decides to kill his older daughter instead but something grabs him.<br/><br/>Years later, his brother still pays folks to look for his nieces. He is somewhat of a loser, drawing cartoons while his girlfriend is a bass player in a band. Eventually the girls are found and handed to him for custody, although some rich aunt of the girls wants them too. The girls are wild and underdeveloped, especially the younger girl. They do all sorts of creepy stuff at home. Not long after, a ghost has followed them home, a ghost they call Mama. It lives in walls or in large moths. At some point the guy flies down the stairs and ends up in a coma. With him gone this movie is basically all about the ladies- surprise, surprise.<br/><br/>There is some psychiatrist treating the girls who discovers the secret of Mama, she was a nun who had a kid and pursued by the town jumped down a cliff. This movie tries to explain a lot regarding the ghost but fails to explain why she terrorizes people. One good explanation ends up being discarded for some reason. It is a surprisingly scary movie and has a few good jump-out-of-your-seat moments. Chastain's character is excellent, a true rockers chick that doesn't care all that much but will go through a transformation. Chastain herself looks lovely here. The performances are very strong in particular of the older girl, Megan Charpentier. Direction is good but flawed. The look is of your typical Spanish ghost story- overly gray. With this cast and crew and the good basics of a story a lot more could have been done and better."
"kubo600","8","1","3","27 January 2013"," Simply the creeps !
","First of all, I would like to describe how my feeling was when it was surprised by the outlook of Mama. To be honest, she was a patient with mental problem who tried to protect her child at all cost, which gave me a thought that those so-called abnormal people have a sense of keeping their ""creatures"" safe. That was emphasized at the time the mother's face was showed off. She looked not so beautiful, which some times made me consider she was a martyr. As a result, that her soul had not been released (or rest-in-peace) turned her to be a ghost had a freaky face, of course, thrilled all the audiences at any time.<br/><br/>Next, the director had created a simple script yet touch. It was a homicide, in my opinion, let a ""pre-Mama"" woman to the end of the rope and, by accident, led to the unexpected tragedy: she did not die completely. In addition, after five years of seeking those missed nephews, a nearly-comes-to-spouse couple not only did not let them go painfully, but also gave them a special care, which partially was felt by the kids. It was a thoughtful and touching the tears dropped as well as the last scene brought me. It could not be forgotten easily.<br/><br/>Thumbs up for actors! Especially Annabel (Jessica Chastain) and Vitoria (Megan Charpentier). The bond linked them seemingly became stronger by and by for which audiences feel gradually from the start. That Jessica Chastain had made it one Annabel with a little of chaos yet a warm-heart inside, which was proved by the time she had to make a decision about her boyfriend and the two creepy kids of his, conjured me up to the image of the step-mother as a rock star! For Victoria, whatever if it was a result of her older-age, she, granted , had made a good choice: to stay with her real family instead of Mama. It was easy to understand that her attitude toward the new family, who seemed strange to her for the first time, was improved slowly alongside what they got through together. It was a changing progress from disgusting to harmony condition for them both.<br/><br/>To sum up, it is quite hard for me to get Mama out of my mind. Truly obsession as it is, Mama now gets one job: to give the creeps to the world (in theater) !!!"

","3 out of 4 B+<br/><br/>Mama continues the happy trend of Horror masters mentoring little monster directors so as to let loose their cinematic spawn upon the world. It's a pretty good system ( it gave us last years underrated Sam Rami backed ""The Possession) and it allows us to get another Guillermo Del Toro project as the wait for Pacific Rim becomes increasingly unbearable. Though this one, unlike the underwhelming ""Don't be Afraid of the Dark"" has flashes of auterism. Andy Musichietti expanding his original 2 and a half minute Spanish language short has crafted a truly gorgeous looking movie that headily juxtaposes cool florescent interiors and trim sharp stylized wood exteriors. I'd say that this modest little film rivals Skyfall, Life of Pi, and Beasts of the Southern Wild as the best looking film of the last 12 months. He builds some excellent scenes (though toward the end it start bordering on self parody with it's large quantity of silly jump scares) and there are two ones that remind me of John Landis ( A chilling dream sequence) and vintage Steven Spielberg ( An quietly frightening sequence involving a blanket). He get's fine performances out of the two cute young girls and brings out a fun performance from Jessica Chastain. He could have used help on the script (which he wrote with his sister and another collaborator) that relies on a bunch of clichéd dialogue and rushed concepts ( the girls transition back to normledom, while well directed, feels really skimped over). But I believe that Musichietti, whom I'd like to see move on from silly horror movies to serious fare, has the chops and distinct and separate style to hit it big. I'll be watching him in the years to come. And overall it's a pretty creepy movie but the very loud teenage girl audience I saw it with seemed terrified so maybe you will be to."
"zeetoddy","7","1","3","19 January 2013"," A Gem
","This little horror movie is a gem. I didn't expect much, but when my ten year old niece was excited to watch it I decided to see it. Apparently younger folks knew all about this, but I didn't. It is a simple story. A father murders his wife and goes on the run with his kids. His car crashes. He walks to a deserted cabin in the woods with his two girls. It is there that mama appears when he tries to kill his children. Mama is a ghostly caretaker. She is the ghost of a woman who jumped to her death in the 1800's. She cares for the two girls for several years before they are found (she did away with the murderous father). The father's brother is searching for the kids and when he finds them he brings them home. However, mama comes home with them as well. I haven't seen a good horror film like this is years. For the most part it is understated. You only see glimpses of mama until the end of the movie. The creepiest part is how the younger daughter has not acquired social skills. She is literally an animal and walks on all fours. Unlike many horror films, the characters are intelligent and don't go around opening doors they shouldn't. The flashbacks give mama her back story. There are a few unexplained things such as the children surviving on gathered cherry pits and moths, but nonetheless it is interesting. Definitely see this movie. It's on the top of my list for a thriller."
"cory-huff3897","7","1","3","19 January 2013"," Mama - A slightly flawed yet effective ghost story
","Annabel is not ready to be a mother. She's a bass player in a punk rock band, she's dating Lucas, who is a starving artist as well, and she thanks the lord above that she's not pregnant. But on that same morning of reassurance that an impending pregnancy won't interrupt her rebellious and free-spirited life, Lucas gets the call that his nieces have been discovered in a cabin in the woods. Five years prior, they disappeared with their father after he killed their mother, and have survived by developing into feral creatures. Lucas, and a begrudging Annabel, fight in court to get custody of the socially handicapped little girls despite the fact that their therapist, Dr. Dreyfuss, doesn't think either of them are fit to be parents. But the alternative is the girls go with their only other family member, a great aunt that lives on the opposite coast, so he strikes a deal. He'll move them all into a house the hospital uses for transitioning families, all expenses paid, as long as he can continue to examine the girls. They begin to settle into their new lives as the girls come further and further out of their shell, only to discover that the girls are as alone in their bedrooms at night as they were in the woods.<br/><br/>Mama is a full-length adaptation of a two-minute film, both written and directed by Andres Muschietti. The film was so strong that Guillermo del Toro tasked the Spaniard with expanding the minimalistic narrative into a feature that is as scary and atmospheric as its inspiration. And I'm happy to say that, for the most part, he succeeded.<br/><br/>First of all are the negative aspects. All of the clichés are alive and well in Mama. Flickering lights, late night explorations sans flashlights or logic, characters that explain aspects of the story to come and then disappear, cheap jump scares rear their ugly head, and orchestral swells and crescendos dictate when to be scared. Mama doesn't make any attempts to reinvent the proverbial wheel of horror.<br/><br/>The good news is that all flaws aside, Mama ends up being very scary and surprisingly touching. Jessica Chastain fully commits to her role as Annabel and proves why she is one of today's rising stars. The development of her maternal instincts and emotional journey are wholly believable, and her chemistry with the two girls is excellent. Megan Charpentier and Isabelle Nelisse, as Victoria and Lilly, turn in equally believable and touching performances as two girls trying to find their place between their adopted and spiritual mothers. Neither one of them is tasked with easy jobs as the psychologically damaged children, but both of them succeed in being reasonably creepy and disarmingly innocent. The girls also provide some needed humor that is well timed to diffuse some tension and then serves ratchet it right back up. The real star of the show though is Mama herself. While she is more CGI than practical effects, Mama still makes for an effective creature that moves like a tortured marionette. And thanks to a disturbing back story, she also makes for a ghostly villain you can empathize with on some levels. She is not just your average boogey (wo)man.<br/><br/>The cinematography in Mama is astounding at times. A lot of horror films utilize quick camera cuts and edits to provide scares or reveal what scares await off screen. But Muschietti goes through a lot of trouble to keep the camera rolling and keeping the characters in frame, which goes a long way to building the tension. There is a roughly 5 minute long tracking shot at the end of the 2nd act that is relentlessly intense. Mama also creates one of the most atmospheric and moving nightmare sequences in recent memory. And even if the flickering lights and dark hallways have all been seen before, they are still well lit and utilized. <br/><br/>For what it's worth, Mama doesn't get everything right. There are plot holes abound, side characters are forgotten as fast as they're introduced, and the clichés are as present as they've ever been. But I urge you to look past the flaws and give Mama a chance. The scares are efficient and well earned without feeling too cheap. The principal characters are well developed and easy to empathize with when the terror hits, including ""mama"" herself. I walked in expecting a few halfway decent scares, but I found myself drawn in to a deep and oddly moving ghost story. Will Mama be remembered ten years from now? In all likelihood, no it won't. But while you're watching it makes for one hell of a frightening ride.<br/><br/>I would score Mama as a 7 out of 10."

Typically, I wouldn't watch horror but my friend insisted on it, so I thought of giving it a chance. Don't get me wrong though, I watched a lot of horror movie when I was younger.<br/><br/>Everything went as expected of a horror movie until the very end. That's when the movie went from a 6.5 to 2 for me. In the end, out of the two little girls, only one survived. In fact, it is the youngest one because she has less memory of being human. The story portraits Mama as not too much of bad ghost, but more of a loving but selfish one. In the end, the story turned out unexpectedly. The selfish Mama decided to take the life of the youngest kid.<br/><br/>Come on, people!! What's wrong with the society nowadays? Is it true that all we care about is entertainment? This story is extremely immoral. The ghost, Mama is a relatively logical ghost. She understand love and yet chose to take the life of a kid. The kid has a bright future, give her chance and give yourself a chance to redeem for your karma, MAMA!!!! No matter what the reason is, it is extremely immoral for an adult to take a life of a kid (even if they ask for it). Honestly, I don't care if the adults die but not the kids. I am truly sick with the outcome. What is wrong with everyone living a happy life after? Anyways, perhaps my work is a bit tiring and therefore I prefer movies that bring hopes to others. If you are like me, DO NOT watch this movie because you will get scared, sad and angry about the immoral outcome of this movie."

","This is a film with an identity crisis. It tries to be a horror film complete with jump scares and the usual horror elements, but Mama doesn't generate any chills or thrills. The titular character isn't frightening at all and we see way too much of her. The film should have alluded to her presence more, rather than showing her in all of her CGI glory. The middle hour of this film is incredibly contrived and convoluted and filled with cheap jump scares that overexpose the films villain. Mama also throws in a bit of dark fantasy and actually succeeds more with these moments. The last 10 minutes are beautiful and I wanted the rest of the film to match the finales visual and tonal poetry. I also think the film would have worked better in a period setting, which I felt similarly about in another Guillermo Del Toro production, ""Don't Be Afraid of the Dark"". So, if they tightened up the script, used a more subtle approach to it's monster and embraced it's dark fantasy potential Mama could have been great."

","Greetings again from the darkness. Ever since The Blair Witch Project and the influence of ""found footage"", which then transitioned into the endless sequels for Paranormal Activity, true creativity and ingenuity has been mostly lacking from the horror genre. One of those still devoted to creeping us out and generating seat jumping is Guillermo del Toro, who produced this film after seeing writer/director Andres Muschietti's three minute short film.<br/><br/>Since the real joy in experiencing a horror film comes from the surprises and twists, very few details will be revealed here. Worth noting is the lead role of Annabel played by the incredibly talented Jessica Chastain. Yes, the same one who is currently nominated for her role in Zero Dark Thirty. This time out, Ms. Chastain is a tatted up bass player in a (lousy) punkish band and sporting a Joan Jett hairdo. Annabel is living a bohemian lifestyle (translation: nearly starving with no responsibilities) with her artist boyfriend Lucas, played by Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, whom many will recognize from Game of Thrones, and who appeared in the superb Headhunters (one of my favorites of 2012).<br/><br/>Many horror film clichés are presented here including a cabin in the woods, a portal to the afterlife, buzzing bugs, unexplained lullaby singing through the air vents, an untimely ""fall"" down the stairs by a key character and ties to a long ago tragedy that holds the key to this current mess. Notable is the welcome absence of gross out and gore-out special effects. Despite the clichés, Muschietti and his co-writing sister Barbara, and Neil Cross provide us with some new touches (uncovering maternal instincts) and such a great looking movie that our attention is firmly held ... especially for the first 80%. As happens so frequently, the final act is a bit disappointing, but not enough to ruin the experience.<br/><br/>Chastain is top notch here. Coaster-Waldau is underutilized. The two young girls are effectively portrayed by Megan Charpentier (Victoria) and Isabelle Nelisse (Lily). In fact, Lily scampering about on all fours may be as frightening as the spooky Mama, played by 7 foot actor Javier Botet. It's an unconventional horror film with an atypical ending, and certainly worth a look if you are a fan of the genre."

","I tend to avoid horror movies but something about this one made me go see it. It was rated PG-13 and some reviews I had read said there wasn't much gore. There isn't. The horror of it is psychological. There are some instances were Mama jumps out and scares another cast member. I screamed a few times in the movie. The little girl Lily, was a source of laughter throughout the movie in the theatre I saw it in. She was like a little animal since she was only one years old when they were left alone. People seemed to find that funny, although I don't think it was supposed to be. I expected more to come of the hypnotizing and mental issues that Victoria, the older daughter was experiencing. I thought the ending was pretty good although it did not turn out like I had expected. Mama, albeit in a non-human existence, had developed a relationship with Lily that was quite bizarre.<br/><br/>I thought the acting by the little girls was quite good and the figure of Mama was ghastly.

","Mama is an unfortunate misfire, a film that's too contrived to be called effective and truly scary. The grim fairy tale aspect of the film just didn't work for me at all and the story though intriguing, sad and startling in the beginning, became scattered and not focused on which direction to take. The CGI ghost was horrible and unintentionally laughable, I rolled my eyes every time it came popping on screen, in a horror movie that is not a good sign. The scares were nothing new and way too predictable and the characters were underdeveloped that there was not much connection to care. Mama could have been one of 2013's scariest horror films, but its solid potential melted away as fast as The Wicked Witch Of The West from The Wizard of Oz.<br/><br/>The performances are the best part of this teetering film, even if the script fails them. Jessica Chastain who plays Annabel, is probably the hardest working actress of today, she gives her all to her roles even if it's as thin as this. She always brings a sense of empowerment mixed with vulnerability to her roles that is always compelling to watch. The real stars of this picture are the child actors Megan Charpentier and Isabelle Nelisse who play Victoria and Lilly, orphaned girls that were found living in an abandoned cottage in the woods for years after their dad goes missing and mother dead. Their performance in the movie had so many layers that add some depth to their roles and were engaging, spooky and heartbreaking. I see them as future stars in this business.<br/><br/>Director, Andrés Muschietti who also created the short film Mama that started it all, definitely knows what a horror movie should look like and crafted a haunting atmosphere filled with grotesque images and nightmarish shadows and lighting. The director just doesn't quite know what a scary film should act like, he seems to have a lot of solid ideas and an semi original premise, but somehow got lost from the journey to paper to film. Andres Muschietti has so much potential as a horror movie director; he just needs to create a better script and a more balanced story. Mama just fell short of becoming truly great.<br/><br/>Overall, Mama just wasn't terrifying as one might think. It had fine performances, a startling and fresh premise, some creepy moments, but the CGI ghost was asinine, the scares dull and ineffective and has an unconvincing ending. AN HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!"

","Mama is like a walk down memory lane, but when I say ""walk,"" I employ the word more like a trudge and by ""memory lane"" I mean the lane of rehashed ideas. Certainly a gifted performance by Jessica Chastain, one of the strongest female character actors working today, and some delightful atmospheric shots buoy it to a more watchable level, but this is a basic tutorial suspense filmmaking in 2013. And by ""basic tutorial"" I mean Cliff Notes.<br/><br/>I suppose for the least-demanding, Mama works as a completely serviceable diversion from life's tribulations. We begin by seeing a distraught man named Jeffrey, who, in the wake of losing nearly everything in the bitter financial crisis of 2007, kills his business partners, kills his wife, and then takes his two small children (a three year old and a one year old) out to a remote cabin to kill them too.<br/><br/>They survive a crash after Jeffrey drives recklessly on a road covered with snow, and proceed to take shelter in a rundown cabin. Just as Jeffrey is about to pull the gun on the children when a demonic figure attacks him and kills him almost instantly. Five years later, they are found by Lucas (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau), Jeffrey's brother and his wife Annabel (Jessica Chastain), his wife. Both children are severely ill, savage, and appear to be haunted by a figure they call ""mama."" Annabel agrees to take them in and try to give them a safe, viable haven, but as we all know, these children are seriously not right and they rightfully belong in a private institution. But don't worry; she's got this.<br/><br/>It's no wonder why Mama is January-fare; it is practically a poster-child for why the horror genre is such a disappointing venture today. Everything is inclusive here from creepy children, to eerily offputting home, to brave woman at the center, to foreseeable jump scares that have continued to not pose much of an effect on me. There comes a time when techniques tread from seriousness to self-parody and all of those techniques have well walked past the boundaries of self-parody and are almost entering the territory of being laughable.<br/><br/>Chastain is a terrific woman, who has already made herself marketable, being featured in projects from The Help to Zero Dark Thirty. Here, she is simply left with not much to do, and all we get is a blank character with an attractive Goth look and a big enough heart to allow two unhealthy children in her home. The other characters we get are pretty archetypal; either victims or redundant creepy caricatures. The two little girls, while seemingly decent young talents, scared me about as much as your average Scooby-Doo episode.<br/><br/>Mama benefits from Andy Muschietti's smooth, conservative camera-work that takes something of a less-is-more approach to the material, before quickly abandoning it in the later acts and some interesting musical choices to alleviate the environment and surroundings. Yet it includes many clichés that simply can not go overlooked, even when the aesthetic material is above average. And by ""includes"" I mean ""is plagued by.""<br/><br/>Starring: Jessica Chastain, Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, Megan Charpentier, Isabelle Nélisse, and Daniel Kash. Directed by: Andy Muschietti."

I had no idea what was going to happen and not hints on the premise so I can say that this is about as truthful as a review can get:<br/><br/>Mama<br/><br/>Now the premise of Mama is a very interesting one. Two girls are abandoned in the woods as children and get nurtured by a strange being simply known as Mama. They are raised in this habitat for years until the uncle of the children finally finds them and takes them back with him. Mama is thought to be a split personality of the eldest girl though this is of course not true. This is an interesting plot in my opinion.<br/><br/>The movie does do some things very well. For the most part; the first 45 minutes of the movie are interesting while not necessarily scary. Definitely a little bit creepy but nothing too creepy. The main characters (thank goodness) are likable. This is probably what saves this movie from being just average is the fact that the main characters are likable. Most horror movies as of late have boring main characters who you wouldn't care if they lived or died but these characters I was actually concerned for. The leading female does a pretty good job overall along with her boyfriend/husband (I'm honestly not quite sure if it ever officially says what their status is). Now let's talk about the scares.<br/><br/>As far as scares go this movie doesn't do too much. The Mama is definitely creepy and of course there are some jump scares but overall she isn't that frightening. Ever good horror fan knows that the less of the monster/ghost/being you see the scarier the movie is. This worked for the first 45 minutes of the movie because you never really got to see her full form. However then the movie falls into the biggest problem of every horror movie: the main threat isn't frightening. I know a lot of people complained about the CGI making Mama not so intense but it didn't bother me too much. Sure it wasn't the greatest but it wasn't as bad as Insidious. What really made it lame was that the movie starts to show what she actually looks like in the open and then the audience starts to realize... oh... that's not so scary... it's just a lady with a HERP DERP face. This movie would've been so much better if Mama hadn't gotten so much screen-time. <br/><br/>Though I will say that the kids were pretty creepy at times. The weirdest thing in this movie is that the kids at the beginning are CGI. Seriously, the kids are simply CGI kids, but then in the next scene they aren't. It's weird and I was curious why they had to do that. However the littlest kid (Lily) is definitely freaky and she actually made this movie a lot creepier than what it would've been. The way she prowls around like an animal put me on edge a couple of times. One small problem that is movie seems to have along with a lot of recent horrors is that there is always a goofy scene that is trying too hard to be scary but ends up being hilarious. Trust me... when you watch this movie you will know what scene I am talking about.<br/><br/>Another slight problem with this movie is that there is a random aunt in the movie that does nothing to affect the plot yet she is supposed to be mildly important. I found this weird because the movie was building up to a conflict with her but it turns out that... well... it wasn't even slightly important to the movie.<br/><br/>The appearance of Mama is rather inconsistent which really bothered me. In the beginning of the movie she appears as more of a ""multi-limbed plant monster"" where we definitely see her with at least fours arms if not six. But then later in the movie her appearance changes from the one that was already established which seemed like an odd choice since he original appearance was actually really cool. I wish we would've seen a bit more of her original version.<br/><br/>All in all Mama isn't a bad horror but it isn't a really good one either. There are a lot concepts here that I thought were interesting but they just weren't applied right. The movie could've been soooooo much better if it weren't for all of the problems it has. The first 45 minutes are good, but after that it just goes down hill. The finale of the movie isn't scary in the slightest and starts to turn into a certain scene from Harry Potter.<br/><br/>6.5/10"

But then the charm of Jessica Chastain and Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau in Universal's widely successful Guillermo del Toro horror film made the film even better. I didn't give it a 10 because I would've made the ending a lot scarier, but the film had an honest ending, and the audience deserved that. I think that everything right up to the ending was wonderful. I like a horror film that makes me nervous, not knowing what the ending will do. And the scene where Lily was pulling on the blanket was brilliant. Everyone should enjoy certain aspects of this drama, so the 6.2 star rating was cruel, and further proves that many IMDb users are harsh. This film took $20 million to make and earned $71 million. If the show was a loser, it would've never made it to the $71 million mark. And now I see it plays on TV regularly, so the viewership ratings and advertising revenue income says something about a film's followed. Cable stations don't make money from loser films."

","Based on the success of the short, Guillermo del Toro presents this feature length version of Andy Muschietti's vision. First off, the 15 certificate filled me with foreboding. When are we going to start seeing horror 18's again! But saying that this film does have it's fair share of jumps, throw in to the mix a spirit who's 'Grudge' like noises definitely creeped me out and will make me check my closet before going to sleep his evening. the film follows two young girls who are abandoned in a cabin in the woods by their estranged father for 6 years before their uncles efforts to find them succeed. <br/><br/>They are rescued and taken in by their uncle and his reluctant girlfriend but who has been looking after them all this time? I was fairly impressed with the overall aesthetics of this movie and it confirms my suspicions that Europeans are indeed the masters of horror. Yes this is technically a remake, but a remake of the directors own short film made 6 years previous and not a pointless scareless rehash that seems popular in the states of late. Muschietti's ability to take us on a journey through the eyes of not just Annabel but also of the two young girls was expertly driven, normally kids in movies make me reach for the remote to change channel but these two were fantastic. <br/><br/>Jessica Chastain's portrayal of Annabel was very believable as a woman not ready for the burden of motherhood but she carries the role exceedingly well and the film is as much her journey as that of the kids and of the 'what' that has been looking after them.<br/><br/>Watch it if you were disappointed with Drag me to Hell or Don't be Afraid of the Dark as this is far better"

"violajunerose","6","0","1","7 June 2016"," Spoiler Alert! Great movie but..stick to the script
","This review contains one or two spoilerish statements. Look, I loved this movie. I loved the visuals, I loved the way it was sympathetic to the ghost (because ghosts are people too). But I have to foul it because my two most hated tactics were used far too liberally:<br/><br/>1. Using the movie's description to explain the movie's plot. ""The stock market crashes and a distraught father kills his employees and his wife then turns the gun on his daughters""....am I the only one who saw absolutely none of this actually IN the movie and, having not read the write-up, was left wondering....why in the name of creation did this dude up and try to kill his kids? Also, if this movie is set during the stock market crash of the 1920's, which it certainly looks like in the beginning, why is it that five years later the girls' uncle is wandering around the current era? A little continuity would have been nice, especially for those of us who love period clothing. <br/><br/>2. Using the storyboard to tell the story. The 11 minutes of children's drawings at the beginning were utterly pointless. I could have done without the scene where dad drives the girls off a cliff, finds some cabin, and tries to kill his kids by shooting them in the head, too. Realistically, if the movie had started with the brother trying to find his nieces and just EXPLAINING to his girlfriend that they had gone missing, nothing would be lost. Except a lot of confusion. <br/><br/>The CGI was cool and I really loved the mini actress who played Victoria. She had a great range but unfortunately, couldn't carry off the entire plot by herself. The brother is missing from 80% of the plot and it seems like he's only there to show us that....to....I have no idea. It's pretty clear that the actor doesn't know why he's there either. I don't think it's his fault that he has like 11 lines and none of them further the movie in the slightest. At least he got more lines than dad, who has one, spoken in a weird dream the brother has about him: another scene the movie could have done without. <br/><br/>This movie seems to be ""about"" the girls' stepmom, the contrast between her and mama. At the end of the movie, I ended up feeling sorry for the kid who went with her instead of the ghost, since throughout the movie she proves herself to be an unemployed, irresponsible, self-absorbed and generally uncaring addict. Literally the worst mother imaginable. If this movie was going for my heartstrings, it missed. <br/><br/>I feel like ""mama"" was the only sympathetic character. And they killed HER off before the movie even started. The end result was a movie that is also a bad joke. What happens when a Canadian and Spanish film maker get together? The story is overly complicated, overly emotional, disjointed, and too long."

","Welcome to the Hollywood big cliché (although with crappy CGI more often than not). Here you shall not find creativity, horror or imaginative writing. The acting is alright, pity that it doesn't save you from the lame story. The ending tries to be some sort of bitter sweet sentimental nonsense and, allow me to repeat myself, the CGI is laughable, most of the times. Hell, even the prosthetics are bad. I found myself laughing and smirking when the movie show us the girls running around in their fours at the beginning, when we discover the (supposedly) scary entity or with the priceless scene of the crawling wig. Honestly, is this a Disney production? I watched one of those parody movies before this (can't remember if it was Scary Movie 5 or what) and they are both competing for the title of most stupid comedy. The spoof could have taken scenes from the original directly and you wouldn't notice the difference.<br/><br/>A very annoying issue is that, lacking any real scary moments, the movie tries to do the cheap trick many other bad ""horror"" movies insist on pulling: use a sudden change in the volume of the soundtrack - due to the very low volume of the conversations, a sudden extremely loud noise will surely make your ears bleed; at least some reaction from the viewers, since the silly attempts to scare the audience like this will fail miserably. Unless you are in kindergarten, perhaps.<br/><br/>Alas, completely forgettable movie."

I recommend for beginners or those children who think they're ready for scary movies.

","""Mama"" (2013) was quite good; I'd give it an 8 out of 10. Jessica Chastain does a great job with a well written character arc — initially unlikable, but then a surprising heroine. And it's great that she got top billing, instead of the film's obligatory telegenic male protagonist, who actually spends a lot of time off-screen.<br/><br/>Guillermo del Toro actually didn't direct this, as I thought — he was the executive producer. The director and screenwriter was Andrés Muschietti. But I swear this has the feel of del Toro's work. It could stand as a thematic sequel to the wonderful ""Don't Be Afraid of the Dark"" remake, for example, which had strong elements of childhood fantasy and motherhood as a theme.<br/><br/>And what a great and beautifully creepy use of CGI to render the title baddie. In fact, the whole movie was visually terrific, with a fairy-tale-ish use of movement and color that was cool, creative and different. There are really clever flourishes for fright-flick fans — I personally really liked the tug-of-war scene.<br/><br/>I occasionally noticed some plot-convenient mysteries  one character is assaulted but survives? And ""Mama"" can move with either lightning speed or plodding slowness, depending on what the story calls for. And  at one point  do we actually have a zombie? Do we need to call on Rick Grimes and his band of survivors from ""The Walking Dead?""<br/><br/>This was fun. Check it out.<br/><br/>https://ericrobertnolan.wordpress.com/"

","Mama presents an enticing story and has several scary moments. However, it also has an unlikely plot with some overused (yet underdeveloped) clichés and too many characters, resulting in serious plot holes. Besides, the conclusion really sucks.<br/><br/>The first two-thirds are by far the best. Like so many horror movies, Mama is better at building suspense than at solving it in a coherent whole. The monster is originally made in comparison with most ghost flicks and scary enough but only as long as it is hinted at -- as soon as it is fully displayed it looks weird and almost funny.<br/><br/>Recommended only for those having no problem in belief suspension, or for women interested in the dramatic line underlying the main plot."

","'Mama' is the latest horror movie to receive a reasonable budget. That may raise it slightly above the hundreds of other B-movies out there, but the problem - in my opinion - is that is simply follows the typical (modern) horror structure.<br/><br/>This is as follows... Creepy things start to happen to a family (mainly the children). The adults put it down to a rational explanation and call the police. The police do nothing. Slowly the adults except that something supernatural is happening. They seek advice from a convenient expert in the field. They confront the horror at the end of the film.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Mama follows this narrative structure to the letter. Yes, it is well shot. Yes, there are some 'jumpy' moments and yes the overall vibe is slick, well-produced and a bit creepy. But, at the end of the day, it's nothing that seasoned horror fans (which I'm including me in) haven't seen a hundred times before.<br/><br/>It's certainly a decent offering in the horror genre, but it might be nice for film-makers to try something a little more out of the norm.<br/><br/>http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/"

","I've seen this movie 3 times now. I even saw the 3 minute short that came with the DVD with different actors playing the children as well as a commentary. Normally I can't stand children in movies but this movie had some very endearing little girls - 2 sets for 2 girls 5 years apart. I must admit Morgan McGarry who played the 3 year-old Victoria was the cutest thing I ever saw with those spectacles of hers that made her seem very vulnerable. She only lasted a few minutes into the beginning of the movie but still had an impact on me. She was even super cute with her car coat and hood on from the back as she was walking through the woods with her hand in her father's hand. Very touching moment - and believe me I don't get all squishy with kids in movies. The only way I like kids is barbecued so these children were very special.<br/><br/>The older Lilly played by Isabelle Nélisse grew on me near the end with that incredible smile of hers when it was obvious that she was more enchanted with Mama than with Annabelle.<br/><br/>The story line was different but no better or worse than any other ghost story I've ever seen and this one was at least original in many respects. I was glad that the steady cam was steady as most steady cam operators seem to be born with a tremor of some kind so you walk out of the theater with a bad case of the spins.<br/><br/>This movie was tailor made for CGI as it produced an interesting ghost that changed shape - and color sometimes - in almost every sequence it was in. Also the ghost wasn't predictable every time it appeared.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the way that the older Victoria slowly endeared herself to Jessica Chastain's character Annabelle and how Chastain tried her best to be close to both girls even though the younger sister Lily was much more difficult for her. There was a coincidence that made the story easier to deal with such as Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau who played both twin brothers Lucas Desange and Jeffrey Desange. That made it much easier and actually more enjoyable to see him bond almost instantly with Victoria as Lilly was obviously going to be more difficult.<br/><br/>Look for Daniel Kash as Dr. Gerald Dreyfuss who played Spunkmeyer in Aliens!! It was a nice blast from the past."

If a bit more money had been spent on the CGI (or what ever effect was used) and the spook had looked more 3 dimensional this movie would have got a 9 from me.

","Well done in the heretofore Japanese fashion (which has been co-opted in recent years by filmmakers from every corner of the globe), MAMA teeters on the brink of excellence: it's well-crafted, with good music and sound effects, and a decent enough storyline. There are some genuinely creepy scenes (the youngest girl crawling around on all fours is startling), but the cgi- yet again- gum up the works when they are needed least- at film's end. Drama goes right out the window once the cgi start; lacking credibility (they LOOK like what they are: cheesy computerized effects), they yank the rug right out from under the viewer.

","Finding their long-abandoned nieces after years in the wild, a man and his girlfriend learn the ghostly guardian the girls invented to watch over them is a real spirit and must try to save themselves from the supernatural threat.<br/><br/>This turned out to be quite a nice if somewhat clichéd offering that has some rather decent moments to it. One of the main problems to go on here is the fact that the film makes no sense about what kind of woman the guardian really is. Some of the time, it appears as a regular, plain old ghost haunting the family and attacking them or just playing with the children, but there's other times where the figure is made out to be an otherworldly demon trying to access our world through the spreading-fungus-like holes in the wall that seem to be set-up in order to harvest souls around the house, which comes off nicely in giving us some scares but really has little purpose in explaining the story. As well, the film tends to meander in completely uninteresting scenarios, with the vindictive grandmother trying to get the girls under her custody and not trusting the couple to do so merely for her own good or the sentimentality of slowly winning over the younger, more feral sister with motherhood tactics she'd never prepared for before, which is a plausible intuition from the storyline but really comes off as tired and cliché from the continued usage of the tactic in other movies. Beyond that, the kid-friendly rating is a detriment in keeping all the potential deaths and violence almost always off-camera or shrouded in darkness to really keep us from seeing anything interesting, and the constant materializing of the ghost beyond the unknowing character for a scare gets old the third time it happens. However, there's some good things here, including the rather ominous way it builds up in intensity towards the ghost actually attacking with the games with the children, mistaking it for the girls or simply using the fungus-like holes in the walls to spread the fear, and with it being such a creepy-looking creature in it's own right generates some very chilling sequences in the later half when it's finally on the warpath after the family. These here really save it from the rather pedestrian and lackluster offering it could've been.<br/><br/>Rated PG-13: Mild Violence, Language and children-in-jeopardy."

The girls get psychological help from Dr. Dreyfuss (Daniel Kash) and a battle for custody begins, between Lucas and the girls aunt Jean. (Jane Moffat) Lucas is unmarried, and his girlfriend, Anabel (Jessica Chastain) plays bass. Remarkably, Lucas and Anabel gain custody of the girls, and Dr. Dreyfuss continues his treatment of the girls. The doctor finds out from Victoria that a woman named Mama helped the girls survive during their five year ordeal, but the psychologist thinks that Mama was a coping mechanism.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Lucas is hospitalized after falling down the stairs, and that leaves Anabel alone in the house with the girls. Then Anabel starts hearing noises in the house. Is Mama a coping mechanism for two abandoned children? Or something else entirely? <br/><br/>The premise of this movie starts out a little shaky, young children abandoned in a cabin for five years. Kids abandoned for five years would be dead, and there are standard horror conventions, spooky cabin, suburban house, strange noises, and the movie seems to telegraph its punches, I knew when the horror was coming and that made it less scary. But the story held my interest, at least until the reveal, partially because children telling a scary story is always more scary than adults telling a scary story.The ending is somewhat corny, but overall, it was a pretty good movie.<br/><br/>What made me like this movie so much? Jessica Chastain was excellent in in a really different role for her, she was a rock n' roll chick in this film, complete with tats, very different from Zero Dark Thirty or The Debt. Yet, gradually when she meets these girls, she becomes incredibly materialistic, and seeks to protect these girls from whatever is bothering them. The transformation was very believable. The little girls are incredibly creepy, especially the younger one, and that adds to the suspense. Daniel Kash kept me guessing as the psychologist, it was a really interesting performance. So here is a case where strong performances overcome a somewhat weak and predictable story.<br/><br/>Mama didn't raise no fool. To find out why, visit my blog reviewswithatude.wordpress.com"
"jwaugh-ethics","5","0","1","6 November 2013"," Good scares, lack of everything else for the most part.
","I think it is hard for me to review a horror film. Much like comedy, horror depends on it ability to elicit a specific reaction from its viewer, and sometimes it seems as if this reaction is dependent on the viewers own tastes, or perhaps the state that they are in. I found Mama to be truly terrifying at times (even though the horror tapers off at the end), and I suspect that most viewers will feel some of the fear that I did. Unfortunately, most of the terror is balanced with a dumb story, characterless characters, and a tendency to show too much toward the end.<br/><br/>""Mama"" is the story of two sisters found in a cabin in the woods after being lost for years. Their father had brought them to the cabin after killing his wife, and planned to murder the children along with killing himself. He never gets the chance though, as he is soon dispatched by a mysterious entity. The uncle of the children, Lucas (Coster-Waldau), has kept up hope of finding his brother and the children, eventually a group of hunters he hires to comb the woods finds the children alive but feral. After some pop psychology, they move in with their uncle and his girlfriend, Annabel (Chastain), where it soon becomes apparent that some malevolent force has followed the children out of the woods.<br/><br/>One of the better aspects of the film is the relationship between the two sisters. The older sister, Victoria, is able to more readily adapt back into normal life and drop her previous feral attitude. She also becomes more attached to her adopted family, and more wary of the entity that the two sisters refer to as ""Mama."" Her younger sister, however, is more unwilling to adapt to modern life and sees Mama as a protective and motherly force, drawn to it instinctively almost. This sets up a lot of what happens in the film, and the dynamic serves the movie well. But, they spend too little time on this relationship; instead focusing on other characters or strains that ended having little interest to the story itself.<br/><br/>Perhaps the main reason to see this movie is because of the scares, of which there are plenty. The entity, and even the younger sister, moves in a terrifyingly fast and disjointed fashion. The action to these scenes are rightfully kinetic and the sense of fear is real. There are also some disconcerting scenes, that are not scary, but off-putting. The camera work all around is well done during these horror moments, there was real sense of space to the house and the every character was framed well. All of this said, the horror did die down toward the end. The decision to show the entirety of the monster was a mistake, as my horror at contorted figure changed to mild amusement. Further, the story itself made some of the decisions made by Mama appear odd or just downright stupid.<br/><br/>The acting by Chastain is horrendous, as her character is played as stiffly as possible and her connection to the children is more or less ham-fisted. Further, besides the sisters, every character is uninteresting. Annabel is shown earlier in the film rejoicing at the fact that her pregnancy test was negative and more or less lived a care free lifestyle in rock band. This should have set up some tension when her boyfriend decided to adopt these kids. But it doesn't. In a hilariously bad scene, Annabel sits with her band mates and explains that she has to quit the band (it is never stated why, since she really does not do much). One of the band member retorts that she could just leave her boyfriend. But no, she loves him too much to do that. And that is that, no tension, no drama, I guess she will do anything or drop anything for the one she loves. There is no reason why Annabel is the way she is, and has no depth of character whatsoever, making her eventually warming up to the children hollow. <br/><br/>""Mama"" is probably one of the better contemporary horror films out there, and is worth a watch if you like the genre. Unfortunately, it is brought down by too many pitfalls that other horror movies find themselves in. There are good elements here, scary moments, good camera work, and some convincing acting by the sisters. It just feels unfinished or rushed."
"Bighorn-942-991901","2","0","2","22 October 2013"," Mama
","Mama is not smart, new or different but long ,slow and boring experience. Not a real horror, or ghost film by any standard. The concept of lost children raised by a revengeful female ghost is a good platform for a film. BUt, there is only poor character development, dull plotting throughout, and few if ANY scares. Chastain done a fine job but has little to do, little to react to and only at the VERY end does she turn detective and inquire into the history of the girls. Then everything bit of the doctor's research falls right into her lap. Boring. The ""doctor's"" storyline is under developed. He doesn't really study the two feral girls in any scientific way. No camera, testing of any kind! The bitter sweet ending elevates but it's a long wait. And the story begs for a coda to explain what happens to the new family next. Does not compare Exorcist or any modern horror classic. Do not recommend."
"zetes","8","0","1","21 October 2013"," Some minor flaws, but this is often terrifying
","Quite good mainstream horror flick. There are plenty of flaws, and it has the tendency to go too big at times. At its best, though, it's absolutely terrifying, easily the scariest movie I've seen so far this month. Its greatest assets are the two little girls who star in it, Megan Charpentier and (particularly) Isabelle Nelisse. They're both awesome, and, man, Nelisse really nails the creepy little kid thing about as well as anyone ever has. Jessica Chastain and Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau star (though Coaster-Waldau, so awesome in Game of Thrones, might as well not have, since he's sidelined for 90% of the picture for no good reason; why even waste the money?) as a couple who adopt Coaster-Waldau's two nieces, who have been lost in the forest for five years. They were supposedly alone, though they claim they were taken care of by someone (or something) they call Mama (spoiler: ). The film wisely keeps Mama offscreen for most of the movie, only giving you hints. When it does reveal her in more detail, well, it's damned scary. It's CGI, which I usually hate, but it's still freaky."

","Given the Title, the Movie is about, you guessed it, Motherhood. Or Variations thereof. But in case you missed it the first Scene is Dead Giveaway.

There are some Genuinely Creepy Stuff going on here and a few Legitimate Scares. But it does have a Downward Spiral of Effectiveness from the very Intriguing Beginning to the Unsettling Middle to the Awful and Disappointing Ending.<br/><br/>What works the best here is the Feral Children and the Domestic Experimentation. What works a little Less is the Mental Health Vapidity and Mama's Paranormal Backstory. There just isn't Enough Weight to make that make Sense.

"Horst_In_Translation","6","0","1","14 October 2013"," Be nice to your Mama
","Back in 2008, Argentine director Andrés Muschietti directed his 3-minute short film ""Mamá"". Five years later, it has reached such a great deal of popularity that it got adapted into a full feature. None of the original actors returned, but instead one of Hollywood's biggest rising stars, Jessica Chastain plays the female lead. Alongside her starring are Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau (Game of Thrones), Daniel Kash, Jane Moffat, two young child actresses, one of which already has an impressive body of work for her age, especially in the horror genre, and Javier Botet as Mama.<br/><br/>Being a huge fan of ""The Blair Witch Project"", horror thrillers are usually my favorite subgenre when it comes to scary films. Include lots of suspense, the supernatural and an atmospheric location for the setting and chances are good that I'll enjoy the watch. I don't really need to see the danger physically to be scared the most. On the contrary really, occasionally it takes away from the fright factor for me. ""Mama"" has all these components and that's why I enjoyed most of it. Even when we see the beast near the end and occasionally glimpses of it throughout the whole film, it didn't take away any of the experience for me. It was just such a bizarre sight, but somehow it worked.<br/><br/>Jessica Chastain was interesting to watch as a rock music bride with short black hair and she looked so different than in ""Tree of Life"", ""The Help"" or ""Zero Dark Thirty"". Her character transformation was one of the most interesting things about the film. Early on she starts being relieved she realizes she's not pregnant. A bit afterward she talks to a friend who says her to get away from her boyfriend and two daughters, but she says she can't and near the end she keeps risking her life and risks her life to protect the two young girls. When the end credits roll in, her character has developed into at least as much of a maternal figure as the demon. At this point, Annabel has become the Mama referenced in the films title.<br/><br/>All in all, it's a nice thrill-ride for 100 minutes. I'm a bit worried the physical figure of the demon may appear so bizarre to some that they may perceive it more as a comical figure than a truly dangerous force of nature. I didn't though, so I'm perfectly fine with how they portrayed her. The historic background of the character and the scenes with the girls' aunts are okay fillers (Seriously, did anybody not see it coming that she'd so get it from Mama?) although it's really all about Chastain's character and here and there they could have certainly cut a bit and made the film at least as good with a running time of 10-15 minutes less. However, there's also a couple scenes that were extremely well-made, like the one where one of the girls plays some string-pulling game with Mama in the room and we see Chastains character approaching at the same time after she hears the girl scream, but gets distracted in the last minute, which saved her from certain death. The final farewell scene was done pretty nicely as well. Good movie and I recommend it."
"xodanielcasterox","6","0","2","13 October 2013"," Creepy but no surprises
","Nothing special or new but still creepy in my book. Even though it has problems it still holds up for me. If you can accept the flaws it's pretty damn decent. Mama has some good jump scares, little bit of scary imagery & some pretty creepy moaning. but that's pretty much it. check it out & decide for yourself. It pretty much has story that was i guess OK. I will say it would be great if it didn't have this one big problem which I will not address. I just don't understand it has all. But I guess I'll let it go. It's just a movie anyways. You'll probably have to turn your brain off a little to enjoy it fully but maybe that's just me."
"amesmonde","Null","0","1","12 August 2013"," Stong supernatural thriller with a dirt tack final act.
","After an accident in which their father dies two young girls become feral, when they are rescued they are looked after by their uncle and his girlfriend, soon it becomes apparent that their survival was due to a spirit who won't let them go and the terror begins.<br/><br/>Thankfully the child actors are impressive, actor Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau is excellent in the dual role of the uncle and his twin although his screen time is sporadic. Lead roles include an almost unrecognisable Jessica Chastain as Annabel along with Daniel Kash as the doctor. There's also a strong supporting cast of worn faces, for a horror film the acting is far above average.<br/><br/>As supernatural thriller the first half is finely crafted by director Andrés Muschietti and packed with tension and chills. The sound design and music by Fernando Velázquez complement the scares and eeriness. However, the second half chooses to reveal the ghost too often and steals the fright factor of what Muschietti had created earlier, especially in the closing. <br/><br/>What starts as an intriguing mystery with genuine creepiness unravels becoming a special effects fest by the end (more finely tuned but reminiscent of The Nun (2005) effects). Mama is a solid ghost story with an interesting premise that revolves around the two girls and the back story of Mama. There's a cabin in the wood, a large house with a disgruntled spirit, creepy kids, the clichés are there but they are delivered efficiently. Nevertheless, Andrés & Barbara Muschietti's story leaves a few niggling questions unanswered, not around the antagonistic 'Mama' but some of the other characters.<br/><br/>Overall Mama is special effects laden which is a shame considering the added intricacies and strong retelling of a classic-esque ghost story. Still it's a strong well made addition to the genre."
"caradia","8","0","1","8 August 2013"," The ending was not well received
","The movie itself was an enjoyable fest of suspense and jump-out-of-your skin frights. I knew what was pretty much coming by the middle, although I was surprised that the doctor knew more than he let on.<br/><br/>I was with the movie up until the end. My only two complaints were that there needed to be more of a witness to what caused Anabel to suddenly care deeply for the girls and they her in return, well the oldest anyway and I was deeply upset that the ghost of Mad Edith was willing to let the oldest girl go because she wanted it but was not willing to let her sister go when seeing that choosing to kill the tot with her was clearly traumatizing the oldest sister. Why would she care enough not to upset her by not hurting Anabel and letting the oldest stay with Anabel, but yet take the most innocent one in the group and kill her off without one thought for the oldest sister? It was insanely selfish, but this is a mad woman so maybe that explains it. They try to justify the choice by showing the tot glowing and happy before their death, but I'm not having it one bit. Shame on them for taking such a magnificent movie and throwing that crap in at the end. <br/><br/>Still, it is a movie well worth watching."

","Mama, a supernatural horror movie, is ""workmanlike"" in the best sense of the word. It's not particularly innovative or deep, but if you're just looking for a well-made ghost story, Mama fits the bill nicely.<br/><br/>Mama isn't very gory, and unlike most contemporary ghost stories, it doesn't spring any particularly wild twists on its viewers. In fact, the story is rather straight forward, and the audience more or less always knows what's happening and why. Mama's charms are more simple, almost quaint: haunting atmospheres and spooky visuals, likable and smart characters, and strong acting across the board.<br/><br/>I would compare Mama to Ring, The Others, and The Sixth Sense."

","I am not ashamed to admit I really enjoyed this film. It's not a horror movie per se but is certainly full of suspense and not the end I predicted.<br/><br/>Our story starts with the girls ending up in the woods with Mama making her first brief appearance.<br/><br/>We then fast forward to uncle looking for them and eventually uncovering them in the very same cabin we leave them in at the opening scenes. Clearly feral these girls are going to need lots of therapy and care to return to some sense of normality.<br/><br/>Uncle wins custody and moves into a new house but Mama is not far behind and taking an active part in the children's life. This is where all the jumps and shocks will start to happen, no unnecessary violence or gore but the thought of what has happened / is happening , you think as the story unravels the end is going to be predictable but thankfully it isn't.<br/><br/>Sit down with a pillow if you of a nervous disposition and be prepared for a quite decent film"
"leonblackwood","5","0","2","27 July 2013"," Nothing Amazing, But Watchable 5/10
","Review: I'm not a big lover of paranormal/horror movies, but I quite enjoyed this one. What a big difference it makes when you have a bit of money and a great director to make a horror movie! Anyway, the storyline was written well and all of the actors put in believable performances, especially the little girls. The CGI that was used throughout the movie, really brought the film to light, but the beginning was left for the audience to piece together because it was a bit unexplained. The other weird thing about the film is that people just go missing and no one ever goes to look for them. Apart from that, it's a great movie for its genre. Watchable!<br/><br/>Round-Up: If your a fan of some of Guillermo del Toro's work, which includes the Hellboy franchise, Blade 2 and Pan's Labyrinth, then you well be used to the whole look and feel of this movie. The epic ending was great and some of the scenes were a bit scary, but nothing major. I also liked the moral of the story of a mothers love for her daughters, which is what the movie is basically about. It did seem to be in and out of the limelight pretty quickly because there are quite a few movies out in this genre so it might be quickly forgotten.<br/><br/>Budget: $15million Worldwide Gross: $146.5million (What a profit!)<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into there horror/thriller movies about a broken family. 5/10"

","Mama focuses on two small girls who are left in a cabin after their troubled father is killed by a malevolent spirit. Fast forward five years where the father's brother Lucas still has search parties trying to locate the missing girls. When one of the parties stumbles across the cabin where the girls have been holed up, they discover the children who are now in a feral state. The pair are brought to be examined by a psychiatrist, and eventually a judge rules they can be ordered to the care of Lucas and his girlfriend Annabel (Jessica Chastain). Once the children are moved in, it becomes noticeable that they have brought something sinister with them from that cabin in the woods.<br/><br/>Sometimes when you read the premise of a horror movie on paper, they sound pretty ridiculous. So as I write these next few sentences on the plot of Mama, I can understand how over the top the movie sounds. Without giving too much away, the spirit is actually what has taken care of the girls for the last five years while they were missing. She is now a maternal figure of sorts and jealous of anyone else who has come into their lives. Reading that, I know it all sounds outrageous, and it is. But it actually works in the context of the movie. What doesn't work is the ho hum pace set by half hearted scares that we have seen before in movies just as bland as this one. These are what would make Mama an around average horror flick. What makes it a bad watch is the moronic ending to close all the averageness. Viewers under 15 may not roll their eyes during Mama's final 20 minutes, but anyone over that age bracket is in for sure disappointment."

","While I didn't find ""Mama"" to be a particularly scary movie, it was a rather nice story and quite well told.

However, the girls brought an entity with them back from the woods, and Mama is a vengeful, jealous spirit.<br/><br/>As much as the movie missed a profound element to make it a movie that will raise the hair on the back of your neck and scare you out of the seat, ""Mama"" does work out quite well. It builds up a good sense of thrill and dread, by the work of the bizarre story and the way it is shot.<br/><br/>The effects in the movie were quite good, and worked right to the point. The CGI effects to portray Mama was rather interesting, making her seem human, yet dark, twisted and inhuman at the same time. Without these CGI effects, the movie would have been rather dull.<br/><br/>I had initially expected the movie to be more scary, as I had heard a lot about it. That being said, I am not disappointed or anything, the movie just turned out to be something else than I had thought it to be.<br/><br/>The ending was one of the better parts, as it is not your typical sunshine Hollywood ending.

But when I was finished watching it, I felt pleased that it wasn't. It told a good story and had a few good scares. The acting in the film was good for who the characters were, and what they thought and wanted. The scares were good, but after the first three I picked up a formula. Listen to the music. As the music started becoming silent, prepare for a jump scare. But while watch the film, although you knew when the scares where coming were still pretty scary.

","This was a very decent horror movie, with a few good jump out of your seat scares. The two little girls are of course what the plot centers around, and they act their parts very well for their young ages. The youngest girl in particular deserves extra credit for her efforts. The scenes of them crawling around like monkeys are very well done, especially the scene when they are discovered for the first time after being missing for so long. The CG effects and Mama character are first class and very convincing. Mama herself is scary enough, at first. Unfortunately she appears too often throughout the movie and this waters down the suspense and her scare factor, a clear case of the bad guy being over utilized. This type of movie is in ""The Ring"" category, but doesn't have the sense of dread that we often feel with these kind of movies. The ending was a bit sad and that was the only real thing that kept me leaving the cinema fully satisfied."

The overall experience of the movie and the soundtrack of this movie is great, and it offered some pretty good scares, so over all I would recommend.

I was a little disappointed by the lack of screen presence from Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau. I was also expecting a back story of the Father somehow helping to save the kids, but this was not developed. There is obviously the glaring hole in the plot which surrounds the cabin in the woods, and how the kids managed to survive for 5 years without being discovered by anyone, and how they survived hypothermia.

As bizarre circumstances unfold, Annabel starts to get the feeling something sinister has accompanied the girls and is ""protecting"" them.<br/><br/>For the most part, director / writer Andrés Muschietti adheres to the saying ""less is more."" We get quick and creepy glimpses of the supernatural entity. As the movie moves along, we are given longer and greater detailed glances at her. What looked very CGI the first time I took it in proved to be more convincing and practical at second look.<br/><br/>I found ""Mama"" full of great moments of genuine thrills and chills upon giving it a second chance. You'd think a horror movie you've seen before wouldn't hold as much tension when watching it again, but that's not the case with ""Mama."" It had more of an effect on me the second time around.<br/><br/>Every actor in the movie is convincing in their role. Jessica Chastain transforms from a 1960s blond southern belle into a black-haired punk rocker incredibly well. The girls are absolutely phenomenal and their authentic reactions to the events occurring to them are noteworthy.<br/><br/>""Mama"" isn't going to satisfy gore hounds with its ""less is more"" approach and lack of gore. However, Gothic horror enthusiasts and those who love a good ghost story with substance will thoroughly enjoy this. It's a creepy suspense-filled tale that you'll find yourself wanting to watch multiple times."

","Another dark fairy-tale horror from the Guillermo Del Toro stable, Mama is an initially touching tale of despair and abandonment that unfortunately develops into a frustratingly mediocre ghost story severely hampered by the usual culprits—bad CGI effects, digital colour tinting, and worst of all, incredibly cheap scares.<br/><br/>As a director, Andrés Muschietti clearly has a keen understanding of his medium, delivering some striking imagery, effectively conjuring up a creepy atmosphere, and commanding superb performances from child stars Megan Charpentier and Isabelle Nélisse, but his writing isn't as strong, his derivative script failing to bring much in the way of originality to the tired genre. Once the true nature of Mama's supernatural element becomes apparent, the film becomes a mess of clichés and predictability."
"Robert_duder","8","0","2","4 May 2013"," A creepy and dark fairy tale of sorts that succeeds in its goal
","I really looked forward to seeing Mama. The trailers intrigued me and I'm always looking for a really good horror flick. The tone for Mama is set almost immediately. Its dark and creepy and sad and full of intensity. It has all the ingredients of a great horror flick including some cheap thrills that made me gulp and jump (something horror movies rarely do to me anymore.) I would have loved to have seen this in the theatre because watching it at home loses some of those thrills. Still, the movie is perfectly creepy and makes your skin crawl. The mystery of the story and the meaning behind it all keeps you on the edge of your seat. I thought the film did drag more than a little towards the end and they struggled to really find new material to keep it at the customary feature length. Mama felt like a one trick pony at times and I expected more from it at times. My only other complaint is the actual monster that is Mama looks very fake at times. I'm not a big fan of overusing blatant CGI and instead of keeping Mama more mysterious and in the shadows they opt to use really obvious CGI special effects. Now don't get me wrong, because this was a decent horror flick with a good story and some good performances but it didn't blow me away.<br/><br/>Let it be known that I can't stand Jessica Chastain! Unfortunate for me since she's in every movie that gets released anymore. I don't understand why critics and fans alike think she's so great? She was deplorable in Zero Dark Thirty (an over-rated film anyways) and whoever cast her in this needs their head examined. Granted, she doesn't completely butcher the role (shockingly) but why would they cast her as a wild young ""punk"" chick with edge? She isn't believable at it and I think a younger actress could have done this much better. Still she finds her footing towards the end and actually turns in a decent performance. Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau is good as the determined Uncle. My only complaint here is that I think he is underused and I would have rather the story focused on him than Chastain but I am biased I suppose. His chemistry with Chastain is okay but nothing miraculous. The performances that are noteworthy in this film belong to two young girls. Megan Charpentier and Isabelle Nélisse are absolutely fantastic! They are dark and creepy and full of emotion. Nélisse especially gives a performance that should go into the horror annals right up there with Linda Blair in The Exorcist. They are such a vital part of the story and they hold their own in a big way. Daniel Kash is decent in his role as Dr. Dreyfuss but sort of underused as well like Coaster-Waldau.<br/><br/>Mama is a sight to behold in many ways. There are some incredibly creepy and well done scenes that you won't soon forget. The controversial ending (and I say controversial because many did not like it) seems at first to be overdone in many ways. It suddenly feels like a sci-fi epic instead of a horror flick and the music, and the cataclysmic climax on a cliff side at night, all feels almost too much for a horror flick but then at the same time I couldn't take my eyes off of it. Somehow in the context of this story, it worked. Director Andres Muschietti knows his story and how he wants to tell it and does it in a terrific way. Mama will keep you constantly guessing and constantly freaked out and that's the best you can ask for from a creepy movie. I am normally the first one that would encourage sequels especially to horror films but I'm not sure they could ever do another one of this and do it justice. 8/10"
"nesfilmreviews","6","0","1","4 May 2013"," Well made and delivers a few chills, but not fully satisfying.
","""Mama"" succeeds in generating a few genuine scares, but it predominantly provides some lingering, and creepy images--despite indulging into numerous clichés. It is a well-made film that delivers mild chills and thrills, with a solid cast to help gloss over the expected bag of tricks. It also helps tremendously to have Guillermo del Toro as an Executive Producer. <br/><br/>In the prologue to ""Mama,"" we learn of a shooting at a financial firm after an economic crash. A distraught executive named Lucas (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) arrives home, quickly collects his two young daughters, Victoria and Lilly, and speeds off. They end up in an abandoned house deep in the forest, where Lucas apparently intends to shoot his daughters before he can kill himself. But that is not quite how it works out. Five years later, Lucas' brother Jeffrey (also played by Coaster-Waldau) has never given up hope. Jeff's team of searchers comes across the abandoned house we saw a century ago in a nightmare. Dad's long gone, but the girls are still there - crawling around on all fours and making noises like wild animals. How could they have survived on their own? They are taken into the care of their dead father's brother and his rocker girlfriend away from the cabin they've called home all this time. Mama is none too pleased about this development, as I'm sure you can imagine. The girls are kept in isolation for a few months as Dr. Dreyfuss (Daniel Kash) records their every move while helping with their assimilation, given that Victoria keeps making cryptic references to an unseen Mama. Lilly sleeps under the bed, still occasionally eats bugs, and screams whenever anyone tries to touch her. The girls hardly seem ready for ice cream and bedtime stories, but Jeffrey is determined to give them a normal life. Muschietti and his story collaborators Neil Cross and Barbara Muschietti, managed to keep an entire back-story up their sleeves to reveal it in teasing fashion, which works to a degree, maintaining viewers engagement with the film. In addition, there are some creative nightmare sequences--a highly stylized dream set in which we see a crazed young woman screaming bloody terror before leaping off a cliff with her newborn. <br/><br/>Overall, the casting for the film is fine, especially the role of Annabel, played by Jessica Chastain, who slowly sheds her tough-talking exterior from ""Zero Dark Thirty"" (2012). Her nurturing instincts take over in this film, displaying her incredible range as one of the finest at her craft at this time. There are ideas and themes present in ""Mama"", but they are not quite fully developed to satisfaction, as the film does confuse at times when it seems to suggest that the idea of settling into a normal family unit could in fact be the real horror. Come the end, Muschietti may not have worked out all his own unresolved issues, but he does manage communicate his fears effectively. And besides, that's what sequels are for."
"Catharina_Sweden","6","0","2","30 April 2013"," A good solid ghost-story, but the ghost in itself is too noisy and blunt
","The best thing about this horror movie, was the fact that it contains a real, good story with a beginning and an end. There is a mystery to be solved, and it IS solved and everything is put to right (in a way...) in the end. In that way, this movie is a traditional Gothic ghost-story - which is what I like. This is not so usual in horror movies any more.<br/><br/>What I did NOT like, however, was the ghost. In a great ghost-movie, it takes a long time before you even see the ghost for the first time. The suspense builds up, and what you are afraid of is to BE afraid. It is very subtle. The ghost itself does not do so much - only its sudden presence is scary. Also, in our Western understanding of ghosts, they cannot really hurt anyone (except from scaring them to death), and they cannot move any objects in our world, etc.. If you try to touch them, your hand goes right through them. They can only be seen and their presence felt, and sometimes speak.<br/><br/>The ghost in this movie was more of the Asian variety, that crawls on the floor and even on the walls in a low position, wrestles down living people, throws them down stairs, changes shape etc.. It is a very material and noisy kind of ghost, and that destroys the scary feeling for me.<br/><br/>The actors were all very good, and especially the child actors. It is unusual to be able to get children to act that naturally and believably."

","Mama is a story about two little girls left alone in the woods after their father drives the car off a cliff. To survive, they create a fantasy ""mama"" figure who looks after them. After five years, their uncle finally finds them and, along with his rocker girlfriend, wants to adopt them. However the two girls are deeply disturbed and they must cut a deal with a psychologist who wants to study them.<br/><br/>This film has horror themes, with all the predictable mainstream horror clichés, especially with the never ending shock moments, the inexplicable scenes where the heroes must stay in the house and the fact that they do any investigations at night. Let alone they don't seem to talk to anyone else in the whole movie.<br/><br/>There are also many events, characters and information that happen that don't develop anything in the plot. And they aren't even red herrings.<br/><br/>The strongest parts of this movie are those that made The Ring a great movie - beautiful dark imagery, scary children and a mystery to unravel, but unfortunately in a completely more illogical way with much shallower characters.<br/><br/>Most of the situations were so ridiculous that I was laughing quite regularly. In fact, if it didn't have the ""it's so bad it's good factor"", I would have given it a much lower rating.<br/><br/>It's certainly one to watch if you want to be entertained and it's very well shot and a beautiful movie.

"chaos-rampant","Null","0","3","27 April 2013"," Energetic but easily freudened
","As a lifelong and avid watcher of horror, I've come to know what generally works for me.<br/><br/>One thing that puts me off is horror that spend more time tinkering with the wrap than the actual thing inside; a smart script, attempts at drama, good acting, polished visuals in a general sense, it is neither here nor there if a film has these for me however professional-looking the end result, and the same is true for nonhorror. That is all superficial attention to appearance. <br/><br/>What I do care about, by contrast, is ecstatic energy in the gears of narrative, raw edges; Texas Chainsaw, Suspiria, Halloween, Alien, The Funhouse, Evil Dead are all prime examples in horror. Drag Me to Hell more recently. They can be stylized or meticulously designed but that's not the point. The point for me is this visual energy that exhilarates, usually starts slow and builds to ritual dance.<br/><br/>My other parameter is that, generally speaking, horror is a matter mental urges, the story of ghosts is how we try to explain and reason with what just rose in the mind. So is this inner life of images clean apart from outside reality? Do we have for instance a portal to the horror dimension as normally in Stephen King? Or is it inextricable from mundane life, the same fabric? Do the images create the life? On this end we have all the ambitious stuff, from Videodrome to Inland Empire.<br/><br/>So what Del Toro puts on the table is just not for me. He is polished, professional, but the finished thing is usually meek and ever so reasonable, there is no letting go of mind. And the other-world of urges is always apart from life. So I have no use for his Devil's Backbone or Labyrinth. And whether because he attracts similar-minded talent or he has sway as a movie man, his produced films feel to me as tepid as his own—The Orphanage above all, well-made in a general sense but where's the passion?<br/><br/>This is well-made and at least the premise is effective, missing children are mysteriously rediscovered years later in a log cabin in the woods, having regressed in an animal state.<br/><br/>But again the main story, swathes of backstory about a mental asylum in the 1800's and psychological nuance are contrived, too much is cleanly explicable. We have some polished visuals, especially near the end. But the implications, the what-it-all-means, is sophomoric at best—as with Insidious last year and Del Toro's own stuff, the psychological world is its own fantastical realm, taken at face value. The aural effect may appeal to the teenage audience but it's a reduction from my view, or to quote from Joyce: ""when they were jung, and easily freudened"".<br/><br/>It may be the tipping point in this type of film was Poltergeist, where ever so dull Spielberg used all sorts of sfx gizmos to clarify Hooper's metaphysical force in the walls of the film.<br/><br/>Still, deep down there is some marvellous energy here, some startling occasions. For a while, this is as creepy as some of the Japanese stuff, where the point is a negative void. And then we have the swelling of jump scares, the forward motion—it is a dynamic effect. But all the other stuff works against this burying itself deep, we see and reason too much so the thing is made whole outside of us. Was a talent stifled here? We'll see in the future."

","Mama was the revelation of the film festival in Brussels. Everybody was screaming towards the screen and it even went so far that newspapers in Belgium were talking about THE horror flick to watch. So I did and I must say that I had mixed feelings about the flick. <br/><br/>I don't have any problem with Guillermo del Toro. I liked his flick Pan's labyrinth (2006) and I even could dig his remake of Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark (2010). But there lays the problem for horror buffs. There's always something fairy tale attached to his creatures. Just look at Don't Be Afraid...The monsters did look scary but they were full CGI and they could come straight out of a Disney flick or Lord Off The Rings or The Hobbit. I think you know what I mean.<br/><br/>Here the creature does look scary, even as it is done CGI, and the flick do has a lot of jump scene's that really worked. I even liked the story because the acting by the two children in the beginning in the cabin (after 5 years) was amazing. You just can't see what is coming and I sometimes even had the feeling that I was watching one of those Japanese ghost horror stories, you know, with the hair coming out of the wall or ceiling. We do have a bit of that too. <br/><br/>I know that Del Toro was executive producer but that means that he delivers the money so his influence in the way it was made is clearly to spot. <br/><br/>I was thinking, yes I can understand the hype but once everything comes clear about the mama ghost and the child it slowly turns in a bit of pathetic flick. For me the ending was a let down. I won't go into that part because a lot is already said about the ending. <br/><br/>If you like horror flicks with a lot of jump scene's than this is surely your thing and somehow I enjoyed it too. It even became creepy at moments but the ending. You will love it or hate it.

"knowyourmovie","6","0","2","17 March 2013"," An unimpressive, unsuccessful attempt to expand a three minute long video clip into a hundred minute long horror movie
","The recipe for a good horror movie is as easy to formulate as it is difficult to implement. Roughly speaking, a good horror movie needs to be a) at least somewhat original with a hint of depth; b) at least somewhat coherent without a too-strong artificial flavor; c) at least somewhat scary, but not in a cheap way.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, ""Mama"" produced by none other than Guillermo del Toro miserably failed in all the three categories. Nevertheless, being a failure from a pure cinematic perspective did not prevent the first-time director Andrés Muschietti s movie from becoming a box office darling: with the production budget of only $15.000.000, ""Mama"" collected an impressively hefty $118,434,000 worldwide.<br/><br/>A few years ago, Andrés Muschietti had already made a very short three minute long video clip also called ""Mama"" that was released in Spain in 2009.<br/><br/>It looks like the amateurish short video had generated enough interest in big professional cinema to secure for Andrés Muschietti a golden opportunity of making it into a full-length movie.<br/><br/>The original clip is available on YouTube and while somewhat cute (in a horror movie sense) it strikes me as not containing much substance to build upon. <br/><br/>Judging by the quality of the final product, generating buzz about a three minute long video turned out to be much easier task than actually expanding it into a hundred minute long movie.<br/><br/>The story (Andrés and Babara Muschietti) ends up being so hopelessly unoriginal that it is not even trying to pretend the opposite. It is extremely formulaic and almost exclusively consists of genre clichés. Those waiting for any unpredictable twist or turn of the story end up bitterly disappointed at the end.<br/><br/>Even with all its predictability, ""Mama"" still somehow manages to remain generally incoherent and (especially, closer to the end) full of obviously contrived coincidences. For example, why was a certain character so stubbornly and shortsightedly trying to visit a scary, menacing location in the middle of a dark gloomy night when he could have easily waited until morning? There is no good explanation for that except the ill wish of the story writers.<br/><br/>As if all of the above was not already upsetting enough, ""Mama"" generously throws another curve ball to its unsuspecting viewers - the quintessentially cheap kindergarten level scares. These ""when somebody jumps out of the corner or from behind your back and nastily screams ""Boo"""" kind of scares are not what we expect to see in a decent horror movie.<br/><br/>I have to say that my expectations of ""Mama"" in that area were already reasonably low. I, for example, was not expecting from it anything even remotely comparable to the famous ""Mystery Man"" scene – a little masterpiece from David Lynch's ""Lost Highway"" where a potent combination of the subtle makeup, the background sound, and the mind-bending dialog creates a thrilling creepiness of enormous power.<br/><br/>And still, even with the expectations as low as they were, ""Mama"" somehow managed to disappoint.<br/><br/>It became one more flop in the mixed record of Guillermo del Toro who is generally considered an authority in producing and directing horror movies. What had started with the great ""The Devil's Backbone"", the powerful ""Pan's Labyrinth"", and the ultimate masterpiece - ""The Orphanage"" has regrettably morphed into the simply laughable ""Don't Be Afraid of the Dark"" and the utterly mediocre ""Mama"".<br/><br/>The acting in ""Mama"" was only so-so, with the three notable exceptions. <br/><br/>The memorable characters created by the wonderful child actors Megan Charpentier and Isabelle Nélisse were one of the very few redeeming qualities of the movie. The casting in that respect in my opinion seemed to be superior to that of ""Hugo"" where the wooden screen duo of Asa Butterfield, and Chloë Grace Moretz looked bland, lacked chemistry, and in general left an artificial aftertaste.<br/><br/>Nominated for two Oscars in two consecutive years (""Zero Dark Thirty"" (2013), ""The Help"" (2012)) Jessica Chastain is undoubtedly one of the best actors of her generation and possibly (only time will tell) of all time. In addition, it looks like she might be one of the very few actors who always shine no matter what, even if they play in a weak movie like ""Mama"".<br/><br/>While ""Mama"" 's thin plot does not leave much room for character development, Jessica Chastain somehow manages to go beyond what the clichéd story dictates and adds quite a bit of depth and strong, believable emotion to the otherwise undistinguished character.<br/><br/>The visual effects in ""Mama"" are mostly solid, more or less imaginative, and even subtle when necessary, but overall they are not breathtaking enough to have any serious independent value. And without an independent value they simply become an unfortunate hostage of the poorly written and implemented movie they are featured in.<br/><br/>In addition, due to certain questionable decisions made in that area, some of the effects in ""Mama"" look almost too smooth, cartoonish, and fairytale-like to be truly scary. As a result, in some sense they even seem to be inferior to the very basic, but genuine effects from the low budget original video from YouTube. <br/><br/>Overall, ""Mama"" could have become so much better than what it ended up being! An emotionally involving tragedy, a haunting mystery, a strong trio of lead actors, solid special effects – all those valuable ingredients were essentially wasted on the silly, incoherent, and overall unsatisfying story.<br/><br/>In my opinion, the only reason to watch ""Mama"" would be enjoying one more great performance of Jessica Chastain. Otherwise, the movie could be safely avoided. <br/><br/>knowyourmovie.blogspot.com"

","'MAMA': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>Guillermo del Toro executive produced this supernatural horror film about two young girls left in the forest to live on their own, with a spirit (they call 'Mama') watching over them. When they're found and go to live with their uncle, and his girlfriend, 'Mama' goes with them (causing lots of havoc of course). It stars multi Oscar nominee and 'it girl' Jessica Chastain as the 'girlfriend' watching over the girls. The film was directed and co-written by Andres Muschietti. Andres wrote the film with Neil Cross and Barbara Muschietti and it's also an adaptation of a 2008 short film he wrote and directed. As far as these clichéd ghost horror films go this is a pretty entertaining one, that delivers the spooks you expect it too.<br/><br/>The film opens with a man named Jeffrey (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) suffering a mental breakdown, as the outbreak of the 2008 financial crisis is upon him, and he kills his business partners and wife. He takes his two young daughters for a drive, speeding down a snow covered road, and crashes in the forest. Planning to kill himself and his daughters he takes his two young girls to a cabin, in the woods, but is killed by a ghost before he can kill the children. The two girls, Victoria (Megan Charpentier) and Lilly (Isabelle Nelisse), are then raised by the mysterious spirit, which they call 'Mama'. When they're found, by a search party sent by Jeffrey's brother Lucas (also played by Coaster-Waldau), they're very animalistic (Lilly walks on all fours). After being examined by a psychiatrist (Daniel Kash) the girls are sent to live with Lucas and his punk rock girlfriend Annabel (Chastain). This becomes much more work than the couple is expecting, especially when 'Mama' begins making her presence noticed.<br/><br/>The movie is spooky, creepy and full of great visual effects. While the film is light on actual gore, unlike a lot of other modern ghost films, you do get to see a lot of the ghost action and 'Mama' makes a pretty classic movie monster/spirit. Chastain is of course above this kind of work but her presence does make the movie that much more believable and effective. When del Toro is involved (even just as an executive producer) you know you're going to get a quality film and this one definitely delivers what fans of the genre should be expecting. I'd say It's a pretty pleasant surprise for ghost/thriller fans!<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-onDgBMVyo"

It isn't something that played on my mind and that bothers me! Good horror always gets me psychologically and wakes me up in the night feeling like something is in the room.<br/><br/>Mama didn't visit me.<br/><br/>It is an original story, but there are bits which are very predictable, some bits which are just pointless, and some bits that didn't make sense. There was a gap left in the story, too, which i'm going to post a question about because i don't want to include spoilers here. That let it down for me. I was confused by it.<br/><br/>To be honest i didn't like the men and their parts in the film much! It was all about the little girls and they are fantastic little actors. Just wasn't scary, so i can't give it more than what i have... regrettably. <br/><br/>Horror needs to follow me home."

","This chiller benefits from the name of Guillermo Del Toro amongst the production credits and will be the reason many will view it, including myself who took the bus to Cineworld.<br/><br/>The plot begins with a father and his six and three year old girls crashing the car they are in off an icy road and fleeing to a long abandoned cabin where he pulls a gun to seemingly kill them. Pop has had a pretty rough time of it in the recession and has already killed several people including the girls' mother; those bankers have a lot to answer for. At this point the titular Mama; a maternal ghost makes her appearance and saves the girls. <br/><br/>Five years later and the now feral girls are discovered in the cabin by a couple of huntsmen in the employ of the sisters' uncle and his rock chick girlfriend played by Jessica Chastain. The pair of whom, after a period of assessment are entrusted with the care of the siblings (along of course with the maternal ghost). The scares and chills are ratcheted up from here on as Mama becomes a we bit overprotective (think psychotic Jewish mother on amphetamines with a taste for nursery rhymes and neck snapping) and there follows some moments that genuinely sent chills down my spine. However the director overly relies on the sudden movement loud bang kind of scare which I see as lazy horror film making. As the movie goes on we see more and more, literally of the motherly spectre which to me is a lot less scary than the glimpses we glean of Mama in the earlier stages of the movie. <br/><br/>The movie creaks to a finish with some amateur investigating by the Dr that assessed the girls and their would be aunt into the origin of Mama. For me the denouement was overblown,overextended and ultimately unsatisfying. Which is a bit of a shame as the cast put in solid performances and are deserving of better. The bus fare and entry fee were justified, and overall I think fans of both the genre and Guillermo will be satisfied."
"Bonhamkt","6","0","1","7 March 2013"," Horror Trunk Review: The hand that rocks the cradle.
","Mama offers the expected horror clichés, but remains notable for it's clever choice of camera angles, adequate jump scenes, and thanks to the acting the narrative is (to an extent) believable.<br/><br/>The CGI works well in the beginning as we see snippets and quick flashes of the unknown presence, but then the ghost is revealed too early in the film. This however would be fine if the source of the fear was something to behold in terror and could remain so after the reveal, but if we don't 'believe' in it, it has lost it's direction and our attention. However, the overall setting and shots in the film, combined with good acting, allows for an enjoyable horror, just don't take it too seriously. Enjoy and embrace Mama for its cliché's and obvious build- ups. <br/><br/>Conventions are after all created because they work within their genre, and this film is no exception.<br/><br/>Full review at the horrortrunk website."

","First, i would have give it a 10/10 but ""mama"" is kinda comical looking (still scary) and the whole cinema was laughing at certain scenes with mama in them, but obviously she is still one scary lady!! This film was overall really good, it gets into it straight away and doesn't disappoint. The storyline was very good, and kept you on the edge of the cinema seat!! This is on my list to watch twice!!! One other thing is the way in which mama and the step mom are portrayed, Towards the end you get kinda sympathetic towards mama (which soon changes) Also, i am a big fan of little twists and dramatic plot changes and this film had both - make sure you watch the film and not hide behind your hands as to not miss any information given about ""mama"" <br/><br/>If your unsure whether to watch this film or not, my advice to you is to watch it! :D you wont be disappointed...

","The Good points: decent story kinda felt for the mama even if she was a bitter old thing,good scenery suited the mood of the film .Jessica Chastain was very good as a leading actress. Megan Charpentier & Isabelle Nélisse were superb.The sound affects really did a another layer to the intensity and made the creature more unnatural which helped as it was CGI and at times didn't feel like a threat.<br/><br/>The Bad Points:Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau acting could of been better some scenes he seemed to casual and chilled out e.g seeing black stuff coming out of the wall or being almost run over.The over use of music, it took away from the tension as it was cue that something was gonna happen .Some scenes felt too long and repetitive such as when they were in the house.The shock value also went during the final act, the more we saw of Mama and i found her not that scary during the end Just a bitter spirit.<br/><br/>Conclusion:It's a well made film,the mise en scene was good and really did add a eery tone.The sound effects were really good and helped to make the creature creepy especially when Jessica is in bed.The acting was generally good maybe a little stiff but hey it's horror."

","The problem is: I have seen far worse. I walked out of too many movies. I didn't walk out of this one. I had no complaints because my expectations were really low. Generic story with generic acting, bland CGI and a rather predictable ending. It's the Grudge meets the Eye meets the Others, meets god knows what else. <br/><br/>Why did it have to be a ghost, though? To start in the woods with two little toddlers left there alone in the cold, and end up with a ghost story is so lame. However, it's not a movie with the major Hollywood poop that usually gets on my nerves and insults my intelligence, nah... just another drab story. <br/><br/>It was a bit scary for me though. Because I am not a horror movie buff, and because I was always anticipating something to happen (which doesn't). <br/><br/>If you thought the grudge (the American version) was amazing, you'll like this movie. If you thought the Grudge was just about alright, so don't bother."
"Thomasamills","8","0","1","28 February 2013"," The First Great Horror Film of 2013
","When 'Pan's Labyrinth' creator Guillermo del Toro puts his name to what seems to be a routine horror flick, you know there must be something different about the film. Also having recently Oscar nominated Jessica Chastain in the lead role is another huge selling point. These two names are what new horror film 'Mama' are boasting in order to get audiences to come back to the cinema and believe in horror films again, after a mediocre 2012 for the genre. Whilst big names may be enough for the film to succeed at the box office, what horror fans really want is for the film to be actually scary. I'm sure they won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>'Mama' follows two young sisters who have spent most of their lives living in the woods and when found are convinced they were nurtured by something they called Mama. They are rescued and move in with their uncle played Nikolaj Cosat-Waldau and his girlfriend played by Jessica Chastain. However, once they have moved into their new home, it seems that Mama hasn't been left behind in the woods, has followed the girls and doesn't want to leave them anytime soon.<br/><br/>The first thing to say about 'Mama' is that it is very creepy. Whether or not the film will genuinely scare you depends on how you react to these type of films. If you suffer from paedophobia (a fear of children) in the context of horror films, then 'Mama' will have you covering your eyes in the cinema. The performance from the children are genuinely creepy yet also impressive at the same time. Jessica Chasteain is very strong and shows audience just how diverse her performances can be, from this to 'Zero Dark Thirty' and 'Lawless'.<br/><br/>The film may not be the scariest film released in cinemas over the past few years, but it is one of the most original. The script fleshes out each character and a real sense of spookiness stays with you long after you leave the cinema. I personally see the film more as a supernatural thriller then a horror. They is no fake blood and gore to be found here. Just genuine chills and thrills.<br/><br/>'Mama' may not be a ground braking entry to the genre, but its an original ghost story that i think does its job rather well. Definitely worth seeing on the big screen and guaranteed to make you jump, 'Mama' is a solid, creepy thriller.<br/><br/>Final Score 8/10"

"jacob_44-558-834207","7","0","1","22 February 2013"," GREAT, for a horror movie .. (Spoilers)
","So I bought the tickets and went in expecting to see just another typical scary movie where they'll have you jump out your seats a couple of times and leave the theater thinking ""the ending could've been way better"", it surprisingly did way better than just that. I gave the movie a rating of 7 in comparison with every other movie I've seen, for the ones in its genre, though, I'd give it around 8.5 mainly because other horror movies nowadays sadly just don't deliver. Having liked the movie so much, I just couldn't help but write this review, I'll mainly give my opinions in regards to the storyline first, followed by the acting and visual aspects of the film. <br/><br/>The main plot in my point of view was just way too typical.Typical meaning that Its basically about some kids who have their interactions with this female ghosts, then their mom or female guardian tries to get in on it all, whereas the male in the plot would either be left out of the story until the end,that being the case in Mama, or wouldn't believe it all while his wife/girlfriend goes nuts until the very end where he actually sees everything for himself and blah blah. What made this one really good, though, was that's its mainstream plot was set upon a very clever, well though off story, unlike paranormal activity for example where they set the movie just for that adrenaline rush it gives you. Having the ghost named ""Mama"" makes you think that she is the children's mother as she was killed in the beginning of the story as well. To support that theory she also saves what was thought to be her daughter from the father who tried to kill her at the cabin. Having seen all that you immediately go ""okay so this is the ghost of the mother who died at the beginning of the movie"". Then out of nowhere they just come up with this story that happened a long time ago of a woman failing to jump off a cliff, killing herself but not the baby in her arms. She is set to walk through the woods since then trying to finish what she started and go to that same cliff with a child in her arms. She turned out to be Mama after all. This twist that was brought in is, in my opinion, what made the movie better than others of its genre. Kinda like ""The Others"" starring Nicole Kidman back in 2001, the storyline makes it more than just a horror movie.<br/><br/>As for the movie in terms of acting and visuals, I felt as though the whole cast did a great job in playing their role, apart from Jessica Chastain who was incredible. I just thought she played her role flawlessly; the emotions she brought just from her facial expressions, let alone the other expressions, gave the movie a much more depth and integrity. It's always tricky when it comes to the ghost in horror movies, it's such a fragile matter to deal with, add in one more scene and it's too much the movie becomes less scary and more boring, take away a few scenes and you'll leave dissatisfaction as people mainly watch horrors for that ghost in that story. With Mama, many would say she had just too many appearances, which is true she really did. It reminded me a lot of ""The Woman in Black"" for some reason, and I think that the woman (ghost) in that movie was dealt with in a better way; she did appear a couple of times, but just enough for audience's satisfaction. Nevertheless I think the wonderful storyline in Mama complements those 'over-appearances' making the movie really good as it is. Especially in the end where it goes from just horrifying events to ones that actually have deeper feel to them. Apart from ""The Others"", this story had the best ending I've seen in a horror one throughout the last decade."

"busdog","5","0","2","22 February 2013"," The Trailer was much better than the movie
","This is not a good movie. How can an experienced, talented director show the villain/ghost/bad guy/girl so early in a movie? At that point, almost all suspense is lost. If we didn't know if the 2 girls were imagining things, or if maybe some other character was doubling as Mama. . . . if the plot had some uncertainty then the movie would have been far better. Instead, it is rather full of clichés, often makes no sense and is on the whole a big disappointment. The trailer was genuinely more frightening than the movie. You know a movie isn't good when you start looking for and counting the number of things that don't make sense (visiting dark cabins after 10pm rather than at 10am, etc), and I did that a lot. The only interesting thing is Jessica Chastain's face, which is oddly complex and bony."

","Having seen the trailer I went to this with high hopes & a bit of trepidation as I know my wife scares easily when watching creepy movies . In a lot of ways this delivered but ultimately it left me with a sense of never quite following through. The set up for the movie is good the cast are extremely solid Jessica Chastain is very believable & the two young girls played by Megan Charpentier & Isabelle Nelisse are both excellent in their roles. The set piece scares are well delivered & while some may say clichéd , there are only so many ways that you can deliver a scare in a ghost movie so lets not get to hung up on how that's done. Again there are the usual points in any film of this genre were you find yourself shouting why are you going in that cabin in the dark , or why don't you switch the lights on in the house , but lets face it , its not real so you suspend belief. Where the movie ultimately let me down was in the last 20 minutes , the director could have played safe & given the ghost the resolution it desired , or he could have done something off the wall in the end it fell in a slightly strange nether region that just left me feeling dissatisfied. Its a decent movie that's worth a look but its been done better & wont live long in the memory."
"Christian_Dimartino","8","0","1","16 February 2013"," She's one ugly motha.
","It's been a while since Guillermo Del Toro has directed anything, but that doesn't mean that he's vanished. Two years ago, he produced a suspenseful let-down called Don't Be Afraid of the Dark, and now he produced another movie called Mama, and it's a crap-ton better.<br/><br/>Mama mainly focuses on Annabelle(the lovely Jessica Chastain), the unfortunate girlfriend of a nice guy. They seem to have a nice relationship, but unfortunately she gets more than she, as one friend says in the movie, ""signed up for"", when he finds his nieces. His nieces have been missing for five years. <br/><br/>His brother ran off with them one afternoon and they haven't been seen since. Annabelle doesn't really want them to live with her, but she does it because of her boyfriend. She gets a bad vibe from these kids. What were they doing for five years? Were they alone? Not far into the movie, she is pretty much left to take care of them, and the truth slowly reveals.<br/><br/>Like 2011's Insidious, Mama proves that a scary movie can have good acting. It isn't a myth. Before seeing it, you will wonder why someone like Chastain would choose to do a movie like this. Then you see it, and its pretty obvious. Mama is an effective scary movie, one that actually does sends chills down your spine.<br/><br/>Chastain does a decent job of letting the audience connect with her. But Mama's true strength is it's quiet freaky moments. Instead of having the music make us jump or freak us out, this one has quietly creepy moments that really work. Is this The Exorcist material? Nope. This is a satisfying movie with some chilling moments, but the execution could've been handled better. Nonetheless, Mama is still worth seeing.You might be surprised.<br/><br/>B+"
"lisa_camm","8","0","1","14 February 2013"," Nice original feel. Mama is one scary lady!
","Hadn't even heard of this film before i found it! Much better than i expected from the trailer. Certain things we've seen before...moths, parallel universes, scary old hag with hair like fabric tar! But, this had a good mixture with some new ideas. Loved how the children walked on all fours. But, the fridge seen where they were found in the house?! Presumably part of the fantasy feel because they were obviously half the size and 1/5 of the width they should be! Anyway, thought the girls characters and acting was fantastic and i did have some frights during it. Think the first seen we saw of Mama where she spooked up behind the ladies (sorry, awful with characters names!) back was a goody. Just like the scene in Insidious where we first see the devil. Then, there were many more shocks like that. I did like the idea behind the girls being brought up like wild animals. Think we all may have heard of the girl that was raised by wolves?? Reminded me of that real life story. 8 out of 10 for me. Would watch again. Did lay in bed after and feel a bit scared because under my bed has recently been cleared out. She could have been under it, who knows! PS: I DON'T SCARE EASILY!!!"

","The moment I saw from the opening credits that the movie was from Guillermo del Toro, I knew that I was into something good. I was not disappointed. The film is creepy and horrifying in parts. The child artists are very impressive and the murderous wraith, the 'mama' is scary enough. The film, however, belongs to Jessica Chastain, who portrays Annabel, a rocker chick, who is forced to become a nanny to two rather unwholesome, unholy kids. However, Annabel's character development is awesome. Not for a moment does she falter, even when her fiancé is confined to intensive care and the kids (and their mama) play all sorts of nasty tricks on the poor girl. The plot may be a bit thin, a bit outlandish, and may have the usual horror film clichés, but all in all, the film impresses. And that is a true compliment, because horror films seem to have run out of ideas these days.. one can almost anticipate the next move, the next scene, the next scare. Not so with this one.

","Unlike some other reviewers this didn't completely blow me away. Certainly there were beautiful elements and disturbing imagery, but overall I felt there was too much scary movie and too little focus on the subtext.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, I felt this was a film unsure of its own feet. It wanted to be a dark and atmospheric exploration of the ghost genre; something like Session 9 perhaps. Instead there was too much reliance on established scare tactics, what I call popcorn-pleasers as they satisfy the status quo cinema-goer but are simultaneously shallow, indicative of lazy direction and script. The best scares are those insidious, ongoing and creepy horrors that gradually drag you into the movie universe and leave you there with nowhere to run. That takes effort and talent, but neither were evident in Mama.<br/><br/>There are many clichés too. The Japanese style is clearly an influence, but these days that's a tired reference point. Visual effects were stunning with some interesting techniques but again too reminiscent of films like The Ring.<br/><br/>Characterisation was similarly lazy, little to no effort made to flesh out the initial cardboard cut out personalities of the 'rock chick' girlfriend and the 'cool uncle', though most of the players did a sterling job with the material available, particularly the child actors. Not so Daniel Kash who, apparently believing he was in a Hammer horror, hammed it up considerably.<br/><br/>Overall, an entertaining film but ultimately disappointing when it fails to deliver on the promise of the first half hour and rambles off into familiar territory.

I found as a parent that this story was made much more spooky and chilling than any other movies that involved children as a center of the story.

This PG-13 rated movie isn't for everyone, but if you are a fan of horror, and like to be scared silly, you shouldn't miss it. Though not the most original film, it packs a heavy fear-factor for every ghost-loving movie goer.<br/><br/>Mama Reviewed by Raven Devanney, age 15, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic<br/><br/>Go here to see Raven's full video review! http://www.you-tube.com/watch? v=HMV5t7V1V3U<br/><br/>""Mama"" tells the story of two young sisters, Lily and Victoria, who are abandoned in the woods for five years. When the girls are found and taken into custody by their uncle and his girlfriend Annabelle, everyone begins to wonder how these toddlers could have survived for so long on their own. The girls' strange behavior leads Annabell to believe that the girls weren't alone in the woods after all, and in fact, a troubled ghost called Mama was caring for them. But when they leave the forest, they don't leave Mama.<br/><br/>I really enjoy this movie. It is definitely scary to watch, but when it is over it doesn't leave you feeling afraid. I'm convinced this movie is a mix between ""The Woman in Black"" and ""The Possession."" It has a very similar ghost with the same motives as The Woman in Black, and has the same creepy bugs from ""The Possession."" The ending is especially similar to ""The Woman in Black."" No spoiler alerts or anything, but you think all will be fine but it's not. I guess you shouldn't go to a horror film if you're looking for a happy ending.<br/><br/>I like the cinematography, and the use of lighting and sound track, to set the ominous mood for this film. The dull colors and grey wash of the scenery really helps the spook level of the movie. The one thing I have a real problem with was the animation of Mama's face in the last few scenes. This is supposed to be the height of the horror, the film's climax, but Mama's face is so unrealistic that it pulls me out of my horrified trance and I am no longer scared.<br/><br/>My favorite character is Annabell (Jessica Chastain), because she isn't too enthusiastic about suddenly having to take on a motherly role, especially since the girls have serious social problems. Her boyfriend, the main caretaker of the kids, gets seriously injured, leaving Annabell in charge. I love watching her relationship develop into love for Lily and Victoria, and when Mama comes to play, she does a wonderful job showing her fear.<br/><br/>My favorite scene is in the very beginning of the movie, when it shows how one-year-old Lily and three-year-old Victoria end up in the woods. It is a very twisted scene, but I like how they show the girls adapting to their new surroundings. They adapt through crayon drawings on the walls, which is very creative.<br/><br/>I give Mama 4 out of 5 stars because it is definitely thrilling, but since it is so similar to some other films in this genre, I have to take a point away for lack of originality. I recommend ""Mama"" for ages 13 and up because of its intense content. If you're into anything Horror, Thriller or ghost related, then you'll love Mama so go check it out!"
"rgblakey","6","0","1","3 February 2013"," Beware mothers fury in Mama
","The ghost haunting genre has been done to death at this point. More often than not they just don't offer anything new to the genre or even as films. They latest to tackle the subject comes in the form of Mama, produced by Guillermo del Toro and features Jessica Chastain, but is that enough to deliver something new or will it be just be another film that needs to be exorcised? <br/><br/>Mama follows a man along with his girlfriend forced to raise his young nieces after the death of his brother that left them alone in the forest for 5 years. Taking on the difficult task becomes more challenging when it becomes clear that they may not have come out of the forest alone. Surprisingly this film delivers pretty well overall despite its standard PG-13 rating. Chastain does a fine job as usual, but the overall vibe of her character almost doesn't really seem to have a point, but at the same time doesn't affect the finished product. For this film to really work falls in the hands of the young girls who have to be likable and creepy all at once and they succeed. This aspect of the story is what helps to step it out of the shadows of every other film in this genre to deliver something a bit more fresh. For the majority of the film it works really well, giving some great build up and development, but loses a bit of steam in the finale. It doesn't ruin the movie or anything it just gets predictable and shows too much of Mama. Throughout the buildup you see here numerous times, but they keep it in the shadows and quick glances and it works perfectly to create a truly creepy character, but once she is fully revealed is a bit silly looking. With that being said, it still works and some of the direction they do go with the finale was a bit unexpected which makes up a bit for the disappointing reveal.<br/><br/>This film is one of the better of the genre to come along in some time. While the trailers attempted to lead you to believe it might be scary, this film sports more of a creepy nature than anything scary, but still works fine. The little girls make this film especially the younger of the two who is just disturbing on numerous levels throughout the film. If you enjoy this genre, then Mama is defiantly one you will want to give a try."

","Ghost story centering around two young girls left to fend for themselves in the woods. They are then taken under legal supervision by their uncle and his partner (Jessica Chastain) under the proviso that a psychiatrist could have full access to them to piece together their fragile mental state. It appears that something may have followed them in from the woods.<br/><br/>Mama completes an intriguing horror quartet of Gullermo del Toro produced/directed movies: The Devil's backbone, Pan's Labyrinth and The Orphanage. From a horror perspective all these movies share a running theme of redemption that elevates the movie away from the hoy paloy of shock horror or spooky frights.<br/><br/>Kudos also to Chastain for playing another strong female lead, she is easily the best actress going at this moment, also special mention to the child actors in this movie who deliver genuine creepiness. <br/><br/>Mama succeeds in being both scary and tragic. The spooky she's behind you moments are genuinely fraught with concern for the characters, and the final cathartic last act delivers not only chilling fright but also a huge emotional wallop that may have you reaching for the tissues. A welcome edition to the genre and a movie that will stick with you when the lights go out."

","Mama is a pretty frightening movie, even for jaded scare freaks, about possession and asylums and demons and whatnot. It's not that it's not for the faint of heart - it's only PG-13, for goodness sake - it's that the scares are as psychological as they are visual. It's very well crafted, with an atypical ending and top-notch performances by a pair of young girls. It does dabble in some horror tropes and lapses in logic, but overall it's very successful at what it tries to be - a movie that burrows into your head to make you wonder what is coming next.<br/><br/>Victoria (Megan Charpentier) and Lilly (Isabelle Nelisse) are two very young girls whose father suddenly comes home one day and takes them away - ""Mommy's sick"" - to an isolated cabin in the middle of a snowstorm, and then he's gone. Don't ask me how or why; it'll spoil things. This leaves the girls - aged three and one (!) to fend for themselves. They are found five years later, and after the quickest custody battle of all time, they are handed over to their Uncle Luke (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) and his rock-band girlfriend Annabel (Jessica Chastain, seriously). To facilitate the handover, Dr. Dreyfuss, who has been studying the girls, sets them all up in a nice new house, the better to get unfettered access to them. After all, they've been feral for five years. Young Lilly almost never walks upright. Victoria retains some memories of life before losing her mom and dad, but even she harbors some very dark secrets - after all, who's been feeding the girls all this time?<br/><br/>Shortly into the movie, Luke is incapacitated and endures a hospital stay, while Annabel - who had been considering leaving him - is stuck with two very unorthodox sisters with a mysterious past. Maybe some nurturing is in order, but it doesn't seem to be rocker Annabel's thing. Even so, she loves Luke enough to give it a go until he can return home. That's when all hell breaks loose. You see, readers, it seems something has followed the girls from that lone cabin in the woods, something that had been protecting it, something that sees Luke and Annabel as intruders, not helpers. Something...well, something not good. Things happen in the house that prove to be very unsettling to Annabel; the girls seem to have a new, unseen playmate but remain mostly incommunicado. It's not quite Amityville Horror-level, with bleeding walls and such, but it's not a relaxing environment. Only Lilly seems at ease; Annabel knows something is up but has no idea what's in store for her, and Victoria is caught in the middle, having known a life before the abandonment.<br/><br/>One of the treasures of this movie is in piecing together what's happened to launch all events into motion. Why did the dad take the girls away? Where is the mom? You have to listen closely to news reports - which usually feel like nothing more than background noise - to learn the truth. <br/><br/>One side note about Chastain - she is virtually unrecognizable. Gone is the flowing red hair. She looks more like Courtney Cox in the Scream movies. She does fine with the material she has to work with, in fact a bit better.<br/><br/>It's a dark, dark movie, Mama is. Who is Mama? Is it the girls' mother, not really dead? Is it her ghost? Is it someone else? Is it no one else - an imaginary friend created by the girls to cope with living alone? It takes the adults in the movie about as long to figure it out as it will take the average viewer, and that's a good thing. Motives are not always obvious, and research - by Dreyfuss - is undertaken. This movie manages to pull off the trick of including a scary demon/ghost/whatever without showing her too fully (as in bright light or even fully formed). There are just enough unanswered questions - too many, and it's a flawed film, and too few and it's an overly neat film. And even though we can all guess where all roads lead in a geographic sense, the ending is a solid, plausible, emotional surprise."

","Making a decision about whether to watch a horror movie or not takes a lot of thoughts compared to other genres. Mostly because the level of getting the fear is different on individuals. Some may find the Final Destination series scarier than the Seed of Chucky due to the common car accidents that they can relate to in real life. Or it could be the other way around if someone is hypochondriac enough to imagine a doll moving itself.<br/><br/>The ""Mama"" contains a plethora of exhilarating and nerve-wrecking moments that easily make audiences petrified for 108 minutes. There are extraordinary conflicts revolve around every character as the story carries to the cliffhanger. <br/><br/>The acting isn't the best, but the chemistry among the cast works well, especially Megan and Isabelle who execute difficult roles of brainwashed nieces who are capable of bouncing off the wall as four-legged animals and going back to acting like innocent children whose favorite foods are moths and moldy cherries. <br/><br/>A round of applause goes to Jessica Chastain whose memorable performance that requires a dramatic transformation to play the role of Annabel that evolves from an insolent girl with no interest in looking after girls into a caring and loving woman. And Mama, I don't want to go too far with her role because it will turn into a spoiler, but let me just say ""Bravo.""<br/><br/>By looking at the critics and reviews so far, it does not seem highly positive as a few hardcore horror movie fans have given some crucial feedback about the realism, originality, and how the movie is kinda predictable. But despite those facts, I have never seen a movie that dissipates so much intensity and nervousness on the cusp and still manages to reach the climax. It is really worth watching it."
"hi_im_manic","6","0","1","31 January 2013"," Mama will have you calling for your Mama.
","I went to watch this film in a theater and had very high expectations, due to the director and producer. I was not disappointed. The storyline was intriguing, but I expected more. Perhaps the DC on Blu-ray will have more substance. I look forward to it. I found the antagonist (mama) pitiable. Obviously she was mentally challenged, but loved her child - and any child- long after her demise. As a ghost, she managed to spare an innocent child's life, and helped raise 2 girls who were left alone in the wilderness. She was a good mama, but as movie-goers will see, she's also a very jealous one. After the 2 girls are rescued, they go to live with their biological uncle and his free-spirited girlfriend. They are given a large house and must make the best of things as a family. Soon the couple learns that the girls did not come back alone."
"farrahmack93","9","0","2","26 January 2013"," MAMA review. slight spoilers possibly..
","MAMA in my opinion was a great movie, yea the villain was slightly over done. The plot and the acting totally made up for that, there was also a lot of suspenseful jumpy scenes. I think the two little girls were brilliant actors, they acted better than some full grown adults I've seen act.The older female lead was a great kick ass character, I loved the way her character bonded with the two young girls. The plot was interesting and kept my attention which is saying a lot. I'm glad I chose to see this film my fiancé and I haven't stopped discussing it since we saw it. I give this movie a nine out of ten, it was a very interesting startling film."

","Over a decade ago, when they re-released THE EXORCIST in theaters, adding a deleted scene where Linda Blair's possessed Regan walks upside down on all fours – referred to thereafter as the ""Spider Crawl"" – it was both chilling and nightmarish.<br/><br/>Here's to a new generation of Spider Babies, two of them reared in the woods by a mysterious wraith known as MAMA and then adopted by their city slicker uncle and aunt to be raised domestically Good luck! Uncle doesn't matter since he's given a break halfway through – as he recovers in the local hospital, Jessica Chastain's grungy rocker Annabel stays at a big house to watch over the two wild children; Victoria and her younger sister Lilly: both a cross between literary wolf-raised kids and the kind of possessed brats popular in horror films.<br/><br/>The stipulation from an investigative Doctor Dreyfuss (sort of a medical version of the Exorcist himself) is that the only way the couple could adopt the children would be to stay at this particular cursed dwelling.<br/><br/>Like all ""haunted house"" movies, you have to stretch disbelief to the limit as to why anyone would stick around such a formidably spooky pad, especially when Mama, a stretched-out demonic witch seemingly born from gangly vegetation, keeps appearing with enough vengeful shrieks and moans to wake a thousand dead souls.<br/><br/>The shock value works well on two important levels: The setting is ominous, giving the impression anything can happen at any time – and there's an abundance of successfully spooky jolts that occur out of nowhere, several having the title character rushing toward the screen in an ominous whoosh! The director (and producer) knows how to manipulate nightmare images, but towards the middle and end are too many computer effects. Plus, the suburban house location is much scarier than the woodsy cabin where the story begins and that several characters sporadically return to.<br/><br/>What's better off implied becomes much too visible: That being Mama, who can be pretty darn scary, sure, but those two little girls crawling around during the first twenty minutes provide just as many, if not more, chills to the old spine."
"khcastillo","9","0","3","20 January 2013"," Children in Horror movies are creepy (Review for my Films and Theatre Class)
","Children in horror movies are always creepy. From creepy orphans to children's laughter, it has been socially accepted that children makes any horror movie creepier than it would be without it. A new psychological horror masterpiece that takes advantage of eerie environments and spine-tingling sound-effects is the first feature length movie of Andres Muschietti. Based on the short film he created a few years back of the same title; Mama (2013), tells the story of two orphaned girls that miraculously survived five years in a cabin in the wilderness because of a sorrowing mother who feeds them cherries and protects them from danger. It truly shows that a mother's love goes beyond life itself.<br/><br/>Victoria (Megan Charpentier), and Lilly (Isabelle Nelisse) are left for dead after their estranged father went ballistic after his company went bankrupt killing his partners and his wife. Their uncle Lucas (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) and his girlfriend Annabel (Jessica Chastain) won the custody of these almost feral children, after five years of searching in the woods; as well as a supernatural being, the children call 'Mama,' that will haunt them until they figure out why Mama is so attached to the two girls and how they can bring Mama to peace.<br/><br/>Chastain's character is the rocker girlfriend that did not want to be a mother yet learns to love and understand the two girls. Charpentier's character is the older of the two sisters that becomes the bridge between Mama and Annabel. Charpentier's acting is impressive, however; Nelisse, the younger of the two, is even more impressive. Her character is the most feral of the two where she reverted to animalistic behaviour. Acting in an animalistic manor, including making animal noises and walking on all fours, is difficult especially to a young girl. <br/><br/>The direction of Muschietti is superb for a new director especially for a psychological horror that follows the generic plot of other famous movies such as The Orphanage (2007) and Orphan (2009) where orphans are usually associated with a super natural being or power that causes havoc to the people around them. Cinematography is as equally important as direction. Mama (2013) does some cool things when it comes to scaring the pants off of its audience. It uses its sound effects very well, and one sound might have been inspired by Ju-On: The Grudge (2002). The sound of a creaking door became associated with fear right after Ju-On: The Grudge (2002) was released. In Mama (2013), the sound that signifies that Mama is near is the cracking of bones. The movie created a scene that is similar to the Hangar 51 scene at the end of Indiana Jones: Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981). The atmosphere of the storage on both scenes was similar where it shows that any of the boxes in storage holds their individual mysteries.<br/><br/>Mama (2013) is different from the recent horror movies where blood, gore, and a madman were the main way to scare the audience. Mama (2013) is your classic psychological horror where jump scares, eerie environments and sounds dominate the scene. Mama (2013) is a must see for any lover of psychological thriller."
