","Just got back from an advanced screening that was the (according to the director) first screening seen by people outside of the cast/crew of the movie. Overall I was very impressed, having never read the book I did not really know what to expect. Acting was good, nothing Oscar worthy but no poor performances. Everyone did their job well, especially Benjamin Walker and Dominic Cooper. They both excelled in their roles as Lincoln and Henry respectively. Plot flowed well and was easy to follow, and the action was absolutely fantastic. It was over the top, fast paced, bloody, and very well done. If you don't mind seeing vampires getting hacked, slashed, and bashed to death in a wide variety of ways, you'll enjoy this movie."
"piranha-army","6","14","17","18 October 2012"," A different tale on the life of Abraham Lincoln.
","This movie was surprisingly entertaining, which I doubted when I saw the trailer. It begins slow but steadily gains speed throughout the film. Though it doesn't get as good as a good vampire film should, it offers a fictional story with a non-fictional setting and characters. Benjamin Walker gives a good performance as the president who believes in vampires. Dominic Cooper as Henry was OK but could of been better. Mary Elizabeth Winstead I believe was miscast in her role as Mary Todd, she was too young for me too believe her as an older Mary Todd. Other than that the film was generally entertaining if leading away to boring conversation parts. The fight scenes are done well and the weapon of choice: An Axe, which is well used in this film. If you like Abraham Lincoln and you like Vampires then you will love this movie!. Thanks for reading and enjoy the Film."

","Supposedly, the beginnings of Vampires in America and a story about Honest Abe (Benjamin Walker) as he hunts them down before becoming our 16th president. <br/><br/>I had no idea who Benjamin Walker is. Anyone? Yes, I suspected, but had never heard the truth that Abraham Lincoln was a Vampire Hunter..until now. And, now you will too, if you watch this movie. I can hear you asking, ""is it all true"" Well, of course, it is. Hollywood wouldn't make up something if it weren't true now, would they? And, yes, they are finally admitting the truth about Edgar Allen Poe being a detective who wrote poems on his stake-outs. But, on to Abe..as a Vampire Hunter.<br/><br/>But first, before you turn away from this one, let me tell you of 2-scenes that are worth your time. The first one is a battle between Abe and Vampire Jack Barts (Marton Csokas) on horses in a horse stampede. Yes, that's right. In a horse stampede. The way this was done was nothing short of fantastic and you will ask yourself "" how in the world did they do this?"" The second one is near the end on a burning bridge the train is crossing. Unbelievable how they did this. Again, you will ask yourself ""how in the world did they do this?"" They took CGI to a new level. You will be talking about these two scenes for a long time. Kudos, kudos and kudos again. <br/><br/>The entire production, photography, dialogues were all first rate as were the actors within. The music was spot on especially with the train near the end chug-chugging in time with the beat. Excellent.<br/><br/>Yes, there is some gore as Abe settles in to become the Vampire Hunter we know and love, and his weapon of choice is an Axe. Hey, he was a rail-splitter at one time. Keep up.<br/><br/>Abe is befriended by Henry (Dominic Cooper) who teaches him how to kill Vampires. But, waitHenry has a secret.<br/><br/>The main villain Vampire is Adam played by Rufus Sewell and he is always good. And, we learn how the battle for Gettysburg was really won. Yes, the North won but now you will learn how they did it. Never before told.<br/><br/>One more thing: finally, someone decided on a Mary Todd Lincoln (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) who is easy on the eyes. Good choice. And, yes, Benjamin Walker makes a good Lincoln especially with the beard later on in the movie. <br/><br/>It's true, I didn't want to see this movie much less do a review on it. A friend I won't name (Russ) recommended it and thanks to him I discovered the truth and it set me free. Now, I know all. Will you? (7/10)<br/><br/>Violence: Throughout Sex: No. Gore: Yes, there is some. Nudity: Yes, quick shot of a dead woman with a breast exposed. Language: Only two f-bombs were heard. Otherwise no language at all. (7/10)"

","I didn't have high expectations of this film due solely to it's title. How wrong I was! This is a popcorn movie of the best sort. Ridiculously over the top but in a very entertaining way.<br/><br/>The action doesn't stop from the get go and there's a narrative that runs through the whole movie that keeps you interested.<br/><br/>The SFX are impressive too.<br/><br/>Performances are good, particularly Rufus Sewell who plays a very good villain.

"DoctorRabbit","8","161","251","23 June 2012"," A Fun Action Flick That Delivers On Exactly What It Promises
","Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is exactly what you would expect from the title. A ridiculous, over-the-top, and fun action-horror flick. The serious tone and silly premise may turn off some people, but the serious tone actually works to the films advantage and actually made the movie more fun. I actually think a goofy and comedic tone could've hurt the films in some ways by being a bit too tongue and cheek. The action scenes were well done and incredibly entertaining to watch. The final action scene was actually worth the price of admission alone. I also enjoyed how they included actual parts of Lincoln's history into the film. Benjamin Walker also surprisingly did a good job as Lincoln. The dialogue is corny but I actual think that played as a strength to a film rather than a weakness. The 3D effects are also used very well in the film and delivers a good mix of depth and gimmicky moments and really enhanced the action sequences. I would highly recommend seeing the film in 3D if you have the option. If I had any complaints it would be that I did feel like the film dragged a bit in the middle.<br/><br/>Overall, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is a fun flick that delivers on exactly what it promises. Abraham Lincoln kicking vampire ass! If you don't go in holding the films premise against it, than you'll have a blast with it!"
"AmicusCurie2000","8","98","157","11 June 2012"," Definitely worth watching! Lincoln comes alive.
","I too was a skeptic of the title. I got to watch the movie and was surprised by how quickly it hooked me. Cast and director make characters believable and story plausible. Benjamin Walker does a superb job of playing Lincoln. He really makes the character come to life. Great mix of fantasy and reality. The story respects Lincoln the man and Lincoln the president. If your a history buff you won't be disappointed. The movie moves along at a good pace. Plenty of action. The director does a fine job of making a believable story of one of the greatest and most beloved presidents in American history. A lot of the scenes and camera shots are unique and really bring you into the story instead of just being a bystander. The group I was with really enjoyed the movie. The time spent suspending belief is well worth it."
"udoricht","7","23","33","22 October 2012"," What did you expect to see more?
","If you take this movie so serious you'll be disappointed 'cause it's not. But if you take it as fun movie, fulled of action/fantasy/horror scenes and as what it is then you can give it a chance. Maybe, the character of Abraham Lincoln defined as vampire slayer is naive and childish and is not what you expected to see for historical important figure. Maybe someone thinks that this is disgrace for the character. And finally maybe someone thinks there is a storyline abstraction 'cause the book is better and I don't doubt that even I haven't read it. All this defects are not so important if you like movies in this kind of genre like Underworld, Resident Evil etc. This was a movie that deserves attention and give it a try."
"neil-476","8","70","114","22 June 2012"," A complete hoot
","As a Brit, my knowledge of Abraham Lincoln is limited to stovepipe hat and beard, the Civil War, abolition of slavery, and assassination at the theatre by John Wilkes Booth. I had absolutely no idea that he had enjoyed a career (prior to his entry into politics) as a vampire slayer, nor that there had been a large contingent of vampires within the Confederate army. Thank heavens Lincoln left behind his notebook, or we'd never have known.<br/><br/>Benjamin Walker, an actor I have never heard of, but who looks very much like a young Liam Neeson, plays young Lincoln (and, with old makeup and a sticky-on beard, old Lincoln) in a batch of preposterous nonsense in which our hero become expert at whirling around a silver-bladed axe, surviving horrific physical trauma, decapitating vampires, chatting up Mary Elizabeth Winstead, starting the Civil War, and melting down everyone's silver into musket balls in order to defeat the 1st Confederate Vampire Infantry Regiment. In this he is assisted by a decent roster of support including Dominic Cooper, Rupert Sewell, the afore-mentioned Miss Winstead, Anthony Machie and Jimmi Speed.<br/><br/>All those involved play this nonsense with an absolutely straight face - indeed, it would not work if they played it tongue in cheek - but, notwithstanding the seriousness with which the characters are portrayed, and the slow motion decapitations and vampiric (black) blood sprays, this film is a romp. Like director Timur Bekmambetov's earlier Wanted, it is an unexpected and exuberant batch of utter twaddle, made with an almost palpable glee. And, also like Wanted, it features some beautifully choreographed and eye-boggling action.<br/><br/>This movie is hugely enjoyable and absolutely daft. And the 3D is often very effective."

","This film is freaking awesome, fun and a great time! Why in the heck does it have below a 6/10 on here? Are people seriously stupid enough to think that this piece of entertainment and satire is honestly depicting historical events in full or semi-full accuracy? What's wrong with you people? No really. Someone message me and explain the massive hate around this because I can not see what is wrong. This is pure fiction. Is there something disrespectful here that I am missing? Anyway, this is a fun piece of fiction with mostly great action, good acting and a great script. The film moves along nicely and there is never a dull moment. It is a 7/10 kind of film but I'm going to give it a 10/10 to offset the madness."
"toqtaqiya2","8","36","57","28 November 2012"," A terrific action summer movie with a fresh visual style.
","After watching Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter at home I asked myself why I didn't go to see it in a movie theater during the summer. I should have but I guess the reason was that I thought the premise was silly. Too bad because this is a terrific action film. It's very entertaining but I stress that it's not dumb. All the actors deliver good performances. Benjamin Walker creates a fantastic hero in Abraham Lincoln, a secret vampire hunter and the 16th President of the United States. Walker is good in the action scenes as well as at delivering Lincoln's historic lines. He begins hunting vampires as a young man with the assistance of his mentor Henry Sturges (Dominic Cooper). Mary Elizabeth Winstead plays Lincoln's wife Mary Todd and Anthony Mackie plays his closest friend William Johnson. Rufus Sewell as Adam is the film's main antagonist, a powerful vampire with an interesting story. The film is based on Seth Grahame-Smith's mashup novel of the same name. It plays very much like a comic book movie, and it takes liberties with the facts of Lincoln's life while poking fun at some of them. Director Timur Bekmambetov has a talent for creating impressive visuals, but here with the assistance of cinematographer Caleb Deschanel the look of the film is often stunning. The scene in which Lincoln fights Jack Barts on horseback at sunset is just one amazing highlight. Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter earned almost twice its budget at the box office but it should have been a bigger hit. It's serious fantasy horror. I won't be surprised if it becomes a cult movie. It's one of the best films of 2012, and I definitely recommend seeing it."
"aaronjbong","7","83","143","20 June 2012"," A Different Side of Abraham Lincoln
","When I discovered this movie, skepticism washed over me. I mean, Abraham Lincoln as a vampire hunter? Having one of the greatest presidents of all time as the character of a vampire hunter would be the last thing anyone would expect. When I entered the theater, my initial thought was that this movie would bring me disappointment. But it turned out to be much better than expected and a fun film filled with lots of violence, blood, gore, and vampire decapitations.<br/><br/>So, in the film adaptation of Seth Grahame-Smith's fantasy novel, Abraham Lincoln is a vampire hunter. But before he becomes that, he's just an ordinary boy living in a world consumed by slavery. One night, his mom died from an undiscovered disease and from then on, he's waited and searched for his mom's killer, only to discover a new large world of vampires. There he becomes a vampire hunter under the guidance of Henry Sturges (who has a secret).<br/><br/>However, his vampire hunting career reaches a hiatus in the middle of a movie where Abraham is now interested in pursuing a career in politics. In the end, he becomes the President of the United States, only to have his career troubled by the devastating Civil War where vampires play a part in it somehow. In the 20 or so minutes that focus on his presidency, I felt there was an issue with it as it shifted the focus of vampire hunting and focused on politics and the Civil War instead as nothing about vampires was stated during this 20 minutes.<br/><br/>The vampires are led by a leader named Adam. Although he might appear to be the strongest, I felt that the vampire John Barts (killer of Abraham's mother) was actually the main antagonist of the film and represented a bigger threat. While Adam had a lengthy climax, the fight with John Barts was much longer and was more personal as only the two of them were involved and more engaging. The scene also displayed more of the abilities possessed by a vampire.<br/><br/>Talking about action scenes, they were all great and fantastic. They were energetic, full of blood, full of gore, extremely violent, and dead brutal. Most of them feature decapitations of the vampires and anyone seeking brutality, deadliness, blood, gore, and violence should be satisfied with the action scenes provided here. But what I noticed in the action scenes, particularly the Lincoln-Barts fight and parts of the climax, was that it was quite unclear. In the Lincoln-Barts fight, the two were in a sandy place with many horses galloping. I felt that there was too much sand flying around and the fight became unclear and a bit brownish. This made it hard to see what was going on. It might intentionally done like that to give it more of an old feeling but it may also be a distraction because you don't know what's going on. The same happened in parts of the climax but this time, smoke and sparks caused it.<br/><br/>The script was a bit uneven. While the second half of the film was a bit better, I felt that the first half of the film was a bit lacking in dialog. There was little talk and there was too many decapitations, blood, and gore. I felt that the scenes progressed too fast and they should have taken it more patiently. In fact, most of the talk in the first part of the film comes from Abraham, due in part to the narration of fragments of his diary. The others rarely talk and probably only talk so little and it's only by the second half that they talk more. However, the performances by the actors were okay, not too terrible to burden the overall movie experience.<br/><br/>I also felt there was a bit of a disaster with the make-up. Since the time in the story spans from Abraham's early adulthood to his fifties, we could clearly see a change in his facial appearance (a beard). We can also see this change with Abraham's friend Joshua Speed. The same cannot be said with Abraham's wife Mary Todd, and Abraham's other friend Will Johnson. Mary Todd doesn't appear to change with the exception of very few creases on her face whereas Will Johnson doesn't have a change in appearance at all. His face is exactly the same his hair didn't even turn white. <br/><br/>However, the 3D was excellent. It takes you and makes you part of the scenes and is recommended although some of the scenes would make the 3D a nuisance. But other scenes where there is blood will be enhanced by the 3D and some of the blood may even squirt out to your face. And the visual effects! Oh they're such a wonder. But of course, impressive visual effects and eye-catching stunts would be what you would expect from a movie directed by Timur Bekmambetov.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" is a film that offers moviegoers a fun time with plenty of bloody and gory action sequences filled with eye-catching stunts, impressive visual effects and excellent 3D effects. Despite the interesting plot, the film is downed by some poor unclear shots, an uneven script that mostly focused on action, not on dialog, and poor make-up. Regardless, ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" is a movie you should see if you want a bloody fun time.<br/><br/>Rating: 7/10 <br/><br/>Final Verdict: Despite the uneven script, some poor unclear shots, and poor make-up, ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" promises moviegoers a bloody fun time with gory action scenes, eye-catching stunts, impressive visual effects, and excellent 3D effects with an interesting and somehow peculiar plot line."

","When I first heard about this film, I wasn't that interested. It didn't seem like it would be that good to watch. How wrong I was. As I had missed watching it in the cinema, I had to wait until it was released on DVD. In that time, I honestly could not wait. I constantly watched the trailers for it, tried to avoid any plot details in case of spoilers, and even looked up on some of the cast members I hadn't heard of before, including Mr Lincoln himself, Benjamin Walker. I got it the week it came out, and I didn't regret it. As well as fun yet exciting action scenes, the acting was just perfect from the majority of the cast, especially Walker, Dominic Cooper and Rufus Sewell. It also references Lincoln's actual life as a President very effectively as well as including this secret life as a vampire hunter. I also enjoyed the soundtrack, mainly because of Linkin Park's 'Powerless' being featured at the end but all the other songs went very well with the scenes, too. It may sound like a weird film but to me, it's one of the most unique films made in a long time. A combination of horror, action and even some elements of comedy and romance make this a big thumbs up on my films list."

","Abe Lincoln Vampire Slayer is nothing short of a masterpiece. The cinematography alone is enough to make me recommend this movie to anyone who appreciates being visually amused. Every scene is so shockingly detailed that occasionally I found myself paying more attention to the floating dust particles than the movie itself, which was incredibly impressive. I remember how excited I was to see that Burton was a part of this movie, because then it was guaranteed to be the work of art that it is. While still being somewhat historically accurate, the story is interesting with twists that I hadn't anticipated. The action scenes were so original and intense that they had me stunned. I literally was in awe (eyes wide with a big smile) at the brilliance of every sight. My expectations for this movie were dangerously high, but I was still so impressed that I wanted to stand up and applaud. I had so much fun that I didn't want it to end, and I will go back to see it again and again. I passionately recommend this movie to everyone that is capable of appreciating it."

"thecinnamonkid85","2","120","230","22 June 2012"," Ridiculous
","It's funny how I created an account for this website just to tell people how awful this movie was. I had the benefit of seeing this movie before it came out last night at my work, and even I felt like I was being cheated out of time and money. I can't imagine paying to see this film. <br/><br/>Now, obviously I wasn't expecting a serious film. With the title, I expected an entertaining film with a lot of blood, gore, and action sequences. This movie however, tried to be so much more, while retaining a ridiculous plot and ludicrous action sequences. Every fight scene was either poorly crafted or so unbelievably stupid I almost walked out of a movie I didn't even have to pay for. The plot itself was also terrible. Characters barely introduced somehow become relevant, and acting was so bad at parts I laughed at the actors/actresses. It seemed like the only character who aged was Abe, characters such as Mary Todd's fiancé just disappear, and every single one liner from the beginning of the film is repeated. You know, that can work. Spider-Man's classic ""With great power comes great responsibility"" was okay. But when the characters repeat 6 or 7 different lines it gets old. fast. <br/><br/>If you can't help yourself, then go see this film. I was intrigued by the title and hoped to see Abe kick some ass. But this film is just so outright ridiculous. I feel like I've said that word way too many times, but it's the only word to describe it. Abe goes from a frail and tall guy to an axe swinging backflipping badass without anymore training than chopping down a tree (which was also a poorly done scene). I don't even think I can say something good about this film, other than the idea. This movie could have been very entertaining had it not lost total sense of reality and human capability. I found myself yelling ""as if"" multiple times during the film. If you don't believe me, see it for yourself."
"H_Spengler","1","97","188","1 July 2012"," An insulting slap in the face
","I didn't go to this movie expecting Oscar winning caliber, I did want to be entertained, even in a ""turn your brain off"" way. I understand that more often than not when books are adapted into movies, things are changed, cut for time/story, etc. Preserving the main idea of a story can be done even implementing this method without the nuclear meltdown that occurred with this adaptation.<br/><br/>I LOVED the book. I loved the way time was taken to carefully develop the characters & story, & weave them into coordination with true historical facts, & events.<br/><br/>I'm not saying this needed to be ""Batman Begins"", i'm willing to accept the fact that studios aren't willing to provide unlimited funds for films they might consider ""going out on a limb.""<br/><br/>This movie would've been great if it had gone one of two ways: A goofy, campy, slaying story in the spirit of Sam Raimi's ""Evil Dead"" series (which I thoroughly enjoy). Or, if it had closely followed the tone & story of the novel. This movie did neither of those. The ONLY resemblance to the book are some character's names. <br/><br/>Here are my quarrels: <br/><br/>1.) A completely changed & rushed back story. What was so carefully plotted out in the book & gradually developed both story & character wise (so you can feel for Abe, his plight, motivations, feelings, & destiny) is now a completely different story with omissions of important characters, events, situations, mindsets, emotions, etc. & the addition of characters & situations not in the book. <br/><br/>It's rushed through in approximately 5 minutes, leaving you wondering why you should give a crap at all. You have no connection with Abe, or any other character for that matter. I was actually stunned. <br/><br/>2.) There's a training sequence that's laughable, & approximately 3 minutes long, with some of the worst CGI ever.<br/><br/>3.) Henry. His back story is unfortunately butchered & laughably unbelievable. As is his initial meeting (and ensuing friendship) with Abe. Gone is his meticulous nature, and important contributions to the story, and left is a husk of the character from the book.<br/><br/>4.) And what's this crap about vampires can't kill their own? And how vampires are made vampires? The explanation for how vampires are made vampires is so ridiculous, you'll want to puncture your own eardrums for having heard it. <br/><br/>5.) Continuing omission of key characters & events which continually leave you detached from any characters or the story. Adam, & the female vampire (? name) are a prime example of additional made up characters shoe horned in the movie. If they had followed the original story they would have had more than enough material without needing to invent these two silly, cardboard characters,<br/><br/>6.) Continuous, unemotional, passionless, mind numbingly repetitive ""Matrix"" like slow motion vampire killing scenes. Silly fight in a herd of wild running horses....horse ""tossing"". <br/><br/>7.) Silly subplot about silver. It's not ever in the book as being harmful, or the making of weapons from them. (PS: writers...stop putting silver in vampire movies, save it for the werewolves.)<br/><br/>8.) Mary Todd was never savvy to what her husband was up to. But here, less believably, distributing silver weapons out in the battlefield, where she could then have a stupid scene where she shoots the female (name?) vampire, who is running at her with full ""Ahhhhhhh!!"" battle cry. <br/><br/>But I guess the ""writers"" figured they needed to amp it up & give her a scene where she does something.<br/><br/>9.) I'm confused as to what happened at the end. Who is it in the bar? Why couldn't they just have had the ending they had in the book? The ending in the film reminds me of that ending from ""Interview with the Vampire"" with Tom Cruise telling Christian Slater he's going to give him the choice he never had. Cheesy.<br/><br/>Imagine my shock to find out that Seth Grahame-Smith was involved with the screenplay. SHAME ON YOU SETH! Did you have little creative control, or did you not care & sell out completely??!! <br/><br/>Tim Burton should hang his head in shame too (even though he hasn't been involved with a quality flick since ""Sleepy Hollow"")(with the ""possible"" exception of ""Sweeney Todd"".) <br/><br/>In my showing there was a group of gabby tweens who literally burst into giggles every time something happened on screen. Most of the time it was something that wasn't meant to be funny, but due to the nature of this ""film"" -was. Normally this behavior annoys me, but I couldn't even get annoyed with them, as it was justified.<br/><br/>So what did I like you might ask? If you're still reading. Well, I liked Benjamin Walker as I thought he looked the part, especially in Abe's later years, & he tried. But due to poor writing, and equally poor direction, his performance throughout the film is uneven and shockingly wooden as Abe in his younger years.<br/><br/>I liked Dominic Cooper as Henry, who like Walker, did the best he could with the crappy material and direction, at least he had a little more passion in his performance. It's not his fault the script sucked.<br/><br/>I liked that the vampires didn't sparkle.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed or have any respect for the book this is ""based"" on, I urge you to refrain from spending your hard earned money on a vastly overpriced ticket. You have been warned."

And even the trailers and promos of this film were kind of okay-ish but not exactly charming enough to drop-your-jaw. <br/><br/>Until I SAW this film. <br/><br/>I guess that should be more than enough to say anything about this movie. Spielberg better pull up his socks. His upcoming biographical saga on Lincoln will need something out of the blue to convince his audience that Lincoln was just a normal president with a beard and not ...you know what. Wanted took my expectation level to a stratospheric high. With this movie the level has rocketed to the exosphere. Wanted 2 better be that good Mr Bekmambetov. P.S.:Timur is one guy who hell sure knows how to make a film look and sound better than its trailer, one quality which film-makers seldom achieve. (Or maybe that's his trick!)"
"Pumpkin_Man","8","13","20","25 June 2012"," What Your History Teacher Never Told You!!!
","This movie started off pretty slow, but got better toward the middle. It was a great blend of horror and political history. You can tell it's based on a graphic novel because of the often bright colors, slow-motion action fight scenes, and cgi gore, but it was still fun. When Abe Lincoln's mother is killed, he vows revenge against the man who did it. When he finds out the killer was a vampire, he's trained by Henry Sturgess to become a fearless vampire hunter. I like the last half of the movie better because Lincoln looks more like himself that we know with the beard. Will Lincoln be able to free the slaves, stop the war, and kill all the vampires during his Presidency? I'd definitely recommend ABRAHAM LINCOLN: VAMPIRE HUNTER!!!"

","This movie has to be 1 of the best movies of the 2012. Great action movie. The actors and actress hired for this movie were great. They impressed me. The people in the movie theater also loved it. It seems to me this movie is very underrated. The most satisfied thing about this movie was that the real Vampires were back. It was good to see this after all that Twilight nonsense. The vampires in this movie were ruthless as i wanted it to be. They feasted on human flesh. But something bothered me a bit. I thought silver can only be used to kill the wolf-man but no the vampires. But overall a great movie. Had a great time with friends. I would also recommend people to read the book as well. It is also really good. I would rate this movie: 9/10"

","I loved this book! The details in the book about Abraham's younger years, the historical facts and dates - loved it all. The characters around Abraham were very real and important to the story (in my opinion). <br/><br/>Spoilers follow:<br/><br/>The movie was NOTHING like the book. The characters were different except for their names and some didn't show up at all. The events that made it from the book to the move were out of order in the movie. The details mentioned above - non- existent in the movie. The story was so choppy, leaving out huge portions of events. I am aware that not everything can be translated to a movie in a timely manner; however, it can be done far better than it was done in this movie.<br/><br/>I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this movie. Don't waste your time/money. Read the book - it is so much better."
"xophr","1","45","90","2 July 2012"," A complete insult
","Warning: Contains some spoilers, but not anything that would ruin it for you. (This is not to say the movie wasn't ruined to begin with)<br/><br/>I don't even know where to begin with this movie. After wasting money a few years ago on another hyped up movie that turned out to be complete crap, I promised myself I would never spend full price on movies anymore until they came to my local $2 theater. There was one move in which I broke my promise which was The Dark Knight and I was satisfied, but for the most part I avoided movies particular new releases at all costs. <br/><br/>I did all of this until Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter was released. I was familiar with the story ever since the book was released many months earlier, and I finally get around to getting the book the Saturday after the movie release and completed it the following Friday. I really loved the book and while a fictional story, the historical information in the book was accurate including Lincoln's family, his sons, birth and dates of death. In addition the Civil War accounts were also accurate in terms of dates and outcomes. The book did a really good job tying in the story of vampires into the real life of Abraham Lincoln and this nation. <br/><br/>I was real excited to see the movie after finishing the book, and while I expected the movie to not follow the book exactly, perhaps omitting some aspects and combining characters, I did at least expect it to be much better than it was. On the contrary I found this movie to be quite insulting and terribly done. Once again a Hollywood movie jumps the shark and completes an utter disaster of overdone action scenes, needless characters and an unbelievable story. Its one thing to deviate a little from the book, but its a complete other thing to throw all of the things that made the book great out of the window and replace it with a steaming pile of crap such as this. The book was tortured, butchered and beheaded just as the unfortunate vampires Lincoln would encounter and destroy during his life.<br/><br/>It only took 10 minutes into the movie to realize that this was going to be a disaster. The only thing they got sort of right was the death of Abraham's mother when he was a little boy, but from that point on, everything was completely different. I don't mind the story being changed somewhat, but if you are going to change something at least make it worthwhile. The producers were so preoccupied with creating needless and overdone action scenes, they completely threw historical accuracy out the window. Without giving away too many spoilers, I must point out that the date of death of Thomas Lincoln (Abe's father) was wrong in the movie, the movie also completely ignored Robert Todd, Eddie, and Thomas (Tad) Lincoln. (Lincoln's other 3 sons). Henry, who was Lincoln's mysterious and one of his strongest allies in the book was reduced so some young Tom Cruise like character who was weak, unconvincing and boring. Mary Todd Lincoln who was psychologically weak in the book (and in real life); and understandably so, due to the death of her sons, turned into some powerful Joan of Arc wanna be which was also unconvincing. The movie also added two completely unnecessary main antagonists who were not in the book. These characters were your typical Hollywood a-hole bada$$es and added NOTHING to the story except to make it even worse than it already was. The story itself jumped around so much and seemed the producers' only goal was to rush through the back stories just so they could get to more action scenes. I could go on all day of how many things I hated about this movie but I will end my many gripes here and only say that the final action scene was complete crap, but what should I expect I suppose. <br/><br/>I guess it was my fault for expecting a quality movie when I should know by now Hollywood treats us American viewers as mindless Neanderthals who can only respond to non-stop action and cheesy overdone special effects and constant violence. This is not to say that the book wasn't violent, but I found the violence in the book to be much more believable than the movie which would just splash CGI blood every time Lincoln encountered a vampire.<br/><br/>I guess if you are a teenager who hasn't read the book or one who can't yet appreciate what it takes to make a movie both exciting and thought provoking, will absolutely love this movie. Older people on the other hand I suspect will find this movie quite insulting not only to the book, but to American history in general. As the crowd sat in complete silence, probably as disappointed and shocked as I was on how bad this movie was, I saw on the screen that one of the executive producers was Seth Grahame-Smith the author of the book. Such irony and such a shame that he can write such a good book, but then contribute to a disaster like this. I'm going to try my best to wipe this movie completely out my mind and from this point on I will re-promise myself not watch another movie in the theater until it comes to the $2 theater.<br/><br/>I don't give out 1 star review for anything too often, but I really can't find any redeeming quality that would push it up to two stars. So I will leave it at one. Probably not the worst movie I've seen, but its pretty close."
"aawnc","10","7","10","29 October 2012"," Much better then first
","I watched this movie after seeing a trailer for it. Before that I made fun of the posters and idea of Abe Lincoln killing Vampires. I avoided Buffy the Vampire Slayer for the same reasons and when I finally watched them they became one of my favorite series. All that said if you watched A L vs Zombies and think this movie will let you down as that one did, watch it. The difference between the two is night and day. Vampires has a much larger budget and is produced by Tim Burton. I guess he saw the potential and picked up the project. It was full of action, special effects where on point, and the far fetched premise was made beleiveable enough as any vampire movie can be. The actor who played AL kicked butt and the fight scenes where awesome. The entire cast was quality. I believe this is a cult classic franchise in the making and would certainly watch the next, what ever it maybe assuming Tim Burton stays involved with the project. Skip the zombies and watch the vampires."
"savaget","1","36","71","29 June 2012"," sooooo disappointed
","I fully expect the movie not to be as good as the book. that being said. Wow did this one fall short. I was hoping since the screenwriter and the Author of the book is the same person a fan of the book may become a fan of the movie. I doubt I would have seen this otherwise, and now after seeing this movie I wish I hadn't. I was at first disappointed but after milling it around for a day I am actually a little upset. Mr. Seth Grahme-Smith. why when you have such an opportunity to do a film from book justice did you totally screw this one up? The only character that slightly resembles a character from a fantastically written book is Abraham Lincoln. Henry comes off as weak when he tried to talk president Lincoln out of fighting the civil war He was actually a driving force for the civil war. And Adam where did he come from? where was Edgar Allen Poe? and vampires could kill other vampires. in the end of the book when Abraham Lincoln is still around during the JFK presidency he is still killing vampires. and in the movie Lincoln is supernatural. but in the book he trained very hard and still was only able to kill one vampire at a time and usually with help and the element of surprise. but yet now he is able to hack them down while running on the backs of horses I know vampires aren't real so I shouldn't expect too much realism, but how is it a vampire can grab a horse running full speed and toss him at a mortal man and not kill said man. and then when they are grappling how is it that this same horse heaving vampire should struggle at all to bite Abraham's head off, just ridiculous. you never understand why Abraham Lincoln has such a hatred for vampires it would help if you could add that vampires killed is grandfather, his mother his sister, his first love, his boys, and were responsible for missing children all up and down the Mississippi river all of those things happened before Lincoln even knew about them harvesting slaves. I could go on for days. suffice th to say if you like a good slasher film. put this one down on your list with the likes of all the scream movies, chainsaw massacre, Halloween, Friday the 13th nightmare on elm street etc..."
"ponder-lauren","1","35","69","23 June 2012"," Huge Disappointment!!!!!
","1. For those who have read the book:<br/><br/>This movie should not even have the honor of having the same title as the book. There are approximately 4 characters that are the same, and that is just because of their names. The storyline is in no way similar to the book. <br/><br/>All movies that are based on book face the criticism of those who have read the book. The usual is that some things are left out due to a time constraint, a scene or two may be added in for Hollywood drama, or characters may look different due to the expectations of movie goers...This movie does not follow the usual. There is literally nothing that is the same. The characters personalities and intentions are completely different, there is a storyline that runs throughout the movie that does not exist in the book, and there is a ""main"" character in the movie that Does Not exist in the book. It is a disgrace that the author of the book would create a screenplay that does not only do injustice to the book, but is Not even similar to the book. <br/><br/>2. For those who have not read the book:<br/><br/>If you have not read the book, then storyline does not matter near as much because you don't know what happened. From a movie standpoint, the acting is sub-par, the CGI is Terrible, and the production (of which I was sadly disappointed in Tim Burton) was choppy and looks like it could have been done by a high school student. All in all it is a movie that is not worthing watching, let alone pay for. <br/><br/>Disappointing."
"Alise_shenle","10","8","12","6 July 2012"," A for AWESOME
","Let me just clarify, I am not a rabid fan of the book or author. I only knew Abe Lincoln based on his inspiring failures. Being a teenager, I like vampire and zombie flicks, but I was a bit wary of actually seeing a historical figure mash up. So, I decided to watch this movie in 3D since there was nothing else good at the moment. Actually, besides the title, there is nothing funny about this movie. The 3D was actually quite bright (unlike SOME movies) and the medieval settings pretty to see. The actors and actresses were tall and goodlooking. And now that I think about it, it is very possible that Abe COULD be a fighting sort of guy. When the action starts, we get slow motion and close ups of black goo which is quite tense and scary. The good guys are not always good at fighting (look at Speed) and we are all kept on the edge of our seats. My friend guessed wrongly that either Mary or Will are vampires, when actually it's someone else, so this film is so not predictable. Although many answers were not explained, such as how come some people die after being bitten while others turned, it all makes for a mysterious ride. There are many throwbacks to previous things that made sense. Etc the pocket watch, lines such as ""History prefers legends to men"", ""a man only gets this drunk when he wants to woo a girl or kill a man"", and ""we are all slaves"" repeated at the start and the end, all were a nice way to present the continuity. Abe might be dead, but his legacy lived on, there will always be people willing to stand up against darkness. The jokes were also really funny. Of course if you're a history nut you would hate this movie, but if you want BELIEVABLE action (no flying kungfu), mature romance (none of that teenage angst), comedy and, thriller, you should watch this. Much better than other vampire flicks coming up (etc Breaking Dawn Part 2) or 3D films (Prometheus)."
"anastasiaeb","1","41","83","26 June 2012"," So disappointing...
","If you've read the book, you'll be completely disappointed with this movie. I've read articles about the movie (after reading the book) and knew they were adding characters, but I had no idea they would change EVERYTHING. I understand shortening the story to fit into a movie, but more than that has been done and now the movie is just stupid! I can't even say there's more action in the movie than the book, EVERY action scene had the super-fast-with-the-hands/weapons-dance-but-slow-down- just-when-a-blow-connects/misses; and the ""bass drop"" or BRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA­AAAAWM sound (like Inception) during all the action scenes didn't help. Oh yeah, the excessive CGI and most of the acting sucked. It was like some of the actors just walked in front of the camera and said the lines like they really didn't want to be there. When I first heard about this movie I thought it was the dumbest thing ever, but then I read the book thoroughly enjoyed it and became excited about the movie...only to be let down and forced to stick with my initial thought. If someone else hadn't paid for the tickets I would've walked out and demanded a refund, even the person who took me thought it sucked and he never read the book but was also excited about the movie. Save your money and wait until it comes out on cable."
"KnightSolaire","10","9","14","26 June 2012"," Superb action scenes and performances make this one a killer.
","Going in knowing nothing about the flick except it was called, well... you know what, and that it was based on a novel of the same name, I expected no more than some cheesy CGI mediocrity.<br/><br/>Boy, was I wrong.<br/><br/>Let's start with the best thing about the movie: the action scenes. Timur Bekmambetov executes the action in ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" with stunning and extremely satisfying flourish, akin to Zack Snyder's ""300"" from 2006. Slow-mo shots aplenty, and vampire blood flowing across the screen, the action never lets up in its excitement or pace throughout the whole film. <br/><br/>What really surprised me was the extreme effectiveness of the film as a historical drama, with great performances put in by all the lead roles. While at first I was a bit skeptical as Benjamin Walker looked a bit like the poor man's Benedict Cumberbatch, but I was blown away how Walker simply became Abraham Lincoln. Both the actor and the make-up department deserve special credit for bringing the 16th president to the big screen. Dominic Cooper was also very memorable in his role as the ""trainer"" of Honest Abe, and was always a pleasure to watch on-screen.<br/><br/>The movie's pace is always consistent, and always generates excitement, be it through the simply outstanding action scenes, or the more dramatic ones. Originally, I thought a more humorous tongue-in-cheek would be appropriate for a movie like this, but I definitely would agree that the serious tone that the film employed definitely worked to its advantage by so seamlessly interweaving real-life history with the vampire mythos. <br/><br/>All in all, the movie blew away my expectations. If you're in for some simply awesome vampire-slaying action, or even if you're into the historical aspect of Abraham Lincoln, the film delivers on every level. Definitely do not miss up on one of the best summer flicks of 2012."
"dmgreer","9","9","14","24 June 2012"," I hate vampire movies, but I loved this one
","One way I measure a film's success is by the feeling I have when I leave the theater. If my head is still in the framework of the movie after I leave, then I deem it to have been successful, at least on some level. After Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter it was still in my head during the drive to my friend's house, where we all met afterward and discussed it at some length, another sign of success.<br/><br/>I usually hate vampires in movies because most of the time they're just a cheap plot prop appealing to narcissistic types. But in this movie they're a cheap plot prop to weave a tale purporting to explain everything about Abe Lincoln and the US Civil War. In some ways it reminded me of Dick, the movie about the Watergate Scandal where ""Deep Throat"" turns out to be two teenage girls, and many of the veiled happenings of that scandal happen to have been caused by Betsy and Arlene, one way or another.<br/><br/>To really appreciate Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter in that respect, it helps to know something about US history leading up to and during the Civil War. At the very least, you should look up Harriet Tubman, Jefferson Davis, and Gettysburg in Wikipedia before seeing the movie.<br/><br/>Bekmembatov manages to pack a good deal of history, dialog, action, and story telling into this movie. The acting it mostly good, though Mary Elizabeth Winstead's performance as Mary Todd Lincoln seemed uneven. Sometimes she was adequate, other times she was spitting her lines out too quickly, as do many pretty young women when playing this kind of historical role.<br/><br/>The script veers between using fairly accurate language, to complete anachronism, like ""How'd that work out for ya?!"" But you know, the story is about how Abe Lincoln was killing vampires, so yeah.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the sets, costumes, and other artwork seemed historically accurate and some of the CGI provides a new look at that era. There's a scene of the Mississippi River at New Orleans full of paddle wheel riverboats that lingers with me.<br/><br/>So in the end I turned out liking the vampire prop, and the bad-ass Lincoln as portrayed by Benjamin Walker."

A must see!<br/><br/>They didn't mess around with the history too much. They showed Abe as a young boy - briefly. They moved on and showed you the strength behind Abe Lincoln and the family man. Not just the President. <br/><br/>I found the special effects were similar to 300...which I thoroughly enjoyed.<br/><br/>I see that this movie has an average of 6 out of 10 stars. I have no idea why.

I hate over-the-top car chase scenes and slow-mo fight scenes (and, yes, vampires, too), but add that to a cool story line with a late 19th-century setting and Abraham Lincoln, and I had a good time that I did not expect!<br/><br/>If you take your movies seriously, I would stay home, as you might feel intellectually cheated out of your hard-earned money. I thought it was intelligent, but I am the guy that hates 3D movies, over-the-top special effects, slow-mo fight scenes, vampires, zombies, and story lines done over-and-over-and-over again - all for recycling, but not of movie plots! And maybe this movie did have a recycled storyline...I have no clue!<br/><br/>For me, without knowing what the movie was about other than the title, I was thoroughly surprised and had a good time. Laughed a lot, although it's not an outright comedy, but I do like history, and as I will say for the third time, I liked the story!<br/><br/>If you are on the middle-of-the-fence, wait until it comes to the ""cheap seats"" or DVD."
"billygoat1071","6","32","64","6 July 2012"," Different Ridiculous
","Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter sounds like a strange silly title. Some might find it stupid while some will find it peculiarly interesting. People would expect it as a ridiculously fun bloody action film starring one of America's greatest Presidents. Since it's directed by Timur Bekmambetov, one of the most insane action movie directors ever, it suppose to be enjoyably crazy throughout. The film is fun when Abe is killing vampires with his axe, but it gets really different to the biography moments. While everybody is expecting for some awesome ridiculousness, we instead get a lot of serious biography that would take a lot of time to get to the vampire killing. It's entertaining but it could have been a lot more fun.<br/><br/>With that kind of title, people would expect it as a campy horror action film with a different version of Abraham Lincoln that has a potential to be a movie icon. It sounds absurd, but that is acceptable to its title. Unfortunately, its absurdity is limited by the seriousness of the biographical parts. Both elements are strangely mismatch. Made this film a lot more awkward than you would thought. There is nothing wrong with having an accurate history to it. It just feels a lot different when you compare Lincoln's rise to Presidency to the whole vampire slaying sequences. It gets interesting when Henry Strugess distracts at Lincoln's personal life. Every time he appears, it makes you ready for some vampire action.<br/><br/>Thankfully, it has Timur Bekmambetov as the director. He's also a vampire movie expert by his Night Watch films. He can make his action scenes impossibly crazy that makes the whole experience a none stop entertainment. Too bad there isn't any glass for him to break in a ridiculously stylish way like he did in his other films. At least we still get to see something interesting, like Abe's axe spinning, throwing a vampire up to the sky, and turning that horse stampede chase into a large scale sequence. The rest is not quite inspired, but it still makes a pretty awesome action film. Like I wish it has more that. It's still entertaining for some reason. The WETA visuals look obvious. It fits well to the director's crazy vision.<br/><br/>It's hard to recommend Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter. It's not as ridiculous as the title. It connects to Lincoln's life in a serious way. They could have at least give a bit more campier and sillier tone to make this alternate version of Lincoln iconic. Even with an awesome director, energetic cast, and vampires that look scary and kill horrifyingly, it's still not a satisfying vampiric onslaught. It's not horrible or boring either. It just needs to be an endless crazy action movie."
"lindhorstb","7","4","5","3 January 2017"," Good Movie - Know what your going into
","This is a good movie as long as you know what you are going into. It is not meant to be a historical documentary. Some look at it and see the name ""Abraham Lincoln"" and expect the movie to contain more of an historical aspect to the flick; however, in reality, it is a movie regarding Vampires. So, if you like vampire movies, you will probably like this. I read the reviews from others and they complain about how the book is so much different, well it is different. But anyone that reads a book and then expects it to be exactly the same (Other than Harry Potter Enthusiasts) has basically gone off the deep end. The movie does contain somewhat of the same plot, but it is not exactly the same. I like a lot of what some would categorize as ""weird movies,"" and enjoy the occasional vampire movie as long as its not overly gory, which this isn't. Its a good movie, just know what you are going to see, not what some wish it could be."
"davidgleicher74","1","27","54","28 June 2012"," My First Time Walking Out of a Movie Theater
","This is by far the worst movie adaptation I've ever seen. The fact that I gave it one star is only because I was forced to. Seth Grahame-Smith's book is not a literary masterpiece by any standard, but from what it was trying to achieve it managed to successfully and made it enjoyable. The only thing similar with this movie and that book was its title and the vague idea that Abraham Lincoln was something other than just a president. There is no emotional connection with the audience, no attempt to try to tell the biography of his life, the historical context is all gone, and they even managed to screw up the romance of Abe with Mary. I went into this trying very hard to like this film but just couldn't suffer another second of this butchery of such a good novel. All in all if you want to see a vampire slasher you will definitely enjoy this film but if you are coming to it to see the novel be put on the big screen you will be greatly disappointed.

"barnabyrudge","2","18","34","2 July 2012"," Genuinely terrible summer blockbuster, done with neither humour nor finesse.
","It seems to be a current literary fad of the moment to take an old classic and reinvent it with a deliciously twisted element of modern horror. Recent bestsellers include Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, Sense and Sensibility and Sea Monsters and Android Karenina. Apparently no-one has yet thought of 'Robinson Gruesome' or 'Uncle Tom's Cabin in the Woods', but it's surely just a matter of time. Pride and Prejudice and Zombies is from the pen of Seth Grahame-Smith – his other notable mash-up of classic literature, history and horror fiction is the fabulously titled Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter. Word is that the book is pretty good but sadly the film version of it is a huge disappointment (that's HUGE with block capitals, just in case you're not getting the message). It opts for style over content; unfortunately the style is a horrible mish-mash of absurd CGI mayhem, dumb dialogue and plotting-by-numbers. It's almost as if Smith's technique for adapting the screenplay was to link a set of post-it notes together with bits of string, each one containing an idea for a spectacular set piece. What no-one seems to have told him is that set pieces are only truly exciting and enjoyable if you build them around a story and characters worth caring for. There's nothing of that sort here.<br/><br/>Young Abraham Lincoln watches his mother die from an illness which baffles the doctors called upon to save her. He keeps to himself the fact that he witnessed a local plantation owner named Jack Barts (Marton Csokas) attacking her in the night, apparently feasting on her blood. Years later, a grown up Abe (Benjamin Walker) decides to take vengeance by killing Barts. He shoots him late one night on the dockside, only to find that he simply gets up uninjured and transforms before his eyes into a demonic monster. Abe is rescued from certain death by the arrival of Henry Sturgess (Dominic Cooper), a charismatic stranger who seems to know more than he should about the strange goings-on in the neighbourhood. Sturgess tells Abe that the country is awash with vampires and teaches him how to fight against them. Armed with an axe and ready to get stuck into his new line of work, Abe moves to the town of Springfield, Illinois; where he soon slays his first vampire. It isn't long before his vampire hunting antics catch the attention of undead master Adam (Rufus Sewell), a millennia-old monster who runs a plantation in the Deep South and has an army of vampires at his beck and call.<br/><br/>Almost nothing about Timur Bekmambetov's film works. What kills it more than anything is the fact that the plot is handled with a misplaced sense of seriousness. Sometimes a movie cries out for a lightness of touch, a tongue-in-cheek approach if you like, and this one needs it more than most. However, instead of embracing the silliness of everything that's going on and using it to its advantage, the film is played in deadly earnest. The performances are terrible, but this is hardly surprising given some of the awful dialogue the actors are required to deliver. Visually the whole thing is rather ugly too, with a saturated tone which is presumably meant to evoke times gone by, but only succeeds in offending the eye.<br/><br/>Two stars then for the intriguing title and for presenting a fairly original concept, but in terms of final execution this movie is a train wreck of considerable magnitude. It looks likely that Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter will be remembered as the worst blockbuster of 2012's summer season."

","Saw this film tonight with extremely low expectation and just needing to get out of the house. So when I watched the beginning I thought this was going to be another failed horror flick full of clichés and dull plot or simply no plot. How wrong I was. When I began to get into it I realised that this was in fact more of an old school Ripping Yarn. This is what was done so well on a lot cheaper budget in the UK years ago. It adds a ton of humour to what is a (Sorry for he pun) dead genre. Vampire stories have long gone by their sell by date and this gives them a new life. I laughed through the whole film and not once did they try to play it for laughs. It helped bring me out of a dull fog from too much work. It entertained me, not once did it scare me. I don't think it ever meant to scare anyone. This is a piece of pure fun and should be seen only as that. Think Sean of the Dead and you've got the idea."

","I've read the book, which this movie is based on and enjoyed it very much. I think that this movie kept mostly true to the source material which isthe aging make-up wasn't terrible (when it wasn't post-production). The actor playing Lincoln had pretty convincing aged makeup from teenager to the time of his death. <br/><br/>My problem with this film was the over-use of CGI. If someone got hit or shot, the director would use the ""Matrix effect"" of slowing the person down as they do an outrageous head over heals flip. And not just then, even when a person would just get pushed or looked at funny, there goes the slo-mo reaction. In general, I think this movie could have been a whole lot better with a lot less CGI. Almost every scene has it. Lazy film-making leaves everything to post-production. If used more sparingly, this could have been a much better movie.<br/><br/>Spoilers: It's amusing to me how the female vampire looks so similar to Circe on Game of Thrones, down to the hairstyle. Also, how does Abe write in the same journal from his teens to his 50s? Only one is left with the vampire."

","When the movie began being advertised in theaters myself and my friends joked about it sounding ridiculous, my boyfriend and I decided we'd like to see it for the action sequences and creativity aspect of such an outlandish title. It was then that someone I worked with clued me in to the fact that this movie was based on a book which he found to be ""hilarious."" So, being the comedy, AND American History nerd that I am I purchased the book to see what all the hype was about. I read the book within a matter of days, as it was an excellent read and a prime example of historical fiction. I did not find the book to be ""hilarious"" beyond a few moments where a snicker or giggle is warranted, BUT While the events of the time period in the book were truthful and well researched the author did an outstanding job fitting in the supernatural and weaving together an enjoyable story, the movie falls short in an epic way.<br/><br/>The character names are all that the two stories have in common. Events do not unfold as they should and are not in the correct chronological order. Some characters are portrayed vastly different, some characters are completely made up, and some are left out completely. The movie almost completely leaves out the historical events surrounding the main plot, and in doing so leaves the story lacking a real point and focusing on ""How awesome can we make this Abe vs Vampire confrontation look??"" Absolutely ridiculous. Glad I borrowed the Blu-Ray from a friend instead of spending money on this myself. I'm headed off the read the book over again, hoping to wash the bad taste of the movie out of my mouth."

","I never really knew what I was getting into when I payed a ticket to see Abraham Lincoln as a vampire hunter. But now that I've seen it, I want to say that I was satisfied...but I really wasn't.<br/><br/>There are some very great sides to the movie and some very bad sides. <br/><br/>Some good things:<br/><br/>The acting was surprisingly decent! No performances really stood out, but none of them were bad either. I also enjoyed the camera-work. There were a lot of great sets that enhanced the movie and made it a lot more enjoyable! The movie is obviously set in the older times and the movie does a great job of making it feel that way. The fight scenes were also very well done.<br/><br/>The bad:<br/><br/>This movie was very VERY jumpy in scenes. One moment there could be ten minute scene in the white house to a ten SECOND scene in some dark alley. I felt like it had a lot to get through in order to finish the story on time and that sped up the plot. It almost ruined the movie because sometimes the pace got too fast I was confused and not really sure who was doing what or what event is occurring. Also, I know it's not trying to be realistic in any way, and I tried to suspend any thoughts of realism, but some things that happen in the fights and battles are so ridiculous it's almost laughable. In my theater, actually, there were some people laughing so loudly at the absurdity of what happens in the fights.<br/><br/>I should also mention I saw it in 2D, and I don't think 3D would have made me enjoy it much more, but I could tell there were a few scenes specifically designed for the 3D screens. <br/><br/>Overall, if you don't take it seriously and are just looking for a good time, this COULD be the movie for you. But if you're looking for the tiniest bit of realism, I wouldn't recommend it."
"tgooderson","3","24","51","23 June 2012"," Nice idea, poor execution
","In 1818 a young boy by the name of Abraham Lincoln (Benjamin Walker) witnesses his mother's murder and vows to get revenge on the man who took her life. In his late teens he finally plucks up the courage to enact his revenge but when he fires a pistol at the head of the assassin, the man simply gets back up and attacks the young Lincoln. The young man is saved by a strange man called Henry Sturgess (Dominic Cooper) who tells the future President about the existence of vampires and teaches him the art of killing them. Lincoln dedicates his life to the destruction of vampires but finds in later life that words and deeds outweigh the power of his axe and he eventually becomes a Lawyer and later President of the Union. During his Presidency the vampire rich South declares war on the North in the hope of creating a nation for vampires.<br/><br/>This film is a case of a title that is better than the movie. The idea behind it sounds great; that one of America's most beloved Presidents was also secretly a Vampire Hunter, but the execution doesn't live up to the premise. I've recently read books about the American Civil War and Lincoln's assassination so probably know more than the average Brit about the President and this period of America's history and there were nice details, incidents and characters taken from the period and Lincoln's life that were included to give a bit of authenticity to the story. The truth, with the added inclusion of vampires could have created a really good film but alas it is not.<br/><br/>The film's design is meant to be a sort of Gothic horror but it relies far too heavily on special effects and hardly anything in the film feels tangible. You get the feeling that about 80% of the film is shot on green screen which is a shame because there must be plenty of locations that could have been used. Another design problem is that it was obviously meant as a 3D film but I saw it in 2D because 3D is terrible. As a result things are constantly heading out of the screen at you which in 2D look pointless and this is a film which will probably find success on DVD, a mostly 2D format so why the film was designed in 3D I don't know. 'Atmospheric fluff' is a constant feature of the cinematography and this just gets in the way. Obviously in 3D it's meant to give the sense of depth (which according to various reviews it doesn't) but in 2D it was once again pointless and distracting. For some reason the 30 year old Benjamin Walker looks like an alien or like Benedict Cumberbatch after he's been hit by a spade to the face when he is playing the younger Lincoln but as the older Lincoln he at least appears human. Some of the effects look decent although aren't on a par with the likes of Prometheus etc. The vampires for instance although obviously CGI'd, look quite good but the scene on the train looks awful and cheap. The main problem with the film's design is the constant slow motion shots. Although the film is 105 minutes long, if it was played at full speed throughout it would probably be closer to 70.<br/><br/>To me the tone feels all wrong. With a title Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter you'd expect to see tongue firmly in cheek but instead it is played completely straight as a historical epic/action film. There is very little humour and it just feels amiss. This could have been a funny, gruesome film with a historical backbone but instead it's a boring, ridiculous film with a historical backbone. Dominic Cooper stands out on the acting front but his twist could be seen a mile off. Benjamin Walker is fine and does a fairly accurate impression of Lincoln but he suffers under what I presume are prosthetics.<br/><br/>Overall this is a mess of a film. The idea is interesting and it could have been great but the execution is extremely poor, from the fake looking blood to serious tone the whole film is a disaster.<br/><br/>www.attheback.blogspot.com"
"Al_The_Strange","7","10","18","25 June 2012"," ""Why, Mr Lincoln, you're full of surprises!""
","Chances are that you've already made up your mind about this film when you read its title. You'll either facepalm at the sacrilege of turning one of history's greatest men into something base and tasteless, or you'll laugh your behind off. Regardless of your reaction, the film may surprise you. Director Timur Bekmanbetov has proved himself to be a master of orchestrating scenes of absurdity and chaos, with beautiful and awe-inspiring action scenes, and with serious demeanor. He does the same here, orchestrating the absurdity with a straight face and plenty of style to satisfy.<br/><br/>After ""Wanted,"" a film so loaded with fantastic action sequences, I was hoping Bekmanbetov would deliver a plethora of inspiring new setpieces. Such scenes are few and far-between in ""AL:VH;"" there are plenty of short fights with lots of style and lots of gnarly bloody mayhem, all captured in flowing slow-motion photography. The biggest standouts will be the horse stampede scene, which somewhat resembles a crazy car-chase scene that swaps out the cars with horses and sends horses flying off in all directions (a very clever and inspiring scene, in my opinion, which is sadly marred by some camera shake and lots of dust on the screen), and the climactic train battle, which will likely be compared to the train scene in ""Wanted,"" but I feel it's a solid stand-alone setpiece. In terms of action, the film delivers; it's still the director's tamest and sanest work, but what we get would be something comparable to an ""Underworld"" movie.<br/><br/>The story for this madness is generally sound, believe it or not. Regardless of how you accept the idea that Abe slays the undead in his off-hours, the film does a fine job of weaving historical accounts and personal history in with the vampire storyline. I'm no Lincoln expert, so I don't really know how much of the film is accurate (I certainly don't know how well it adapts the original novel). Accepting it as its own little universe, I felt it was generally successful. Half of it does a good job of setting up the vampire story and the other half does a good job of playing out the period drama, all in an earnest manner.<br/><br/>If there is any problem with the story, it would be in its consistency; the opening scenes whiz by really fast, before settling into a steady and pleasing pace during Abe's youth. The story then zips through entire years of the story, lightly covering the Civil War aspect and speeding it up to the climax. It's very choppy, uneven pacing; I suspect that 30-60 more minutes of scenes would have allowed the story to breathe, allowing the pacing to flow naturally and make the film even more epic than it is. What we get feels like an abridged telling of the overall story.<br/><br/>The film definitely has style. The camera work can be a little shaky in some scenes, but there are also a lot of moments with slick slow-motion photography. There are quite a few unique editing effects. Acting is generally not bad; I grew to accept Benjamin Walker as the title character, for he looked and acted the part very well. Writing is not terribly strong, but it gets the job done. This production has decent-looking sets, props, and costumes. As one other reviewer pointed out, however, the makeup department failed to make certain characters age the way Lincoln does, and it can be distracting. Music for this movie has some really awesome parts.<br/><br/>There could have been more to the film: more crazy action, more to the Civil War scenes, more consistency to the plot, etc. Still, if you're looking for stylish vampire-slaying action like I am, the film generally satisfies. I probably wouldn't recommend this to anybody looking for perfect cinema, or anybody who can't accept the premise of the film's title. For everybody else, I'd recommend checking it out as a rental.<br/><br/>3.5/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Average | Film: Pretty Good)"

","Although some say that the plot and story line of this movie is very unrealistic and poorly thought about, i completely disagree. This movie has taken a well known piece of American history and added a fantasy twist. The directors have tried to give you the feel off an alternate world with alternate history, and any good fantasy film tends to do this. Yes there are a lot of CGI effects and action scenes, but it is the type of movie that benefited from that. I myself do not watch fantasy or period/history films, but this surprised me. Acting could be judged at times, but for an actor who has been in very few films their were times when Benjamin Walker showed real star quality. Definitely worth a watch and i will be purchasing this film on DVD as a guilty pleasure."

","Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is the new movie from director Timur Bekmambetov (Wanted, Night Watch) and Tim Burton, based upon the book by Seth Grahame-Smith, who also wrote the film's screenplay. What if Abe Lincoln was not just a President of the United States, but a vampire hunter, and that history was actually clouded by a series of lies? Bear witness to the truth behind one of America's greatest Presidents that changed the course of history and the fate of humanity.<br/><br/>The script was well-written, bearing resemblance to the novel in ways, but never a 100% adaptation. The actors/actresses were fantastic and great for the roles they were given. Benjamin Walker as Abraham Lincoln was fantastic; he was not only believable, but showed a certain determination and love for peace that no other actor could have shown in the role of this old President. Rufus Sewell was incredible as Adam, the main antagonist and leader of the vampires wanting to control America. Erin Wasson was just stunning as Vadoma, who never showed a single care in the world for anyone other than herself. The visual effects were not ""Avatar""-standards, but were still fantastic to the point where they worked; the one scene where visuals were phenomenal was the train sequence. The music by Henry Jackman worked great, as it blended in with the film itself, cued in for the right moments when needed.<br/><br/>Overall, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter was a fun, well-made film that could be considered an action masterpiece as it never let up on its impressive action or suspense. The downsides were that it should have been at least 20 minutes longer to fill in gaps and prolong the story, which went by WAY too fast, and the poor script"

","Leave it to a Russian to paint American history with such accuracy. This is not an historical drama, nor does it purport to be, but it bears more stinging truth then the whole of the History Channel.<br/><br/>The Southern Confederacy, desiring to hold on to the last vestiges of gentility lest they get their white hands dirty, declared itself free from the Union in order to retain the right to own people as if they were property. The parasitic white slave owners fed off of the blood of the workers like vampires. Bekmambetov simply takes this allusion to the next logical step. Abraham Lincoln, the Great Emancipator, did not merely take up arms against the act of slavery but against the very thought of it, the idea that it is somehow acceptable.<br/><br/>Abraham Lincoln, played by Benjamin Walker -- a young Gary Cooper who astoundingly triumphs in an iconic role that could have failed so easily -- learns quickly that his town of Springfield is rife with vampires: the pharmacist, the blacksmith... because you never know where your neighbours' loyalties lie. But where the metaphor that the southern states are best represented by the living damned is most outspoken is when the vampires take up the Confederate Gray and join the Civil War.<br/><br/>This not-so-subtle allusion will, no doubt, anger the staunchly southern states that fly the confederate flag with pride. But pride cometh before a fall, and Lincoln fells with one chop."

","A legitimately awful movie! The biggest waste of $11 ever. Wow. I can't even begin to express in words how absolutely horrible this film is. If there was a way for me to give this movie a 0/10, I would. <br/><br/>Firstly, let's talk about the plot. Abraham Lincoln, the president of the United States, killing an uprising of vampires. Really. Good fiction is when the concept within the piece of work is believable. BELIEVABLE. I would adore if someone could explain to me how this film is in any way fathomable beyond idiocy. I can't deny the existence of vampire lore in the Southern states in the 19th century, HOWEVER it peaked in the late 19th century, after the death of Lincoln. As far as I'm concerned, the people of the US thought the existence of vampires brought on tuberculosis, and that's where the myth ends. Thus, the absurd ""accuracy"" (I use that word sparingly) of this film is only barely hanging on. Please spare me the agony of speaking of this further. <br/><br/>Secondly, let's talk about the acting. With an already barely tolerable plot, the acting was not redeeming for this film. I was not expecting the most amazing performance I'd ever seen in my entire life, but it's almost as if they weren't even trying. It was horribly over-acted, further digging this show into the ground.<br/><br/>Thirdly, let's talk about the action. If you can get past the wretched plot, perhaps the action wasn't all that bad. I, however, could not. I found the action positively drab and random. Some of the scenes were drawn out so long that any of the initial fascination with the action was faded and lost by the end of it. If you're going to this or renting this for the action, do yourself a favour and get a Bruce Willis or Sly Stallone movie instead. <br/><br/>Let's all be honest here, this movie made it onto a few film lists, and is a serious contender against other movies for some great titles.

What was presented before me was Abraham Lincoln's life not only in Lifetime movie drama form but also a way, way over the top action flick. I literally could not stop laughing at how horribly corny and awful most of the scenes were. There was very little plot that wasn't already apparent if you have taken any American History class, which left the film stale, no plot twists or turns. Abraham is ""Honest Abe"" the entire movie though somehow becomes this ass-kicking ninja warrior overnight (the montage is hilarious). And the movie is way too long. It covers a huge span of time and by the time you are at the end; you just can't believe it's still going on. <br/><br/>I get green screen special effects are neat but this movie relied on it heavily, creating scene after scene that the movie literally had to keep outdoing itself. The action scenes that should have been memorable just weren't because there was way too much going on. Abraham also had very little emotion in his performance, they tried to make him heartfelt in his fight against slavery but it just felt way too forced as with the whole movie. He was in no real danger either; he was almost caught a few times but somehow just got lucky, too lucky to create a real suspenseful movie I think.<br/><br/>All in all, I can deal with the history inaccuracies and even the action, the seriousness this film tried to portray just made is god awful corny. I can't describe how agonizing it was to sit through scene after scene of this nightmare of a film. <br/><br/>I am horribly disappointed. If it had even a slight bit of humor or maybe dark comedy features, it would have made this a bearable movie. Even if Abe just had some one-liners, I think I wouldn't be so disappointed.<br/><br/>Please don't see this movie, unless you want ridiculous way-over-the-top action. I say go for it!

Not only is this good versus evil saga high on the testosterone drive, but it also succeeds in rendering the image of Abraham Lincoln in colorful mosaic. It transforms Mr. Lincoln from a President to a demigod. People do not remember the minute historical details; plain history is drab, monotonous, stifling and strait-laced. What they remember is the myth surrounding the man/event and that is why Mahabharata and Ramayana not only survive but thrive in India. They are mythological pieces of literature, open for all to interpret it in any way they want. To reduce it to facts, would take out the life-juice from it. Similarly movies such as 'Abraham Lincoln- the Vampire Hunter' succeed in keeping the legend on. To read him in factual history books or to watch him in tableaux, live and kicking- what would you prefer?<br/><br/>I, as always, would prefer the latter. Even if Mr. Lincoln was to be replaced by one of the Indian Prime Ministers, I would have watched it with equal, if not more, enthusiasm.<br/><br/>'Abraham Lincoln- the Vampire Hunter' succeeds (according to me) due to the excellent acting by Benjamin Walker. I really don't know much about the real life Mr. Lincoln (other than the fact that he was lovingly called Abe Lincoln), but I believe that Benjamin had indeed been able to imbibe the character perfectly and has done justice to Abraham Lincoln.<br/><br/>This movie indeed boasted of some excellent action sequences and especially those involving copious amount of blood spilling- it was quite graphic.<br/><br/>The 3-D effect was good, the setup- quite wonderful. And the movie itself was gripping and fast paced.<br/><br/>The dialogs were indeed inspired (also inspiring)!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Whether you watch it or not, is of course upto you.

"xThe_Fury","5","12","25","22 June 2012"," Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter - A Review by Brandon Krzysztof
","""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" is an action filled drama that  combines American history and the popular vampire theme that movie  goers have grown up with. With the several vampire movies that have  been released in recent years, this movie has to compete with the idea  that the audience may be tired of the genre. By adding the name Abraham  Lincoln to the movie, this film just may spark a new genre of combining  horror themes with American history.  Abraham Lincoln (Benjamin Walker) as a kid witnessed his mother being  killed by a vampire and now as young man before his life in politics,  he gets trained by Henry (Dominic Cooper) on how to hunt vampires. With  this knowledge, he plans to hunt down the vampire who killed his  mother. After calling it quits to pursue a career in politics, he hears  that vampires are helping the Confederacy in the war and comes up with  a plan to eliminate them and win the war.  The acting in the movie was decent and tolerable; that was one of the  few things I wasn't expecting. Benjamin Walker did a good job as young  and old Abe Lincoln. The film had a lot of violence and gore, but the  director's previous film (Wanted) had a lot too so I was expecting  that. The pace of the film was somewhat good. The balance between  dramatic scenes and action scenes is what kept the film going in the  first half. But beginning the second half was a 20 to 30 minute scene  of Abe as President with tons of dialogue and no action and it causes  the audience to lose attention; but the end sequence restores that with  a long action scene. The CGI and effects were over the top; it looked  like Timur Bekmambetov was using the action formula he used for Wanted  and it got really repetitive.  Personally, I enjoyed the film. The 3D was okay, not the worst I have  seen. The CGI is overused but it is tolerable. I like the concept of  mashing U.S. history with the vampire theme and I think the filmmakers  did that well. It's not a film that I'd recommend spending $13.50 on,  but it is not a bad rental. It can easily be enjoyed as a popcorn  flick.  2 1/2 out of 5."

","This film can proud itself by being one of the very few I left the theater just before the ending credits. I never expected much. I just wanted some nice hack 'n' slay stile ""Popcorn Kino"". But boy was I disappointed. There are so many flaws in the film. For example the very vital (pun intended) information that vampires react poorly to silver. The explanation is that old Judas and the silver tale. But why does it affect a vampire who is supposedly over 4000 years old? And were is the link from Judas to vampirism? If Judas was the first vampire (once again) that was agreeable but he isn't. A vampire can't kill another one? Therefore the fist of Lincoln's mentor is stopped some inches before he hits his own maker with the fist. Who vice versa is not hindered in any way later in the flick as he punishes his childe. Those are only the worst flaws which echo through my brain. There are more. They constantly knock on your synapses as you watch. Which you shouldn't. Trust me."
"cadillac20","6","11","23","22 June 2012"," An Entertaining, If Unremarkable, Period Vampire Slayer
","Although I knew Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter (from now shortened to Abe, Abraham or ALVH) was based on a novel, I've not read the novel. I have, however, heard good things. This is most likely not the novel the film was based on. A slick, action heavy vampire slayer movie that has more in common with Blade than Interview with a Vampire, like the novel, this re-imagines a history in which Abe Lincoln became a vengeance lusting, ax wielding vampire hunter, where vampires have a part in American History. The action is great, but sadly, everything else is mediocre. While the film presents some interesting ideas, the acting and plot are mostly ho-hum in favor of a rushed history lesson and speeding from one action piece to another.<br/><br/>Timur is an odd choice for this film, but probably one of the most inspired. He has a way of creating slick action, and it's no different here. From his creative uses of slow motion to the interesting action set pieces, in particular the final one on a train and an inventive one through a stampede of horses, Timur flaunts his skills at creating over the top action and reveling in it. And for sure, the action is the best part. With demonstrations of martial skills with an ax and cinematography that thankfully gives us a great view of the action, you're in for a more creative action packed film than the usual vampire hunting affair.<br/><br/>Sadly, beyond this, the majority of the film is mostly bogged down by historical details that are somewhat skimmed over and a plot that isn't all that interesting. Every character beyond Lincoln and his teacher, Henry, are mostly dull and cliché. Adam is the cliché, high class vampire villain with an air of superiority. Will is the token black guy, Abe's best friend since childhood and his eventual sidekick. Even the lovely Mary Winstead, who plays Mary Todd, is little more than eye candy (although, admittedly, she delivers one very solid, emotional scene that demonstrates her fantastic acting abilities). The script as well is as much to blame. There is a lot here that should be interesting, like the vampires involvement in the civil war. It's a fascinating idea, but it's rolled over in favor of watching Abe kick vampire butt.<br/><br/>Now there have been a lot of complaints about this film having no humor, and quite frankly, I am glad it didn't. Yes, several things seem funny, but the fact that this is a straight forward film that takes it's vampire involvement serious is a good thing. Had this been as comical as it's title suggests, it would have been a lot worse than it is. But as it stands, it is a slightly more than mediocre film with some great action scenes. It's nothing to write home about, and I probably won't be renting it to watch it again, but it was a decent and entertaining way to kill a couple hours on a warm summer day."

","When I first heard this title advertised, I had a VERY skeptical response. But as the film neared its premiere I began to get more and more curious. And once I found out that Tim Burton was producing, and I saw a few previews, I had to see it.<br/><br/>As expected, the special effects were great. The 3-D was particularly good. The story was exciting and kept my attention. I also thought the make-up effects were very good (Mary Todd didn't age well, but Lincoln was awesome). But I found my mind wandering so much, that I had trouble just enjoying the movie.<br/><br/>The problem I have is that I have always been critical of ""historical"" films. They are NEVER accurate, and it drives me crazy. Now, I know that this is not a historical film, but I found myself thinking through my knowledge, as limited as it is, of the history around the story--and I was being critical! I kept having to remind myself that this was FICTION!!! Well, this was my loss--I was unable to enjoy this movie, even with the exciting action and story. I think it may have been a better story with a less recognizable historical personality--but then the story wouldn't have been the same at all. Catch 22."
"UberGoober1411","7","7","13","25 June 2012"," Great choreography & breathtaking visuals, along with solid acting, cover a few plot holes in an otherwise fun film
","Unlike most people who wrote this movie off as soon as they saw the title, I was excited to see this film. Regardless of what the movie is called, whether it's Jesus the Pedophile or George Bush the Camel Tamer, if it looks good you can bet your ass I will go see it. Putting my ranting aside, this movie is based off of a book by Seth Grahame-Smith with the same name and having heard rave reviews about the work of literature I went into the movie expecting a good movie. I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is a movie based loosely off of the life of the 16th President of the United States. Right away this movie sets itself up as a fantastical movie with lots of action and gore, fully deserving the R rating (in the best way possible). Abraham Lincoln's mother gets killed by someone, who Lincoln later finds out is a vampire, and wanting to exact revenge he takes a midnight jaunt to this vampire's last known location and puts a bullet into his head. Little does he know that bullets, apart from silver ones, do not kill vampires and subsequently gets his ass kicked by this dead fiend. After a nice whooping, a nice gentleman saves him and after waking up in this aforementioned gentleman's house Lincoln pleads his case and the gentleman, who ends up being Lincoln's future friend Henry, teaches Lincoln the secrets to vampire hunting. Setting up a decree of guidelines that Lincoln has to follow, he proceeds to sends Lincoln a new target every now and again, hoping to thin the vampire lines and eventually wipe out the race entirely.<br/><br/>The fight scenes in this movie are extremely exciting and are fully worth the 3D surcharge. This movie has to have been filmed with a 5K resolution camera because the graphics are up to par with Ridley Scott's most recent piece of dung, Prometheus - and that's saying something. The choreography in said fight scenes is probably the brightest star that shines in this bijou's plentiful sky. All the actor's are completely enthralled in performing their respective roles and it shows because every motion from jump, to crouch, to a swing of Abe Lincoln's axe is beautifully detailed and fluid, without choppy motions or uneven transitions. The use of slow motion really adds to this effect and despite being used frequently does not become shopworn or banal.<br/><br/>I mentioned the visuals in the previous paragraph but they deserve another look-see (as weak of a pun as that is). The blood effects in this movie are detailed and disgusting but it makes it all the better; the simple graphical ends in this movie make it an all-around beauty to watch - the dirt that is kicked up during a chase scene with about 100 horses is detailed and visually entertaining; the battle scenes where the dead attack the living are visually pleasing and you can almost see the ageless wrinkles on the vampires' faces. All-in-all this movie should be considered in contention to receive the title of graphical powerhouse.<br/><br/>Amidst the great choreography and breathtaking visuals there lie a few miscues and maybe even plot holes. When Henry gets bitten by a vampire he turns into immediately while his wife, who also gets bitten, lies limp and dying in his arms. Soon after she dies - why? How come both female characters in the film who get bitten by the vampire, along with Lincoln's future son, die soon after their wounds are inflicted? And how can Speed commandeer a horse and carriage to go directly through a building's window/wall without any damage to the animals themselves? Given the ""castles in the air"" nature of the movie I can get over the latter quip of the two mentioned.<br/><br/>So, should you go spend some amount of money on this movie? Yes. Should you fork over the extra (approximate) $2.50 surcharge for 3D? Maybe. If you're a 3D buff, then yes. If you are rich, then why not? The 3D, unlike in some movies, compliments the plot and action scenes so therefore you hardly notice that you're wearing glasses 15 minutes into the film. Therefore, I would recommend seeing this movie in 3D, if you're not too frugal.<br/><br/>In the end, this movie proves it's worth to me and silences the naysayers and critics (and that one woman behind me, who after seeing the trailer for the movie thought that the director/screenplay writer were re-writing history). This is a very solid film with stellar acting performances from Benjamin Walker and Dominic Cooper. And to answer the question whether this film is worth a watch, I shall take a lyric from the band Rev Theory: ""Hell Yeah"".<br/><br/>+3 Graphics <br/><br/>+1 Choreography <br/><br/>+2 Benjamin Walker <br/><br/>+1 Dominic Cooper"

","Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter (2012) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4)<br/><br/>This horror/action film sets up to tell the true story of Abraham Lincoln (Benjamin Walker) who witnessed his mother getting killed by a vampire so he dedicates his life to stopping the bloodsucking creatures. ABRAHAM LINCOLN: VAMPIRE HUNTER might have a silly title but it's actually a fairly ambitious little movie that really took me by surprise. Going by the trailer you'd think that this film was just going to try and do a BUBBA HO TEP and takes a historical figure and make some cheap thrills out of him killing vampires. There's no doubt that the ""cheap thrill"" aspect is on full display here but the film actually goes a bit further by tying all of these events into common knowledge surrounding Lincoln's life. Not only do we get the vampire stuff but it's pretty well blended in with various historical truths like Lincoln becoming a lawyer, marrying Mary Todd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and we go all the way up to the Civil War. The final thirty-minutes actually take place during the Civil War and the way the writers used slavery and the vampires was pretty interesting. With that said, I really hope no one goes into this movie expecting historical accuracies (they'd be crazy right?). Walker actually does a very good job at playing Lincoln. I thought he was very believable playing the good soul as well as the action hero. Dominic Cooper was excellent as his mentor and Anthony Mackie is also very good in his role as a black man who aids Lincoln. Even Winstead is good in her part even though the screenplay doesn't do her character much justice. The one major issue I had with the film was the incredibly bad CGI effects. I thought there were some that was so bad that you'd expect to be seeing them in a SyFy movie. Just take a look at the scene where Lincoln in chopping the tree or a really embarrassing sequence dealing with horses. The slow motion action scenes also weren't all that entertaining. With that said, I really liked the way director Timur Bekmambetov built up the atmosphere of the 1800's. I was really surprised how how authentic everything was and I think this is a reason why the CGI looks even worse. ABRAHAM LINCOLN: VAMPIRE HUNTER should have been a really, really bad movie but I think for the most part they got it right and those with a little knowledge of the real history around the war should find the touches interesting."
"jeremyhwernli","5","8","16","9 July 2012"," Blade, Vampire D, Let the Right One...
","I have to say this movie is one of the strangest vampire films I have ever seen. Now in a way I can understand how some might see that as complimenting. But I don't think this vampire film is of note. It's not the best vampire film or the worst. What's so strange is obviously the Abraham Lincoln aspect.<br/><br/>When I say aspect, I mean aspect. The title being split Abraham Lincoln:Vampire hunter is not surprisingly fitting. On one hand this movie is about a vampire hunter. And on the other it's about Abraham Lincoln. In truth this is a movie about a vampire hunter. The writer of both the book and screenplay Seth Grahame-Smith seemingly thought making the hunter Lincoln, made things more interesting but had little interest in actually making it even a little bit convincing as a fantasy. That is to say the Lincoln aspect is completely a gimmick.<br/><br/>The fact this film has little to do with what we know of Lincoln is probably not surprising to anyone. But like I mentioned before simply as a vampire hunter film, this one isn't very good. The introduction to the film and Lincoln as a vampire hunter felt like a run through. It seems the writer and director knew they we covering over-used ground and instead of doing something different, they just speed things up.<br/><br/>Despite the pacing causing me to be withdrawn, I did find the director Timur Bekmambetov and the editor William Hoy created interesting transition techniques from shot to shot and scene to scene. The transitioning certainly made the overall film more effective, but it did not save the film. Another strength in the film was the cinematography. It had the expected nights basked moonlight, sunrises and sunsets that are essential in vampire films. But overall the look of the film was engaging and artful. I thought the overall custom design was pretty good as well.<br/><br/>The acting wasn't bad for the most part, Grahame-Smith didn't give them much of a chance to give a performances of note. I will say that visually Benjamin Walker pulled off being Abraham Lincoln. But does he pull of being Lincoln? I think he does as well as one can be expected to,considering.<br/><br/>This movie is of some worth. This is due in no small part to the production designer, art director, set decorator, custom designer, and cinematographer. I think Timur Bekmambetov, probably most known for directing Wanted, shouldn't be written off either. Bekmambetov's two vampire movies Day Watch and Night Watch has gotten him a lot of attention as well(I haven't seen them but they are well regarded by many creditable vampire film aficionados). To be honest I think the one who should be spotlighted for this movie being an ineffective vampire film is the writer Seth. He is new to the screenplay writing game and it shows. Not to say he is talentless. I think this project was a bit to ambitious and it was too easy to go wrong. I won't go into the narrative faults but there are plenty of holes and one key thing we learn about the vampires is thrown out the door in the climax. Maybe if this film had dropped the gimmick, which is what the Abraham Lincoln aspect is, and made a movie about a vampire hunter during the same time, we could of had a far more interesting film on our hands.<br/><br/>Oh yes, in the summary/header I put three alternatives for those looking for good vampire films. I listed Blade and Vampire D because those are good vampire hunter films as is John Carpenter's Vampires and their are others. I put Let the Right One In because that is a newer Swedish vampire film that is truly worth watching. The American version Let Me In isn't bad either. But if you have been searching for good vampire films you probably have already seen the ones I listed. But not to worry Let the Right One In proved the foundation made by the original film Nosferatu is to strong to be destroyed by this vampire fad lead by the Twilight Saga."

Sadly the film really doesn't come close to living up to it's potential. This is probably the poorest editing I have seen in a feature film in quite some time. I was really looking forward to the action sequences, but all you got was a lot of grey mist and blurring.<br/><br/>The script was really dopey, too. I'm not a huge fan of the stuff they added for the sake of action sequences to the story, because it was all REALLY dumb. I also don't much care for the ending they opted for here. The ending of the book had a whole lot more going for it. I loved the theme of ""Some men are just too interesting to die.""<br/><br/>One giant surprise, though, was the performance from Benjamin Walker. This guy really knocks this role out of the ballpark. He has the acting chops to be a major star. It's too bad it was wasted on this poorly edited mess!"

","I created an account just to review this horrible movie, so maybe I could save some people from wasting the almost 2 hours it took to endure this wreck. I have read the book prior to seeing this, and literally 5 minutes in I was already appalled by the changes and regretting the money wasted on the tickets. The book is beautifully written, one that makes a hundred pages fly by, and even after your eyes hurt from the strain, you still want to go back for more. I was really looking forward to seeing how they would transform some of the powerful scene in the book to the silver screen. But unfortunately, not a single scene made it from the book to the projector. Only a few characters were kept from the book, and were only represented in name, none of their actions or their personalities made it through the Hollywood-ization. At one point Abe grows from a 30ish year old to a 50 year old in two minutes flat. As if there was no growth for him as a man, no substantial plot or character building happened during those years just *poof*: shopkeep to president, just like that. It just has to be the worst book to movie adaption ever made."

","I watched this movie because I found the idea of mixing genres very intriguing (historic drama plus vampire fantasy). However, what annoyed me most is the look of the movie, it's in sepia... terrible! Also, it does not really mix genres. It's mostly an action movie. So do action movie goers get one's money's worth? I personally don't think so, because the action scenes are very exaggerated and unrealistic. In most of the fight scenes Abraham Lincoln behaves as if he was a super hero. I just don't buy it! Benjamin Walker didn't convince me in his role at all, but maybe he was just one victim of the bad script and cinematography. My advice: don't be a victim yourself! Don't watch this movie unless you are really desperate!"

The book ending was really quite good, the movie end was stupid. I was given Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter the novel on CD by a friend. It was surprisingly good for a novel about an ax wielding president killing vampires in his spare time. The thing that made the novel so good was how careful Seth Graham Smith was to keep everything historically accurate. People dates places were very accurate in the book with some liberties of course. This movie, however did not even try to link the story line to any real history. The characters in this film felt very wooden and over played;Kind of like one of those lawn silhouettes painted fluorescent orange,not a pretty sight. The key events in this movie are rearranged from the book to make way for big holly wood stunts that seem very unnecessary and make little sense to history, or the original story.

But I was hopeful that it would at least contain some of the best scenes from the novel. It did not. In fact, outside of the title & a few of the characters, this is not the same story at all.<br/><br/>Even if you were to ignore the fact that this was such a poor adaptation, I'm not sure how so many people have given this movie a positive review. Add the many clichés to the sometimes very poor acting & the very rushed pace of the story, & you get a movie that's FAR from worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>It's such a shame, really.

","When I sat down to watch Abe Vampire Hunter I wasn't expecting much. This may have been the reason I was pleasantly surprised by it. The story of Abraham Lincoln being a vampire hunter seems like an idea that would be so hard to pitch that it would have never have gotten off the ground in the first place. Indeed 20 years ago it would not have. With so many movies being remakes and reboots it's nice to see that the studios do look at new concepts and are willing to take chances. Abraham's story does indeed have flaws. There are times that i was watching it jump from scene to scene like a storyboard concept with all the subtlety of a montage. The characters are fully fledged comic book characters that all have a story to tell but not much heart to go with them. But this was never meant to be a heart warming story of a man and his dog. It's a high concept action/horror film using a historical figure as it's main focus. I do feel that the tongue in cheek title does deceive a little bit as I was hoping for a bit more humour, it's title alone is a eye roller that asks you to just go with it. But sometimes the film actually takes itself too seriously a bit. But once you get over the fact this is an action/horror, you are left with a great piece of Saturday night entertainment. The ideas on show here are very refreshing to see and some of the action sequences are visually stunning. The 3D is also very enjoyable, with the slow motion really giving the pop out effect another little extra treat for you. (Apologies to the 3D haters but I happen to enjoy films that jump out and occasional moments that break the 4th wall). I found myself looking at the scenery and camera angles as they showed off the set designs and props fantastically. It is a piece of eye candy and its very pleasant on the eye.<br/><br/>Possible Spoiler Alert: One scene I found incredibly refreshing was the galloping horses action sequence. Original, brutal and something that makes the film stand out from all the usual hum drum action fare out there. Abe's axe wielding is also another little piece of genius.<br/><br/>It's fair to say that this film is style over substance but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Sometimes I want to see great sets, brilliant SFX and intricate action sequences.<br/><br/>Will this movie save your love of cinema? Maybe not but it will keep the bed warm until a film that does comes along.<br/><br/>Abe Lincoln is a great piece of action cinema that will keep you entertained for 2 hours. Give it a go, Timur's vision has to be applauded even if the script is lacking a little X factor.<br/><br/>6 out of 10. Better than average."

","Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is about Abe's past adventures as a vampire hunter. After he becomes president and the civil war has begun, his past starts haunting him which forces him to become what he once was, a true slayer of vampires!<br/><br/>I was a bit skeptical about this movie, mainly due to how Chris Stuckmann (the movie reviewer that I follow the most) criticized it for being too serious. I don't like movies that are dumb because they take themselves too seriously. Like the Dark Knight trilogy (not that they are necessarily bad, they're just dumb). But once I actually got to see the movie, I was pleasantly surprised. This movie is great!<br/><br/>The problem Mr. Stuckmann had with the movie was that he thought it was way too serious for its concept. And to that I say, this movie is supposed to be unintentionally funny (if that makes any sense). The actual movie is incredibly serious, but the concept is so silly that you can't possibly take it seriously. That's why this movie is so great!<br/><br/>Another thing that I LOVED about this movie was the action! The action scenes are filled with epic slow-motion sequences and incredible choreography! And that one part where Abe turns his axe into a shotgun...! That was freaking unbelievable!<br/><br/>The movie also has some great characters. I liked the friends Abe met in his past, that would help him in the civil war later.

","OK. First, lets get this out of the way cause I don't want to hear it... YES, its a ridiculous premise. I know that, you know that, the world knows that, and the people who made the movie know that. Now that thats out of the way, it actually was very entertaining. Only huge problem, and I almost want to say I even docked it a star for it, was... it took FOREVER to get started. Seriously, you expect movies to start out slow in the beginning, but for some reason this movie moved at like, twice the slowness of a normal movie, and that did get very irritating. There was also a rather large jolt in the timeline I felt could've easily been avoided, but still, it was pretty solid story and action once you got through the beginning. The actor who played Lincoln, whose name I sadly don't know, actually turned in a solid performance. And, as with EVERY movie I see him in, Dominic Cooper once again redefined the fact that he's much more than just a solid actor. I do have some minor quibbles with the story, such as Alan Tudyk's character being completely pointless, (but I LOVE Tudyk so that was like a win lose for me) but it was pretty solid entertainment. Hope to see more, hopefully a little better done stuff from this director."

The film was directed and co-produced by Timur Bekmambetov, along with one of my favourite film makers Tim Burton. Like in the movie poster, the real life figure of Lincoln is seen to identify him as a vampire hunter.<br/><br/>Anthony Mackie was the high note in the movie, as he played Abe's long time friend Will, who later joined in the hunt of the un-dead.<br/><br/>The plot is a little loose, as it portrays vampires as one of the pioneers of slave trade. In Lincoln's attempt to stop their reign and expansion, the American civil war broke out. With men going after vampires that can only be killed by silver, it was a massacre, till Abe stepped up to the task; willing the axe all over the place, with his life almost cut short a couple of times, he managed to wipe them out.<br/><br/>The script is everywhere, the tale is a little shallow, and something's didn't add up. But maybe it was me, but I expected better cinematography, wasn't so thrilled by some camera angles. Tim Burton's presence can be felt in the directing style and the actors kinda grew into their roles.<br/><br/>Unlike the mock buster Abraham Lincoln vsZombies, this movie had Abe start with no beards, just a young man out for revenge. After he got into politics the beards showed.<br/><br/>Also the movie didn't have wise cracks like the mock buster. Anthony did well here compared to the mockery acting displayed in the movie, Man On The Ledge. Benjamin Walker is a new face to me, but I guess he will now be known as the man who played Abraham Lincoln.<br/><br/>Go see it, it was OK."
"gregeichelberger","5","7","15","20 June 2012"," A not-so-honest re-vision of Honest Abe
","Well, there is certainly no equivocation here. The title pretty much says it all. I mean, when a person goes to see ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,"" they're basically going to get Abraham Lincoln, vampires and, well, hunting. No beating around the bush.<br/><br/>Whether that bush is WORTH beating around, well, that's really up to the individual. It is interesting to note, however, that the same people who completely embraced the even more ridiculous revisionist fantasy, ""Inglorious Basterds,"" would criticize this film for employing the same technique.<br/><br/>As for me, I can read the title, have half a brain and certainly did not expect Shakespeare, so the experience was mostly satisfying. Keeping most of the Seth Grahame-Smith novel as faithful as possible (mainly because Smith was also the screenwriter), director Timur Bekmambetov (""Wanted"") has crafted a dark, violent re-telling of our beloved 16th president as sort of an ""Abe Lincoln In Illinois"" meets ""Blade"" meets ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."" I've heard of revisionist history, but this is ridiculous. <br/><br/>As explained previously, Lincoln (Benjamin Walker, a cross between the real Lincoln and Liam Neesom, ""Flags of Our Fathers"") not only encounters his real life historical foes in slave masters, Stephen Douglas and - eventually - the Confederate States of America - but, in this film, the vampiric undead who were responsible for killing his mother, Nancy Hanks Lincoln (Robin McLeavy in her American debut).<br/><br/>Seeing this act, the boy is intent on revenge, but is persuaded by vampire-hunter Henry Sturgess (Dominic Cooper, ""My Week With Marilyn""), to be patient and go through a classic film montage.<br/><br/>Henry also assigns the ax-wielding Abe to eliminate several lower-level Nosferatu, but not the one, Jack Barts (Marton Csokas, ""Alice In Wonderland"") who did in his mum. Later, Lincoln confronts Barts in a wicked horse stampede fight, but finds out a horrible secret about Henry.<br/><br/>He also meets Stephen Douglas (Alan Tudyk, ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon""), as well as his future wife, Mary Todd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead, the re-make of ""The Thing""). Those with ANY knowledge of Mary Todd will certainly attest that casting Winstead in this role was as ludicrous as having Bruce McGill playing Calvin Coolidge in ""For Greater Glory."" More bloody battles ensue, as Abraham has now met Adam (Rufus Sewell, ""The Tourist""), the leader of a legion of the undead, feeding mostly on slaves in the antebellum South. <br/><br/>For reasons explained in the movie, Henry and Adam have an unnatural hatred for one another, although neither can do the other harm.<br/><br/>Years seem to go by and now Lincoln is in the White House, the rebels bombard Fort Sumpter and the Civil War is on. Meanwhile, another creature, Vadoma (""Erin Wasson, ""Somewhere"") seeks to harm young Willie Lincoln right under Abraham's prominent nose.<br/><br/>With the vampires signing a pact with CSA leader Jefferson Davis (John Rothman, the remake of ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"") and the besieged Union troops at Gettysburg unable to stop them, it could spell the end of the nation as we know it.<br/><br/>Lincoln, though, comes up with a plan to save the day (and the country), but unlike Honest Abe taking on ghosts, ghouls and vampires, this subplot is patently ludicrous. Day one of the Battle of Gettysburg is over when the president comes up with a scheme just crazy enough to work.<br/><br/>It involves melting billions of metal items down, turning them into weapons, and delivering to Pennsylvania in time to stop the rebel advance — all in one day.<br/><br/>I'll believe almost ANYTHING in this crazy picture, but that's going TOO far.<br/><br/>Aided by his lifelong friend, slave but now-freedman, the completely unnecessary Will Johnson (Anthony Mackie, ""We Are Marshall""), as well as a few others, Lincoln tries to brush their venomous foes off the map.<br/><br/>But are they up to the task? Are they able to wipe out an army that is already dead (although for guys who cannot die, they are really, really easy to kill — even by those who had no training whatsoever)? <br/><br/>There is plenty of mind-numbing action and stomach-churning violence, but Bekmambetov does a nice job keeping up a quick pace; while the special effects are quite well done and the set design, art decoration, period detail and costumes are spot-on.<br/><br/>History becomes hysterical at times, but the overall effect works and the film seems not to take itself very seriously (accept maybe in its technical aspects). Don't throw away money on the 3D version, though, because that technology doesn't enhance the viewing pleasure one iota."

","I only went to this gastrointestinal challenge of a movie so I could comment.<br/><br/>Having watched Avatar, Prometheus and now this stinking pile of dross my concerns about western society, let alone movie making, are becoming serious.<br/><br/>I am a New Zealander who spent a lot of time in the USA and has done the rounds of Bull Run, Antietam, Gettysburg etc, and has a profound interest in the Civil War and its origins and outcomes. This is history, and maybe apart from an error of judgment or two at Gettysburg, the South may have carried the day, but they did not. Lincoln seized the moment to realign Union strategy with his famous speech.The rest is history.<br/><br/>What is this retarded nonsense about him being a vampire hunter? The vampire genre has been cooked to a cinder. There is only one vampire flick worth looking at, Dracula (?1993) with Gary Oldman, Anthony Hopkins, Keannu Reeves and Winnona Ryder, and even that is flawed but is close to the original Bram Stoker novel.<br/><br/>This movie is just putrid rubbish. If people want to watch such mindless escapism then let them do a pure work of ridiculous fiction like Austin Powers: Vampire Killer or Waynes Vampire World. Are we going to have Barack Obama: Secret Zombie, next? Goodness gracious.<br/><br/>And I won't go on about how Peter Jackson and NZ made Lord of the Rings, but hopefully we will through the Hobbit bring back true movie making to Wellywood.<br/><br/>As a postcript, I learned today from a cousin in Virginia some interesting information. He tells me 17 Turnbull's served with the CSA but another one (Major Thomas Turnbull) was in charge of the lead battery in the Union line that faced Picketts Charge at Gettysburg. His battery killed one cousin on the CSA side. I am told that this is the only known incident at Gettysburg of family killing family. He was forever outcast from the rest of the family. Makes me even more wild about this insult of a movie."
"MarcusJ13","7","5","10","9 July 2012"," It comes and goes
","Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is a film that appears to either be just a title joke or a joke trailer. It is difficult to envisage a film really coming out of this. The film does bring an origin to the Vampire hunting and doesn't attempt to dump the viewer straight into the action. However the film's run time means it struggles and makes it very sloppy. We get an origin but it is again a very sloppy one. It's nothing that you didn't see coming and fails to blow you away at any point. The film simply doesn't offer anything refreshing but it is fairly enjoyable bringing plenty of action throughout. The action starts out very well but then descends into what many action films become. A particular action scene involving a stampede of horses feels like it has no weight to it. It would look spectacular in an animated film but the CGI hasn't progressed enough where a large group of animals can look realistic in an action film. It looked like a flurry of images. The film does succeed in being engaging with the final action scene making up for any loss of weight in the previous action sequences. Acting wise it is just satisfactory where the performances are decent enough. I never really quite feel the pain that Lincoln is going through surrounding his mourning but its probably because we have this sort of thing many times before. Overall the film is a decent action yarn but does not really bring anything new but does entertain for the most part."
"cyifly-2","8","5","10","30 June 2012"," Make sure you see this one in the theater.
","I'll start off by saying that this film was quite good, if you like horror films. If you don't like horror films or vampire stories, don't go see it and don't review it. It would be the same as seeing a children's movie knowing you don't like children's movies. Stick to what you know. I like vampire/horror movies. So I'm going to review it.<br/><br/>I'm going to start by making one exception to the rest of my good review without giving too much away, of what I did NOT like about the movie: There is one scene, in the middle of the film, which was completely ridiculous. It was stupid and unnecessary and almost ruined the whole movie. It was meant to be a serious part of the film, and everybody was laughing out loud at how bad this small portion of the film was. It involves Abraham running and leaping from one fully-galloping horse to another, then a vampire throwing (literally) an 800-pound horse and hitting Lincoln with it. Not only can Lincoln act like a super hero for this one scene, but he can get up and dust himself off after being HIT WITH A HORSE like just tripped over his own feet. This was stupid and very overlooked by the director. He's not a super hero, nor a vampire, so it looked very out of place for the 'ordinary man' that he was trying to portray. It almost ruined the film. Almost. If you can overlook this one flaw, you have a good, entertaining film.<br/><br/>With that out of the way -- The rest of the movie was great. It was well told, well acted and the special effects were fantastic. The 'Real D' 3D was awesome. They didn't throw a lot of things at you, but the depth of the picture was great. The action seemed to never stop. It was well worth the price of admission. It's not going to win any Oscars, but it certainly is a great way to entertain yourself for a few hours, as long as you don't take any of it too seriously.<br/><br/>Most of all -- I applaud it for it's originality. The whole concept is very original as far as horror stories go.<br/><br/>Bottom Line -- Go see it in the theater. Throw your expectation out, and just go with it and you'll have fun."
"will51224","8","5","10","27 June 2012"," A fiercely entertaining ride
","When I first heard about this movie, the idea immediately intrigued me. I thought to myself: I like vampires. I like Abraham Lincoln. It's a win-win. I realize that the concept is a little too unconventional for some moviegoers, but it should be given credit at least for being original, which is rare in Hollywood nowadays. People constantly complain that all the current releases are either remakes or sequels, and when something original finally comes around they pan it and mock its concept. The vast majority of these dimwits haven't even read anything about the movie, let alone seen it, before they start jumping to conclusions. The idea of a mashup of genres is brilliant, and the filmmakers succeeded in blending historical and horror nicely. <br/><br/>The plot revolves around a nine-year-old Abe Lincoln witnessing his mother being killed by a vampire, which leads him to seek revenge as a young man. In the process, he meets Henry Sturges, who trains him to become a vampire hunter, and Lincoln begins slaying the vampires that Henry directs him to. Many years later, after he becomes president, Lincoln picks up his silver-coated ax again, making it his mission to defeat the vampires as they side with the Confederacy. <br/><br/>I've read that some fans of the book it's based on were disappointed in the movie because it differed so much from the book, despite the fact that the screenplay was written by the novel's author, Seth Grahame-Smith. As is the case for most film adaptations of books, some things had to be changed in order to fit the structure of a film, and to appeal to a mainstream audience. Although I haven't read the novel yet, I understand that it reads like a biography of Lincoln's life, and the vampire aspect is incorporated into that. The film would've been too long and most likely a little too dark if it had followed too closely to the novel.<br/><br/>The main problem I had with the film was the lack of transition throughout. For example, it seemed like Lincoln was a young lad slaughtering vampires, and before I knew it, he was living in the White House with his signature beard. Very little time was spent at all showing him campaigning. Also, for about a 15-minute period nothing exciting happens during his first few years as president, so that part seemed to drag slightly. However, the action-packed third act made up for it.<br/><br/>The film features one of the best transformations into a character I have ever seen. Benjamin Walker embodied Lincoln. Unfortunately, it seemed like the makeup crew spent so much time making Walker look like Lincoln that they forgot to age the rest of the characters convincingly. Aside from a few gray hairs, Mary Todd and Lincoln's friend Will Johnson hardly look different at all. If I didn't know any better, I would've thought that they were supposed to be vampires themselves.<br/><br/>I saw it first in 2D, and then I went again to see it in 3D. I can count on one hand the number of films I've seen more than once in theaters, so that tells you how much I enjoyed it the first time. I must say that I wasn't too impressed with the 3D. There were a couple of moments that made me jump where the 3D added a little something to the effects, but overall it didn't really make me enjoy the movie any more. The vampires were fierce and scary enough in 2D, so the 3D wasn't really necessary. Speaking of which, it's good to know some filmmakers are still capable of creating the real, old-school vampires instead of that Twilight trash.<br/><br/>It's a shame this movie didn't make more money than it did, considering it's cleverer and more entertaining than 90 percent of the crap Hollywood has been dishing out lately. The film knows its concept is ludicrous, and it presents itself with a serious face because it simply would not work as a comedy. The humor is subtle, as it should be. Anyone who was deeply disappointed with it was clearly expecting it to be something it's not. <br/><br/>Bottom line: I paid to see Abraham Lincoln kick some vampire ass, and that's exactly what I got."
"Roadwarrior85846","7","5","10","26 June 2012"," A great book to read. A great movie to watch!
","Ten years ago, an author name Joe R. Lansdale, wrote a short story that made the majority of readers appalled and scratched their heads about it's rubbish. The King of Rock 'n' Roll, Elvis Presley, fighting an ancient, demonic mummy in a nursing home. Later on, director of the Phantasm series, Don Coscarelli, made this bizarre story come to life and the movie made a cult following afterwards. The name of that movie was Bubba Ho-Tep. Think about it. If someone can make a story about an actual historic icon that we all know of, secretly facing off an evil fictional force, the sky's the limit.<br/><br/>This is when Seth Grahame-Smith comes in. Instead of a icon like Elvis, he uses the most American historic figure that changed and made our country's history. The sixteenth President of the United States, Abraham Lincoln. Smith made a risky step to use Mr. Lincoln as a axe-wielding warrior slaying vampires! Vampires? YES! VAMPIRES! How crazy does that sound?<br/><br/>At first, I had my doubts by looking at the cover of Mr. Lincoln smirking at me with both hands behind his back, holding a blood-splattered axe in one hand and a severed vampire head in the other. Over the months, I've decided to give the book at chance because you know what they say, ""Never judge a book by it's cover."" What a marvelous read it was, from beginning to end! How Abe discovered vampires are real when he was young, how he befriends the mysterious Henry, and his primary mission to kill many vampires as he can, intertwining with actual historic events with Smith's never-ending imagination of Mr. Lincoln's feud with the undead beasts! Very exciting read and highly recommend it!<br/><br/>I bet you are saying at this point, ""Hey! Wait asecond! You're supposed to be reviewing the movie, not the book. If you want to review the movie, go type away at barnesandnoble.com or amazon.com, buddy!"" In fact, you are right. I had been carried away blabbering about the book. As for the movie, It was equally exciting as the novel! <br/><br/>There were a lot of doubts about the cast selection for the film before it's release. But in my opinion, Benjamin Walker portrayed Mr. Lincoln pretty darn well. Even the late scenes when Lincoln aged into his 50's, Walker was still in solid form. As for the rest of the cast members, very great performances all-around! <br/><br/>The story plot is almost the same as a book, but a lot of the story itself has changed drastically, just to make it an action-horror film rather than a movie with a lot of dialog. However, Seth Grahame-Smith wrote the screenplay for the film, making it feel that you're still in a safe zone if you've read the book before first. Sure, the story went off a slight different direction, but still keeping it's original touch of the core, thanks to Mr. Smith's clever writing.<br/><br/>The fight scenes were very epic and fascinating to watch! Yes, I disagree about things getting CGI'ed beyond it's limit, but how else can two actors fight during a stampede of horses or a handful of actors on a runaway train on a burning bridge? I do have to admit that I felt quite cheated on the scenes when vampires show their true form by CGI'ing up the whole face rather than protruding their fangs like True Blood. But overall, do I really care about it? Not really. I was getting too interested by the combat and the choreography of each intense scene.<br/><br/>In conclusion, If you are a fan of the book, like I am, you will enjoy the film, like I did. Be prepared for big changes of the story, but other than that, you won't be disappointed. If you never read the book but curious about the movie, give it a shot. It's full of frights, action, blood and gore, wound up in an interesting, yet amazing, storyline. I suggest reading the book first, but you can read it after watching the movie if you're craving for more adventure out of it's plot. 9/10"
"roddmatsui","10","5","10","26 June 2012"," A modern classic fantasy/horror/adventure.
","I went in to see this knowing nothing about it, and was prepared to see another ""misfire""--the typical thing one sees nowadays--a good idea only half explored or half executed. Most films I see fall very short of what I consider good and that's what I expected here.<br/><br/>Imagine my absolute surprise when I found that ""Abe Lincoln"" is 1. a nicely executed period film with great sets and costumes, 2. a wildly paced action special effects feast, 3. an effectively witty self-satirical historical rewrite and 4. a gruesomely graphic horror flick! This is basically a ""10"" film with a few flaws. And nowadays, that ain't bad.<br/><br/>The humor here is quite subtle, most of the time. This film presents what is essentially a very tall tale, suggesting to the viewer that one of America's greatest Presidents was actually also a fearsome, axe-swinging, monster-slaughtering badass. The story of how all this came to be is lovingly presented as the most serious thing in the world, despite its patent ridiculousness. <br/><br/>The Civil War-era story links the intended secession of the Southern states with the rise to power of vampires in those states; so vampirism becomes a metaphor for slavery and man's general inhumanity to himself. In the wrapup, evil is merely driven away temporarily, and continues to be stalked by the avenging hunters; what current human evil is today the ally of the vampires?<br/><br/>In the midst of what is basically an impossible and absurd story are real human emotions and a strong backbone of morality. The result is simultaneously silly and profoundly moving. <br/><br/>In terms of story craftsmanship, this is an impressive piece. It's an old-school ""birth of the hero"" story that recalls the tone of earlier Hollywood epics and historical biopics, but in this case, it also serves up gaggles of vicious monsters.<br/><br/>This is a film so strange that many scratch their heads, but I think it will come to be regarded as a classic of genre cinema.<br/><br/>Many laughs, scares, and thrilling moments. Yeah. I loved it."
"blandiefam","8","5","10","26 June 2012"," Better Than the Trailers
","I must say that this movie was not what I expected. It delivered more than what anyone in the theater thought it would. I was surprised that some folks walked out in the middle of it. This drama with vampires was interestingly contrived between truth and fiction. The story of the vamps was creatively interwoven with the events of Lincoln's brief life. I loved the way the story stressed other important parts of his tenure as our 16th president and the inclusion of real named figures and fictitious ones made you feel as if the vampires were an unwritten part of our country's unique history. The actor playing Lincoln even resembled him and Liam Neeson. The acting was great and the story telling pulled you into a place where you felt as if his life could really have been this spectacular. The special effects were up there with other bigger advertised movies and the fight scenes reminded me of Sin City and Sherlock Holmes. I think this movie is worth watching only if you don't expect a teenager vampire romantic Gothic romp. I am guessing the ones who left expected more sex and something more in the line of recent romanticized vamp movies."

","A name and idea so bizarre that actually works? I thought that would be unreal but this movie proved that wrong. Never before have I seen such a creative idea be attached to a huge part of American History and actually make sense. While I did have high anticipation for this film, I was still very surprise and impressed by the outcome.<br/><br/>This film stars Benjamin Walker (Flags of Our Fathers, Kinsey), Dominic Cooper (Captain America: The First Avenger, The Devil's Double), Anthony Mackie (The Hurt Locker, Real Steel), and Mary Elizabeth Winstead (Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, The Thing).<br/><br/>The story starts you with a young Abraham Lincoln (Benjamin Walker) dealing with the death of his mother due to a Vampire. A few years later after his father passes away, he decides to go after the Vampire that killed his mother. While doing this he runs into Henry Sturgess (Dominic Cooper), a real vampire hunter who recruits Abraham Lincoln and trains him to become a real vampire hunter as well. From then on you see young Abraham Lincoln grow as a person with him becoming a great vampire hunter, a politician, and a love life. This is as far as I want to go with the story but from there Abraham Lincoln deal with becoming the 16th President of the United States, deal with the Civil War, and hunt vampires.<br/><br/>The 3D was actually pretty good at some of the heavy action scenes which was awesome, but for the slower parts of the film is was just added depth. I recommend seeing it in 3D for some of the really fun action scenes, but if you are not into the whole 3D craze, then the standard 2D should be just as good.<br/><br/>I really did enjoy this movie for how realistic they made the story seemed. They tied in this fictional story of vampires with the real life story of Abraham Lincoln so well that it seems like this movie could have been real. Another to note is how good the action looked. The were so many decapitated heads as well as hard hitting chops and slices into the vampires. Every hit that was delivered will make you cringe and believe they were real. The movie is something that you should go into with an open mind and you would think that you wouldn't take a movie like this seriously, but the movie is so dead serious with everything that happens that it is so believable. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes well done stories and intense gory fun action.<br/><br/>Rating: 7/10<br/><br/>Thank you for reading my review, any feedback is greatly appreciated!"

","Ever since seeing a screening of Timur Bekmambetov's Russian masterpiece ""Night Watch,"" I've made it a habit to watch anything the producer / director puts his stamp of approval on. Most everything he's been involved in I've liked or appreciated. His movie ""Wanted"" is probably my favorite action vehicle of the last decade. It doesn't seem like anything in that genre can thrill me after witnessing all the unbelievable scenes and adrenalized energy emanated by that film. Even the movie ""9,"" which he produced with Tim Burton, was interesting even in its imperfection.<br/><br/>Bekmambetov has hit gold again with ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter."" Successfully marrying history with horror and vampire lore is risky business. Some people get very touchy when you start playing with historical figures and happenings. Original book author Seth Grahame-Smith wrote the screenplay, leading me to believe the final outcome is the way he wanted it to be. Obviously, Bekmambetov added the martial arts flavor to the mix.<br/><br/>""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" is an entertaining movie that will have Americans cheering for their country while simultaneously enjoying some great decapitations and gore. I saw a screening of the film on Juneteenth and it really helped hit home the importance of what Lincoln did for the U.S. in a fun and unique way. Much like ""30 Days of Night,"" this is a return to the world of scary vampires. These bloodsuckers don't sparkle in the sun and quote romantic poetry.

Now If you are going to go see a good action movie then this will be a good choice. This is a work of fiction which uses one of the greatest president of United states as the main character and some of the historical events that happened during his lifetime. The acting was very well done, esp the characters played by Benjamin walker and Dominic copper were very well done. I personally think the whole cast did their jobs very well. Action sequences were fun and well directed. Timur the director did a great job in making this movie( really liked his work in Wanted and night watch) . The story was changed ago some extent from how is it in the book, and maybe would have liked to see some other parts of the book that were not part of the movie, but overall had a great time watching this movie. and will go see it again.

"jacksonh0608","8","5","10","22 June 2012"," Completely ridiculous, terribly unrealistic, and an absolutely great time at the movies!
","So let's analyze this at a basic level. How many movies have been made about a president that kills vampires AND saves the union? Well obviously this is the first. With the potential to be a complete flop, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter holds its ground with adrenaline pumping action sequences and creative connections with the vampires' involvement in the Civil War. Is it silly? Well duh, we all saw that coming. But like Blade and Underworld, it redeems vampire movies (after Twilight screwed it up). What makes the action scenes so alive is the same slow motion action that made 300 such a hit. My only complaint in the movie is part of its middle section when the vampire action temporarily comes to a halt. For plot development purposes it's necessary; maybe just lasted a little too long. It's a great time at the movies and good, bloody, ax spinning, vampire killing fun."
"WeponX","6","6","13","21 June 2012"," Not the best, but a night of decent fun.
","I saw a pre-screening with minimal expectations, and I must say it exceeded them, so that was good.<br/><br/>To get things straight, I did not go into this thinking I was in for an amazing story or amazingly fleshed out characters. I don't see any reason these kinds of films can't be 10/10s when you take them in their proper context but it definitely leaves you wanting more out of what you watched, regardless of genre or expectations. There is a faint sense of something lacking in the film...okay maybe more like a molding cheese on a rotten apple stench, but that doesn't mean there still aren't more delicious snacks in this film's refrigerator! <br/><br/>I would say the movie is simply flawed in small areas, nothing on a grand scale. There's lack of exposition on why certain things are the way they are, and essentially you have to suspend your disbelief further and further with every scene. There is a consistent lack of consistency in how the action scenes play out. This constantly leaving you wondering why characters didn't die amidst what you just saw on screen, or asking yourself ""how the f*ck did this black dude learn to flip around and fight vamps?"", not to mention a few cheap set-ups with even cheaper payoffs. Even though you're not suppose to be looking too far into the action sequences for something like that, because they're made to look cool, and they do, but it definitely takes you out of the experience at moments because what you're seeing just completely defies logic, even within the universe they've created for this film. As I said, each new action scene requires you to expand your bandwidth of disbelief, and you can't help but notice that you're kind of accommodating the film's need for you to do that. Like a Russian Doll that never ends, you keep having to remind yourself, ""well the way this scene is playing out is f*cking retarded, but then again it is Abe Lincoln fighting vampires"". You shouldn't have to say that to yourself in a well done film, even of this genre. But this film is far from poorly done either.<br/><br/>To get a little more picky, I'd say the first act of the film runs a little too fast, kind of rushing the development for Abe's vampire slaying character, which is unfortunate because the set up in the beginning was decent. So yeah things are a little speedy at first, especially after the inciting incident and first act turning point.<br/><br/>Overall, a solid 6/10. Entertaining, over the top, and a little ridiculous for reasons other than the obvious. I put this one on the level of ""21 Jump Street"" in that even though it fulfilled many of the genre expectations, was decently entertaining, and had a lot of heart to it, both films still fall a little short because both seemed to forget what really matters to keep your audience curious, a decent story that we can get lost in as a viewer.<br/><br/>I'm only giving the negative critiques I have of the film because you will still get what you want and expect from this film, fun visuals, a few laughs, some legitimately cool action scenes (and not just in the traditional sense, but something that actually seems a little fresh in style. Do I dare to claim after the 70 minute point or so the action gets a little too absurd?). The only thing that really stands out to me in the end is that it seems like there was no significant need for Honest Abe to be the protagonist. This could have worked just as well and been just as much fun with any other host of characters. The historical context wasn't really necessary for me. Maybe I'll scope the book and see how it works there.<br/><br/>If you liked ""300"" and can deal with a story as coherent as ""21 Jump Street"" you will get some fun out of this. History buffs and Vampire buffs, stay away, I don't even know where to begin with the accuracy and lack of explanation issues for both American history and why it needs to tie into this story, and the lack of exposition on what may or may not have been altered in the vampire mythos.<br/><br/>Watch this baked out of your mind and I can essentially assure a great time. Sober? Well I can't say I'd recommend it but I certainly wouldn't discourage anyone curious to check it out. If you actually wanna see this movie, I think based on that alone you will likely enjoy yourself!<br/><br/>I came out feeling like I could have used a little more in certain areas of the film, but also felt like I had been entertained, but just not nearly as much as I should have been. I dunno, maybe compare it to Pauly Shore's best movie or something, minus his voice appearances in Disney films. Easily forgettable but potentially memorable. Overall, I think it's worth taking a risk on if you're pondering forking out the cash for it, but I'd recommend cheap Tuesday or a paid date."

"marcusman48","4","3","5","16 October 2014"," Can't mix Buffy with politics
","I actually saw Steven Spielberg's LINCOLN before I saw this one, and in retrospect I wish I'd done things the other way around. The Spielberg film was was skillfully acted and directed, especially with Daniel Day-Lewis in the title role, even if it got bogged down too much in the politics of the 1860s at the expense of focusing on Abraham Lincoln the man. But ABRAHAM LINCOLN VAMPIRE HUNTER ultimately falls short because it tries to do two different things and fails at both of them.<br/><br/>I can't complain about the film's technical aspects, which are about as good as Hollywood gets. And the performances of Benjamin Walker and Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Abe and his wife Mary Todd, respectively, are appealing, even if they're hardly historically accurate even without the vampire stuff. But the central premise of the movie is flawed, at least if you serve it straight-up.<br/><br/>I admit I did not read Seth Graham-Smith's book, which I've heard is superior to the film adaptation. Maybe it's unfair of me to judge one medium by another. But the filmmakers missed a huge opportunity to make ABRAHAM LINCOLN VAMPIRE HUNTER truly entertaining by trying - among other things - to make it a ""serious"" vampire story. I know one shouldn't always be prejudiced by the title of something, but a movie with a title like this one makes you expect an extra-large helping of horror-camp, like the original BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER movie or Quentin Tarantino's FROM DUSK TILL DAWN (both of which are enjoyable films, even if they're not excellent ones). But here everything is played (no pun intended) deadly seriously and with very little humor. You have to imagine that Honest Abe, who loved telling funny stories, would himself be disappointed.<br/><br/>But all the earnestness doesn't simply make the film boring and depressing; it ruins any chance the story might have had of resonating with audiences. It sucks (again, no pun) all the fun out of vampires by trying to link them to the Confederate States of America. (""Hey, vampires are evil and slavery is evil, so they must be linked somehow, right?"") And having the real-life death of Abe's son Will be the result of a vampire disguised as a servant biting the boy would be monstrously insensitive if it weren't so thoroughly absurd. I can't imagine Mary Todd screaming accusations at Abe about their boy being killed in such a way; I'd much rather expect her to just get angry at the VAMPIRES and set about gathering up crucifixes and whittling stakes.<br/><br/>There's one other major problem I just couldn't come to terms with: the idea that the Battle of Gettysburg was actually a fight against vampires in Confederate uniforms, and that the Union soldiers destroyed them by shooting them with silver bullets and goring them with silver bayonet points. Assuming you even try to accept this at face value, how in God's name did it manage to stay out of the history books? After all, the secret of Gettysburg would have been known to Abe, Mary, the entire Lincoln Cabinet, EVERYONE in the War Department, top military leadership, and all the thousands of men who fought and survived. Even if Abe himself wanted to keep it all under wraps, surely SOMEONE would have blabbed.<br/><br/>See ABRAHAM LINCOLN VAMPIRE HUNTER for the novelty value only. There is really no reason to watch it a second time."

","A film with Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president of the United States, the guy with the iconic beard and a very tall top hat, hunting vampires? Sounds like fun!<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this film takes itself way too seriously, which is kinda baffling considering the title and the synopsis. It's not all garbage, but with light-hearted action and the thrill of supernatural violence written all over the premise, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter proves to be a major let-down.<br/><br/>Maybe a simpler story would've helped? Why have so many pieces in it, when all people come to see here is what has been promised even before the film started: Mr. President kicking some fang-toothed butt amidst the internal turmoil of 19th century USA. Considering that being the main attraction here, the tone is also all wrong. Why so serious? If a point is being made here, it's really being lost in all the blood and the ax-wielding.<br/><br/>Admittedly this film does have some cool shots and some nicely inventive action. But in the end, a neater package and a lighter approach would've been the key to success. Now it's bouncing off the walls and running and bumping into household objects like a 3-year-old on a sugar high.<br/><br/>If they ever decide to make Teddy Roosevelt: Zombie Hunter or George Washington: Alien Hunter I hope they take note of all this and treat us to some quality leave-your-brain-at-the-cloakroom fun this film promised but failed to properly deliver."

But, in the long run, it did absolutely nothing to evoke any reverence in me over the apparent charisma and political might of its title character.<br/><br/>I, for one, sure hope that using U.S. presidents as a cheap marketing ploy to sell second-rate horror movies isn't going to turn into a new trend in this business of show business.<br/><br/>P.S. - It really killed me that this film started off with a ridiculously laughable, out-of-context quote from the Bible - Genesis 17:5 (Look it up if you're at all interested)"

The film lacks many things: originality, acting, storyline, and directing. First, the film is very much like watching an episode of Supernatural (at least Supernatural had a better way to kill vamps). There is no original way to kill a vampire here. Everything is the same: stake, sunlight, crosses, etc. Second, the acting is horrible. The lead actor tries too hard to be the clumsy, intelligent, vampire killer that closely resembles a Clark Kent double. His acting is dull, and unlikeable. Next, the storyline is weak! Another sad attempt to achieve originality. The directing is terrible. There are far too many UNBELIEVABLE scenes, even for an action film, that you just begin to laugh.

In revenge and to clear my mental palate, I made my TV companion watch Dangerous Beauty with me the moment this abortion ended (Beauty is not only a much better film, but Sewell got a much better role).<br/><br/>If I could give this loser a ZERO, I would, because it deserves that.

I assumed there would be something special made about Lincoln allowing him to fight the undead. No, there is not. He's just your average president with an axe who has super human speed and strength. <br/><br/>The plot was written by a child hundreds of years ago and has since been copied hundreds of times over the years by story makers who have little imagination.

","There are many options that can result from trying to write a fictional story that contains actual historical characters. Whether it is changing the death of Hitler, the events of the Cold War, or the history of an ancient empire, there are many risks that can come from rewriting history. It can be far-fetched, ridiculous, and stupid to watch, especially for someone who has a strong love for history. But, there is something great that can come from a new story about famous events and figures: the stories can be extremely entertaining.<br/><br/>And no matter how ridiculous or far-fetched it is, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is an incredibly entertaining film.<br/><br/>Rewriting possibly the greatest leader in American history and one of the most recognizable figures ever, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is exactly as titled: the behind the scenes story of Abraham Lincoln as not only our 16th president, but as an axe wielding, monster slaying hunter as well. And while this idea could get exceedingly out of hand, the film is surprisingly well constructed around the actual life of Abraham Lincoln and incorporates the vampires in a smart manner rather than a stupid sideshow.<br/><br/>Originally written as a novel by Seth Grahame-Smith (the writer also behind Pride and Prejudice and Zombies), Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter starts off in Lincoln's youth, when his mother is murdered by a vampire his father had crossed. The film then moves through his training as a young adult with another experienced hunter to his relationship with Mary Todd and other friends all the way to being elected president of the United States of America where he would lead the Union against the Confederate south and the allied vampires.<br/><br/>I know what you may be thinking: ""Allied Confederate vampires? That's a little much."" But it really isn't. Even though the vampires are incorporated throughout the legacy of Lincoln and placed into some of the major moments of his presidency, it never seems stupid. Unrealistic duh. Ridiculoussure. But it is always more fun than stupid. Taking an extremely respected figure and leader and changing his memory to a vampire slaying, ruthless hunter? Yeah, there is plenty of entertainment there.<br/><br/>To read the rest of the review (IMDb form too short) visit: http://custodianfilmcritic.com/abraham-lincoln-vampire-hunter/"
"drarcade99","6","3","5","24 June 2012"," Great story, poor execution really...
","I'm giving this a 6 out of 10. I had to really consider my review as I graded it. The reminder for the reader is that the 6 of 10 isn't inherently bad and some of the criticisms might not really matter to you so feel free to add #'s to my value.<br/><br/>I had the privilege of reading the book prior to the movie release. I have to emphasize that the book really is fantastic and well-written. The author's sense of pace and fluidity is great!<br/><br/>That being said, the movie tries to mimic some parts of the storyline but naturally misses a bunch of major plot elements. While I know all book-to-film adaptations suffer this issue, I feel the movie's plot is a bit nebulous due to some elements being left out. What really sticks out in my mind is the reason why Abe returned to wed Mary after Josh Speed emphasize that he cannot let his distaste for Mary's father's business. Instead, they removed that component entirely and it ends up making Mr. Speed's character a little odd in the movie. I had a hard time understanding exactly what he's doing?<br/><br/>Another really major component I felt the movie missed was the real explanation of why the vampires aligned with the South. In the book, it was a rather grotesques scene where a vampire purchased ""undesired slaves"" at a slave auction and took them to a barn to dine on between the vampire and his buddies. The book almost added a complexity to this by Abe's noticing that the vampire would only bid on ""lame young boys or elderly women"" to dine on. I just feel the movie really didn't set the situation up to understand what really drives Abe's later actions as President. Similarly, they relegated Henry's rather charismatic character in the book to what seemed to be a troubled counter- revolutionary vampire? <br/><br/>Now that I criticized the movie for its content, I would definitely say the movie is, in itself, an enjoyable one. The fight scenes were a little unbelievable but frankly if you're concerned of the believability of a fight scene when one of the parties is a vampire, then it's fair to say that you're being unreasonable. In themselves, the fights scenes were fun and ""kick-ass"" if I may. I saw the 3D version... it was mediocre.<br/><br/>This movie might be better suited as one you'd buy and watch at home from time to time for some mildly silly but kinda inspirational period action film.<br/><br/>The acting was actually pretty good. I feel the director fumbled on this one. <br/><br/>In conclusion, I will say, I recommend everyone definitely read the book if you liked the movie. The book is quite fantastic and adds several layers of complexity to the story. I give 6 out of 10... not because it's a bad movie... but it took on too much. <br/><br/>P.S. As a final note because I read it in a fellow reviewer's comment: this movie is absolutely not racist in the least. In fact, the movie diluted more frank talk in the book of racism that pervaded the south. That statement by a fellow reviewer is complete poppycock."

","Benjamin Walker is Abe Lincoln in this, what should be rather silly Movie. The title and concept was so outrageous I had to see it. I was surprised to see how well they merged the ""vampire"" story in with what we know about the historical man.<br/><br/>As a boy Abe sees ""Jack Barts"" (Marton Czokas) beating on his colored friend Will Johnson. He attacks, causing Barts to take revenge on his mother. This begins a mission of vengeance that has to be put on hold due to a promise to his father (Joseph Mawle) - After whose death he is freed of the obligation to not do anything crazy, he immediately finds his fortification of liquid courage and goes after Barts - and therefore finds himself in a World of Hurt. Rescued by ""Henry Sturges"" (Dominic Cooper), he is trained how to use his weapon of choice, a silver-plated Axe, to do away with Vampires.<br/><br/>So Sturges sends him packing to Illinois, with a list of names to deal with. But Barts has not forgotten that Lincoln had shot out his eye. And is stalking him as he courts Mary Todd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), leading to a final battle between Barts and Lincoln: Who reveals an unpleasant truth to Abe before Abe removes an unsightly head - Sturges is a vampire as well!<br/><br/>The way this is played out, is not verbal, but visual. Sturges tells his story to Abe in a vignette showing how ""Adam"" - That father of all vampires - Had converted him using his own wife's (Teri Wyble) blood. And a new twist is added to the ages old mythology of vampires - They cannot harm each other. Ergo, Sturges through the years has been training Slayers to kill those who did this to him, and Lincoln is just the latest one.<br/><br/>Lincoln marries Mary Todd and tells Sturges he is unconcerned, Adam of course does not know who he is. But unfortunately Barts had Lincoln's pocket watch in his gripping hand as he was killed, and Adam finds the watch in Bart's Coffin. And so Adam invites Abe to a ""ball"" using his childhood friend Will Johnson (Anthony Mackie) as ""bait."" Lincoln then tells his employer Joshua ""Speed"" (Jimmi Simpson) the whole sordid story and brings him in to help. So Abe confronts Adam (Rufus Sewell) - Who has him at a disadvantage, trapping him. Adam tells Abe his long history using some interesting animation, and gives Abe a choice: Kill Sturges, or be made into a vampire using Will's blood. But Joshua has a ""calvary to the rescue"" moment and rides his stagecoach into Adam's house... And as they escape, they meet another historical figure: Harriet Tubman of the ""Underground Railroad"" - This is the first time ""Lincoln's Train"" is brought up.<br/><br/>It is after these events, Lincoln puts away his Axe and is more or less his historical self. He is seen arguing with Stephen A. Douglas (a cameo by Alan Tudyk) at the beginning of his political career. As Sturges had put it: ""Always have a contingency plan"" and we see this referred to several times in this film. In this case, Abe had developed a career in Politics, and for a time sets down the Axe.<br/><br/>But the heat rises when he becomes President: The institution of Slavery had been used to feed a growing population of Vampires in the South, with their needs being sated that way, they stayed put. But now, Slavery is Abolished, and the vampires take an active role in the Civil War on the side of The South: And there are a few scenes of Civil War reenactments that are wonderfully done, especially one classic scene where a particular Northern Captain is the only one left standing after the Vampire Southern Soldiers sweep away all of his men.<br/><br/>The vampires take personal revenge on Abe Lincoln, and Mary Todd is on the verge of being driven mad. But with the loss of his son, Lincoln is shown the solution: With one and only one chance of beating them. So he loads a train full of this ""solution"" - Only to be betrayed by Joshua Speed.<br/><br/>But Honest Abe has some tricks of his own, and he finally pulls the old Axe out of mothballs, not as limber as he was when he was younger, but he soon finds his moves. So it becomes a race to Gettysberg - Can Abe get there first, or will his train get derailed?<br/><br/>But Abraham Lincoln has more than one Train..."

","I admit, when I first heard about this movie I was really sceptical. Who wouldn't? It sounds completely absurd even as a work of fiction. Who'd think of putting Lincoln and Vampires together in one movie? But after seeing the first trailer I was really looking forward to this as it had the dark mood and right amount of action you'd expect from such a film.<br/><br/>The movie itself is amazing. It wasn't complete fiction where everything was just a story. The important parts of history where in this. Obviously not as they happened, with the Vampires, but always with a touch of real happenings. The deaths of Lincolns mother Nancy and son William, the marriage with Mary Todd, travelling on the Mississippi to New Orleans, his view on slavery and the war, just to mention a view. I as a Vampire fan from child days on thought the way they were portrayed was just right. They might not have been burnt by the sunlight and have two main fangs rather than only fangs but other than that the way they were shown was great. I think seeing this in 3D would've been even better. The action scenes were just right, maybe not as harsh as some thought but to me it didn't have to be all brutal. In fact if it would've been the rest of the story might have been pushed to the background. As I said in other reviews I always like to mention the music as a movie would be nothing without it. It either complements the film or disturbs it with unnecessary songs and sounds. The music was just right, adding the dark mood more intense than a picture only. Last thing: though the final scene was a nice work of graphic going from past to modern present I think the movie should have ended with the Monument done.<br/><br/>9/10, nothing really big I can subtract besides the few little points mentioned. If you're a fan of mystical, fictional movies, not even necessarily with Vampires but also just monsters, this is just for you."

Character exposition, no. Story development, no. I've never read the comic but I pray to god it was better than this. To even have a basic comprehension or love of it you'd need to give sh*t about American history (and being non-American I do not) and then if you do you need to be able to mould it to stupid possible interpretations. To be honest that sounds far more sophisticated than this film deserves. It was just a nonsense, period, supernatural action film concerning a man which 99% of the Earth's population had heard of and kind of respected but couldn't really give a cr*p about. I realise it's not meant to be an accurate historical portrayal but it tries to be so much more intelligent than it is. Even if you accept that the world is full of Vamps it still makes no sense. for example AbeL only realised, very late in the day, that silver is bad for Vamps.

"3xHCCH","9","4","8","5 July 2012"," A Very ORIGINAL Film!
","This movie's poster came out quite early on this year, and I was really very intrigued by it. The title and concept are really so far-out-of- this-world original, I can't wait to see how this story would unfold. After a long wait, how timely was it that a movie about a great American president(albeit an action-horror-fantasy one) would be shown right on the 4th of July where I am? Cool, huh?<br/><br/>The film opens with Abraham Lincoln on a voice-over talking about how History prefers legends to men, then flashes back to his childhood when young Abe witnesses his mother being killed by what seemed to be a vampire. The desire to seek vengeance on the ghoulish murderer would carry him over the next years as the child grew up. After a botched attempt, he meets a vampire-killer named Henry Sturgess (Dominic Cooper) who trains him in the killing craft using his weapon of choice, the axe. <br/><br/>From there, this fantastic back story would then intertwine with more historically-familiar events we knew about Abe Lincoln, like his marriage to Mary Todd, his rise to the Presidency, the Emancipation Proclamation, the Civil War, the Gettysburg Address and his fateful date at the theater. This is practically everything the layman knows about Abe Lincoln. Even viewers with only a passing knowledge of American history can readily relate. You simply have to watch to see how they dovetail the fantasy parts into the history parts.<br/><br/>I must say that this movie more than lives up to the high expectations I had of it. OK, the stylized violence may not sit well with all audiences, but for me everything just fit in so well. The writing by the book's author himself, Seth Grahame-Smith, was excellent. I really congratulate him for his awesomely radical idea. It was so crazy it just had to work!<br/><br/>The story treatment by the director (whose name I have never heard of before), Timur Bekmambetov, had just the right touch of tongue-in-cheek humor to balance out the gore and make the whole thing work without being overly cheesy (like the ""Twilight"" films). I have never seen scenes like that fight atop the stampeding horses, or those sieges at Gettysburg, among so many other visionary scenes executions throughout the film. Those were really amazingly triumphant visual effects! They have succeeded to make a bona-fide American hero even larger-than-life and more noble than he was already known for. <br/><br/>As far as the actors are concerned, there were no really big stars here. Only Dominic Cooper was the familiar face, and he did really well as Abe's mentor Henry. At the start I had a small problem with the lead star Benjamin Walker as I did not really believe him to be Abraham Lincoln as a young man. He simply did not seem correct as the young Abe the way he looked and acted. This situation was of course corrected when the wonders of make-up came in when he was already President. I really believe the Make-up of this movie deserves an Oscar nomination at least as it really transformed Walker into the Abraham Lincoln we all expected. This was my one minor gripe about the film although later in my overall appreciation of the movie, Walker's seeming physical disconnect as Lincoln did not really matter after all in the end.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie to true vampire fans and history fans alike. As odd as that combination is, I am sure there are plenty of us out there."

","As if old Abe wasn't lionised enough, they had to make him a vampire slayer. I saw this film hoping it would provide the same level of satisfaction as Stephen Sommers' 'Van Helsing'. As usual, I expected too much. <br/><br/>The film fails chiefly because of the limitations of its protagonist. Unknown Benjamin Walker plays Lincoln with an esprit more appropriate for less ludicrous material. Abe's arsenal is nothing more than his axe. Yes, it is also an unlikely gun, but the trailer saw to it that that wasn't going to be a surprise. Action choreography is clichéd (apart from an exhilarating horse stampede), and the countless slo-mos are infuriating. And I predicted the train decoy. The effects are suitably spooky, but I have no respect for vamps that can't fight. <br/><br/>Prolific actor Dominic Cooper ('The Devil's Double', 'The History Boys') is very well miscast as Henry Sturgess, Lincoln's disgruntled vampire friend and coach. The part needed someone older, more grizzled and more interested in their subsidiary role. <br/><br/>Elementary goofs turn this fantasy into farce. Why doesn't Abe question Henry's superhuman strength when he sees him dispatch a vamp? The plot reveals that vamps can't kill their own, but why does this stop Henry from intervening and at least setting them up for Abe to axe into oblivion? He's a lazy, unproductive sort, who talks a good game but goes missing when punches fly. Also, how is it that Henry manages to control his vampiric urges? Must be those blood patches I've read about.<br/><br/>History is cheekily distorted to make vamps culpable for slavery. Propaganda? I wouldn't rule it out. The whole film is ridiculous, but what was I expecting from 'Wanted' director Timur Bekmambetov? He was, after all, born in the same country as Borat.<br/><br/>www.moseleyb13.com"

"EmmaDinkins","7","4","8","24 June 2012"," Chix Chat on Film Review: Abraham Lincoln's other job.
","This film was not my first choice out of all that premiered this weekend, however it was my husband Mike's birthday weekend so the choice was his. Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter (Benjamin Walker) is the story of the 16th president of the United States extracurricular activities of preparing to become an attorney and slaying vampires. The first as the result of brutality he witnesses as a child against Will Johnson (Anthony Mackie) his friend, and the latter spurred by the death of his mother the victim of a vampire as seen in the trailer. I was a bit apprehensive about seeing this film and felt that it would be a major slight to the president who dared to unite the union by abolishing slavery. But I will admit that it was interesting how the vampire tale was woven into history. I am growing weary of vampire stories and I had to revise my way of thinking about the integration into the life of a man that was instrumental in making my quality of life possible. I realized that this telling was really not that different from Forrest Gump teaching Elvis to wiggle his hips or the discovery that Transformers were the catalyst for the Apollo space program. The story begins with a narration from Abraham to his lifelong friend Henry Sturgess (Dominic Cooper), who I found to be the most intriguing character of those featured primarily because his conflicts of conscience were the most compelling. I would say that this film is the first time that I have seen Mary Elizabeth Winstead (Mary Todd Lincoln) portray an adult character, she is typically a teen or early twenty-something but she came across very convincingly as the First Lady. I mentioned Anthony Mackie was in this film, bottom line if he's in the film I'm with it. I saw the film in 3D, but I honestly do not feel that the premium for 3-D is necessary for this film. The special effects were pretty cool especially the stampeding horse scene, however I just don't think anything would have been lost had I viewed the regular HD version of the film. There were a few moments that the computer generated imagery was just too obvious like the aerial view of Gettysburg, and other moments that were so far-fetched that it was hard to refrain from uttering an audible 'seriously' like the flaming bridge train scene. But overall it was entertaining enough that I give it an amber light"
"rattdpp","7","4","8","23 June 2012"," Enjoyable, but not perfect
","they changed and skipped a lot from the book and there were more things i wish they had added - Lincoln's mother and his step mother were very important figures in his life and they did gloss over the early years very quickly - to me, the beginning of the movie was the weakest, slowest part and it didn't really get going for me until he established himself in Springfield. I thought it picked up a good amount once he got into politics and was a pretty good movie from there.<br/><br/>The movie looked really good from a historical perspective - the scenery was nicely done for the most part - the look of the major historical figures was pretty accurate with the notable exception of Mary Todd - who was way too pretty and thin - but a really good actress. In real life Lincoln didn't marry her for her looks anyway - he married her because of her position and the status he would gain from their union.<br/><br/>I really liked all the major characters - the acting went really well for the most part. I liked the musical score, but some of the (mostly early) action scenes were a bit over the top - and there was one sequence I highly doubt even Jackie Chan could have pulled off. But i guess everyone in the 1800's was a circus performer One thing that really got me after a bit was that the director is a big fan of slowing down the action so you can see how spiffy every stunt looks in slow motion. That kind of got old, but it was nice in some spots - just overused.<br/><br/>I thought it was entertaining once you got over the really weak beginning, but yeah it skipped too many events and had problems.<br/><br/>7-7.5/10 is the range I would give it."

"zhiqiangliu","8","4","8","22 June 2012"," I love Abraham Lincoln and I love this movie so much
","Since I read this novel a few months ago, I have been looking forward to this movie excitedly. It turns out to live up to my expectation. The movie doesn't not strictly follow the book and has changed it a lot. I think most of the changes are successful, though I'm very disappointed the story about Lincoln leading a team to hunt down Jefferson Davis was cut and Ann Rutledge did not even mentioned in the movie. Otherwise, I enjoyed the movie from the beginning to the end.<br/><br/>The movie does not look as that ridiculous as this title. There is the part Abraham played the real vampire hunter who used his axes and guns to kill those evil blood suckers, and on the other side it is the historical Lincoln who believed the Deceleration of Independence, the Union, and the liberty of mankind.In the movie the two themes look close to be seamless. While I enjoyed the exciting actions of fights between Lincoln and vampires, the heated debate between Lincoln and Douglas, his election to the White House, his final dedication to the great Emaciation, and his immortal Gettysburg speech all brought the real life of Lincoln on screen. <br/><br/>I especially like how Mary Todd Lincoln is portrayed in the movie. I know her real life was absolutely miserable. The loss of children and the war had already ruined her happiness (and happiness of millions). But she later lost her beloved her beloved husband and witnessed his assassination, and then lost another son who had became her only comfort after that night at Ford's theater. Historians used to be too strict to her I think and I am glad to see her become a war hero herself in the movie which brings much comfort. <br/><br/>Some people may say it goes to far to relate one of the greatest president to Vampires and it is a little disrespectful. But I think although we should know the real historical Lincoln, he is already a mythical to some extent. In my opinion, making him a mythical hero is just another way to remember the true Abraham Lincoln who sacrificed everything for this country and this world."
"ddwilli1","5","6","14","23 June 2012"," Mostly different from the book
","I am giving this movie a 5 out of 10 because it was halfway completed in regards to story. While I realize that there are too many elements in a book to include in a full length movie, the results here are ridiculous. Main plot elements are both entirely removed or rushed for no reason. I do not understand the reasoning behind this. The book had a captivating story that tried to fit elements of Lincoln's past to make the story more believable. This movie didn't even attempt to do the same. Instead we have new/unnecessary characters and new plot elements that leave you wanting to rip your hair out. I would say it is worth a rental for the book lovers but take the story you grew to love with a grain of salt as this is not the painted picture I hoped it would be."

","As soon as I learned that a film existed with that title I just had to see it, even though I knew it couldn't possibly do it justice. It comes close, however.<br/><br/>Nearly forty years ago I thoroughly enjoyed one of the more obscure Hammer adventures, 'Captain Kronos, Vampire Hunter' (a film sadly now largely forgotten) and had hoped for some of the same jauntiness of tone in this production. Instead we inevitably get the usual over-reliance on CGI and steadicam, and of course it's dominated by men. Mary Elizabeth Winstead however makes a attractive and feisty Mary Todd Lincoln, while Erin Wasson as Vadoma contributes a foxy villainess."

","And so Hollywood churns out YET another lame vampire film packed with rubbish CGI and action that looks like it's been choreographed by a hyperactive 5 year old. Seriously, who choreographs fight scenes like this? The action directors should take a look to their Asian counterparts to see what a real fight scene to look like, not deliver audiences this mess.<br/><br/>The story is non-existent and merely an excuse to shoehorn vampires into a real-life historical scenario. Benjamin Walker, who plays the titular character, is awful; artificial and wooden in his youth, and stupidly fake-looking in his later years. Supporting actors like Dominic Cooper and Rufus Sewell should know better, although Mary Elizabeth Winstead seems to be making a career of appearing in films of middling to poor quality.<br/><br/>The narrative lurches from one set-piece to the next, so there are chase scenes, fights on CGI trains, rubbish-looking battle set-pieces, and a plot so hackneyed that it should have been staked through the heart. In the end though it's the combination of poor quality CGI and badly choreographed fight scenes that make this so pitiful."

Still, after watching this I looked some more titles up and there are actually a lot of monster movies where Abraham Lincoln is the protagonist and kicking a lot of monster butt. Why? I have no idea. That is the main reason why I thought this movie would be horrible, but it was amazing! Lots of action, lots of over the top fighting, but a strong storyline with fiction and reality combined. Tim Burtons magical touch made everything look like a steam-punk fairytale, a fantasy world. I love the vampires in this film: bloodsucking, ugly and non-sparkling.

And I'm glad I did, because that was one of the best uses of my chronic insomnia I've had in a while. Although the movie took itself seriously, it didn't take itself so seriously as to be unintentionally funny, and while the actors had to have known they weren't making Anthony And Cleopatra, they put themselves into their characters quite well. The visuals were very good, and the action sequences were convincing, if a bit far-fetched in places. All in all, I'm glad I watched it. Sure, it's not Lawrence Of Arabia, but it was never supposed to be; instead, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is entertainment well done, and as such, it's an enjoyable watch."

","For most people this would be an good or average movie, but for me it was just bad start to finish, just because, apart from the characters and places, nothing in the movie is like the book at all, and for this reason I think the movie ruined the book. One of Abe's first lovers, was missed out from the movie, which really makes a hole in the plot as she is supposed to change Abe as a character. Further more Abe's mother (in the movie) doesn't speak to Abe in her last moments, the words that compel Lincoln to do what he does.<br/><br/>I know it is hard to show a characters thought in a movie, but it doesn't show his suicidal thoughts after each character's death!<br/><br/>Overall it wasn't a bad movie, but it was a poor movie based on the book."

","My wife and I just watched this movie on DVD, and I can report that we both enjoyed our viewing. This is significant in and of itself, as my wife as rule does not enjoy action, supernatural and/or horror movies - all of which categories you could make a case that this film fell within. I think what made the movie enjoyable is that the fiction became somewhat believable played against the historical context which most people have at least some familiarity. I kept thinking to myself during the film that the premise that Vampires defined Lincoln's actions as well as the politics during the dark period of slavery in America, was as good a premise as any other historic biographical. Quite frankly, I find that most of the purported true biographic films so misrepresent fact that they might as well be works of fiction. Was the movie flawed? Of course it was, but the other reviewers who totally trash this film based predominantly on their assessment of the movie not being true to the book are foolish. I did not read the book, probably never would have as it is not my type of novel; however, the movie should be rated and evaluated wholly on its own merits. The movie was fun, fast-paced, and absolutely different then the same old recycled story lines and remakes. Just watch and enjoy."
"ryan-craven-528-410093","3","2","3","1 April 2013"," Offensive, stupid and unintentionally hilarious.
","Hilariously, almost endearingly stupid, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter succeeds only as so bad it's funny cannon fodder. Pitched as a what if scenario, the film follows Lincoln through his early days, struggling with a need to avenge his family's death by the hands of a, you guessed it, vampire.<br/><br/>The book from which this is based on, of the same name, is wholly entertaining because it accepts the ridiculousness of the premise and plays in it, giving it a wink to the audience charm and wit. However, Wanted director Timur Bekmambekov, with a lesser cast and a lesser budget, fails to even acknowledge its own stupidity and instead opts to play it completely, seriously straight, making this a dull exercise in slow mo action and tedious cliché.<br/><br/>And so the film has to rely on the (limited) talents of its cast to pull the mess of a script together, and for the most part, they don't. Straddled with the Po faced role of the hero, Benjamin Walker fails even at being the Po faced hero, instead registering as a humourless, witless and idiotic impersonation of the great president, especially misfiring on the suitably misfiring romance between him and co star Mary Elizabeth Winstead, between this there is no chemistry, or in fact, sign of anything but air between them, which begs the question why bother with the love story and instead just make a 80 minute gore, slow mo and CGI fest of generic and repetitive action scenes of which the director is so, so fond of? Less poor, and by some miracle quite impressive, is Dominic Cooper, who, with the more extravagant role of 'Henry' the vampire hunter's trainer (as ridiculous as it sounds), stands out as the only actor in this who is both a) genuinely exerting some effort on his facial muscles and b) way too talented to be in an undercooked, overblown and offensively serious as this steaming, hot mess.<br/><br/>This is made all the more surprising when the screenwriter is the author, Seth Grahame Smith, who is evidently much more talented as a novelist than a screenwriter. The sheer lack of depth in the depicting of Lincoln is as disconcerting as it is awful; the only mildly interesting thing they seem to reveal about Honest Abe is his affinity to killing vampires. An attempt to add some humanity to him in the latter stages is as misjudged as the prosthetics they added to Walker's facial features, which looks to have cost around £3 from the local arts and crafts store. His dialogue, hindered by line upon line of clumsy exposition, has at least a slip shod, B-movie charm to it, with such pearls as 'I was out freeing slaves' or my personal favourite 'they say he's a madman'. <br/><br/>Verdict: In many ways, the acting in Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter by the lead and many of the supporting cast may well be a work of tongue in cheek ingenious; an, unbeknownst to the director, mutiny against the terrible script and tone of this, the worst film of 2012. Appealing only to fools and pre pubescent schoolboys."
"lethalweapon","5","2","3","18 October 2012"," Delivers what it promises. Stupid, but entertaining.
","Just watched 'Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter' (2012)<br/><br/>History's not my strong suit, but I have this nagging feeling that they seem to have taken liberties with some of the historical facts here. ;)<br/><br/>Just reading the title of the movie, I won't fault you for thinking how ridiculous the premise is. It's likely to be the first thought that would spring up, and I won't fault you for that, cos... well, it IS kinda ridiculous.<br/><br/>But the title sums up the movie - the tone, the premise, the setting, the era, the genre, the plot. Never has a movie title been so revealing since 2006's 'Snakes on a Plane'<br/><br/>But you should not be disappointed. If someone read the title of the movie (which is the least amount of pre-watch research you need to do for ANY movie), you can hardly be surprised at what you get. Unless you were forced to watch the movie at gunpoint, you don't really have a right to complain on this one. <br/><br/>Abraham Lincoln is one of my favourite leaders, and I was wondering why they chose him as the subject for historic mangling, even if it's for fun. Of course, he was a physical guy, with a lot of energy. But why not pick out a fictional president? Of course, a story about a fictional vampire hunting president may not pull in as much bemused attention as latching on to a big name like L, seemingly pulling out the unwritten pages of history. But there was more to it. The vampire movement was linked to slavery, and Lincoln's presidency was a pivotal element of setting the slaves free. <br/><br/>I'm sure they didn't select Lincoln because he was the emancipating president. I think they chose emancipation as a central plot premise so that the plot would fit Lincoln. In either case, the end product is a good watch.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong - the movie is as stupid and illogical as its premise. It has flimsy character development, sketchy plot, pointless villainy and unintentionally funny action sequences. But it's still enjoyable for a one time watch. And the special effects used in recreating the old era were quite interesting.<br/><br/>The movie was promoted as Tim Burton's movie, but it's actually directed by Timur Bekmambetov. I was about to complain about the bait and switch maneuver here, but then again, I should have read the poster more carefully, I guess."
"OrsonLannister","6","2","3","23 June 2012"," Better than I thought, not as good as it should have been
","So close! That was my first thought when the credits for Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter began to roll. I am no fan of the book, I was only mildly excited for the movie, and I came out mildly disappointed. Why? Because it could have been so much more! It SHOULD have been. If the first half of this movie is any indication, it had big, metaphorical aspirations.<br/><br/>However, the final result is still quite decent. No, not decent as in, ""Oh, look at its title! Shut off your brain and have a good time!"" No, not decent as in, ""I had a fun time and the blood was really cool!"" This movie was legitimately decent.<br/><br/>The whole concept of transforming the ideology of slavery into an embodiment of evil is clever, and this idea is not lost on the script's translation to the big screen. On one side of the spectrum, this movie can be viewed purely as a metaphor for Lincoln's historical deeds and character.<br/><br/>However, this concept also sets up AL:VH for its biggest flaw. The first half of the film runs with this alternate universe for Abraham Lincoln, and it succeeds wildly. We are given characters we accept, circumstances we appreciate, and relationships with which we agree. The pace is frenetic, the dialogue well-executed, and the acting enjoyable.<br/><br/>But instead of keeping this attitude throughout its run time, the movie changes mood. Near the halfway point, the movie loses momentum due to a stale plot development that allows for the vampires to be leading the South in the Civil War. The action becomes ""meh"" and the characters no longer seem like legitimate people.<br/><br/>Why doesn't it work? Firstly, AL:VH tries too hard to include more history in its second half. With Lincoln as president and leading the Civil War, the vampire actions seems out of place and just silly. This is because instead of REPLACING the historical events with the metaphorical vampires, or at least downplaying the history, AL:VH tries to reconcile the two and the result is downright boring (for example, did anyone REALLY care about that whole ""get the silver to Gettysburg"" plot line?) Also, we are subjected to some seriously bad makeup. The ""aging"" between early Lincoln to president Lincoln consists of a few wrinkles and a beard, and the co-stars fare even worse. Also, side characters stick around for too long, and we don't care about them. The shopkeeper is a poorly written character and never has a fleshed out personality, and Lincoln's black friend (whose unremarkable name escapes me) is also too insignificant but inexplicably good at killing vampires.<br/><br/>In the end, DO SEE Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter for its cool action (eons ahead of that atrocity with similar effects, ""Immortals""), great visuals, and hints of moral poignancy and historical metaphors. But don't expect complete satisfaction."

","Good stuff. First off, ignore the negative reviews - I really don't understand what is wrong with those people – were the expecting Fellini or Coppola? This is an action, quasi-horror, quasi-love story that plays on some aspects of history to deliver a curiously entertaining movie.<br/><br/>We follow Lincoln from his youth to his demise. We learn that aside from his politics, he has been drawn into the world of vampires when one of them kills his mother (as an act of revenge because his parents stood up to slave drivers). Sounds ridiculous doesn't it? Somehow it all works. Abe is obsessed with avenging his mother's murder and that's what launches this movie into the land of the weird. <br/><br/>As a viewer I found that I liked Abe, liked his wife (Mary Todd probably did not look this good), liked his friends and enjoyed the high intensity action scenes. There's not a lot of character development but there is enough to make it interesting. Of course there's a ""big villain "" and a showdown. What I didn't expect was the great cinematography in some of scenes – the show down on horses and the train scene were awesome, almost hallucinatory. <br/><br/>It's a fun movie with likable characters, action, some suspense and some odd twists on history. Much, much better than I expected. <br/><br/>Just put it on, don't overthink it and have a good time. I've seen it several times and it doesn't disappoint."

","Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter... who could be drawn to a theater by this title?! I thought it must be either parody or some low-budget crap and I had no intention to watch it at all. Yet, curiosity prevailed. I decided to take a look at every 15 minutes or so, just to get a basic idea of what it looks like. I could expect anything from this movie, but I could not possibly expect it to be any good. And not only it is good, it is great.<br/><br/>The story is some kind of alternative history. It follows the life of Abraham Lincoln from early childhood to tragic death, but pervades his whole biography with vampires. It goes so far to claim vampires to be part of the cause of slavery in America and Civil War to be a war of human North against vampire-ruled South. It also gives a very interesting explanation of battle for Gettysburg. But I'll stop here to avoid serious spoilers. <br/><br/>Interesting, but not complicated. It has elements of drama, horror, romance, western, supernatural, historical, biographical and action movie. Intelligent and well written and packed dialogues with some humor relief. Choice and performances of the actors are great, good directing and soundtrack, high-level production and special effects that are literally breathtaking in some scenes, especially those that combine western and Matrix style.<br/><br/>Overall, I loved it.<br/><br/>9/10"

","I'll follow suit of my good friend, and the star of Abe Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, and not fill your head with lies. This movie is tremendously enjoyable. AL:VH has a great sense of style, which is apparent in both the visuals and action sequences. A ton of hard work went into the craft of this twisted and cartoony early United States, and it shows. Along with the cool visuals is some fantastic action. Its highly stylized, axe-fu style scenes are terrific and choreographed to leave a smile on your face, and the finale is to die for. It's an excellent payoff to an otherwise ho-hum film. <br/><br/>There are two excellent action scenes here, while the rest feel like little teases to urge you towards the epic finale. The acting is also passable here. The script is mad cliché, but Mr. Walker plays an actually pretty good Lincoln, and some great moments flourish while others are laughable. Other side characters are actually pretty well done, but nothing Oscar worthy of course. What is mainly the problem here is the story telling. It's...well...non existent. The film basically hangs by a thread of ideas about racism and slavery, all of which are cleverly portrayed, and some revenge plot. <br/><br/>It's basic as basic can get, but that's not why you're going to go see this film. You're going to go see Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter because it's just that: our finest of presidents being a boss with an axe and chopping up vampires in the most stylish and fantastical of ways. It's fun, it's enjoyable, and it's much better than expected. From a film stand point, it's 3/5 stars, but from what I was hoping for, an action packed historical fiction with ridiculous scenarios and hyper-stylized action, and what I got...it's exactly what I asked for. Abe has his noticeable flaws, but this is a rough diamond of an action film that is sure to be in Blu ray players for a long time, and many times over. <br/><br/>Verdict: Yup, see it. 3 stars And a side note: 3D was excellent. Great sense of depth, but also tons of excellent effects created a truly unique experience, unlike most post production films."

The only compliment I am able to give is that the actors worked well with what they were provided. If you have no respect for good cinema, zombie movies and enter this movie with no expectations for the movie, you may find yourself mildly entertained. Otherwise you will find yourself sitting in the cinema writing up IMDb reviews to feel better about yourself for wasting the 20 something dollars you spent to sit and eat overpriced popcorn."

","What is there to say about ""Abraham Lincoln - vampire hunter?"" Its a dumb idea, and it makes for a dumb movie.<br/><br/>Oh be open minded I hear you say. Well I am. I went too see the film in the cinema didn't I? If it had just stuck too showing Lincoln as a younger man battling evil vampires then I could off maybe enjoyed it (These parts are the best parts off the film after all) but the trouble is it goes beyond that. Trenching right through Lincolns life, and attempting to link the most important off events in the life off the 16th president too a Van Helsing type character.<br/><br/>Now if this had been done as a comedy it could off worked (I was laughing at later bits either way) but its not even trying too be funny. The Flick desperately tries to be clever. Working its way around the life off this historical figure, with ideas that are no doubt going over most off the audiences heads.<br/><br/>What's left is an over the top mess with a so called plot which rushes through 50 years, yet still manages to drag. There's an obsession with slow motion, and tacky 3D (even though I saw it in 2D) and by the end I just felt kind off embarrassed that I'd just sat watching yet another vampire movie. Which thought it was being original because of the way it fitted itself around some forgotten history.<br/><br/>I've heard the book was rubbish and yet they still decided to make a movie out off it. Meaning the film is actually pretty damn offensive too. In more ways than one."

","About 30 minutes into the film, I realized that the use of Lincoln as the protagonist was really nothing more than a jokey gimmick designed to attract an audience to a Batman Begins movie set during the 1800s. Why else watch this movie except for the titillating idea of Abraham Lincoln perhaps having been involved in something from the occult? <br/><br/>If you're going to involve an important historical figure in your work, I'd think you'd try to marry the history to the activity--what is it about vampire hunting that suggests a different bit of insight about Lincoln? <br/><br/>Lincoln was a very formal man of his times. He certainly wouldn't have used the American language in the ways he does here. Nor do I see Lincoln as having the kinetic range of a Neo in Matrix. He was a tall man with a deliberate gait and not at all as animated as he's presented here. This is a character ""named"" Abraham Lincoln, not ""being"" Abraham Lincoln.<br/><br/>I was bored because I was watching a substandard super hero comic book kind of movie. All that research supposedly done to convey realism was a waste of time and effort. Someone should have researched language and customs. <br/><br/>I forced myself to stay through the train fight video game, then simply walked out on the film. I felt tricked into watching a bad movie that I wouldn't even pay a $1 for in the box."

And believe vampires exist. It was fast, funny at times, silly at times - even though it was played straight and they said they intended it to be played straight when I watched the making of the movie, gory - CGI gore, lots of action, lots of connections to the real Abraham and his friends and family and the civil war. I think his axe should have come from someone special though. That would have made his 'strength' with the axe slightly more believable. Maybe if the axe had come from the first vampire hunter and had the blood of a thousand vampires in the wood. So when you gripped it, it increased your adrenalin etc and made you fast and strong. Maybe the book had him training for 100 hours and that's how he got to be so skilled. Anyway, good show as long as your happy to watch it like you're watching Avengers, or Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, or some other show where people glide through the air and have the skill of a marksman and the agility of a trapeze artist."

Reluctant as I was to view the movie, I went nonetheless with an open mind. But being a historian, I was further skeptical of how one of the Finest Presidents this country ever had could be involved with Vampires. Still, I remained and watched with increasing fascination as the tale began amid the early frontier life of the 16th president of the U.S. It relates the saga of a centuries old Vampire who includes Lincolns' mother among his victims. Putting my prejudices aside, I sat with growing fascination as our hero is recruited to become a hunter of the undead. Through the length of the movie, I was mesmerized by the fantastic action sequences as well as the plethora of exciting scenes which involved a martial art, Axe-wielding chief executive against a plethora of blood drinking vampires. The cast is believable and includes Benjamin Walker and Lux Haney-Jardine as Abraham Lincoln with Dominic Cooper, Anthony Mackie and Elizabeth Winstead as Mary Todd Lincoln. In addition there are many special effects which combine to add credence to this modern but stylish horror story. In the end, I left the theater satisfied the film would rank above the ordinary and Worthy of the price of a ticket.

","I have to be honest...The idea first feel absurd to me.<br/><br/>Upon seeing the film however, i have to tip my hat to Timur for attempting something such as this. Imagine... taking a historical figure + setting and mashing it up with a concept so bizarre that it beggars belief.<br/><br/>Abraham Lincoln is indeed a figure well-respected in his home country for ending slavery. However, he also has slaves in his employ. This duality and conceit in his person is magnified even further in this movie. By transforming him into a vampire hunter, he is at once the savior of humanity while appearing more distant than ever from the issue of slavery. He only ends the trade because it suited his anti-vampire agenda. The fact that actions ended slavery is treated as just a by-product, rather than being the main issue.<br/><br/>As such, i implore you, dear reader! Visit your nearest film house and surrender your money. Not because this is a triumph of literature and movie-making. But instead, suppress your laugh at seeing an outrageous figure by treated outrageously. Sate your curiosity with the effects! Quench your expectation at the fumbling mannerism called acting.<br/><br/>This is an absurdist fare at its best. If you will join me in simulating approval with a cynical sneer.

"Hellmant","8","3","6","25 June 2012"," Awesome over the top action scenes directed by Bekmambetov in his usual creative style!
","'ABRAHAM LINCOLN: VAMPIRE HUNTER': Four Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>The popular 2010 mashup book by author Seth Grahame-Smith, who also wrote the 2009 zombie take on Jane Austin's classic book ('Pride and Prejudice and Zombies'), comes to the big screen! The film was directed by Russian director Timur Bekmambetov (who also directed the vampire films 'NIGHT WATCH' and 'DAY WATCH' as well as 'WANTED'), produced by Tim Burton and written by Grahame-Smith himself. It stars Dominic Cooper, Anthony Mackie, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Rufus Sewell, Jimmi Simpson and Benjamin Walker in the title role. The movie is a decent monster flick with some great action scenes but has almost no depth or emotion to offer. Visually it's stunning though (especially in 3D).<br/><br/>The film tells the story of America's 16th (and arguably most popular) President having a secret life as a vampire hunter. It begins with his childhood in 1818 when he befriended an African American boy named William Johnson. Abraham defends his friend from being beaten one day and gets his father Thomas (Joseph Mawle) in trouble with the plantation owner he works for named Jack Barts (Marton Csokas), who's also a vampire. Barts takes Abraham's mother's (Robin McLeavy) life one night in retaliation and Abe becomes obsessed with revenge. One night as a young adult man (after his father passes away) he attempts to take his revenge on Barts when he meets Henry Sturgess (Cooper) who informs him of the vampire world and trains him to be a vampire hunter. Abraham later learns of a vampire plot to take over the country and uses his powers as President to stop them.<br/><br/>The movie, like I said, has awesome over the top action scenes directed by Bekmambetov in his usual creative style. It's packed with CGI and is probably best viewed in 3D. The film is somewhat surprisingly serious (which a lot of critics have criticized it for) rather than taking a more fun and campy approach to the material. It's also said to have strayed quite a bit from the book but the author did write the screenplay himself and was greatly involved in the film's production. It's definitely his (and Bekmambetov's) vision so book fan's can't complain about someone else butchering the author's work. I found the film to be a bit slow in places and dry. I wasn't entirely impressed with the casting of Walker as Lincoln and think a better actor could have done a lot more with the role. Despite lacking much substance the film is still a lot of fun and the premise is so brilliant and entertaining that the filmmakers really couldn't go that wrong. I liked it; it's definitely not for everyone but fans of vampire movies and historical fiction might get a good kick out of it.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn0mEP_zzoQ"

","Everyone just needs to calm down and respect this movie for what it is. Frankly, I don't understand what people were expecting from a movie called Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter. You'd think it's an entertaining guilty pleasure sorta movie. But even my fairly high expectations were surpassed. What I thought would be a fun popcorn flick was actually a high octane, original and overall epic movie. The movie has great atmosphere and an especially awesome dismal colour scheme. The cast is quite impressive, like Benjamin Walker's Lincoln, while, of course we'll never really know how well he portrayed Lincoln, he seemed interested and dedicated to this roll. The vampire designs were awesome. I loved how their jaws grew to such large size and contorted to a whole different shape, reminiscent of Venom. It's good to see something different than just pale guys with fangs and red eyes. I thought the actions sequences were also well put together and quite inventive. For example, there's a chase between Lincoln and a vampire atop a herd of stampeding wild horses. I never thought I would see that. I've only heard complaints about this movie. A big one is that Abraham doesn't even kill vampires for half the movie, when he becomes president. That's quite the exaggeration. Try the last third of the movie he's president, plus he's supposed to be in his fifties. Were you really expecting him to be slaying vampires at an age when he could retire. And if that's not enough, he does kill vampires, in the film's finale. He has a higher body count than any other action sequence in the film, too. People should just calm down. No, it doesn't have the greatest story line or Oscar winning dialogue, but it did what it came to do: entertain. Stop oogling at the third batman movie, and watch an original movie for once, instead of simply shunning it away. Stick to your franchises for all I care, because I'm satisfied with this.

The film it has to be measured against is VAN HELSING, which had a special ingredient in the form of Hugh Jackman. Benjamin Walker displays none of Jackman's charisma, and even Rufus Sewell as the top vampire doesn't get to do much more than snarl and morph into a nightmare creature.<br/><br/>The CGI is top-notch and the fights are well-staged. The 3D jumps out at you, as it should, although I didn't like the muted colour palette - a lot of sepia and night-scenes.

This weekend they add yet another quality to their ever growing list starting the civil war. Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter has opened this weekend and just as the title has suggested, there is a load of cheesy ideas to fill this movie. Was this like most vampire cheesiness though or does Abraham Lincoln's tale stand out? Read on and decide for yourself as I give some insight into the movie. <br/><br/>Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, for those of you who haven't seen the trailers, is a story that starts out with death. A vampire by the name of Jack Barts (Marton Csokas) murders Lincoln's mother as he watches in fear. Nine years later, Lincoln (Benjamin Walker) attempts to avenge his mother by murdering the wise cracking vampire, only to fail his mission. However, a new ally named Henry Sturgess (Dominic Cooper) save Lincoln and trains him in the art of vampire slaying to prepare him for a bigger mission. That mission is to not eliminate one vampire, but a whole army that resides in the south who are planning to establish their empire one nation at a time. <br/><br/>Now let's face it although the trailers have made it look really cool, the idea of our 16th president being the newest Buffy is a little out there. Yes it is supposed to be a satire on a classic tale, but honestly why vampires and not something else. Despite the cheesy ideas though, the production team did a clever job integrating their imagination with historical events. The underground railroad, the silver mining operation, and the civil war were all modified to have an undead twist to help create a new story that was although cheesy entertaining to watch. However, like most movies these days, the team sometimes stretches their creative minds too far, which results in some annoying/stupid ideas that make you roll your eyes. The varying dialog doesn't help much as the most in depth comes from Lincoln's various speeches and addresses that can be found in any textbook or historical site. Sure a few of the jokes and one liners are funny, but it is due more to irony one sees with Lincoln saying them. <br/><br/>Perhaps the biggest strength of this movie is the action scenes, which for once has finally lived up to the trailers. Lincoln's moves are pretty sweet, and although it's hilarious and rather ridiculous to see the president hacking away, the moves are rather well shot. The various action scenes are diverse enough to keep the action fresh and fun, helping to give vampire slaying an edge that's been missing for quite some time. Lincoln uses his environment and hatchet to fulfill his hits, and most of the scenes are fast and exciting to bring one into the moment. Unfortunately for some, there is also some rather disturbing and graphic factors that I wish to warn you about. Those thinking of taking younger audience members may want to think twice as the countless close ups of vampires may have nightmare provoking faces and ear shattering screams that can scare you half silly. If you're one who gets sick from gore filled scenes then again avoid this movie as with nearly every swing follows a river of black blood. Yet another thing that seems to go hand in hand with action these days is the 300 technique of delayed motion. Like so many action scenes, Lincoln is filled with exaggerated swings and ducks that would put walking under water to shame. I can see two reasons for this overabundance of slow motion scenes. Number one is to help emphasize the finishing kills and help the audience feel the thrill of the final kill. The second reason, and perhaps the biggest reason, is many of the scenes were shot for 3-D. Whether it's throwing an axe, or a horizontal swing the movie has countless scenes to pop out of the audience, which in the 2-D version of the movie was lost on me. However, for those who love the technique, well drink up this movie and enjoy.<br/><br/>I guess the last thing to comment on is the acting, which was okay but nothing special. Walker does a decent job capturing both the younger and older versions of Lincoln, acting rogue enough to be a hormonal teenager, yet calm enough to be the authoritative figure. As for Cooper, well he did a decent job playing the hunter as he captured the drifter/ranger character well. However, he also had numerous other emotions down and when the time called for him to show those emotions he delivers. The rest of the cast is fine and play their parts well, but I don't have much room left to comment on their strengths, since the acting isn't the strongest part of this movie.<br/><br/>Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is an entertaining movie that is full of action and gore. Although the concept is rather ridiculous, it is worth a shot for any action lover or vampire movie watcher, though it is not a masterpiece. The clever integration of fiction into fact is worthy of applause, despite the rather predictable story. Perhaps the next time they do a movie like this though they find a better balance of using slow motion and perhaps even leave out the 3-D filming. The scores for the film are below: Action/Fantasy/Horror: 7.5 Movie Overall: 6.5"
"kuuk3","6","3","6","21 June 2012"," A fun film, but not without flaws
","It was good to see an original idea on the big screen. In a year full of sequels, prequels, remakes, reboots and even one film that was all the above, it was refreshing to see a film that didn't rely on a past film. <br/><br/>The first thing that got me was the low resolution camera. I don't usually even look at stuff like that, but when I see YouTube videos with more high definition clarity – I do wonder what on earth this film was shot on. Many of the shots were unfocused or simply lacked the clarity that I'm use to. Everything had been colour graded to make it look old and pastel like. I can hear some of you say its to give us the atmosphere of age – but there have been many films set in the past and they didn't need to 'age' the film to get us in the mood. When it's on the big screen, I really want to see each and every hair on the actors head shine through – you simply did not get that with this film. <br/><br/>They never even bothered to explain how these Vampires could walk around in sunlight. At one point they mentioned sun block but that got ridiculous pretty quick. The same goes for crucifixes, holy water, entering a person's home uninvited and all that stuff; it was all ignored. There were no stakes thrust through the heart and for some reason, a vampire shot in the head decides to keep the lodged bullet in himself for no reason other than why not. When he can turn to dust, you wonder why the bullet didn't just drop to the floor anyway. Vampires cannot kill each other, but you can hit them many, many times – and maybe accidentally kill them. When Adam thought there was silver in the box and tried to kill Henry on the train – how was he able to even attempt to kill him? It simply didn't make sense. <br/><br/>The acting was good and I was hooked throughout the film. The action was wicked and the camera kept focus on all that was happening without moving about too much which was good. There were lots of decapitations and yet they found as many different ways to kill a vampire in the same method which was interesting and stopped it from getting repetitive. <br/><br/>We were never informed about the main bad guys – who they were, where they came from, what their motives were or why there was a chain of command. They were simply there because the film needed a bad guy and a bunch of cannon fodder to get killed. <br/><br/>Mary was engaged at the start of the film to Stephen – yet started dating Abraham while still engaged with no opposition, and then got married. The story arch between her and Stephen I'm presuming was cut out in the edit room as it really made no sense why Stephen just vanished from the film. <br/><br/>There was a lot of politics, interwoven into a vampire story and at times it felt like you were watching two different films edited together. Maybe even three if the subplot between Stephen and Mary hadn't been cut out, and maybe even four if we learnt more about his rise to Presidency, which seemed to happen overnight. <br/><br/>Its worth watching, but I wanted more answers and explanations for some of the decisions that were made and it made a few artistic choices too many in my opinion – such as Vampires in sunlight – oh well, at least they didn't sparkle!"
"angelamillsaps325","1","6","16","23 June 2012"," This movie was insanely racist and should never have been created!!!
","I went to see this movie tonight with some friends and it was terrible.I was extremely disappointed with the way this movie turned out because they could have done so much more with this concept than they did. The entire thing was predictable which made the movie boring. You knew every time a vampire was going to show up and you knew every time some ""scary"" was going to happen. I left that theater feeling annoyed, insulted, bored and wanting my money back. I had really high hopes for this movie because the trailers made it look really awesome. But i guess thats usually how it works. I warn you, if you waste your money on this you will be very disappointed."
"atticus2132000","2","5","13","25 June 2012"," Either Read the Book or Watch the Movie...Not Both!!!
","I saw trailers for this movie and it intrigued me enough to buy and read the book. As subsequent trailers have been released I have been more and more excited about seeing it--so much so that I went to see it opening weekend. HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!!<br/><br/>I liked the book. It is not my favorite, but it was a fun read. For the book, the author did a really good job of researching Lincoln's life (yes, Wikipedia does count) and then ""filling in the holes"" with the fictional vampire story. While there were some obvious historical inaccuracies in the book (besides the vampires), for the most part, it was pretty historically accurate. The movie was such a huge departure from that philosophy that I found it supremely disappointing.<br/><br/>In short...if you haven't read the book, you might enjoy the movie for the fight scenes, but it really doesn't have anything else going for it. If you've read the book, skip the movie."
"cvs1988","1","17","63","20 June 2012"," Worst Movie of the Year
","There are movies that if they were human would be a strong argument for birth control; needless to say, this is one of those movies. This movie is nothing more than a $70million substitute for water-boarding. The dismal plot of the movie comes across as a cruel experiment by Hollywood to discover how poor of a script they can produce if they simply disguise it with an endless series of CGI action sequences and slow bullet time effects. I have seen Playstation games with less CGI than this movie displays. The bullet time effects are only appreciated because they provide longer relief from the banal acting than if they did the same scene in real time. The intended grotesque and gritty vampires come across as silly and comedic making Bella from Twilight comparatively seem frightening. The only mentally engaging aspect of this movie is trying to figure out how this movie was ever allowed to be made. Otherwise, my mind is more lifeless than the vampires from beginning to end. I went into the movie without having high expectations, yet I still left with an overwhelming feeling that I had just squandered two hours of my life with this abuse of my intelligence."
"jellyneckr","Null","3","7","31 October 2012"," Absolutely terrible
","Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter has one of the most absurd concepts of all time. The entire plot is goofy, dumb, and almost impossible to get behind. Yet somehow the novel managed to be an interesting if not entirely successful story that was way better than it could have been. It was also written very cinematically so it wasn't hard to imagine how a solid adaptation could have been produced. Unfortunately, the resulting film version is such a colossal mess that it's almost indescribable, mainly due some mind-bogglingly atrocious editing. The editing is amongst the worst I've ever seen in a studio production. Every scene is borderline incoherent as if the entire picture was cut together in a matter of days. I don't know if director Timur Bekmambetov had the right to final cut so I'll avoid placing blame on any one particular person. However, it would not surprise me at all if the director eventually reveals that the movie was released not completely finished. It's the only possible explanation for why everything is astonishingly sloppy. Each scene seems to be truncated to the shortest length possible, resulting in an extremely, extremely rushed pace. I doubt there are more than a few scenes that last more than a minute, making the entire film seem like one disjointed montage. Characters appear in scenes and disappear within seconds (this is especially true with Alan Tudyk's Stephen Douglas, who is probably on screen for 75 seconds at most). Even usually solid performers like Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Mary Todd Lincoln and Jimmi Simpson as Joshua Speed are reduced to probably less than ten minutes of screen time despite the fact that they are supposedly two of the most important characters in the story. Needless to say that because of the disastrous editing, there is not a single cast member that is able to leave much of any impression, including Benjamin Walker himself as Abe Lincoln. Unfortunately, the poor editing choices also sabotage the action sequences. Looking like the worst possible version of a Zach Snyder movie, each ""action"" scene is filled with non-stop slow motion/fast motion nonsense, too much emphasis on over-stylization, and more instances of horrible CGI than any movie in recent memory. All this renders the scenes completely ineffective with barely a moment of genuine excitement despite all the vampire-slaying on display. Those hoping for gore will be disappointed to know that despite being R-rated, there is hardly any blood and the blood that is visible looks less convincing and scary than cough syrup. Honestly, there isn't anything very positive that can be said about the flick. As an adaptation, it's unfaithful and lifeless. It also doesn't fit into a particular genre: it doesn't even try to be scary enough to count as a horror pic, it's too inert to be considered an action-adventure, and the tone is so humorless that in no way can it be considered a comedy. While Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is not the worst I've ever seen, it's certainly one of the very worst of 2012 and definitely not recommended. 2/10"
"ivegonemod","Null","3","7","1 July 2012"," Amazing in 3D!
","The only reason I wanted to see this movie is because I'm into 3D right now, and the 3D effects in one of my favorite movies, Titanic, were plenty lame. I usually avoid anything to do with slavery like the bubonic plague because it's too heavy and bothersome for me, but I went to see this anyway, and I am so thrilled that I did. I enjoyed this very much, especially in 3D, the effects were killer! I wasn't familiar with any of the cast, which is fine, because I don't care about such things. I thought the acting was on point. I was really pleased with the actors who played Abraham and Speed. I also was highly intrigued by the female vampire. Henry was an interesting character and had very much appeal. The head vampire guy had the creepiest eyes. I have to say that when Bejamin Walker was swinging that ax during the New Orleans plantation scenes, he was looking TO DIE FOR in that long overcoat. I think I could watch the movie again just for those scenes! Lots of action, good acting, good plot; obviously far-fetched but still a good plot. I wish that Speed didn't get killed though."
"melody23","10","3","7","24 June 2012"," One of the best films I've seen in many years
","You will have to bring your brain to enjoy this movie. It doesn't talk down to the audience. It doesn't cheat the audience. And anyone who thinks it's anything less than a work of art didn't see the movie I saw from my perspective. I detested Dark Shadows, the last film from this producer/writer duo, but if they spewed out that to get to this, they are forgiven.<br/><br/>Benjamin Walker is superb in this. He's as big as he needs to be to encompass the metaphor. As one might surmise, this isn't about vampires. It's not about the Civil War. It isn't even about Lincoln as much as it is about the moment in time he represents. In fact, the last few scenes clue us in that the director/writer believes the war is still going on, and I agree with them. <br/><br/>I simply adore this film. Yes, it's violent, but it's not as bloody as it might have been. It is also pitch perfect. If they had gone one degree more in any direction, this film might have been howlingly silly, but if you're bright enough to get what the director and writer are getting at, I think you'll love it. <br/><br/>Benjamin Walker is now one of my favorite actors, and I've only seen him in this The rest of the performances -- as well as the casting -- are first-rate, too. The only bad note is the really bad age makeup on Mary Todd Lincoln, but when a film is so good that you notice stuff like that, it's easy to forgive.<br/><br/>I can't recommend this film highly enough."
"deutschlars","3","3","7","24 June 2012"," Boring and looks like it has been shot on an iPhone 3
","This movies has a number of shortcomings, I would like to focus on one. The look.<br/><br/>There are movies that benefit from a digital look and then there are movies that were shot on digital and look OK. This movie does not fall in either category. It looks really bad. So much so that I was constantly aware of technical aspects of filmmaking. Luckily there is neither much story nor excitement that I could have missed. <br/><br/>It seems we are trapped in a close up of Mexican soap opera for most of the movie. Somebody must have thought that ""iMovie preset color-grading"" would help the film. Most of the film is so sepia or so blue that there is not much other color left. What really puzzles me is how this movie changes between ""super sepia"" and ""super blue"" in the same room at the same time for no dramatic reason. <br/><br/>For many years ""Hollywood movie"" was a guarantee for a great looking cinematic experience. Regardless of problems with story or script there was a look that made up for other shortcomings. Battleship (2012) is far from a great movie, but it is an example how great a modern Hollywood movie can look. <br/><br/>Unfortunately Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter is a low point of the cheap digital TV aesthetic. I hope this look does not become acceptable as this has nothing to do with a cinematic experience.<br/><br/>To sum it up: A movie called Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter that is neither fun, ironic, cool nor looks good is a wasted opportunity."
"jovat14","5","3","7","24 June 2012"," I'm going to really mad if this does better than Battleship or John Carter
","I always try and give movies the extra consideration for artistic contributions. Which is why I was surprised that John Carter and Battleship actually turned out to be duds. But this movie is really kind of a lemon. I mean, come on...vampires....and Abraham Lincoln. I'm sure the book was interesting and entertaining (as most books are always better than the movie). But it just seems that this movie is just trying to ride the coattails of this vampire craze gripping the country. The Twilight series as officially played this genre out for me.<br/><br/>I give the special effects a good nod (with the exception of Lincoln's 'aged"" look), but the overall plot is ridiculous at best.<br/><br/>Wait until this movie hits the dollar theater or the Red Box. Don't blow premium movie ticket and concession money on this dud. I'd rather wait for the sequel: ""George W Bush...Smart Person Hunter"""
"molly-turner64","6","3","7","23 June 2012"," if you have read the book, the movie is a disappointment
","If you haven't read the book,this is a trilling action movie! But if you have read the book...my opinion is that its best not to watch it. The movie barely went along w/ the book. They missed so many parts,so many IMPORTANT parts! They even slightly messed up Lincoln's real life...I read the book and I was so excited to watch such an exciting book come to life, but after watching it, I was quite disappointed! It was good as a MOVIE....but as a movie based on a book...not so much. So just make sure that if you have read the book already, don't get your hopes up too much, because the movie is kind of a pretty big disappointment. I cannot believe Seth Grahme-Smith let them leave out so much of the story.."
"d-cappella","8","3","7","22 June 2012"," A movie about monsters, perhaps more real than you might think
","This is an enjoyable alternate history movie which seems to me, more than anything else, to be a movie that you can walk away having learned something about fighting bloodthirsty monsters. The acting is done quite well, with Benjamin Walker playing a somber and surprisingly believable young president. I especially liked how Lincoln was portrayed as having an unstoppable work ethic and astonishingly strong convictions (both in terms of fighting vampires and more social evils such as slavery).<br/><br/>Watching the movie, I was struck by the sheer will and tenacity displayed in Lincoln to defeat what must have seemed to him to be an inexorable force that was bent on not only claiming his own identity for the worse (changing him to a vampire) but also society at large. I also thought that there was sufficient attention brought to the fact that vampires were not all irredeemably cruel, but that they could also display nobility. In a lot of ways this parallels each of our own struggles with the darkness within ourselves, our pride and selfishness. But ultimately this movie teaches that through faith and love and an indomitable courage and camaraderie, we can overcome. Perhaps, like Lincoln, we have a battle to fight, and the outcome will determine the nature of our very soul."
"ottoskorzeny-53649","4","2","4","3 March 2020"," Silly story
","For a movie that had decent acting and special effects, they couldn't think up a better story?
Just couldn't get over the title and story. Just couldn't image the 16th president slaying vampires in his free time.
Why not Donald Trump vampire slayer? Or better yet, hillary clinton, ""vampire"", or hillary clinton, ""lucifers sister""? That would be way more believable, and frightening."
"eched","1","2","4","9 April 2013"," it's as wonderfully bad as you think it is
","Oh boy, oh boy! Got this for free at the local library and it was well worth every penny. :) Yes, this is a movie with Lincoln running around with super human strength taking out vampires everywhere he goes with his trusty axe-gun! And yes, it is played 100% straight and the film makers seem to have no idea just how moronic this really is. As a result, this is a so bad it's awesome movie that is on par with such cheese fest as Jack Frost and Postal.<br/><br/>Oh my, where do I get started? Cons: 1. The action scenes are so over the top that it's insane. Specifically a stampede scene mid way through the film in which a vampire is tossing around horses as if they were rag dolls. Oh, you have to see this movie just for this scene.<br/><br/>2. Vampires can become invisible, but they sure do like becoming visible again to let Lincoln kill them. Actually, they never use this power in combat. They go out of site, pop back in site to let themselves be killed, and then wonder why they keep losing. Maybe if you actually stayed invisible, that would help. :) 3. As stated Lincoln has super strength but it only pops up once in the entire film and has no impact on the plot. It also of course makes no sense. Yahoo! The fact that his axe also happens to be a gun is just kind of there too.<br/><br/>4. Vampires can't harm each other for some reason...but yet at the end of the movie when the plot calls for it they can ignore that rule because for some reason...<br/><br/>5. The entire film just feels overly stylized in this very cartoon way. Think Batman and Robin only more CGI based.<br/><br/>The pros? Every bad thing comes together just right making this a moronic blast of a film. You'll laugh yourself silly at this train wreck.<br/><br/>Proper rating, 1 out of 10.<br/><br/>Rating based on how much fun you'll get out of it, 7 out of 10. :)"
"joshuawood2012","9","2","4","16 January 2013"," Strangely Entertaining
","I'm still not sure why I like this movie. I consider myself an intellectual person who genuinely enjoys history, yet somehow I hugely enjoyed this film about Abraham Lincoln killing vampires with an ax. Somehow, through either mistake or brilliant design, the makers of this film made this movie serious. It was not a goofy comedy with terrible CGI and terrible acting. Don't be mistaken though, this is a cheesy movie. Seriously, it has Abraham Lincoln butchering vampires, Confederates using vampires as soldiers, and the Underground Railroad transporting silver bullets for the war effort. How can you get this mix right? Then again, how can it go wrong?<br/><br/>It, thankfully, did not go wrong. This clever movie interweaves real history with supernatural bad guys. And these are no sparkly Twilight vampires, these are the true hunters of the night. It left the true history buffs in my viewer party both entertained and intrigued. Hopefully, if you are good at suspending reality for a while, it will entertain you too."
"thesar-2","2","2","4","6 January 2013"," No Lie: This Sucked
","I have been told it's not proper and even below this industry to call a movie ""stupid"" in one's review. But, damn, I will unapologetically call most of the scenes in Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter just plain stupid.<br/><br/>Granted, I am NOT a fan of CGI, or overused Matrix tricks without explanation. (I mean, reallywasn't the original Matrix almost 14 years ago?) In this mesh of realities, which I gave kudos to for being original in idea only, some of the axe-wielding scenes, especially involving horses, were so insanely comical and cartoonish, it was hard to even like this a little bit. It also didn't help having an incredibly bland Benjamin Walker play Mr. Lincoln. (Oh, and before you speak, I hadn't seen Daniel Day-Lewis's portrayal of the 16th President up to this point yet. So, I hadn't a recent version of Lincoln to compare this performance to.)<br/><br/>Walker was so bad, so boring, that when scenes weren't dripping with terrible dime store fake blood, he made the rest of the movie almost completely unbearable. Mercifully, when on screen, which wasn't that much, Dominic Cooper's Henry Sturges character, friend and mentor of Dishonest Abe, made up for some of the life that was sucked out by Walker.<br/><br/>(I'm going to love this one) When a vampire movie mimics the Twilight series, it's already headed towards trouble. Here, like that kiddie series that happily concluded last year, vampires can walk in sunshine. Apparently, they just taught themselves that talent. Abe's mommy is killed by one vamp and as in 100s of movie plots, he wanders with rage until directed to fight back by pal Henry. This includes, but isn't limited to, cutting down an entire tree with one stroke because one can imagine it as an enemy. Hmmm.<br/><br/>Eventually, Abe's conflicted with hunting vampires, killing the one who destroyed his mom, true love and I guess incidentally, being the President of the United States.<br/><br/>Obviously, the movie's not to be taken seriously, but c'mon. This movie was so poorly made, so bad, that even when a decent character or scene shows up, enough unforgivable stuff is still in your mind to dismiss the positive. Skip it and see the real-deal Lincoln movie of the year: Lincoln."
"PoisonKeyblade","3","2","4","5 January 2013"," Awful 3D and mediocre storyline leads to wasted potential
","As a movie, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is kind of a mess. There is no denying that there is some fun to be found here, especially if you're into the so-bad-it's-good genre. The cast is adequate and visually, it is quite striking. If you're looking for something any more substantial, I would suggest considerably lowering your expectations. I caught the midnight show.<br/><br/>If you know the title, you can pretty much figure out the plot. We follow Abe Lincoln on a life- long journey after discovering that the creature who killed his mother was indeed a vampire. Along the way, he meets the love of his life and a fellow hunter who shows him the ropes.<br/><br/>So right off the bat: I wasn't expecting an Award-winning film here. I mean, do you go into a movie called Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter and expect something extraordinary? Hell no. That said though, even with a premise as silly as this one you still have to find ways to make it work, ways to engage the audience beyond anything glimpsed here. For me personally, this movie just does not work when it needs to.<br/><br/>The casting isn't the problem; everyone is actually quite good including the big man himself, played by a dashing Benjamin Walker. I did have a big issue with the aging makeup, though not so much on Abe. Everyone around him is supposed to get older as the time passes, and yet no one looks to be aged within ten years of Abe. I can understand some minor discrepancies, but seriously? The makeup on Mary Elizabeth Winstead made her look about five years older. The visual look of the film also isn't the problem, even though the special effects are overly shoddy at times and can pull you right out of the movie. Overseen by Tim Burton, the cinematography looks great even when the special effects don't. The action scenes usually fall pretty flat for the most part and didn't really impress me much. The whole section where Abe hunts down his mother's killer made me practically keel over from laughter, it was so preposterous. <br/><br/>For me, the biggest problem lies in the script which relies quite a bit too much on the historical side of things without doing anything to really flesh out the characters. It also takes itself much, much too seriously for the movie's own good. Some dialogue and even entire situations don't make the slightest bit of sense. For instance, (minor spoiler here) it is established early on that one vampire cannot harm another vampire. So why, in one specific instance, does the very opposite of this established rule occur? There is no given explanation. There are all sorts of little plot holes, issues with the mythology, and logical impossibilities that definitely bothered me (how was Abe's hat able to hold the entire body weight of Mary without capsizing?), but there was quite a lot that I was willing to let slide.<br/><br/>The positives: An energetic Dominic Cooper. Benjamin Walker completely immerses himself in the role of Abe and is believable even when the situations aren't. The visually pleasing look of the film. Lots to laugh at, even when it's unintentional. The look of the vampires. The comical overuse of slow-motion. <br/><br/>Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter isn't your typical vampire movie and it certainly doesn't establish any of the mythology to an understandable extent. However, I laughed a lot. It was a fun throwaway movie and certainly could have been much worse. Hilarity ensues from the second the movie begins. If you're looking forward to this flick, I would wait to check it out on DVD. The 3D was absolutely terrible and there was nothing that popped out at all, unless you count a few specks of dust. / Rating: D+"
"keith-w8888","2","2","4","31 December 2012"," bizarre concept but what the heck....
","The attraction of Vampire (and zombie) movies to the movie maker is that they legitimise as much wanton bloodletting and gore as can be served up inside of 120 minutes. 'Body count' movies became politically unacceptable after 9.11 and this became the favoured Hollywood solution. On that score this movie will not disappoint. The extreme violence and CGI blood spatter will not disappoint those with the appetite for gore. A cast of complete unknowns must have been necessitated by the refusal of any known actor, however minor, to participate in such a mess of blood and guts and the greatest disservice imaginable to one of America's greatest presidents. They are all well cast and acquit themselves with whatever dignity is available to such bottom feeders. The ultimate irony would be if every other (historically accurate) record of Abraham Lincoln got lost in the mists of time except this movie and 2,000 years from now our ancestors believed that the American Civil War eradicated not just legalised slavery but also vampires. That would be funny and make it altogether worthwhile."

","I have to say, when I saw this movie advertise I though to my self 'oh god! they have gone way to far, that's got to be the dumbest thing ever!' when the movie came out on DVD, my friend rented it and told me just to watch it. I watched it thinking it was going to leave me walking away shaking my head, but to my surprise it was a really OUTSTANDING movie! The story line was interesting and new, the effects were good, script was very well written (in my opinion), the actors did a fantastic job, and the actors also look the parts as well. the only thing that I can really complain about is in some of the scenes its like scenes that should have been in were cut out. That is my only complaint though, everything else in the movie was really good! Over all if your looking for a movie that is really interesting, that you want to watch over and over again...... then RENT, or BUY!!

","So I just finished watching this movie and I have to say that I liked it! No, its wasn't the visual, factual Abe Lincoln, but who cares! Alright, I guess if you are a history buff and WANT actual events, then you are better off watching ""Lincoln"" which I heard was pretty good as well.<br/><br/>So, based on events when he was a child, Abe becomes a vampire hunter and a pretty darn good one a that and, based on past friendships, he becomes the man we all know and love today (equality makes anyone a friend in my book). Rufus Sewell plays the villain well (love him in most of his roles since Dark City) and Benjamin Walker wasn't bad (loved the ax-welding bit!) either. Supporting cast also did a good job.<br/><br/>On a whole the movie was good as long as you like action, Rufus, and vampires (raises hand right here :D), not so much if you like history (drops hand).<br/><br/>Cheers!!"
"The-Sarkologist","9","2","4","15 December 2012"," I'll Never be able to look at Abraham Lincoln the same again
","As somebody said in a review, Steven Speilburg is going to have to do a pretty good job to be able to beat this movie, and in fact now that I have actually seen this movie, I am really not interested in the other movie that has been released about Lincoln. In a way, when Hollywood seems to want to make a movie such a Lincoln, two movie houses seem to try to beat the other in trying to make the better movie, however I have never seen an instance where one movie house makes a serious movie about a famous figure, and another movie house turns the same figure into a vampire hunter. Maybe they should do the same with Kennedy, or Nixon.<br/><br/>Anyway, the story begins with Lincoln at the age of nine when he rescues a young black friend of his from being whipped, and his parents rush in to protect him. However, the antagonist turns out to be a vampire and kills his mother that night, but Lincoln only discovers this when, at a much older age, decides to get his vengeance only to find himself being beaten to a pulp. Mind you, he is then rescued, and trained to hunt vampires.<br/><br/>As it turns out there is more to slavery in the south than a bunch of wealthy landowners wanting to utilise cheap labour. They are actually vampires and they have established themselves in the south and are using the Negro population as food for themselves. Realising that he requires much more clout than his axe (and having Lincoln swinging a vampire slaying axe is heaps cool), he decides to run for president and marshal the forces of the American army against this vampire menace.<br/><br/>This isn't a movie about Lincoln before he was president, in fact it is a movie of a much grander scope than that, turning his entire life into a war against the undead. Also, while this movie is quite cheesy in many ways, it seems that a lot of money was spent on it to make it visually impressive (and I notice that Tim Burton had his hand in its creation as well). In the end, I'm never going to be able to look at Abraham Lincoln the same again."

","Abraham Lincoln as a child saw his mother killed by a man she stood up to. <br/><br/>Abe would find the man and try to kill him, but for some reason he doesn't die. He tries to kill Abe but a man saves him and nurses Him. <br/><br/>When Abe awakens, the man, Henry Sturges, tells him that the man he was trying to kill is a vampire. Abe wants to learn how to kill them and Henry teaches him and makes him an axe lined with silver, which is the weapon Abe prefers. <br/><br/>Eventually Abe slays the vampire who killed his mother but before dying he tells Abe that Henry has not been honest with him. He confronts Henry, who doesn't deny it....<br/><br/>It's another case of great title, average film as we follow Abe, trying to do a night watch on some Gettysburg undead.<br/><br/>It's a case of deja vu when watching this. At least two of the characters are trying to look like Downeys Sherlock Holmes, and every time we see Abe, I just think of Liam Neeson.<br/><br/>Action scenes are okay, but we've all seen it before, and Sewell steals the show as Adam, the atypical English villain.<br/><br/>Sewell is the cut price Alan Rickman, and it's probable he will continue to do these sort of non challenging roles.<br/><br/>It's not a bad film, it just happens, and finishes.<br/><br/>I'll wait for Tony Blair: Zombie Slayer...."

Anyways, I still don't get it as to why Abraham Lincoln's character was used here. Tired of Googling though, haven't also read the book yet...

"Tcarts76","8","2","4","27 October 2012"," Entertaining and fun
","I thought I was going to hate this movie but I was wrong. Turns out it was a fun and entertaining movie to watch. It doesn't take itself to seriously and is much better than sitting around watching a boring ""Twilight"" vampire depression fest.<br/><br/>The story is about a boy Abraham Lincoln, who witness the murder of his mother by a vampire. A Young Lincoln, now older, plots his revenge and in a drunk failed attempt is rescued by Henry Sturges(Dominic Cooper). Henry makes a pact to teach Lincoln to kill vampires, but only those that Henry tells him to, and eventually he will get his chance to reap revenge. Lincoln(Benjamin Walker) grows older, gets married, and studies to be a lawyer, to find that Vampires are on the side of the Confederates and he vows to save humanity from their grasp.<br/><br/>The action and acting is over the top but in a good way. The sets, editing, and script have a fun appeal and feels sort of like a comic book story which makes it not so serious but very entertaining. This movie was made to be fun, and it accomplishes that.<br/><br/>The only thing that scares me about this movie is that our education system is so bad that I would hate to think these kids would grow up and the only thing they may know about Lincoln is that he was a Vampire Hunter. So enjoy the movie, have fun watching it, but don't let your kids think it is fact ;)...It's an 8 for me."
"beanieboy32","9","2","4","26 October 2012"," Surprisingly Good
","Went into this not expecting much from it but from the start was given a full on vampire action/thriller. The film could have been set over a couple of days and been a standard action film but setting it over a lifetime gave the picture much more depth by displaying youth and arrogance and then watching lincoln grow older and wiser made the film as good as it is. The supporting characters were good if lacking background. The plot was explained well with few flaws. What really surprised me was simply how it looked. It looks absolutely epic(mainly the scene where he cuts the tree down), the train scene was particularly well done showing drama and action in the same scene. Truly one of the best films of the year."
"Robert_duder","8","2","4","21 October 2012"," Perhaps one of the most stylish films ever made, lacking some depth
","I really wanted to see Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter in theaters but I missed it so I was really looking forward to seeing it on DVD. I'm certainly glad I got to see it but I wish even more I had seen it on the big screen. The film is visually spectacular, brilliantly visual, just stunning and well done special effects and a unique flare that you will not forget. That being said...dazzling visuals and style does not make a great movie. The story leaves a lot wide open that you feel is sort of empty filler. I'm not sure they really delved into the idea that THEE famous President Lincoln was a vampire hunter. Sometimes it felt like this guy could be anyone rather than a famous historical figure. There was so much content to this movie that I think it was almost too ambitious to cram into one film. The idea of sequels doesn't work because we all know how Lincoln's life ends so they do try to work everything they can into it. Still despite a slightly less than impressive story the film stuns you with its fight scenes, gadgets and death scenes. A dizzying array of gritty, Gothic and gory fun.<br/><br/>Benjamin Walker carries this film very well. I think you'll see him pop up as the lead in many more films like this one. His on screen charisma is decent and he pulls off the role with ease. I was slightly under-impressed by the makeup job that they did for him when he was older Abe Lincoln but that isn't his fault. I just thought for how visually stunning the film was, the makeup was poor on him. Dominic Cooper plays a good role that I think is a little underused in the film. Still he is a good mentor for Lincoln and has a good mysterious past that is used well. Rufus Sewell makes a good solid villain. Now an amazing villain, but not for lack of his performance. The main villain I think is underwritten but Sewell does his very best with what he is given. Supporting cast, especially Anthony Mackie, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Jimmi Simpson do a good job in their perspective roles. There are no issues at all with anyone's performance, everyone does a great job. The issue is that the characters are not written with enough depth. Everyone is so good and the characters seem so interesting that its disappointing to see them underused.<br/><br/>Perhaps this would have made a better big budget TV Series so they could really explore the characters. I don't think they could have gotten a better director though in Timur Bekmambetov. His vision is literally breathtaking and he takes a 6/10 script and turns it into an 8/10 movie. Its well worth seeing and a great comic adaptation visually but the story will leave you wondering what more there could have been. Still a good solid action flick. 8/10"

"crownofsprats","7","2","4","16 October 2012"," A cut above the rest!
","I was introduced to Honest Abe's secret vampire-slaying days by a stoned Chipotle employee who claimed he was savvy to ""this great history book about a truth that has been hidden from the public"", etc. When I got home to figure out what lunatic revisionist nonsense actually made this guy open a book, I realized the poor sod got fooled by a novel - which, of course, made it all the more hilarious. Weeks later, the trailer to the film adaptation came out. True story!<br/><br/>The main question you should be asking yourselves here is: does the movie work? Because with a title like ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"", how much can you possibly be hoping for?<br/><br/>What you should be hoping for above all is a good time, and Bekmambetov delivers like a pro. The title pretty much tells you the entire story of the movie, so I am not gonna waste time pointlessly discussing secondaries like plot and characters. Suffice it to say that it was well (enough) acted, and apart from a few tedious minutes of dialogue in the later portion, the pacing and plot took you down their merry course with nary a hiccup. As a matter of fact, it seemed like everyone on the production crew did a top-rate job.<br/><br/>The action certainly deserves a mention, since it's the driving force behind this movie. Abe was ""good at splittin' rails"" back in the day (and not too great at shooting), so his vampire-slaying weapon of choice is an axe. He is taught to wield it in a Tedious Temple Training montage that's part hokey 19th century Americana and part Herculean feats of CGI Axe Fu. From that point on, the action sequences are as brutal and fast-paced as any R-rated big-budget production, yet still refreshing and original enough to clench your fists and put a satisfied grimace on your face. And as with pretty much every post-millennial big budget action movie, the CGI always elevates everything a notch or two towards the precarious heights of absurdity - which usually harms a film, but we're talking Abe Lincoln here, so no reason not to throw in stuff like a Matrix-style chase on top of stampeding horses!<br/><br/>It's this conversion of Americana into absurdity - first by a mashup novelist, then by a Russian-Kazakh director for whom the breadth of American pop-lore is just an amusing artifact to dissect and incorporate into his visual palette - that really made the movie work for me. The aforementioned horse stampede scene (sans vampires and Lincoln) could have easily come out of any Marlboro Man commercial, back when they were still allowed to make those for TV. Nothing is ever really taken seriously here, except the quality of the finished product. And in this crew's hands, that makes Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter way more entertaining than most recent mainstream vampire flicks, and - let's be honest with ourselves here - most of the big modern big-budget Hollywood extravaganzas, which are usually some sort of comic book adaptation or another, since none of the greedy Hollywood rats can grow a pair big enough to take a chance and sink money into anything that isn't an already-established franchise in one or more media formats.<br/><br/>So if the title sounds like something you'd be into, you should definitely check this out. This definitely gets my ""feel-good movie of the year"" vote."

"BharatSamra","7","2","4","10 July 2012"," Man prefers history to legends
","Many have conceived the combination of biographical drama with the very contemporary and perhaps oxymoronic fantasy genre as the pitfall in this picture. Ironically, this review will probably be an oxymoron to one above or below it terms of its disagreement with this opinion. This unique blend has great substance to feel as if the hybrid film is almost necessary to engage a modern audience to appreciate the life of the 16th US president, as if he could be more valued.<br/><br/>Timur Bekmambetov's piece successfully delivers exactly what the title suggests. We recollect many details in the life of the one of the greatest US presidents, paralleling with the use of literal and allegorical vicious vampire figures to represent the 19th century confederacy. Lincoln's battle against this commences as a quest for retribution, only to evolve into something much bigger than himself; the retaining of core American values.<br/><br/>I find this film to be a masterpiece in some respects. Most notably the editing by William Hoy, whose transitions provide us with quite sensational storytelling, further assisted with an adequate script and admirable performances from a highly respectable cast. Unfortunately however, the telling of the president's two pursuits, overlap as his fight for the abolishment of slavery begins. It appears less emphasised that feels necessary and is more so casually added to the narrative as salt is added to pasta, we know it should be there but head chef Bekmambetov has thrown it in without realising its significance. Nonetheless, the motion picture remains a great spectacle throughout, only until plot holes and moments of..well silliness begin to unfold towards the climax of the feature. Feeling the need to make a face of brief disappointment where I roll my head and say to myself ""really?"" over the ridiculous and inconceivable mistakes made in production, I remain engaged to see how, what is foremost an enjoyable film, will conclude itself.<br/><br/>As we conclude (both review and film), we return to the narration witnessed during the establishing shot, a technique that contains structure. ""History prefers legends to men"". While film history will not note this collaboration of genres as legendary, it does metaphorically tell a fictional interpretation of the life a legendary man."
"feixiang-films","6","2","4","7 July 2012"," ""Abraham Lincoln - Vampire Hunter"" (2012) - LIKED Rating
","Pros: Artistic interpretation of one of America's most colorful time periods/events, rich historical context, strong story/character and plot development, well-balanced genre distribution, fun & creative action choreography/scenes, beautiful cinematography, and genuine love for our dear President Abraham Lincoln. The story was touching - the raw intensity of humanity, human faith, and what it means to be a friend, to be free, to live, to die it brings out emotions. Also, they did a great job of making Benjamin Walker look like Abraham Lincoln!<br/><br/>Cons: Not the best story background for the vampires. Although that also builds onto one of the film's good qualities, I would have also enjoyed a bit more vampire dirty secrets :). Also not a detrimental flaw, but there is not a great deal of eye-candy. But then again, it is a presidential film...<br/><br/>This movie wins points to the heart and reveals its hidden potential. It had a difficult time with marketing, an unfair, disadvantage. Perhaps it was an inadequate preview – the trailer consisted of action scenes and moments emphasizing vampire slaughters, deemphasizing its qualities as a historical piece. Viewers also laughed at the absurdity and maybe disrespectful play of even considering a treasured U.S President with vampires. Whatever the reason, a good population of the viewers tossed this film aside, choosing to focus on the upcoming Spiderman or other big names. Too bad. If given a chance, this film pleasantly surprises with an artistic interpretation of one of America's most colorful time periods/events, rich historical context, strong story/character and plot development, well-balanced genre distribution, fun & creative action choreography/scenes, beautiful cinematography, and genuine love for our dear President Abraham Lincoln. I fully enjoyed the film and from the commentary afterwards, so did many viewers.<br/><br/>The film's interpretation of the slavery abolition period is fully developed and adequately supported, convincing viewers that the whole notion almost could be possible. If there was going to be a vampire era in the United States. It would be the 1800s. If there was going to be a vampire hunter, Mr. Lincoln would have been one.<br/><br/>Though the film portrayed itself as a pure vampire flick, the detail in historical references and de-emphasis of vampires makes it much more (there isn't a scene that allows a careful study of the vampire design, which from quick glances looks like a 'Supernatural' multi-fanged/'Van Helsing' demonic/ and Trueblood creation, and the vampires' backgrounds are not fully explained). ***SPOILER*** In fact, Abraham Lincoln's prime time as a vampire hunter was very short, limited to a few scenes in his youth, while the path to him becoming a vampire hunter and his later career as a lawyer, politician, and president got more devotion. Slavery, North and South's relationship, the war, and even the under- ground railroad play key roles in this story's development.***END OF SPOILER*** The story was touching - the raw intensity of humanity, human faith, and what it means to be a friend, to be free, to live, to die brings out emotions.<br/><br/>Although Abraham Lincoln is put in a fictional scenario, the film puts out quite a bit of his ""true life"". Some viewers unfamiliar with our 16th President's background may get a bit of an education, like how Abraham Lincoln was indeed an ""axeman"" in his youth. Other characters are also introduced and developed to a satisfying degree, and romance is kept to a minimal. This film is a great blend of adventure, action, suspense, comedy, and feminine heroism!<br/><br/>The cinematography and choreography are also not to be left out when awarding compliments. Possessing a lovely 'Gone with the Wind' feel, the soft lighting and tones enchant viewers to the charms of romanticism. The action scenes are also not lacking in comparison to 'Bond' films or our favorite sci-fis.<br/><br/>All in all, the film greatly celebrated Abraham Lincoln, the abolition of slavery, and our obsession for vampires ;). It was a great film – if you enjoy adventure/action/sci-fi/vampires/history and/or are a Tim Burton fan, you should go watch this!"
"genefog","Null","2","4","4 July 2012"," Very niiiiice
","I doubt i'm going to spoil anything, but just in case, there's the check. I really enjoyed the movie and saw it twice, will definitely get a copy. First, they did a great job on the makeup, and the gal who played Mrs. L was as gorgeous as they get. The vampires appeared powerful and the affects of speed, invisibility and other qualities were great although II really would prefer movie makers stuck with the idea that vampires remain in darkness.<br/><br/>The battle scenes were very well done, much better than some I've seen in the past in other movies. There were some affects that were a bit far fetched, but as a rule, the movie was well made and entertaining. My family has historical ties to Abe so I remembered that as I watched, but it was a very good movie nonetheless, and personally I saw not much I'd do different. As one with black powder experience though, it cracked me up when Abe as a young man fired the pistol and I could clearly hear the powder slow burn in the tube as do blank rounds, but very few people would notice that. Overall, very good movie and I'm glad to see they did not insult Lincoln's memory by making him a shitty character like they did in Blood Bloody Andrew Jackson and the utter atrocity of Dog Meets God."
"xatian11968","7","2","4","2 July 2012"," Artistic license that entertains
","This was an entertaining movie (haven't read the book), I'd give it a 5 for effort. Two more points for CGI. So 7. There were moments where you cringed at the historical presumption and various inaccuracies, and I laughed at the candles that didn't flicker; and sometimes Walker's close up made you want to strangle him for his Abe portrayal (see it in 3D). Sure I'd watch it maybe once more, for the really artistically mindful CGI, costuming and set dressing. The opening storybook deconstruction of the District of Columbia really made your eye wander if you know the layout of that city; and the White House sets brought to comfy life many scenes in 1860s Washington that are otherwise historically black and white ((less the errors in some of the south facing outdoor sequences with the monument) (that blue and white blanket on the bed! Where can I get one?)).<br/><br/>This of course all comes after I divorced myself from the ethics of using the Civil War era with slavery based on some large stereotypes. The assumption of Mackie's character was a novel one none-the-less. At least Cruise's Lestat had the decency to keep history as a side story, and not turn the back story of the 16th president into make-believe. Regardless of the latter, yes, two thumbs up as something to do. Cooper is very stylish, as well as Winstead (who knew Mary Todd could look that warm), in costuming that even you might consider wearing in modern 1860s. Frutiger, Carasik, Avdyushko & Poggioli did a good a job. And all around, if you like vampires and got nothing better to do with 15 bucks to burn, sure, it's a fun interpretation that a President is a vampire slayer named Abraham. Be warned this is not historical fiction; this is a vampire slasher story with a man named Lincoln who acts and looks like someone else we know who also lived in a cabin outside Springfield, Illinois."

","""History prefers legends to men. However history remembers me before I was a President, it shall only remember a fraction of the truth.""

Young Lincoln sees this and begins his quest for vengeance. Ten years later he sees the man who murdered his mother and sees his chance, but it doesn't turn out like he planned. A man named Henry Sturgess (Cooper) begins to train Lincoln so he can complete his revenge. I have to say that I am a huge sucker for cheesy Sci-Fi movies. I love movies like ""Piranha"" and ""Mega-shark vs. Giant Octopus"". Something about those movies are just fun to me. I bring that up because that's what I was expecting from this movie. I couldn't have been more wrong. While it was a little over the top in some parts, this movie was more of a straight horror movie instead of going for the cheesiness I was thinking. That made the movie even better then I expected. I have never really been a big vampire movie guy but this one was great and may be my favorite vampire movie of all time. This ain't your girlfriend's vampires. This is more like ""Underworld"" on speed and more gore. Very very fun movie and you will never think of the Civil War the same way again.

","Despite the silly premise I went looking for popcorn fun. Sadly, the movie delivers very little of that but plenty of what most expect and that's a story that's dumber than dirt. This effort really is as bad as Wild Wild West but with less star power. In fact, the entire final train battle scene was so far over the top and so very cartoonish and silly that it actually falls BELOW Wild Wild West levels. Up until that point, the action was quite light and that was a surprise. Take out one scene where young Abe chases a vampire through a stampede complete with CGI horses being thrown around and I can't recall any other interesting action at all. Everything is cheesy bad but very little of it in a good way. This was truly one of the worst films that I've experienced this year.<br/><br/>(BTW- Abe gaining vampire-like super strength because truth is power did make me snicker out loud. That was worth a few ratings points right there!)"
"Boba_Fett1138","7","2","4","26 June 2012"," Not as ridicules as it might sound and not as bad as you might fear.
","Forget the premise. It sounds ridicules for just about everyone. Just see this as a period action piece, with some vampire fun thrown into it.<br/><br/>And really, the movie is not as silly and ridicules as you might think. It's not a movie made for laughs necessarily but it's more being a straightforward genre flick, that is trying to be good and entertaining not necessarily just through its main, gimmicky sounding, concept. And it works as such. It's not being a great movie by any means but it at least is being entertaining and maintaining to watch, from about start till finish.<br/><br/>And how many period action movies are out there anyway? The movie deserves some credit for that alone already. And the time period and settings work out well for most part. It's interesting to see vampires and 'mondern' looking type of action taking place during the 19th century. It provides the movie with some pretty unique and often also awesome and thrilling looking moments.<br/><br/>It's definitely true that the movie gets uplifted by the look of it. It has a great visual style to it and the movie truly got skillfully directed by Timur Bekmambetov, who is accustomed to brining visually striking movies to the screen and combining it with some good action and often fine storytelling as well.<br/><br/>The story of the movie is still lacking though. And no, I'm of course not talking about it being ridicules but it steps over a couple of things far too easily and the overall movie feels to me as if it wanted or needed to cover too much ground. There perhaps was enough material in its story for 2 more movies but this movie wanted to do all of it and wrap up everything by the end of it. You could say that the movie its pace feels too fast, which also prevents the movie from ever making any emotional impact on a more dramatic level, or to feel involved with any of its characters. But that's just not this movie. It never really slows down and jumps into its action pretty much right away.<br/><br/>So as a simple, fun, action flick this movie does not disappoint but also the vampire lovers shall most likely not end up feeling disappointed with this movie. It takes a somewhat original take on vampire, in which the vampires get portrayed as true monsters and they get to do plenty of sucking, fighting and killing in this movie.<br/><br/>This is simply and good and fun enough movie to watch, as long as you can take its premise of course.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","I'm all for titles that spawn preposterous reactions and incredulity among the public, but Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter's begs ""notice me."" It is so strangely concocted, with a noun and an adjective strung together with little to no connection, that it demands you see it. The film takes one man's bestselling novel and gives it the seventy million dollar+ Hollywood treatment, and by the end, it doesn't walk out entirely gutted, but with some limbs missing.<br/><br/>That's right, this was a novel, but I'm sure that fact is seldom known by the public. After weeks of seeing the trailer in theaters, for many different films, reactions were always different, yet there was always spry laughs coming from some audience members. A friend of mine stated, ""I doubt that was what the director was going for."" I disagree, as it brings me back to the incredulity part I was talking about. The idea is so strange, so cockamamie, and sounds so hilarious that while you're laughing, you're hiding the fact you want to see the film. An intelligent marketing plan if you ask me, but execution beats marketing intelligence.<br/><br/>Benjamin Walker, who looks impeccably like a young Liam Neeson, jumps into the shoes and suit of our sixteenth president, and is holding a monumental grudge against Jack Barts (Marton Csokas), the man who poisoned his mother. When Barts informs Lincoln he is an immortal vampire, the bearded man is taken under the wing of Henry Sturgess (Dominic Cooper), who tells him that he can teach him to become a skilled vampire hunter. Along the way, the man reconnects with an old African American boy he grew up with and Mary Todd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), the women who would eventually become his wife.<br/><br/>Director Timur Bekmambetov has taken the Tim Burton approach (who unsurprisingly has a credit on this picture) to the film and has given a dark and eerie look to it. Seeing it in 2D, I can't imagine how dingy and foggy the picture must've looked in the third dimension, what with the muted colors that are already muted and the loss of brightness when there is almost none to be lost. The cinematography, and of course, Benjamin Walker's brave performance as an ax wielding Lincoln, are the two things the film can offer before the premise begins to catch up with us.<br/><br/>This is a film that was better an idea, or possibly a novel, than a one hundred and five minute picture. To begin with, it has an immensely pompous attitude towards this ""vampire"" premise, when really, its goal should be to achieve campiness and not a long-lasting impact on people. Brief escapism if you will. The whole picture neglects to recognize its absurd, revisionist ideas and treats the film as a masculine period piece established on modest obscurity. The film isn't modestly obscure but fully obscure, and it's unclear whether Seth Grahame-Smith (the writer of the film and the novel) wants us to laugh at it, although he makes very little attempt at black humor, a feat that would've been welcomed with open arms by myself, or if he wants us to sincerely care about it.<br/><br/>There is a scene early on where Barts and Lincoln are fighting in a field, where CGI horses are racing pasts at stunning speeds. They are dodging, weaving, and carefully slipping under the horses' bodies for a good three or four minutes before Barts picks up a full horse and throws it at Lincoln like it's nothing. The film needed more ridiculous scenes like this, rather than monotonous action set pieces. The final sequence, involving a speeding train on a burning bridge, works great, yet, still occupies that unnecessary level of indulgence.<br/><br/>As far as an impact on the audience, it seems the only thing Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter will succeed at is having a legion of internet users creating immature, mildly amusing, childlike SNL title/video parodies featuring other famed political icons. As a film itself, it is a cute idea, blown up on the big screen in a strangely pretentious way. Audiences are likely to appreciate the absurdity of it all, but if not, there's always the cult following business...<br/><br/>Starring: Benjamin Walker, Dominic Cooper, Anthony Mackie, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Rufus Sewell, and Marton Csokas. Directed by: Timur Bekmambetov."

","Based on the novel by Seth Grahame Smith, Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter capitalizes on the recent Vampire craze launched by Twilight and True Blood by turning the Civil War into a battle between vampires and humans (guess who is on the South's side?). When Abraham Lincoln witnesses his mother's murder, he swears to get his revenge. Little does he know that the murderer is in fact a vampire. With the aid of an enigmatic trainer, Lincoln dedicates his life to vanquishing Vampires, which leads to the dissolution of the Union.<br/><br/>I think people need to loosen up about this movie. Yes, the concept is absurd. But why is that bad? The movie is an entertaining action romp and it should be taken as such. Benjamin Walker is an endearing Abraham Lincoln and the vampires are all very entertaining, especially Martin Csokas. The supporting cast members are all fun as well. The action scenes, while not the best I've seen, are still exciting enough to keep you in a state of suspense. The final big action scene of the movie is the highlight of the film. <br/><br/>The movie is not above criticism of course. The 3d does absolutely nothing and I think the film felt rushed. It would have benefited if it was about twenty minutes longer. While it might seem ridiculous to criticize a film like this for historical inaccuracies, one thing really irked me. Abraham Lincoln's friendship (if friendship is even the right word) with William Johnson did not go back as far as childhood. The earliest records of William Johnson's relationship with Lincoln are from 1860. I think they embellished this relationship to portray Lincoln as a racial egalitarian from birth, an interpretation that I have always been highly skeptical of. <br/><br/>Basically, if you let your mind go, you will have fun with this movie. See it in a regular theater if you can though."

","The first half of ABRAHAM LINCOLN: VAMPIRE HUNTER works the best. Perhaps because there's more leeway to historical events concerning the life of who many regard as America's greatest President. And there's more butt kicking.<br/><br/>According to this story, based on a popular graphic novel, a young Lincoln lost his parents to a bloodthirsty vampire and grew up seeking revenge. In his twenties, our spirited yet naïve hero finds a teacher in Dominic Cooper's maverick vamp slayer Henry who, a cross between Van Helsing and James Cagney, teaches Abe how to really swing an axe.<br/><br/>Lincoln, played with lanky gusto by Benjamin Walker, has only one bloodsucker on his list – but Henry makes sure his swift protégée wipes out several others along the way. These make for the best action sequences: young clean shaven Lincoln taking out each roaring computer-generated vamp (too loud to be scary) disguised as store owners and pharmacists.<br/><br/>Then after a pivotal sequence where our hero lays down his axe for politics, we skip several years ahead. America's in the throes of The Civil War and Lincoln, with signature beard and stove top hat, resides in the white house. Putting a spin on real life events, like the death of Lincoln's son, not only suspends disbelief but throws history in the garbage. Is it in bad taste reshaping the battle of Gettysburg into a gory vampire bloodfest for geeks to marvel at? Sure it is.<br/><br/>But a more contained and personal battle aboard a train – with all the characters together including the main villain who wants to dominate the world – makes us remember this is only a movie. And if you turn off your brain just right, it can be a somewhat entertaining one.<br/><br/>for more reviews: www.cultfilmfreaks.com"

","Timur Bekmambetov is one of the most visually focused directors currently working. All three of his most famous preceding films are shining examples of style over substance, and featured cars driving on the sides of skyscrapers and shots following curving bullets through the air. While their stories and characters could never match the sumptuous eye candy, his style has never failed him. Similarly to his World of Watches films (which involved a war between good and evil over a piece of chalk), Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is a movie that many could be forgiven for labeling as pulpy fun at best. Incredible title aside, Vampire Hunter takes itself and its bloodthirsty antagonists quite seriously. There are no attempts at limp comic relief, no Lincoln casually spewing the words for which he is known, and (almost) no sexy bloodsuckers. Our sixteenth president dispatches his opponents with swift, gory efficiency, all the while looking cool while doing it. Many fight scenes manage to touch all four walls of a room (and occasionally the ceiling) before the final silver-riddled corpse hits the ground. Each major encounter tops the last, culminating in a truly spectacular clash aboard a moving train. Of course, the entire film cannot be axes spitting skulls, and it is in these other areas that the film stumbles. Young Lincoln witnesses his mother's death at the hands of a vampire, and is taken under the wing of veteran vampire killer Henry Sturgess to learn the coveted art. Henry explains that the life of a hunter does not leave room for attachments or relationships. Lincoln, though, falls in love with and marries Mary Todd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). Their interactions would be more meaningful if they were better written. Seth Grahame-Smith, who wrote the screenplay adapted from his own novel, does not imbue his characters with much humanity. Sure, Lincoln shows emotion and wears grim expressions, but he might as well be the Terminator. Winstead, despite delivering the best performance in the film, cannot enliven conversations by herself. Neither the acting nor the writing allow conversations to fascinate or resonate. Now obviously, this film takes a few liberties with history. The south apparently consisted mostly of vampires, and slavery was nothing but a front to provide them with ample stockpiles of food. And the vampires were not fighting for their right to own slaves, but rather for the chance to establish an entire nation of bloodsuckers. How they would divvy up any unfortunate humans over an entire continent once that happened is anyone's guess. Also, Stephen Douglas is featured in the film, is capably played by Alan Tudyk, and is portrayed as being a pro-slavery activist. Douglas exists solely to provide the political Lincoln with an opponent, and is left feeling inconsequential as well as inaccurate. To its credit, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is full of sound and fury where it counts. Blood and death are the orders of the day, and are delivered in satisfying bursts. However, interchangeable characters and wooden dialogue prevent it from becoming anything more than a competently stylish action-horror flick."

","Remember when one of America's most famous presidents was also slaying vampires as a hobby? No? Well now you do. When we receive a title such as Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter, instantly your mind thinks the worst. The implausibilities and historical inaccuracies (despite being completely fictional) would be enough to send historians into frenzy. But actually, and I would never lie to you, it's pretty damn good fun. At a young age, Lincoln witnesses the death of his mother by the fangs of a vampire. Fraught with vengeance, he soon becomes a vampire hunter. If you've seen any vampire film ever (sure, include 'Twilight'), then you know what you are getting yourself involved with. It doesn't stray away from the typical formula, which in itself does lead to several moments of sluggish monotony and instant predictably. But there is a style. A style comprised of slow-motion axe-swinging blood-swishing action, that just makes the whole damn film entertainingly watchable. Sure, it takes itself incredibly seriously and integrates several key moments of American history with vampiric fictionalisation (particularly the battle of Gettysburg), to a point where the absence of self-awareness is missed and could've made Lincoln's life satirically hilarious. Still, I didn't hate any of it. Walker's role as Lincoln isn't exactly Daniel Day-Lewis, yet he gets the job done with an assured performance. However the main appeal is the stylistic violence that is practically the essence of the narrative. Vampires hijacking a train packed with silver where Lincoln is running atop the carriages, swinging his lumbering axe (no innuendo) in slow-motion. Pure. Disposable. Entertainment. The 3D gimmicky visual effects aren't exactly welcomed either, but it's not too much of a deterrent. The final minute was stupid though, I hate it when cheap films end on a meaningless one liner. Overall, a light, rapidly paced plot with good performances and stylistic action made for simple, mindless entertainment."

","Even though I did read the novel first, it still took me a few minutes to get the gist of what was going on, as scenes moved with perhaps too quick of a pace. I feel anyone seeing this film before reading the novel beforehand may become a bit confused. A few negatives for me was that this film reminded me too much of ""Van Helsing""(2004), with too much special effects and little else; also, the ending was different and less effective that the superior novel's ending. Lastly, there's no John Wilkes Booth to be found at all, and that was the biggest disappointment, as his final meeting with Henry(novel)is a great moment, but it was foolishly ignored in the film. All of that being said, this was an entertaining film, with decent performances, especially by Dominic Cooper(Henry), and Rufus Sewell(Adam), and I also liked some of the vampire transformations. I wished there were more scenes with Henry, a ""good"" vampire, if you will, and some mention of Booth, as I stated above.

","I had trouble believing Lincoln's mom (Robin McLeavy) was killed by a vampire when I am pretty sure it was a zombie infestation. Lincoln (Benjamin Walker) vows revenge and is taken under the tutoring of Henry Sturges (Dominic Cooper) a backwoods Van Helsing. In spite of the vampire's brute strength, our rail splitter is able to keep pace. These are not real vampires, but those new Hollywood ""Twilight"" vampires that can go out into the sunlight.<br/><br/>The events of Lincoln's life is at times out of sequence and incorrect. They put a disclaimer at the beginning of the film saying history isn't always recorded correctly. That is all fine and well, but they should have made it a little closer to demonstrate the writer took some time to do some research. As a vampire film, this has a few good special effects, but nothing we haven't seen before. There are plenty of vampire films out there I thought were vastly superior to this one.<br/><br/>The unique aspect of this film is the addition of Lincoln which frankly wasn't integrated into the film that well from an historical point of view. I thought Asylum (Lincoln vs Zombies)did a better job at integrating history. They spent a lot of money for special effects and a substandard script.

This is all bought to you by the same type of people who run Ancient Aliens night and day on what's supposed to be the History Channel. It's bad for us.<br/><br/>That being said, if you take away the CGI super-action, they do create a pretty good representation of the pre-war and Civil War era. Benjamin Walker is actually pretty convincing as Lincoln, especially considering all the silly stuff he has to do. The rest of the top line cast is good as well. So, despite all the problems with this whole thing, I was able to find things I liked in this movie. <br/><br/>The ongoing discussion of slavery throughout the movie is taken on decently, almost making me wish that they could inject some more real history into this subject matter. <br/><br/>See this movie if you're interested, but don't expect more than the usual big time CGI action adventure that will most likely leave you cold when it's over."

And Hollywood productions often insist upon a particular plot sequence.<br/><br/>The basis of the story is a clever idea. Take a famous character from American history and place him into an entirely different genre (horror). It is saying that the horror of war isn't enough....vampires are also required to spice things up. Not a bad idea.<br/><br/>Benjamin Walker plays the role of Abe Lincoln convincingly throughout and the other cast back him up. The action scenes are based upon the slow-mo originality provided by the Matrix and the kung-fu jinks of Chinese action movies.<br/><br/>But this movie has a glaring fault that I'm surprised wasn't picked up during production.

","Rating-6/10<br/><br/>Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is a fantasy horror movie presenting a rather warped view of history, and boy does it bring along some action with it. With crazy fight scenes and a rather serious tone too, this is one movie that can bend the way you look at it. It is enjoyable though, and despite what some say about its rather stupid tones, it is still fun and just rather exciting, an OK film but fun all round in my opinion.<br/><br/>To be fair the movie is pretty silly in it's premise, because not only is it about the 16th president of the United States killing vampires like cows in a slaughter house, but also brings in actual events and claims some important parts of history involved vampires in some way, although fictional still kind of stupid at times. I did however enjoy the story and the writing is done well by Seth Grahame-Smith who is also the author of the book this is based on and he manages to create not only an interesting plot but one that never makes you bored or feel this is just another take on vampires.<br/><br/>I found the acting side to be slightly on the dull side, now it isn't that the cast do bad or anything but they can feel slightly bored and not utilized enough. Benjamin Walker as Lincoln(who happens to look like a young Liam Neeson) is OK and manages the main role well, other cast such as Dominic Cooper, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Rufus Sewell all do well and I can't really say any ruin the film at any point, just as I say sometimes it feels the fighting choreography and effects overshadow the acting. <br/><br/>When we come to the fighting it is ferocious stuff, and very very fast paced so don't blink or you may miss yet another decapitation. Timur Bekmambetov directs this and his experience with his film ""Wanted"" really comes into shape here with all the slow motion but then straight back to fast fighting and an array of gravity defying stunts and weapons people of the day could only dream of owning. The horror element that comes with this is good, but what I will say is that sometimes the horror can be only around the beginning and the fighting and gore can overshadow the truly scary parts, still there though.<br/><br/>This isn't a movie typical among monster like films, now that does come mostly from the fact this is Abraham Lincoln here but it also feels different, the vampires seem apart from the usual bunch and can be both good and bad. The vampires are of course blood suckers but it still explains more about them than some films do and also brings a certain humanity to them in the ways you can kill them. I want to just also say about the effects used, now they are not the best but not the worst and for the budget this movie has they are OK. One thing I need to mention though is there over use, at times the action is too intense and so the CGI comes in and kind of takes out the feeling of the time this is set, and any minor feeling that Lincoln could have actually hunted vampires.<br/><br/>Overall I felt it to be just about OK and one movie that although divides critics, certainly can be liked by many. If your looking for something to rent say on a night then this is a good little watch and find, with an axe wielding president, vampires with the most repulsive attack face and a weird kind of history lesson, this is a definite must see for action fans, but really not for your typical history classes."
"coltens14","Null","0","0","10 April 2014"," Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter
","Among Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter's problems - and they are legion - is not its inherently goofy hook: The 16th president spent his early years dispatching the undead fiends that had infiltrated the new republic, only to later find himself back at odds with Confederate undead during his famed Civil War administration. In a year that also brought filmgoers another serious, high-minded Lincoln film full of award-ready performances and lofty ideas, the notion of Abe slaying vampires is a perfectly fun and welcome basis for big, summer-blockbuster silliness.<br/><br/>However, screenwriter Seth Grahame-Smith, producer Tim Burton, and most of all director Timur Bekmambetov take their Van Helsing version of Lincoln far too seriously, treating the vamp-dusting proceedings not like a cheesy, campy flick, but an essay prompt on a social studies exam. Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter opens with a solemn quote from the Book of Genesis when it would have been better off taking a page from Roger Corman. Cleaved of a sense of tongue-in-cheek camp or humor, the film that follows is smothered in faux nobility as the Great Emancipator mows down bloodsuckers with grim determination.<br/><br/>Bekmambetov's never been a model of stylistic restraint. First with the spastic Russian fantasy-action epics Night Watch and Day Watch and then in Hollywood's Wanted, the director explored new ways of making his ADD-edited action films feel ponderous despite his trademark visual seizures and penchant for slo-mo, sped-up, slow-again action shots. That leaves Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, a film full of restless kinetic energy but no juice. There is an intentional artifice to Bekmambetov's cinema that gives it a faded one-dimensionality, as if his films are grim lithographs. They are full of spraying blood, but no beating heart, with no room for humanity amid the arch monochromatic tableaux.<br/><br/>The director's much-ballyhooed fight visuals are impressive in small doses, and he can execute a dazzling batch of shots, but there is no grasp of scene, and the CGI-staged stunts have no emotional heft - they are just eye-popping tricks lacking a gut-punch. All is constant titillation with no giggling exploitation flavor - it is spectacle and sensation, epic chintz and chutzpah, none of it making much sense. Bekmambetov loves to pan over iconography, from stovepipe hats to the Washington Monument, but his characters feel as though they are also carved in the sides of granite tombs, frozen forever astride destiny but not really going anywhere. It is not the best approach for a film that must already carefully straddle and draw cinematic friction from two very different genres.<br/><br/>As Abe, Benjamin Walker keeps striving for charisma beneath the top hat, but is continually interrupted by training montages in which he leans to twirl his silver-edged ax. And Mary Elizabeth Winstead also does her best as a coquettish Mary Todd, but the moment she and Walker start to fan flames of courtship chemistry, Bekmambetov yanks Abe back to work at the frenzied, nonsensical vampire slaying. The cast is rounded out by Rufus Sewell easily tossing off snooty, aristocratic villainy without spilling his brandy. But as Abe's mysterious mentor in the vamp-combat arts, the very talented Dominic Cooper seems further doomed to play supporting characters in Hollywood fantasies. Anthony Mackie and Jimmi Simpson are also on hand as a couple of Lincoln's long-time compatriots.<br/><br/>As with so much Hollywood escapism these days, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter mistakes premise for plot - disjointed and scattershot, the film feels fuller of ideas than sense. About two-thirds of the way through, having run out of things to do, Abraham Lincoln gives up on having the Young Man with an Ax routine and rushes through Lincoln's political rise - the narrative economy no doubt encouraged by a disappointing lack of beheading during the Lincoln-Douglas debates.<br/><br/>Suddenly, the film arrives at the Civil War and Gettysburg where Bekmambetov plays at historical melodrama, slapping awkward faux glory on civil war scenes. There are also attempts throughout to blame the Southern slavery culture on vampires, which might be offensive if the filmmakers cared about what they were saying. Offensive or not, played the right way, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter could have been howling, eye-rolling fun. But Bekmambetov cannot figure out how to wink at his audience through the deadpan, and so the film feels so much duller than its catchy title promises."

","There are 2 things I really dislike about this film. First, it's one of the dumbest plots in cinematic history. Second, there is so much CGI here that you are tempted to spend more time speculating what is real and what is CGI, that you may forget to pay attention to the story.<br/><br/>That's not to say it's a bad film, because it is very entertaining.<br/><br/>One of the things I liked was how cleverly they wove real history into this ridiculous plot. For example, the death of Lincoln's son and the alliance between the vampires and Jefferson Davis. It's really quite clever.<br/><br/>Now, about the CGI. Too much, too much, too much. In some spots it became little more than a kung fu movie. And the scene where Lincoln and his nemesis are jumping across the backs of stampeding horses...dumb, dumb, dumb. Perhaps the most notorious overdone CGI here are the sequences on the train! But, CGI did its magic in some good ways to -- when it put us in historical settings; that was quite impressive.<br/><br/>In terms of the acting, I won't dwell long here. I thought Benjamin Wilaker, as Lincoln did quite a good job. But the standout here is Anthony Mackie...and considering the number of films he's recently appeared in, currently appearing in, or working on...well, I guess lots of people are as impressed as I am.<br/><br/>Although in some ways the film is cleverly crafted, in other ways it is just so damn dumb.

The only thing I didn't understand was the use of silver to kill vampires. It was mentioned that Judas was paid with silver when he betrayed Jesus, so that's why silver can be used to kill vampires. Well, then, what was used to kill vampires BEFORE this happened. I mean, the vampire Adam mentioned that he's 5000 years old, which is 3000 years before Judas. So, silver was just fine before, but as soon as Judas was paid with silver, then voila, silver is all of a sudden deadly to vampires."

Also the idea that the former president is blessed with the flexibility and skills to shame a gymnast was too far fetched. Some of the support characters were weak and badly written, this was clear by the uncomfortable wooden acting. The sub-plots were also unclear as in the case of the characters Joshua Speed and Will Johnson. These characters seem to be added only to grease the wheels of the weak plot and they had little or no definition, both characters seemed to be hanging around the lead for most of the movie with no real reason other than to jump in at the nail biting moments and save the day.

Also in the area is the main vampire. In the meantime Lincoln studies law, becomes involved in politics, wins the presidency, and the civil war begins. The main vampire is a big fan of slavery because it gives him plenty of bodies. So the civil war will turn out to be the north against the vampires in the south. The main vampire also manages to attack Lincoln's son. As these vampires can only be killed with a silver bullet, Lincoln has to to gather all the silver he can get to provide the army with enough bullets to destroy all the vampires, but he first has to transport all that silver to the battlefront.<br/><br/>Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is surprisingly an entertaining action flick. I wasn't expecting much but ended up enjoying it. You can't expect much in terms of character development but Lincoln's vampire friend is somewhat of an interesting character. The fight sequences are pretty well filmed. The larger and more complex CGI scenes don't convince, they look pretty cheesy but I didn't mind. The final fight on top of a moving train, at night, surrounded by fire is too cliché.

","From the title, you would probably simply skip past this with a passing thought of 'I can't believe they made that' before quickly forgetting it and selecting some other DVD. However, having taken a chance, I have to say it was quite enjoyable. There are some clichés of course as with most vampire films, but there are also some different takes on the vampires themselves and what they can and cannot do. As the title suggests,the main character is indeed Abraham Lincoln of USA Presidential fame and follows his life for early childhood to Vampire hunter and onto politics and president. Now I know it sounds mad, I mean how can a president get out and about without anyone knowing and go vampire hunting, however, remember this is the early days of America, the Whitehouse has just been built and the American Civil War is on. So there are no secret service or FBI following the president around and to be fair, most of the vampire hunting happens before he becomes president. Although the film covers many years in the life of one man the pace is quick and it does not drag on, skipping large chunks of his life that are not important to the story which is a good thing rather than bad. There is a bit of a dodgy train scene near the end where you kind of have to stretch the imagination to believe it but apart from that the film is a lot better than the title or the trailer suggests. If you're into vampire films and fancy taking a change, I would give it a go. Just don't expect to be overwhelmed by the script."

","When young Abraham Lincoln angers a man (who happens to a vampire), the man takes his revenge by killing the boy's mother. Lincoln then dedicates his life to finding vampires and killing them with his silver-tipped ax.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this movie. Yes, it's horrifically gory at times, but the clever mix of fantasy and true events is cleverly done and I wouldn't wait to see what would happen next. We follow Lincoln from store clerk to the White House. The movie isn't playing for laughs, it's utterly serious. I actually found it more entertaining than Daniel Day-Lewis' ""Lincoln."" <br/><br/>The title had me expecting a cheesy, low-budget slasher, but the production values are high and the special effects are excellent. The acting is also very good; Benjamin Walker plays a convincing Lincoln and Rufus Sewell is truly menacing as his nemesis.<br/><br/>This is a surprising, clever story that includes just enough historical facts to make it almost plausible. A lot of blood, but still recommended."

It was absolutely ridiculous and I loved it. If you were going to take this film seriously then you really need to examine the title again. <br/><br/>I went to see this with a friend and we laughed our way through the film. The action is actually very well done, although its a little heavy on CGI, and Benjamin Walker makes a very good Abraham Lincoln. But sometimes the action gets so infeasible that you can't help but laugh. For example; a vampire HAMMERTHROWS A HORSE BY ITS HIND LEGS. Having said this, we both agreed the fight scenes were kick-ass.<br/><br/>Although this film is absolutely silly and mostly fight scenes, there is enough back story and normal bits to ensure a plot continues throughout the film. The dialogue is sometimes cheesy, sometimes witty, always delightful!<br/><br/>WARNING: If you have read the book and are gonna be precious about it then don't go a mile near this film. I read the book after the film and was shocked at how different they are. They really only have character names in common and even then...The only thing I was kinda annoyed they changed was the ending as the ending in the book made me so happy I actually wanted to cry whereas the movie ending upset me.<br/><br/>But basically if you act as though the film is not remotely based on the book it actually stands on its own very well.

","This film is based on a novel (which by the way has a different ending), and shows Abraham Lincoln, in an alternate world where he loses his mother to vampires, and fight against them in his revenge and eventually in a Civil War, where the South uses them as secret weapon. The script is mildly interesting and use historical facts, that were changed or omitted (eg the 4 children of Lincoln does not exist here), admixed with the central plot - the acting is good, but nothing worth of an Oscar. <br/><br/>The most prominent and attractive feature is the photography of the movie that uses some cool effects (Matrix style) and color contrasts that are very interesting in several scenes. <br/><br/>But there again: any script of other era with vampires would be cool anyway - the way the inspiration in Interview with the Vampire by Anne Rice is more than obvious to me ... uncompromising, is a good fun action movie, but a poor movie overall in other aspects. <br/><br/>Another advise: if you will watch it in normal LED / LCD / Plasmas Television the image is very good, but you see int he scenes that it was made to watch in 3D televisions.

","While I was apprehensive going into to this film for many reasons, from the relatively unknown actor who portrays Lincoln to the idea that Lincoln was a vampire hunter, I called shenanigans before I even sat down to watch this film. Vampire Hunter blew my expectations out of the water. This movies has the right amount of political portrayal mixed in with the right amount of vampire slaying, brought to you by who other then perhaps America's most influential president, Abraham Lincoln. The acting is superb, cinematography is absolutely amazing, and the portrayal of a somewhat over the top story was not overwhelmed with vampires being killed everywhere you turned. Contrary to what I thought when I first sat down to watch it, this movie did not focus solely on the vampire aspect, but spanned Lincoln's whole life including childhood, love, lust, vampires and politics. Leaves me looking forward to perhaps a Vampire Hunter sequel? I'll just settle for other films from Benjamin Walker. Great job!"
"blackprojectionist","6","0","0","1 December 2012"," Wasn't Fredrick Douglass Killing Vampires in the South, Too?
","With all these films with Abraham Lincoln coming out this year, I thought I'd give my two cents, beginning with Timur Bekmambetov's adaptation of Seth Grahame-Smith's novel Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter. Bekmambetov is a Russian-Kazakh director who does his thing both in Hollywood and on his home turf. Seth Grahame-Smith is a filmmaker from Long Island who has been working with Tim Burton, wrote the screenplay for Burton's Dark Shadows. Grahame-Greene is a good writer. So I was interested in seeing how he would treat the story in this turning point in our country's history. He came with the idea that the South had amassed a bunch of vampires who were living off the blood of slaves. An interesting place to start a film. The film even has a freedman side kick childhood friend, ""Will Johnson"" in Anthony Mackey, of whom I'm a big fan. But alas, black folks were very much in the shadows of Lincoln and his martial arts master vampire killing sifu ""Henry Sturges,"" played by Dominic Cooper. Mackey get's a tiny bit of martial arts action and even does a move that looks very capoeira-like, but this is a story about Lincoln, played with some charm by Benjamin Walker. It would have been a great opportunity to imagine Fredrick Douglass as an ass kicking martial arts knowing vampire slayer right there with Lincoln. The film is a blockbuster with all the perks of a blockbuster $69 million budget, incredible animation, sweeping animated photography, gravity defying martial arts... it's a lot of fun, really, unless you're Black and keep feeling marginalized by not having enough contribution to the vanquishing of this evil which sank its roots into the origin of slavery in this country."
"davylevine","8","0","0","1 December 2012"," Great fun. Lots of humor. Historically accurate (mutatis mutandi).
","What's not to like? -- not a lot. I enjoyed it very much from start to finish. It is a movie that keeps its tongue in its cheek at all times. The special effects rival those of Crouching Tiger H.D. and Titanic, while not as elegant as Avatar. Abe Lincoln was a working class president with a great sense of humor, something which the movie didn't quite capture, although the allusion is there. It is, after all, a comic book of a film, with both lots of comic book violence and some great movie mayhem. While the movie Abe is sweet and charming, the historic Abe's anecdotes and stories would keep people in thrall for hours. Ben Walker's Abe Lincoln is a bit too laid back to be very captivating. The real Abe was a vital, charming character, but not so pretty. I thought in general the movie version of Abe's life was rather flat and understated. Too kind, perhaps, to Mary Todd, who was a very difficult person. I loved how the movie linked slavery with the evils of vampires. These vampires are mean! Not like the gentle souls in the teenage vampire movies. No delicate puncture wounds here. In fact, these vampires come to be linked to slavery in several surprising ways, which I felt required a deft, light hand. Timur Bekmambetov caught that aspect just right and made the film both historically accurate as well as providing justification for movie Abe's eventual anti- slavery position. As a history buff I appreciated the research and attention to detail that went into the making of the film. The fight scenes are marvels of choreography. The cinematography is perfect. The acting was adequate, if understated. Tim Burton is a genius and his hand is evident throughout. I was expecting a B movie, but I give this movie a solid 8 stars. It is well worth watching and will delight on many levels."

"TxMike","Null","0","0","8 November 2012"," A better vampire story, blends real American history with vampire myth.
","I really like this movie. I went into watching it thinking it might be cheesy but it is very well made and has a bit of good American History in it to boot! Plus, being a Tim Burton film, even if you don't like it you know it will be exciting.<br/><br/>The basic story is the real one of Abraham Lincoln, starting out in 1818 when he was a young boy of 9, and ending after he, as President of the United States, gives his now famous Gettysburg in 1863. It includes his meeting and eventually marrying Mary Todd.<br/><br/>Now layer on top of that the ""untold story"" which involves Vampires. That part begins when young Abe awakens one night and sees his own mother being attacked by a Vampire. From that moment he made a vow to himself to devote his life to hunting and killing Vampires.<br/><br/>Of course it wasn't easy, he needed help from a trustworthy Vampire who helped train him. His great revelation was to use an axe with a silver cutting edge, allowing him to decapitate and kill Vampires.<br/><br/>The story also uses the Vampire factor in the Civil War. When the South finds itself outmanned, a Vampire leader vows support, all the Vampires that they need. But Abe has another revelation one evening, while holding a silver fork. If they were to melt down all the silver they could get, and make bullets and other weapons, they could even defeat the Vampire soldiers.<br/><br/>The conclusion of the story focuses on the Battle of Gettysburg. Even though the war lasted until 1865, the defeat of General Robert E. Lee at Gettysburg in 1863 was a milestone, and the address President Lincoln gave is one of the most meaningful in American History.<br/><br/>Good movie, for anyone who enjoys a good Vampire story.<br/><br/>Benjamin Walker with appropriate makeup looks very much like the Abraham Lincoln we recognize from historical images, and he does a fine job in the title role. Dominic Cooper is Henry Sturges, the friendly Vampire who helps Honest Abe. Anthony Mackie is his life-long friend, former slave Will Johnson. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is good as Mary Todd Lincoln. And always good, especially as a villain, is Rufus Sewell as Adam the mighty Vampire leader."

","I just saw this movie the other night. The movie tries to capture the life of the main character Abraham Lincoln. You will see him growing up, losing his parents and see him developing his skills as a vampire hunter. You never really feel anything for him though. He wants to kill some vampires because of revenge. So he goes out training with this master vampire hunter guy who is like a rock star screwing all these chicks. You will see Abraham train with his weapon of choice the SILVER AXE. It's really a joke, it reminded me of some bad action b-movies where the hero is getting trained by the super cool teacher. His AXE skills are a joke. Maybe he had some fight training especially for this movie, but it's just not believable at all. Abraham looks like some 90's kid who got a toy AXE for Christmas and goes out swinging with the thing like a retard. Well anyways, he goes out chopping Vampire Heads of like he has some special talent for it.<br/><br/>I didn't connect with Lincoln or any of the other characters in this movie. This had mainly to do with really poor acting and cheese writing. In some more serious and dramatic moments in the movie everything just don't seem believable and feels really forced.<br/><br/>A little plus on this movie, is it's CGI action scenes. It has some stunning visuals like for example the horse chase scene where Lincoln tries to capture some long time vampire foe. But overall, I don't think CGI makes up for all the bad stuff in this movie.<br/><br/>In some parts of the movie I actually fell asleep because of the really shallow and cheesy scenes about love, romance and character development. It really felt as if those were fillers between the action scenes. But whenever I heard some loud slash sounds, I woke up, but soon as the action blood spoiled scene was over (which gave me some satisfaction and entertainment), I'd close my eyes again and sleep like a baby."

"ransomstoddard","4","3","8","25 June 2012"," High Concept doesn't live up to potential
","Much like ""Snakes on a Plane,"" the entire movie is pretty much described in the title. Having said that, the notion of the Great Emancipator as a Hunter should provide a lot of material to make a great film from. Unfortunately, Seth Graeme-Smith's screenplay and Timur Bekmambetov's direction drop the ball in many places. There is far too little characterization, nothing to really draw us in to Abe's desire for vengeance or Mary's attraction to Abe himself. I'll forgive the egregious historical inaccuracies, because this is, after all, an alternate reality. The action sequences are phenomenal and go a long way to make up for a very slow first 30 minutes, but overall this film misses the mark. The final couple of scenes set the stage for a potential sequel, and if so I hope the scriptwriter is more adept than Graeme-Smith at creating relatable characters."

But to me it's just a big waste of time and money. The poster looks fantastic, thats probably where all the money went. <br/><br/>From the very first frame you get a good sense of where this film is going, absolutely nowhere. I guess it's made with a home or semi-pro camera. (thats how it looks to me) Most of the time thats my cue to sign off. But the trailer i saw seemed promising so i stuck with it. But after 30 minutes i got so bored with the bad acting and the terrible dialog i had to call it quits. What a shame that so many bad directors give the horror genre a bad name.

"WydeOpen","3","3","9","22 June 2012"," Despite it's flaws, the movie is still superficially entertaining.
","Call me old school but I learned just about everything I needed to know about vampires from the classic mid-80s movies Fright Night and The Lost Boys.Rule numero uno: sunlight kills vampires. Period. If it can tolerate daytime, it's not a vampire. So with this in mind, know that everything that is right about Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, none of it overcomes this flaw in it's premise. By-the- way, there's not a whole lot right with the movie anyway. <br/><br/>Based off the popular novel of the same name by Seth Gramme-Smith, Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter, the film explores the premise of what if the 16th POTUS was motivated his entire life by a deep seeded hatred and personal vendetta against ""vampires"". (Please take note of the sarcastic quotation marks). <br/><br/>These (historically) creatures of the night masquerade in 19th century America as inn-keepers, pastors, blacksmiths and among other things, plantation/ slave owners. The last of which is morally reprehensible to ""Honest Abe"" because his mother was killed by a racist ""vampire"" and his life long best friend is a abolitionist Black man (The Hurt Locker's Anthony Mackie)<br/><br/>The main problem with this film (besides my beef with the misappropriation of the word vampire) is that it moves way too fast from scene to scene. The pace reminded me of the way a comic book reads resulting in very poor character development and cinematic rhythm. Some scenes were no longer than just a few seconds long; about the time it takes to read a page or two of a graphic novel. <br/><br/>The novel is described as  ""mash-up"" of comic, horror, historical and thriller genres. Unfortunately, the film just doesn't successfully get the chemistry correct. There is little in the way of comedy, horror, thrills or historical accuracy to be found. The script is full of plot holes and logical inconsistencies that make as much sense as the silent ""L"" in Lincoln's part name. <br/><br/>There is, however, enough action to almost make up for the lack of real substance and logic. If the film aimed to be a mind numbing action fest rather than a high brow thought provoking, good humored historical, study into the fictional motivations of the""Great Emancipator"", I may have been less cynical and more forgiving. Ironically, watching a young Liam Nesson looking Benjamin Walker attempt to be an action hero is mildly comedic. Whether this was intentional or not; only the film makers know.<br/><br/>Timur Bekmambetov who directed the 2008 bullet bending Matrix-esque film Wanted, shoots AL:VH's action scenes once again liberally using that super- slowed- down-then-super-sped-up film style that made movies like The Matrix, Wanted and Sherlock Holmes visually clever and stunning. As a matter of fact, this movie could (arguably) be described as 300 meets Holmes meets Blade although I'm still calling foul in the use of the term vampire! (Yeah, I know, I need to let out go.)<br/><br/>The fact that it was filmed in 3D rather than converted to 3D in post production assists this movie from being a complete disaster as the cinematography is remarkable. The camera picks up the smallest detail of the elaborate period sets and the 3D subtlety enhances those minuscule details. <br/><br/>Despite it's flaws, the movie is still superficially entertaining. It may have that odd quality that one day land it cult classic status. Had it not been rated R this movie could have been perfectly marketed towards a young audience and shaped the vampire experience of todays teenagers like Fright Night and The Lost Boys did for me...as long as they don't mind sunlight tolerant..."

The movie has practically nothing to do with the novel, the stories are very different and not for the better. <br/><br/>The movie constantly jumps many years ahead, leaving important questions unanswered, it's as though the producers knew the movie was terrible and just wanted it over with as soon as possible. As I said this leaves many questions unanswered, you are never given any real reason for the different characters motivations besides some very shallow reasons. You never really care about the characters because the movie does not spend any time developing them. And even the main character mr. Lincoln himself is not given much motivation for going in to the vampire hunting trade, nor for becoming a lawyer, politician or president. <br/><br/>What the novel did so well making all the characters so human and making you feel that all the sacrifices that Abraham makes through his long and lonely life, are worth it in the end. Instead we get a shallow and stupid movie that has nothing to do with the book and trades a great story for ridiculous action and a super hero like Abraham Lincoln.<br/><br/>Take my advise, don't ever waste your time watching this piece of garbage, but pick up the book instead because that one is actually good.<br/><br/>Just a final note, no I would not have liked the movie any more if I had not read the book first, but I probably would have never read the book afterwards, which would have been a shame."

","When I first decided to watch this movie, I have to admit that I was somewhat apprehensive. Mainly due to the fact that the movie market for vampire movies is so glutted with terrible movies and TV shows right now. I was expecting a cheesy vampirey love story, toss in some cheap SFX and maybe a soundtrack by Beiber and Lady Gag or something, and poof, straight to the $1.99 bin at the gas station. But I was wrong. Dead Wrong. This movie was GREAT! Finally, Hollywood came up with an original story. Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter. Yeah that's a new one. The relatively unknown actors chosen played their parts did so extremely well. And the crew who put this movie did a wonderful job. The special effects were very well done. There are awesome fight scenes with some original moves and weapons. There is even a bit of a love story about Abraham and Mary Todd. SPOILERS!! The story unfolds with Abraham as a child and how him seeing the treatment of black slaves will affect him for the rest of his life. But history diverges just slightly when he witness his mother being murdered by a vampire. Now Abraham not only has motivation to free the slaves and kick the butt of the confederacy, because they are vampires. Did I mention this is based on a true story. The movie moves along with Abe learning to kick vampire butt from Henry Sturgess. Possibly based on real life historical figure Henry Clay. Henry not only is a vampire, but is involved with freeing the slaves. He soon meets up with Joshua Speed, a real life friend of Lincoln's and soon the three of them are kicking vampire ass down to the Mason/Dixon line. The plot moves along with Lincoln eventually killing the vampire that killed his mom and finding out there thousands more like him coming north. So Abraham decides instead of using weapons he now uses words and becomes President of the US. Time passes and we see Lincoln aged and embroiled in the Civil war. He realizes that they will lose the war unless something drastic happens so they make silver bullets and cannonballs for the final battle of Gettysburg. But the vampires get wind of this plan and try to stop the train. The climactic battle between Abe and the head vampire is really quite a scene. Set on a moving locomotive over burning railroad trestles, it a pretty cool scene. All in all this movie was allot of fun. Lots of Action, cool SFX, a decent and ORIGINAL story makes this a really fun movie."

I was somewhat worried that such a take on a legendary figure could have turned out to be insulting in a way or just inappropriate, but it was actually done well enough. Just put off your reality-goggles when you sit down to watch the movie.<br/><br/>The story is about Abraham Lincoln before becoming the 16th president of America, how his childhood and youth was molded and shaped by a cruel incident in which his mother was taken away from him by a vampire, and Abraham end up in the hands of Henry Sturges who teaches him how to fight vampires.<br/><br/>Actually the story was entertaining, especially because they buffed it up with so much really cool action sequences. And these sequences were nicely executed and made good use of slow-motion capture to emphasize on the action. But the movie wasn't all action, it was also incorporating historical events nicely, of course these were somewhat altered to reflect the movie's story with vampires.<br/><br/>The actors and actresses they had hired for the various roles were doing great jobs with their characters. A big hat off (no pun intended) for Benjamin Walker (playing Abraham Lincoln), Dominic Cooper (playing Henry Sturges), Jimmi Simpson (playing Joshua Speed) and Anthony Mackie (playing Will Johnson), as they really did a great job.<br/><br/>The special effects in the movie were great and really helped the movie along so nicely.<br/><br/>Also the costumes and sets should be mentioned, as they really put a lot of effort into these to make the era and environment come alive on the screen. And they succeeded. It was really a treat to behold and it was like you were right there in the mid 1860's. Really nice work there.<br/><br/>However, one thing that was a disappointment in the movie was the final showdown between Abraham Lincoln and Adam (played by Rufus Sewell). It was really anti-climatic, especially by the way that it ended. That was clumsily planned and horribly executed, and had they opted for something else it would have worked all the better.<br/><br/>Without revealing the ending of the movie, then I will say that it was really a nice touch to the movie, and I would go as far as to say that it was actually one of the best scenes in the entire movie.<br/><br/>So now we have had Abraham Lincoln fight vampires in this movie and zombies in ""Abraham Lincoln vs Zombies"", so what is next? Werewolves? I guess we will just have to wait and see.<br/><br/>But ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" is well worth a watch. Lots of fun and action, and great acting."

","The story revolves around Abe (Abraham Lincoln) who had witnessed a horrifying event during his childhood. He was witness to his mother's death from a vampire bite. This changed his life forever. He decided to end every ""living"" (dead) vampire and chose to become the Vampire Hunter. However, this battle with Vampire symbolized a bigger battle which Abraham Lincoln fought and that was against Slavery.<br/><br/>To be honest, even Abraham Lincoln would surely have laughed after watching this mix of history and fiction. This movie will keep you engaged from beginning to end as you will find it difficult and sometimes tiresome to distinguish between fact and fantasy. Life will become a lot easier for you if you have read the novel with the same title by Seth Grahame-Smith as the movie is a copy of the novel. Let us analyze whether the movie actually lives up to the expectations.<br/><br/>The setting of the film is what is should be. The movie has the perfect setting and you feel like evil spirits will jump from any corner of the screen. The background is mainly old European. Sepia and black are the predominant colors that are used in the film and add to the gory nature of the film. Visually speaking, the movie is a treat to watch. There are lots of fireworks, blood-tarnished fangs of vampires, Gothic architecture; music which is in harmony with the flow of the flick. The movie also has bats and more bats. There is a lot of fast paced action even though the pre-interval half of the movie drags. The blood bath depicted is very realistic and you actually feel at a point that vampires are actually responsible for the blood and the bodies strewn around.<br/><br/>Although mentioned earlier that the pre-interval half of the movie is a drag, nevertheless there are many scenes that are actually worth watching. For example the scene where Mary Todd uses Abraham's hat as a tool to rise up to his height in order to kiss him is innovative, to say the least. In this movie, the leading lady (played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is an interesting character. In the first half of the movie, we see this woman desperately on the look-out for extraordinary adventures. Early in to the second half, we see her as the sire that has suffered the loss of her son. Later, she takes up the mantle of being the woman responsible for the success of Abraham Lincoln. <br/><br/>The debonair, calm and dangerous-when-matters-vampire Henry, played by Dominic Cooper, is by far the best vampire that has been portrayed ever. Benjamin Walker as Abraham Lincoln looks bleak initially, sometime even overshadowed by the characters surrounding him. However, things take a turn when he becomes President. He essays the role of the President to the hilt with his dominating and soaring attitude. Even he looks mesmerizing tired and lanky eyes. <br/><br/>Finally, a word about Timur Bekmambetov, the director of the movie. Timur has done complete justice to Seth Grahame-Smith's novel and has also added a few of his ideas to make a gripping movie out of another blood-dripping novel. The movie could have been a bit more interesting if the director had added a few slices of the popular speeches of Lincoln against slavery. <br/><br/>All in all, in case you are looking for a movie which has a happy ending, Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter is not the one to choose. This movie does not belong to the meek hearted but for the one who loves bloodshed and likes their vampires to be free from humanity."
"RainDogJr","7","2","5","9 September 2012"," Some great mythology, forgettable action, and a weak main performer too
","This has one of the most attractive titles of the year – definitely a premise too cool to miss. Hell, I'm even tracking down the cheap, straight-to-DVD version of it (which is probably s***): ABRAHAM LINCOLN VS. ZOMBIES! Anyway, this is basically an all right flick in almost every aspect. It's not a straight vampire massacre as one could think it is thanks to its title. It takes itself seriously but not much. I ain't something that I intend to watch again; pretty but not very impressive. It's all right, period. <br/><br/>In terms of mythology, it's mostly pretty damn great. It sort-of has the vibe that, I believe, DJANGO UNCHAINED will offer. I mean, this is certainly set in times of slavery, and we have our main character as a lone hero arriving to a town – western material, right? The combination of the American slavery issue and vampires turned out to be interesting and definitely worked – we have vampires buying slaves, and that thing seen as pretty much something good since keeps the rest of the American population safe from vampires. Yeah, that's terrific, interesting as hell mythology for my money. <br/><br/>And visually, well, the film is really nice. This was actually my very first experience with the work of Timur Bekmambetov; but I do know who the guy is and, based on what I've heard, I'm sure that here he remained faithful, for better or worse, to his MATRIX-influenced style. Bekmamvetov's way of presenting the action is not something that gets me excited, to tell the truth. I didn't care for it but at the same time, I can't think in it as a big problem of the film (in other words, it doesn't annoys me). The performance of Benjamin Walker (as Abe) is definitely closer to be a problem. He's not bad, but never truly convinced me and couldn't deal once his part as young Abraham Lincoln ended. Not the best makeup work, though nothing as bad as the work done in Eastwood's J. EDGAR – Mary Elizabeth Winstead, for instance, is fine when she's doing Mary Todd in an older age. <br/><br/>Was I the only one who recalled THE PROTECTOR (the Tony Jaa masterpiece of a martial arts movie) thanks to this? There's a whole sequence dealing with Abe and his main antagonist fighting in the middle of lots or wild horses running. And I recalled that mentioned Tony Jaa flick because Abe's antagonist grabs and throws a horse – in THE PROTECTOR they threw an elephant and that scene delivered an insanely fun moment; I still have it in my mind (just like the whole action of the movie) after 5 or so years of watching it. Will I remember in a near future something about the action (fights, vampire killings and that kind of thing) from ABRAHAM LINCOLN: VAMPIRE HUNTER? I don't think so. So yes, this time I liked more the mythology and that's the main reason why I'm giving a decent rating. <br/><br/>*Watched it on 08 September, 2012"

","What a year of incredibly bad films what's going on here? Come on not you too Stevie losing your touch? A former statesman used to be a blood sucker hunter really? I mean really? Lincoln is about giving a baseless story a fictitious base to stand on good, not so good because it doesn't work it's a lie nobody shall ever buy into. Please don't ever try this again. It got to the point where Lincoln was frustrated with himself stuck between president and hero who shall save me he wondered? Presidents have never played heros because in reality they're all so bad.<br/><br/>Lesson to Hollywood heayweights next time somebody walks in to pitch a script ask if they think it makes any damn sense to them or to the drunk man on the street. If the answer is a resounding yes, go ahead and fund them because that man knows for sure he won't be watching that crap."
"KineticSeoul","7","2","5","10 August 2012"," Not well developed but still entertaining
","Now when I first saw the poster for this movie, it got my attention. I mean Abraham Lincoln is a vampire hunter in a movie? As odd as the connection is, it was intriguing and was awaiting for this movie to come out. Now was it a amazing movie that has a lot of creativity going for it? Not really, but it's still a entertaining movie that gets better as it progresses. When this movie started after couple of minutes in I thought it was going to suck. But it gradually started to build it's momentum. Now the main flaw about this movie is the editing and how the story progresses. Now this movie is based on a novel so it probably can't fit everything in here. But the movie felt like it skipped around a lot of stuff. Like if this movie came out on Blu-ray or DVD it my have some extended parts but just wasn't put in the theatrical released version or something. The editing just felt all over the place all around and didn't seem coherent. Also I know I sometimes put emphasis on development of characters although some movies are fine without much development. But this movie revolves around the man the legend Abraham Lincoln, one of the most popular and notorious president. But for the most part especially Abraham's younger yrs, it didn't feel like it was Abraham Lincoln. Like the character didn't stand out as the soon to be legendary president. And seemed like it could have been anybody for a while. Which is a bit disappointing, even if it's fictional it would have been nice if there was more depth and development in a imaginative way. So he at least seem like Abraham Lincoln. But I guess that is just a small gripe, cause this movie isn't about Abraham Lincoln's biographic movie but it's him kicking vampire ass. And I gotta admit he is a badass in this movie. Besides the upcoming movie featuring Daniel Day-Lewis ""Lincoln"" is the movie that tells the story in a realistic direction of the rise of a great president. I guess you can think of this movie kinda like ""Inglourious Basterds"" except less self indulgent and with more focus on action instead of dialogue. And the vampire killing action is sweet in this and there is a lot of it. Even the way the movie ended, it left in a good note. Overall I enjoyed this movie and might see it again, not a great one but it's entertaining.<br/><br/>7.5/10"
"cameron3673","7","2","5","5 August 2012"," Fun to watch but very ridiculous.
","Despite the negative reviews this movie is actually not that bad. It is disappointing that the movie is rated so highly as the target audience would be far better suited at 15 year old boys.<br/><br/>There are some negative aspects such as some poor acting and some unusual editing choices such as some badly cut sequences where we have a strange flashback and you only know we are flashing back due to some makeup cues. Another aspect is that you need to know a little bit of Abe's history to make sense of some of the story. Thank goodness for the Simpsons so that non-Americans have some idea of what is going on.<br/><br/>The action sequences are entertaining while bordering on the completely ridiculous and occasionally cause a laugh at the completely unbelievable nature of how characters can survive being thrown across a room and smash walls to pieces and still walk away or keep fighting.<br/><br/>One major annoying aspect of this film is that Abe can suddenly be this amazing fighting hunter with only ten minutes of training in the woods. A little more training than telling yourself the truth would have been a great addition to the film. This training is one of the negative aspects of the film.<br/><br/>This movie is worth seeing and a lot of fun but you need to take into mind that the movie is ridiculous, the action scenes over rely on CG with no practical performances and it has very limited historical accuracy."
"djs-specs","8","2","5","3 August 2012"," A lot of fun!
","If you have a problem with movies that are played totally straight yet the premise is completely ridiculous, this move is so not for you. I mean, seriously, the title says it all - the 16th president of the USA hunts down the ravaging undead with his trusty axe. A historical-horror-action film, its meant to be silly as all get-out and that's what makes it fun.<br/><br/>The cast performed solidly, the make-up and costuming were great and the effects were sublime. Seriously, the action scenes were worth the price of admission alone for me. The script could've done with a bit of work, but you can't win them all I suppose.<br/><br/>If your like your movie premises silly and your action kickass, you will probably like this film. Don't go in expecting art or Oscar-worthy material because you will be disappointed."
"zardoz-13","10","2","5","8 July 2012"," Fang-tastic!!!
","Rarely does the cinematic adaptation of a novel surpass its literary source. Happily, ""Wanted"" director Timur Bekmambetov's ""Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter"" proves the exception to the rule. Author Seth Grahame-Smith, who wrote the epistolary bestseller, also penned the imaginative screenplay. Incidentally, Grahame-Smith forged the monster-mash-up literary genre. In 2009, he spliced elements of a zombie story into a revised version of Jane Austin's classic masterpiece ""Pride and Prejudice."" The result was the ""New York Times"" bestseller ""Pride & Prejudice and Zombies."" The author then wrote ""Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter"" and added vampire slaying as Lincoln's covert pastime. Compared with Grahame-Smith's 2010 bestseller, the celluloid version of ""Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter"" is ten times better. Primarily, Bekmambetov's chiller dispenses with all the plodding biographical parts of Grahame-Smith's bestseller and boasts a thoroughly evil villain as the eponymous hero's chief adversary. Anybody who has read the novel knows that the journal Lincoln keeps about his efforts to eradicate fangsters is what prompts a 21st century writer into reassemble Lincoln's real life with his fantasy exploits. Meantime, Berkmambetov and Grahame-Smith take a serious approach to their outlandish subject matter. Nothing about the vampire hunting deeds of Lincoln is depicted with a wink and a nudge. If you saw director Tim Burton's abominable ""Dark Shadows,"" neither Burton nor Grahame-Smith treated the venerable Gothic day-time soap opera with anything resembling either respect or sobriety. Instead, ""Dark Shadows"" owed more to Burton's ""Beetlejuice"" than Dan Curtis' soaper. Bekmambetov and Grahame-Smith didn't commit the same mistake.<br/><br/>""Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter"" unfolds in the year 1818, in Indiana. Our hero (newcomer Lux Haney-Jardine) witnesses first-hand the evil of slavery. One of young Abe's friends, William Johnson (Curtis Harris of ""Touched""), is lashed by a slaver after the youth struggles to prevent his family from being split up and sold down river. Lincoln's father intervenes, and his boss, Jack Barts (Marton Csokas of ""Æon Flux""), fires him and then demands immediate payment of his debts. The defiant Lincoln refuses to pay up. Later, that night, Barts slips into their isolated wooden house and bites Nancy Lincoln. Young Abe witnessed this murderous deed and vows to avenge his mom's demise. The legendary rails splitter has grown up considerably when he tries to kill Bart by shooting him at point blank range with a cap and ball black powder pistol. Miraculously, at least to Abe's way of thinking, his quarry survives the bullet that lodges permanently in his right eye. Barts retaliates, but another individual, Henry Sturgess ((Dominic Cooper of ""Captain America: The First Avenger""), comes to Abe's rescue. Lincoln manages to escape, and Sturgess explains why Barts didn't bite the dust. Thereafter, Sturgess trains Lincoln in the art of killing vampires. Since our hero is an incredibly terrible marksman, he falls back onto his own weapon of preference—an ax. Lincoln accepts Sturgess' Vampires 101 tutelage, but the lessons come with a condition. Lincoln must kill other vampires who constitute a greater menace before Sturgess will allow him to dispatch with Barts.<br/><br/>Abe relocates to Springfield, Illinois, becomes a clerk in a general store and studies law in his spare time when he isn't slaying vampires. Of course, nobody can know anything about his secret. Lincoln's best laid plans backfire when Mary Todd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead of ""The Thing"") enters the store. Abe doesn't classify himself as a ladies' man so he is surprised when Mary takes an interest in him. Abe's employer and best friend, Joshua Speed (Jimmi Simpson of ""Zodiac""), wrangles them an invitation to a dance where Abe meets Mary again. Despite Henry Sturgess' warnings that Abe should shun companionship since it might interfere with his nocturnal hunting, Abe starts dating Mary. Meanwhile, Abe carries out Henry's orders and becomes such a proficient vampire killer, eventually slaughtering Jack Barts, that he arouses the wrath of the oldest of all vampires, Adam (Rufus Sewell of ""Dark City""), who lives in the South. Adam exploits Abe's friendship with William (Anthony Mackie of ""Real Steel""), who is still searching for his relatives. Adam invites Abe and William to his Louisiana Plantation, and plans to eliminate the vampire hunter. Of course, Abe thwarts Adam's plans, wipes out a number of vampires, and then marries Mary. He embarks on his prestigious career as America's president until Adam and vampires join Jefferson Davis and the Confederacy.<br/><br/>""Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter"" is the first time Hollywood has appropriated a venerable figure such as Lincoln since the 2001 spoof ""Jesus Christ, Vampire Hunter."" The concept that Lincoln carried out cold-blooded executions of vampires during the 19th century would turn anybody's head, including Mr. Lincoln. The discrepancy between the real-life warrior and his audacious literary alter-ego may be more than some audiences can overlook. Mind you, ""Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter"" doesn't turn Lincoln into a figure of ridicule. Tastefully, Bekmambetov and Grahame-Smith have refrained from covering all the tragedy in Lincoln's life during his tenure in the Oval Office. Unlike the novel, the film wraps up everything before Lincoln accompanies his wife to the Ford Theater. The writer and the director have eliminated anything that doesn't propel the action forward, and they have replaced dull scenes with exciting ones. You won't find the flaming trestle that a munitions train must cross, and the novel lacks a central villain. Happily, Rufus Sewell delivers an impeccable performance as the chief vampire villain. The vampires appear rather frightening. Bekmambetov and Grahame-Smith have conjured up some new rules that aren't universal for the genre. First, vampires can rough up other vampires, but they are not allowed to kill each other. Second, these vampires can become invisible in the blink of an eye. Third, the secret weapon that our heroes must stockpile to thwart their evil designs is silver. A human can drop a vampire stone-dead in its tracks with a silver bullet. Although it clocks in at 105 minutes, ""Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter"" never wears out its welcome."

","When you think of funny movie titles, they're really very clever. One of the main pitches to see a movie is the title, sort of like Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter. When I first heard of this movie, I got a good chuckle out of that title. My fiancé and I started talking about the sequels: JFK: Zombie Killer, FDR: Witch Slayer, Thomas Jefferson: Werewolf Killer, etc. But I couldn't resist, I had to see what this movie. I'm not sure what inspired this story, I guess Lincoln just didn't make as big a splash as most presidents. I mean he only freed the slaves, is on our American five dollar bill, made it through the civil war and was assassinated, nothing that big. So we had to add another occupation to his resume and what better occupation than what's the hottest trend right now: vampire hunter! You get what you ask for when you see this movie and that's why I'm happy.<br/><br/>In 1818, Abraham Lincoln lives in Indiana with his parents, who works at a plantation owned by Jack Barts. There, Lincoln befriends a young African American boy, William Johnson, and intervenes when he sees Johnson being beaten by a slaver. Because of his son's actions, Thomas is fired. That night, Lincoln sees Barts break into his house and attack Nancy. She falls ill the following day, and dies shortly afterwards. Nine years later, Lincoln decides to get revenge against Barts. He attacks Barts at the docks, but Barts, who is actually a vampire, overpowers him. However, before Barts can kill him, Lincoln is rescued by Henry Sturgess. Sturgess explains that vampires exist, and offers to teach Lincoln to be a vampire hunter. Lincoln accepts and, after a decade of training, travels to Springfield, Illinois. Determined for revenge, he realizes that he may have discovered more than he would want to know while the country goes into civil war and that the vampires have deeper motives rather than just slavery.<br/><br/>I love history very much, my head is like a sponge that just loves to take information in and I love to study everything about history. So I've seen pictures of Lincoln and his wife Mary, both very good people, but not exactly the lookers of the day. Benjamin Walker, who plays Lincoln and people are calling the young Liam Neeson, does a great job of playing the part but doesn't really look like Lincoln, though he is the closest ironically. But the performance is what makes him memorable. Mary Elizabeth Winstead plays Mary, his wife, she's thin, gorgeous and complete opposite of who Mary was, but still does very well. Now this film is by no means for historical context, I just thought it was funny in the looks department that they pick models to play the average looking people. The action is great and a lot of scenes are very intense and scary. The make up effects for the vampires were great and very intimidating. Everything about this film is really silly when you think in the historical context, but if you just let go, it's honestly fun. Plus, in some sick way, I think this would've been cool if Lincoln was really this bad-ass. He's the original Blade and can really hold himself well against the evil gang of vampire slave owners. You get what you expect and I don't know what else to say for those who are complaining that this movie is too stupid or not historically accurate, it's just a movie. The title explains all, the story is good and the actors had great chemistry and made it work. I'm looking forward to seeing it again, it was a fun horror movie with a good historical twist.<br/><br/>7/10"

"knowyourmovie","7","2","5","3 July 2012"," A worthy effort wasted on an unworthy cause..
","""Abraham Lincoln: VampireHunter"" was strangely able to awake a peculiar mix of very different, conflicting emotions in me. Excitement and satisfaction on one side and sadness and discontent on the other kept me overwhelmed for a while. Eventually, the latter won and I had to face the hard truth that almost drove me into a rather painful melancholy.<br/><br/>There was no way around that. I had to admit to myself that ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" is an elegant nonsense, a professionally made nullity, an exciting shallowness, a worthy effort for an unworthy cause.<br/><br/>Irrespective to its ultimate worth, the movie turned out to be well done professionally.<br/><br/>The script was adequate to the task. The story had a solid literary source in its foundation – the SethGrahame-Smith's mash-up novel with the same name. It even featured some character development - a rarity for a mainstream Hollywood movie nowadays.<br/><br/>The only truly silly and incredibly cheesy scene in the ""Abraham Lincoln: VampireHunter"" happened closer to the beginning of the movie and somehow even made it into the trailer. Fortunately, my fear that the rest of the film would continue along the same dangerously ludicrous lines turned out to be unfounded.<br/><br/>The interesting and provocative concept was implemented skillfully and effectively and the sensitive historical subject was treated carefully, in a graceful manner, with a good taste and a proper respect.<br/><br/>The directing, the casting and the acting in ""Abraham Lincoln: VampireHunter"" mostly did not disappoint.<br/><br/>Timur Bekmambetov was able to repeat both the professional and the box office success of his 2008 movie ""Wanted"" by producing and directing an above-average action flick that kept the audience excited and entertained until the very end.<br/><br/>Rufus Sewell was good as usual in the role of the chief vampire Adam, creating an original vivid character that nicely blended charisma, style, and self-irony. In my opinion, however, Sewell's Adam was not fascinating enough for an ancient demonic creature who was supposed to be a thousands years old ancestor of all vampires. I cannot help but thinking about the Bill Nighy's magnificent Viktor from the ""Underworld"" movie series whose immense charisma by far exceeded everything that Sewell's Adam could possibly offer.<br/><br/>A similar charge can be held against Dominic Cooper, whose Henry Sturgess was charming yet too lightweight for a mysterious stranger responsible for first saving Abraham Lincoln's life and then initiating him into the secret order of the powerful vampire hunters. <br/><br/>My personal favorite was Marton Csokas in the role of Jack Barts – a nasty, cunning, and ruthless vampire, responsible for the death of Abraham Lincoln's mother in the movie. Marton Csokas played his relatively small role masterfully, and, similarly to Sewell, employed a so appropriate strong touch of self-irony in his performance. The chase scene with Abraham Lincoln furiously pursuing Jack Barts to get his long-awaited and earned through much suffering revenge was arguably the best scene in the whole movie.<br/><br/>Overall, the fight scenes in the ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" were done very well. They were imaginative, original, colorful - far superior to the dull monotonous back and forth clashing in ""The Avengers"".<br/><br/>Portraying the 16th President of the United States was without a question the most difficult acting task in the movie. While the rest of the cast had much more freedom in impersonating their characters, the actor playing Abraham Lincoln for obvious reasons faced various constraints in order to remain true to the historical image. He, for example, could not afford the luxury of self-irony widely employed by the rest of the cast. Nevertheless, previously little known Benjamin Walker passed the tough acting test with flying colors and delivered a multifaceted, nuanced performance that powerfully reflected the character development. His Abraham Lincoln was both likable and believable at various stages of life – from youth to maturity.<br/><br/>A promising talent Mary Elizabeth Winstead, whom some of you might remember for her strong lead performance in ""The Thing"" was nearly perfect in ""Abraham Lincoln: VampireHunter"" as Mary Todd Lincoln. Her small but warm and touching role became a nice addition to the movie ensemble dominated by the violent male characters.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I cannot say the same about Erin Wasson whose unimpressive performance essentially ruined the potentially very interesting character of Vadona - the dangerous and sinister Adam's sister.<br/><br/>Finally, the solid original music score by Henry Jackman (""X-Men: First Class"") was a first-class citizen in the movie, easily flowing from the lyric heights to the dramatic depths to the violent rage of the fights and chases.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" decisively surpassed the far more popular ""The Avengers"" in almost every area, except maybe the special effects.<br/><br/>""The Avengers"" was an unworthy effort wasted on an unworthy cause. The only true valuables spent in vain on ""The Avengers"" were time and money. There was no good script, or directing, or acting, or music to be sorry about.<br/><br/>""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" on the other hand had many good, redeeming qualities including the script, the directing, the acting, the music, and the humor. For that very reason it is truly regrettable when such a worthy effort is wasted on such an unworthy, hollow, and disposable subject as ""vampire hunting"".<br/><br/>knowyourmovie.blogspot.com"

"Kate_Ali","6","2","5","24 June 2012"," Despite it's flaws, the movie is still entertaining
","If your problem with Quentin Tarantino's alternate-history World War II action flick ""Inglourious Basterds"" was that it lacked enough high concept, then ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" is for you. When I discovered this movie, skepticism washed over me. I mean, Abraham Lincoln as a vampire hunter? It turned out much better than expected and a fun film filled with lots of violence, blood, gore, and vampire decapitations. his vampire hunting career reaches a hiatus in the middle of a movie where Abraham is now interested in pursuing a career in politics. In the end, he becomes the President of the United States, only to have his career troubled by the devastating Civil War where vampires play a part in it somehow.<br/><br/>In the twenty or so minutes that focus on his presidency, I felt there was an issue with it as it shifted the focus of vampire hunting and focused on politics and the Civil War instead as nothing about vampires was stated during this that time. The vampires are led by Adam (cliche'?). Although he might appear to be the strongest, I felt that the vampire John Barts was actually the main antagonist of the film and represented a bigger threat. While Adam had a lengthy climax, the fight with John Barts was much longer and was more personal. After all, He did kill Abraham's mother. Talking about action scenes, they were all brilliant. They were energetic, full of blood, gore, extremely violent, and dead brutal. Most of them featuring decapitations of the vampires and anyone seeking brutality, deadliness, blood, gore, and violence should be satisfied with them.<br/><br/>The script was a bit uneven. While the second half of the film was a bit better, I felt that the first half of the film was a bit lacking in dialog. There was little talk and there was too many decapitations, blood, and gore. I felt that the scenes progressed too fast and they should have taken it more slowly. You're building a bloody world here, not some panto. In fact, most of the talk in the first part of the film comes from Abraham, due in part to the narration of fragments of his diary. The others rarely talk and probably only talk so little and it's only by the second half that they talk more. However, the performances by the actors were okay, not too terrible to burden the overall movie experience.<br/><br/>There also seemed to be a bit of a disaster with the make-up. Since the time in the story spans from Abraham's early adulthood to his fifties, we could clearly see a change in his facial appearance (a beard). We can also see this change with Abraham's friend Joshua Speed. The same cannot be said with Abraham's wife Mary Todd, and Abraham's other friend Will Johnson. Mary Todd doesn't appear to change with the exception of very few creases on her face whereas Will Johnson doesn't have a change in appearance at all. His face is exactly the same his hair didn't even turn white.<br/><br/>However,this was one of the few times I can say that the 3D was excellent. It takes you in and makes you part of the scenes and is recommended although some of the scenes would make the 3D a nuisance. But other scenes where there is blood will be enhanced by the 3D and some of the blood may even squirt out to your face. And the visual effects! Oh they're such a wonder. But of course, impressive visual effects and eye-catching stunts would be what you would expect from a movie directed by Timur Bekmambetov.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" is a film that offers moviegoers a fun time with plenty of bloody and gory action sequences filled with eye-catching stunts, impressive visual effects and excellent 3D effects. Despite the interesting plot, the film is downed by some poor unclear shots, an uneven script that mostly focused on action, not on dialog, and poor make-up. Regardless, ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" is a movie you should see if you want a bloody fun time.<br/><br/>There's definitely some empty-calories, summer-movie fun to be found in this ludicrous genre mash-up, most of it courtesy of maniacal Russian director Timur Bekmambetov, who stages hilarious, imaginative, almost free-form action sequences like nobody in the business. There's a scene in this movie that involves an ax fight between the young Mr. Lincoln and a slave-trading vampire mastermind, set amid a stampeding herd of horses, who are alternately used as conveyances, obstacles and weapons. In its own idiotic and limited way, it's a work of genius, and you could almost say that about the movie as a whole."

","OK, I get that this is suppose to a fictional movie and that huge literary license had to be used to try and make this a movie, but that being said let me warn you that this mindless junk doesn't even begin to come close to anything anyone could call entertainment. Hey I like vampire movies, who doesn't like a scary eerie movie every now and then, but this stupid effort not only doesn't scare you to death it bores you to death. The acting is terrible, the writing is pathetic, the directing is juvenile, and the production sets are laughable. But wait, you ask what about the special effects? Well, if watching a toy train run around on the tracks entertains you, then maybe this movie is for you after all. Let me end by saying life is way to short to waste your time on this truly miserable movie, save your time and save your money for something much more fun like root canal surgery which would of been way better than wasting time on this hunk of junk."

","Good Story line, great graphics. Decent representation of Lincoln during the serious parts even though it was obviously fictitious. Suspend your disbelief for 2 hours and enjoy it.

Frightful looking vampires with awesome bloody decapitation from our hero. Costumes and makeup are well presented here for the era and character/role. Explosions, special effects, cgi backgrounds were adequate. Best scene: burning bridge and train was spectacular. All actors played their part with adequate portral of their roles. So, if you are looking for a no brainer action sequence movie, this is it.

"HildyJohnson","2","2","6","14 September 2012"," A note on violence
","In all the reviews I've read here, none seems to mention one basic thing: the explicit cartoon-style violence of the film. I know that's the whole point of the film, I know it's a parallel world, and I know it's supposed to be comic-like, but the constant slow-mo beheadings and blood splattering are nauseating. I've clearly seen too few of these kinds of movies and am equally clearly old-fashioned. But to read reviews saying ""it's boring"" or ""the action is fun"" – have we become so completely jaded that we think killing sprees are a bit of fun (yes, I know it's like a cartoon, yes, I know Lincoln's slaying evil in the film - I'm talking about the principle of the thing)? Are we so blasé that we need even more gore to be stimulated into feeling anything?"
"eschetic-2","7","2","6","1 July 2012"," A surprisingly satisfying ""alternate history"" adventure
","I read the book almost on a dare, but was surprised to find that the author had put in almost as much solid research as Doris Kearns Goodwin, the author of the definitive Lincoln work ""Team of Rivals,"" to make his background solid. The film mostly lives up to the book and with or without the trashy/fun overlay of the supernatural admirably depicts the LOOK and feel of America in the mid-19th Century.<br/><br/>While some admirable elements (like the frame) of the book are passed over, with the exception of the few White House scenes where only one Lincoln child is mentioned, the Cabinet is ignored and Lincoln's actual two white secretaries, Nicolay and Hay, are conflated into one black friend of the President's, most of the actual historical figures are more than fairly painted even as the film starts to drift from the tight structure of the book toward the end.<br/><br/>Over all the film is a fun ""alternate history"" which ironically does bring the actual issue of slavery back into an examination of the Civil War. We came away (and the friend who went with me had not read the book) having found the film exceptionally well cast, acted and directed and immensely satisfying. Most satisfying of all, the more solid knowledge of history you HAVE, the more you'll enjoy the film, although it plays well merely as adventure. Benjamin Walker's Lincoln - he made a notable mark on Broadway last season playing a ""Bloody, Bloody (President) Andrew Jackson"" - is particularly good, blending a credible young Lincoln with the more ingrained popular image from the penny. If the film has a fault, it is over produced in places (the burning bridge scene) - but to criticize it for that would be like damning GONE WITH THE WIND for the ""burning of Atlanta"" scene going on too long! Mark it as something better than a guilty pleasure. Too many of the print critics heard the concept and assumed it had to be a campy spoof like Roman Polanski's THE FEARLESS VAMPIRE SLAYERS or PLEASE TAKE YOUR FANGS OUT OF MY NECK - and seemed upset that it wasn't. Go for what it IS, and you'll have a very good time."
"gregsrants","5","2","6","24 June 2012"," Good, But Fails to Meet High Expectations
","I have long been a fan of director Timur Bekmanbetov's work. I was lucky enough to see his 2004 film Night Watch on the festival circuit that year and I was immediately taken by the visual styles and effects that Bekmanbetov brought to the screen. My admiration continued when Timur worked on his first English language film, Wanted, starring Angelina Jolie and Morgan Freeman. The film was hokey (a loom - really?) but the effects and action sequences were enough to drive the film to a $350 million worldwide gross.<br/><br/>I was excited then to see him attached to the adaptation of Seth Grahmae-Smith's novel Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter. I hadn't read the book, but just the idea behind the title and Bekmanbetov's involvement were enough to ensure my opening week-end attendance.<br/><br/>The premise is neither complicated nor historical. The film opens with the introduction of a young Abraham Lincoln who witnesses his mother being bit and subsequently dying at the fangs of a vampire. We flash forward many years and Abe is a travelling assassin looking to bring justice to the undead blood sucker who took his mother's life. But his first confrontation is more than what the young would-be President can handle and only thanks to the intervening of Henry Sturgess (Dominic Cooper) does he survive the encounter.<br/><br/>In a quick and forced moment during his recovery, Abe learns that there are countless vampires – particularly in the Southern United States – and he agrees to heed the advice and follow the rules of the knowledgeable Henry in an effort to help rid the world of vampires one blood sucker at a time.<br/><br/>Time continues to pass and we watch as Abe falls in love with Mary Todd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), becomes President of the United States and challenges both his constituents in abolishing slavery while strategizing against the vampire presence lead by head vampire Adam (Rufus Sewell) and the deadly wonderful Vadoma (Erin Wasson).<br/><br/>Abraham Lincoln – Vampire Hunter is being released in the highly contested summer blockbuster season so expectations for both a rewarding return on the production investment and a potential franchise are on the block. There is plenty of good in Timur's tale to warrant praise. A scene where Abraham Lincoln and vampire Jack Barts (Marton Csokas) chase and fight amongst a stampede of wild horses was a highlight. So too was a finale that included a speeding train and a wooden bridge set afire.<br/><br/>As the adult Abraham Lincoln, actor Benjamin Walker, is believable as an axe wielding vampire killer with a grudge to settle. But he doesn't command the same dominant presence when the movie shifts to more of the political undertones of the 1800's.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the film has just as many negatives as it does positive to result in only a moderate recommendation. Henry Sturgess' character is a tad underwritten, and the final confrontation between Abraham Lincoln and Sewell's Adam is anti-climactic and over far too easily.<br/><br/>Many of the action sequences are well choreographed. But the slow-motion revolving camera technique that then speeds up right before a blow is administered is repeated a little too often and offers nothing new in terms action ingenuity.<br/><br/>It felt as if the final third of the film was dragging and at 105 minutes and I could have easily have suggested cuts in the editing room to chew off some fat. Abraham Lincoln – Vampire Hunter therefore ends up being a bit of a disappointment. It boasted a $70 million production budget. It had Tim Burton listed as a Producer. And it had Timur Bekmanbetov at the helm and his unique vision in bringing action sequences to the large screen. But with all these factors combined, the movie failed to arouse anything in me outside of a mild understanding that my time was not completely wasted and I at least enjoyed my experience even if I wasn't circling the internet search engines with high anticipation for a continuance in the story.<br/><br/>www.killerreviews.com"
"Chris_Pandolfi","6","2","6","22 June 2012"," It Seems Abe Wasn't as Honest As We Thought
","""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter."" Don't you just love a title that plainly spells it all out for you? Say it to yourself, and you're instantly reminded of the sci-fi/horror B-movies that sounded as if they were christened before an actual screenplay was written, like ""Attack of the 50 Foot Woman"" or ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"" or ""Attack of the Crab Monsters."" It matters not that the film plays fast and loose with American history. If anything, that will probably make it much more palatable for most audiences, myself included. Why bother with a straight historical drama? History doesn't interest me. But a supernatural thriller, now there's something I can really get into. Such movies have the excitement and imagination that can never be found within the pages of an encyclopedia.<br/><br/>The problem lies not with the creative liberties that were taken. It lies in the fact that the filmmakers made the mistake of taking the material seriously. When you have a title like ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,"" there really is no point in trying to formulate clever parallels between vampirism and the atrocities of slavery and the Civil War. Screenwriter Seth Grahame-Smith, who adapted his own mashup novel of the same name, was aiming for satire when the innate silliness of the premise dictated that he should have been aiming for pure camp. There are times when it comes close to that, but for the most part, it plays it straight and operates under the assumption that we should accept it on those terms. Forget about the fact that this is difficult to achieve. It might actually be impossible.<br/><br/>Unfolding for the most part as an extended flashback sequence, this film paints a revisionist portrait of the sixteenth President of the United States, one that happens to be in eye-popping 3D. We're shown that all of the well-documented aspects of his life, from his boyhood days as a frontier axeman to his older days as a law student to his final days as the leader of the free world, were in fact touched in some way by the evil world of vampires, of which there were thousands during the mid nineteenth century. Lincoln wasn't initially aware of this. As a boy (Lux Haney-Jardine), he witnessed his mother (Robin McLeavy) get ill and die after being attacked in bed by a ruthless slave owner named Jack Barts (Marton Csokas) and vowed to take his revenge; nine years later, as an adult (Benjamin Walker), he makes an attempt on Bart's life, only to then discover that he was in fact an undead blood sucker.<br/><br/>It's through this confrontation that Lincoln becomes acquainted with a British man named Henry Sturgess (Dominic Cooper), who, for reasons the filmmakers made no attempt to keep hidden, knows all too well the reality of the existence of vampires. He reluctantly agrees to teach Lincoln in the ways of vampire hunting; this means he will turn Lincoln into a cross between an action hero and a video game character, paving the way for many violent, frenetic stunt and special effects sequences that involve a lot of slow motion. Sturgess informs Lincoln that a vampire hunter must refrain from forming close personal relationships, as they will almost certainly lead to heartbreak. He also warns that this can't simply be about vengeance; Lincoln must systematically hunt his way through a series of vampires hidden all throughout the Midwest and ultimately work up to the head vampire, Adam (Rufus Sewell), a New Orleans-based slave owner.<br/><br/>Once in Springfield, Lincoln immediately breaks Sturgess' first rule, befriending a shopkeeper named Joshua Speed (Jimmi Simpson) and falling in love with Mary Todd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), the former fiancée of local politician Stephen A. Douglas (Alan Tudyk). Into Lincoln's life reenters his boyhood friend, an escaped slave named William Johnson (Anthony Mackie), who now helps other slaves escape through the Underground Railroad and needs help evading bounty hunters. From this, we begin to see the misguided satirical machinery at work; Lincoln soon enters politics and speaks out against slavery, which is being perpetuated in large part because slaves are a food source for Southern vampires, who in turn want the right to exist. This inevitably leads to the Civil War, during which, not surprisingly, the Confederacy tries to gain the upper hand by recruiting vampires as soldiers.<br/><br/>It's unlikely that general audiences will care or even know about the historical references Smith so freely manipulates. They will, however, respond to the music video-like action sequences, during which Lincoln flies through the air like an acrobat and wields a special silver-coated axe with the flair of a samurai. There are also a lot of exposed fangs and beheadings. Surprisingly, there's no mention of wooden stakes or garlic cloves, and it seems Smith has envisioned vampires as immune to sunlight. There's also an assortment of vampire rules that really have no bearing on the plot but are fun to hear about nonetheless. Indeed, parts of ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" work well as escapist entertainment. The rest of it is mired by its own sense of purpose. We needed a movie, not a historical send-up.<br/><br/>-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)"
"freemantle_uk","6","2","6","22 June 2012"," The untold story of Abraham Lincoln
","With the title Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter and Wanted director Timur Bekmambetov bringing his highly stylized approach, here is a movie that really wants a cult audience. It'll be an uphill battle, as it frustrates as much as it satisfies.<br/><br/>As a young boy, Abraham Lincoln (Benjamin Walker) saw two of the biggest blights on humanity: slavery and vampirism. It was personified in the form of his father's boss, Jack Barts (Marton Csokas). After his father (Joseph Mawle) is unable to pay his debts, Jack kills Lincoln's mother (Robin McLeavy) in front of him. Hungry for revenge, a skilled vampire hunter named Henry Struges (Dominic Cooper) teaches Lincoln about vampires and how to kill them using an axe lined with silver. In Springfield, Illinois, Abraham is given targets to kill as he studies to be a lawyer, but his quest evolves from a mission of vengeance to a ideological one to rid the world of slavery and vampires as his political career grows alongside his vampire-hunting exploits.<br/><br/>Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter delivers on the action, which is when it's most inventive and fun. Bekmambetov gives us a bloody experience as Lincoln decapitates his way through vampires and swings his axe in such slow motion that Zack Snyder would be embarrassed. Bekmambetov knows how to shoot an action scene and the fight choreography was top notch, though the editing in some scenes was a bit too choppy (no pun intended) and hard to follow. Bekmambetov also employs a very direct use of 3D as he points guns and blades in your face, but much of it was blurry and unfocused as with most poor post-conversions.<br/><br/>Sadly, the $70-million budget was all too clear. The CGI replacements were rather obvious and the Battle of Gettysberg was very limited in scope, taking away the epic feeling one would expect from such an iconic battle. A horse stampede was also ruined by the weak CGI and choppy editing.<br/><br/>Seth Grahame-Smith adapted his own novel here and he has in fact come up with some interesting ideas on vampirism to add to the already rich lore, like why silver is so effective on vampires, why they cannot kill another vampire and how they are able to stand the sunlight.<br/><br/>But at the same time the screenplay has problems. The first half of the movie was fun and action-packed but when Lincoln becomes more involved in politics it starts to take itself way too seriously. You can't make serious points about racism and slavery when the man making them has been hacking creatures of the night to death. The film needed to loosen up and have more fun with its premise.<br/><br/>As a character Lincoln does evolve from wanting revenge to widening his crusade against a menace, but he story is sluggish at times and skips major moments of his life, fast-forwarding to when he becomes president. It felt like large chunks of the movie were missing and some character actions just happen out of the blue. Hopefully this will result in a director's cut home release.<br/><br/>Judging Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter as a historical piece would be an exercise in foolishness, but I will say this: for a movie that treats the issues of racism and slavery with dead seriousness, it is hard to believe the portrayals of friendly relations between the races at times.<br/><br/>Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter serves as Walker's first major movie role, so quite the undertaking for a rookie. He was strongest in full presidential mode, making his grant speeches and leading his nation, but early on he was a bland hero who disappears off the screen compared to the more colourful Cooper (who had a very interesting The Crow-like back story) who seemed to have more fun with his role. Rufus Sewell plays a villain who lacked any real menace or fear and Csokas gave a messy, scenery-chewing performance not helped by some of the film's worst dialogue. As the romantic lead, Mary Elizabeth Winstead is adequate, giving Mary Todd Lincoln plenty of charm.<br/><br/>Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is sadly a cheap-looking movie that took itself too seriously, but it is certainly not the worst vampire movie ever made. Stylized action fans will take some enjoyment from it, but it's not going to be the cult hit it strives to be.<br/><br/>5.5/10 Please visit www.playeraffinity.com"

I invited some friends over the laugh at it, but one of them said they saw it before, and it was a good flick. And, boy, it sure was. With amazing action, and pretty good special effects, it was just amazing. With pretty good special effects, and a whole bunch of gore, it was (still) just amazing. I like how they kept some rules of regular vampires (like one undead cannot kill another) and added there own special touch to it( like silver being there weakness). Another thing I liked was how it sort-of stayed true to the original life of Abraham. But maybe that's just my nerd/geek side showing.

Instead what I watched was a ridiculous mashup of """"serious"""" Lincoln scenes, exploring his life (maybe not accurately) but with real scenes. And between those moments we got the ridiculous, but expected given the title, scenes where we find out he's more than a political figure growing and finding love, but a Vampire Hunter. After that we switch back to the """"serious"""" scene, and we repeat the cicle.<br/><br/>And that's when it lost me. As soon as we got serious scenes, relatively well acted, without jokes (that I was aware off) and without a hint of irony (again, that was my impression), the movie completely lost me. Benjamin Walker was """"too good"""" for this movie to work. Im pretty sure that's what the directors wanted out of him, but it was a bad decision. He was an imposing figure with a serious face acting as much as he could the weight of his """"growing love"""" and """"passion for his country"""". And yet those scenes were followed by him talking to a random exposition guy about the need for killing the vampires. It just didn't work. I was bored with the serious scenes and baffled by the admittedly good action scenes.<br/><br/>In the end, I don't hate this movie, It's a kind of ridicoulness that do not works with me, where the """"joke"""" is the action/blood and not actual jokes or sarcastic/ironic hits at history. But I guess I can understand why some might like and even love the movie."

"melakudessie77","Null","1","2","10 December 2014"," great movie
","When I discovered this movie, skepticism washed over me. I mean, Abraham Lincoln as a vampire hunter? Having one of the greatest presidents of all time as the character of a vampire hunter would be the last thing anyone would expect. When I entered the theater, my initial thought was that this movie would bring me disappointment. But it turned out to be much better than expected and a fun film filled with lots of violence, blood, gore, and vampire decapitations. So, in the film adaptation of Seth Grahame-Smith's fantasy novel, Abraham Lincoln is a vampire hunter. But before he becomes that, he's just an ordinary boy living in a world consumed by slavery. One night, his mom died from an undiscovered disease and from then on, he's waited and searched for his mom's killer, only to discover a new large world of vampires. There he becomes a vampire hunter under the guidance of Henry Sturges (who has a secret). However, his vampire hunting career reaches a hiatus in the middle of a movie where Abraham is now interested in pursuing a career in politics. In the end, he becomes the President of the United States, only to have his career troubled by the devastating Civil War where vampires play a part in it somehow. In the 20 or so minutes that focus on his presidency, I felt there was an issue with it as it shifted the focus of vampire hunting and focused on politics and the Civil War instead as nothing about vampires was stated during this 20 minutes. The vampires are led by a leader named Adam. Although he might appear to be the strongest, I felt that the vampire John Barts (killer of Abraham's mother) was actually the main antagonist of the film and represented a bigger threat. While Adam had a lengthy climax, the fight with John Barts was much longer and was more personal as only the two of them were involved and more engaging. The scene also displayed more of the abilities possessed by a vampire. Talking about action scenes, they were all great and fantastic. They were energetic, full of blood, full of gore, extremely violent, and dead brutal. Most of them feature decapitations of the vampires and anyone seeking brutality, deadliness, blood, gore, and violence should be satisfied with the action scenes provided here. But what I noticed in the action scenes, particularly the Lincoln-Barts fight and parts of the climax, was that it was quite unclear. In the Lincoln-Barts fight, the two were in a sandy place with many horses galloping. I felt that there was too much sand flying around and the fight became unclear and a bit brownish. This made it hard to see what was going on. It might intentionally done like that to give it more of an old feeling but it may also be a distraction because you don't know what's going on. The same happened in parts of the climax but this time, smoke and sparks caused it. The script was a bit uneven. While the second half of the film was a bit better, I felt that the first half of the film was a bit lacking in dialog. There was little talk and there was too many decapitations, blood, and gore. I felt that the scenes progressed too fast and they should have taken it more patiently. In fact, most of the talk in the first part of the film comes from Abraham, due in part to the narration of fragments of his diary. The others rarely talk and probably only talk so little and it's only by the second half that they talk more. However, the performances by the actors were okay, not too terrible to burden the overall movie experience. I also felt there was a bit of a disaster with the make-up. Since the time in the story spans from Abraham's early adulthood to his fifties, we could clearly see a change in his facial appearance (a beard). We can also see this change with Abraham's friend Joshua Speed. The same cannot be said with Abraham's wife Mary Todd, and Abraham's other friend Will Johnson. Mary Todd doesn't appear to change with the exception of very few creases on her face whereas Will Johnson doesn't have a change in appearance at all. His face is exactly the same his hair didn't even turn white. However, the 3D was excellent. It takes you and makes you part of the scenes and is recommended although some of the scenes would make the 3D a nuisance. But other scenes where there is blood will be enhanced by the 3D and some of the blood may even squirt out to your face. And the visual effects! Oh they're such a wonder. But of course, impressive visual effects and eye-catching stunts would be what you would expect from a movie directed by Timur Bekmambetov. Overall, ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" is a film that offers moviegoers a fun time with plenty of bloody and gory action sequences filled with eye-catching stunts, impressive visual effects and excellent 3D effects. Despite the interesting plot, the film is downed by some poor unclear shots, an uneven script that mostly focused on action, not on dialog, and poor make-up. Regardless, ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" is a movie you should see if you want a bloody fun time. <br/><br/>If you like science fiction this is the movie for you. I would recommend for 15 years and above. Form my point of view this is a good movie ever directed and made. This is the best Sic-fi thriller movie. When rating this movie, it deserver's a 8 out of 10 because of its realistic features. I am undergraduate studying international business form China gave the following review.

I liked how we got to see him in the different stages of his life; a beardless Abe in his twenties as he's taken under wing and taught how to kill vampires, becoming a hunter and in his fifties as president when the bloodsuckers side with the confederates, threatening to take over the country and win the war. As I said the special effects are awesome (the fight scene atop the herd of horses, the train via the burning bridge among others.) It almost takes on a Matrix-y quality in the way the fight scenes have been shot, all slow-mo flying through the air, just stunning. The acting is also good, the costumes and sets true to the period. A big surprise hit for me. 9/23/14"

","So stupid it actually worked! When I bought this movie I thought it would be awful or good. No in between! Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is about the 16th President's secret life as a vampire hunter. The story line where vampires were in the South and used slavery for a steady blood supply. Vampires or the undead were trying to take over the United States. Abe chose to battle the undead. What worked was the fictional events woven into historical facts. The characters were interesting and Abe was likable. Abe is an axe wielding, smart, and has backwoods charm. Without ruining the movie, Abe with his cohorts, went on a secret mission to save the Union with some exciting C G I effects. A memorable ending. Worth watching."

"g-bodyl","9","1","2","14 January 2014"," Fun and Entertaining For What It Is!
","As a fun summer popcorn movie, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is good at what it's supposed to be doing: to entertain. Despite such an outlandish concept, the movie works because it's so fun to watch. I mean who never thought about the beloved President killing supernatural creatures. I think it's a crazy, but fun idea that works for the most part. Yes, it takes itself a little too seriously, but it has great CGI, a wonderfully-crafted script, plenty of action, and the film just tells a untold, different history of the United States.<br/><br/>Based of the entertaining book by Seth-Graeme Smith, Timur Bekmambetov's film tells us the untold story about our 16th President. After seeing his mother get killed by a vampire, Lincoln seeks the help of a Henry Sturgess to learn how to kill vampires. As President, he realizes the Confederacy has vampires and he has an agenda to defeat them.<br/><br/>The acting is actually pretty good for the type of film it is. I didn't think Benjamin Walker could pull this role off. I'm still a little iffy, but he did better than I thought. Dominic Cooper and Rufus Sewell were good in their respective roles. Mary Elizabeth Winstead makes a really good Mary Todd Lincoln.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a decent summer fare that is nothing but fun. Anything that has Lincoln killing vampires, I'd watch anyday. Of course, this film is not going to be historically accurate but should clarify that for people's sake. The CGI is effective and the vampires seemed rather realistic and pretty scary. There is lots of action and the final thirty minutes has some great scenes involving vampires and a train. I think the book is better but not a bad film adaptation. I rate this film 9/10."

","I had no expectations for this movie. I anticipated something fairly ridiculous. Much to my surprise, this has become one of my favorite movies. I give it a 10 out of 10. It has everything I want in a movie - appealing main characters, reasonably scary bad guys, a sexy good guy vamp,a good weaving of the supernatural elements into the historical backdrop. I love the action sequences, both on the Civil War battlefields and the scenes of Abe taking out vampires. I also loved the friendship and family moments. The only part that felt slightly over the top was the herd of horses battle sequence. I thought it went on a bit long and didn't seem that necessary to the movie. Everything else I loved! The movie manages to make the premise plausible without taking anything away from Abraham Lincoln's gravitas as a significant historical figure in American history."

","I watched this on TV and didn't expect much. I don't like period dramas or anything that may be historical but to my pleasant surprise, this story was interesting and fast paced throughout. I don't understand the low ratings, unless you're into stuff that's 100% like real life, but the point of this story was to set it in a time where vampires could be plausible. I.E. when shooting someone, you can get away with it because there's no DNA evidence and such. The casting was good and the storyline had a couple of fresh ideas thrown in to make it better and add to the quality of the film, with twists. I think anyone seeking out a good film should try it, because it has a good mixture of violence and real reasons behind that violence in the form of vengeance."
"mbh42498","9","1","2","24 May 2013"," Why all the hate? Never payed attention during History class?
","I actually thought this movie was an exciting backstory of President Lincoln. It is a very original concept making a president centuries ago a superhero. Important parts are also highlighted from Civil War textbooks also which is very educational for 2nd graders to see.<br/><br/>The story is similar to that of Blade. What I do like about Lincoln though is that all he has is an axe of silver and his friend firing silver bullets. Lincoln is also not enabled with special abilities as he is ""only human"" and the vampires here can disappear. Blade was made by Marvel to be the action packed Buffy with a guy shooting guns without even looking at his targets and has super endurance and strength. Our hero is first introduced by the teacher and becomes pro after his first few battles. He then avenges his mother and goes for the real villain. Lincoln finds out about his mentor's past, gets a friend's help in his battles and is taught of isolation. What makes this interesting is that the creators of this movie made it as realistic to this time period as possible. It makes the Civil War Era more fascinating to watch.<br/><br/>I do love the historical references. The Underground Railroad, the death of his child, and the ride to the theater at the end.<br/><br/>The vampire cannot kill vampires thing is a bit of a joke for me since Blade is so accomplished. Then again it makes it that much more of a challenge knowing that an ordinary human must be trained diligently to defeat even one vampire with something like an axe.<br/><br/>The fight scenes are pretty appealing for me. The constant slow-mo and twirling of an axe just makes you want to do the same.<br/><br/>If you go on Watch32.com, you can watch the movie for free without downloading. I saw Lincoln on here since I was too lazy to pay 10 bucks for a ticket. I'm not lying. No viruses and has decent quality. Be sure to check out because I'll go and watch Lincoln again"

So when this Movie decides to portray Slavery and that of its Southern supporters analogous to the Fictional parasites, it all makes perfect sense and is not a conceited prejudice.<br/><br/>Mostly garnering lukewarm and outright indignation this CGI saturated Movie is somewhat underrated as it delivers what is promised. A blood splattering spoof that is nothing if not a bold amalgamation of Heroic American Icons and the enduring Undead. It is quite a treat for the insatiable masses that love this kind of Digital Cinema. All of it is unabashedly unrestrained and relentlessly presented in all its Ultra-Slow-Motion glory.<br/><br/>This becomes truly amazing in the second half as things get really expanded with the Civil War, Lincoln's Presidency and two outlandishly over-the-top scenes of outrageous eye candy. The horse chase and the train chase. It all works in a see if you can top this kind of fun. The battle scenes also open up the creative carnage.

"p-jonsson","7","1","2","12 January 2013"," Bizarre story, enjoyable movie
","I was somewhat prepared to be disappointed by this movie due to its rather bizarre title and story but to my enjoyment I wasn't. I found it to be a quite enjoyable movie.<br/><br/>The story is somewhat bizarre indeed, but then what would you expect when Tim Burton has stuck his fingers into the production? The blurb about the film is also not exactly correct. The 16th president doesn't discover that vampires are planning to take over the United States. It's more on the line that he enters politics and actually becomes the 16th President because of the vampires. The story also manages to, more or less, blame the slave trade on the vampires. After all, slaves would make a nice food source for plantation-owning vampires wouldn't it? As I said, the story is indeed somewhat bizarre.<br/><br/>The film as a whole is quite enjoyable though. Well, I guess you have to like vampire/action movies in order to find it enjoyable but then, why else would you want to see this movie in the first place? There's enough action to keep the film going most of the time. If anything, maybe the training parts were a bit rushed and too short. The action is quite well done, reasonably blood-splattering, and fun to watch. The axe-swinging Abraham Lincoln is a cool twist instead of the usual wooden stake, cross swinging or dart throwing vampire hunters that we're used to see. He must be bloody, as in unnaturally, strong to be able swing around that axe the way he does but what the heck, it's a vampire movie after all, so one should perhaps not nit-pick on such things.<br/><br/>There's a scene near the end of the film where a train is about to crash down into a ravine since the bridge, that the vampires have set on fire, is about to collapse. That's scene was a bit silly and overly unrealistic. There's also a fairly big whoops in the make-up department where Abraham and his friend Joshua clearly has aged a lot towards the end of the movie, which you would expect, but his wife and his friend Will seems not to have aged at all. How that managed to slip through is somewhat unbelievable."
"piratecannon","4","1","2","26 December 2012"," Choppin' and Droppin'
","I read the Seth Grahame-Smith novel that Vampire Hunter is based on a year or so ago on a whim. I was shocked to find it an engrossing piece of writing that skillfully blended an off-beat version of horror mythology with the multi-faceted political climate that defined American during the Civil War. What's more, the protagonist—none other than Abraham Lincoln himself—was a vulnerable character; one that seemed every bit as flawed as Joe Schmo next door. He'd loved and lost, and any nobler purposes that have defined him as a historical legend were cast aside to reveal his true passion in life: vengeance.<br/><br/>Chalk it up to the quirky title or the ridiculous juxtaposition, but the novel was a near instant success. As is usually the case in these situations, spinning the book into a feature film was inevitable. I was well aware going into the theater that much would have to be sacrificed to make the thing watchable (and to maintain a reasonable run time), but I was shocked to see that the subtlety of the novel had been shredded in favor of bullet-time action sequences—the sort that hurl you from one location to the next without allowing a moment to process the significance of what's just happened; the sort that kick you in the head with their stupidity; the sort that just don't make any damn sense.<br/><br/>To be fair, it's not all bad news. There are some thrilling sequences, but the clunky transitions that attempt to further the narrative are grating (and the same sorts of associations readers were able to make with Honest Abe in the novel just aren't there on the big screen).<br/><br/>As a rule, I try to avoid comparing a movie with its literary counterpart as it's my conviction that the film should be examined of its own merit. Here, though, I found this an almost impossible task, as I kept mulling over the squandered potential. In essence, what director Timur Bekmambetov and his colleagues have turned in is a Cliffsnotes version of a unique story. I get the feeling they wanted something suited for popcorn-munchiness, and there's not necessarily anything wrong with that. But they should have considered the nuances of the source material; the narrative butter that would have made the whole thing much tastier and easier to swallow. In leaving that out, audiences are dealt a stale serving that's half burned. You know, the sort of thing that gets stuck between your teeth and it's an infuriating nuisance until you're able to pry it out with a toothpick in hopes of achieving sweet relief."
"p-stepien","5","1","2","23 December 2012"," The other Lincoln
","Based on the same-titled quasi-biographical horror novel by Seth Grahame-Smith retells the story of Abraham Lincoln (Benjamin Walker), portraying him as much more than a statesman responsible for toppling slavery, instead delving into his hidden identity as a vampire slayer. During his youth he witnessed his mother taken away by vampire Joshua Speed (Jimmi Simpson), thus the festering anger evolves into an unrelenting desire for revenge. Reckless in his craze Lincoln is confronted by reluctant vampire Henry Sturges (Dominic Cooper), who promises to teach him how to channel the hatred and become the ultimate scourge of vampires. Despite great success Lincoln ultimately stabilises his life in the arms of Mary Todd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and thus forfeits one craft focusing on his political career. However the path he started cannot be left so easily and simply...<br/><br/>Unlike the Steven Spielberg directed biography this Abraham Lincoln portrayal won't be getting any love at the Oscars or Golden Globes. Directed by Timur Bekmambetov of ""Night Watch"" fame offers more of the same in terms of style: bombastic expressive flair with an utter disrespect for substantial script backdrop. Despite an absolutely ridiculous concept, apt for much ridicule, the story premise isn't as cringe-worthy as expected. Various tidbits of Lincoln history fit in nicely to the concept of his career as a vampire hunter, whilst the involvement of vampires into the civil war is pretty sensible, if contemptuously disregarding for historical recounts.<br/><br/>All in all groups of audiences will cringe at the audacity of the idea, whilst others are certain to find an appeal. More inclined to the later, I was however put off by the somewhat turgid style of Bekmambetov, who does manage to put together luscious action sequences, but fails to instill enough heart into proceedings to make it anything more than eye candy. At times a peculiarly fun, if bloody, pastiche, else a somewhat nonsensical venture into triviality. Unfortunately not playful enough or conversely dark and dreary, instead has a cartoonish feel collaged with dramatic sequences from Lincoln's life. That said it seems necessary to underline that somehow the absurdity of Lincoln being a vampire slayer is scrumptiously fleshed into his biography, making it somewhat passable and not a sheer ridiculous running joke. Some of the CGI is somewhat plastic and strikingly obvious, especially regarding a sheer terrible vampire chase on top of stampeding horses. Not entirely a failure, but still not entertaining and engaging enough to be anything more than a pass-time: a fun idea devoid of enough fun to make it fulfill its promise."
"FairlyAnonymous","6","1","2","22 December 2012"," Better than expected but is only as good as its promise
","Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is a movie which delivers exactly what it promises. It promises a movie that takes itself seriously on a humorous topic and has good action scenes. And for an action flick it does deliver. The action is good, though sometimes repetitive, but it is still overly violent, bloody, explosion filled action. Of course the movie's plot isn't super complex or anything and doesn't try to be deep. It is a fun movie and is meant to be simply enjoyed and not really thought about.<br/><br/>The whole movie is basically a joke that takes itself seriously. Apparently vampires live in the south and are confederates so that they can use slaves as a food source. This explains as to why Abraham became a politician because his mission is to stop slavery and ultimately kill off the vampires. It is kind of hard to review this movie in depth because... well... there isn't much to talk about. The movie is entertaining, it has good action, its action sequences start to get repetitive, and it doesn't really stand out from the movie crowd other than its title. The acting was solid and the score was decent. There are some arguably offensive aspects of the movie such as saying that the Confederates were a bunch of murdering vampires and watching them get brutally killed seemed slightly... inappropriate.<br/><br/>All in all Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is an entertaining movie and doesn't really do anything wrong but doesn't really anything special. It's just another movie that will soon be forgotten."

The movie rapidly covers Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the United States' life from his childhood till almost demise. During that he discovers vampires are planning to take over the United States. He makes it his mission to eliminate them. Tim Burton's name behind this movie did create some expectations but when the promos went online everyone knew its pretty generic movie with no stamp of Tim Burton. In the whole movie there were two big scenes where CGI was required heavily and sadly it wasn't that impressive at all.

"nickgrossman83","5","1","2","14 October 2012"," Needed to be more humorous or less cheesy
","This film is an amalgam of inconsistencies; While I can't say I thoroughly enjoyed the film I also can't say I passionately hated it, and that in essence is why it frustrated me.<br/><br/>Firstly I need to talk about pace; this is an area where this film struggled throughout. I found myself feeling at times that the pace was too quick, character development felt far too rushed to the point where it seemed forced and unbelievable and at other times the pace was at such a crawl that I found myself bored (especially the latter half).<br/><br/>Visually this film was very beautiful. The sets and costumes especially were lovely; the visual effects through action sequences were also quite good to stunning, yet often far too 'over-the-top' in contrast with non- action sequences. That alone is indicative of this films fundamental flaw<br/><br/>The premise is, let's face it; is silly. Hearing the film title I was, at the time, expecting a tongue-in-cheek action/comedy romp, well it wasn't or at least it tried not to be. Watching the dialogue and character interactions it becomes quite apparent that the film does in fact take itself very serious, then in the blink of an eye the action sequences will ask you to suspend all your disbelief, and in a big way. The action sequences, while visually impressive basically feel like they belong in a different film, they're in-congruent with the viewer's primary experience of the film. The over-the-top nature of what happens in these scenes often made me howl with laughter or cringe at how ridiculous it was. This in itself wouldn't be a bad thing if that sense of absurdity flowed-through into the rest of the film; dialogue/story etc. But alas, it did not. It seemed like the director and the visual effects lead had two separate visions for the film and no one managed the harmony between the two. I appreciate this is a Hollywood film, so plenty of action sequences are required to appeal to the unthinking majority, yet why do they have to be so ridiculous? It cheapens the film as a whole and insults the watcher. The same level of eye candy could be maintained with more realistic actions, that way more of the viewers could be happy.<br/><br/>The plot seemed a bit lacking, especially from the middle of the film onwards. Some of the themes which could have been better utilised were glossed-over which removed immersion from the story. The antagonists felt like they were just thrown in because the story needed some bad guys. The characters weren't engaging; I didn't feel myself rooting for them or hoping they survived, I really didn't care about them and I think that was because they weren't built up properly from the beginning. In the latter portion of the film none of the characters had aged convincingly other than Abe, again killing the immersion. Overall I found the acting to be fine but the musical score however seemed out of place at times. <br/><br/>If this film was a comedy (not just in action sequences) it would have worked much better and been a lot more enjoyable for me. Alternatively if this film was consistently serious (especially during the action sequences) it may have also worked better for me. But this film is a tight-rope walker; it stumbles along the wire, losing balance over-and- over again. Many-a-time it fell and landed on its crotch, the wire relentlessly crushing fragile parts of its anatomy. While humorous to see at first it soon become embarrassing and painful to watch it get back up again and again."

","I didn't read the book and I didn't even know there was a book. That being said, I went in with no expectation of liking it. Going by nothing but the title, it sounds dumb and not interesting at all. I really liked this movie. Such an odd combination of Lincoln history & vampires. Who thinks this stuff up? It presents as a serious Lincoln biography, except there are vampires intertwined in the history..! For me , it's what I call mindless summer fun. However, it wasn't mindless and I never found myself bored or not caring or looking at my watch. It's action filled, I connected with the characters, I loved the detail in the costumes and sets. Oh, and ya, there are scary vampires and gory vampire killings. Think of the zombie killings in the TV show The Walking Dead because this is what I was reminded of. More like zombie killings than vampire slaying, but what's the difference anyway and does it matter? No. If you've never seen vampire/zombie gore, you may not like this aspect of the movie. And during the last scene where Henry is asking Abe to consider immortality and the conversation between he and Mary, I had a solitary tear weld up in my eye. For me, that is the sign of a good movie. Don't over-analyze it. Just go and see it for the fun of it. My demographic: 51, married woman. PS>>>> I'm editing this review to address all the reviews that say there is no story line in this movie. Get out your American History books, kids! The ""story line"" was pre written, even before the novel was. No, really, it was! The vampires are just an added bonus. Sheesh!"
"jaxbubba","6","1","2","30 June 2012"," A very warped, and deranged re-telling of our U.S. History
","An interesting conception; however, not without it's faults. This movie is part History Channel, part Vampire flick, part ""Matrix"" meets ""Couching Tiger, Hidden Dragon; and definitely worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>The story tells the tale of how a young Abraham Lincoln, lost his mother to a vengeful act of retribution from a vampire slave owner. Bound and determined to settle of score of his mother's death, Abraham inadvertently uncovers the secret world of vampires living amongst the human populace of 1861. Henry seeks solace and training from a fellow vampire hunter, Henry Sturgesss, played wonderfully by Dominic Cooper.<br/><br/>It seems that with every reincarnation of a new vampire film, Hollywood can take liberties with what a vampire can and cannot do; and this film is no different. In this film, Vampire can exist in daylight; have the ability to disappear from sight, and can only be killed with silver (and not a wooden stake to the heart). However, once converted into a vampire, you cannot take the life of another vampire; only the living can kill a vampire.<br/><br/>I have to admit that I did enjoy the fact that the film was set in 1861-66; the cinematography was an enhancement to the film's noir and mystique. Benjamin Walker made a wonderful ax-wielding 16th president; and once the beard was added, he was the spitting image of Honest Abe.<br/><br/>The film opens and closes with the following passage: ""History prefers legends, to men. It prefers nobility, to brutality. Soaring speeches, to quiet deeds. History remembers the battle, but forgets the blood. However history remembers me - - before I was a president - it shall only remember a fraction of the truth."" This is to ensure to the audience, that the fact that you are about to witness are true and factual; however, ""We, the people of the United States"", have elected to only concentrate on Abe Lincoln's Presidential feats, and not the fact that the Confederacy had teamed up with the Vampire factions in order to save their food supply.<br/><br/>A very warped, and deranged re-telling of our U.S. History; however, a quite original reinterpretation as well. Definitely not for everyone; however, if watched with an opened mind, it will be much more enjoyable. A half-hearted recommendation. So enjoy this film with slight reservations, and remember to always have a contingency plan!!!!! SEE MORE OF MY REVIEWS ON FB @ ""THE FARIS REEL"""

","Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter - It has been circulated for his greatness and determination. The father of all men in United State resembled too much of greatness to be rewritten in such plot and story. The myth and history combined into a fantasy epic film wasn't impress me much. For a huge character in a very tremendous journey of Abe, Benjamin Walker made it quite well. Alongside with his fellow friends, Henry Stugess (played by Dominic Cooper), Will Johnson (Anthony Mackie) and Joshua Speed (Jimmi Simpson), the struggle and adventure for a better nation free of vampires themed to the best brilliant attraction within this movie. Every aspect of action slot-visually or in storyline came out quite well though the CGI technique seemed too fragile and unreal in some parts of it. Speak to the moral values, every good wills or speeches, and the acts for greater kindness or versus the evil, the fact of Vampire Adam (Rufus Sewell) reminded me of some perspective where people keep turning our faith over something like this. But if you are some audiences looking for just entertainment and weekend out, this one certainly a good movie. Don't mind your logic too much. It may ruin your mood. And this isn't a history class but just fantasy after all. I shall give a solid four stars."

"TheSquiss","Null","1","2","30 June 2012"," Disengage brain, sit back and go with the flow.
","Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter. As titles go, it's up there with Snakes on a Plane and Cowboys Vs Aliens. In terms of quality and sheer entertainment value, it's somewhere between the second half of Cowboys Vs Aliens (about the time the aliens arrive) and the middle third of Snakes on a Plane. It's a 'disengage brain, sit back and go with the flow' kind of film. Don't expect much and you'll be pleasantly surprised. It's not terribly inventive, it's deeply flawed but, beyond all else, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is a lot of fun.<br/><br/>The films starts in 1818 with the young Abraham Lincoln living in Indiana with his parents (Robin McLeavy and, favourite of The Squiss, Joseph Mawle). We're given a quick background lesson as the young Lincoln a) befriends a young African American, William Johnson b) defends Johnson from a beating by the villainous Jack Barts c) watches his mother die after having her wrist 'kissed' by Barts and d) nurtures his desire for revenge for nine years before shooting Barts in the eye only to discover Barts doesn't die that easily because he's a vampire!<br/><br/>Lincoln, by now played by Benjamin Walker (as the film progresses he looks more and more like Liam Neeson who, coincidently, was slated to play Lincoln in Spielberg's biopic until he was replaced by Daniel Day-Lewis), is rescued from an extremely narked Barts by the mysterious Henry Strugess (Dominic Cooper on fine form). And so begins an odd partnership that leads to vampire hunting, bloodletting, violence and the love of a good woman.<br/><br/>After an enjoyable scene-setting first act, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter dives into the action with great gusto and for forty-five minutes or so completely forgets about the niceties of plot or continuity. The lighting and overall feel of the film changes scene by scene; one moment it's moody and gloomy, the next moment sepia images suggest flashbacks but it transpires we've actually advanced in time. It's both clumsy and erratic and there's nothing else to do than sit back, watch the fights and hope it makes sense again soon.<br/><br/>A fast-flowing sequence with a horse stampede is blurred with poor digital effects but still enjoyable for the pace and sheer audacity of it, and that's pretty much the format of the film. And using a horse as a weapon is an act of absurdity bordering on genius. The arrival of Refus Sewell as Adam, the big and very bad vampire boss is a welcome boost to the proceedings. It's a very obvious piece of casting but if you need villain who barely resists twiddling his waxed moustache and muttering ""Curses"" then Sewell is your man.<br/><br/>Director Timur Bekmambetov doesn't hide from the obvious references and lessons learned from his most successful films to date: Night Watch, Day Watch and the fabulously extreme Wanted. The fight sequences, Lincoln using an axe rather than the standard vampire-slaying silver bullets, are no longer original but still a great deal of fun although everything pales beside the stunning choreography of The Raid, which didn't need to rely on digital effects, blue screens or wire work. As with buses, there's no sign of an historical horror mashup for eons and then suddenly we experience a glut of them. If you're interested, soon to be released are the unrelated Abraham Lincoln Vs Zombies (direct-to-DVD and with a budget of $150,000 as opposed to Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter's $69 million!), FDR: American Badass and Pride and Prejudice and Zombies. On the basis of Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter's box office so far, there'll be a great many more following.<br/><br/>And that may not be a bad thing.<br/><br/>For more reviews from The Squiss subscribe to my blog at www.thesquiss.co.uk"
"Tommy-5","Null","1","2","27 June 2012"," An American Legend Fights a Private War
","It is not surprising this film had an Anne Rice type feel to it as it was shot in Louisiana. What is surprising to me is how, as one friend described it, such a ludicrous storyline could capture my fancy as it has. I suppose my fondness for horror films with catchy names has something to do with it. However, this one is more professionally done than such films as Jesse James vs. Frankenstein's Daughter or Billy the Kid vs. Dracula. (I'm not forgetting Buffy the Vampire Slayer!). <br/><br/>If you have read the book, well written by author Seth Grahame-Greene, you are familiar with the story. I believe he did very well in taking a giant of American history, placing him in such a preposterous situation, and pulling it off with dignity and taste. <br/><br/>The storyline, in case you are not aware, is straightforward and simple. As a child, young Abe Lincoln, (very well portrayed by Benjamin Walker), witnesses his mother being attacked by a vampire. After her death, he vows revenge. As it happens, a few years later the mysterious Henry Sturgess, (Dominic Cooper), injects himself into the life of Abe, now a young man. Sturgess trains Abe on how to be a vampire slayer. They create for Abe a specially made ax with the blade lined with silver. Older viewers will be reminded of the old Wild, Wild West television program. You will love the martial arts style ax work of Abraham Lincoln as he fights vampires to the death!<br/><br/>We are deep into suspension of disbelief territory now, but that is the fun of films like this. Sturgess assigns Abe the vampires to be slain and Abe follows his directions to the letter. Eventually we are introduced to head vampire/plantation owner Adam, played by Rufus Sewell, who was my favorite character in the movie. His ""enforcer,' the beautiful Erin Wasson as Vadoma, adds spice to an already colorful story. <br/><br/>Time passes and Abraham Lincoln is introduced to politics by meeting Stephen A. Douglas, (Alan Tudyk in an uncredited role) and eventually becomes the President of the United States. Abe has long since given up active pursuit of vampires, but learns the hard way that vampires and their hidden agenda are behind the secession of the southern states and the true cause of the Civil War.<br/><br/>There will be no spoilers here. View the film to see how Honest Abe Lincoln ultimately saves the Union. <br/><br/>Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter runs 105 minutes, just about right for a film such as this. The special effects are nicely done and, for a film about vampires and blood, the gore is not excessive. Russian director Timur Bekmambetov, perhaps without intending to, injected a slight feel of a European view of the American Civil War into the story. <br/><br/>This film will not be for everybody. Some will be offended at the use of Abraham Lincoln's name and reputation being used in this way. But, as stated earlier, it is done with dignity and Abraham Lincoln is every much the noble hero in the movie as we view him in real life. Something just as offensive, if not more so, is the use of the Confederacy as a mask for vampire domination. President Jefferson Davis is seen making a devil's deal with the despicable Adam and, for those of us with southern ancestry, this is disturbing. But, we need to remember this is a work of fiction, certainly not believable fiction in any way and I am certain there was no intention on the part of the writer to be disrespectful to anything or anybody.<br/><br/>I would recommend this film if you like modern day horror film making. It is not a great film. It is a good film and highly entertaining, which is all a film such as this needs to be."
"classicsoncall","7","1","2","23 June 2012"," ""I thought you were an honest man.""
","Every once in a while there comes a movie title that just screams out for recognition. The last one that grabbed me like this was ""Snakes on a Plane"", how do you NOT go to see what that's all about? So I have to admit, ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" is just too bizarre a concept to pass up. The film actually does a pretty good job of keeping things in historical perspective, and I was surprised how a detail like the Emancipation Proclamation was woven into the story line. Also, considering the title once again, the film makers outdid themselves with the Civil War battle scenes produced on a grander scale than I would have expected for what nominally aspires to be a horror film. I don't know if I would have been as interested in seeing this picture if Spielberg's Lincoln movie were not scheduled for release this coming December, but after seeing the trailer for Vampire Hunter a couple of weeks ago, it wasn't a difficult decision to catch this one on opening day.<br/><br/>What I probably should have seen coming was the way the vampire concept was linked to the evils of slavery during the nation's history during this era. After an initial encounter with vampires masquerading as local town folk during his young adulthood, Lincoln (Benjamin Walker) is tutored in the fine art of vampire hunting by a mentor named Henry Sturgess (Dominic Cooper). Lincoln sets aside those skills for a time when he takes up the political life, but is drawn back into it when as President, it becomes apparent that the Southern Army is heavily manned with legions of vampires. Borrowing another page from vampire lore, the Northern army fashions artillery made from silver in order to defeat the vampire hordes. Curious thing about those vampires though, I got the impression they behaved more like zombies, but I'm no expert here.<br/><br/>So this isn't going to be on everyone's must see list, but if you have even the slightest interest in the life of the sixteenth president and the Civil War, this is a treatment that you can have some fun with. You'll need an open mind of course, and probably a quick reaction time, because I don't think this will stick around in theaters too long. It will probably be out on DVD by the time the 'real' Lincoln movie comes out, with screenings on cable channels soon to follow. Just don't look for it on the History Channel."
"dtucker86","Null","1","2","22 June 2012"," So thats why Abe was so good with an ax!
","I have always loved history and Abraham Lincoln was always one of my heroes. Gee I didn't realize that he was this bad ass dude that went around whacking vampires! Shows you how little I know. Seriously, I like movies that try to cover new ground and be original and creative and the people that made this one really take the cake in that department, make that the whole bakery. I enjoyed the fact that they skillfully mix an original story with the known facts of Lincoln's life. For example, Lincoln did live in a place called Pigeon Creek when he was a boy; his mother did die when he was very young; he did work as a shopkeeper and have a friend named Joshua Speed and he had a young son named Willie that died in the White House. Like so many other horror movies, my complaint with this one is that it has so much gratuitous blood, guts and gore. What more then makes up for that, however, is a young actor named Benjamin Walker. He does an A+ job of bringing the 16th President to live. He convincingly shows Lincoln's humanity, courage and compassion and does as fine a job as any other actor who has played Lincoln in a serious movie. Critics usually don't give a lot of credence to horror films and the actors in them and thats a shame because in any other type of movie, Walker would be getting major headlines. Mary Elizabeth Winstead gives him able support as his wife Mary. She is portrayed as very loving, devoted and strong and that is wonderful because Mary Lincoln usually takes a character beating as a neurotic witch. The Civil War battle scenes in the movie are as realistic as any war between the states movie only its the vampires against the blue coats and the silverware wins (watch it and see). SPOILER I love how they end the movie with a little bit of irony. After Lincoln defeats the vampires, he and Mary decide to relax and celebrate, by going to the theater."
"bkoganbing","6","1","2","22 June 2012"," The Civil War was never taught like this
","If Bruce Catton or Shelby Foote were still alive those distinguished historians would never recognize the Civil War, especially for the root causes shown here. Black slaves aren't an institution in the South for agriculture, to pick cotton and tobacco. They are in bondage for a far more sinister purpose, as food for vampires who have taken control in the south.<br/><br/>Their untiring foe is Abraham Lincoln who fights them not on the political battle front, but by night due to his training as a railsplitter, he's pretty handy with an axe. He's hated the vampires ever since childhood when one of them killed his mother Nancy Hanks Lincoln. And here you thought she died of some frontier fever malady.<br/><br/>Benjamin Walker plays Lincoln and Dominic Cooper plays the mysterious Henry Sturgess who becomes his mentor. Lincoln should only have had the kind of moves Bruce Lee would have envied in his life. Who would have thought it, Abraham Lincoln: Action Hero.<br/><br/>You have to see how the fate of the nation at the Battle of Gettysburg is decided. Not to be believed.<br/><br/>Everyone looked like they were having a grand old time making this film. And of course it's all claptrap, but enjoyable claptrap at that."

"changmoh","6","6","35","20 June 2012"," Absurd Revisionist Fantasy
","From the title, it is obvious that this is NOT the Abe Lincoln that we  know from the history books. The curiosity factors aroused by this  film, directed by Timur Bekmambetov of ""Wanted"" {2008} and ""Daywatch""  {2006} fame, are how creatively the film-makers 'bastardise' American  history, and the set action pieces that Bekmambetov and his crew have  set up.  The answer: They are impressive but a bit ludicrous.  Adapted from the book by Seth Grahame-Smith (who also wrote the  screenplay), the film chronicles the loss of Abe's mother (Robin  MacLeavy) at the hands of a vampire when Abe is still a child. This  serves as the motivating factor for Abe's (Benjamin Walker) subsequent  vampire hunting mission and his burgeoning career as a lawyer and  politician to, finally, his Presidency during the Civil War. Along the  way, he kills countless bloodsuckers led by the vile and vicious Adam  (Rufus Sewell) as part of his secret war against the undead.  The movie is obviously a mix of biopic and horror flick but it fails at  both, and ends up being an expensive action film. This is evident in  the story which has Abe wielding an ax against the marauding vampires  instead of guns with silver bullets. With the ax, we get blood splashes  and dramatic combat action - the sort of targets Bekmambetov usually  aims for. Still, two of his set pieces stand out: a rodeo-styled chase  during a horse stampede, and a climactic fight on a runaway train  speeding across a burning bridge.  I am not really a fan of the main vampire plot which borders on the  ridiculous but Grahame-Smith provides a few interesting and absorbing  subplots, namely the relationship between Abe and his wife Mary Todd  (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). There is chemistry between Walker and  Winstead that makes us care about and believe in this absurd version of  the First Couple. Also, Walker, who looks like a young Liam Neeson (he  has played the younger version of Neeson's title character in Kinsey),  exudes the simple and honest charm one normally associates with Abe  Lincoln. Hence, bravo to the casting department.  One the minus side, the anti-slavery subplot and his rise to the  Presidency are given the short shrift; and the man-vs-vampire clashes  are so absurd that we are constantly reminded that this is revisionist  pulp fiction trying to get on the bandwagon of ""Twilight""'s popularity."

"guitarman779","5","1","3","13 January 2014"," Good Historical Timeline, Decent Action, Confusing Plot, and Bad CGI
","""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" is one of the most confusing movie's I've seen in a long time. It's main problem is that it tries to be too many things at once. In the beginning it's a horror-suspense flick with two good jump scares and dark creepy atmosphere. However once Lincoln meets Henry it becomes an action-thriller with some cool stunts but ultimately drowns in its' own fake blood and repetitiveness. From here on is where it becomes trippy and confusing. Lincoln has a strange change of heart and decides slavery is more important than stopping the Vampires and the movie turns into a pseudo-documentary about Lincoln's presidency. This political melodrama continues until Lincoln's son gets killed, prompting Henry's return where they decide to be badass vampire hunters again. What?<br/><br/>Despite this horribly confusing plot the acting isn't that bad. The best acting in my opinion was that of Dominic Cooper who played Henry Struges. Cooper makes the character consistent and entertaining throughout the movie and manages to make the viewer care about Sturges. Benjamin Walker who played Lincoln does a good job though he does come off a bit dry and under-enthusiastic in some scenes. Where I believe Walker does best is capturing Lincoln's grief of losing his son where he knows it's his fault and he could have stopped it.<br/><br/>Another facet where the movie dropped the ball is special effects. The movie relied so much on CGI that at times scenes couldn't be taken seriously for how fake they were. The worst offender in my opinion is horse stampede. The scene is supposed Lincoln finally getting revenge on Jack Barts, the vampire who killed his mother, but ends up being a ridiculous acrobatic equestrian fight that is almost entirely CGI.<br/><br/>Overall this isn't a completely awful movie but it does leave a lot to be desired. It would have been better had it stayed with its' original horror-suspense-action formula instead of deviating into historical melodrama. The historical aspects could have been mentioned as the story progressed but instead they made the entire middle third about Lincoln becoming president and ending slavery. The oddest thing about this part of the movie is that it's clear they spent a lot of time trying to make it historically accurate instead of entertaining. The film ends up being saved by its' acting which give it some funny moments and somewhat likable characters."

This is a thoroughly enjoyable movie, with fantastic performances from the entire cast, but especially so from Abraham himself, a (to me) completely unknown actor and thoroughly deserving leading man.

"terrellrobinson71","8","1","3","12 July 2013"," Move over, Twilight! Abraham Lincoln is making vampires look cool again
","Who knew that our 16th President of the United States had a secret life that nobody (including your friendly humble reviewer here) knows about? And who knew that a movie called ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" would actually be a wickedly cool action/horror movie that has a surprisingly quirky sense of humor as well as a warm heart? Whether if you knew so much about Honest Abe or if you've been dozing off during History Class, this movie might put you in your place if you're looking for something special to watch whether it's on Halloween or the night before your history exam. Directed with visual gusto by Timur Bekmambetov, the Russian genius that brought us 2008's ""Wanted"" and produced by one of my favorite filmmakers, Tim Burton, ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" follows our title character, played marvelously with star appeal and charm by Benjamin Walker, before he became the president that created the Emancipation Proclamation. He's a young lad seeking revenge on the vampire that killed his mother when he was a kid. Only then, he will need some guidance from a stranger named Henry Sturges (Dominic Cooper) who teaches Abe how to destroy vampires. (Don't forget, Henry is one, too.) His mission is to destroy every vampire he sees including his mother's killer, Jack Barts (Marton Csokas), its leader, Adam (Rufus Sewell) and his sexy enforcer of a sister named Vadoma (Erin Wasson). They have a part to play by creating a nation full of vampires. Whenever he's not around slaying vampires with his silver ax, Abe develops a sweet relationship with Mary Todd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), who will become his future First Lady, but even if he has to keep his profession secret from her, especially becoming the president we already know the history of, it's only a matter of time for him to save our nation before it would be at its end. As one of two movies of 2012 that tells the history of Honest Abe, ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" is one of those vampire movies that, unlike ""The Twilight Saga"", makes vampires cool again. It's not meant to be taken seriously, even though it's half a true story, it keeps a straight face by not trying to make it go over-the-top. The action sequences are spectacular and wildly original (two of my favorite ones are the chase with stampeding CGI horses and the climatic one with the train on the burning train tracks), the look of the film is fantastic, bringing a lot of grit and beauty to a action movie that has bite and the cast is just perfect, which also includes Anthony Mackie as Abe's childhood friend, Will, Jimmi Simpson as shopkeeper-turned-friend Joshua Speed and even an unbilled Alan Tudyk stops by for a few scenes as Stephen A. Douglas. Even the villains doesn't get to sneer or go over-the-top, except for one. Not to mention, the screenplay by Seth Grahame-Smith, who adapted the movie based on his fantastic best-selling novel, has a lot of wit and some funny one-liners. For example, when Henry asks what kind of weapons Abe like to use for killing vampires, he says that he's not very good with shooting irons, but he adds this: ""But I was a rail splitter."" It's a thrilling, funny, sometimes gory, and intense bloody adventure that's well worth looking at more than once. Plus, does this movie that has a vampire throwing a horse at our hero say ""no"" to you?"

Director has no control over storylie.actors are completely clueless. Not a good idea to make such a childish crap on a historical icon like Lincoln. Hollywood is known for creativity. But these days they are making craps like Abraham Lincoln, mysterious Iceland, twilight.........etc. Its not wonder that we could see another sequel of this film. I am not against sequels but please this is a boring plot. Its better to watch old flicks like dollar series. Huge disappointment from this so called film."

","Wow...IMDb sure likes to protect their own beliefs and censor any dissenters. I've had two deleted reviews--one for this movie challenging the antagonistic portrayal of Southerners as 'racists' and one for 'Taking Woodstock' challenging the homosexual content. Nevermind that I read other reviews commending Abe Vamp for its accuracy (example below) or Woodstock for its 'courage.' With such controversial topics, shouldn't all opinions be valued in a free society? Oh, it must be 'hate speech' if it goes against your personal agenda.<br/><br/>Comment from another reviewer about Abe Vamp: ""The Southern Confederacy, desiring to hold on to the last vestiges of gentility lest they get their white hands dirty, declared itself free from the Union in order to retain the right to own people as if they were property."" Reviewer goes on to insinuate that this is realistic. Southerners have always known better...ever since the war ended. Power vs. peasants...just the way it has always been.<br/><br/>Please, ban me from this garbage dump."

The movie feels like a long, boring history lesson, despite the fact that it holds little historic credence. The whole thing is bland, hollow, weakly acted (Except for Marton Csokas, but that's only because he's a walking, talking hambone), and the action screws with the tone. There is one good action sequence, A train sequence near the end. That scene is how the rest of the movie should have been like.

"geopridham","4","1","4","23 October 2012"," This movie takes itself too seriously.
","What I was hoping for when I sat down and watched this was some action and some comedy. I was hoping for a movie that didn't take itself too seriously. Needless to say, this wasn't what I got. I really don't know what to say about the ""vampire"" genre anymore except that I really can't stand it. This movie is trite, overdone and completely laughable (not in a good way).<br/><br/>Another issue with this movie is the time sequences. The movie moves too quickly with not enough character development to actually allow the viewer to get to know the characters a bit better. Lincoln is a prime example of this as he goes from tragedy to champion vampire murderer in a matter of seconds it seems. More development could have been done with Henry Sturgess' character as well. He seems to completely fade in and out of relevancy.<br/><br/>With that out of the way, there are some good technical aspects of the film. The camera work is solid and some of the effects are neat. Rufus Sewell is good too as the villain (a role he seems to excel in). The venues in which the movie was shot made the viewer feel like they were immersed in the past.<br/><br/>Imagine the movie ""Zombieland"" taking itself seriously. You would then have this movie as the result."
"kdnor2011","3","1","4","16 October 2012"," Not as infuriating as Wanted, but still pretty bad.
","I had low, and I mean LOW expectations for this movie. Not because of any reviews, but because this movie is directed by Timur Bekmambetov, who's last movie ""Wanted,"" infuriated me to my core and is currently my least favorite movie of all time. Now the idea for this movie, seemed like it could be a fun, action, guilty pleasure type of flick along with something like Transformers, but man this movie was annoying. Like I said, I went in with, well, absolutely no positive expectations, and it's a good thing too. Well this movie was bad, it didn't tick me off like ""Wanted"" did. Oh this is currently the worst movie I've seen so far this year, but it was mostly because the film was annoying and boring.<br/><br/>Here's the thing, I can't stand Timur Bekmambetov's style of direction, it annoys the crap out of me. Basically, he films all his action scenes the same way. He starts off in some slow motion, and then speeds it up for a quick second and then goes normal after the cool part has happened. This can be used very well if it is done right, but Bekmambetov just does it so frequently that it becomes annoying. He also adds so much CGI, and it all looks incredibly fake. Just like the bullets in Wanted, everything in here, including the Vampires were very cheap looking. And most of the time, I couldn't even tell what was going on in the fight scenes. The characters are forgettable, there is one character I liked, and I'll get to him later. Benjamin Walker and Mary Elizabeth Winstead have no chemistry and just come off as bland. It's very inconsistent, the (Spoilers) Vampires have the power to turn invisible. How? Never explained. But if they can turn invisible, and they know that Lincoln is president, so why don't they just turn invisible, sneak into the white house and bite him. Also, I thought Vampires couldn't have they're pictures taken, yet they have dozens of pictures of one taking off his glasses. I'm no history nut, so I don't know how well this fits into history. But I did do a little research and found out that Lincoln had four sons, and only one was in the film. Granted one died like 10 years before the civil war, but wouldn't it be nice to acknowledge the rest of them besides William. And finally it's just a bore. It's not the most boring film I've seen all year, but basically, why am I watching this? To see Abraham Lincoln kill Vampires, and do I get that? Well through half the movie we follow young Lincoln, who I couldn't care less about. Then we get to the Lincoln we all recognize with the beard and hat, but for most of the second half he doesn't do anything interesting, he just sort of stands around and tries to figure out how to win the war. This might be good in a documentary of Lincoln, or a biography, but in a movie called Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, I want to see Lincoln killing Vampires. And the movie takes itself way too seriously. Yes, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is played straight. What part of that title makes it sound like it was meant to be played straight? The only time Lincoln, the one we recognize, fights is in the last half hour, and even then, his friend does most of the work.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, William Johnson is the one character in this movie I cared about. He's played by Anthonly Mackie, who ironically played the only character I cared about in the Hurt Locker as well. He actually has some pretty cool moments, and I actually felt sorry for him a few times. In terms of production value it is a pretty good looking film. The costumes, make up and sets all do look pretty nice. And I will give Bekmambetov this, he can really shoot one hell of a train crash. The train crash in this, and in Wanted were both the best parts of the movie. And to this movie's credit they saved that part for the end and not in the middle.<br/><br/>Overall this movie wasn't as quite as infuriating as I thought it would be. But that doesn't mean it's good. Like with Wanted, I would forgive this movie if it were entertaining, but it really isn't, it's a bore. As bad as Wanted was, it at least gave you what it promised, it was bad, but it did give you plenty of action. I don't hate Timur Bekmambetov as a person, I don't know him personally. But his style annoys the hell out of me. But to be fair he isn't the only one at fault here, the moronic writers who played this movie straight deserve an equal part of the blame.<br/><br/>2.5/10"

","This film was not too bad. It had a big budget and you can tell that by the special effects. It reminded me of films like PRIEST, UNDERWORLD and RESIDENT EVIL because of those effects with the slow motion action shots, which I like a lot. The story was actually not that bad as I'd heard some reviews saying this was a bad movie. But I found it to be entertaining and enjoyable to watch only because of the action scenes (one involving a stampede of horses - well done I thought) and I liked how it gives you another version of the history of Abraham Lincoln even though you know it is not true, but for me that didn't take anything away from this movie. Yeah, it's not great and it's over the top, but it definitely is not horrible. An enjoyable movie to watch if you have young teens who want to see a fun movie on a weekend with the parents.

","Okayso let's get this all straightfamed president Abraham Lincoln's mother was murdered by a vampire, which led Abe to become a trained vampire hunter and seek revenge on his mother's killer. Ohand vampires controlled the slave trade in the Confederate South. WellIf you're okay with the new rewrite on history, you can probably get into this movie and enjoy the ride.<br/><br/>Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is delectably dark. The film's special effects team did a great job making vampires that are actually terrifying. The fight scenes are action packed and gory. Think Underworld meets The Walking Dead. And if you're a fan of the kinds of intensely gruesome deaths found in those kinds of projects, then do yourself a favor and watch the film in 3D. You will get to experience first hand how the vampire blood splatters from honest Abe's silver ax and fly out towards to the audience. Finally a 3D effect I can get on board with.<br/><br/>The film is set to a furious pace that refuses to allow the audience to dwell on the insanely dumb plot, and doesn't give way to any scenes that may slow down the vampire killing action, like Abe and Mary Todd falling in love (I mean who really wants to see that when there are so many blood suckers that need to be destroyed).<br/><br/>Director Timur Bekmambetov who also directed 2008's Wanted, proves he can handle a big budget film & writer Seth Grahame-Smith apparently saved all his entertaining vampire writing for this one, and not his dud script for Dark Shadows.<br/><br/>The film's premise is obviously completely ridiculous. What comes nextGrover Cleveland: Mummy Stalker or Ronald Reagan: Werewolf Tamer. But in the end the film comes out as unique and exciting. And it's kind of cool to see the most infamous president destroying evil with his bare hands while adding a new credit to his historical resume. I meanwho wouldn't want Vampire Hunter listed right above proficiency with Microsoft Office.<br/><br/>For more quick reviews check out www.FilmStallion.com"
"achyutaghosh","6","1","4","14 July 2012"," Abraham Lincoln: Swing and a miss
","""History prefers legends to men""<br/><br/>Why have vampires invaded pop culture? Is the lines between modern man and monster blurring? Is it a personality change preference for our generations- no longer for the cheerleader type, the darker the better- intelligent, moody, mysterious and reticent. Or is it just a heady concoction of fantasy-land entertainment and escapism? Whatever be the reason is not up for debate here, but a film with a name such as Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter needs a bit of perspective.<br/><br/>It takes a lot of gumption and imagination to portray one of history's most astute leaders as a Gothic horror hunter- AB:VH is based on Seth Graham Smith's 2010 mash-up fiction novel, and directed by Russian director Timur Bekmambetov. In this alternate version of American history got extra bloody- it starts with young AB devastated by the killing of his mother by a vampire, and somehow that gets linked to his hatred of slavery. AB, played by Benjamin Walker, dedicates the rest of his life hunting for his mother's killer and later on declares total war on the racist bloodsuckers (yes, racist- all the vampires in the movie are white and they feeding on the black slaves is termed an essential reason for slavery to continue), in the pursuit of which he is mentored by a repentant vampire- Henry Sturges in his journey from a fledgling assassin to a vampire hunting politician. <br/><br/>Vampire fiction is an open canvas these days, with their powers changing at the sway of any particular authors brush-strokes. In AB's world, all vampires need is sunscreen and sunglasses, and pronto- they can walk in the sun. No stake through the heart, or the revered cross and holy water combo- Henry says that ever since Judas was given 30 pieces of silver for his betrayal, silver became the curse of the cursed, so these vampires can be killed by all things silver, and joyfully, AB silver coats his chosen weapon to hunt the infernal species till about interval. Post that he has to concentrate on his family life, his political career and govern the country through its most troubled times. His skills with the axe are again called back upon when vampires start turning the tide in the Civil War against him. <br/><br/>Historical fallacies be damned but even the initial reversals at the historical battle of Gettysburg are attributed to the undead, and more ridiculous is the way AB marshals all the silver in the land into bayonets and canon shells, all within a span of a day (The actual Gettysburg battle lasted 2 days). But then this is not a thinking man's movie, for with a name as Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, ridiculousness should come marked in capital letters on the package. And unfortunately, it doesn't. Who wouldn't want to laugh at bearded AB with his swinging axes tearing apart the undead? This is a movie that should have been fun- gone all out over the top, put in some jokes, upped the entertainment and involvement, but it tries to play safe- fusing intense vampire flick with a campy premise. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong though- the film has plenty of bright spots- first of all, Benjamin Walker who looks like a younger Liam Neeson, is solid as AB, and Dominic Cooper as Henry has a great time too. Since our hero handles an axe rather well, gore lovers can expect a fair share of decapitations and other brutalities. The action scenes are fairly unorthodox- at one point, a vampire throws a horse at AB! The artwork and costumes is impressively detailed- the first shot in the movie is sheer genius- starts with contemporary skyline of Washington and then slowly changes to settings 150 years ago, with an under construction White House. I being a lover of historical themed movies didn't find the pace slow too. <br/><br/>On the flip side, Timur Bekmambetov overall treatment errs on the side of caution to make this a humorless affair. While his earlier takes on vampires (Nightwatch and Daywatch) were visionary and Wanted was in its own way excellent, this one is kind of a step down. 3D and horror are made for each other- AB:VH has a couple of scary moments, wish there were more. Mary Elizabeth Winstead as AB's supportive wife Mary Todd stepped on a bowler's hat to unattainable heights, might be a ""creature of ravishing resourcefulness"" but doesn't get too much to do. The special effects were largely inconsistent- some of the fights were excellent, but others were cartoonishly childish, including the climactic burning bridge sequence. Also a curious lack of star power, and a non charismatic and non scary villain in Rufus Sewell didn't help either.<br/><br/>To sum up, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is not for everyone- its neither a historical as it is factually inaccurate, and its neither a fully blown monster epic. It is essentially an alternate history romp into silliness played with admirable seriousness thus doing somewhat justice to its title- for some people it will work, for some it will not. <br/><br/>Not too scary and not too funny and lacking zing- 6/10 from a horror movie fan, then."

","As someone who read the book, I was utterly disappointed and confused as to why Seth Grahame-Smith would write a screenplay for his own book that was entirely different from the original story. Perhaps the Hollywood execs didn't like his book or Grahame-Smith decided to tell a new tale. Either way, the book was lost in translation. Many historical details from the book were thrown out the window, characters are added and/or altered in their roles, plot lines were lost, and the ending is different. The only real similarities are that Abraham Lincoln is the main character and that he hunts vampires. While the movie is not absolutely horrible, it's unfortunate that a good book was not brought to the screen. So, if you enjoyed the book and were looking for a good adaptation, don't look here."

His father stopped him but what he didn't know was that he was messing with vampires and they killed his mother and eventually his father died too. <br/><br/>Honest Abe vowed vengeance against the vampire who killed his mother, and some vampire hunter named Henry taught Abe Batman-style the ways of killing a vampire.

","I saw this DVD in the rental store Blockbuster, not long before it closed down, it sounded like a rather ridiculous idea for a film, but then I saw it did have positive reviews, so I thought ""what the hell"" and gave it a go, directed by Timur Bekmambetov (Wanted). Basically as a child Abraham Lincoln (Benjamin Walker) witnessed his mother being killed by a vampire, Jack Barts (Marton Csokas), ten years later Abe tried to eliminate Barts, without success. Abe makes acquaintance with Henry Sturges (Dominic Cooper), who teaches him how to fight and how to kill a vampire, and this leads Abe onto a crusade to kill all vampires that terrorise the town Henry directs him to. Abe then relocates to Springfield, Illinois where he gets a job as a store clerk, there he also studies law, while also killing vampires at night, he also meets and eventually marries beautiful Mary Todd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). Years later Abe's ultimate challenge comes though when he is elected President of the United States, meaning his days of killing vampires are over as he must concentrate on running the country, but then he comes to realise that vampires are fighting with the Confederate forces, so he mounts his own campaign to defeat them. Also starring Anthony Mackie as Will Johnson, Rufus Sewell as Adam, Alan Tudyk as Stephen A. Douglas, Jimmi Simpson as Joshua Speed, Jaqueline Fleming as Harriet Tubman, Robin McLeavy as Nancy Lincoln, John Rothman as Jefferson Davis, Joseph Mawle as Thomas Lincoln and Cameron M. Brown as Willie Lincoln. Walter gives a good performance and has a good likeness to the 16th President of the United States, and as the vampire hunter he cool as well, there is the obvious small slavery subplot and political stuff, but I was much more interested in the gory violence as ""Honest Abe"" kills the many nasty monsters along the way to become the influential man he was, the action sequences are fun to watch and I think its the fact that its a bit ridiculous that makes it appealing, a an outlandish but enjoyable horror thriller. Good!"

","I am now ready to pass judgment on the battle of the Lincoln films (2012). For those who may have forgotten, there were two: Steven Spielberg's Lincoln and Timur Bekmambetov's Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter. One of them was very good (the Bekmambetov); the other was awful (the Spielberg). Spielberg's Lincoln was ponderous and unilluminating, a leaden soporific. It was compelling and came to life only when James Spader or Sally Field was on screen. (I gave it a C-.) Daniel Day Lewis was, in a way, too faithful in incarnating Lincoln, so much so that he seemed to be robotic (the cinematic equivalent of the animatronic Lincoln in Disneyland). I think that the film would have put Lincoln himself to sleep. (Ken Burns did this much better in his PBS series on the Civil War.) Bekmambetov's Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, on the other hand, was a surprising gem of a film. However perverse the premise may be, it was done with such panache that it was credible. (I gave it a B.) In a strange way, this film was much truer to the spirit of Lincoln than the Spielberg was. In addition, it gave one a clearer (and concise) overview of Lincoln's entire life and a fuller (but still concise) picture of the war than one finds in Spielberg's film. Caleb Deshcanel's cinematography shows that he is still at the top of his game. Furthermore, it was a damn good story that kept me glued to the screen. I do not want to give a spoiler, so I will leave it to you to guess on which side in the war the vampires fought. (My only negative comment is that there was one gratuitous expletive in the middle of the film. However, these days, one is practically none. Except for that, I would have rated the film G since I do not think that children need to be shielded from stylized violence.) If you have to choose one of the two, my recommendation is to go with the vampires."

","Yes, as the title says, Abraham Lincoln is a 'vampire hunter.' It's obvious when you think about it. And the civil war was fought against vampires. Again, how did you NOT know? Okay, this film is silly. But then the title is unforgivably silly, so the film-makers assume that you know it's silly before you spend your money watching it. And they're right. It is silly. However, not THAT silly. For a start (believe it or not) the film follows Lincoln's life pretty closely (yes, apart from the inclusion of vampires... obviously), almost to the point that it's historically accurate! Then there are the action sequences. The undead hurl themselves in droves in Lincoln's direction, only to be sliced and diced in trendy slow motion effects with blood splattering everywhere - hardly traits of a comedy.<br/><br/>Despite the film's kind of cheeky title, there aren't that many laughs (or even tongue in cheek moments) along the way. That's possibly what made it feel a little odd for me. From the title I was expecting a much dafter movie. What I got was an oldie-worldy action film with some reasonably high production values and attempts at remaining true to the historical text (again, if you don't count the vampire inclusion).<br/><br/>If you like vampires and action, you'll probably like this. Think 'Blade set in times past' and you probably get the idea.

"higherall7","7","0","1","18 January 2014"," ""If you listen closely, you can hear Honest Abe laughing!""
","This is a tall tale like the kind I used to tell in Music Class in elementary school. The premise is so off the wall that the onus is on the storyteller to pull the sucker off. This is the kind of story Gordie LaChance, one of the main characters in the movie 'Stand By Me', would reel off to his buddies while they sat around the campfire. The general conversation would somehow drift over to the subject of which was scarier, zombies or vampires, after a learned discussion of girls, sex, and the teachers you hated the most.<br/><br/>At this point, the natural storyteller responds as though on cue.<br/><br/>""Bet you didn't know Abraham Lincoln was a Vampire Hunter!""<br/><br/>This sets off an explosion of laughter and howls of derision.<br/><br/>""What? Like that bitch Buffy?""<br/><br/>""No, he wasn't!""<br/><br/>""You're crazy, man!""<br/><br/>But, of course, this is where the fun begins.<br/><br/>I do not at this point want to give you the impression that this movie is somehow a Camp comedy like Mel Brooks' 'The Producers' or 'Young Frankenstein'. Because the truth is it is played straight and not for laughs.<br/><br/>That in itself is the wonder of it all.<br/><br/>I remember when virtually nobody thought that 'Beetlejuice' guy Michael Keaton could possibly play a caped crusader also known as the Batman. Later on, I shook my head at how wrong I was.<br/><br/>This now makes for the second time.<br/><br/>I was not going to see this movie. I did not seek this movie out. The premise seemed ridiculous and in bad taste. Why make a joke out of The Great Emancipator like this?<br/><br/>Of course it is some kind of pastiche, but I defy you not to be pleasantly surprised as I was by the time the end credits rolled around.<br/><br/>Everyone knows how hard it is to establish and maintain a suspension of disbelief for any story; particularly for improbable subject matter. But herein lies the beauty of 'Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter'. I think what happens here is that the Mythology of The Great Emancipator interfaces with the Mythology of The Prince of Darkness and instead of being degraded and debased by this Gothic romance, elevates and lends it dignity! Put another way, the Soul Force of Honest Abe proves to be more powerful than the Mojo of any Undead Bloodsucker.<br/><br/>Anyway, that is my theory and I am sticking to it!<br/><br/>This mixture of two elements or substances that seem at the outset grossly incompatible proves in actual practice to produce a compound of truth and fiction that is oddly palatable and satisfying. Something like mixing hot sauce with black-eyed peas or eating barbecued flavored potato chips with ice cream. It should not work; it should make you sick to your stomach, and yet for some odd reason as a midnight snack it just hits the spot.<br/><br/>This also resolves what Kirk Douglas and Burt Lancaster once admitted was a long standing argument between themselves as to the purpose and function of Art. The long standing debate between the two friends was should Art primarily teach or should it primarily entertain. Kirk believed that Art's primary function was to entertain and life lessons learned from it were simply icing on the cake. Burt believed the exact opposite. Now I find myself leaning towards and favoring Douglas' point of view. There are many things referenced here and touched upon in passing without being explored in depth and I'll leave it to you to discover what these subjects are. <br/><br/>I almost forgot that one of the joys of storytelling is to tell a whopper in such a convincing way that your audience goes along for the sheer thrill of the ride, even as they know full well that this never happened this way and yet if it were to happen like this, doggone, I believe it would be something like the way this is being told.<br/><br/>I also believe this explains the appeal of 'Django Unchained', although I believe it is rated too high just as this film is rated too low. I would rate both films a seven and submit that they easily reflect and clarify each other. Plus, you don't have to worry about finding any good white people in either of these films, as was the complaint about Spike Lee's flawed masterpiece 'Malcolm X'. The races unite with heroic 'elan, particularly in 'Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter', to fight against a universal evil that is sucking the life and soul out of the country. This, despite the wildly improbable context, strikes a meaningful chord of realism."
"trashgang","7","0","1","11 December 2013"," typical Timur flick
","This flick will divide the viewers in two camps just like the story itself, how cool is that. By which I mean, it's not a straight horror story. It's never frightening and the story itself can't be taken serious and it's that fact that will turn away the lovers of horror.<br/><br/>On the other hand it's easy to spot that it was directed by Timur Bekmambetov. Just watch the fight scene's how it all was filmed. Most done in slow motion and that's so typical for Timur. Remember Nightwatch (2004) and what followed. So for people who loves this kind of filming or do adored The Matrix (1999) its fight scene's then this surely will be your cup of tea.<br/><br/>That it was shot in 3D gave it an extra but it does hide the weak script. Don't get me wrong, it never was boring but if you think about Lincoln really being a vampire killer and the battle at Gettysburg being done between vampires from the south and humans from the north then this in fact a rip-off of his own Nightwatch franchise. But I must say that the effects looked stunning and that the 3D really worked. Just watch the horse ride and towards the end the disaster with the train. It's all exaggerated but let that also be the autograph of Timur. <br/><br/>The acting itself was believable except when getting older you could spot that the beards were as fake as it could be. Still i enjoyed it because I don't have any problem with Timur's films so far. But some are fed up with him giving always the same treat. <br/><br/>At the end of the day it's just a twist on American history filled with extra effects.<br/><br/>Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 5/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5"
"Hey_Sweden","7","0","1","18 October 2013"," I must admit, I haven't read the novel.
","By several accounts here, the movie is a travesty compared to Seth Grahame-Smiths' novel, which is odd considering that Grahame-Smith himself wrote the screenplay. The movie ultimately isn't about nuance but turns into a full-blown, over the top, cartoon-like action- horror movie. It's definitely fun to a degree, but one does have to ""turn their brain off"" before watching. At the least, it puts a highly amusing genre spin on events in American history.<br/><br/>It turns out that Americas' 16th president was more than the man who freed the slaves. He was also the man that fought the vampires that were scheming to overtake the country. In a hilarious contrivance by the author, the entire Confederate army is composed of savage bloodsuckers. But I'm getting ahead of myself. The movie introduces us to the young Lincoln, who witnessed his mother being attacked by a vampire. He wants vengeance, and ends up mentored by mysterious Henry Sturges (Dominic Cooper). Honest Abe (sincerely portrayed by Benjamin Walker) then sets out on a mission to destroy all creatures of the night.<br/><br/>Admittedly, this movie may lose some viewers by the nature of its action set pieces, the first being a horse stampede and the other an overdone finale on a train. The rampant CGI may take them out of what is an interesting curiosity otherwise. Director Timur Bekmambetov does manage to create some poignant moments amid all the lunacy, while still doing his damnedest to prevent the audience from getting bored. Production design and cinematography do give this a nice comic book sort of look. The cast gives admirably straight faced performances, with Rufus Sewell, Marton Csokas, and Erin Wasson as villains, Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Mary Todd, and Anthony Mackie and Jimmi Simpson as Abes' friends.<br/><br/>All in all, ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" is no great shakes; at times it's not really distinguishable from other action-horror mashups, but it still might intrigue some genre fans, and history buffs who won't be offended by the concept.<br/><br/>Seven out of 10."
"sddavis63","5","0","1","9 September 2013"," Interesting Blend Of History with Action-Horror
","I have to confess that, based on the title alone, this movie has intrigued me for a long time. I have to confess as well that, based on the title alone, I've put off watching this movie for some time. It seemed a little bit - well - too strange. It seemed a little bit too obvious of an attempt to capitalize on the expectations about the blockbuster film ""Lincoln"" that was due to come out just a few short months after this was released. So, with all the hype about that, let's try to put something else together that can capitalize on the interest and make a few bucks. And, to be honest, I wasn't expecting very much from this.<br/><br/>Now, truth be told, I was somewhat surprised. ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" turns out to be a reasonably enjoyable movie. It's certainly a unique way of blending horror-style actions with a sort-of quasi- history. It starts with a mysterious and even frightening atmosphere, although that fades into a more action-oriented horror story after a while. The significant events of Lincoln's life (from the death of his mother when he was a young boy to the death of his son Will when he was president) are woven into this account of a battle against vampires, who have seen slavery as an opportunity to satisfy their thirst for blood. Ultimately, the Civil War itself is seen as part of that supernatural battle, with vampires allying themselves with the Confederacy, and the Battle of Gettysburg being essentially against vampiric Confederate forces. I'm not saying at all that the history is accurate. It's just that the movie does manage to blend a historical narrative pretty well into a fantasy.<br/><br/>Benjamin Walker was actually not too bad as Lincoln. He was earnest, and obviously took the role very seriously. In fact, while I was glad that this didn't turn out to be a comedy that went for laughs, I did think that perhaps the greatest weakness was that at times it took itself a bit too seriously. Nevertheless it was quite watchable most of the way through. The ""train"" scenes, near the end of the movie, went on a little bit too long, I thought. Yes, they were decent action scenes, but too much for me to be honest. The movie didn't end as I thought it would (which was a good thing, by the way.)<br/><br/>Overall, while I found this to be a very watchable movie, I thought that it was a touch too over the top for my liking, and probably a little bit too long for a movie with this type of story. Interesting, though. Definitely an interesting alternative fantasy-history of Lincoln and his presidency, and what made him tick. (5/10)"
"Scarecrow-88","6","0","1","8 September 2013"," Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter
","I think sometimes what works well in a comic book doesn't necessarily translate effectively on screen. Mostly shot in sepia-toned dreary, saturated tones, Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter becomes beholden to a CGI dependency; like crack to an addict, Hollywood these days can't do without that visual effects fix. Abraham sees his mother fall to vampirism thanks to a rotten slave owner bloodsucker named Jack Barts (Marton Csokas). Barts is associated with New Orleans slave owner (and chief vampire), Adam (Rufus Sewell; he's reached that point where he reeks villainy from every pore, but he's typecast). Adam was responsible for the murder of the wife of vampire hunter, Henry (Dominic Cooper), and so Henry enlists the aid of twentys-year old Abraham (Benjamin Walker; a surprising lack of charisma, but it seems his look was more important in the casting of the role) to help him go after bloodsuckers. While some are good with ""weapons of iron"", Honest Abe is better at spinning and wielding a chopping ax. The chopping ax is a character of the film like Abe, and he can sure whip it aroundof course, this ax will be needed drastically if Abe is to survive the bloodsuckers and those extended mouths with all their sharp teeth. Part historical drama, part dark comic horror action, Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter tries to incorporate back story and Civil War elements with those nasty bloodsuckers imitating regular folks. This had me laughing: vampires support the Confederacy because Abe is the enemy of both. You have battle scenes where Confederates have vampires alongside them engaging the enemy. Henry has a secret Abe later learns, but Lincoln follows his orders towards vampires masquerading as commoners, using the ax as his weapon to behead them. Other friends of Lincoln (and eventually help him against his foes) include his first employer (a shop owner), Joshua Speed (Jimmi Simpson) and a slave he saved from the whip, Will Johnson (Anthony Mackie). There's a pivotal scene when Abe goes to rescue Will from Adam in his New Orleans mansion, certain to be the major ""Abe fights the vampires"" of the film, as well as, the finale on the train (where Adam is after the silver and we are led to believe Speed has betrayed Lincoln) where wooden tracks are set aflame. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is Mary Todd and her betrothal (and courting with) Abe is given importance; not to mention, their son's attack by Adam's evil henchwoman, Vadoma (Erin Wasson), which will later lead to Mary Todd getting her due justice. The obvious liberties are taken with Lincoln's life prior to his monumental presidency, and how (while President during one of America's most turbulent times in history) he still continues to kill vampires even after he's become President of the United States, but the sheer audacity of such an idea I give applause. Does it work? It is far-fetched and unrealistic but why wouldn't it be? The heavy use of CGI is what left me rather wanting, and the lead actor just never quite leaves a significant impression as Abraham Lincoln, one of the nation's most critical figures of history. Seeing the Union use silver to even the odds at Gettysburg, with vampires in Confederate uniforms meeting their ends, is equal parts amusing and rather thrilling."
"SnoopyStyle","6","0","1","1 September 2013"," The Title says it all
","The title says it all. You get not just the plot, but the style and the tone. Abraham Lincoln (Benjamin Walker) is not only a vampire hunter, but his life has been defined by vampires for a long time. His mother was killed by a vampire. As a young man, he tries to seek revenge but fails. But in the process, he meets Henry Sturgess (Dominic Cooper) who teaches him how to kill a vampire. During the Civil War as President of the United States, he comes to realize that vampires are fighting with the Confederate forces. As a result he mounts his own campaign to defeat them.<br/><br/>Benjamin Walker is not big enough to anchor this movie. For the lead, they really should have gotten a bigger name and a more compelling actor. There was some really slow moments in the middle, but a vampire threw a horse.... A HORSE. That's worth the money to see for the right audience. This is a ridiculous concept. It could have more fun moments like the horse."

","As a historian it is hard for me to like this movie, but I did find this an enjoyable movie. Not as good as Bram Stoker's Dracula with Gary Oldman, but still a pretty good vampire movie. The action is pretty good, the vampire hunting is excellent.<br/><br/>The pace of this movie pretty fast as we begin our story when Abraham loses his mother. She was poisoned by a Vampire named Barts. His father makes him promise not to go after Barts. Abraham promises but only keeps this promise until his father passes away.<br/><br/>The movie is different from the book as there are many things that have been changed. There is no mention of Abraham Lincoln's grandfather being killed by vampires. There is no mention of Anne Rutledge, although in the book she plays a major role but is killed in the same manner as Abraham's mother. Willie Lincoln's death in the movie is attributed to the same sickness that killed his grandmother.<br/><br/>Another scene that should have been in this movie was that John Wilkes Booth had been turned into a vampire. Abraham Lincoln was shot and his friend Henry turned him into a vampire instead of letting Lincoln die. However, Lincoln was turned at a time when nobody was around so everyone thought he was still dead.<br/><br/>The novel idea that Abraham Lincoln was a vampire hunter and had killed several vampires over the years is a pretty good idea. It is an amazing twist that the Civil War was fought to free the slaves because the vampires used slaves as food. It was not only humans that fought on the side of the south but vampires as well.<br/><br/>As a movie based on a book that is complete fiction wrapped around historical fact this is a very good movie. I would give this a 7 out of 10 stars, simply because the action and story is fairly well thought out. Timur Bekmambetov did a very good job directing this movie, and adapting it from the book of the same name. But, as a historian, I can't bring myself to like this movie too much."

","Now, Timur Bekmambetov is well known for the effects he uses in his movies and this is no exception. There is blood and gore all over the screen as death is meted out in many and varied ways, all in glorious slow motion. The trouble is we've already seen that kind of stuff before; there's nothing new or particularly innovative here. Yes, it's very well done; the effects guys did an excellent job; but I would have liked to have seen something different. The plot; again disappointing, it just followed well documented events in Lincoln's life and added a narrative that meant he had to do this or that to thwart the vampire hordes. Not exactly groundbreaking either. The performances were all pretty good although nobody really stood out and nobody looked like they were really stretched either. Over all I found it pretty disappointing; not quite as bad as 'Jonah Hex' (2010), but heading that way.<br/><br/>SteelMonster's verdict: NOT RECOMMENDED (Unless you're a die-hard vampire fan)<br/><br/>My score: 4.8/10<br/><br/>You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster."

The biggest flaw to get through here, despite the overlooking of history that this plays with, is the utterly atrocious CGI presented here for all the main action scenes which look so obvious that they're distracting to the overall scene. That this one has so much action as it does is where this one really gets all it's good points at once due to the overwhelming enjoyment they provide as this one has about as intense a collection of action scenes as many traditional genre movies with three stand-out, knock-out sequences that are just a pure blast to sit through. The violence is top-notch and really generates some gruesome moments, and the re-writing of history to suit it's own end is a rather fine notion and makes some sense in the context of the film, as there's not a whole lot of gaping holes to be found in the revisions which is nice, and overall this is quite a bit of fun if only for it's one flaw.<br/><br/>Rated R: Graphic Violence and Brief Nudity."

That night he goes after his mother, and when he wakes up he sees her apparently dying of small pox (actually ""milk poisoning,"" but we're not looking for historic accuracy here), but he knows that Barts is responsible for his death somehow. Years later as Abe enters adulthood for the first time, he vows revenge against his family's boss for the murder of his mother and gets drunk at a bar before killing him in order to give himself the courage to do so. Much to his surprise, his old boss can't be killed because he's one of the undead, specifically a vampire. But one man saves his life and nurses him back to health, then explains tells him what Barts really is. That man is Henry Sturgess, and Abe seeks his training to defeat the monster who killed his mother.<br/><br/>Sturgess warns him not to make any friends or seek the spotlight, something which fate has unfortunately made impossible. He also sends him to Springfield, Illinois where he takes a job as a shopkeeper run by Joshua Speed. During his time in Springfield, he slays a few vampires and meets the woman who would later become Mary Todd Lincoln, played by the obviously miscast Mary Elizabeth Winstead. Winstead is far too pretty to play Mrs. Lincoln. Hell, even Sally Field in her current state is too pretty to play Mrs. Lincoln. He also has a casual encounter with Stephen Douglas, the man he would later debate over the abolition of slavery. And once again, he is reunited with his old black childhood friend William Johnson, who is part of the underground railroad and fleeing bounty hunters who intend to sell him and the people he has been setting free.<br/><br/>Before killing the monster who made Abe's life a living hell, he reveals that Sturgess is a vampire too. Upon this discovery, Sturgess reveals that Adam, the man who made him the vampire he is killed his fiancé, and he's as determined to kill them as Abe, but can't do it because vampires can't kill their own.<br/><br/>As the country moves closer to Civil War, the vampires of the new world become more of a threat to the country, and to Lincoln himself. They kidnap Johnson, and Lincoln reveals his secret life to Speed so they can rescue him from the Adam's New Orleans plantation. Adam tries to make a deal with him to slay Sturgess instead, and naturally he rejects the deal as both rescued. According to this movie, Willie Lincoln died not from Typhoid, but from an attack by a vampire woman, and an associate of Adam at that. It's then that Mary discovers the truth about the her husband. Additionally, the north almost lost the Battle of Gettysburg because the Confederate Army had vampires as volunteers. <br/><br/>I don't think I'm going to reveal too much else, because real history is already known. But the way this movie, and the book on which it is based blends the supernatural into real history makes it quite the tale, especially in the way it integrates Abe's determination to wipe out slavery with vampires. It has been pointed out on many occasions that as Lincoln, Benjamin Walker looks a lot like Liam Neeson. But as Adam, Rufus Sewell is reminiscent of William Campbell in his days in that Star Trek episode ""The Squire of Gothos."" Try thinking of that reference."
"brando647","6","0","2","20 January 2013"," My Biggest Disappointment in Summer 2012
","I received Seth Grahame-Smith's novel for Christmas in 2011 and loved it. It perfectly blended the events of Lincoln's life with a new life as a vampire hunter in such a way that you could almost buy it as legit (if you have a loose grip on reality). It was portrayed as a secret journal Lincoln kept from his youth in which he documents the events of his life and how he came to be a vampire hunter and why it led to his interest in freeing the slaves in the Civil War. I was excited to find out, shortly after I finished the novel, that it was on the fast track to a movie adaptation from producer Tim Burton and director Timur Bekmambetov (WANTED). It was a perfect combo for the source material! The book was dark, suspenseful, and a gripping read. Well, the movie was none of these things. ABRAHAM LINCOLN: VAMPIRE HUNTER was turned into summer blockbuster schlock with mindless action and a modified plot that ruined or removed all the best parts of the novel. For those unfamiliar, everything you need to know about this movie is in the title. It's the story of Abraham Lincoln's secret life. Our country's beloved 16th president is famous for his Emancipation Proclamation but spent his free time hunting the undead. When a vampire murders his mother, Lincoln dedicates his life to avenging her and battling the undead threat. Under the tutelage of the mysterious Henry Sturges, Lincoln develops the skills necessary to engage his new enemies.<br/><br/>What bothers me most about the Burton/Bekmambetov adaption is how much it seems to veer away from the vibe of the novel. I understand that the script for the movie was written by Grahame-Smith (the original author) but even he seemed almost apologetic when I listened to his commentary for the film. In my opinion, he appeared to spend the entire movie trying to justify all the changes he made. No dice, Grahame-Smith. The changes were unnecessary and seem like pandering to the summer movie crowd in hopes of big box office cash. In a sense, he was successful because the movie made more than it's budget back in returns but it doesn't kill my disappointment. The action in the novel was brutal and fit the darker mood; the action in the movie is embellished and crazy with Lincoln running across the backs of stampeding horses or battling vampires on the roof of a speeding train. The writing and characters tried to take the material seriously (just as I'd hoped) but the events were so extreme that it bordered on campy. And what was the deal with Lincoln's almost supernatural abilities. There is nothing of the sort in the novel; Lincoln is just a normal man who trains his body and mind into peak condition. I know that's a lot to portray in a movie. That's what montages are for. We don't need to see Lincoln chopping a tree in half with a single swing. That's just stupid. I was hoping the movie would approach the premise and treat it as a ""what if this were true"" scenario and not as a semi-superhero tale.<br/><br/>I also didn't see the point in adding the additional characters. There was a lot to get across in this movie already without tossing in new characters to develop. I went in to the movie understanding that the movie would need to leave a lot out. The novel covers the majority of Lincoln's lifeway more than could fit into a movie running under two hours long. But don't waste time with new material when the original was great. Instead, we get Lincoln's best friend Will Johnson (Anthony Mackie), a freed slave, and vampire lord Adam (Rufus Sewell). I guess Johnson was tossed in so the audience would have an easy understanding of what led Lincoln to free the slaves and Adam was supposed to be a focus point for all the vampire villainy. In other words, over-simplifying everything for a movie audience. The novel worked perfectly without these characters dumbing things down. The novel had a more overwhelming vampire conspiracy threat with their agents everywhere while Adam merely sneers and hams for the camera. He's your generic action movie villain. But he's the big baddie and gives Lincoln someone to kill during a climactic final battle and that's what summer movies need, I suppose.<br/><br/>Anyway, fans of the novel are bound to be as disappointed in the movie as I was. Benjamin Walker was inspired casting as Lincoln. He was the smartest choice the filmmakers made. Mary Elizabeth Winstead didn't fit her role as Mary Todd. She's too adorable to be believable in the role, and the old age effects didn't work for her in the later parts of the film. Dominic Cooper has been scoring some major points as a rising star but I don't like his ""rock star"" version of Henry Sturges. I guess this was more a fault of the script, but I preferred the stoic mentor I remember from the novel. As far as its position as a summer movie, it's a stylish passable bit of entertainment. I was just hoping it'd have been a lot more."
"AW_RATLIFFHxC","4","0","2","29 December 2012"," Fact : This movie truly disappointed me
","I didn't read the book, so that's not why I was disappointed. I had to try really hard to ignore the "" fact"" that this movie was trying to remotely use any credible history of Abraham Lincoln. I think it did a better job convincing me of the possibility of real life vampires . I guess connecting a story about vampires to a very well know historical character helped bring needed curiosity to sell the movie, but they just didn't pull it off for me. The movie fell way too short for me on being either entertaining or enlightening . So if history means anything to you, this movie might get under your skin a bit.

","OK, first of all I haven'r read the book, but I know it is from the same writer that gave us pride and prejudice and zombies so I can easily say it has the same amount of silliness contained within. It is just that taking random pieces of history and rewriting them with supernatural is kind of a good idea, if done right. Not here. Lincoln vs the zombies is very...very stupid. Granted it has good special effects and some minor star power does not give it the gusto that you may expect from a one time flick. It does have some action, a little comic relief and some plot but it doesn't have anything else. It can be summed up as, boy knows vampires exist, boy learns how to fight them, he grows up, then becomes president(that is a spoiler, Abe Lincoln becomes a president) and fights some more vampires. Oh and he literally becomes the president in just one scene, it is like in five minutes its ten years later and he is running the country, civil war and all. And the south is so evil they employ vampires, too. In any case you can watch it with a couple friends and beer but there is not much fun to be had."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","4","0","2","17 December 2012"," ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" messes with history in messy fashion
","Twisting history can be amusing and in some cases even insightful. Seth Grahame-Smith aimed for both with his book, ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,"" but his film version doesn't exactly achieve the balancing act. <br/><br/>Understandably, history takes a back seat in ""Vampire Hunter,"" but rather than go with a Gothic action approach to the vampire side of things, 20th Century Fox hired Timur Bekmambetov, who employs his hyper-stylized technique, which renders the film into a truly schizophrenic affair. It's a gritty revenge tale mixed with campy horror and philosophical undertones about freedom.<br/><br/>Newcomer Benjamin Walker was an excellent choice to play Lincoln, and had he been cast in a non-fiction biopic, he would've excelled. He makes a downright convincing older Lincoln, the president/man we know him as, but obviously, that's not the focal point of ""Vampire Hunter."" Still, Walker's not so bad with an axe. He will remind many of Liam Neeson, an actor capable of both action and drama, who had this been 15-20 years ago, would've been a great fit for the part.<br/><br/>The core of this version of Lincoln is defined by the death of Lincoln's parents at the hand of vampires. After saving his childhood friend (Anthony Mackie) from abuse, Lincoln unknowingly got his dad mixed up with a vampire. When that vampire claims his parents' lives, he grows up seeking revenge but knows not what he is getting himself into. With the help of another vampire hunter named Henry (Dominic Cooper), Abe trains himself with an axe to become a vampire hunter and dedicates himself to the profession despite being purely motivated by revenge.<br/><br/>Lincoln would rather moonlight as a slayer of the undead, however, and can't help but fall for a local girl in Springfield named Mary Todd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and pursue other ambitions, namely studying to be a lawyer and flirting with the idea of politics. But delivering rousing speeches and slaying vampires is a tough balancing act that costs him dearly.<br/><br/>And that problem is mirrored by the film. With its priorities on telling the vampire side of Lincoln's life, it glazes over everything else in terms of motivation and ambition. We are to go entirely off of what we know about Lincoln from the real books, which ends up to be a big mistake on Grahame-Smith's part in his screenplay. Although he is mindful of the real Lincoln and cleverly twists the real timeline to fit his vampire mythology, when the film fast-forwards to older Lincoln in the final act, we have no real sense of the character and how he has internally been able to reconcile his public and private lives.<br/><br/>It sounds like that's asking too much of a film called ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,"" and in a sense that's true. As he did with ""Wanted,"" Bekmambetov delivers action and gore that will smack a stupid grin on your face whether you like it or not. It would just be nice if there was a little more effort put into linking the different element of the story in a more cohesive manner. Doing so would've at least enhanced the stakes of the plot, which won't elicit any kind of emotion.<br/><br/>""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" doesn't take itself too seriously, but it overestimates how much its audience will appreciate its rhetoric as found in the narration. The idea of how history remembers events a specific way and leaves out certain details about the sacrifice involved is quite valid, but amidst the slow-motion baton twirling of an axe, it only has so much of an impact.<br/><br/>Bekmambetov's reliance on digital effects also ruins how effective the movie can be, as much as it does make it ""cool"" at times. Films set in the 1800s usually don't have this problem, but it is here. The style of the action is clearly valued over the style that would best suit the film as a whole. Even then, the budget allows for only a mediocre use of CGI at best, or at least that's the impressive some of the effects shots give off. In today's blockbuster market, you ca't ever afford to look cheap, and ""Vampire Hunter"" includes too many cheap-looking effects shots. Some sequences benefit from a cartoony quality, but most don't.<br/><br/>Butchering history (even literally) shouldn't automatically discredit how seriously a film should be taken, but the decision to take factual liberties should at least be based in some creative justification. The mere concept of ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" seems like enough to warrant creative freedom, but the film just doesn't capture that spirit the way you hope something so absurd-sounding would.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

"moviesrme10","5","0","2","16 December 2012"," The Author of the book wrote the script - he most not have liked the book he wrote
","Hum this film is OK. Its well i don't really know i sm a bit mixed here. This film had good moments and then bad moments but as you can see the bad moments were a bit more strong then the good moments sadly. The bad moments include the running time,script,faithfulness,confusing,and much more. The running time is just short , the film needed more time for Abe's life to better unfold, we learn nothing of his suffering actually, in the book he suffers horribly in the movie his son's death is the only sad part. This film needed a longer running time or cutting down some of the stupid footage like Mary Todd shooting the vampire girl, they could have made a part 2 and had her in it and more suffering for Abe and it would have been better. That helps me to move in to my next subject with the faithfulness to the great book. This film just like The City Of Ember , is not faithful, it uses maybe acouple characters and the main idea which is Abraham Lincoln Vampire Killer and thats about it. Most characters are new, if they are not then the characters took out of the book have been given the same name just different stories which is just not good not good at all. I was sad with it, it jumped about 50 pages each scene making it very confusing and might i say stupid which i just don't understand being the fact that the person who wrote the book wrote the script for this movie which inda gets me wondering why would he get rid of all those characters and add new ones skipping through the book so fast it is speedy, i think he thought he was writing a sort of revised Abraham, maybe a new won but why do that he could have made a decent two part movie and made lots of money. That leads me into my next discussion, on the script. The script is well as i all ready talked about disappointing it really was being the author of the book wrote the movie script. He i guess thought little of the book he wrote himself and wanted to rewrite it, well here was his chance to- big mistake. This films script had a huge chance of doing well if the author cared more about the book. This movie is very very confusing , as i said before it jumps about 50 pages and it just does not fit well. Stuff is pushed way to hard ,way way to hard. Now onto the good stuff including the visual effects, cast, and the acting. This film's visuals are by far some of the most magnificent visuals i have seen this whole year, i'm not lying this is in my top two with Life of Pi. Every scene that includes visual effects look beautiful and great. Everything in this film look polished and cleaned and well just so Pretty to look at i mean it is just great. The visual effects were put in the hands of really good people because they made it look real yet something from a wild dream. I just wanted to watch the special effects alone for a long time. The cast was well cast, Rufus Sewell,Mary Elizabeth Winstead , and Anthony Mackie are the highlights but Benjamin Walker was a great casting choice for Abraham Lincoln, he looks and sounds like Abe would have , this film was just perfectly cast. The acting was great as well , Mary Elizabeth Winstead was just great to watch and our new Abe Lincoln was also a delightfully talented actor he was. All an All you can tell that everyone involved in this film tried their best (but the author himself Seth Grahame-Smith) this film just was not given the right script to deliver the film. C-"
"timdalton007","4","0","2","12 December 2012"," When A Good Premise Goes Astray
","Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter seemed destined to be a good film. It was based on a New York Times bestseller with a fantastic central idea that wonderfully blended real history with the supernatural. It seemed even more so since the writer behind the novel was adapting it for the screen. Yet as a film, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter seems to be lacking what made its book counterpart so good.<br/><br/>Before delving into the main problem with the film, let's look at the casting. At first, most of the casting works especially Benjamin Walker's Abraham Lincoln and Mary Elizabeth Winstead's Mary Todd both of whom do well. It's when the characters age that they run into trouble. Be it the laughable makeup to age them up or their performances I'm not sure, but what I am sure of is that the two of them are utterly unconvincing once the film makes its jump to Lincoln being elected and heads towards its conclusion. More successful are Dominic Cooper as Lincoln's vampire hunting mentor Henry Sturges and Rufus Sewell as the over the top vampire villain Adam. There is one character that is ill served by the film which is Anthony Mackie's Will Johnson but more on him later. The cast overall then is good for the most part, if a bit off after a point.<br/><br/>The production values are mixed as well. Between the production design François Audouy and the cinematography of Caleb Deschanel, the film looks rather good. Audouy's sets do fairly convincing takes on early to mid-1800s America but while Deschanel's cinematography gives the film a polished and sleek look. Sadly other parts of the film don't hold up as well, especially the frequent and mainly unconvincing CGI work that hampers two of the films biggest action sequences. The film is also hurt to a certain extent by its editing which causes sections of the film (including action sequences shockingly) to drag. The results are mixed at best.<br/><br/>Where the film really lacks though is in the script. Seth Grahame-Smith adapted his own novel into the script but frankly it could have been anyone. While initially faithful for the most part (if only in its broad strokes), the film diverges more and more as it goes on often to its detriment (there's a plot twist later in the film involving one of the character's that is revealed immediately upon that character's introduction in the novel). After Lincoln becomes President though, Grahame-Smith seems to have thrown out his own book for the most part, especially in the transparently obvious and over the top climax to the film. It also doesn't help the film that there's a new and completely unnecessary character (Anthony Mackie's Will Johnson) crudely inserted into it, something that hurts both the actor's performance and the film as a whole. One of the novel's pluses was that it blended fact and fiction into what was ""plausible"" while the film (and shockingly the writer of both) seem to have forgotten that. The result is a cool premise (and a good book) that is torn to shreds for reasons that aren't quite clear.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the film version of Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is a disappointment. It forgets what made the book work so well and tries to bury it under an ill-fitting action move skin and casting that initially works and then doesn't. If you've read the book, skip the movie. If you haven't read the book, go read it. As a wise man once said: ""The book is much better."""
"poe426","1","0","2","4 December 2012"," Lincoln be stinkin'...
","The notion of Civil War-era vampires is nothing new (see the xlibris book THE NIGHT RIDERS for my own personal take on just such a scenario)- but it HAS been handled better (see the xlibris book THE NIGHT RIDERS...). From the looks of things, a great deal of money was spent on this one. Not much of a return on such a big investment, if you ask me. While it might've made a decent manga, it's not much of an anime (which it is, because most of the action is cgi). In THE NIGHT RIDERS, we learn that a slave ship from Africa has unleashed an ancient evil on these shores. The story works as metaphor, something ABRAHAM LINCOLN: VAMPIRE HUNTER doesn't even ATTEMPT; it's just one more expensive cgi cartoon hardly worth the time it takes to sit through."
"denis888","1","0","3","29 November 2012"," Utterly Silly
","Awful movie. Point. Everything here is laughable and bland, pointless and bad. Bad playing, terrible and repeated effects, bad soundtrack, very naive plot twists, funny scenery and especially stupid depiction of Civil War battles. As we say in Russia, President Lincoln is fidgeting in his coffin, knowing how insipidly poor and terrible bad film Timur Bekmanbetov made up again. What can I say? The plots never really collide in the film, as if the real story and all that vampire stuff simply exist on different levels, no matter how much Timur was trying to gel them. It never did. I never was involved into the storyline, and found myself grinning in utter disbelief all the time while watching that horror of a film. My advice is - do not waste your time on this lowest-rate film, this is poorly executed and vapidly performed flick. Just save 2 hours of you life on for something better"
"estreet-eva","6","0","1","28 November 2012"," Like the book-better than the title would suggest
","Seth Graheme-Smith's central premise - that slavery represented a boon for vampires and one that they were willing to fight for on the confederate side of the U.S. civil war - works unexpectedly well. The movie plays out the more goofy part of the notion - that Abraham Lincoln fought them individually and later collectively as President - as a straight-up action movie in line with ""Air Force One"" and the like. Some reviewers have faulted the film for an overly serious tone but given the campy nature of the concept itself, this taking itself seriously also works well. Basically, adding to the camp factor would have produced an annoying trifle rather than a watchable, if limited, American action picture. While the protagonists (Benjamin Walker as Old Abe and others) come across as fairly bland and serious, the vampire characters come across as menacing and, pardon the pun, bloody-thirsty particularly Erin Wasson as an evil seductress. (where was she when they were casting Catwoman?). The battles they fight although implausible (including on top of a train falling into a canyon) do make for some entertaining action sequences. In short, a popcorn movie worth a discount rental, just try not to think about how fighting something with the ability to turn invisible would pretty much be a non-starter (unless they had a really powerful smell)."

I thought the actors did a good job with what they had to work with but there was just something lacking. I saw this in 3D and I very quickly got tired of all the sparkly little dust motes and bits of pollen that were floating through the air in virtually every scene, not to mention the copious amounts of blood splatter. I know, I know, its a vampire flick, of course there's going to be blood splatter. But when it's used as much as it was in this movie, it loses its impact. A little would have gone a long way."

","Man, what were they smoking? Based on the best-selling novel, this little film was brought to life by the dark vision of Tim Burton of all people and what we got was the story of the supposed secret life of our sixteenth president Abraham Lincoln. Personally, I still find the concept of old honest Abe hacking his way through some creepy-looking vampires rather ridiculous. Sure, I can take cowboys fighting dinosaurs or aliens, but at least those make a lot more sense than this film and are therefore more interesting.<br/><br/>Anyway, is this movie bad? Well, not really because I've seen worse. Much worse. The story, as silly as it is, is pretty interesting and it ties in pretty well with significant historical moments in Lincoln's life. The vampires themselves are actually pretty scary at times and the action scenes are entertaining. The cast was surprising like Mary-Elizabeth Winstead, Dominic Cooper, Benjamin Walker, etc., performing quite well and doing a decent job conveying emotions. The rest is pretty much downhill as most of the characters are not that special, the villains are not very interesting, the plot again is pretty silly, a few things left me confused, and there are some inconsistencies and plot holes throughout the film.<br/><br/>Overall, I wasn't genuinely impressed, then again I didn't expect much from a film like this, but at least I got some good out of this movie. Not really recommended, but if you want to throw reality out the window and have a good time, then check this out. Otherwise, skip this one before it drains the fun out of you like the blood-sucking monsters in this movie."

","Films can't get more high concept, and its about as serious as Gandhi the zombie Slayer or Nelson Mandela the werewolf catcher.

However the fact that this film hitches its plot on real events and the sheer guts of the cast to keep a straight face gives this film a strange charm. There is much to dislike but as a rainy Sunday afternoon film there is enough meat to entertain."
"Vartiainen","Null","0","1","26 November 2012"," Great basic idea, boring execution
","On the paper this film sounds great. One of the most iconic presidents of all time traveling across the early USA, killing vampires with an axe-shotgun and taking names. Sure it's corny and over the top, but sometimes that's exactly what we need to be entertained.<br/><br/>On some levels, this film delivers exactly what it promises. There is a lot of fighting and many action scenes, which are usually very solid and entertaining. Especially the numerous slow-motion shots were very pleasing to look at in my opinion, though that's just my personal cup of tea, as I know that some don't like them at all. Guess I haven't gotten my fair fill of them yet. Additionally, the lore and mythos of this film manage to work on a reasonable level. The vampires aren't anything special, but they're not laughably erroneous either, like some others I could mention if I wasn't sure that you all already know which vampires I'm talking about. So the action and the vampires do work. Sure some of the action scenes are a bit too... outlandish and hard to take seriously, but I wasn't really expecting anything else, so it didn't bother me all that much. Add in some nice period costumes and a decent, though a tad forgettable score, and the film has a nice basic framework all set up.<br/><br/>So what went wrong? Well, the movie is pretty boring for one, which is astonishing given that it's a film about Abraham Lincoln. Killing vampires. With an axe-shotgun. In slow-motion. For that concept to end up being boring is just plain wrong, but unfortunately it's the truth. The actors all do a decent job, but the characters that they play are colourless, without any characteristics aside from a few initially established quirks. One of them is a womanizer, one of them is a bit naive, one of them is evil, and that's about it. Furthermore, the story isn't all that exciting either. Yet again it's not bad, but it's just... colourless. No creativity, no original ideas, no soul. It's there to move the film from one action scene to another, nothing more.<br/><br/>And really, in some movies the nonexistent story can be forgiven, especially if their purpose is to be nothing more than an action-packed slugfest. But usually those movies are self-conscious about the lack of story and compensate by being extremely flashy and showboating. This film however actually seems to believe that it has a worthwhile story to tell and thus tries it hardest, making it ever so worse in the process.<br/><br/>So to whom I might recommend this film? Well, if vampire films are your thing and you've resigned yourself to the fact that the story isn't going to be anything special, then I think that there are worse ways to spend an hour or two. This movie isn't terrible by any means, and for the fans of fantasy action it's even somewhat decent. If only the story had had a bit more originality, then this might have become a great guilty pleasure for me."

","Disclaimer: I have never read the book, nor heard of it prior to seeing this movie last night with my partner.<br/><br/>The exaggeratedly surreal and over-the-top sensationalism of the film left me intrigued. Wanting more? Not particularly, but stillThe overall concept for the film was unique. If you take in to consideration all the tripe Hollywood is producing these days, the idea that our 16th President was not only fighting for equality for all people, but was also hunting down and destroying vampires – yes, I was intrigued. Why not? This couldCOULD play-out as a rather ""original"" idea – solely on the merit of entertainment for entertainment sake.<br/><br/>This movie seemed to refuse to take itself seriously, which I liked. It bent vampire myths, added a few new things to the mix and left the viewer to either hate it, or switch off their brain and just enjoy the visual onslaught of utter nonsense. I took the latter road while watching.<br/><br/>Sure, if I wanted to rip the movie apart, I could do just that. If you just look at some of the scenes depicted in the film: Jumping on the backs of horses during a raging stampede, the idea of vampires being so ""advanced"" in the 1800's to use sunscreen as a means of going out in the daylight, the fighting styles presented in the film, the entire end battle sequence on the train.I'm just saying, I could spend plenty of words on deconstructing and brutalizing this film. But I digress I left it to be nothing more than purely ""popcorn"" fun and let it rest."

","Just that. I went with my wife and of course i did not expect an bafta winner movie..but that picture is lame, dumb and pathetic. The sequence inside the horse stampede seems to be made by pre-adolescents and no mention for the final ""action"" sequence, the one in the train slipping and jumping in the air. Simply stupid. Usually my point of view and critic side is positive and benevolent, i just try to take out the best of a film, book, song, TV show...whatever, but this film make believe that GI JOE Rise of the Cobra was a ideal monument to perfection. I can't believe that the actual descendants of Mr Lincoln give the permission (altought is a literary adaptation) to let ""the mother of Abraham Lincoln"" being sucked and killed by a vampire. Sad movie, sad me for expending money in the tickets, sad adaptation."

","I just have to wonder what kind of thought process went on in Hollywood where anyone thought this was a good idea.<br/><br/>Technically, it's a masterfully crafted film. The dialog is kind of sharp, the plot moves along, the special effects are seamless into the film (although the final sequence is WAAAAAAY over the top.) But the real offense of this movie is that it take probably one of history's greatest figures, and turns him into a cheap action figure. Why not ""Ghandi, Zombie Slayer"" or ""Martin Luther King: Werewolf Killer!"" Because those WOULD be offensive. Lincoln is sufficiently remote where you can do a mashup between the real man and a cheap action hero, and no one gets nearly as offended as they should.<br/><br/>The Confederacy was evil because it held on to the notion that one person owning another was acceptable when everyone realized it wasn't. You don't need some silly nonsense about vampires in there.<br/><br/>On a side note, the vampires themselves are cartoonish. I mean, I guess we can be glad they are portraying them as monsters after their emasculation by movies like Twilight."

","I read the book first myself. The book was great, I couldn't wait to watch the movie. Well...that didn't last long...the first 10 minutes of the movie tell you right away that it is not even following the book. You keep going, further in and find out that the movie doesn't follow the book or plot in any way. It was terrible. They just took the name of the movie, and the names of some of the characters and that is is. They created their own plot and story that was unrelated to the book and changed everything. Henry was one of my favorite characters in the book and they just slaughtered everything about him.<br/><br/>If I hadn't read the book first, I would probably thought it was a decent movie...nothing great. If they would have just followed the storyline and plot of the book itself, it could have been SO much better.<br/><br/>Overall, if you read the book...I do not suggest watching the movie...it just destroys it."

","Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter<br/><br/>The idea that Lincoln fought vampires is more credible than assertions that he cared about slaves.<br/><br/>And while this horror movie doesn't speak to the mendacity of Lincoln, it does present other inaccuracies.<br/><br/>Before his presidency, Lincoln (Benjamin Walker) attacks the man who killed his mother. Unbeknownst to him, that man is a vampire.<br/><br/>Fortunately, a vampire hunter (Dominic Cooper) comes to his aid, and, over time, eventually teaches Lincoln how to slay.<br/><br/>Maintaining his momentum towards the White House, Lincoln marries Mary Todd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and has a son.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, his hope of ending slavery threatens the vampire's food source, as well as a powerful vampire's (Rufus Sewell) desire to infect the nation.<br/><br/>While it's an obvious work of fantasy, its somber tone and deadpan acting removes any potential of camp value.<br/><br/>In addition to ending vampire food supplies, abolishing slavery would also impact Thomas Jefferson's love life.

","I'm going to start with the usual clichés, if you have read the book give this film a HUGE miss......because it is garbage!! If you haven't read the book then this film is actually really good!! <br/><br/>You have to ignore the so many ""but, wait a minute.."" moments in this, I presume the director (and ironically the writer of the book as well who was either a producer or director, i forget) both couldn't be bothered with trying to follow a story that worked so well in the book!!<br/><br/>Well that's me done, cant think of anymore clichés, just don't read the book but enjoy the film ;-)"
