"jmchnwth","10","295","326","7 January 2006"," This is a fantastic movie....
","This is a fantastic movie because no matter what side you're on in life, this movie shows them all, good and bad, right or wrong. I also agree with the point in the movie that proves that people can change for the better and straighten things out in their head to do the right things in life. Yes, things in our world have changed, some for the good, some for the bad, but just because you might not agree with some of it, doesn't mean you can play God and try to make things ""your way"" and this shows exactly what happens when you try. This movie talks about all walks of life and the struggles we all have in what beliefs are right and wrong. Yes this movie is brutal and violent, but also truthful to the past and unfortunately still sometimes the present. This movie is about race, but not only 1 race is singled out and fed to the dogs, they all are. So, go into this movie with an open mind and your mind will come out full."
"exa56","10","265","308","26 January 2006"," A masterpiece! Truly one of the best film I have ever seen
","I have been wanting to see this movie for a long time, since my English teacher mentioned it in our class in grade ten. Gosh I wished I wouldn't have waited all this time to finally watch it, although maybe it's a good thing cause I would have probably been a little bit more traumatized at 14... This movie is exceptional!!! Makes u think, makes you frustrated, makes you wanna scream and even makes you cry! Edward Norton is just phenomenal playing the role of a freak skin head and even more so playing this skin head who finally realizes how stupid he was and tries to protect his younger brother. Edward Furlong also does an amazing job!!! This film is moving in so many ways...I can't even describe how real and heartfelt it felt. I definitely think Edward Norton should have won the Oscar for his performance, cause he was absolutely terrific! I can't get why they didn't gave it to him... This movie will surely stay on my mind for a while now... just thinking that some place in the world things like that still happen...it crushes my heart. This is a wonderful movie that every single person should see at least once in his life... Watch American History X, it totally worth it!"
"alexkolokotronis","10","122","139","1 February 2009"," The Most Dangerous Person To Us Is Ourselves
","American History X is a movie of its own. It has a little bit of everything in the way it touches you. This of course making it a very though provoking film. There isn't a genre you can place this film in because it is a not a crime story, action or even a simple drama instead it is a humanistic thriller. What it is about, is the battle over ourselves.<br/><br/>Who better than to display these wild but common complexities within people than Edward Norton. The range he shows here is astounding in only his fifth movie. Norton plays Derek Vinyard, a skin head that realizes through cruel yet necessary events in his life that he has gone down the wrong path. When he comes out of jail he attempts to stop his brother played Edward Furlong from going down the same road he had done. Through all his efforts though some things just prove to be inevitable. Avery Brooks also gives a great performance as Derek Vinyard's former teacher and now principal of his former school. His words may not be of the most inspiring but his actions and messages sent across are subtle yet strong and to the point.<br/><br/>Norton's performance though wasn't just about range but exploring different dimensions of life. Whether it proved to be psychological, social or even political on a certain level. It is a transforming performance revealing something mind blowing and eye opening. That we, and this includes anyone, can take a devastating turn in life no matter how intelligent we are or thoughtful. That the person that determines the outcome of your life is yourself whether it is good or bad. Norton's realizations aren't through teachings such as the ones that got him in jail but they are through the events in the time he spent in jail. He saw the truth for himself realizing then what is false and what is real.<br/><br/>The screenplay written by David McKenna is about as versatile as the performance Norton gives. Not only because of the Derek Vinyard character but because of the characters involved in his life. For example the root of his evil did not come from the murder of his father but rather his father himself. Through just a conversation at breakfast did his negative thoughts get really embedded eventually then leading to them dramatically taking over his mind and way of life. Only when his father got killed did these negative thoughts seem justified. The way this screenplay and direction was able to display this message in just a plethora of other underlying tones was spectacular.<br/><br/>What makes this movie great though is that you can truly find yourself in the messages delivered. As much as the main character might not seem relevant or connected to many people it his emotions and functioning of his mind that all of us are able to connect with. Yet what makes a movie great is not simply the message or messages sent across but how powerfully they are delivered. American History X delivers its multiple and intertwining messages about as powerfully as I've seen from a film."
"seventhsamurai1954","10","65","73","7 August 2005"," Changed My Life.
","American History X really opened my eyes to the world of racism and how cruel human beings can be sometimes. This story follows a violent extreme skin-head (Norton) that spends three years in jail for killing two black people and how he changed through jail. He then tries to help his younger brother, who idolizes him, not to go down the same path he did. You really can't find a more powerful movie than this. This movie forces you to open your eyes through harsh realism and although some things are disturbing, it makes you take notice. Everything about this movie is so incredible I can't even find words for it. All I can say is that if you have not seen this movie, it really is a must to see because it teaches you something and is really powerful.<br/><br/>Norton's best performance and a must for everyone."

","I give this movie a 10 because<br/><br/>1) Edward Norton was the meaning of masterful acting, you could just look at his eyes and understand every little pain he felt and caused. His smile and manner switching before and after was so distinguishing that if you did not speak English you could just follow him.<br/><br/>2) cinematography : not only the black and white phase was amazing some other shots was masterful<br/><br/>3) the cause , I watched this movie in 2019 and it is as important and as relevant as it was 21 years ago"
"Boba_Fett1138","10","394","488","19 July 2005"," One of the most powerful movies I have ever seen.
","I was expecting a kind of a moralistic movie with an overly present, almost preaching like message. The movie however turned out to be extremely powerful mainly due to the professionalism it was made with.<br/><br/>The movie its story is told 'beautifuly' in black & white and color. The quite original directing from Tony Kaye gives the movie a nice visual style and certain atmosphere. The story itself isn't that complicated or extremely original on its own and perhaps at most points even predictable but the way the story is told is phenomenal. This is not a movie with an happy ending or a movie that provides a solution to the racial discrimination problems. It shows what is NOT the solution to the problems and that everything that is occurring is like a vicious circle. The movie does not give a hopeful message but instead shows the dangers and pain you're causing to yourself and your close environment when you're thinking as a white supremacist.<br/><br/>As an anti Neo-Nazi movie this movie works really powerful. I think that its a really good and important thing that this movie is often shown in classrooms.<br/><br/>Edward Norton is truly fantastic in his role. He is very well believable as a Neo-Nazi as well as the reformed person he later turns into in the movie. It's almost like he's playing 2 different characters and he does that so extremely well. Also really good was Edward Furlong who we all long had not seen in a big production. Furlong and Norton are both acting well together in their scene's are highly believable as two brothers.<br/><br/>Also surprising good was the musical score by Anne Dudley who had already won an Oscar for ""The Full Monty"", the year before.<br/><br/>This was a movie that surprisingly impressed me. As a movie its extremely powerful and important.<br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"jerry_bear33","Null","476","648","2 April 2000"," An amazing film
","A good friend of mine suggested this film, and I really didnt know what to expect going in, but after this film was over, I sat in stunned silence. I knew that racism was horrible, but I found through this film that it does not come without a terrible price..the loss of love, friends, family...and the realization that everything that you believed to be true isnt always the way things are. Edward Norton's performance takes the viewer through this journey, and its not a pretty one. He goes from an bright young man, to a vengeful bigot, to a remorseful excon with a brothers life in jeopardy, and you feel as though you are looking in on someones life in the course of 2 hrs. All of the acting in this film is first rate, and the ending wasnt quite as predictable as others might have you believe...it is quite shocking, as is much of the film. It causes quite a debate on the way people view others whos skin color is not the same. As Dr. King said, judge me not on the color of my skin, but on the content of my character. I live with racism, because I am a black man living in America...it exists, but if we educate ourselves like the main character in AHX, it wont stay around for much longer. Hopefully it wont be too late, as it was for him. Peace and Love, JB33  Rating 5 stars"
"Anonymous_Maxine","10","313","435","28 August 2000"," Edward Norton delivers a staggering performance as an extremely intelligent white supremacist who realizes the wrongness of his views and must then try to prevent his younger brother form going down the same
","American History X is one of the most powerful movies released in years. Not since Schindler's List has the subject of racism been so potently presented. The use of black and white cinematography to portray painful flashbacks is amazing, and the settings, while not necessarily pretty, fit the story flawlessly. <br/><br/>Derek Vineyard's (Edward Norton) transition from a white supremacy leader's protege to a gang leader himself to a changed man is shown mainly through a series of flashbacks to the time before he was sent to prison. The character development and story are amazingly well done, and this is largely a factor of the high quality of the acting. Edward Norton especially, but also Edward Furlong, Beverly D'Angelo, and all of the rest of the cast down to Avery Brooks as Bob Sweeney, the African American high school teacher who comes up with the term American History X, and Stacy Keach as the wonderfully hateable Cameron Alexander. Keach, by the way, would have been the perfect choice to play Francis Dolarhyde in Manhunter, the film the precedes The Silence of the Lambs, but oh well. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, despite the fact that American History X is one of the best films in years, it is horribly underrated. Much like Norton's last film, Primal Fear, which was also a great movie, this movie did not get nearly the recognition that it deserves."
"Movie_Buff_Brad","10","15","17","16 July 2007"," One of the best films about racism
","One of the reasons I like the film is that the racism isn't shoved down your throat. It's subtle and believable. There's no characters standing around screaming about ""Those goddamn Mexicans, I don't want THEM changing my locks so THEY can rob the place with their little essays!"", right in front of them. <br/><br/>The acting is great all around, and Edward Norton gives one of the best performances of all time. I can't believe he didn't win best actor. While I haven't seen Benji's performance, I doubt he was half as good as Norton. The film is also highly inspirational and moving. <br/><br/>How is it that this wasn't even nominated for best picture, while Crash was AND won? Crazy.<br/><br/>This should be shown in schools."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","10","68","92","27 January 2004"," Why can't we just stop hating each other?
","This movie, got to me! I mean got under my skin got to me. It is so effective, the performances were just perfect. We have Edward Norton and Edward Furlong, two fine actors, they play two skin head Nazi racist brothers who are very violent. We start off at a very disturbing scene where we see how Edward Norton's character is put in jail for killing an African American very violently. When he comes back, he has just learned so much that no school, no white man could ever teach him: self respect, respect for others, respect for life, for his family, and knowing that ""We can't live our lives p*ssed off"". He is touched when he learns that his brother's teacher is asking him to write a paper about racism and how it effects today's society called ""American History X"". But when Eddie just gives a wrong look to the black kid in school, some things go terribly wrong.<br/><br/>First off, Ed Norton's old ""friends"" turn on him because he wishes not to be part of their very racist gang. Even his own brother who followed his footsteps hates him for turning on the gang. But Ed Norton takes Eddie and tells him his passionate and harrowing experience in prison. Eddie seems to start to see the light, but there is an extremely powerful ending that will make even the toughest guy shed a tear. I highly, very much highly, recommend this movie for everyone. Even for the kids, though you might want to turn them away for a few scenes, but that's how powerful this movie is. Trust me, this movie should not be missed and it sends a message.<br/><br/>10/10"
"Ari-21","10","623","935","9 December 1998"," This was probably the best movie I've ever seen
","I honestly don't think I have ever seen a better movie than American History X in my entire life! I may only be 14, but I have seen a lot of movies. I am an avid fan of them, and this one just takes the cake. Edward Norton is just unbelievable. He is the most talented actor I've ever laid eyes on. His performance in the movie is phenomenal. He delves so deep into his character that he can convince the whole audience easily of his neo-nazi role. The look on his face as he walks back from killing one man in the first seen is purely horrifying. The entire move was dramatic, intriguing, and powerful. It really is moving and emotional as well as scary. It is so true to life, and provides the viewer with such insight into the life and events that create a monster such as Derek Vinyard. It answers many questions I have long awaited an answer to such as what could possibly make someone act as Derek did in this movie, yet left open-ended many others that people such as myself may have. Almost every single scene in the movie was extremely captivating. I can't even go on to say more about the acting, other than if Edward Norton does not win best actor this year, I will go absolutely nuts. It's bad enough he lost it to Cuba Gooding Jr. when he was in Primal Fear, which was yet another incredible performance by him. Edward Furlong, the little kid from T2 is astounding as the confused brother of Derek. I was stunned walking out of the theater after seeing American History X, and I don't think I will ever have the benefit of seeing another movie as good as this one as long as I live. I recommend anyone with a good tolerance for violent and graphic depictions go see this movie. I am bewildered as to why director Tony Kaye would ever want out of this success. If I were to rate this movie, as I often do for others in reviewing them for school, I would give it an A+ with all of my heart."

"dmaul711","Null","210","323","19 April 2000"," Controversial, yet very amazing & moving film
","When I first heard of ""American History X,"" I thought it was going to be ""just another movie."" Man, was I wrong! The first time I watched it, I sat there as it ended, and I was just completely in a state of shock. This movie, more than any other movie I had seen on the subject of racism, really made me think twice about how I treated people of a different race. The way that Derek Vinyard's family was almost completely split apart and destroyed due to his racist beliefs should be a wake-up call to those people who have any racist beliefs whatsoever. I believe that this movie was a whole lot more than just a ground-breaking, controversial drama; it was a portrayal of exactly how much damage can be done to a family and a nation simply because of the hate for a person or people of a different color, for almost no reason at all. The Bible says that ""God created man in his own image."" It also says to, ""Love your neighbor as yourself,"" which, right there, implies that racism is not something people should even consider. I wouldn't recommend that anyone under the age of 16 see this movie due to its graphic content and language; however, I believe that everyone who is over the age of 16, should see this movie at least once. This way, more people will get a chance to see the true consequences of racism, and how it can easily tear apart a family."

","''American History X''is one of the most amazing movies I watched in my life! My dad gave me the tape to watch, and after almost 2 weeks of laziness to watch this movie, I finally watched it 2 times! First, I need to say that both Edwards( Norton and Furlong)are great! Edward Norton specially REALLY looks a skinhead, showing all his anger and awesome body in this movie.<br/><br/>I like the end of this movie (who is very sad by the way, since I liked the character Danny very much)showing how hate and violence only makes even more hate and violence, in a effect like a snowball.The other ending that never was filmed, in which Derek shaves his head again in the school bathroom,would not help very much with a good message, but it could have some sense, showing that the prejudice and the racism will continue no matter what we try to solve it. (But it is too pessimistic!)<br/><br/>I don't think this movie is racist like many people are saying. It is against racism, since the moral of the story was to show how the prejudice of all races and ethnicities only can make problems and anger for everybody.<br/><br/>It's funny to see how many goofs we have in this movie. I didn't pay attention to any of them, since the story itself makes you not bother with errors."
"vanillabeach","8","178","274","7 November 2001"," American Neo-Nazi gets a wake-up call
","Edward Norton plays Derek Vinyard, a violent but also intelligent neo-nazi. After brutally killing two black people who tried to break into his car, Derek is sent down for a couple of years. Meanwhile, his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) is busy following in his brother's footsteps. After certain incidents in prison gives him time to thing, Derek decides to reform on his way out. Once out, he realises how quickly in number his old gang of nazi thugs has grown and wonders if he can save his brother.<br/><br/>This is a brilliant film. Perhaps what disturbs me the most is the way that Edward Norton looks so brutal, yet sounds so intellectual throughout the film.<br/><br/>Although the film contains a constant strong theme of violence, it is always justified in portraying a picture of racial tension. Neither black nor white people are ""judged"" in the film, it's primary focus being to outline that it's people's brutality that causes a racial divide, not race itself."
"snapdggler","10","63","92","13 February 2000"," Norton takes throne as best Actor of his generation
","In just a short career, Edward Norton has emerged as the best actor of his generation. 5 films, 2 oscar nominations, and the best performance I have ever seen turned in by a modern actor. In this film, Norton plays a skin head who goes to Prison for brutally murdering two black men who are attempting to steal his car and comes out reformed only to find that his brother (Edward Furlong, turning in a fine performance) is headed right down that same route.<br/><br/>Yes, the ""hate is bad"" message is overplayed and by the end of the film you've been hit over the head with it. The scenes, as well as the story, are minimal and the ""shocking ending"" is predictable, but it all doesn't matter. It's all more of an actor's piece than any one else's and Edward Norton turns in the  most amazing performance I have ever seen captured on film. No longer, the sweet innocent psychopath he was in Primal Fear, Norton bulked up considerably for this role and it pays off.<br/><br/>It is, hands down, the most powerful American film in decades.

"DanielStephens1988","9","5","5","22 October 2019"," Beautiful film about how hatred will never resolve the problem
","The tragedy of evil is that in trying to stop it, you create it. So if you want to stop doing evil actions, you also have to stop seeing evil because to see evil you must project evil... therefore, you create evil. If you genuinely want to be moral, you got to make a counterintuitive move of giving up all morality. All of your moral rules give them all away. Only then you will truly be moral but if you go around touting your morality, and telling people how moral you are and how immoral they are, that immediately tells that you're not embodying your morality. A genuinely moral person would never do that because true morality is not based on rules, it's not a self-image that you adopt, it's not a list of 10 commandments that you follow. When you think you're so righteous and so moral, you will go and kill people in the name of your morality which is precisely what creates evil."

","If the feel-good movie is a genre, then this is the epitome of the feel-bad genre. I've seen plenty of movies that contain scenes that make me cringe because of their content, and many of them are great movies. But none of them, not even the brutal realism throughout Babel disturbed me as much in a good way as American History X. The curb stomp scene is possibly the most intense scene in any movie. After you see the violence in this movie, it definitely makes you look at some action movies in a different light.<br/><br/>I would not call this one of my favorite movies, but it is definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen. No matter how little you've been affected by other movies, you will feel at least a little sick after watching this. However, I implore you to see it no matter who you are despite the disturbing levels of violence. There's a reason it's number 32 on the top 250, and that's because it's possibly the most insightful movie ever made.<br/><br/>Going into this movie, I had always thought that white supremacists were just idiots that had no real reason for their extreme racism. But I had my view changed by this movie. Derek and Danny Vinyard, while not terribly educated are both smart characters and their racism is not blind. As a matter of fact, it is seductive, persuasive, and even understandable. It was scary how much reason I found in Derek's arguments, but the scenes in which we see why he believes what he believes are so engaging to watch. Unlike most movies that portray racial issues, this one is hardly one-sided. While the white supremacists are the antagonists, the black characters are hardly shown as saints. True they don't commit any heinous acts of violence on screen, but they are still shown as criminals in about equal measure to the white characters. The point of the movie is not to build up or tear down one race or another, it's just to show that all the racial hatred is a mentality that, while it may be seductive, cannot lead to anything good.<br/><br/>It's a very emotional movie, which does not mean that it's all sad. Yes, it's mostly depressing in tone, but there are a few lighter and incredibly hopeful moments to balance it out. Because of the violence and rage and bleakness of the rest of the movie, scenes like Derek connecting with Lamont, and Derek and Danny tearing down the posters and pictures in their room are highlighted and are more uplifting.<br/><br/>In terms of technical skill, it's done very well. Ed Norton's performance is amazing, and everyone else in the movie does pretty well too. Tony Kaye does a great job directing, making some unconventional but effective shots, like the extreme close-ups in the dinner scene between Derek and his father. Even the little decision for Danny to keep unconsciously rubbing his newly bald head was, I thought, a really good choice. I read that the movie was originally only 87 minutes and was extended by Ed Norton. Knowing this, I can see where some of the extensions may have been made, and while they aren't entirely necessary, they are included to good effect.<br/><br/>If you are an American over the age of about 16 or 17, I would strongly recommend that you watch this, and probably watch it alone. You might not want to watch it again, but it is a very important movie that has a timeless theme about what hatred can do to an individual and a community. It does not directly comment on any of the racial problems that we face in our current state of affairs, but it is still pertinent to today's race related issues. It is understandable if you don't want to watch this, but there is not a good excuse not to. Overall Rating: 8.7/10."
"gingerkris","9","128","203","28 September 2004"," Intelligent Drama
","Strong performances by Edward Norton & Edward Furlong really make this  film for me. The direction by Tony Kaye with his mixture of black &  white history contrasting with colourful reality is magic to absorb and  shows this film up to be what it is  a true American Classic,  ironically by a British director.  The film itself is about two brothers, Derek the elder and Danny the  younger adoring sibling. Derek has been in jail for three years after  killing a black youth who tried to rob the family; the nature &  brutality of the crime still shocks me to this day.   AHX tracks Derek's history through the first formation of racist  sentiment laid down by the father. These feeling of hate are  embedded when later his father is killed in the line of duty. Derek  becomes involved in the local Nazi movement, his intellect turned by  youthful rage into hate crimes and the rational that comes with Neo  Nazi propaganda.   The Nazi-tattoo sporting, egotistical, philosophical younger Derek is a  steam train waiting to crash, his propulsion to stardom is eventually  embodied when he takes the life of the young thief, the scene is very  apt as he calmly lies down and knows he will be a hero to his friends.  Without wanting to spoil the film Derek encounters change in the  prison, he meets a black man whom he works with and faces his own  demons inside, I will leave it there for those who want to be moved by  his transformation. Anyway, he comes out a new man and only wants to be  that new person, which means leaving the old crowd, leaving the  Anti-Jewish sepal he's been living with so long. The problem lies with  his brother who has become a little Derek, getting drunk and being  influenced like he was. Derek's cross to bear is that he can't change  his life without his brother coming with him and being on the right  side of humanity.  I think that this film is less about race and more about our ability to  change as individuals, the fact that we can become what and who we want  is a gift. Derek becomes the man he always wanted to be, he only wants  the same for his brother.   Kaye's use of black & white creates an atmospheric drama that builds  tension and has you feeling like a stung out piece of drum leather by  mid movie. I love the way that Kaye subtly uses quotes and  intellectualises the Nazi Stance, only to watch it being broken down by  the same man (Derek / Norton).  Norton is a joy to watch as is Gould and Furlong.   To sum up American History X is a powerful intelligent drama, which  provides plenty of discussion after the movie. This film should be on  every high school curriculum"
"MovieAddict2016","8","31","44","2 September 2005"," Not a perfect film, but very good - Norton's performance is the highlight
","""American History X"" is a bold and disturbing movie about family, racism and our own self-perceptions. Its main character is Derek (Edward Norton), a neo-Nazi skinhead who is released from jail to find his younger brother (Edward Furlong) descending down the same corrupt path as he once walked.<br/><br/>In jail Derek learns a few things about life, and racism, or more appropriately, himself, and after becoming a free man again takes it upon himself to set his brother on the straight and narrow path.<br/><br/>""American History X"" is not a pleasant motion picture. It begins in flashback, as Derek murders two black kids trying to break into his car. His brother, who idolizes Derek and later mimics his lifestyle, witnesses this event. It's a good message about negative influences, along with everything else.<br/><br/>Much has been made of the film's controversy and lawsuits. Director Tony Kaye disowned the film after Norton (allegedly) re-edited footage to give himself more screen time. Kaye tried to have his name changed on the film credits, but by this time he had already taken out a complaint in several magazines, which are against the rules of the Director's Guild. He was therefore denied the opportunity to credit the work as ""directed by Humpty Dumpty."" Then, musical band Anti-Hero complained to New Line Cinema (the film's international distributor) because one of the Nazi characters featured a tattoo of their band. They later wrote a song, called ""NLC,"" bashing the company.<br/><br/>Despite the hard-edged controversy it's still a very good film, above all else extremely well-acted and featuring a gripping storyline  even if the direction isn't always up to par.<br/><br/>Edward Norton is simply superb in his role, showing extremely raw talent a mere two years after his film debut (in the Richard Gere thriller ""A Primal Fear""). Norton careens between the role of a raging, vicious supremacist and a kindler, gentler version of the same character; a metamorphosis so convincing it's hard to believe it's just one actor.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is good as well  Furlong gives the best performance of his career and Beverly D'Angelo and Stacy Keach have strong supporting roles. (D'Angelo in particular, who portrays a sleazy alcoholic  a stretch compared to her usual Normal Mom roles in the ""Vacation"" movies.) ""American History X"" isn't exactly rewarding of all the praise it has been lavished since its release (mainly from viewers rather than critics, who were less kind)  it isn't the best movie of its kind or even a flawless one. The black-and-white photography isn't on the same level, visually, as ""Raging Bull"" or ""Schindler's List."" The preaching is a bit heavy-handed at times.<br/><br/>But it still manages to convey an important lesson and boasts great acting complimented by an (overall) impressive, gut-wrenching screenplay. A must-see for all who can stomach its content."

","Years have past since Danny saw his neo-nazi brother, kill several black males who were robbing his car.  Since he has been in prison, Derek's legacy has grown among the white gangs of the area and Danny has followed in his brother's footsteps.  When he writes a racist paper for school, his teacher makes his write a new paper, focusing on recent history  that of his brother and how he influenced him.  Meanwhile Derek leaves prison a reformed man with only the desire to repair the damage he once did to his family with his beliefs and his hate.<br/><br/>I was looking forward to see this film as I missed it at the cinema and am a firm believer that Edward Norton is one of the most talented actors of his generation and is always worth seeing (even if some of his films have given less than he deserves).  It was maybe better that I only saw it recently as I was able to enjoy it without all the hype and fighting over who did what to who, or all the comments from director Kaye as to his opinions of the film.  Having seen the pompous fool interviewed several times, I find it quite self assuring that I don't agree with his opinions of it!<br/><br/>The plot is a mix of flashback into Derek's hate filled past (told in b&w) and the present (colour) where he is desperate to save his brother and family from suffering anymore from his `sins'.  As a basic narrative the film struggles at times to make a solid story and seems to be trying too hard to create confrontations to up the drama within the film.  It still works mind you but this is not it's best asset.<br/><br/>The main thing the film does well is to be a very true representation of white male disillusionment.  The film avoids painting these people as monsters straightaway (although makes no bones that they are confused, misled and wrong).  The arguments and discussions they have in the film are not so far from reality that the characters seem fiction  the characters and the film's world seem very real.  The film's message that hate is no way to live no matter who it is directed at may be a little simplistic but it is a valid point.  One particular weakness which I felt was a little hamfisted was Derek's `road to Damascus' experience in prison  it was OK but was far too easy given the character we had just seen brutally kill several black men.<br/><br/>The other main selling point the film has is a performance by Norton that simply ensures he steals nearly every scene he is in.  In b&w flashback he is at his best  a larger than life character who is never allowed to just be seen as a thug.  Norton acts out the various stages of his life well and makeup ensures that he looks younger when required.  In the present he is less dominant but still is very good giving a different performance. Furlong is also very strong, although he only has a few scenes where he is able to be outside of Norton's shadow.  Support from Balk, Gould, D'Angelo and Brooks is mixed  Gould's Jewish character is only in the film to allow for one scene to occur, while Brooks' righteous teacher is simply a `morally upright teacher' with no meat on his character.<br/><br/>Overall this is a good film, which occasionally struggles when it forces the issue in the `present' scenes.  However for the most part it is a powerful film which owes a lot to well captured themes and an excellent performance from Norton."

","American History X is my all time favorite movie. Edward Norton was unbelievable in this! I first saw it when it came out many, many years ago. I actually watched it a few weeks ago. It's a classic. A must see. You have to understand that there are parts that will make you want to close your eyes. Just know, it is worth watching. Edward Norton is an incredible actor, actually they all are. It's a real movie, because sadly it is happening. Let's all put an end to Racism. I love everyone!

"ReelReal","Null","13","18","19 April 2007"," Tremendous performance ... dangerous ending
","This film has always bothered me as deeply as any I've seen, and I've seen thousands. I'm a film buff, and have been from the time I was a youngster watching old films with my mother. Many films have impacted my life, much the way they have a lot of people, and that's why it's important that filmmakers (real filmmakers) put deep thought into what they put on the big screen.<br/><br/>I saw AHX when it was first released. I saw it again a number of times since, mainly because I have tried to come to terms with the ending. Had it been a lesser film, I would have just labeled the ending thoughtless racism, as is in a lot of films, and moved on. But this film is so thoughtful in other ways that I have to believe that the filmmakers thought as deeply about the ending - often considered the most important part of a movie - of their film.<br/><br/>I've accepted that the white characters in the film were deep and layered characters, and the black characters, for the most part, were one dimensional stereotypes because the film is from the point of view of Edward Norton's character, and his family are the supporting characters. The black characters are secondary. That is until the end.<br/><br/>When the black kid shoots Daniel in the end, it makes him a much more important character to the story. And, we haven't seen enough of this character to understand his motivation. So, he just becomes some black kid who overreacted and killed a white main character who the audience loved and who was changing for the better. To me, that would go to make some in the white audience despise this kid, and be more sympathetic to Derek's point of view.<br/><br/>The filmmakers can't even argue that they were just giving a look at real life in this situation, as the scene does not at all fit what we know, or knew about violence among youth. (Excuse me for the upcoming generalizations, but race is the topic of the film, and I'm simplifying for time's sake.) We know we've had the school shootings by the outcast white kids, and we've had a number of inner city shootings by underprivileged black kids. The white kids have, in general, gone after the kids who made them feel like outcasts, and the inner city shootings have been part of gangs or the drug trade, where the intended victims are involved in the same. The issue of a black kid shooting a white kid because of some racist spat is just not reality.<br/><br/>So, we have a one dimensional black kid shooting a audience favorite character in an unrealistic scene. This is at the end of an otherwise well made film containing a thought provoking discussion dominated by a very intelligent and convincing skinhead character (played by the dynamic Edward Norton).<br/><br/>We've all heard that this film is praised by racists as well as ""non-racists"". So, I can't help but to wonder what the intentions of the filmmakers were.<br/><br/>Some might say that you can't dismiss the rest of this well made film because of the end. And I agree wholeheartedly. In fact, it's the poignancy and quality of the rest of the film that gives the ending such power. The ending of a film often brings together the themes and point of view of the film. So again, what were the intentions? I find the ending of this film to be out of place. Otherwise, this film is well made, well acted and so well respected across the board, and that may make it dangerous."

","The story is about the brothers Derek and Danny who are both smart and trying to questions things like in the society. When their father who's a firefighter goes into a black neighborhood trying to extinguish a fire he's shoot down by a drug dealer who happen to be a black person. Before this happened the father had told Derek about his racial opinions while they were eating one time. After the murder of his father Derek seeks to join a skinhead gang to avenge his father's death. one time later 3 black guys tries to jack his father's car from their front yard one night , Derek catches them and shoots one of them and brutally stomps on one the other guy's head killing him. Derek is convicted of manslaughter and will serve 3 years in prison.<br/><br/>After the 3 years in jail Derek is a changed man. He has grown back his hair and become a loving and caring person , tolerating different people. Because of all the horrible things that happened in the prison.<br/><br/>When he comes out he discovers that his little brother is going down the same path as him. And he desperately tries to save him.<br/><br/>Why I like this movie is because that its shows us that hate only leads to suffering and despair. After his father is murdered, it's like it is his duty to stand up against the blacks in society. He joins up with Cameron and starts a skinhead gang, telling people to join because of the black and Mexican gangs who bully people. He seeks identification, he joins a side.

"kylopod","7","71","128","13 March 2006"," Highly compelling, but not entirely convincing
","The concept of a reformed neo-Nazi is so intriguing that it's a wonder there haven't been more movies on this topic. Once you see ""American History X,"" however, you will understand why. The movie's racial themes are provocative and unsettling, far outside the comfort zone of the average viewer, and the movie additionally has the challenging task of explaining how a violent criminal changed his ways. Does the movie convincingly explain that transition? Not entirely.<br/><br/>It's an engrossing movie, nonetheless. It uses a device more common in literature than in the movies: inter-cutting between several story-lines. First we see Derek (Ed Norton) as a free man, newly released from prison, and having developed a conscience. Then we see earlier points in his life when he was a white supremacist, and finally the prison experience that changed him. The non-chronological approach is very effective, making the movie about as engaging as any thriller, even though the plot itself offers few surprises. Had the film followed a more conventional timeline, we'd have quickly grown impatient waiting for plot developments that were inevitable. With the way it's structured, our focus is on the process more than the outcome: How did a bright kid like Derek become a racist? And what turned him around?<br/><br/>The movie takes great pains to show how articulate the younger Derek is when he justifies his hatred of blacks by citing the statistics of black crime. (His more personal motive is that blacks murdered his father.) His arguments hit upon common politically conservative themes as he finds fault with affirmative action, glorification of criminals like Rodney King, and liberals who blame (white) society for the problems facing blacks. But Derek takes this reasoning a step further and argues that blacks have a ""racial commitment to crime."" Of course, by taking that step, he undermines his own arguments. For example, how does his harping about ""personal responsibility"" square with his belief in judging people for factors beyond their control, like their race? Responsibility requires choice. If race were the reason for black crime, then black criminals would be morally blameless. But no character points out such contradictions in Derek's views. When he debates a liberal teacher played by Elliot Gould, the gentle Gould character acts like a milquetoast, unable to provide a strong rebuttal. It's a powerful scene, and more than plausible: as in real life, people aren't always prepared with eloquent answers, even when confronted by someone with indefensible views.<br/><br/>Still, it's disconcerting that the film never fully addresses the ""intellectual"" side of his bigotry. The main impetus for Derek's change is internal: once he learns to respect himself, he starts respecting others--a nice thought, no doubt, but I'm not sure it would be a strong enough fulcrum for change in this character's racial views. Although some would assume that Derek is too intelligent to remain racist, I would assume he's too intelligent not to come up with yet more rationalizations.<br/><br/>There are other factors at work, too, including his treatment by white inmates and his befriending of a charming black inmate (Guy Torry). But all this seems to provide, at most, an emotional response to the earlier scenes. The movie made me realize how much the public attitude toward race has changed since the late 1960s, when optimistic films like ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" confronted racism by creating immensely likable African-American characters and ignoring any other social and cultural tensions that might pose a barrier to interracial relationships. In AHX, almost all the black characters are gang members and criminals, and there seems to be an underlying cynicism in the film's reluctance to provide a clear-cut refutation to Derek's right-wing arguments. Implicitly, the movie argues that there's a cycle of hatred going on between white and black gangs, and that the white racists aren't solely to blame for this situation. Aside from his relationship with Dr. Sweeney (Avery Brooks) and his prison friend, the basis for Derek's turnaround is largely negative: he realizes that he's no better than the black outlaws he so despises. That isn't exactly the most inspiring message about race relations.<br/><br/>My main reason for wanting to watch this movie in the first place was to understand better how an extremist hatemonger could change. But that turns out to be the least convincing aspect of the film. The root of the problem probably lies in the conception. The filmmakers started with the intelligent skinhead character, then they thought, ""What sorts of events will lead this character to transform?"" That's why the conclusion feels just a tad contrived. It's a good film, overall, but ironically where it's weak is in the very area that makes the story the most interesting."
"mohit_sinsniwal","10","3","3","26 May 2019"," This is a fantastic movie...
","American History X is a movie of its own. It has a little bit of everything in the way it touches you. This of course making it a very though provoking film. There isn't a genre you can place this film in because it is a not a crime story, action or even a simple drama instead it is a humanistic thriller. What it is about, is the battle over ourselves.<br/><br/>Who better than to display these wild but common complexities within people than Edward Norton. The range he shows here is astounding in only his fifth movie. Norton plays Derek Vinyard, a skin head that realizes through cruel yet necessary events in his life that he has gone down the wrong path. When he comes out of jail he attempts to stop his brother played Edward Furlong from going down the same road he had done. Through all his efforts though some things just prove to be inevitable. Avery Brooks also gives a great performance as Derek Vinyard's former teacher and now principal of his former school. His words may not be of the most inspiring but his actions and messages sent across are subtle yet strong and to the point.<br/><br/>Norton's performance though wasn't just about range but exploring different dimensions of life. Whether it proved to be psychological, social or even political on a certain level. It is a transforming performance revealing something mind blowing and eye opening. That we, and this includes anyone, can take a devastating turn in life no matter how intelligent we are or thoughtful. That the person that determines the outcome of your life is yourself whether it is good or bad. Norton's realizations aren't through teachings such as the ones that got him in jail but they are through the events in the time he spent in jail. He saw the truth for himself realizing then what is false and what is real.<br/><br/>The screenplay written by David McKenna is about as versatile as the performance Norton gives. Not only because of the Derek Vinyard character but because of the characters involved in his life. For example the root of his evil did not come from the murder of his father but rather his father himself. Through just a conversation at breakfast did his negative thoughts get really embedded eventually then leading to them dramatically taking over his mind and way of life. Only when his father got killed did these negative thoughts seem justified. The way this screenplay and direction was able to display this message in just a plethora of other underlying tones was spectacular.<br/><br/>What makes this movie great though is that you can truly find yourself in the messages delivered. As much as the main character might not seem relevant or connected to many people it his emotions and functioning of his mind that all of us are able to connect with. Yet what makes a movie great is not simply the message or messages sent across but how powerfully they are delivered. American History X delivers its multiple and intertwining messages about as powerfully as I've seen from a film."

","This snapshot of Venice, California, a racially tense seaside city, is both accurate and frightening. The irrational response of a repressed middle class white family to the indifference of an overly permissive government (since corrected since the election of President Trump) that allow American tax dollars to be spent on undocumented immigrants is highlighted in a speech within the film. Aside from the political aspect, the pure visceral energy of the film's violence and frustration from all races comes directly to the consciousness of the viewer. All forms of extremism are shown to be self-defeating. A bravura performance by both Ed Norton and Ed Furlong. An American classic."
"jordanand94","9","5","6","29 September 2018"," A film that continues to speak volumes to old and contemporary America
","This film is one that I would recommend to all, as it is just too important to ignore.<br/><br/>Racism, in all its disgusting and repulsive forms, is what built the United States, and it has unfortunately been ingrained into its fabric ever since, hovering over the country and continuing to derail its progress. Despite the progress the country has made in regards to annexing racism, it is still very much alive. This theme is very important to the film, as hate is passed down from generation to generation, in this case from the character of Derek Vinyard's father to Derek himself and ultimately to his brother, Danny.<br/><br/>The performance of Edward Norton and his transition from an angry and hateful human being to one of remorse and love for his family is impeccable. His character understands the pain he has inflicted on his family due to his beliefs of hate and tribalism, and that is a very positive message to movie goers; the more you become desensitized to what minorities go through in this country and the more you hate, the more your life will crumble. It is tragic to see the impact Derek has had on his family, more importantly his brother, which ends up being very detrimental at the end of the film.<br/><br/>One of the most moving scenes in the film is when Dr Sweeney visits Derek in prison, shortly after Derek has been raped by some of his fellow inmates. Derek is coming around now at this time about the errors of his ways, and Sweeney tells him, ""You have to ask yourself, Derek, has any of this, any of your actions and your racist beliefs, made your life better?"" Derek immediately responds ""No"" and begins to sob. Just a beautiful scene.<br/><br/>One issue I had with the film was how Danny, the younger brother of Derek, was so quick to realize the error of his ways, his thoughts. It just wasn't believable, from having been so upset with Derek one minute upon learning he didn't buy into racist propaganda to the next second tearing down the racist posters in his room. You would think it would take a whole lot more for him to change his thinking, based upon Derek's experiences in prison.<br/><br/>The slow motion scenes in this film are beautiful and the transition from black and white to color is also well crafted. The direction by Tony Kaye is exceptional.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this film is monumental in its importance and relevance to society today and holds a very imperative message - the more you hate, the more detrimental consequences it will have on your life. Life is too short to hate, just love. No need to be angry all the time, we are all the same. <br/><br/>9/10"

","American History X is a 1998 American crime drama film directed by Tony Kaye and written by David McKenna. It stars Edward Norton and Edward Furlong, and co-stars Fairuza Balk, Stacy Keach, Elliott Gould, Avery Brooks, Ethan Suplee and Beverly D'Angelo.<br/><br/>In a shocking opening scene, teen Danny Vinyard (Edward Furlong) races to tell his older brother, neo-Nazi Derek (Edward Norton), about the young blacks breaking into his car in front of the house, whereupon Derek gets his gun and with no forethought shoots the youths in their tracks. Tried and convicted, Derek is sent away for three years in prison, where he acquires a different outlook as he contrasts white-power prisoners with black Lamont (Guy Torry), his prison laundry co-worker and eventual pal. Meanwhile, Danny, with a shaved head and a rebellious attitude, seems destined to follow in his big brother's footsteps. After Danny writes a favorable review of Hitler's Mein Kampf, black high-school principal Sweeney (Avery Brooks) puts Danny in his private ""American History X"" course and assigns him to do a paper about his older brother, who was a former student of Sweeney's. This serves to introduce flashbacks, with the film backtracking to illustrate Danny's account of Derek's life prior to the night of the shooting. Monochrome sequences of Derek leading a Venice, California gang are inter cut with color footage of the mature Derek ending his past neo-Nazi associations and attempting to detour Danny away from the group led by white supremacist, Cameron (Stacy Keach), who once influenced Derek"
"tedg","Null","24","42","3 July 2002"," Clumsy Term Paper
","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>I found Ed Norton to be a plausible foil in `Fight Club,' but a simple mugger in `The Score.' I sought this out to discover whether he should be on a list to watch or not -- this being a picture he influenced heavily.<br/><br/>It is a mess. It is a mess because the director was too callow to have and impose a vision. So we get lots of different visions depending on the composition of the moment and the elements involved. One of those elements is Norton himself. I continue to maintain that the actor should never be in charge of the vision: he just has an entirely different set of concerns. One can see the scenes that Norton rips away from the director and sets up as billboards for himself.<br/><br/>There are times when this can work. Scorsese seems to have explored more than all of them. It doesn't work here. This material demands that it be centered in large numbers of `ordinary' people. The impact is that this could be widespread, not just isolated to one movieland character. But Norton sucks all the attention out of the story.<br/><br/>The material demands ambiguity. But the center is an unwaveringly decent black schoolteacher, as artificial a character as Norton's.<br/><br/>The material attempts some sort of reflection through the term paper/diary reflections of the brother. But this is clumsily written and ends up as simple narration, usually the sign of poor visual storytelling.<br/><br/>There is self-reference of sorts between Norton and his character. The character is playing a role that allows for one-dimensional excess. This role is widely respected because of the matter he preaches. So too with Norton himself."

","A Finnish commentator compared this film to American prison drama OZ . I love OZ , it`s my all time favourite American show , it`s compelling and brilliantly acted , adjectives you could use to describe AMERICAN HISTORY X. However while the HBO show suffers from lapses in logic there`s enough going on in different sub plots for you not to notice these flaws but seeing similar flaws in this film you can`t help but notice them<br/><br/>
First let me point out the good aspects . As said this movie contains great performances . In real life Ed Norton reminds me of the Kevin character from HARRY ENFIELD AND CHUMS with his floppy hairstyle and his back to front baseball cap but he always gives a good performance . In this movie he gives a GREAT performance as Derek the skin head from hell . Edward Furlong also gives a GREAT performance as Derek`s younger brother Danny . Norton earned an Oscar nod but strangely Furlong seemed to miss out , a pity . Tony Kaye also shows us he had great potential as a director , and it`s one helluva shame it`s unlikely we`ll be seeing either Furlong or Kaye as big Hollywood names<br/><br/>***** SPOILERS *****<br/><br/>But it`s the script that brings the film down , and in some places it`s quite woeful . Derek kills a couple of armed home boys who turn up at his house and he`s convicted of manslaughter . I know this is a plot device but couldn`t it have been better done ? Is it possible any jury would have convicted Derek for protecting his property from armed burglers . I guess all the jurors were called Goldberg and Rubinstein ? And I`ve got to agree with everyone who don`t buy the idea of Derek making friends with a black guy inside prison even after Derek gets raped by the skin head gang  , oh and how many prisons in America have a mix of one third black , one third hispanic and one third Nazi/peckerwood ?  It`s unrealistic the reasons why Derek stopped being a Nazi but it`s even more unrealistic why he became one in the first place - His Father used the "" N "" word a few times ! Of course the real reason might have been that his Father was murdered by a black gang but if that`s the case then why include the dinner scene ? It`s just confusing . There`s also another confused dinner scene where Derek`s mother invites a Jewish teacher around the family table . Would a Jew want to share a table with a couple of Nazi teenagers ?<br/><br/>But the major flaw is with the ending . AMERICAN HISTORY X is a very obvious redemption plot but Danny being murdered at the end doesn`t tie in with Derek`s redemption . If Derek remained a Nazi Danny would have died , if Derek had become a flower arranger with Greenpeace Danny would have died . No matter what Derek would have done Danny would still have been murdered . When writing a redemption plot it`s essential the ending of the movie ties in with the protagonist`s road to Damascus .<br/><br/>AMERICAN HISTORY X possibly does deserve to be in the IMDB top 250 movies but not at number 58 . It contains great performances but also some very poor scripting especially poor character motivation . If you want to see a better , more thought provoking film concerning race hate watch ROMPER STOMPER"

We see a close up of his Nazi Swastika (as if to hammer home the obvious point). This film tries to be poetic but doesn't succeed. After leaving the cinema, I had forgotten everything. This film doesn't even get close to a film such as The Haine, which had a much stronger build up of characters and story, and leaves a significant impact on the viewer, who can identify with the characters.

","****Spoilers*****<br/><br/>AHX begins and ends with violence committed by the African-Americans against the white people, mainly the neo-nazis of the film. IMO this creates a kind of frame for this film that got me thinking about another film with similar narrative and semantic problems. The D.W. Griffith film The Birth of Nation, aka. The Klansmen came to my mind and back when that film was made there really was racism around, and guess what, there still is. Everyone remembers the glorious battle scenes of Griffiths' film but how many remember the horribly racistic depiction of african american slaves portrayed in that film.<br/><br/>To me AHX suffers from the same symptom, trying to tell an epic story of some type but ultimately succumbing to racism because they simply hadn't done enough thinking about the subject matter that they had chosen. I really despise people who take everything that comes out of Hollywood as some kind of gospel that has to be studied and deified, IMO if it smacks of racism it's good to keep a distance to it. This film fails to say anything substancial about racism, it only succeeds in introducing the subject but it is as if the audience is being left waiting for a sequel, not because the original was so good but because the original failed to tell a good and complete story. And believe me, I have personally witnessed enough racism to know that one can easily make a really gripping and thoughtful film about racism, even without resorting to shock-tactics such as this film does.<br/><br/>
This film reminds me of that tv-series Oz that tries so very hard to be 'topical' and 'philosophical' and 'gritty and in-your-face realistic' but fails to do any of them. Both, Oz and this film, only succeed in being a kind of soap opera that caters to the sick minds of the ones with an appetite for violence. Violence does not a story make."

","***SPOILERS HEREIN***<br/><br/>American History X is a film filled with clichés and melodrama.  I am astounded that it is considered by IMDb users to be among the top 250 films ever made, let alone the top 100.<br/><br/>Edward Norton's performance was good, considering the material, and Edward Furlong is also a decent actor.  However, the other performances here were third rate and totally over the top.   Avery Brooks as Dr. Sweeney acted as though he were performing in a community theatre production of Shakespeare.  Totally unbelievable.<br/><br/>Speaking of unbelievability, how about, for starters, the incredibly lame scene wherein the movie's title is used as a line of dialogue?  So stilted and corny I almost turned the movie off right then and there.  (After seeing the end, I wish I had, but hindsight is always 20/20...)<br/><br/>Let's move on then, to the absolutely asinine basketball game.  What the hell was this, West Side Story?  I expected at any moment that they were going to start singing and dancing, doing the splits in an effort to get each other off their turf. I mean, come ONNNNN.  Then, when the white boys won, the black guys said, ""Oh, gee whiz!"" and turned around and left, never to return?  PLEASE!  I didn't buy it for a second, and I can't believe anyone else did.<br/><br/>On to my next grievance.  Norton's co-worker in the prison laundry was sent to prison for six years because he dropped a television on a cop's foot and it was considered assault.  He says he was caught because the store that he stole the TV from was right next to a donut shop filled with cops.  This movie supposedly tries to teach the viewer a lesson about how wrong it is to stereotype, but the whole thing is full of nothing BUT stereotypes.<br/><br/>Most annoying in my opinion, however, was the score.  The music constantly drowned out the dialogue (which, considering the writing, was probably a blessing). I abhor films that insult my intelligence by continuously attempting to manipulate my emotions with music.  If you want me to be moved by your film, cut out the sappy music, and give me good directing, good performances, and a believable story.  Don't try making me feel moved by music that's ten times louder than the dialogue because you can't make a decent film.<br/><br/>The ultimate insult in this film is the ending.  Absolutely beyond ridiculous.  Totally beyond moronic.  The kid that Edward Furlong blew cigarette smoke at is now going to shoot him in the face in the school bathroom?  Is he mentally retarded? Why not just shoot him in the middle of a police station, perhaps one full of white guys and black guys making angry faces at each other while fat cops sit around eating donuts?  At least a stealthy drive-by shooting would have been more realistic, if blowing smoke in someone's face is really an offense worthy of death.  Additionally, what was up with there being no paramedics in the bathroom when a child had just been shot? They are just going to leave him there with his head in the urinal??? PLEASE!!!!<br/><br/>Overall, this is an awful, awful, AWFUL movie.  Predictable, trite, with the most offensively contrived ending I have seen in quite some time.  I knew what was going to happen, and was appalled when it did.  Not because it shocked me or made me think, but because I couldn't believe the filmmakers thought I was really stupid enough to buy it.<br/><br/>What a piece of trash.  * out of *****.

"cadainoff","1","157","366","21 January 2005"," Just Horrible
","Possibly one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It reeks from start to finish, which is all the more painful because it was supposed to be good. Edward Norton sounds and looks more like the president of the Yale Republican Club than a white supremacist skinhead - the movies truly fatal flaw considering he's the linchpin of the whole thing. Elliot Gould as a woolly, ineffectual liberal is a stereotype, one of many in the cast.<br/><br/>More troubling than the acting, though, is the direction, which could charitably be called confused. How else to explain why we end up rooting for the skinheads to beat the black guys in a basketball game to determine who will stay off the public courts of Venice for good. How else to explain that the skinheads actually win? On the Venice courts, where the level of play is so high that Ron Shelton actually set his own movie there (""White Men Can't Jump"")? This scene is symbolic of how completely out of touch this movie is, how it ignores basic realities to construct its own while purporting to tell the truth, and how confused its storytelling and direction are. If racism is so bad, why are the majority of the black characters so unlikable, and why do the white supremacist characters seem so much more sympathetic and their actions so much more understandable? These concerns would be mere quibbles if the movie didn't claim to be so much more than it actually is. It fails to convey its message, and it fails artistically. Everything about it just sucks."

","American History X tries teach us all a lesson about racism.  However, what it really teaches us is no matter how much talent you have (Edward Norton and Tony Kaye), you can still make an awful and pretentious movie.

"Youngman_Grand","1","68","149","15 November 2010"," Weak, shambles, facile moralising.
","Making a movie about racism is a very easy way to tap into an audiences pre-existing righteous anger without the need to really explore the subject, treat it with respect or develop any kind of understanding around it. AHX knows this, so advances a paper thin plot with any number of ludicrous clichés, cardboard characters and dopy narrative devices. Edward Norton is no longer the Universes least convincing skinhead (stand up, Elijah Wood), but this movie stretches credibility way past breaking point.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't actually try to analyse racism on the more subtle, insidious way in which it exists in most peoples lives. Sure, there are neo-nazi and black power groups around, but this isn't most people's experience of racist behaviour. Only at the end of the movie do we get any hint this, when we see Dereks father discussing his pejudices over the dinner table. But this is very fleeting and it doesn't really give adequate justification for why Derek decided to go down this road in the first place. The movie should have spent far more time looking responsibly at the root causes of such peoples actions and ideologies - but that isn't as easy or as sensationalist as portraying all racists as maniacal cult-heads or separationists. The presence of characters like Stacy Keach's Manson-esquire demagogue serves the questionable purpose of allowing audience members to distance themselves entirely from these kinds of beleifs. Most people I think struggle to some degree with inherited prejudices as a result of ethnicity, class, geography, economic status etc, but films like this pander to our solipsistic view of ourselves as utterly non-judgemental by suggesting that racism only occurs amongst the lunatic fringe.<br/><br/>Additionally Tony Kaye more or less disowned the finished product, claiming that Edward Norton used his star clout to have the film re-edited so that it was more to his liking. The main point of contention seems to have been that Kaye felt the film should have had 'an adequate black voice'. I'm not quite sure what was exactly meant by 'adequate', but I can totally agree that the films narrow scope shifts sympathy onto the white protagonists in a confusing and dubious way. Because almost all of the black characters are so unlikeable, aggressive and one dimensional, with no context to explain their actions, and because one of them ends the film by murdering Furlongs character (a child) for pretty much no discernible reason, it's hard not to feel like we are expected to empathise with Derek and possibly feel like his original agenda was justified. AS well as this, when a 'liberal' character like Murray is portrayed as an ineffectual, idealistic fool, you begin to wonder why the film is so intent on making a violent, near-psychopathic skinhead into some kind of marginalised voice of reason.<br/><br/>Films that attempt to tackle the race issue in modern society will always fail to deliver as long as they are content to sit back and simply push buttons in order to generate a calculated response. The overwhelming majority of people in society know racism is a bad thing, but most ignore how endemic it is. Pinning it all on some gun totin' extremist hooligans, then not even being able to properly decide who you are sympathising with is not the mark of accomplished, mature filmmaking."
"sybolies","1","71","157","16 July 2000"," Worn out pseudo issue of racism, overdone again
","For it's appeal this movie relied entirely on dramatics based on pseudo racial tensions -- just like you see in almost all everyday boring media -- and the dramatics take on the same worn out theme of white supremacy aimed at the underprivileged black. Of course classism and other infinitely weightier issues are ignored in this type of black-and-white scenario. This issue is so overdone and so inaccurate that movies portraying it are at once passe and dangerously erroneous from a social standpoint.<br/><br/>If you like drama that rams its theme home by beating you over the head with theatrics, and if you are uneducated enough to believe that simple discrimination results from something as superficial as skin color, then you will probably like this movie and even think it's profound. If you appreciate the subtle beauty in life and understand how nearly all issues have depth beyond their specious veneer, this movie will just be another tired rendition added to the multitude of preceding ones that pivot from the same worn and ridiculous theme -- racism."

","Edward Norton is one of the greatest actors there is, and American History X is his greatest performance. His actions, as well as those of Edward Furlong, Avery Brooks and especially Guy Torry, are flawless.<br/><br/>It's the story of how a bright kid, Derek Vinyard (Norton), with wrong ideas gets in to a skinhead-gang because of a cunning leader who uses him for his own purposes, to establish nazism in America. Its frightening to see how much Dereks racistic opinions makes sense when hes arguing for them, I almost found myself agreeing with Derek(!), and its easy to understand how some people have gone so bad because of group mentality.<br/><br/>Then, when we watch Dereks life in prison, it feels like i'm being redempted myself. He befriends a black guy (Torry), learns how he got more years there for stealing a TV than Derek got for his double murder, and he is astounded. He (we) suddenly see through his clever arguing, and discover how stupid his ideas really is.<br/><br/>This is a hands down MIGHTY movie, and one of the best you will ever see. A solid 10/10"
"Manthorpe","7","12","21","6 February 2004"," Not all that it's cracked up to be...disappointing.
","Derrick Vinyard (Norton) is thrown in jail because he brutally murdered two black men one fateful evening when they tried to steal his car. He is a monster of a Nazi and is quite well known around the community as such. While in prison, Derek has had time to think and he realizes that his reasons for believing in what he does are complete and total frauds. His younger brother Danny (Furlong) seems to be heading down the same path. Can Derek convince his brother to change his ways before it's too late?<br/><br/>Ed Norton deserves all the credit he receives as a talented actor, and he definitely shows off his skills here. It's hard to believe that he's the same skinny weakling that he portrayed in Fight Club. He's a big muscle bound monster filled with hate for the first portion of the film and is then transformed into a man that has seen the light and faults in his ways. Top notch actor. Edward Furlong, despite being in only a few films, also shows off his acting abilities...however, neither one of them could save this film.<br/><br/>Minor Spoilers:<br/><br/>The premise of the movie itself would make it worthy of being in the Top 250, however it has serious flaws in execution and especially the script, as it's filled with entirely unbelievable situations. Too bad because I really wanted to like this one. Nazis playing basketball with local black gangs? Um, yeah m'kay? But a bigger flaw has to be Derek's reasons for having the beliefs he does and the reasons he changed them. His racist beliefs stem from his father's dislike for minorities and from his death in which he is killed by black people while trying to put out a fire in a crackhouse. The latter is believable but the look into his father's beliefs in the dinner scene was entirely unnecessary and laughable at best. Once in the slammer, he makes friends with a black inmate who enlightens Derek's view by telling him sex jokes. And although Derek has had the Nazi beliefs he has had for many years, a simple joke or two and getting rammed in the bootay by fellow Nazis in prison sway his opinion to the opposite. It could happen right?<br/><br/>The ending was what really put me off though and is the main reason why the movie showed itself, to me, to be pretentious. It would have made infinitely more sense had Derek been killed, but having Danny killed for simply blowing smoke in some black kids face is a serious flaw concocted by the makers, and is again, unbelievable. It makes me wonder what they actually thought when they first read the script. I guess they figured it would blow the audience away as there would be no way for them to foresee the final events. I believe that most people fell for this simple trick and is most of the reason why this film has such a lofty rating here at IMDB. Ideally, Danny's life should have been spared for Derek's redemption. Sure, it would've been a ""happy"" ending, but what we are left with is much worse. Groan.<br/><br/>This film left me very disappointed as I was looking forward to it's story and had heard many good things about it. However, the movie is simply not believable. A movie dealing with real issues needs to be, I don't know, more realistic.<br/><br/>Great acting, decent camera work, but terrible script.<br/><br/>
Generously, 7/10"
"lee_eisenberg","9","10","17","12 April 2006"," Why didn't anyone challenge Derek when he became a racist?
","My 9/10 rating is because ""American History X"" is very well done in every way, except that it seems that when Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) started spouting out the anti-Semitic diatribe, they should have asked him what became of his humanity. Then again, maybe they wouldn't know what to say in such a situation.<br/><br/>But other than that, the movie is quite good. Portraying a reformed Derek trying to prevent his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) from becoming a white supremacist, we get to see various issues. For example, when Derek is in jail and gets to know a black man for the first time, his anger starts to ebb. Good support from Beverly D'Angelo, Elliott Gould, Stacy Keach and Fairuza Balk make this a very good movie, even if they didn't develop it as far as they could."
"kristina-madsen","5","19","37","27 July 2007"," American Atrocity X
","I believe this film fails to do what it set out to. Intentions were doubtless noble but there are too many simplifications there for it to be convincing.<br/><br/>First of all, we see next to nothing of the brainwashing that the supposedly highly intelligent Derek must have gone through in order to become the person he is in the beginning. The filmmakers seem to think that a few scenes with Derek's father spewing benighted nonsense is enough to explain that. I would have thought that the propaganda would have to be fed to him in a more intelligent, subtle way for him to buy into it, but apparently he just takes his father's (inane) word as gospel while he learns nothing from his mother. And this even though whatever brains he has he definitely inherited from her - daddy is nothing but derisive about Derek's doing well at school. Now why would a smart boy be so one-sidedly influenced by the parent with whom he has the least in common? <br/><br/>Second, the same goes for his transformation the other way round. I understand that the film is ""based on a true story"" (not that *that* is usually a stamp of excellence), so the transformation did happen. But I do suspect that something has been left out. Don't get me wrong, it's fine for the film to be very loosely based on the story that inspired it, so long as the film makes its own sense. Sadly, it doesn't. So the other 'Arians' mistreat him (putting it politely), and he finds himself laughing at his black co-worker's joke? Well, Redemption City, here we come. From cold-blooded killer to fluffy do-gooder in two easy steps.<br/><br/>And I haven't even begun to talk about the real wrongness: The way the camera accentuates Derek's hot body. The larger-than-life slo-mo of his semi-nude form as he triumphantly turns in the police car's headlights (after stomping the black boy's head into the kerb - or curb, for the American reader). Why is Derek made to look sexy in this scene? Or the Riefenstahl-like - and insultingly unrealistic - basketball scene? Is there a point or was it just that Norton wanted to look good? He succeeded there, but at the expense of what I thought the film was supposed to convey.<br/><br/>All in all, the film's message drowns in cliché in form and content both, oversimplification, an embarrassingly tear-jerking score, and Norton's ill-concealed enjoyment of his own sexiness. That, to me, is just plain wrong. I usually like Norton's performances but not this one. No wonder director Tony Kaye washed his hands of it. Rumour has it that Norton took over much of the director's job. That was clearly a mistake. A shame, considering that racism in the US (or anywhere) is an issue that needs to be dealt with properly."
"AvnerLipschitzDDS","1","29","63","4 June 2015"," Cultural Agitprop X
","As a Jew, I must say this production is seemingly straight out of the Frankfurt School of thought and should be revealed as the subversive Jewish Agitprop X that it is. <br/><br/>Sadly, this film has shortcomings that range from the acting, to the direction, and even the post editing. But most importantly, the film utterly fails in its attempt to escape the infantile, pedestrian stereotypes that mire the picture in a laughably obvious attempt to drive an anti-white political narrative, not make an entertaining movie with any integrity whatsoever. <br/><br/>This film goes out of its way to make the ""groundbreaking"" assertion that neo Nazis are misguided. Thanks, Hollywood Jews; I was wondering about that! But it makes no attempt to honestly investigate the legitimate (yes, legitimate) reasons behind white pride movements in general and uses epithetic, out-of-place ""dialogue"" to tacitly delegitimize a father's attempts to explain to his son what is justifiably wrong with liberal fascists trying to issue reparations for past injustices. <br/><br/>The more prominent motifs in this film are clearly disturbing: 1. Blacks have no autonomy or agency and thusly cannot be held accountable for their overtly disproportional criminality. ""They are merely products of social injustice and poverty."" Real racism in action, my goy friends. 2. Black racism against whites should be accepted while only white racism, which we are led to believe is rampant ""just under the surface"", should be detested. 3. Whites should feel guilty for transgressions they did not personally commit because after all...white privilege, institutional racism, microaggressions, and other incredibly nebulous ""sociological contrivances."" 4. While all non-Caucasian groups that celebrate a racial identity are to be exalted, any pride among people of European descent is to be viewed with moral pessimism, abhorrent disgust and outright social rejection without the benefit of a civil discussion. <br/><br/>I'm not technically ""white""; but I can appreciate the innumerable gifts Caucasians have given the world. It's too bad so many of my fellow Jews in the movie industry take every opportunity to slander the descendants (especially males) of a group who produced a country that provides blacks the most hospitable environment to make something of themselves...or be their own worst enemy. That's freedom and I love the right not only to succeed, but also to fail. Failures make us who we are- for better or worse. This film hopefully makes someone better as it failed both technically and morally."

","What a fantastic raw film that focusses on showing not only the brutal acts that hate groups commit, but also showing the human elements that contributes to the corruption of adolescence. Everything about this movie is incredible from the themes that it tackles to the stylistic choices made by the filmmakers. One in particular is Tony Kaye's choice to use black and white footage to represent the changing of opinions had by Derek Vinyard(Edward Norton), physically showing how black and white everything began. Along with these awesome choices all the actors performances were on point in this film, Edward Norton is at his best giving the audience a look into his characters personal psyche. Another incredible part of this movie that I think is worth mentioning is the use of violence. I think the reality of violence in films is almost glamorized in a lot of films taking away the horror of simple acts, but not in this film. The first sequence of this film is of a brutal depiction of violence which physically makes the audience sick, and with every viewing you find yourself more and more upset with Darek Vinyard.<br/><br/>But before I rate this film I would like to say that I was not a fan of the aspect ratio they chose to use, I know that this might not be the largest detail but I still wanted to bring it up.

The main theme is racism, but I didn't feel this movie explored it in a completely satisfying way, or at least in a way I haven't seen before. The story was pretty simple: the guy is a delinquent (Neo-Nazi), we see his life, he goes to prison, gets some kind of a realization after bonding with a black man, decides that his past lifestyle was wrong and becomes a better man after he's released from prison.<br/><br/>At some points of the movie, I felt that the actions by some characters weren't appropriate or literally came out of nowhere with no build up like Derek murdering people in the middle of the street. And the moment at which film didn't do well was the most important one - the scene in which Derek realizes the consequences of his actions, how bad of a person he was and how little he devoted himself to his family. It just left me unsatisfied. It wasn't captured very well. The events that were supposed to lead him to this point lacked a bit in the execution department. The script left much to be desired here.<br/><br/>With that said, this is not a bad movie. There are some great performances here. Norton and Furlong did a particularly great job. Danny's tragic fate also offers something to think about. However, the shortcomings of script and execution prevent it from being truly great.

All in all the story holds up quite well until Derek comes home from jail.<br/><br/>There it is: our turning point: the movie quickly becomes painfully predictable: thanks to a rape in the showers, to a clichéd ""friendly African-American inmate unjustly convicted"" and to his old professor's (African-American himself too...) Derek suddenly sees the light and turns his back to his old friends and ideals.<br/><br/>Of course Derek's redemption has a huge influence on his younger brother Danny, but sadly his fate is written already...<br/><br/>Essentially American History X is a movie of two halves: the first part is enjoyable and outstanding, despite some predictable twists. The second part is preachy and even more predictable, so the redemption-through-death ending doesn't come as a surprise, but more like as a consequence.<br/><br/>To be honest, the whole movie is filled with clichés and stereotypes: Derek's dad is the typical narrow-minded WASP, the White Power guys are complete morons with zero depth (which might be realistic, but come on... show some imagination). The positive characters are African-American, and of course we can't go without the token Jewish character and the liberal one getting unfairly abused.<br/><br/>Even disregarding that aspect, Derek seems to joins and leaves the White Power crusade too abruptly and with little-to-none inner labour.<br/><br/>THAT, much more than the cheesy and predictable twists, is the most disappointing aspect of a movie which could and should have been more complex.<br/><br/>But, as said, the movie industry is manichean: things are either good or bad, black or white. Layers of grey aren't welcome."

","""American History X"" is not a weak, fluffy, cutely wrapped after school special on racism, life in the 'hood, life in prison, and breaking the cycle. ""American History X"" is powerful and hits like an anvil. Edward Norton does an excellent job as Derek Vinyard, a venomous, hateful leader of a local gang of skinheads.<br/><br/>The movie takes a singular look at a young man who is entrenched in the White Supremist movement, then how he emerged from that life, and even how he started down that path to begin with. Of course most people don't like racist bigots and the movie shows the very ugly nature of the skinheads/Arian Brotherhood. But the movie also shows the interaction between the Whites and Blacks in the 'hoods of L.A. There was by no means an angelic depiction of the African-Americans in this film. A few of the blacks shown were thugs who in part helped shape the views that Derek and his brother Danny (Edward Furlong) held as White Supremists, but there were also a couple of key African-American characters that helped to reshape the views of Derek and Danny.<br/><br/>""American History X"" made sure to do it right and make it true to life. The life Derek had before prison, the life inside of prison with the segregation and the gangs, and his life after prison as a changed man. This was no ""Mississippi Burning"" or ""Rosewood"" detailing events of the past, rather this was a movie showing the present, the good and bad in both parties, and the different ways people can be reformed."

"greenhalgho","10","3","4","16 March 2018"," A Powerful, Eye Opening Story About Change
","When I first came across the movie American History X it was while I was looking through Edward Nortons films on his profile. Having seen Primal Fear and Fight Club just a few weeks prior to this I was intrigued to see what other roles he could take on. Furthermore, I was a huge fan of Edward Furlong in Terminator 2 and was happily surprised to see him on this cast list as between 1991 and 1998 when this was released, he did not have many major roles.<br/><br/>The story is told through switching from present to past and the way it is done is simply outstanding. The flashback scenes are in black and white to firstly make it clear when the time period is and arguably also to show the darkness that was consuming Edward Nortons character when following the neo-nazi way of life that he did for so long. Edward Norton himself also adds to this effect and his performance makes it seem like he is playing two separate characters. His brother in the movie 'Danny' is played by Edward Furlong who gives a very gripping performance as we see his character change his ways completely in front of our eyes. The time period of only one day also adds the severity of this change and in a very powerful way shows the effect of influence that one person can have on another.<br/><br/>For people that haven't seen this movie it is without a doubt one of the most powerful movies I have personally seen and one that I believe everyone should watch. Because of this, I have not given away many details of the movie and I believe that words cannot convey the true message that this 'masterpiece' conveys.<br/><br/>10/10. Cinematic Brilliance"
"charbelelaro","10","3","4","5 September 2017"," ""American History X"" is the true purpose of film
","Let me begin by saying, this was not an easy film to watch. It was highly confronting surrounding aspects of racism in American society, as well as the unspeakable reality of prison. Although this is exactly what made this film great. I have not seen a film be this courageous in tackling issues that occur in society. Issues that people would rather be oblivious to, are completely exposed in this film. A large number of people steer away from films like this, and prefer to watch meaningless, poorly made films, as its an easy watch. And to a certain extent, light hearted movies are perfectly enjoyable. But ""American History X"" is the true purpose of film. As to why it is, can be described through various elements which make up and form this masterpiece.<br/><br/>The first element is the cast. 'Edward Norton', as Derek was incredible, to say the least. His character possessed so much depth, which was slowly revealed to the audience as the film went on. He progressed and behaved so realistically, I no longer saw an actor playing a character. Furthermore, the casting of his entire family was perfect, in particular his younger brother Daniel played by 'Edward Furlong'. He portrayed a troubled teenage kid in the most realistic way. At times I was trying to pick flaws with aspects of his character that weren't as refined or polished, only to realise that these imperfections are true characteristics of any average kid. The history teacher, Dr. Bob Sweeney, played by 'Avery Brooks, also did a spectacular job, in trying to solve the complicated situation. <br/><br/>The second element is the screenplay. This is how a screenplay should be written. Take a simple story-line, and execute it in the most complex way possible. This screenplay takes you on a journey, by firstly showing the situation at hand as a uninformed outsider, but then slowly gives you context and background as the film progresses. This was done so coherently with brilliant flashbacks, which by the end of the film, made you look at each character in an entirely new light. This was what made the film so engaging. The fact that I was curious to see what events shaped these characters, made the flashbacks feel very much anticipated. Also the dialogue between characters was sharp and gripping, especially in scenes where opposing ideas and opinions were battling against each other. It really built the intensity and tension in the film. <br/><br/>The final element is the cinematography. The camera movement, and editing was exceptional. The way in which flashbacks were presented in black and white, gave past events much more power and intensity. I particularly liked the way in which there was a constant focus on water. The slow motion shots of dripping water in the shower, made you really feel the exhaustion and fatigue felt by the characters.<br/><br/>Overall, the general reason as to why 'American History X' is the purpose of film, is due to the fact that it exposes its audience to confronting aspects of our world. It is able to inform people who may live sheltered lives, much like myself, about the racism and violence, which is a constant reality for many till this day. This film provides its audience with a wider view of the world, contributing to our worldly knowledge and awareness. This is all achieved due to the perfect execution of the elements in the film, discussed above, which all assist in making this film a true masterpiece."

","The one reason to watch this movie is for the acting - it is intense - esp. concerning the lead character.<br/><br/>The lead character is immediately interesting because he has a good mind - he is bright, clever, consistent and intense. He is impressionable yet searching for his own answers.<br/><br/>From this character, we see how it is possible to uncover deep understandings - not about others, but about one's own self. Watching the lead character go through this process is what makes this movie so interesting.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie doesn't quite match the interest level of the lead character, but it is still good. Because it involves racial tensions and Nazi references, it's easy to get drawn into the story quickly. Overall, I recommend watching the movie."

"JamesHitchcock","8","4","6","13 April 2006"," Biography of a Repentant Nazi
","""American History X"" is the biography of a repentant Nazi. Derek Vinyard is a young man from a poor white family in Los Angeles. After his father, a fireman, is shot dead while tacking a blaze in a black area of the city, Derek becomes a bigoted racist, joining a violent Neo-Nazi skinhead group and getting involved in clashes with local black and Hispanic gangs. When a group of black youths attempt to steal his truck, Derek fights back, shooting one of them dead and killing another by stamping on his head. For this crime Derek is arrested, convicted of murder and jailed for three years. When he comes out of jail he is a hero to his former skinhead comrades, but he is a changed man who wants to disown his past and to renounce hatred and violence. His greatest fear is that his younger brother Danny, who idolises him, shows every sign of following him down the Neo-Nazi path.<br/><br/>The present-day scenes, dealing with Derek's attempts to lead Danny away from his fascination with Nazism, are shot in colour. Derek's own history is told in flashbacks, shot in black and white. We see him as a frustrated, angry young man, intelligent and articulate, who becomes a monster wholly lacking in conscience. We then see how he is changed by his experiences in prison, and how he comes to realise two things. The first is that blacks are people too, with as much right to exist as he has. The second is that his sterile ideology of hatred has actually blighted his own life, offering nothing better than a jail sentence and the prospect of martyrdom in a worthless cause.<br/><br/>I was interested to note that the film's director Tony Kaye and its star Edward Norton later quarrelled about the editing of the film, because it was their contributions which helped lift the film above the ordinary. This could have been just another worthy ""issue of the month"" anti-racist film, but Kaye's direction and Norton's acting mean that it is much more than that. The black and white sequences, particularly the murder and the prison scenes, have a stark, violent power. I have been impressed by Norton in the past in films such as ""Primal Fear"", ""Fight Club"" and ""Kingdom of Heaven"", but this was probably the best of his performances that I have seen. In the scenes where Derek is part of the skinhead gang there is a frightening intensity to his violent hatred, and his transformation during the prison scenes is agonising as he realises that the whole of his life has been based on a lie. Norton receives good support from some of the other actors, such as Edward Furlong as his younger brother and Avery Brooks as their black history teacher Dr Sweeney.<br/><br/>I was interested by the comments of another reviewer who pointed out that the first anti-racist films in the sixties tended to give idealised portraits of black characters. The example he gave was ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"", but there are other examples such as ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" or ""In the Heat of the Night"". The assumption was that the roots of racism lay in irrational prejudices among the white community which could be overcome by the simple exercise of greater goodwill. There is no such easy assumption in ""American History X"", and no assumption that the problems of racial tension can be overcome by the standard liberal remedies.<br/><br/>By far the most eloquent voice we hear in the film is Derek's; the token voice of liberalism is the ineffectual one of Murray, the new boyfriend of Derek's mother, played by Elliott Gould in one of the film's weaker performances. Although some of their doctrines are just simply wrong (such as the idea that blacks have a genetic predisposition towards crime) there is a suggestion that the success of the extremists in winning support is partly due to legitimate grievances among working-class whites over immigration and affirmative action. Derek's reformation is due to self-interest rather than to any conversion to a liberal world view; he realises that following an ideology of violence and hatred has done nothing to improve his lot or that of whites in general.<br/><br/>Although Derek is befriended by a sympathetic black inmate while in prison, the black characters in this film are far from idealised. The malevolence of the white skinheads has its equivalent in the violent criminality of the black and Hispanic gangs. There is, in fact, a suggestion that these gangs hate one another and yet are also dependent on one another. The Neo-Nazis rely on white fears of black crime in order to recruit members, increasing black fears about white racist violence, thus enabling black gangsters to consolidate their own power by exploiting the idea of racial solidarity. It is notable that in prison the white racist gang-leaders are quite happy to discuss matters of mutual concern with their black counterparts, while subjecting Derek to a brutal rape for the ""crime"" of becoming too friendly with a black prisoner.<br/><br/>The implication is that the responsibility for racism does not lie solely with the white race, or with the black race, or with any other race. Perhaps the fault lies with the concept of ""race"" itself, the idea that humanity can be divided into discrete sub-groups on the basis of physical appearance and that the most important thing about any individual is his or her skin colour. The film does not offer any easy solutions to the social problems it deals with, a pessimism highlighted by its tragic ending. It is, however, an important film, thought-provoking as well as emotionally powerful. 8/10"
"Navaros","1","27","66","19 February 2008"," Very contrived, badly-acted and unrealistic soapbox movie to let us know ""Racism is bad!""
","American History X is a very contrived and unrealistic soapbox movie against racism. The purpose of the movie is simple: beat viewers over the head with a simplistic message that they all already agree with in the first place! Namely, ""Racism is bad!"" Everyone already knows racism is bad, so a movie comprised of 2 hours worth of strung-together ridiculous contrivances that exists solely for the purpose to push the message ""Racism is bad"" is not exactly a work of art. Nor is it food for thought. This movie won't tell anyone anything that they don't *already know*, therefore the existence of the movie is pointless.<br/><br/>Edward Norton plays a hardcore Nazi skinhead. He *looks* the part, but as soon as he opens his mouth, any chance of him being believable in that role is utterly destroyed. Edward Norton talks like - and has the demeanour of - a computer geek. There is no way to reasonably be immersed in believing he is a hardcore Nazi skinhead. For this reason I'm going to have to say Edward Norton gives a terrible performance in this movie. *Good* actors can change their voice, demeanour, and the aura they give off. Edward Norton cannot. He uses the exact same voice, and has the exact same wimpy computer geek demeanour/aura in American History X as he does in every single movie role he ever does. It bewilders me why such a bad actor - with no range whatsoever - is so popular. It actually makes this movie be *unintentionally hilarious* to see such a buffed guy be so incredibly wimpy and non-threatening.<br/><br/>Edward Furlong plays his little brother. Furlong gives a good performance as always, however, he isn't given anything to work with. All his lines are very generic and bland.<br/><br/>Avery Brooks gives an okay performance as the school principal, but there is nothing special about it. He's exactly the same in this movie as he is as Sisko in Deep Space Nine, or the gangster in the movie The Big Hit. Actually it seems Avery Brooks has actually *dialed down* his intensity in American History X; an intensity he has in all those other roles but *not* in American History X. So I must conclude that Brooks' performance in American History X is worse than usual.<br/><br/>Edward Norton is supposed to be playing an extremely smart individual, yet his actions in this movie are anything but. He foolishly sets up a chain of events where if he had any intelligence at all, he would have foreseen that that chain of events would be sure to lead to his rape in prison. He also would easily have avoided prison in the first place if he had any intelligence. He also would have been able to prevent the bad ending his brother receives if he had any intelligence. Yet he sticks around the neighborhood like a moron at the end of the movie, which is what allows for his brother to be murdered.<br/><br/>The ending of the movie is ridiculous, and actually ends up *reinforcing* the (incorrect) idea that Norton's character's original beliefs in this movie are accurate. The movie exists to say ""Racism is bad!"" in big flashing NEON letters. However, the ending of this movie (perhaps inadvertently) completely destroys this message by implying that Norton's character was right to be a Nazi skinhead. The ending of the movie has a Black guy murdering Furlong's character for no reason. Furlong blew smoke in his face earlier in the movie, but that is not a reason to shoot someone dead over (maybe a beat down at the very most). It is not something someone would do in real life. Yet this movie (perhaps racistly) has a Black kid killing a White kid for no reason whatsoever, which lends (tragically!) undeserved credibility to idea that the Nazi beliefs are correct and Norton's character was wrong to abandon them. This movie can't even get it's own very basic message right.<br/><br/>0/10."

","A white supremacist Derek (Edward Norton) is sent to jail for brutally killing two black men who try to steal his car.  Through some harrowing experiences in jail he realizes his way of thinking and living was wrong. He gets out and tries to prevent his young brother Danny (Edward Furlong) from becoming the same as him...but is it too late?<br/><br/>First off I'm giving the film an 8.  I thought is was excellent but it does have problems--it's overlong (I was bored more than once); there's way too many slow-motion sequences; there's disjointed editing; a finale I saw coming from a mile away and an annoying tendency to cut from b&w to color constantly.  Those issues aside the film is great.<br/><br/>The script and imagery is strong and graphic (as it should be) and there's some great acting here.  Norton is just superb (he was Oscar-nominated); Furlong is subdued but good as Danny--a lot of his emotions come through in his eyes; Beverly D'Angelo was just great as their mother and Fairuza Balk is frightening as Norton's girlfriend.  The only bad acting was by Avery Brooks--but he's not really a main character so it doesn't really hurt the film.<br/><br/>Some of the sequences in here were very difficult to watch (the attack on the store, the prison sequences and the finale) but they're meant to be that way.  This movie hits you over the head with its message but it does work. It just didn't affect me that strongly.  As I said, I saw the ending coming from a mile away so it didn't shock me at all.  Still, it is a powerful film.  Well worth catching.<br/><br/>Also there was a huge amount of controversy when this was released.  It seems the director (Tony Kaye) accused New Line Studios of letting Edward Norton into the editing room and cut the film himself (this is no shock--Norton is known as a control freak).  He requested his name be removed from the credits and replaced with Mickey Mouse or Donald Duck.  He didn't win his request.  If Norton did indeed edit this film--he shouldn't quit his acting job.  The editing here is herky-jerky and the film could easily lose those slomo sequences."

","This film had been highly recommended to me as a 'must-see' by a friend of mine as it was apparently so thought-provoking and powerful.<br/><br/>The only thing that this film provoked in me was anger and disappointment - not with the subject matter, but with the film makers, and this type of film in general.<br/><br/>If this film had been put before us in a realistic and more balanced, politically-unbiased way, then it would have perhaps got its message across much more effectively.<br/><br/>In terms of realism - virtually every character in the film is a ridiculous stereotype. The funniest example of non-realism has to be the black v white basketball match could not have been depicted any less realistically if they had tried.<br/><br/>The scene: A group of skinheads (who as far as we know have never played the game before) challenge the blacks (who seem to spend the majority of their lives playing the game) to a gentlemanly basketball challenge, whereby whoever loses has to immediately vacate the premises and never come back. Of course the skinheads narrowly win, and the losers politely vacate the area without so much as an ""M.F."" being uttered.<br/><br/>Yeah right...<br/><br/>The overall impression I got from this film was that it was just another crude anti-white, anti-democratic, socialist rant-fest along the lines of other similar films (Romper Stomper etc), and the message it puts across is this: <br/><br/>If you are a white man who prefers the company of his own kind and dislikes black people, then you are a brainwashed, monumentally unintelligent loser who is incapable of reasoning or making any judgements for yourself. You idolise an insane 1930's Austrian dictator and there is a high probability that you are a homosexual rapist.<br/><br/>If you are a black man who prefers the company of his own kind and dislikes white people, then that is totally acceptable and cool. If you want to be obnoxious and confrontational to the white folks, and go around shooting them through the head for no good reason, that is understandable because they are all probably horrid racists and deserve it.<br/><br/>This film should be burned along with the small-minded chumps that made it."

","According to the IMDb list of the top 250 films of all time, THIS comes in at a staggering #44. If we are to go by this incoherent list, we are to believe that ""American History X"" is a better film than Kubrik's ""Clockwork Orange."" It is superior to the ""Deer Hunter,"" and the classic ""Third Man."" It even outshines Germany's epic masterpiece ""Der Untergang/Downfall."" After you are finished laughing, consider the film ""American History X,"" a hack job so embarrassing that it's director, Tony Kaye wisely attempted to have his name removed from the final product. Why would a director want to deny responsibility for a film that is considered by countless idiots who consider this better than ""Metropolis??"" Because 'A.H.X' is a mediocre film at best. From it's infantile, laughable, simplistic, and thoroughly inaccurate views on racism, to it's soap opera like melodrama, down to it's gross, comical overblown stereotypes, such as the ex-gang member 'uncle tom' preachings of Avery Brooks, as the black school principal, to the ultra stereotyped Jewish ideal, played by none other than Elliott Gould! Why weren't more people offended by this obnoxious representation of minorities? And of course, the skinheads were portrayed as ugly, stupid, and faceless monsters, with the exception of Hollywood movie star Ed Norton, who is a fine actor, but who was just too pretty to be believable here. A word of advice to future filmmakers: If you want to make a powerful statement about serious political issues, avoid using the latest Hollywood pin-up hunk to get the point across, as it just does not work. Remember Alan Pakula's ""Devil's Own"" with Brad Pitt as the hunky IRA hero/terrorist? Enough said. Ed Norton plays Derek, a young man who turns into a hate preaching neo nazi skinhead after his fireman dad is shot while putting out a fire in the ghetto project. Norton does not look like he ever stepped foot inside a housing project, but that does not stop him from becoming the spokesperson/leader to a generation of mean, angry skinheads, all of which tower above Norton. And as good an actor as Norton is, I did not believe him in the role of a lower middle class skinhead; He sounded more like a sheltered private school boy trying to act tough. It seems that the filmmakers have never even met a real skinhead, as this portrayal was so unbelievably inaccurate. AHX makes the mistake that so many Hollywood films make; It attempts to manipulate our emotions with sad, wistful, dramatic music. This method was grossly overused here, and some of the dialog could barely be made out over the overpowering ""backround"" music. More evidence of this films failings; if the script, and performances are good, we will feel the emotions on our own. Intelligent moviegoers do not need our emotions to be ""cued"" by the appropriate music. This is a sure sign of a poor film. Derek's transformation from normal boy, to racist skinhead, to finally a strong, enlightened protector of his family and responsible brother/son, after an ""Oz"" like stint in jail, would work fine, for a film made for television. But the fact that this thoroughly underwhelming movie scored so high on this website is proof enough that these ratings cannot be taken seriously. It saddens me that so many people cannot see the difference between truly good cinema, and mediocrity. It is more tragic that so many people can be this easily manipulated by this kind of Hollywood dreck. Having had the opportunity to view hundreds of films from around the world, I am not impressed by Hollywood's repeated attempts at making serious, intelligent films that deal with issues such as racism and poverty. Hollywood needs to stick with the flashy entertainment, the explosions, the comedies, the Sci-fi, as for this type of film-making, Hollywood can't be beat. And for those who want to see a truly good film dealing with the same subject matter as A.H.X, take a look at ""Mississippi Burning"". Here is a rare example of when Hollywood got it right; a well made, beautifully realized piece of cinema, that deals with the racism issue without being corny or ridiculous. As far as ""American History X"" goes, do not believe the hype."

","There is only one reason for the high user ratings this movie receives. Because of its subject matter, people like it because they think they SHOULD.  To dislike it might cause one to be perceived as being insensitive to racial issues, but anyone looking at this film with a critical eye will find that its shortcomings make it practically laughable.  The basketball scene itself is so silly, it single-handedly destroys any credibility this film might have had.  Others have already noted the unbelievable dinner and prison scenes as well.  A lifetime of hate - instant contrition.  How can anyone possibly take this thing seriously?  There are far greater movies on racial injustice, ""Mississippi Burning"" being one that comes to mind quickly.  AHX should be closer to the bottom 250 than it is to the top."

","Unconvincing portrayal of a struggling family whose two boys are racist skinheads.  One of the sons, after a stint in jail, has a change of heart and decides to save his little brother from the mindless hatred that nearly ruined his life.<br/><br/>This film tries so hard to be a gritty, dark, morality tale of modern western life that it ends up parodying itself unintentionally.  I'm afraid a few angst ridden actors smoking and shouting out a lot of swear words does not a great movie make.<br/><br/>The movie also has two of the stupidest moments on film.  Why the brothers, one of whom has just escaped death at the hands of his former gang, decide to sit and have a nice chat about life rather than run to the nearest phonebox and warn mom and sis (who are sitting passively at home like women do) is unrealistic.  Perhaps it didn't cross the boys minds.   Dumber still is why any self-respecting, skinhead gang did NOT immediately go to the boy's home and kill and destroy is beyond comprehension.

","I disagree very strongly with most of the people on this board. It seems strange that I despise this movie with such venom while other people hold it up as a perfect piece of work. Maybe my standards are higher. Maybe I've seen so many movies that I can see cliches more clearly than most. Maybe I expected more from a film with an ambition to change the world. Maybe I'm feeling disappointment because it failed so completely.<br/><br/>I think ""American History X"" is a complete waste of your time. This is the story of a neo-Nazi named Derek who repents and gets out of prison just in time to save his kid brother Danny, who is going down the same skinhead path. That's the whole story. Everything else is atmosphere and complication, with sermons at every turn. I can understand why the director wanted to remove his name from the picture.<br/><br/>Likewise, I can understand why Edward Norton was nominated for an Oscar for his portrayal of Derek, the jailbird brother. Norton is one of our best actors and squeezes lots of blood from this stone of a production. His speech rhythms and body language are wonderful. However, I can't find anything else to recommend apart from Norton's performance. The script is preachy, predictable, simplistic and badly staged. Edward Furlong is useless as Danny the baby skinhead, and the annoying fat guy who blabbers Nazi platitudes is one of the worst actors I have ever seen in a major motion picture. The black-and-white flashback device would be laughable in a film school thesis, and it's embarrassing to see it used here. It took all my strength to stomach the scene at the end where the brothers slowly remove all the Nazi propaganda from Danny's bedroom wall in ultra-dramatic fashion. This is an amateurish production of a bad screenplay that didn't think itself through.<br/><br/>I didn't believe anything that happened here. Why are all the neo-Nazi punks dressed so impeccably? Shouldn't they be lower-class kids wearing hand-me-downs and thrift store bargains? Maybe there would be a few trust-fund lads around, but the whole crowd of Nazi youth looks like they shop at the Gap and J. Crew. We find out that Derek experienced a trauma in prison, and are expected to believe not only that this event completely changed him, but also that Danny would make an immediate character switch as soon as he hears about Derek's prison experience. I didn't buy it, and why should I? This movie thinks I am stupid enough to believe anything I see without questioning it. And isn't that why we have neo-Nazis to begin with?<br/><br/>Don't believe the hype. Leave ""American History X"" to rot, and rent something interesting like ""Do The Right Thing"" or ""Taxi Driver."""
"McFrogg","1","16","44","9 May 2017"," A fascinating look into the minds of Hollywood liberals,
","American History X has a good message. Hate and racism is very bad. Unfortunately, so is the movie. I can't believe that this movie is considered such a masterpiece. I'm not even sure if this movie is serious or not. Is it a piece of liberal propaganda, or is it a satirical comedy made by a conservative who wanted to show us how many liberals see the world? Most likely it's propaganda...but sometimes it's hard to tell.<br/><br/>Because most of the time, it's not even about real racism. Except for some hateful comments, most of what Derek (and his father) says during the dinner table scenes isn't shocking at all. A black person could have said the exact same thing. The filmmakers took valid political positions and added a small pinch of Adolf.<br/><br/>According to American History X, you're racist if you're against affirmative action. The movie also seems to say that black people are animals. They're not responsible for their own actions. They commit acts like rioting and looting because they're scared of white people or angry because of the oppression. <br/><br/>The movie is mostly remembered for two things: the gay prison scene and the curb stomping. Everyone is talking about those two scenes when they bring up the movie. I almost think the filmmakers did it on purpose, they added shocking stuff so that people would talk about it. I remember that all the ""cool"" kids bragged about having seen the part where the nazi is violated in the shower.<br/><br/>There's also a completely pointless sex scene right before the curb stomping. I wonder why the director thought that was a good idea. But then I remember all of the other bizarre stuff in the movie. <br/><br/>Derek's transformation from nice young man to a neo-nazi is not convincing at all. ""It's nagger bullshot, son!"" ""Gee, dad, I guess you're right! Racism is awesome!"" And his transformation from a neo-nazi to Gandhi. ""Haha, a funny magical negro! Who knew that black people had the ability to tell jokes? And he hates the KKK too, what are the odds? We have so much in common..!"" <br/><br/>At the end of the movie, Derek's brother is shot to death by a black kid. It's just a pointless and depressing ending. It doesn't offer any hope at all. <br/><br/>It's sad that American History X is one of the most popular movies about racism. Imagine if they made a movie about real racism, without magical negroes, fake neo-Nazis, liberal propaganda and unnecessary graphic violence and sex. A movie that treated black people like humans. <br/><br/>The real Nazis here are the filmmakers. American History X is just a piece of propaganda made by a modern-day Goebbels, designed to make viewers think that conservatives are Nazis and that black people are helpless animals."

The genre of this film is meant to be uber realism and this was not a likely path to redemption. Sorry if this was enough for you.<br/><br/>There was no where near enough build up of hate between the younger kids which resulted in a high school slaying.<br/><br/>The warmth between the prisoners on laundry duty was a missed opportunity, nothing of substance passed between the 2 of them to merit the benevolence. <br/><br/>The score was great and the graphic violence was done very well, triggering raw emotions. <br/><br/>Finally, affirmative action is mocked by many good people, politicians and social commentators all around the world without a racist bone in their body.

","So Edward Norton is supposed to be a chameleon kind of actor, abode in the upper echelon of thespian professionalism with a distinctive character and absolutely a cut above the rest of the Hollywood illiterates. I've heard of this movie for so long but never intrigued by the signal-blazing poster and preaching-sound plot. But then I watched it by default and become so angry that compelled myself to rant out my rage. Its rub*ish, don't sully your eyes by it.<br/><br/>Honestly, every character is black and white. Long overdue prodigal son who used to be a loving a caring straight A student got lectured by his racist old man and SUDDENLY abandon all his DOUBLE PHD black teacher's words and starting to mutter extreme racist remarks on news report when his ""honest hardworking"" firefighter dad got shot and killed. Then unsurprisingly he was claimed to be brainwashed and apparently become the rabbis of his secret guild. And his uncontrollable ANGER(so symbolic and repetitively accentuated in the movie that you started doubting if the director thinks the audience are all eight year old) moved to his family, to defend his belief and stand out for his horrendous looking lady friend. he even stuffed a chunk of beef into his sister's mouth to shut her up. AND he killed the guys who tried to sneaked his car through the most thrilling way(I didn't know if you put mouth on curbs and kick it could kill a man). I'm flabbergasted how the storyline goes exactly as I predicted(I learned in primary school if you want to salute a kind of concept you first suppressed it and then through a heavenly epiphany you realized the folly of you and the mightiness of the concept, say the virtue of be punctual), I thought maybe deviated a little from the standard via but sadly, sadly it doesn't. the linchpin of the movie got his second life and love education behind bars by his fellow linen worker and a f*ck in the a*s.<br/><br/>Every character is either purely good or evil, all deprived of sanity and love and proper education. The fat bug killer is a racist for a reason, he simply is insolent and grumpy as hell about his life, he eats jelly beans with a bow; the mason-vision gangster are dramatized and demonized to present the very extremity of racism, which itself desensitize the audience and shift the concept of racism to terrorism. Apparently the director itself is undereducated but ridiculously bold to produce a film regarding racism without do much research about the itself. You'd startled by the level of superficiality and phoniness of the film. They even spent 3 mins on a black versus white basketball game.yeah."

The way in which this comes about is scriptwriting at it's worst. There was much to do about the directing but the film is filled, once again, with poor work. Kaye was said to have done his own camera work on cinematography. It's obvious that professionals should have been used.

"robert-temple-1","1","12","33","13 December 2007"," Terrifying film about American Neo-Nazis, full of violence, followed by redemption, but nauseating
","It is doubtful whether this disturbing and horrifying film should ever have been made. It is nauseatingly violent, but then so are the kind of people it is based upon. No sensitive person should try to see this, as it is far, far too horrible. The violence is so sickening that it is intolerable. The entire project is of questionable integrity, even though in the latter half, some justification is offered when there is a major change of heart and mind by the lead character. Edward Norton, one of the world's most versatile film actors, gives another staggering performance, as does Edward Furlong as his younger brother. It is all very well done, but should it have been done, that is the question. This film portrays in a way no mainstream film has ever done the extremes and depths of racist hate cults, and we are left with nothing to speculate about as far as American Neo-Nazis are concerned. By the time you have sat through this, you have seen more swastikas than you could find in 'Triumph of the Will', but these are up close and personal, like Norton's tattooed on his chest. The scenes in prison are so far beyond appalling that we run out of shocked adjectives. If you ever wanted to know how Neo-Nazis think, because you just couldn't wait, here it all is. But have plenty of vomit bags handy. I am inclined to think that this is a piece of exploitation masquerading as a serious social and psychological study. Why not make a film about suicide bombers and decapitating people next? But why stop there? There is always bayoneting babies to move onto after that. Can this sort of thing be justified? The fact that it is a well-made film makes it worse. I think our 'need to know' is spurious, and that the people who made this film are all deeply, deeply sick, and should be ashamed of themselves. This film will only stimulate crazies to emulate the insane racists, and I bet tattoo artists get a lot more business after this. Also, the racist attitudes portrayed and statements made in the film are so disgustingly offensive that no one has ever plumbed such depths in a film, and I believe that such unspeakable evil should not be given publicity, and that such maggot-ridden and rotten things should not be brought out into the light. It is a fallacy to think that by showing them anything constructive can be achieved. Elliott Gould in the film looked shell-shocked at the horror of it all. I know how he feels. He should have walked out of the film, not just out of the house. What was he doing, lending his name to this?"
"jtamburi","5","7","17","16 April 1999"," A Fairy Tale
","American History X is basically a fairy tale.  It is a film about one man's implausible 3-step transformation from a naive high-school kid to a white-supremist Nazi and leader of a skinhead tribe, to an honest caring upstanding citizen who only wants to do the right thing for his family and society at large.  Like I said, a fairy tale.  I won't  reveal any more of the ending that wasn't already revealed on the preview.  Basically it's a mixed happy/sad ending, where the ""happy"" part is that the main character finally comes to terms with who we was, how evil he was, the way his evilness has negatively influenced the lives of other people, and is able to write a nice cheery new chapter in his life.  And all this happens in a short 4 years.<br/><br/>What gets me is how unbelievably intelligent and level-headed the main character (played by Ed Norton) is, and how completely silly his transformation into a skinhead really is.<br/><br/>Meanwhile his kid brother (played by Ed Furlong) who is also reasonably smart, follows in his brother's footsteps like a zombie.  Norton's character is clearly free-thinking and is not one to follow in other people's footsteps, while Furlong is just the opposite.  At least Furlong's character gives the impression that he might flip and go completely nuts at any given time, thereby adding some mystery to the film (Furlong is good at looking like a punk). But the reality is much more like a fairy tail.<br/><br/>So basically the film doesn't know what it wants to be.  One the one hand, it deals with some incredibly moving race issues, and on the other hand we have a children's movie.<br/><br/>I think The Chamber by John Grisham actually did a much better job at portraying a racist who slowly & reluctantly repents and finds the error in his ways, at the last possible moment.  At least in that film, we understand that we're dealing with someone who, at his core, is really not a very nice man.<br/><br/>Just the opposite in X.<br/><br/>(5 out of 10)"

This movie is a big underestimation of the complexity of this issue and it's clearly meant to be watched by people that already agree with the premise that racism is bad, sadly the movie misses the opportunity to be much more thought provoking and ends up being the equivalent of showing a text that reads ""racism is bad"" for two hours... yeah we know that.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION (spoiler-free): This movie is an underestimation of the complexity of the problem of racism and radical hate groups, it's unrealistic and it won't teach you anything new or even entertain you enough to make up for its lack of accurate description of reality. 4/10 not worth it."

Then came 1998 and his beefed-up performance in ""American History X,"" that no one believed he could pull off and then won him a Best Actor Academy Award nomination. I think it's his performance, rather than the movie itself, that people have since reacted so strongly to. He's great, but the movie is a bit of a hot mess.<br/><br/>Norton plays a skinhead who goes to prison for a vile crime and comes out a reformed man, determined to see that his little brother (Edward Furlong) doesn't go down the same path he did. But director Tony Kaye doesn't have a disciplined bone in his body, and the film has too much stuff constantly going on to give the story or its actors their due. It also doesn't help that Furlong, whose character we're supposed to be rooting for, is a vaguely unlikable actor who it's hard to warm to.<br/><br/>If an actor who on paper looked to be more suited to the role than Norton had played the lead, I wonder if this film would have the cult following it does.<br/><br/>Grade: C+"
"namos333","7","4","8","12 October 2002"," oddly dissatisfying
","The problem with ""American History X"" has nothing to do with the acting. Edward Norton and Edward Furlong are both convincing and terrific, despite the fact that Norton's character seems more like a misguided youth than a evil neo-nazi (the brutality of his crimes seemed to exist only to mask this impression).  The fact is that it tries to cram too much into too little. Ideas and characters are presented that are never followed up on and thus the film seems disjointed.  Despite the fact that Norton's character broke through a lot of the typical characteristics that typify the neo nazi, the prison scenes contain characters that exemplify many these stereotypes.  The well rounded characters (such as Guy Torry as the laundry guy in prison) are canceled out by poorly developed ones (Faruiza Balk and Ethan Suplee as a couple of dunce nazi followers).  The flashbacks really aren't that well placed in my opinion.  The opening scene presented  Norton's character with simply too much brutality, and seemed designed to do nothing more than shock the audience.  The scenes that supposedly develop the background of the Norton character are really pointless and do not at all indicate the  nature of his beliefs.  His dad telling him that affirmative action is wrong is not the reason he became a crazed nazi.  Tony Kaye clearly wasn't thrilled with the final product, as evidenced by his bizarre ""Humpty Dumpty"" scandal.  He just didn't get all of what he wanted on to the screen.  The overrated reaction to this movie is hard to explain.  Emotionally, the film is fairly powerful and contains a great ending, though it is a bit too preachy.  The ""hate is bad"" message was really an elementary conclusion that was drawn to a sprawling movie that really should have aimed higher."

","Controversial subjects usually make for interesting movies, and American History X courts controversy in so many ways by examining neo-Nazis, racism, prison violence, and school violence all in the same movie. So American History X is a very interesting film, but it is executed so haphazardly that it becomes hard to enjoy, and it loses most of its potential and some of its power in the process.<br/><br/>The film examines the life and crimes of Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) through the eyes of his younger brother, Danny (Edward Furlong), both whom are ""involved"" in the neo-nazi movement. In exactly what ways they are (and were) involved are examined in the film, much of which is told through flashbacks. It is evident that these two boys have forced much hardship upon their families, evident in the performance of Beverly D'Angelo as the boys' mother. However, the performances of both Norton and Furlong, although adequate, are short of spectacular.<br/><br/>Much of the action of the film is shot in pain-staking slow motion, making everything so over-dramatic that it's almost laughable. McKenna's screenplay is indeed interesting at points, but some of it too gets caught up on formulaic statements and unneeded dialogue. Many of the scenes seem unneeded and seem to need replacement by scenes that give more insight into Danny's mindset. Instead of these scenes, though, the viewer is left with a character who seems somewhat one-dimensional.<br/><br/>Even with the slow motion, Kaye's direction and cinematography are unique enough to grab the viewer's attention, even when it does distract from the rest of the film. Also, the film is thought-provoking in its examination of racial matters, especially as we see through the eyes of characters so prejudiced. Further questioning and thought is provoked by the movie's ending, which is both beautiful and shocking in such an odd way that it almost makes the whole film worthwhile.<br/><br/>It is obvious that this film is unashamed to say what it wants to say. Yet it's still a shame that American History X was not caught on film as something more powerful and profound in its display.<br/><br/>Final Grade: B-."

It has some good moments and the fact that the neo nazi's opinions are put a cross in a well constructed manner, rather than the usual thick headed thug type fashion does make it more uncomfortable and asked more questions of us (perhaps) and of course it has other current flowing under the obvious ones, like the element of prison and what that brings etc etc, but overall this film lacked any subtle moments. Everything is thrown infront of you in an aggressive manner, which i know people will say is the point perhaps, but in my opinion it isn't.

Movie started out well but ended up just another Hollywood piece of garbage. Oh well..."

","The way people talk about this movie, i really thought this was a hollywood masterpiece i had been missing out on for years. After finally having seen it, i can say it was certainly forgettable. The idea and subsequent story actually has a lot of potential, but it is ruined by the movies weird cinematography (black and white to show scenes in the past??) and quite frankly terribly dialogue and acting by everyone except for Norton, who i thought was the only solid actor. Not terrible, not great. Could have been so much better."

"plpregent","6","2","3","24 July 2019"," Despite having both the best of intentions and ambition, ""American History X"" is quite a flawed film.
","I was in my mid-teenage years when I first watched ""American History X"", and certainly thought it was quite a striking picture, both in its message and in its depiction of violence.<br/><br/>Over twenty years later, I can definitely say that this film speaks volumes about numerous worrisome truths that are still plaguing American society today. However, I have to say that the delivery method feels quite pompous and seriously lacks subtlety.<br/><br/>We follow the story of a teenager named Daniel Vinyard (played by Edward Furlong), whose older brother, a skinhead named Derek (played by Edward Norton) is being released from prison, after spending over three years behind the bars for brutally murdering two black gang members. Through a narrative structure that includes numerous flashbacks, we get to see what led Derek to become a leader among a white supremacist gang and commit such a hateful crime. We also get to see how easily influenced Daniel is, trying to follow the same path as his older brother. Derek comes back home as a totally changed man, and as an older brother that feels the urgency to prevent his younger sibling from falling into the same spiral of hate and violence that ultimately ruined his life.<br/><br/>It is a well-known story that the director, Tony Kaye, didn't want his name associated to this film even before its release, due to his disapproval of the final cut, which apparently involves a tone that differs significantly from what he initially had in mind. I have no idea what Kaye's cut of this film was like, and perhaps we will never know, but one thing I can say is this: despite a relevant message altogether, I found that both the characters' psychology and the moral issues that it explores are oversimplified and tackled in a frustratingly superficial way. Some of the dialogue is clumsy and sometimes unnecessary. The best example: Derek didn't need to say ""What did I do"" when holding the bloodied up body of his young brother who just got shot. Also, Derek's transition from being a young man filled with rage and hatred to becoming a completely changed man is quite abrupt and feels very unnatural, and so does Daniel's sudden ""change of mind"", which occurs within the span of barely a couple of minutes, technically. Right after that conversation, they added a quick shot of both brothers running around the deserted street, poking fun at each other right after, just to show that Daniel's moment of clarity paid off. Oh boy. Tried to keep my palm away from my face, but couldn't.<br/><br/>This makes me wonder how badly the film's flaws are due to poor editing choices, and certain parts being left out of the cut that ended up getting released. We will never know, unfortunately.<br/><br/>At the time, Tony Kaye's background as a director was mostly within the world of advertising, which I thought was apparent in a few scenes. On the other hand, other scenes almost felt like they were from a TV movie, which left an overall impression that the direction was uneven. The use of black and white during flashbacks, albeit arguably clichéd, was an artistic choice that paid off visually, as those scenes do look great. That being said, this highly stylized violence left me with mixed feelings, as it certainly contradicts the film's whole point. On that same note, I don't know if the use of slow motion was a result of New Line and Norton's input that ultimately led to the cut that Kaye disowned, but at times it seriously felt conspicuous.<br/><br/>The film's main appeal lies in Edward Norton's performance, which is intense and excellent. Again, some of the dialogue, in my view, is not on point at all, and contributes to blemish the character, along with the scattered, untidy psychological evolution that he goes through. That being said, every time Norton appears on screen, he does phenomenal work. Other notable performances include those of Edward Furlong, Faizura Balk and Beverly D'Angelo, unfortunately playing characters that lack any trace of a nuance whatsoever.<br/><br/>I know how beloved this film is, and I know that this review will probably be very unpopular. I'm not arguing that ""American History X"" does not have a strong and important message, or some really touching moments. Not at all. However, such an important subject matter deserved a more in-depth and thorough look at the psychological evolution of the film's two main characters, because polished visuals and a few tear-inducing moments are no substitute for that in a film that tackles issues of this magnitude. I find its IMDb score of 8.5 to be quite puzzling, to be absolutely honest.<br/><br/>A longer portion of the film's runtime is spent on showing physical and psychological violence in an ostentatious manner than on exploring the mechanisms through which hatred and violence is conveyed within a group of individuals - or a family. And that is a problem.<br/><br/>Despite having both the best of intentions and ambition, ""American History X"" is quite a flawed film that shares traits with most melodramatic TV movies: it takes the easy preachy route and uses psychological shortcuts aplenty rather than thoroughly exploring the social issues that are at its core."

","'American History X (1998)' is an uneasy, sometimes downright uncomfortable film that pulls none of its punches and refuses to make any judgement on its closed-minded characters, even at the cost of potential audience alienation or possible misinterpretation. Its this very fact that gives it its power because it ultimately allows the viewer to come to their own conclusions, trusting them to understand the separation between the film itself and the contemptible characters contained within. Ultimately, it represents a vehement cry against the racism and bigotry rampant within its first two acts and also holds the belief that someone can unlearn these bizarre beliefs which are usually bored into them by an outside source. If it didn't go the distance it wouldn't have been half as successful, perhaps instead feeling like a weak-chinned exploitation piece, and its tragic conclusion may have lost its impact. 7/10"

","awesome movie American history x = fight club + crash + shawshank redumption.<br/><br/>well this is really nice film.It answers many questions I have long awaited an answer to such as what could possibly make someone act as Derek did in this movie, yet left open-ended many others that people such as myself may have. Almost every single scene in the movie was extremely captivating. I can't even go on to say more about the acting, other than if Edward Norton does not win best actor this year, I will go absolutely nuts.Edward Norton is truly fantastic in his role. He is very well believable as a Neo-Nazi as well as the reformed person he later turns into in the movie. It's almost like he's playing 2 different characters and he does that so extremely well. Also really good was Edward Furlong who we all long had not seen in a big production. Furlong and Norton are both acting well together in their scene's are highly believable as two brothers. This movie is exceptional!!! Makes u think, makes you frustrated, makes you wanna scream and even makes you cry! Edward Norton is just phenomenal playing the role of a freak skin head and even more so playing this skin head who finally realizes how stupid he was and tries to protect his younger brother. Edward Furlong also does an amazing job!!! This film is moving in so many ways...I can't even describe how real and heartfelt it felt. I definitely think Edward Norton should have won the Oscar for his performance, cause he was absolutely terrific! I can't get why they didn't gave it to him..."
"classicsoncall","9","2","3","7 January 2012"," ""Has anything you've done made your life better?""
","I've seen a lot of movies and have seen a lot of violence in them - war films, Westerns, horror and even some of those slasher/gore flicks that go so way over the top. For the most part, the violence depicted is far removed from any sense of reality, because after all, it's a movie and the director can be as unrealistic as he wants to get with flying bodies, severed limbs and the like. However the curb stomp by Edward Norton's character on the black hood in the street was probably as visceral an experience that one can get from simply watching the event on screen. I think that comes from internalizing the impact such a trauma can have if it was personally done to you. It's a little hard to put into words, but I hope you can catch my meaning.<br/><br/>What I think the film does effectively is show how a hardened racist like Derek Vinyard (Norton) can slowly come to terms with his prejudices when forced to confront them in a restricted environment. Not only is Derek influenced by his co-worker Lamont (Guy Torry) in the laundry, but also the hypocrisy of the segregated racial groups in the prison yard who break those boundaries for self expediency and personal profit. It's also noteworthy to remark on the character of Cameron Alexander (Stacy Keach), who foments racism and violence from a safe distance, never forcing a confrontation for himself, but only through surrogates like Derek and Seth (Ethan Suple).<br/><br/>If the film does anything, it should help instruct the viewer to rely on one's own life and experiences to see the humanity and good in all people, regardless of race or ethnic background. I'll never understand why racists and haters focus on what's 'different' about others instead of seeing what makes all people the 'same' - a desire to amount to something, be part of a family and have a sense of belonging to a larger community of mankind."
"gavin6942","9","2","3","2 October 2006"," What Happens When People Stop Being Polite And Be Real?
","American History X is the tale of a skinhead (Edward Norton) who ""curb stomps"" a black man and goes to prison. Whiel in prison, he reflects on his younger days and learns that racism is stupid. But when he gets back out, can he save his brother (Edward Furlong), who has followed in his footsteps? Also stars Fairuza Balk, Avery Brooks and the dad from ""Boy Meets World"".<br/><br/>This is a very powerful movie because of one thing: its rawness. Raw is the only word I know that describes the intensity of the violence and the prison situations. You won't find this on ""The Birdman of Alcatraz"" (though maybe on ""Oz"").<br/><br/>Also, the movie tackles a real world issue: racism. Unfortunately, it does so in a very exaggerated way (not all racists are skinheads), drags in things like affirmative action (which is racial but not necessarily racist or anti-racist) and seems to focus on blacks. In the world of 1998 maybe blacks were heavily discriminated against, but by 2006 it seems that being black is not nearly as bad as being Hispanic or Arab. (Not that blacks are equal yet, but much more so than other groups.) We all know Edward Norton is a great actor (""Fight Club"") and many will rave over Edward Furlong (""Brainscan""). Avery Brooks tries hard to break away from the Star Trek stereotype (but fails). Fairuza Balk is great (at least as good as ""The Craft"", much better than ""The Waterboy"" but not as good as ""Return to Oz""). The dad from ""Boy Meets World""? Don't know his name... he's the dad from ""Boy Meets World"".<br/><br/>A great film, but don't watch it with your kids unless they're old enough to understand adult situations. This is ""Schindler's List"" for Americans. Could be a great way to start a discussion on a difficult issue."
"sempai","2","8","21","13 October 2002"," Trite and Moronic Sensationalism
","Reminiscent of Spike Lee's Malcolm X who's main character had a change of heart and mind in prison that was followed by an epiphany when he saw men and woman of all races alike searching for answers, American History X unfortunately fails to demonstrate the most important element of any cathartic journey: Soul Searching.<br/><br/>This is an obvious fiction of a boy who filled the vacuum of his missing father with a figure who would do his father's murder justice. The idea is interesting. However, it attempted to gather sympathy (and successfully) for the boy's plight by taking pot shots at easy targets. Derek is portrayed early in the movie preaching a succinct set of more than half-baked ideals which magically disintegrated with his ""change of heart"" in prison; when all his better angels kindly removed his indignation. The most insulting nugget of sanctimoniousness is Sweeny's comment ""Ask yourself one question...has this made your life better?"". Folks, when fighting for ANY cause, no-one ever expects the quality of one's life to improve. Did Ghandi's life improve by fasting?!<br/><br/>Frankly, this is a very tough and serious subject that deserves more than a `change of heart'; it also demands a change of mind. It demands a journey of thought and reason. But in Hollywood who needs reason when you have tears, right? Thus we're left with a serious theme that is trampled by trite and exaggerated sensationalism.<br/><br/>I believed at first that the sanctimoniousness was Tony Kaye's. But perhaps this touch is Edward Norton's who apparently monkey-ed around in post-production to the point where Tony Kaye wanted to use a pseudonym (I don't blame him). This wouldn't surprise me after seeing Norton's naive tear-jerker Keeping the Faith. Unfortunately, in Norton I'm ""Losing the Faith"".<br/><br/>This movie could've been much better if it was created for grown ups. But then it would have to have been created by grown ups."

The white guys betrayed and raped him in prison and the black guy told the other black guys to leave him alone! Now he'll see why he was wrong to be racist!"") Hopefully the American public isn't stupid enough to let such movie-makers talk down to us.

Many people did it, Kobe did it, Tyson did it, not only because of their abilities, but they deserve our respect in some places. There are no perfect people, no gold and no red gold. Of course, they also have bad things to do. But who are you at fault? Maybe it is the poor who are alone, and the rich are the best. Use your own ability to change the people around you, change the people around you, and all beings are equal.
The racial issue has always been a pain in the hearts of Americans. Although we have seen progress from the liberation of slaves to Martin Luther King to now Obama, we have seen many innocent lives and lives on this difficult journey. The painful soul was trampled and trampled. From the teachings of Wen Ya's father to him, he can fully see the deep-rooted discrimination in some white people. When he reflected on himself from reality and reassessed his previous value judgment, the contradictory resentment accumulated by the two races for many years made the tragedy come again. We don't know what kind of entanglement will make him choose. There is still a long way to go before trying to eliminate the suspicions of race.
Looking back at us, it seems that ethnic contradictions are not so sharp, but is this really the case? I am a protected and sheltered instant gainer. Tibetans and Xinjiang people have no way of knowing their inner feelings, but they can understand their anger or helplessness even from very sporadic messages. What is more terrible is that we cannot sort it out as slowly as the United States, and gradually repair and make up. We can only watch everything happen and fall to the abyss with everyone."

When I first saw Edward Norton's character kick that robber's head on the curb, I actually felt my head split open in unison with the guy and my heart plummet into my stomach. The shot that followed also really got me, in which Norton, as he is being arrested, puts his hands on his head and turns around. His eyes are wide open and staring at his dumb-struck younger brother, his eyebrows raised, and his smile stretching ear to ear. Across his face are etched the words, ""I have no regrets. Absolutely no regrets."" The film is a shocking and tremendously powerful one that has a strong message about the immorality of Nazism and racism. It's a visit to a world that most of us hope to never encounter, let alone join. Surprisingly, the graphic content in this film doesn't compel me to give it a lower rating.

Overall the movie is relatively disturbing in the beginning, but by the end of the first hour and then towards the end the movie starts to resemble a coming of age movie.

"harrylosborne","7","1","1","7 June 2019"," Nazism from a new angle, but too reliant on its lead performance
","Highly regarded and seen as one of Edward Norton's most prominent roles to date, American History X is a dark retelling of racial tensions and Nazism in modern America, highlighting the unending vicious circle of conflict. Personally, Norton is leant heavily on to bring this film to life: the concept is without a doubt interesting, but doesn't go deep enough to really highlight the beliefs and thoughts of those so opposed to other belief systems and races.<br/><br/>The story is self-explanatory enough: following a stint in prison, Derek Vinyard (Norton) tries to distance himself from his Nazi past, before realising his younger brother Danny (capably played by Edward Furlong) is already deeply integrated. Flashbacks of Vinyard's past (all shown in black and white) detail parts of his family's history, explaining his journey from one of the most hardened affiliates of the party to a far more self-aware character. Throughout the film he tries his best not to let Danny get sucked in further, but every action has an equally damaging consequence.<br/><br/>Infamous for one scene in particular (a failed carjacking upon which a lack portion of the film is based), American History X actually isn't as revolutionary as it has been considered to be. No doubt interesting and somewhat thought provoking, some of the scenes seem gratuitous (both in violence and story-fleshing), fairing to really elevate the film. Norton himself is the gem, but without his stellar outing, it's hard to believe that this controversial film would truly be remembered today."

","Kaye helms one of the best films exploring racism in recent memory. This film has excellent direction, screenplay, settings, cinematography, score and acting. The entire cast delivers exceptional performances. In particular Norton, Furlong, Brooks, Falk and Keach are superb. Norton commands the silver screen and his performance is absolutely mesmerizing. The plot revolves around a neo-Nazi, Derek and his younger brother, Danny. Danny is assigned the task of writing a paper on his beliefs by his school's guidance counselor, Dr. Sweeney after submitting a book report on, ""Mein Kampf"". Dr. Sweeney is the former teacher of Danny's brother Derek. As Danny sits at his computer to start the paper the story of his family's history begins. We find his brother Derek is a very intelligent neo-Nazi who spreads his hatred, propaganda and recruits for the local chapter leader Cameron. Derek is doing time for committing a heinous act of vengeance after his dead father's truck is stolen. During his time in jail Derek is subjected to a brutal assault and is visited by his former teacher. This experience opens his eyes as to why he embraced the neo-Nazis after a life growing up in an environment of violence, hate and racism. Upon his release Derek's mission is to save his family and change his brother's path while struggling with old associates and his own past. This leads to a confrontation with Cameron and a equally eye opening story he tells Danny. The plot is intense, violent, thought provoking, insightful, heartwrenching, disturbing and has a poetic ending. There are many memorable scenes and not just quotes, but speeches in this film. After his reunion with his brother, Danny's report starts off as, ""People look at me and see my brother"". If only that was not the case, but sometimes it takes tragic events to see things differently, change one's beliefs, end the violence and alter one's future. This remains one of the very best modern day films probing racism and violence. It is a sublime and brilliant work of art in it's genre."

It introduced the characters and the environment in a not-so-linear-timeline which is a plus because it kept me wondering not only what's going to happen but also what had happened while still keeping me engaged in what is happening. Hard to pull off this kind of method of storytelling, but he (the screenwriter, i guess) nailed it. At least to a certain point towards the end of the movie where everything started to crumble. That ""certain point"" was right after the father scene. That moment was the climax and the pinnacle of this film. It made the ""not-so-linear-timeline storytelling method"" all the more perfect for the movie and contributed to very writing of this scene. But that's not what we're talking about. We're talking about how EVERYTHING began to fall apart afterwards... HOW? Ok, let's take a look:<br/><br/>1] The main character had a belief, that belief had roots buried in his soul, a belief he lived by through YEARS of his life. You'd think that would mean something, right? ""Oh, my fellow white men rapped me and beat me, maybe they're not so good after all. And oh, i befriended this Black guy, maybe they're not so bad"". I don't think that's how it works in real life. But then again you need to recognize the problem to fix it. Was he a racist? A nazi? A white-supremacist? All of the above? Doesn't matter, it should've took something more deep and meaningful to get rid of any of those, let alone all.<br/><br/>2] Why? What purpose did the murder of the brother serve?

Whereas Tony Kaye's masterpiece plays the white tiles, it can be said that Richard Wright's Native son plays the black one. Both stories are displaying a different perspective on the topic of racism, both do it so well, and both are oh-so-important.<br/><br/>This film is appealing to the white crowd - the crowd that through generations have oppressed the other crowd for being less, when we are all equal human beings created together - to try and make people realize, as Derek realizes. The feature follows Derek Vineyard (Edward Norton), or rather his younger brother, Daniel (Edward Furlong) and their lives as neo Nazis and their road to redemption. It begins with Derek being released from prison, after serving 3 years for brutally killing two black criminals trying to steal his car. During his time away, Daniel, who worships Derek like a God, has followed in his footsteps and now Derek must try to keep him off that path. A different Derek came out than the one that came in, which is off-putting to Daniel as he struggles to cope with this new reality.
The motion picture is filmed alternating between colour and black and white. The part in colour standing for the present, and the black and white part for the flashbacks. They provide an acumen into Derek's life and development and there are clear connections between flashes from the past where he is seen as an innocent young boy realising the equal worth of all humans, but also the tormenting from his father to steer him onto an awful direction, and the coloured future scenes where a now salvaged Derek, who no longer is a little boy, resists the temptations of his racist friends.<br/><br/>As for my opinion of the film, after seeing it twice, I can say nothing but that it's a masterstroke by the creators. No less credit can be given to the outstanding performances of the cast. Edward Norton keeping up with the rapid changes in his character, and Beverly D'Angelo putting on a truly devastating act. Moreover, you could argue that the film is too violent, but not according to me. The violence only helps provide the message of the film. Tony Kaye really nailed this racially loaded movie and provides for an entertaining show with a meaningful message.<br/><br/>Whether American History X will go down in history as the neo Nazis favourite movie or a true life- changer that hits close to home for many struggling white racist people, is perhaps unnecessary to discuss. There will always be people who simply doesn't care for humanity, or anything else for that matter. What does matter, however, is that movies such as this one is not only important but a must to show to young people in particular. Even with all the violence, it shows what could happen if you go down the wrong path."

","American History X stars off very brutal and meaningless. But slowly as the film proceeds you scene after scene you feel that the main character played wonderfully by Edward Norton is another person then the terrifying psychopath you see from the first insane violent scene that is just good damn pointless. And when Nortons character changes for the better, is it his little brother played by Edward Furlong that is the new racist black sheep in the family that the big brother have to set on the path of good before its to late. This is the best film about racism ever made. It just sucks you in to this unfair world where nothing makes sense at all. I just love that a bad guy becomes good and finds his humanity its makes you feel good cause there is always a light in the end of the tunnel when evil appears. As I said before, the acting by the two Edwards is amazing and the movie just show how bad racism really is and why you should defently avoid at all cost."

","What a bunch of self-righteous, self-serving, pretentious psychobabble! I am not sure where to begin attacking this film for the farce it is, but I guess I should start by saying that this has very little if anything to do with white pride or racialism, in this country or elsewhere. Believe me I've seen a load of unbelievable farces in my time, but they all seemed entertaining somehow, except this, I don't know perhaps it's my experience with the real-life racialist movement here.<br/><br/>I really did like the way, that Derek got three years for blasting away a couple of thugs who were threatening his life by breaking into his home, and when he's released it tries to make you feel guilty when the cool, righteous, and enlightened negro isn't getting out anytime soon, since he committed crimes that obviously weren't in the name of self-defense.<br/><br/>Also, I'm surprised that Derek's incarceration in the joint, led to his ultimate rehabilitation as a racist. In reality, it probably would've affirmed his previous views tenfold.<br/><br/>Another thing I liked was the attack on the family. The writers portray Derek's father, for instance, as some workaholic, redneck cop w/ a Marlon Brando attitude towards blacks and the system. The emotion of this scene, is almost enough, to make one feel ashamed for harboring a rational, sound opinion or belief on a critical issue such as that. It's revolting.<br/><br/>There are probably a few points I could rag on, but one thing that really caught my eye, which I found disturbing were the others' reviews. Almost no one here spoted the political agenda of this film, as another propaganda film, against White America, and that's truly shocking. When will people wake up around here, and smell the coffee?<br/><br/>This review may not be too popular, but I could care less, after all, opinions are only opinions."

After that treatment he will learn not to be an evil white racist Nazi anymore, but his massive past racial sins will continue to hunt him anyway and in the end his beloved brother will have to die because of the older brother's hate and evil white Nazi racism.<br/><br/>Only a clearly paranoid director with racial hang-ups could have come up with this script."
"Spleen","5","7","18","9 September 2001"," Let's not get carried away over this mediocre film
","This is the story of a white supremacist who changes his ways when someone points out to him that all his campaigning only served to make his life even worse than it had been before.  Well, yes.  He's in prison.  Other people at other times have been put in prison for waging battles they believed to be just; sometimes, the battles WERE just.  We wouldn't have wanted Hitler's opponents, for instance, to give up and go with the flow, just because that would have made their lives easier - would we?<br/><br/>Moreover, Danny's racism had intellectual grounds.  When he goes into his rants he offers reasons - honest to goodness reasons - why others should believe what he believes.  Does anyone ever offer him or us opposing reasons?  Not that I noticed; instead, they look at him as they'd look at someone who spoke out of turn in church.  Those who agree with Danny will feel cheated, with reason; those who disagree will (or ought) feel even more cheated, with even greater reason.<br/><br/>I haven't given you the full story.  While he's in prison, Danny actually MEETS a black man, for the first time in his life.  He changes his mind partly because he learns something, which is what prevents the film from being infuriating.  As drama, it's distinctly so so.  The characters are worth knowing, listening to, and following - even if the conclusion is an unmotivated cheat.<br/><br/>Smack in the middle of Ordinary Road, that's where this film is.  I suspect it found its way onto the IMDb top 250 list not because anyone really loved it, but because nobody really disliked it."

"emdoub","5","5","12","29 November 2005"," A tremendous disappointment
","Great casting, excellent acting, marvelous cinematography. Truly, a finely-crafted film.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, all of this wonderful story-telling expertise is used to tell a story that is as satisfying as one that ends with ""and then the little boy fell out of bed and woke up"".<br/><br/>*** MAJOR SPOILERS FOLLOW *** The ""moral"" of this story is, apparently, that it's racist to stand up to bullies if they're African-American, and it'll get you shot - and it'll be the fault of your racist older brother, because he led you down a skinhead path.<br/><br/>The skinheads are portrayed as remarkably unlovely people. It's true - racism is ugly, and it's possible that skinheads are that badly over the top in their social skills and attitude. But the cinematic debate that is the heart of this film is remarkably one-sided. We are not shown examples that disprove the racial stereotypes examined, we're shown examples of the people with legitimate complaints over-reacting, or degenerating into absurd complaints.<br/><br/>This movie examines race relations in the USA - and Ghu knows that they need to be looked at. Racism is a real problem. Pointing a finger at white extremists is not going to be effective - looking at all aspects of the problem may help, though it may be less comfortable. It's a complex problem - the simple source that this movie looks at does little to illuminate that. In portraying the wrong-headedness of white supremacists while glossing over their legitimate complaints, the movie becomes racist itself.<br/><br/>For a far better movie that examines this problem, I highly recommend Crash, which can be seen at http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0375679/"
"MatBrewster","7","5","12","14 March 2005"," Passionate, flawed film
","It has been many years since I have seen this film. My memory attested it to be an excellent picture that meaningfully discussed issues as heavy as race relations, prejudice, and hatred. Unfortunately my memory is a little at fault, and upon viewing it this time I found it a bit disappointing. The film sets its sights to the heavens, and while succeeding in many ways, it could not attain such a lofty height. In trying to cover all the basis in such a thorny issue as race relations it cheats a bit in its storytelling. But we'll cover more of that in a bit.<br/><br/>The plot involves a young, white Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) and the tumultuous 24 hours after his release from prison for killing two black men, while they were trying to steal his car. Much of the story is told in a flash backed black and white. Here we learn that Derek was a Neo-Nazi skinhead leader who has had a change of heart after his stint in prison. Post prison time is being spent trying to keep his brother, Danny (Edward Furlong) from following in his footsteps. A path he is already walking down.<br/><br/>This is a powerful, moving film. Reading the boards on IMDb will attest to lives being changed through watching it. It works best when it shoots for an emotional response, rather than an intellectual one. Scenes such as when Edward Nortan's skin head leader rallies the troops to loot a local grocer, or the opening scene where we see Norton kill the two aforementioned black men, or a traumatic rape scene in prison, emit a guttural response from its viewers. It is in such scenes that we are rallied into discourse on the issues presented. Yet when the film gets talky it falls short of its ideals. It presents nothing beyond the general rhetoric you can find just about anywhere. In fact most of the rhetoric is spewed from the Neo-Nazi skinheads, and this type of discussion can be found every other day on day time talk shows. There is little in way of discussion from the rational, unprejudiced mind.<br/><br/>There are two powerful performances from Edward Norton and Edward Furlong. At this point Norton was already beginning to take his role as the new Robert DeNiro, who had previously taken his turn as the new Marlon Brando. Let's hope he escapes the fate of mediocrity that they fell into. Furlong who once made Arnold Schwarzenegger look like Laurence Olivier with such a wooden performance, here has finally made himself worthy of attention. He gives a fine performance here, as a young man struggling with the passionate feelings of youth.<br/><br/>Tackling an issue as heady as racism in America is a worthy, yet difficult cause. It proves to be too much for first time screenwriter David McKenna and director Tony Kaye. Trying to condense their story into regulation movie time they either skipped over completely or barely touched on some important issues. To give reasons for Derek's turn as a skinhead we are only allowed one small dinner table conversation with his father who spews some hateful race sentiments. This and his fathers murder at the hands of black addicts in a crack house, whom he was trying to save from a fire must suffice for an intelligent, middle class youths turn into a Nazi. Likewise his subsequent salvation in prison is not dwelt on enough to give us sufficient reasons for this turn of heart. Yes, the skinheads in prison are hypocrites, and yes the rape scene is brutal enough to turn away from their midst. But, his relationship with the black coworker, Lamont (Guy Torry) is not enough to change the heart of such hatred. Torry gives a fine performance, and does enough to show Derek that all blacks aren't as vile as the rhetoric made him believe, but are jokes about sex really going to make a skinhead believe in the goodness of the black race? In searching for a cause behind the Neo-Nazi scene in America the filmmakers seem to point directly towards the intense feelings of anger found in adolescence and the need to fit in with some social group. And rightly, these two issues play powerfully on the minds of many in the skinhead culture. But the issue goes deeper than this, and it is here, again, that this film misses the mark. Just as Derek dismisses issues of poverty, and social position in the plight of the black man this film seems to skim over some of the deeper motivation behind racism.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. This is a powerful, well made film. There is plenty to chew upon and discuss. It is, in fact, a good film to watch with others and bring into light an important debate. Yet when I watch it I can't help but think of how it could have been better, how it could have reached the heights it was reaching for.<br/><br/>Like this review?

Empire Magazine claimed that Edward Norton did not win an Oscar for his performance one of the greatest Oscar injustices of all time. And I completely agree. Some of Norton's racist monologues were so convincing they bordered on being scary. The rest of the cast did great as well. I do think, however, that they could have selected a better actor to play the younger brother, Danny, but that is a nit pick, the actor in the film did fine but I just think someone could have given a more compelling dramatic performance.<br/><br/>Overall, what I loved most about the film was the fact that it shows racism for what it is, something that is taught, how naÃ¯ve people can be led to believe anything if their circumstances call for it. The disturbing scenes where very disturbing and encapsulated the sheer lack of humanity that comes with such racist cults, such as, in this case, the Neo-Nazi's.

Perhaps the most powerful image is of Edward Norton walking towards the camera, hair buzz cut and swastika tattoo popping against his skin. There was good stuff like that in the movie. Bad stuff was that this movie should've been about the younger brother. I mean, it starts with him narrating, it opens with him. Is he not the main character? Why is Ed Norton here stealing every scene like it's his movie? Get the eff out of here Norton. Uninstall yourself from this film.

","I was curious to see what other people thought of this movie, and am genuinely surprised to see this ranked so highly in IMDb polls.<br/><br/>What are the sins of American History X? First of all, the narrative structure is confused, to no good purpose. By showing Edward Norton's jail-stay in flashback, when we already know he's grew disillusioned with the movement, all dramatic interest is removed from the scenes. And the method of his conversion was so trite as to be laughable. While his prison scenes should have been the most powerful part of the movie, they just felt like a waste of time (and using B&W for the past is such an embarrassingly Hollywood device).<br/><br/>Secondly, the script is just terrible. You feel embarrassed for the actors as they're forced to talk entirely in polemic. Characters just didn't talk or relate to each other in a way similar to how people talk or relate to each other. And I felt American History X's take on violence was too cartoonish, where it should have felt genuine. The scenes felt adapted from action movies, whether the scene was sufficiently brutal or not doesn't make it better or worse.<br/><br/>You have to review artwork based on what the artist was trying to do, and how well he did it. The movie was trying to provide insight in the neo-Nazi mentality, while providing insight into the real cause of the racial violence. However, the unrealistic characters and the Hollywood-ish take on violence left the movie flat in both regards."

That is, there are two matching sides, two gangs: on the one hand a bunch of obnoxious nazi skinheads, on the other African-Americans. Not to mention that every relevant African-American character on this movie (by relevant I mean a character who can be seen during ten seconds or more) is a punk, an out-law or a member of gang, -or like Dr. Sweeney, a former member of a gang. Also it should be noted that the director of this thing, underhandedly but also coarsely, drops the idea that the nazi violence is some sort of a reaction against a preceding insult: Nazis are bad, but nazi violence is what you get when African-Americans, Koreans and Mexicans move to your neighborhood, get the all the jobs, win the basket-ball plays and date attractive white women.<br/><br/>Intentions behind this libel remind me of the Nazis from the movie Bullet Proof Monk who set a Human Right organization in order to hide their actual intentions.<br/><br/>And last but not least, have you counted all those shower slow motion takes.

","I wanted this film to be good.  I wanted it to be what it looked like--a stirring, difficult to watch, challenging portrayal of racism in modern America.  It just missed too many boats to do that. But in fairness, I'll talk about it's good points first.  The basic premise is great, a truly remarkable way to address American racism.  Focus on one town and more specifically one family...really good (I'd like to refer you to the TNT movie ""Freedom Song"" as a film that more successfully deals with racism by looking at one town deeply rather than the whole country shallowly).  Some really good acting from Norton and Furlong, also D'Angelo. Also succeeds in being, if nothing else, shocking.  The EVENTS of the film, in a synopsis, are genuinely moving, and I think a really good film could have been made out of such a premise.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the quality of a movie is not just based on subject matter.<br/><br/>The flaws are far more numerous and deadly. The script was really dull, only one good line, and lots of really hollow scenes.  The exposition towards the beginning is artless--police reports and news footage to give us character backgrounds?  That may not sound so terrible, but it really stood out to me as insultingly trite. Also takes too long at the beginning to get started.  We spend over an hour wondering what it was that finally converted Norton and the answer is underwhelming.  I was trying to decide if it would be sudden epiphany or gradual coming to understand.  The answer?  It's neither.  The black guy he works with in the prison cracks some jokes, Norton finds himself laughing, and bang, all his racism gone.  Right.  Ditto Furlong's character.  The movie takes less than 24 hours (not counting flashbacks), and in that time Furlong goes from being a Hitler-in-training to the most understanding fellow around.  How?  His brother (Norton) tells the story of how the black guy he worked with in prison, etc., etc.  Sorry, I needed more of a struggle there, then I'd see his newfound tolerant convictions as being stronger. Many of the characters, as other people note, are one-dimensional, most unfortunately the main secondary character, Furlong's teacher who talks Norton through his conversion.  This fault ties in with a much bigger one. It seems like everyone in the town is concerned primarily with racism. Obviously, it's a movie about racism, but when the only two cliques in the prison were black guys and neo-Nazis, it felt too contrived.<br/><br/>Sorry, like I said, good idea, poor execution.  A shame, it could have been good."

","I think a lot more could have been done with this movie.  The scenes were very realistic and really got the audience to experience what was happening. Edward Norton is brilliant as he moves from one segment of his life to another.  The use of b&w and colour was effective, albeit not very original.<br/><br/>My major disappointment is the total unrealistic change of heart of the Vinyard brothers.  In a matter of four months (from the rape to the parole), Norton's character goes from full-blown Neo-Nazi racist to mild-mannered boy next door.  The same goes for the ""daddy breakfast"" scene.  Norton goes from one opinion to a totally contradictory opinion in a matter of minutes. How are we supposed to believe this?<br/><br/>Maybe the story should have been played out over a longer period of time and the events swaying the characters opinions more dramatic."

When Norton grimaces after slo-mo action sequence (action b pic 101), his eyes seem to say 'look into my face and see the horror!' I looked hard and found nothing. This film is playschool meets Nazis and it just does not gel. Interested in movies about skinheads, without conventional plot lines supported by cookie cutter players and timeworn twists? See Tim Roth in 'Made in Britain' and Russell Crowe in 'Romper Stomper.' No bs films that tell it like it is. Violent they may be, but violence can't be gratuitous when it is central to the plot. I wish I could say the same for American History x - i.e Norton giving his foe a pavement sandwich. This is Kaye, and/or New Line's way of saying 'we're not afraid to shock!

Very lame, and very obvious.<br/><br/>When a game of basketball is played between the skinheads and the blacks to stake claim over some territory, and the blacks lose, they simply walk away angrily as if something is really stopping them.

Not only does he decide to do this in the middle of a school day, in school, but he just stands there after he shoots him. I understand why, but again, very unrealistic.<br/><br/>There are all sorts of unrealisms like that throughout the movie. The list is quite long. Aside from that, Norton's acting was good, but most of the rest of the acting in the movie was done by actors who just couldn't handle it.<br/><br/>This movie has probably gotten such praise because of the subject matter, combined with: lots of drama and tragedy and hope this and reformation that, plus Edward Norton, who is himself a good actor, but still highly over-rated.<br/><br/>To sum this up, American History X was an oversimplification and consistently unrealistic."

This movie seems to lean heavily towards the Neo-Nazis by explaining their motives in depth and presenting most of the black characters as heartless stereotypical gangsters. The few exceptions to this are two characters who seemingly only exist to better the racists as if it's their job.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm giving it a 3 because it somewhat tries to send a good message while still being confusingly sympathetic towards one side of a double edged sword (at best)"

But hell no, it only makes me realize how serious and impotent America's gun control policy is. Are you going to blame racism when a freaking high school student is able to get hold of a gun so easily? When weapons that are so powerful such as guns are so handy and prevalent, killing is just a matter that could be done so easily. When something could be done very easily, would its happening be a surprise? It just happens, like all other easy matters like dropping a glass on the floor. You're not gonna blame on anything for such things. It just happens. Love and peace propaganda will only appear feeble and useless, and the safety of your life can't rely on human's subjectivity. I don't know America's gun policy well, but if in fact it's strictly conducted all the time, then my anger over this film is justified for it exaggerates the reality just for its dramatic effects.

","The beginning was intriguing, middle kinda drowned it with Edward's temperament arguing with the family. The biggest thing about the movie is the sad end. Anyhow loved how the actors played. White ""bigotry,"" either in a current or historical context, is a favourite Hollywood theme. The films they churn out frequently portray society as ""dominated"" by a cruel caste of Whites who are grotesquely unfair towards minorities. These ""victimized"" minorities are presented as tolerant, open, understanding, calm, gentle and virtuous. In contrast, Whites are portrayed as brutally insensitive, oppressive, intolerant, hateful, violent, greedy, narrow-minded and destructive. These films show how the mean spiritedness of White Gentiles deeply hurts angelic minorities, who are at a loss to understand such raw hatred. Frequently, they feature a benevolent minority with tremendous patience and moral conviction who seeks to exorcise the poisonous racism demonstrated by the White characters (the very preachy Guess Who's Coming to Dinner starring Sydney Poitier is a shining example). The hypocrisy of reinforcing such crude racial stereotypes, when the prime message of these preachy films is that stereotypes should be eliminated, is seemingly lost on those who make them. The twisting of reality in the service of a ""progressive"" cause. a controversial essay near the beginning. The portrayal of White people as gullible and easily manipulated by ""misinformation"" promulgated by charismatic ""bigots."" A main character who, through deception, is rapidly transformed from being naive and innocent into a prominent neo-nazi/skinhead activist. A reversal and atonement for this neo-nazi/skinhead association. A link, or continuum, established between well-articulated and justifiable White racial frustration and neo-Nazism/skinhead-ism. Crude attempts to shock the audience with exaggerated scenes involving violent Whites who batter, kill and/or severely abuse minorities. Questions raised and dropped, which if stressed, would have made the story more true-to-life and insightful."

","This is the only film i have seen which really tackles racism in a realistic and intelligent way. The Ed Norton character is an intelligent and articulate individual who convincingly preaches the twisted logic of racism. The film manages to convey most psychological explanations of racism - the authoritarian personality,the scapegoat hypothesis, in-group out-group bias, transference, etc, without feeling preachy. I can't think of a more socially important or responsible film than this. Derek's emotional oddessy is both moving and disturbing, with all points of view given equal airing, no matter how extreme. Personally I found the question asked of Derek 'Has anything you have done made your life better?' a stark and penetrating wake up call for anyone who is unhappy. The ending has been criticised for being overly emotional but I thought it was appropriate, Derek gets hurt by former chosen enemies who have not yet learnt the lesson he has. This makes us question whether Derek was wrong in the first place. This is a complicated film about a difficult subject which should be required viewing in all schools. The ultimate message is to do your best and try to get along with other people. Its not just about racism, its about personal choice, do we live to hate or do we try to make life better for ourselves and others. The director walked away from the film, my question is if he was unhappy with this cut, what would his version be like? This version is a technical, artistic and emotional triumph."

Tony Kaye's directing did not look professional. <br/><br/>In addition, the plot was down the drain for me because it only explored a very tiny piece of the racial subject matter. David Mckenna's screenplay was absolutely preachy. It did not let the audience have access to their perspectives. In my thoughts, it made the characters behave like puppets instead of organic. Derek Vinyard behaved more like a puppet being pulled by its master than any other normal human being. I hardly felt anything from the storyline because of the lack of depth.

Some scenes (like the one establishing Derek's father's racist credentials) don't work because their messages are too obvious. The pathos of the final scenes are diluted somewhat by a flagrant disregard for police procedure, which almost pushes the film into melodrama territory.<br/><br/>I wonder what the film would have been like if director Tony Kaye had been allowed to complete his edition of it. As it stands, it's a thought-provoking and mostly uncompromised glimpse of the racial tension that simmers in every mixed-race culture.

","Edward Norton deservedly received tons of praise for his performance in this movie.  Edward Furlong seems to spend the entire movie looking meaningfully at what's going on around him. I found parts of the plot a bit unbelievable.  Specifically, Edward Norton was redeemed by a friendly black laundry worker who was able to amuse with comic routines.  This black laundry worker appeared to have no knowledge of Edward Norton's vicious crimes, yet was able to hold back an entire prison group from murdering Edward. I usually like Stacy Keach but found his role depicted him as a buffoon. His character was highly intelligent with great organizational skills -- why was it hidden? Beverly D'Angelo gave a wonderful performance as the mother.  She is an actress with a wide range and q;uite believably pulls off her role as the mother (and widow) of a family who racially hates."

","American History X had me gripped from the opening credits to the very end and is so strong for so many reasons. I actually found it hard for my brain to switch off when I went to bed afterwards, as it made such an impact I couldn't stop thinking about it.<br/><br/>All of the black and white flashback scenes are completely captivating and are perfectly balanced with the present day story. The neo-nazi beliefs that the Vinyard brothers share are not just simply portrayed - they are explored in such a way that we discover seeds and roots and how the two characters have sunk to having such ideologies.<br/><br/>The writers, along with Edward Norton and his incredible portrayal of Derek, the eldest brother, did a remarkable job of making you truly believe that the characters were capable of redemption, something they started building on early on, which carried the film the whole way through.<br/><br/>Every character no matter how small provided interesting roles and thought provoking interactions and every single scene felt integral to the story.

","What is faith and what is the power of faith? Perhaps even the parties themselves have no way to explore, and religion, ideals, and goals may all become indispensable members in the process of belief formation. The lack of faith is undoubtedly terrible, but the hidden dangers of evil beliefs are even more unimaginable. Most of the thought-provoking and large-scale shocking cases in history are also examples of distortions in faith. But Tony Kaye chose a more painful process. He stripped the coat of faith subversion and exposed this difficult transformation process nakedly to the world, but it is also so that he can deeply touch the heart of the audience.

Only Edward Norton did not manage to cry in acting only in the last scene. A type of movie you need to add to your list of movies to watch.<br/><br/>But there are no disadvantages in the movie. Can't a movie be made without putting a sex scene in the movies? As soon as the movie starts, it begins with a distinctly erotic scene. There should not be such scenes in a beautiful film criticizing racism. In fact, not all films should have erotic scenes. It imposes bad things on people's subconscious.

The first one simply points out the racist drawings about the Black and white people in America and the second one recalls us that the Black & white period were people who seem to be colorless. American History X is none other than that. The subject is so strong and it has its world appeal. It looks familiar not only in America but also in the entire world. Racism and important topic which was talked, discussed and rectified (up to a mark) all-time ago but it has its significance in these times also. We are unable to eradicate it. And that core element swings through each and everyone which indirectly points to secularism and the shut down of secularist vision. Racism has strong roots nowadays also. When it comes to the film, mainly it revolves around the character of Norton, his subjective consequences, and his mind stage from wrong to right and his relieving part. In the end, there comes another beginning of the circle where he carries his brother's shot dead body. The politics is just between black and white similarly it was the politics in between right and wrong."

","American History X, directed by Tony Kaye, is the story of an American Neo-Nazi (Edward Norton) who decides to abandon his cause, and now has to stop his younger brother (Edward Furlong) from going down the same path as he did.<br/><br/>As one might have guessed, it is quite a heavy film, and light-hearted movie goers may want to take caution. It is however a movie that everyone should see at least some time in their life, as it teaches a very important message; violence is not the way.<br/><br/>The main highlight of the film is Norton's performance. He is simply excellent as Derek Vinyard, and after seeing him as the compassionate big brother in one scene, and as a totally unhinged and chilling psycho in the next (flashbacks), you really understand what range he has got. His Academy Award nomination was well deserved. Edward Furlong plays Danny Vinyard, the younger brother. Although I have never been quite a fan of his voice, I suppose that is just a nit-pick, and he still delivers a fine performance. I also enjoyed Fairuza Balk as Derek's downright creepy girlfriend Stacey.<br/><br/>I must also praise the cinematography, especially for the flash-back scenes with the use of black and white. It adds a certain atmosphere to them, which intensify the emotional weight of the entire movie. The editing could be criticized, since the slow motion sequences are perhaps a bit too common, but all in all, it is only a minor flaw. The score, composed by Anne Dudley, is excellent and some moments are simply breathtaking (such as the choir parts from the piece 'American History X'). It too plays a great part in delivering the great emotion the film has.<br/><br/>To summarize; American History X is a very powerful film, which definitely left me quite shocked. It features spiffing acting, great visuals and a good soundtrack, but it unfortunately suffers from minor flaws. In my opinion, these flaws can be quite easily glossed over however.<br/><br/>80/100"

The film is a very interesting story about the trouble of the American society, which is of course very sad and unfortunately but is an important concern. The film's character, Derek, is a very well constructed character, and at least I can sort of chare his opinion and understand his thoughts through the film, and while his opinion changes, mine does too and I start thinking my self, its a really cool happening, with lack of a better word, and really caught me off guard.<br/><br/>The film is very well done and doesn't have many bad scenes, in my opinion, I think the characters and their personality is fantastically done and acted, they were super realistic. This film has some really tough, powerful,violent scenes which I as a teenager liked, but It also had some emotional and sentimental scenes which I also really liked(like the last event, very good). I feel like both of these elements were very important elements for the film.<br/><br/>So I think this is a very well written and directed film, and I really recommend it. It got allot of wise life advice and really got your thinking with a little eye-opener. This film also is like the group System of A Down, which is one of my favourite bands, they pretty much spread the same message I suppose.

","Where should I begin? This movie is beyond borders. First of all is the portraying of two brothers and their path in finding identity. The oldest brother, Derek, finds home in the local nazi-gang and Danny is soon to follow. This is implied in a very nice way and as a viewer you never really question why.
The second treasure in this movie is everything we learn about group-identity. After watching, you will understand so much better why people join the nazis. The hole movie is very thoughtful by the writers and in my psychology-course we have analysed it in many ways. We have for example talked about why the mother don't argue against the boys behavior and how the nazi-group works as a ""home"".
And then there is all the rest camerawork, acting...down to costume it's all absolutely great. The only reason why I don't give it a ten is that I sometimes think it's a little bit too violent. I understand why the writers have chosen to contain all the terror but why does it need to be so brutal and outspoken?"

That's the part of the movie that annoys. The circle of violence.

","I thought the movie was good and memorable, but I can't really get over two major plot holes, namely the second.<br/><br/>1) Derek initially becomes pissed off at the white prison gang for doing business with Hispanics. This tells us that at that time, he was more ideologically stringent than they were. However, he immediately starts talking with the black laundry guy afterwards, even before being raped. So his initial grievance that led to the rape doesn't make sense.<br/><br/>2) When Derek comes back from prison, Danny is fully immersed in white nationalism, hook, line, and sinker. He's enraged when Derek rejects everyone at the party, but suddenly changes his entire worldview from one conversation afterwards? He just says he's sorry that the rape happened to Derek, and that's that? Now he knows that what he's believed for his entire adolescent life is hateful/wrong? Within an hour, he can completely re-examine his ideology and write a regretful paper about it? Huh? He completely skips the stage of questioning. Just goes from one extreme to moderation by hearing that Derek got raped by pseudo-white nationalists and protected by one black guy from other black guys.<br/><br/>Essentially, I think the character development was just a little rushed.

","Director Tony Kane's American History X not only displays the brutality of racism, but how it effects your family and the conflicts that rise from casual dinner arguments, and how hatred just drags you down and doesn't do anything at all to help you solve your problems. Instead, it just creates more problems. Edward Norton has given one of the best performances of his career. He plays a Neo Nazi Skinnhead who is sentenced to seven years in prison for a horrific act of manslaughter. During his time in the joint, he befriends an inmate who happens to be black. His friendship with the inmate changes his perspective on racism and how wrong it really is. Norton's character Derek, has a little brother named Danny (Edward Furlong) who has always looked up to Derek, starts to head down the same path his older brother once did. Having the scenes of Derek being a Skinnhead, shot in black and white was an absolutely brilliant idea. Because if there is one thing black and white cinematography does now a days is present a dark and depressing tone, which is exactly what you feel when you experience these scenes. Beverly Diangelo delivers a captivating and heartbreaking performance as a widow. It had been awhile since we've seen a performance like this. Diangelo said in an interview ""this was her first take on a dramatic role."" Well let me tell you, not bad for her first take on Drama, not bad at all. American History will perhaps go down in ""History"" as one the most contraversial films ever made, and one of the most brutal, other than that, it's got an honest story, captivating performances, and an extremely emotional ending.

It shows the power of education, that what we pass on to our children can influence their whole lives and even political beliefs. On the other hand it depicts how getting to know people instead of just talking about them can change your mind on how to interact with them. Futhermore, it is also a portrayal of a dysfunctional family, that struggles with death and disease. Unlike other reviewers, I sometimes would have wished for the moral of the film to be a bit more subtle. It is important to stand up loud against xenophobia, but it makes the film a bit easy to attack.

The things got better at the last act but at that time I was wondering why the dialogue wasn't that good most of the movie. It's really baffling because the movie needed badly to have a decent and strong dialogue from its beginning, considering its subject matter. The dialogue often was too on the nose and preachy while it should have served its already gripping story. That also made some scenes in the movie feel so awkward and heavy-handed.<br/><br/>The dialogue isn't the only, or the biggest issue I've with American History X. As I think that everything related to the Neo Nazi gang is completely underdeveloped. All the characters of the members of this gang are one-dimensional characters. They are totally undeveloped and bland, and almost have no depth. Which is a shame because they play a pivotal part in the story. They are part of the main plot, so to speak.<br/><br/>Besides that balancing between two contradictory aspects of the story, Tony Kaye with his mixture of black & white history contrasting with colorful reality is magic to absorb and shows this film up to be what it is. Smoothly moving camera in the scenes in Black and White that are set in the past to convey an unsettling feeling, and bleak and restrained colored scenes to match the dystopian-like present.<br/><br/>American History X also has one of the most shocking endings ever. But its ambiguity is what makes it more dreadful. It's an ending that can make you question the protagonist's fate, and that's more than horrifying!<br/><br/>(8/10)"

","I will get the things I did not like out of the way first. There were a few things I found implausible. I will not give spoilers, but there were a few times you can tell the plot was a bit contrived to fit the authors narrative. It was as if they were willing to sacrifice a bit of realism for a neater story. I also object to the ending, again I will not reveal what happens, but it felt unnecessary. Kind of like overkill. With some slight reshuffling there could have been a more rewarding ending. What they decided on is shocking, but it doesn't really add. With that out of the way I can talk about the good. Taking a serious look at Neo Nazis is a very bold move. The overall message is still that racism is bad, which is hardly original in itself, but I still like how they did it. Instead of making the Nazis ridiculous cartoon villains, they actually gave them a credible perspective. Not that you have to agree with their views, but you can at least see why the characters think the way they do. Actually, if anything some of the liberal characters are at times more cartoonish. Then again that might just be because it is so much more common for liberal political opinions to be in Hollywood movies, so they inevitably seem more cliche. The cast all do a great job, Edward Norton deserves recognition for this, he was able to bring a very complex character to life, and explore some very dark themes. I know this movie was made well before Breaking Bad, but it does remind me of Walter White, in the sense that you may not agree with everything he does, but you cannot stop watching to see what happens next. Overall, this is a very heavy film, you need to be in the right mood for it, but if you are, it is very rewarding. This is a great movie."

","Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) is a neo-Nazi skinhead who gets sent to prison after he brutally murders the black hooligans that try to steal his car. The movie jumps between timelines following his and his younger brother's lives both before, during and after the prison sentence, as Derek learns to question his commitments to the white supremacy cause.<br/><br/>It's a skillful movie, no doubt about it. The non-linear chronology allows us to slowly learn about Derek and see what caused him to change. His younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) also functions as an important character and a message about the cyclic nature of hate. Derek learned to hate from his father and in time taught Danny to hate. Now it's up to him to teach Danny to accept.<br/><br/>The movie is also shot really well. The cinematography is brisk and clean, and the numerous black-n-white scenes give the film a style of its own. The non-linearity is handled well and the story is easy to follow. However, the movie does end a bit abruptly in my mind. And on a note I'm still not quite sure whether I like or not. On the surface it seems to undermine the whole message of the film, but on the other hand you could also see it as a final test. Nevertheless, I do think there could have been a better way to end the film, but I'm sure I'm on the minority in this.<br/><br/>It's still a great film to check out. Personally, if I wanted to recommend a film about a neo-Nazi redeeming himself, I'd go with Dome Karukoski's Heart of a Lion. But that's a much more obscure film."

","Brazilian's synopsis made me have a wrong idea about this film. Based on that, one expects it to be a deeply analysis of a prisoner's life. Sadly, this film is situated in jail for only some few minutes, I believe less than half an hour, which frustrated me. The whole concept is very interesting, a neo-nazi skinhead realizes all the prejudices he believed in are completely junk. I thought Derek (Edward Norton) would become good friends with some black guys and understand they're all the same, but he just shares a laugh or two with one black guy and that's it, no big thing. Also, I found Norton's acting to be kinda weak, specially when he's ""crying"" in the last minutes. He ""cries"" and not a single tear falls from his eyes.<br/><br/>All in all, I believe this is a good concept with a not so rich execution. If you want to see a strong film about prejudice and racism, watch ""A Time To Kill""."

","American History X attempts to do what many would consider unthinkable; to take a vile, disgusting neo-Nazi and portray him into a hero. How exactly does it go about doing that? By showing us his human side. Derek Vinyard's (Ed Norton,)father is killed by a group of black kids. Filled with rage, he becomes prey for Cameron Alexander (Stacey Keach,) leader of the local Aryan Brotherhood. Derek makes a name for himself,and it's not long before he lands himself in the clink. To his own surprise, he befriends an African-American convict (Guy Torry,) who ends up saving his life when Derek's skinhead buddies turn against him. Upon his release, he is disturbed to see his younger brother, Danny (Edward Furlong) following in Big Brother's footsteps.<br/><br/>I first rented this film out of curiosity, thinking it would portray racism in the typical Hollywood, sugar-coated fashion. Oh, how wrong I was. It was easily one of the most brutal films ever. Norton gives an outstanding performance, at once terrifying and yet uncomfortably human. Edward Fulong is also solid as the young, confused Danny. Beverly D'Angelo (as their mother,) Elliot Gould and Avery Brooks as teachers at their school, and Fairuza Balk as Derek's Nazi girlfriend all lend strong support, but, ultimately, it is Norton's show, and he runs with it."

Every time you watch the movie you take the same taste as the first time maybe even better. The first scene starts with a man making love with his girlfriend that makes you shocked at the first minutes but then the story takes you to a terrible prison, neo-nazi people defending the racialism so hardly, a family so close to fall into pieces and so on. The players are chosen very carefully and I think Norton fits to his character very very much.

","American History X stars Edward Norton as a racist, xenophobic skinhead who is convicted of murder and sent to prison. It follows the effect of this on his family, specifically on his younger brother, played by Edward Furlong, who idolizes him and yearns to follow in his footsteps.<br/><br/>The movie is powerful and disturbing in the insider's look it gives us into the dark world of violent racist skinhead groups. For this reason, it is very difficult to watch. But it's an important film, because it tackles a subject that Hollywood is usually content to shy away from.<br/><br/>Edward Norton, always one of my favourite actors, has one of his best roles of all time here. He is absolutely brilliant in his portrayal of Derek Vinyard, a character whose charisma and intelligence could have led him down pretty much any path, but who chose the wrong road. How many infamous men in history have had the exact same qualities? Countless. Norton embraces the role, wholly embodying the most terrible qualities of his character, and refusing to shy away from giving his all to even the most difficult scenes. He has even transformed his entire body to play this part (compare his muscular build here to his scrawniness in ""Fight Club"", for instance). Norton is so believable, and so compelling to watch, that it's all too easy to see how he could have recruited and inspired so many people to his fanatically hateful ideology. Also brilliant is Avery Brooks as the schoolteacher who tries so hard to redeem Derek when most people would have written him off long ago. Notable among smaller roles are performances by Fairuza Balk as Vinyard's girlfriend and Beverly D'Angelo as his conflicted mother. This is a dramatic film, and the acting has made it what it is.<br/><br/>My criticisms are few. Furlong's acting isn't quite as strong - at times it seems like he's reading lines aloud for a teacher. And without giving too much away, the ending comes across as a bit too contrived. At times, the movie skirts dangerously close to after-school-special territory, and it can be a bit heavy-handed in its preachiness. It's not a perfect film, by any means.<br/><br/>But it's a provocative film, one that I urge parents to watch with their teenagers and that is sure to open up a lot of discussion. A must-see."

He younger brother Danny Vinyard (Furlong) saw this, but did not testify, saving his brother from a life sentence. Derek gets out of jail 3 years later when his sentence is up, and finds out that his younger brother is on the same path of destruction. Derek tells Danny about changing his ways, and explains to what happened to him in jail in hopes that Danny does not go to jail either.<br/><br/>This is a very powerful movie that is central theme is about anti-racism. The plot is a fairly generic one, someone telling someone close to them to change their ways so that they do not follow a similar fate.<br/><br/>The acting is well done for all of the characters and you can see the emotion that Edward Norton has the end of the movie. The movie also has a unique way of tell the story. For any evens that have occurs in the past, black and white film is used, and when it's for the present color film is used. <br/><br/>This film is NOT for everyone.

","The narrative.<br/><br/>A passionate emotive tale about racism in society where Norton (Fight Club) is juxtaposed with Furlong (Terminator 2) as brothers who contend with many racial issues in Southern America. The beginning is sensational. The camera comprises a slow moving long shot of a seaside, filmed in black and white to emphasise America's gentleness and emotion. The film continues its brilliance with a disturbing black and white flashback of why Norton ended up in prison and set the agenda to state the purpose of the film, that violence and racism is wrong in every society. The film preaches society values through the characters, especially Norton who is completely against the black stereotypes and wishes to take action to defend himself and his country. His speeches and actions through the film are remarkable and his character is very controversial, to pull this role was sensational and he thoroughly deserved his Oscar nomination for playing a character that is evil, violent and dominant but then sentimental and vulnerable over certain issues. The film is always engaging and extremely powerful. It entices older audiences with powerful moving speeches and violent actions by opinionated characters. Norton and Furlong were both outstanding and deserve praise for playing such emotional characters in this extremely violent film. The ending was remarkable, a shocking tactic by director Kaye who directed this film superbly throughout, but the ending is so powerful I was in tears. It was sensational the way it ended and will leave audiences asking many questions and wondering about their own actions and consequences. Flashbacks were a fantastic technique to emphasise the use of the character's lives and the significance of Norton's change. Always filmed in black and white the flashbacks set emotion and convince audiences of the brutality of the Vinyard lives. <br/><br/>Racism in society. <br/><br/>I'm not accustomed to racism and don't know enough about issues regarding Nazis but I can tell by watching this film that there was and still is something wrong in society. People are entitled to their own opinions about immigrants and other country values but to me it is wrong, there should be equality in the world and this film emphasises how wrong society actually is by encoding hate crimes and a powerful differentiation between different cultural groups. <br/><br/>It is so powerful and meaningful that it simply can't be ignored. <br/><br/>It will take a strong person to cope but it is an essential watch for the powerful racial, parenting, family, school and crime ideologies put forth."

","I don't want to give too much away to reader's who may not have seen the film, so I won't say much...but if I had to use one word to sum up American History X, it would be ""powerful"". This is the kind of film that is missing in the current film environment that is usually based more around flash than substance, ie special effects and a physically attractive cast are commonly used to win over audiences as opposed to a solid plot containing powerful messages that actually might make you think. I saw this movie last night and it is a fascinating insight into the insecurity of young people and their desire to belong to something, to feel accepted. I believe this theme is equally as prevalent as the denunciation of racism throughout the film. Another thing I liked is that the cast is portrayed as being incredibly human... nobody in this film is ""perfect"", as we frequently see in other films. From the protagonist to his young brother to the wise English teacher, they have all had their share of problems in the past, as well as in the present. I think it is a testament to the director and cast that we actually end the film sympathising with a convicted murderer. The moral of the film is that hate is baggage, and we reap what we sew in life. We need to ask ourselves that one question when our lives are veering off course ""Has anything I've done made my life better?"". For the protagonist in American History X, this simple advice is enough to turn around his life from that point on... but it is too late to undo the consequences of his wide-reaching influences, hurting him in the most painful place he ever could have imagined. So once again, this film is sheer power. Certainly it is disturbing in parts, and probably not for young children or the overly sensitive. Nevertheless, it is a fantastic film, truly one of the best of all time. I give it 9 out of 10 stars."

But it has its weaknesses too.<br/><br/>Here are some of the issues: The story pushes a little too hard for the things that happen in the film.<br/><br/>Spoilers follow Having the protagonist bond with the laundry guy was a little too convenient and a little too easy. Not that I don't believe it could happen, but based on the protagonist's character, it's asking a lot for the relationship have so little conflict. Also, the protagonist is supposed to be smart and a rallier of his peers. When he's in prison, he seems to lose his smarts, or they get put under his ""ideals"", which wasn't immediately convincing. His moral dilemma is also a tough sell, because we don't get to spend enough time with him getting confused.<br/><br/>End spoilers In that sense, the film asks the viewers to make some large leaps of faith and I wasn't entirely convinced. The other issue is the ending of the film. The film goes on too long and the end-drama doesn't seem necessary and even goes to the point of being a little over-the-top.

Edward Norton gives the performance of his career as a reformed Neo-Nazi determined to deter his brother, Edward Furlong, from the life he once held.

Sure, I am not a fan of the cliché ""perfect Hollywood ending"". However, this is one film that I felt should not have ended in the most depressing way imaginable. <br/><br/>I have read some comments on IMDb.com about the director having problems with the ending. He even went so far as trying to have his name taken off the credits and replaced with ""Humpty Dumpty"". I must say that I agree with him. Since I know that the younger brother will die in the end it prevents me from watching this movie very often as it is just too depressing. I think a good alternative ending would have Norton's character held back for the rest of his life by his record. He is way too intelligent to enjoy life while having to work as some sort of laborer for the rest of his life. The irony would have been ""an eye for an eye"" as he ruined lives by committing manslaughter and there is nothing worse for an extremely smart person to dig ditches for a living. This is something I can definitely relate to. However, his younger brother often supports him financially in the future as a payback for saving him from a life of ""naziism"". Norton's character is punished for his sins, yet there is some redemption for turning his back on the nazi's which regarded him as a hero. <br/><br/>That is how I would have ended the movie if I was given the script. This alternate ending would be far from your stock ""Hollywood happy ending"", without being so depressing."

","Probably one of the most powerful films I have ever seen, with a subject matter that is so delicate and easily could have been mishandled  this film delivers a performance of a lifetime from Edward Norton and a superb story shaping the influences around him.<br/><br/>The film is told in two tales; one in black and white, conveying the wrongful doings of Derek Vinyard (Norton) and about how his racial crusades slowly infiltrate the mind of his little brother. After a brutal racially motivated murder of three individuals for breaking into his car, Derek is sent to jail where he soon learns the errors of his ways and comes to realise the pain and suffering he has caused.<br/><br/>The second story told in colour, runs parallel to that of the past of Derek. This story focuses more on Danny Vinyard, and about the effect his brother has on him. After handing in a paper on Mein Kampf, the school's headmaster orders Danny to write a paper about his brother. This is where we hear the vocal expressions of the effects that he has had on him through a well delivered voice-over. On the same day when Danny is reunited with his brother, Danny sets about trying to impress his brother by taking up where he left off  the tattoos, the haircut, the attitude  aspiring to him. <br/><br/>But as Derek's story develops from his time in prison, you begin to realise that he cannot let his brother take the same path as he did. He disowns all his friends and connections in the neo-Nazi party in a ditch attempt to save his brother from a similar life of destruction and mayhem. <br/><br/>The relationship between the two brothers is what drives the plot of the film; the acting between them is impeccable and emotionally driven. As Danny finally realises what his brother is trying to teach him, he is shot by a gang member that he encountered before his brother showed him the right path. Derek holding his dead brother in his arms is the greatest lesson of all. Norton conveys with such passion, the pain, the guilt and true regret the character is feeling his brother's death was his entire fault. <br/><br/>Without a doubt one of the most powerful films you will see, and I can't help but feel that under all this there is a powerful message that mankind is twisted and troubled in today's society over such petty issues as race and equality which could so easily be dealt with by the governments in place."

Like Danny did in the film i will end this review with a couple of quotes that i think fit well with this film: 'those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities', 'The world is a dangerous place, not because of those who do evil but because of those who look on and do nothing.' PROMOTE THE PEACE."

","Danny Vinyard, a fervent follower and fan of his older brother, Derek, opens this film's plot with a telling determination for Neo Nazism. After their father's death, Derek translates all this rage into hatred toward minorities, arguing that America was meant for white people and no other race. Due to his impressive will, he is picked up by Cameron to head the local white power movement... where his hate triples. Such is the case that his inner hate leads him to brutally and callously assassin a powerless man... and thus a prison sentence.<br/><br/>Three years later, Danny, now a transformed white supremacist awaits impatiently for his brother's return as he desperately needs his brother's love and guidance for a more unified white power monolith. Little did he know something happened to Derek in that prison that changed his life completely. Derek must now do all that he can in order to save his town from the violence of hatred that he once bestowed upon.<br/><br/>**************************** COMMENTS *********************************<br/><br/>The plot was very well constructed, it was meaningful and representative of our everyday life. This movie was by no means predictable like the other 99% of movies that Hollywood comes out with. For once, it seemed as though the director and the writer of the script put serious thought into this one.<br/><br/>The acting was incredible! I can't stress that enough, especially Edward Norton. I always depicted him to be a weak, nice guy. Not here. He completely surprised me, and in a pleasant way. He depicts the evil side of the human race with a very close resemblance, if not identical. His change from hate to love was also amazing, one which I haven't seen an actor do in a long time. I seriously cannot find any flaws in the cast. Everyone fits their roles perfectly.<br/><br/>If you have not watched this movie, I strongly urge you to watch it, in fact, I beg you to go watch it. This movie does a great job in simultaneously portraying racism in its rawest and most complete form. I must warn, however, that it's a very strong movie, but at the same time represents our modern society perfectly, and it is this latter aspect that makes the film a drop-dead gorgeous masterpiece (I know, it's redundant, but that's how good this movie is). A definite must see!!!"

","Every now and then one of those films comes along and just blows you away. American History X is one of those films.<br/><br/>Set in Venice Beach, in the Neo-Nazi skinhead neighbourhood of LA. You have two brothers Derek (Edward Norton) and Danny Vinyard (Edward Furlong) whose father was killed putting out a fire in a black neighbourhood. Their father's death estranged them into believing everyone none white-protestant is scum. One night after winning a game of basketball, two blacks try to steal Derek's car in the middle of the night, Danny hears and tells his brother, who is the right out there with a gun in his hand. Where he kills one of them, and performs one of the most disturbing deaths in cinematic history to the other. Derek is put away to prison for three years, where he meets Lamont (Guy Torry, who gives an excellent performance) a black laundry worker who gives him a speech that makes him see that his beliefs were wrong. He returns from prison a changed man, but isn't pleased to see that his brother has followed in his footsteps. And is being brainwashed by Seth (The amazing Ethan Suplee) and shady gang leader Cameron Alexander (Stacy Keach). And Derek goes about to stop this.<br/><br/>American History X is a mind blowing assault on the senses and the mind. And gives out a powerful message. Although at times it seems like it is trying too hard to put across that message to the audience. Edward Norton is fantastic as the Neo-Nazi skinhead, and in my opinion should have got the Oscar at the Academy Awards. Also lookout for Ethan Suplee his performance as Obese, racist, basketball player is a very different role from the slow-witted Randy in My Name Is Earl, and is also outstanding.<br/><br/>The films message is that racial prejudice is pointless and life is too short to hate people because of their skin colour, my hope and most probably the writers hope is that this message got through to some people.<br/><br/>9/10 Magnificent film, only thing that lets it down slightly is that it tries to hard to touch upon it's basis, but apart from that: Incredible, definitely worth a watch. (Maybe even a few watches)."

","Quite possibly the best movie I have ever seen. This movie not only has an amazing story, but the artistic value is tremendous. The stark contrast between the black and white scenes versus the color adds so much to the film. I can't remember another movie that I've seen that impressed me so much artistically.<br/><br/>Norton embodies his character so well, as does Furlong. They go beyond characters on a screen to create a relationship between them and the viewer. By the end of the movie it's as if you've known them and been a part of their struggle.<br/><br/>If you've not seen this movie, you should make it a priority."

","At the start of this film, I didn't know what to make of it. I found the music quite irritating, but I think thats just my opinion, I just prefer things to be less obvious , so I don't like too much music trying to explain situations for me, but once I had adjusted, I really did enjoy this film. <br/><br/>Edward Norton gives a very good, believable performance, and the rest of the acting is also very good- there are moments when you can look into the actors' eyes and see the characters' madness, their fear, their sorrow, but don't be put off by this- it is morbid, but it isn't completely depressing. It makes some very good points and has some very strong scenes. The timing is also often perfect, with perfect reactions from the actors' which makes the chaos seem realistic. It's also not too predictable which is good, and the way it is set out allows it to be cleverly unravelled<br/><br/>Very good, I recommend it."
"thesteve86","8","0","0","9 May 2006"," what is the film trying to say??
","I have just finished watching this film for the 3rd time and it still shocks me. Without doubt it is one of the most controversial films ever to be produced.<br/><br/>The first thing that strikes me as a viewer is the direction and cinematography which is apparent from the opening scenes. ALthough it is clichÃ© to say that black and white is 'powerful' i believe it is the lighting in these scenes that make it so. The shadowy look of the room Derek and Stacy are in highlights the darkness surrounding the period of time that the scene takes place. Throughout the film the cut scenes, flash backs and numerous slow-mo close ups are seamlessly directed and provide the intensity needed for a film based on such an important and rage-filled subject.<br/><br/>The subject is something that the viewer will be aware of before watching the film but when it is explored by Tony Kaye, this is where is enthrals me. This could so easily have been a mediocre film about race without the intelligence shown in the script. For instance the argument between Derek and Murray and more specifically Dereks speech at the dinner table brings to light the political awareness of David McKenna. This way of at least showing that some of the base views shrouded by racism are actually logical is something that makes the film engrossing.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most engrossing factor of the film is the plot and characterisation. The 'bad boy turned good' plot is initially not particularly original but the way Edward Norton and Edward Furlong portray this is fantastic. How Norton captures the emotions of a man in turmoil is exceptional and will always be one of the most memorable performances i have witnessed in film.<br/><br/>American History X has been widely critically acclaimed and so it should be. It is brilliantly directed and expertly written so much so that a person who watches this film will not only be shocked but absorbed into the political aspects of it."

","American History X shows an excellent transition from hate to understanding through friendship and family ties. As a teacher in a treatment facility I see these types of behaviors daily. My job is to help the residents keep up with school as long as they are in the facility for treatment. Whether they are in for emotional issues or chemical dependency issues, they all have behaviors that they feel are necessary for survival. Ed's character - Derek - undergoes a life altering behavior/attitude change that is surprising as well as believable. The writing and acting teams did an exceptional job portraying the changes necessary to make the movie complete and memorable. This is a movie that I will buy."
"alex_rosenfield","10","0","0","5 May 2006"," An excellent & moving film
","Of all the thought provoking and absorbing movies I've seen, American History X is placed right at the top. A superb plot combined with magnificent acting makes this one of the all time greats. From the films opening scenes to its gripping, knife-edge conclusion, the film powefully portrays one man's struggle to assimilate back into society after serving a prison sentence for race related crimes. The film weaves ingeniously between the flashbacks and the present state of Edward Norton's character, Derek Vinyard, a one time neo-Nazi, who's violent hatred of America's multi-cultural society culminates in the brutal murder of two men. Derek's imprisonment proves to be a life-changing experience, as upon his release he appears to his adoring family and friends as a reformed man, who's appearance, beliefs & ideology have drastically changed. With a clean slate, Derek now faces the gruelling challenge of rescuing his brother from following the same doomed path which resulted in his own incarceration. I was genuinely absorbed with this film from start to finish and although fictional, I felt it fully demonstrated the dangers and damaging consequences of racism. Norton's tremendous acting complements a clever storyline, which still leaves me in suspense every time."

","I've seen a lot of Ed Norton's films and he's one of my list of actors whose films I'd watch initially without bothering to read who thought what of it etc. He was completely scary in this film great acting but scary! I do wonder why he didn't get an Oscar or nomination for this rather than Primal Fear. He was good in Primal Fear but much better in X. It was a little like seeing Sean Penn in Dead Man Walking, totally convincing performance. Also made me think how frightening it is when you are faced with those who are so narrow minded as were a lot his friends in the film, and proof of how much peer pressure is a strong influence on not just the young but on us all."

","When i started to watch this movie I thought is was just be another crappy documentary about the Neo-Nazis and their uprising. I have seen a lot of them on the History Channel and they all suck! But as I watched the movie further and further I realized it was more emotional than I first perceived. The movie gave you true to life scenes of what it is to be a modern white Skinhead. All the parts were played perfectly, Edward Nortons' acting is superb. He plays the role so strongly that sometimes you believe that he REALLY is a Nazi (althought he is not). The drama in this movie is so realistic and very violent too. For example there is a scene is this movie where Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) is in prison and gets raped by his fellow Skinheads because Derek believed they did not convey the views of the Aryan (Neo-Nazi) brotherhood like they were supposed to. Furthermore, after he is raped, one of his old history teacher in high school talks to him about his brother Daniel Vinyard (Edward Furlong: T2 actor). Daniel is Derek's older brother and he is killed at the end of the movie because he was a skinhead. Overall this movie is so true to life that it seems like a documentary but it is a movie. A must watch. ( NOT FOR THE KIDS THOUGH!!!)"

","The movie definitely brought a new perspective of society to my knowledge. Before seeing this movie a couple of years ago, I wasn't aware that there were skinheads in modern day. Even though the movie is quite controversial, it brings out a moral which everyone should respect. I love how the movie defined society and the influence of a person's environment, family, and upbringing. American History X was an excellent movie and it is also a great movie to tell others about. There are plenty of uneducated people out there that need to understand how their actions may be wrong. I think that this movie should be taught in school, or at least segments of it. It is a great movie and it will definitely pertain to modern society in 5, 10, 20 years because these issues still haven't stopped.

It is just one of those movies , which , after you've seen them , make you feel you're a new man:trying to think and question the inertia of social behavior and the cruel attitude people have towards some of their somehow different peers, let's say of different race or religion. Trying to be myself more open , twice thinking of the facts i hear about and the real value of the man next to me - this is the effect this good film had upon me.

The black and white lets you know that they are reflecting on things in the past, but also is metaphorical for a time when Ed Norton looked at everything as either black or white and the color parts reflect the times where he had changed and saw everyone as the same color. It is a very well directed movie and should be considered at a top 10 of all time."

","OK. I got this movie out from the library, and was watching it and feel asleep just after the black guys got killed and the film changed to color. It just looked like another one of those crazy American youth type films. I saw the comments on this site, however, and thought I'd better have another look as I still had it out.<br/><br/>On watching it a second (first?) time, I overlooked the lecturing (American style) and bad language, and got through to the end. I also found out why the color was being switched on and off. The here and now was in color and the past events in black and white. <br/><br/>The film actually got better as it went on. It has an important message of forgiving your enemies and that race hatred doesn't pay. It is also best to get along with everyone if possible, and not try to annoy others.<br/><br/>The film also acts as a sort of documentary of American city life, and the problems that young people have. I guess that racism is alive and well in most places.<br/><br/>Unfortunately things don't turn out as expected, but they never do in real life anyway. I think it is a good film for people to watch, but it may have limited appeal for women due to the extreme violence, continual shouting, and bad language.

","American History X is a story of two brothers - Derek and Danny Vinyard (Edwards Norton and Furlong) - who believe in White Power, and they belong to a Neo-Nazi movement where people think if you are not ""white protestant"", you're not worth anything. When three black guys try to steal Derek's car, Derek freaks out and kills two of the thieves and goes to jail where he is forced to see the other side of things. ""In here, you the nigga. Not me"" tells Derek's working partner in the prison.<br/><br/>American History X is probably the most powerful movie I've ever seen. The way two stories - current day in colour and past events in black&white - are told in a parallel way is very beautiful, implicating how things in the past were so simple, so black and white, whereas in reality they are much more complex. <br/><br/>The story is very strong and wakes up strong feelings in the viewer, but towards the end gives also hope and vision of a brighter future. As the little brother Danny puts it: ""Hate is a baggage. Life's too short to be p****d off all the time. It's not worth it"".<br/><br/>Edward Norton got Oscar -nominated for his role as the skinhead Derek Vinyard. And I don't question that nomination a bit! He is just awesome as first the hateful, self confident skinhead, then confused and sad man, questioning things and in the latter part a strong father figure for his little brother. The growth story of Derek is brilliantly made, a very powerful role for Norton who delivers his performance flawlessly. It is also amazing to see the transformation of otherwise a bit skinny baby-faced Norton to this muscular, tough guy skinhead.<br/><br/>Edward Furlong as little brother Danny plays a beautiful role as well. Grown up in the shadow of his brother he is the sweet big-eyed little brother everyone wants to protect. Furlong fits into his role 100%.<br/><br/>American History X jumped directly to the top 10 of my all time favourite movies.

","Americam History X,is a very good movie. I saw it when it first came out in the theaters, and I was directly changed on some of my point of views, that I had before the movie. Edward Norton, which gained about 30 pounds of muscle for this movie was astonishingly, with his roll and how he played it. Edward Furlong also played a good role. Here is a review of the movie. The story follows an intelligent young man named Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) and his decline into the world of disillusion and hate known as White Supremacy. Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) buffed up to 190 pounds, with a shaved head, swastika tattoo, biker goatee and a feral, angry gaze, he is one scary image. Once a thoughtful and easy-going teen, he soon begins his change when his casually racist firefighter father is killed while trying to put out a fire in a black neighborhood. Falling under the wind of a neo-Nazi (Stacy Keach), Derek becomes a recruiting agent for local white kids. While the local movement grows, Derek gets deeper and deeper in, polluted more and more by hate. This all comes together when Derek kills two black gang members who tried to steal his truck. He is caught and sent to jail, where he is shown the error of his ways. The hard way. With the help of one of his former teachers (Avery Brooks), Derek begins to reform. However, it may be too little too late. While Derek was in prison, his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) is starting to head down the same path. Now, aside from trying to leave the world he created he has to save his little brother from it too. I had do to a movie review for my English class so I watched the movie again, and I was not nearly as pleased as the first time. The movie seemed kind of all fake and so played out. You knew what was going to happen next. So I guess if I was you I would only see it once, and I would definitely not buy the DVD unless you collect movies, because this would be a very good movie to add to your collection."

Edward Norton does an amazing job as Derick. The music choice is perfect. The camera angles are original. I recommend it to everyone, young and old. The director portrays the issue of neo-nazi's and rasism from the white supremist's point of view. By the end of the movie you are sympathizing with Derick and his brother Danny, despite what they have done to blacks and other minorities. It shows how rasism starts and how usually starts at home. Parents have a huge influence on how their kids view the world, and the director acknowleges this. What I also like about this movie is that it shows how people can change, but sometimes it is too late."

Perhaps it was the controversy surrounding this film that caused it to be silenced in the media, I only got to watch it because of ""chance"" (luckily I heard it from a website). Anyways, it's about a man named Derek whose life is presented out in pieces throughout the film on his Neo-Nazi beliefs, and the progression of his recovery in prison to discover his beliefs and anger have only destroyed him throughout the years. He then must prevent his brother Daniel from pursuing the same path. This movie is beyond words. It is definitely in the Top 10 movies I have ever seen.

","This movie is directly related to Spike Lee's ""Malcolm X,"" where both characters experience the metamorphoses of: 1) Self-hate 2) Extreme hate of viewed opponents and oppressors 3) A balance and realization<br/><br/>I've learned a lot from these two movies. They speak directly of the balance that exists everywhere, which is inevitable and everlasting. Balance always exists, but the process by which it is achieved can be drastic and violent sometimes. (Derek kills two black men; later, his brother is killed by a black teenager.) So, extremity can sometimes be the only way to go about solving things, but it ultimately needs to balanced out with logic. White supremacy in slavery leads to black supremacy in the civil rights movement, which leads to white supremacy immediately after. I used to think it was weak to be balanced in my viewpoints of the world. While it is okay to be angry and believe things are unfair, finding balance is the ultimate outcome. Well, either you find balance for yourself, or balance finds you, and sometimes it isn't the most pleasurable lesson.<br/><br/>After birth comes death, and from death comes birth."

","Downgraded from an 11 out of 10 because of the graphic violence; however, the real reason for the excellent review is that without the violence, the story would have been worth an 11 out of 10. Having seen this movie the viewer will see bigotry portrayed as naked discrimination and the deceitful mask of warmongers mimicking great peaceful demonstrators hiding the excuses for war in other leaders successes. This warns that seeking the same fame without the same determination and honor makes for the revelation of false motives. This movie is a landmark in the industry. A must see for those who believe that they have to hate someone. Neo-Nazi skin-heads are seen by the parents of the neighborhoods and find themselves reacting to the anger of a suppressed nation of black youths. They seek solace in the act of forming their own gangs, believing that there is safety in numbers. The story unfolds to tell a very rich story that makes people realize why there was such an attraction to hating another people for the lie of unifying themselves for a common cause, finding themselves divided."

Although the movie is brutal and very graphic, It goes along with the plot unlike some slasher movie just about gore. There is a reason to the violence and it shows during the course of the movie. This movie is not for the easily offended but I would recommend it to anyone that appreciates good cinema and enjoys films that make you think."

","American History X is THE best film I have ever seen in my life. The film is completely breathtaking with two immense performances. Edward Nortons spell bounding performance receives so much praise and admiration that I think Ed Furlongs performance is overshadowed. This is a complete shame as Furlong as absolutely spectacular in the role of Danny and portrays the ""young, angry white boy"" superbly. The film has no rest bite whatsoever and continuously amazes throughout. With most films there is a peak that you reach mid way through and then you can look away and breathe, but American History X permanently shocks and steals your breath. It is truly brilliant and Tony Kaye has definitely never directed a film as good as this, and he is extremely unlikely to. If you haven't seen it shame on you. If you have and you aren't in love with it shame on you too. WAY WAY WAY BETTER than the Godfather, Pulp Fiction, Lord Of The Rings and anything else you can show me."

","Jesus, that was a wonderful film.From beginning to end,this movie is a wild mechanical bull ride.It begins sadly, and it ends yet worse. It was really an emotional roller-coaster, at least it should be if you have empathy towards other human beings.It is beautifully directed, i enjoyed the way in which the screen would turn black and white during flash backs, Edward Norton looked more impressive that way, and in slow motion.I am not a Neo Nazi or Skin Head, but that tattoo which Norton's character bore on his chest was simply amazing. He was a sort of Fuhrer, for the twenty-first century, somebody who we could relate to better than we could Hitler, as gangs in the slums are something which is common today, and quite out of control.<br/><br/>Tony Kaye was an amazing director in this film, he delivered it quite realistically, and it was hard not to be touched by such a dramatic series of unfortunate events. This is not to mention Edward Norton's acting, which was even better than on the set of Fight Club. If you have failed to see this movie yet, and you are a big movie fan, then you are wasting your time by reading this. See it my friend...witness the beauty American History X."

","To me this powerful film shows Ed Norton as one of our most impressive and gifted actors of a generation. His excellent portrayal of Derek, a brutal Nazi loving thug who through his life changing experiences in prison slowly realises the error of his ways. Supported by a fine performance by Edward Furlong who plays his idolising, yet astute younger brother Danny the film rolls a emotional ride of hate for black, Jewish, Asian, if fact anyone who does not fit with Derek's view of a normal American to the love for his brother and other members of his family. Extremely violent scenes in the film are not only justified to establish the utter ruthlessness of Derek but probably a true reflection of how these people live and think."

","Derek was a crazy racist before he was sent into the prison. His action also affected greatly his younger brother Danny. Even Danny took him as his model. But Derek got the most important lesson for him in the prison. After leaving the prison, he was not a racist anymore. Although he tried to persuade Danny to abandon racial discrimination, Danny was still killed by his black classmate.<br/><br/>At present racial discrimination not only happens in America, it is also a headache for other countries. As advanced animal, the human being cannot live in harmony. That absolutely is shameful for the mankind. We have to learn much from the natural world. People are born to be equal, but we cannot respect each other.

","American History X is one of the most important films of are generation which tells us about the true horrors of racial prejudice(from both white and black citizens) that still goes on in our world today. <br/><br/>In the state of California a young Neo-Nazi skinhead called Derek Vinyard(Edward Norton) is arrested and jailed for the violent killings of two coloured men who were trying to steal his van. Then while serving his sentence Vinyard slowly begins to realise just how wrong he was to do all the savage things he did. Derek vows that on the day of his realise he shall be a reformed man and is determined to save his younger brother Danny(Edward Furlong) from adopting to the same life style he had once lead due to the fact that he has already fallen under the influence of Cameron Alexander the older man who had convinced Derek to set up the white power movement that he use to lead, while destroying shops in their area which were owned by foreign businessmen. The story is very well written and makes it easy to understand all the characters. The ending is a bit of a shocker but still powerful as it remains us that every racial group on this earth can be racist not just the while people. <br/><br/>Edward Norton's acting as Derek Vinyard in this movie was legendary and easily his best performance so far, passing Fight Club by miles in my opinion. I here he was up for an occur back in 1998 for his role in American History X and was only denied it due to all the controversial scenes in the movie, which I fell was a real shame as he really deserved it much more that anyone else that year. <br/><br/>Edward Furlong is also excellent in his role as Danny Vinyard and was a really good narrator throughout the film. The rest of the cast which included Avery Brooks, Ethan Suplee, Fairuza Balk and Stacy Keach are also terrific.<br/><br/>This movie is one of the best and most powerful pieces of acting I've ever seen in my life and I'm actually quite surprised its only ranked at number 60 instead of in the IMDb top 20, but oh well I guess popularity polls can never be the exact why you would wish them to be. Anyway this movie has lots of important lessons to teach its viewer and I would suggest everyone to watch it. I overall give American History X a definite 10/10 stars."
"KSqueaker","10","0","0","14 August 2005"," The best movie I've seen in a while
","American History X is a very important movie. It delivers its point (the effects and seeds of racism in middle-class America) unabashedly. At points the film is grotesque (I won't say what, but I was trying to tell a friend about one scene and I couldn't even say it, it was so disturbing!!!) and sickening. Even just the mindset of Derek (played MASTERFULLY by Edward Norton) at certain points in the movie was horrifying. However, racism itself is a horrifying, electric issue that should not be handled lightly. A movie to compare American History X with is Crash, which tackles the issue of racism, but with a lot less subtlety and sincerity. And though it bears an R rating, the film feels so restrained, like the actors made it just to have something activist-ish on their resumes. American History X, however, shies away from no subject, and in its honesty delivers an uplifting message and a dire warning. The script and cinematography are excellent, but what stands out most is Edward Norton's performance. He is my favorite actor (and I don't take that title lightly), and gives a good reason why in American History X. Such complex, wildly different emotions (his apparent satisfaction killing some black men who were attempting to steal his car, his turnaround, guilt, and utterly moving explosion of grief at the end!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Overall, an incredible movie."

","I have seen American History X several times and now own the DVD. This is a superb film, with focus on Edward Norton's character, ""Derek Vineyard."" Derek is a neo-Nazi growing up in Venice Beach, CA. The film is very moving and a realistic account of race relations in Southern California, and also of the inner workings of prison life. The ending of the film was a bit sad, and was probably the weakest part of the film, in my opinion. The film moves along superbly, however, after Derek is released from Prison, he is a changed person, and in my opinion, I'm not so sure he would have done a complete 180 like that, however, it makes sense for the films sake.

","""Has anything you've done made your life better?"" Keep that one little question in your mind because it's the basis of this entire film. Look, everyone looks at skinheads, kkk members, and other miscellaneous hate organizations as mindless hateful machines. We give them no credit, we say there is no basis for their beliefs. Which isn't necessarily true, a lot of it has to do with how these people chose to act upon these feelings. That's what this film focuses upon it gives you more. More to work with, more to work off of, and that's what makes this film more than ""good"". This guy, hateful as he is, is human, with family with heart, and beliefs, and inner demons and choice and we see that. All of it. We start to understand him, we start to see little bits of ourselves in him (we may not want to admit it but we do) we start to watch him and analyze him. This ""guy"" is Derek, yeah, he has a name and this movie it chronicles his past and present. It goes from, intelligent to brainwashed to hateful to prison to changed (mind you, he never loses the intelligence, it just becomes masked by hate). Amazingly dynamic transformations. Yet, he has to watch his brother, Danny, go down the same dingy self-corruptive path. This is what the movie focuses on, and as you watch you grit your teeth and you soak it all up. Because you know in reality, everyone's a little bit racist. Everyone is ""capeable"" of attaining such a status. David McKenna wrote this magnificently, and Tony Kaye captured his writings with great artistic vision and skill. He didn't overplay it, he didn't water it down... much ;) He captured this film and delivered it with such amazing power and grace. Along with an absolutely brilliant cast Edward Norton as Derek and Edward Furlong as Danny, not to mention the small but powerful roles played by Beverly D'Angelo (their mother-Doris) and Avery Brooks playing the ""I won't give up on you"" history teacher Dr. Sweeny. This film is powerful, by all means. It does more than any over the top Oliver Stone flick, because it truly captures the essence and the moment. Because that's what it's all about. Right? Before we judge them we need to understand them, and change accordingly, and fight like mad to hold on to the things we treasure and consider dear. Remember that. If i told you more than the basics (which i kinda did) the movie, in my opinion, wouldn't be as much. All I can say is; I'd definitely recommend it, artistically, as well as content wise. Because it teaches you something, and leaves hope in the minds of the frightened, but most of all because at the end of the day its more than ""good""."

But times are different now. Maybe America wasn't meant to be the way it is now; maybe the framers of this nation had in mind a different vision of what a free land should've been. But, then again, if history has taught us one thing, it is that we can not change history. We can change our destiny. We can change the present if we set our minds to it. But we gotta act.

","I saw this movie for the first time in 1999 and was simply amazed. It's probably the one movie I've seen in my life that's still tattooed on my brain. Reason for this you ask? *SPOILER* The scene at the kerb outside Derek(Edward Norton) Vinyards house. Oh My God!!! I will never forget that scene in my life! OK, it's not the most violent scene in a movie but it certainly is one of the most realistic and brutal. Anywaaays, other than that *END OF SPOILER* this movie is amazingly well done. The characters were all played brilliantly (noteably Nortons) and the scenes work well from colour(present day) to black and white(past)in a Tarantino kind of way.**SPOILER AGAIN** We have Derek Vinyard, a guy torn by the death of his father Dennis (William Russ)who was shot by some black kids as he was working as a fireman. Before this happened, Derek was a superb student who was very interested in cultural studies until he told his father at the breakfast table that his teacher, Dr Sweeney (Avery Brooks) was teaching Affirmative Action in his studies. This is where you learn how Dereks mind is changed in terms of race as his father tells a story of a black man succeeding to get work before a white man, who was more qualified, in getting a job in the fire department where he worked due to said Affirmative Action. As his younger brother Danny(Edward Furlong) looks on at their conversation you can see how he also becomes caught up in their racial views. From this conversation and the circumstances of the two boys' fathers death they become caught up in a web of racial gang fights, causing carnage to anyone who isn't white American. These rampages become more and more heated until 3 black guys go to Dereks house and try to break into his fathers truck. Danny hears this happening and informs Derek who rushes downstairs from his bedroom to greet the youths with a loaded gun. As two get away he grabs the one remaining(after shooting him in the leg) and tells him to ""put your f***ing head on the kerb"".This is the scene I was referring to earlier and will inevitably shock even the most hard-core movie goer. After Derek kills the black guy he is sent to prison (for six years as his brother didn't testify against him) where his views on racism are changed again. I must stop here as I will give the movie away lol. To Put it in short, this is a must see for everyone (over 18, that kerb scene ooooh) as it deals with racism in a very intelligent way and is superbly directed, riveting and well cast. One of my favourite movies of all time 10 1/2 out of 10. P.s. watch out for the scene with Elliot Gould and Edward Norton conversing at the table."
"sublime501","8","0","0","25 July 2004"," Amazing, upon first glance.
","AMERICAN HISTORY X is the powerful story of a proud skinhead named Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton), who gets sent to jail for 3+ years after murdering a couple of young black men who invade his property. When he gets out, a reformed man, he finds that his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) is following in his old footsteps--and even turned in a school paper entitled, ""My Mein Kampf."" Danny's school principal, Dr. Sweeney (Avery Brooks), tells him to rewrite this paper and instead focus it on his own brother. After Derek attempts to flee from his old skinhead gang, and embarrasses Danny in the process, he tells Danny of the story that led him into jail, and what happened once he was there... which Danny then puts into his paper, in the process known as passing it on.<br/><br/>AMERICAN HISTORY X is one of those movies that, upon first glance, is really amazing; but upon repeated viewings, it becomes easier and easier to notice its glaring flaws. The main flaw here is the script. It is awfully written, although there are several humorous moments and also several powerful ones (probably due to great acting and direction, though). Truly, the only interesting parts of the movie are the ones telling of Derek's past (filmed in black and white for an interesting contrast)--the current events, filmed in color, are rather boring and are most specifically when the terrible script shines through. And, though it's a pretty unrealistic movie for the most part, it's made up for.<br/><br/>Then there are the aspects of the movie that you can't really win or lose with. The acting is the most obvious of this category. Edward Norton is GREAT in his starring role (and, kind of oddly considering he plays a skinhead jerk for most of the movie, very attractive), and really holds the movie together. Edward Furlong is also great, though he receives the brunt of the bad lines in my opinion. Among the supporting cast, Fairuza Balk is good as Derek's girlfriend Stacey; Ethan Suplee is good as Derek and Danny's friend Seth; Jennifer Lien is great as Derek and Danny's sister Davina; and Guy Torry is also great as Derek's fellow inmate Lamont. However, the rest of the cast is pretty bad. Beverly D'Angelo stands out in particular as Derek and Danny's mother Doris, as does Avery Brooks as Dr. Sweeney. The former is very melodramatic and has awful delivery, while the latter is completely monotonous and expressionless. Elliott Gould (as the mother's boyfriend Murray) has bad vocal delivery, but he also appears in one of the most heart-breaking scenes in the film.<br/><br/>There are some very good and powerful moments, though, which can all be credited to Edward Norton's marvelous acting. The dinner scene is very sad and unnerving, while the smiley/arrest scene is almost unbearable to watch because it's so horrific and well-done. Even the second time that I watched the film, and I knew what was coming, I found myself cringing when Derek orders the burglar to put his mouth on the curb. The prison scenes are pretty unnecessary and badly carried out, however. And the ending totally shocked me--I could feel my jaw drop and stay there until the credits rolled.<br/><br/>After first viewing, I was ready to give AMERICAN HISTORY X a 9. After my second viewing, though, I was less impressed (maybe because I wasn't so shocked and amazed by the disturbing and distressing ending), and was ready to give it only a 7. The average of those two: 8/10."

","This film is easily the best performance of Ed Norton's great career thusfar. He shows his blue collar side that will work hard to perfect himself for any role. <br/><br/>The problem here is that the rest of the film lags behind his talent. He has little help from the supporting cast, a poor director, and a very soft script in some areas. My biggest problem with the film is that the story was told with flashbacks. We miss out on a great opportunity to grow and change with Derek. The prison scenes are all but pointless, since we already know he comes out reformed and non-violent. Why should we bother watching the middle of the movie? I would have liked this movie a lot more if it was done in linear fashion. <br/><br/>The movie also builds itself on shockingly violent and strong scenes. These are done very well (the rape, the curb incident, the rant by Derek on the news after his father is killed, etc.) However, when we aren't watching one of these scenes, the movie doesn't have much to offer.<br/><br/>The only member of the cast who does well in her role besides Norton is Beverly D'Angelo as the troubled mom. The Nazi influences in Derek and Danny's lives are all clichÃ©d characters that add nothing to the film (Ethan Suplee, Faruiza Balk, Stacey Keach). Ed Furlong didn't sell me on his character being a potentially violent skinhead. Also the attempts at building up the fraternal bond between Derek and Danny failed. It seemed like Norton was carrying Furlong through the whole scene at the diner. <br/><br/>Overall i still gave the movie an 8. It seems like I've bashed it here, but Norton was good enough to wow me, and part of me thinks we had no more character development BECAUSE the director wanted Norton to carry the movie.<br/><br/>Not a bad idea in the least.

","American History X is the story of a man who succumbed to hatred and his journey to redemption. Edward Norton gives the performance of his career as Derek Vinyard, a skinhead jailed for murdering two black men. When he is released from jail he tries to get away from his old life and help his brother, played by Edward Furlong, to understand what happened to him. The film covers racism from nearly every angle and really makes you think. The narrative structure is a bit twisted though, and a lot of it is just flashbacks explaining how Derek came to be a skinhead, what happened to him in jail, etc. It's interesting to see how his hatred tears apart his family and hurts those around him. The ending is like a punch to the gut, but it really sums up what the characters have learned and the consequences of their actions. Totally brilliant, required viewing. 10/10"
"dom-taylor","8","0","0","27 May 2004"," An excellent, and visual portrayal of consequences of racism.
","The movie, of which is probably Ed Norton's best is extremely harrowing, and moving, with a lot of very harsh dialogue. Although enhances an excellent story, plus to add to it, a film in which has only very occasionally been done before, director Tony Kaye has created a master piece, which sets an extremely good example of what may happen to racist people. Having said that, the black and white scenes are unnecessary. Spielberg created 'Schindler's list' in black and white in 1993, and this worked beautifully, setting the field of a dark chapter in human history. This film is completely different, and should always be in colour, sticking with Norton's different hair styles to embark in different sessions in the character's life!<br/><br/>Overall rating: 8.5/10"

","The film tries to deal with social issues as racism. It tells the story of a Nazi men whose convictions change radically after killing three black gang members. After this, the main character is imprisoned and, it will be in prison, where he will abandon his ideology gradually. When he goes out,he also has to try to save his brother from making the same mistakes he made. Its sincerity is worn on its sleeve, and its characters, actions, and ideas compel us to look further and become involved.Its scenes of brutality and violence are downright shocking at times. But it is a film that does have something to say and does so quite clearly: that hate is a virus that affects us all, a virus that is equally as destructive as any known disease out there. The film is also smart enough not to offer a clear cut answer. It instead leaves that for the viewer to ponder and figure out for themselves."

One of them is when Edward grabs the African-American guy, puts his mouth in the sidewalk, and just steps on him really hard on the back of his head and leaves him there. But the cops come, but still very disturbing. The other brutal scene when Edward was in the shower and all those guys rape him for a stupid reason, talking to a African-American guy, what a reason. How they rape him is so crucial, it was uncalled for, but the nudity scene in the bathroom was really funny, I wonder how much they got paid to show their penis. The other disturbing scene was when Edward's little brother got shot in the bathroom, that was so sad and crucial. I am sure it was unexpected by everyone who saw this movie, well for me it was. <br/><br/>There's many more scenes but those are some. The guy he works with the towels in jail was hilarious, he was the only guy i actually thought he was the nicest. <br/><br/>The movie was outstanding and shows a life of hate and racism. The movie is powerful and Edward Norton surely deserved that Oscar nomination good for him. But the only scene that messed him up was the end, when he was crying.

Indeed this film is not for the faint hearted, who will turn away at the first sign of obscenity. Nor is it for the narrow-minded ones amongst us, who will never appreciate the greatness this film has to offer. ""Hate is baggage"", arguably the most meaningful message brought to us in this film through the outstanding performances of Edward Norton (Derek Vineyard)and Edward Furlong (his brother- Danny). Danny is a young but intellectual English student at high school but also an apprentice of the local racist leader Cameron Alexander (Stacey Keach). Derek, a major figure in the ""White Power"" movement is the murderer of two black would-be robbers and the influential role model of his baby brother. The plot begins to unfold when Derek is released from prison after serving his time. Apparently transformed whilst inside, on his release he is devastated to learn that Danny has adopted his brothers wicked neo-Nazi ways. It is now Derek's duty as the older brother to alter the strong and narrow opinions that Danny has before something drastic is allowed to happen. The brutality, language, sexuality and heavy cultural influence are all appropriate if not necessary in bringing across the overall message of this film as one of positive redemption.<br/><br/>A truly marvellous experience, two thumbs up!"

","I choose to view this film not as a flawed masterpiece, but just a story told in hyper realism.  Everything that ever happens in the movie, ever, has a realistic effect, but not to the cause that should have triggered it. This helps you in several areas if you think about it this way.  Like how Derek goes to prison and comes out reformed.  He could have came out reformed but not by going through what his character went through.  It helps you because it speeds up time.  He needs to Learn hate, goto jail for 3 years, unlearn hate and help his brother. thats alot of ground to cover realisticly so we see this hyper reality.  More examples of cause and effects that don't match are.  What turns Derek racists, he could have turned racist, but not like that.  Theres are less potent effects also but they escape me at the moment as i am pressed for time.  Also because the causes don't match the effects you can see more clearly that his racism is all lies. I read once that someone thought this movie was great because you can actually believe some of Dereks rhetoric.  Well some of it is true but thats not what makes this a great movie.  Those white people with that sort of agenda of rage could find real reasons to hate people. That doesn't fix anything though.  I don't watch the movie politically though. I am from a town that is believed by everyone to be racist but really isnt any worse than any other city.  I love this movie for all its raw acting and good cinematography, and of course its use of black and white when derek can only see black and white, i think that is just brilliant.  I think that was a very active choice the director made and it did it right because if we would have gone to color the very second derek saw the light that would have been beating it over everybody's head and campy, but he just played out the rest of that scene in black and white and its brilliant. Great job Tony Kaye, I hope he understands how stupid this movie would seem if it was directed by ""Humpty Dumpty"""

","This is by far the best movie ever made on racism and controversy. The reasons are pretty simple. The essentials are met - i.e. great cast, great acting, great directing etc. but more importantly, is the way the film dealt with the issue it explores and its opinions of it. At first it disects all the dynamic and sensitive emotions and reactions of a typical western/white race who's population is becoming increasingly racially integrated. This in itself is something people have wanted to put into film without it becoming more of a documentary. This film does that brilliantly. By the end, we have a very clever appreciation of why this happens and why racism is a failure of society. It is something that we deal with every day and that we all have an opinion on. This compromises most of those and seems to conclude with something every one can sympathize with - that it is a virtually uncontrollable situation, and that fear and confusion is the driving force behind it from all corners of the globe.<br/><br/>It is certainly a film that I could watch over and over, and enjoy it more every time. It is leagues ahead of all films in its area and is certainly one of the best i have personally ever seen. As for people saying it changes from black-and-white to colour too much - that is because the black-and-white is set in the past. The colour is set in the present. Quite clever really.

","Violence in films is not always a bad thing. Tastefully done, it can add to the effect of a movie, whilst overdoing it can lead to a sense of tackiness. In fact, violence is probably the one word most commonly used to describe American History X and its content, yet there is so much more depth. For those of a nervous or perhaps conservative disposition, it's probably not the best movie to watch. Yet in American History X, the brutality of race-hate is paired up with a prominent feeling of hope and redemption.<br/><br/>The film focuses on the life of Derek Vinyard (played here by an inspired Edward Norton), a former Neo-Nazi recently released from prison after serving three years for a violent crime. We follow his actions in the following 24 hours after being released as he tries to save his younger brother from falling prey to the same cause as he did. We watch as Vinyard confronts his past and plans for a new future, all the while learning from his brother Danny how Derek became this way. This is achieved by including flashbacks (in black and white) of previous events.<br/><br/>Norton gives an electric performance, seemingly transformed from his oh-so-weakly stereotyped characters to a lean, brutal young man, full of force and hate. His character, Derek, changes before your eyes over the course of his film, allowing the viewer to be drawn into his world before captivating you with his vivid and shocking experiences. Avery Brooks seems to reprise his role as Benjamin Sisko from Star Trek: Deep Space Nine - an authority figure, complete with booming voice and didactic tendencies - if it ain't broke, don't fix it!<br/><br/>It's not all great though. Edward Furlong seems to be a one trick horse from what I have seen. Presented with a role just begging to be explored, he seems to pull the same face for each shot. I can't help but flash back to Terminator 2 for that reason! And yes, for some, the violence is too much to handle. It is by no means a constant theme, but it keeps rearing its ugly head to keep your feelings churning.<br/><br/>And as for the ending, well, you will have to find out for yourselves. Personally, I thought it was fantastic the first time that I watched it, although not everybody considers it a fitting ending. But I considered it particularly poignant and cathartic, and as the credits began to roll I reached for the remote and played it again.

","Undoubtedly the talented and brilliant Ed Norton's finest performance. Norton is cast as the brutal, unsentimental skinhead Derek Vinyard.  The film is told from two separate yet somewhat parallel stories.  Half of it in film noir black and white flashbacks and the other half in color. The color portions center on Derek and his younger brother, Danny played honestly and superbly by Ed Furlong.  The latter on Derek and his metamorphosis into the psychotic white supremacist. Without question, Norton's strong, central performance shines through in the film both as the incorrigible skinhead and as the reformed realist.  There was large controversy surrounding the film's original release.  Director Kaye wanted his name removed entirely from the credits because Norton had re-edited the film considerably from Kaye's original piece.  Be that as it may, the film remains a masterpiece about urban racial conflicts, wars and prejudice.  Norton and Kaye's film is honest, shocking, often brutal and always engaging.  A must-see for teenagers and parents of teenagers alike."

","I used to think that ""American History X"" was of questionable quality. I first saw it when a friend and I rented it thinking it would be a funny skinhead flick. After that it became somewhat of a guilty pleasure. It never seemed to be too present in the mainstream, not the kind of movie you can bring up in a crowd and invoke an impassioned discussion. After a recent viewing I can positively say that ""History"" is a very good movie whether you like it or not, due in no small part to Tony Kaye serving double duties as both director and cinematographer.<br/><br/>Through a splintered timeline,""American History X"" tells the story of Derek Vinyard (Ed Norton) and his family. Derek is a Disciples of Christ neo-Nazi in Venice Beach, California whose family falls apart starting with the murder of his father in a Compton drug den and climaxing with Derek's violent hate crime and subsequent incarceration. Derek is released from prison to face the state of poverty his family has fallen into and the fact that his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong)is following along the same path as him. Derek immediately sets out to educate his brother on the painful truth of his life in the hopes that he can save Danny from meeting the same fate.<br/><br/>As I said earlier, director Tony Kaye also handled the photography for the picture. Kaye has a remarkable eye, and we are given a multitude of poignant images that, had the film recieved more recognition, would have gone on to be iconic. Visuals that haunt the memory, like Derek's frightening grin when he is being arrested, the neo-Nazi hordes goose stepping around their Venice Beach compound and the Vinyard brothers as infants,playing on the beach. That's just to name a few.<br/><br/>I've often heard the castigating point of view that ""History"" is throwaway garbage whose only redeeming quality is Edward Norton's inimitable performance. I couldn't disagree with this more. As far as the acting, there are more than strong performances all around: Furlong as Danny convincingly portrays the conflict and confusion in youth; Avery Brooks stands out as the African-American high school principle who stayed with Derek from when he was his pupil through his imprisonment; Stacy Keach plays a man you exemplifies the character you love to hate in Cameron Alexander, the white power entrepreneur who profited from Derek's ruin.<br/><br/>I've even been able to overcome my initial reservations. The basketball scene always struck me as laughable. Its a simple enough scenario: the skinheads challenge the blacks to a game and the outcome will determine who controls the courts. If the blacks lose, they have to leave the courts and never look back. Its a trivial event but the score for the scene is an epic orchestral piece that swells as if the fate of the world were in the balance. I used to think that this was just a bad decision by the director, but now I think the effect is intentional: Kaye doesn't want the audience to take the neo-Nazis seriously. Obviously their cause and consequences are of the utmost seriousness, but Kaye makes sure the viewers always keep their distance before buying into their propaganda. The music reflects the way that the skinheads see the situation: to them, this really is a monumental event. They're probably hearing the epic music in their heads at that moment.<br/><br/>Being a geek, I find it interesting to note the Star Wars parallels present in the film. Derek Vinyard is Anakin Skywalker aka Darth Vader). Cameron Alexander is Palpatine. Alexander (Palpatine) makes Vinyard (Vader) his apprentice and manipulates him into doing his dirty work for him. This leads the apprentice to commit heinous acts of evil and undergo traumatic physical and psychological changes (Derek transformation and hardships in prison, Anakin's transformation into Vader). In ""History"", Luke the son becomes Danny the younger brother. Alexander (Palpatine) sets his sights on Danny (Luke) sensing that he would be a powerful ally. Derek (Vader) senses that Danny is going to be exploited and destroyed just as he was, so he rises up and overthrows his former master (Derek assaulting Cameron at the party > Vader killing Palpatine in the second Death Star). Just something to muse over.<br/><br/>""American History X"" is a powerful film. I don't know if it will cause a change of heart in those of the racist persuasion, but it presents many discussion points and is guranteed to cause even the most casual film viewer to think about the ideas portrayed long after leaving the theater. Many people find the movie difficult to watch. The road to redemption is not pretty. ""American History X"" shows the ugly face of ignorance and its many consequences."

","I've read many reviews regarding this movie and the majority of them declare that either A. this is the greatest movie of all time and teaches us a very valuable lesson, or B. this movie was highly disturbing and overly vulgar and gory. I found the movie to be neither of those extremes. In the highly anti-Nazi attitude of the American society, I can see how most Americans would fully support this movie which apparently shows the -dangers- of racism, specifically white power ideals. Coming from a city (I grew up in the middle of Los Angeles) with the most diverse of backgrounds, I've learned that every ethnic group is racist to a certain degree, and this movie gives off the impression that neo-Nazi white power itself is a horrible thing, rather than the actual violence that stems from it. Racism is and has always been present everywhere, but it did not necessarily mean that it directly and inevitably causes violence. And even Derek had killed those two black men out of personal offense. Derek was able to come up with highly detailed explanations for his hatred, which were valid regardless of how unreasonable his methods of solving those ""problems"" were. As a person he does have the right to interpret and judge facts however he chooses. Morally speaking he does not have the right to carry out those judgments in a way that harms others. That point is not made clear because of the incredible stress on the hatred the characters have for others for no other reason that that they are non-white. On Derek's father's note on affirmative action, I couldn't help but think how every group seems to disagree with affirmative action for different reasons, and that being against affirmative action does not necessarily mean that it stems from anti-colored feelings. And even the symbols that the movie tried to slide into the movie were too blatant, again stressing that these people were obsessed with blacks because they were so against them, again just because they were black. There's no reason why a purely black jelly bean would sit right on top center of a full bowl of nothing but white jelly beans. The most moving shots that I've found were those of Derek taking a shower, as the water cascades over his head.<br/><br/>On a different note, I've never heard of a case where a person convicted of manslaughter was sentenced to only three years in prison while the person who had supposedly assaulted a cop was sentenced to six years. And Derek, as smart as he is, is unable to give any specific reason as to why he decided to change his ways and embrace blacks, while he had been able to talk non-stop as to why he was racist. I didn't find this movie to be a good representative of Edward Norton's acting abilities, although Edward Furlong shined and yet disappoingly got very little attention. The actresses who played their mother and sister also gave very brilliant performances. As I had seen this movie after I had heard all the hype, I couldn't help but be slightly disappointed, and felt that the movie fed its audience what it wanted rather than proposing a new view."

And the fact that a black kid then gratuitously kills his kid brother would only validate that choice in a white nationalist's mind.<br/><br/>Tony Kaye was a commercials director, but the film mercifully avoids visual excesses most of the time. On the other hand, as re-edited by Norton it emerges as little more than the standard liberal uplift, why-can't-we-all-get-along message pic, with added swearing and sex which ensures it won't be seen by its most potentially impressionable audience, the under-18s.<br/><br/>Elliott Gould is stuck into one scene as a wet Jewish liberal, improbably dating the brothers' widowed mother. Avery Brooks, the rifle-wielding sidekick from ""Spenser: For Hire"", does an image change to become an infinitely wise school principal ""with TWO PhDs"". Neither character supplies much of a reason why Derek should change his ways; nor do the prison scenes. Ultimately, the reformation is presented not as a political but as a private necessity, since ""life's too short to be p*ssed off all the time"". Danny tells us to listen to ""the better angels of our nature"" and a heavenly chorus swells over a pretty sunset. Therapy culture triumphs: purge yourself of racism and feel better about yourself, especially if you can relocate to a gated community with the remains of your family, grow your hair and get a white-collar job.<br/><br/>Oh, and even if your dad's a fireman who died on the job, don't forget to repudiate him. In an extraordinary scene towards the end, it's suggested that the father's well-reasoned hostility to affirmative action set Derek on a course which led to ""Mein Kampf"" and trysts with a sinister backroom manipulator of punk music lovers. That's the problem with ""American History X"": as soon as you begin to think about its premises, it collapses in a heap of absurdities."

","As a huge fan of Edward Norton, I feel drawn to see any film of his. 'American History X', however was the film that cemented my admiration for such a young and brilliant actor. When I first saw him in 'Primal Fear' I figured that it would be that film that set him apart from the rest, but as soon as I saw 'American History X' it changed.<br/><br/>'American History X' is one of the few films that change your life. I don't think anyone could watch it without feeling touched in one way or another. Whether it's because they see themselves in one of the characters or because of the sudden disrespect you feel at being a human, you are touched in some way or another.<br/><br/>The story sets to tell the tale of the Derek Vinyard and Danny Vinyard, two brothers once joined by power, destruction and racism but now torn apart by the things that they once held close to their hearts and valued above everything. After a three year sentence in prison, Derek Vinyard has been taught a few lessons and his out look on life has changed. No longer does he hate black people and strive for a day when everything is 'American', he now values family over everything that he had, power, love and the label of the white man.<br/><br/>Although some people may find this film hard to watch it should be shown to people as a lesson in what is and isn't important in life. It should be used and a warning to people who no longer hold human beings as equals and are shallow enough to only see the colour of someone's skin, and more importantly see it as a good thing.<br/><br/>This film is flawless, from start to finish the editing, lighting, sound, acting, direction and script shine so brightly it's indescribable. Trust me when I say that this film will change your whole out look on life. The fact that this film only received one Oscar nomination to me sum's up the poor state of affairs when such a ground breaking film is not acknowledged.<br/><br/>Star rating off the chart and it will probably be the most productive 114 minutes of your year."
"Thomas-Ford","Null","0","0","23 September 2003"," Take it for what it is.
","First of all I would like to say that AHX is a very good movie. It has good actors, good suspense and an interesting premise. I don't have to praise the acting job of Edward Norton on here because it has already been done enough. The other actors including Edward Furlong also do a pretty decent job. But like I said, take it for what it is, A GOOD ""MOVIE"". A good movie can consist of two elements that makes it ""Good"". One of these is good entertainment(which this movie is) and very unrealistic(which this movie is).<br/><br/>First let me tell you that racism is a very real problem in this country(USA) and in most places all over the world. Myself being a Black man in America knows all too well the reality of blatant and subtle racism. So I give this ""MOVIE"" some credit for touching on the subject. But my biggest complaint about this ""MOVIE"" is how unrealistic it truly is.<br/><br/>
Let me begin. First of all, skinheads in America are not seen as much of a threat in American reality as they are portrayed to be in this film. Tell the avarage American Black, White, Brown, whatever that ""the Skinheads are on the move"" and they'll just shrug their shoulders and go about their business. This film tries to portray the Skinheads as much as a threat as say, the Klan in the post civil war South up until the Civil Rights Movement. Now that Klan, in that time period, was indeed a very realistic threat to Blacks and anyone who opposed them. This ""MOVIE"" tries to portray the skinheads in this same light(or dark) and it just doesn't work for me.<br/><br/>*Possible Spoilers*<br/><br/>Second of all. The basketball scene(as said by other commenters) has to be one of the most unrealistic scenes in the history of Hollywood. A bunch of skinheads driving a bunch of supposedly hardcore gangbangers off the court would, NEVER, NEVER, EVER, HAPPEN!!! If you have ever been to L.A. you would know that this is a rediculous scene. I mean a lot of the gang infested areas of L.A. have a lot of police wary to go in them. What do you think gangbangers would do to some skinheads? Especially skinheads who are using the N-Word so fluenty. Exactly. I just was hoping for a ""Don't try this at home"" warning to flash across the bottom of the screen.<br/><br/>
Third thing that bothered me was the depiction of prison. Here we see Derek Vinyard and his skinhead buddies skipping through prison like it was an amusement park. Like they are highly represented diplomats, conducting business and going about their merry little ways. Now most of us know that most major prisons of the country are not like this. Whites in most major prisons have very small numbers. The prison system population is dominated by Blacks and Hispanics(unfortunately). The most believable comment was made by Guy Torrey when he said ""In here, your the n***a"". In the real world, in most prison situations, Derek and his merry men wouldn't stand a chance if the sh*t hit the fan. And Guy Torrey's character putting his life on the line for Derek, I'm just not buying that.<br/><br/>The last thing I will elaborate on is the skinhead party scene(just shaking my head). Ok, so we have King Derek(with his god like status) just march into the skinhead leader's office(Cameron), kick the living sh*t out of him, and just waltz out. Ok, he had a gun. But do you mean to tell me that none of the other 150 or so skinheads had guns? If these skinheads were truly the great threat to society this movie wants us to believe they are then Derek would have went home in pieces. This scene just has me at a loss for words(almost as much as the basketball scene). I was thinking to myself, ""who is this guy, Derek Matrix"".<br/><br/>I have to disagree with some of the commenters that the last scene with Edward Furlong's character being shot, was over the top, uncalled for, and unrealistic. Yeah all he did was blow smoke in the guys face. But look all over this country today and kids are killing kids in schools all the time for less offenses. Bullying and being a part of a different social group come to mind. So that can and does happen. The proof is in the pudding.<br/><br/>But for what it is, a ""MOVIE"", it is very good and entertaining. It did it's job, it kept me watching with anticipation.<br/><br/>Like I said earlier in my review, racism is very real, and it needs to be delt with. I give this movie thumbs up for trying to deal with the issue. If they just could have done it in a more realistic way this film could have been more than just a film."

Norton puts in a powerful performance, that at times has you almost wondering if he is actually fighting a just cause. The film itself is rather slow paced, but for the better I would say. This film isn't for the Van Diesel generation, this film is for those of us who like substance, meaning and good acting in our films.<br/><br/>They storytelling is wonderful, with a dual perspective on some scenes seen from the point of view from Edward Furlong (who plays the younger brother) as he idolises his Brother (Edward Norton).<br/><br/>The film itself follows Derek (Edward Norton)and his brother(Edward Furlong) through the problems they've had with racism and the blacks that have 'infested' there local area (and eventually killed there father), which causes Derek to join a cell against Blacks. The film however isn't one sided at all, in fact it shows both sides equally, and the climax of the film is tragic after all that Derek has tried throughout the film.<br/><br/>It's unfair however to place all of the credit on Edward Norton, as Edward Furlong also plays a fantastic role as Norton's younger brother, who Norton tries to save and reform. In fairness the whole cast, while it may not be 'Mainstream' is fantastic and everyone puts in a powerful and truely believable performance.<br/><br/>This film will make you think, it will make you grimach ""bite the curb"".

","American History X is a piece of brilliant satire that director Tony Kaye took to the next level.  No one has ever to my knowledge made a film about Nazism.  It's all ways been considered such a sacred thing that no director, producer, or movie goer would ever want to touch.  The amount of symbolism and irony in this film is unbelievable.   Edward Norton as usual delivers a brilliant preformance as a White supremicist who is jailed for murdering two gang members for attempting to break into his car.  While he is in prison his younger brother (Edward Furlong) begins to show signs that he is following in his brothers foot steps.  While in prison nortons character meets a group of fellow skin heads who end up turning on him.  It is then that he relizes that you can't hold a certain group of people responible for the actions of just a few, and that hate is just a waste of time.  The entire cast delivers an excellent preformance.  I strongly recomend this film to those with a strong stomach and a desire to see a film that wasn't made for profits, but made to teach something.

","American History X tore out of me any innocence that might have been left concerning race relations today.  There is no doubt that this movie is passionate about the pockets of American people who are so embittered over each other's race.  The journey of a Neo-Nazi (Norton) from his first encounter with racism to the spiralling descent into hellish prison ends with an indescribable finale that left me paralyzed in my seat.<br/><br/>  Edward Norton is quite possibly the finest actor of his generation, proving yet again that his ability to seep into a dark, uninhibited soul is paramount among his peers.  Edward Furlong has come a little ways since the tough kid John Conner of Terminator 2 fame; he has the same attitude, but the context of the movie certainly adds clout to his performance.  The surrounding cast is amazing.  Beverly D'Angelo is truly amazing as the desperate mother of two lost boys, and Avery Brooks as the determined Principal attempting to free the would-be Neo Nazis scores big.<br/><br/>  The cinematography, o the cinematography!!!  The non-linear story ties in to Danny's class assignment on his brother wonderfully; the change from color to b&w works very well; all the past events seem even more brutal and honest than the scenes in color do.  The one piece I would have to pick on American History X for is a few loose ends that seemed to be asking to be resolved at the end.  The angry Neo-Nazi gang, the basketballers from the past, and the high school thugs all had a very equal and probable chance of reentering the plot at the crucial point, but the two left out of the picture were a small distraction when the main focus was staring me in the face.<br/><br/>  Overall, this intense and violent portrait of hate in America left me emotionally paralyzed for several minutes.  I can't even describe the roller coaster of nihlist-to-optimist-to-confused emotions the movie left in my lap after the climax.

","In the late nineties there was a trendy movement towards so-called independent films.  American History X, though riding the tail end of the fad, did attempt to cash in on the new found popularity, in the mainstream, of the Sundance Film Festival.  In American History X Edward Norton cements his position as one of the most gifted actors of our time.  His terrifyingly real portrayal of Derek, a neo-nazi driven over the edge by the neighbor-hood he grew up in turning into a 'haven for drug addicts and gangs'.<br/><br/>Norton is also backed by a wonderful supporting cast.  Edward Furlong (Yes of Terminator 2 fame) delivers a delicious portrayal of a young man disillusioned and abandoned by his brother.  The scenes between Derek and Danny (Furlong) are colorful and vibrant contrasting against the simple and crumbling city about the brothers.  The mixture of admeration and hatred that people feel for their idols, especially one that has been torn from their pedastol of reverence, is utilized so well in this film that it does make the film feel almost like a showcase for the wonderful acting rather than the rather amateur plot.  However that plot is genius in the way that it delivers its' message; so simple sleek and easy to understand, or is it? The psychological aspects presented in this film, attempting to explain why poeple become what they are using a neo-nazi as a general example, are all quite relevant and the film at times becomes a soap-box for the makers to showcase their feelings on the social inequalities in The United States of America.  The scene discussing Rodney King, which I was frightened of from the start, is so over the edge and in your face that it almost becomes unbearable to watch sometimes.  yet somehow you can't take you're eyes off of Eliot Gould or Norton.  All of the actors in this film should receive praise for their roles; especially Fairuza Baulk who reprised her role as the black haired hellion heart throb, though there's a bit of a switch up when she plays the supportive girlfriend to Derek.<br/><br/>The last thing that I will rave about it the cinematography.  I must admit before I begin that I enjoy black and white photo prints and films a great deal so I am a bit biased when one comes along but... The black and white cinematography used in the flashbacks doesn't affect the film in a negatize way that most heavily edited films do.  Somehow it retains the feeling of reality, even the slow motion shots were well done. Norton looked nothing short of pure evil during his arrest.  The black and white plays so well off of Edward Furlong's oral narration (quite reminesent of Fight Club, except Furlong rather than Norton drives the films narration).  The dryly read script that serves as the narrator is masterfully edited, the scenes were planned out and edited with out a hitch.  My one complaint with the film is Edward Norton's crying... I mean he can do almost anything else but he can not convince me he is crying.  In Fight Club he pulled it off by being plunged in Bob's Bitch tits but here he has no cover and it does serve to detract from some of the more emotional scenes, he doesn't even sound like - let a lone look like he's crying!  Okay I'm done I swear.<br/><br/>American History X is one of the premier films for fans of good acting in a time of 9 out of 10 crap outs.  Norton, Furlong, Gould, Brooks(from Star Trek Voyager, who also out does himself again, though his role is to short for him to truly shine),D'Angelo, and Keach each deliver what could be the best performances of many of their careers.  If you havn't seen this film you should UNLESS; You don't like graphic violence (If Fight Club freaked you out) steer clear, if graphic sex scenes disturb you or you are viewing with younger children - beware, and most of all if you like happy go lucky up beat hip-hop crap (or perhaphs you just like Norton) you shouldn't run out and rent this."

If you haven't seen it happen, then don't comment on the realism of the movie. Furthermore, while that appeared to be a large member of neo-nazis, it's in no way inaccurate.

","I was over joyed when Roberto Benigni won the best actor Oscar in '98.  But after giving HISTORY a second viewing, it's hard not to think of Norton as being robbed.  However it may have left a bad taste in one's mouth, had a portrayal of a neo-nazi won over that of a Holocaust victim.  Norton's performance is the most compelling I've ever seen.  I say this because, we see him portray not one, but three characters: Derek the distraught but intelegant teenager; Derek the brutal, articulate skinhead; Derek the reformed, mature adult.<br/><br/>It would be an understatement to say that this film is thought-provoking.  Through Derek's persuasive retoric on all things race-related, we are forced to consider the validity in his arguments.  Any viewer will find themselves desperate to effectively question the credibility of what Derek says.<br/><br/>During the scene at the dinner table in which Derek gives a lecture on his discontent with multi-racial society, it's frustrating to see him go unchalenged.  All I wanted was for the liberal boyfriend to ask Derek what exactly he was going to do in his lifetime to effectively bring about a change in the problems he was ranting about.<br/><br/>But no matter how credible Derek's ideology is, it can not excuse the racially motivated acts of violence played out on screen.  The sequence in which Derek's gang attack a grocery store and brutalize the minorities inside is not only effective in the way it condemns racist acts.  It also portrays the skinheads as cowardly for victimizing a young woman and an old man, as opposed to chalenging any of the local gangs. There is a user below who has questioned - understandably so - just how much we should worry about skinhead violence.   The fact remains that gays, bi-racial couples, or even white kids leaving a regae concert are at risk of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the film's length doesn't do justice to the story or the characters.  SPOILER:  While in prison, Derek is excorsized of his debilitating hatred.  This is effected by befriending a black inmate, being victimized by white inmates, and reading literature sent by his black, former history teacher.  The problem is we don't know what  literature he is reading.  It seems a little too easy, but never the less, understandable.   END OF SPOILER.<br/><br/>With it's stylistic cinematography, sweeping orchestral soundtrack, and superb performances, HISTORY is a great film which could have been better had it been longer.  In the end, the film is not trying to send a message simply to those who are intolerant towards ethnic minorities, gays, religious or political groups, but to anyone who lets themself be consumed by anger or negativity.  No one wants to die p**sed off."

","`American History X' is, among innumerable other things, a character study at the core. Edward Norton plays Derek Vinyard, a prodigious, reformed, former white supremacist released from prison after three years for killing two African-Americans. Edward Furlong portrays Danny, his younger brother, who idolizes Derek (even more so after said arrest) and begins moving along the same hate-filled path in high school. The film crosscuts between the past, in black and white, beginning with Derek's lapse into racism inherited by his father (who's killed by a gang while working as a firefighter) to his release from prison and between his contemporary attempts in the course of about 12 hours to set Danny straight. Danny's come under the thumbs of Cameron, a rich white-power activist who funds propaganda, parties, white power bands, etc, and once schooled Derek.<br/><br/>Norton's Derek is portrayed as resorting to hard-core white supremacy as a panacea to the gap left in his life after his father's murder, and eventually growing to impose it on his family as shown in an absolutely shocking dinner-table scene before going completely out of control and ending up in prison. He complete transforms himself into the character, and his Derek makes an almost swaying argument about the marginalization of people in America that can happen because of `affirmative action'; more appropriately, it's easy to see what would make him resort to this form of hatred and neo-Nazism based on his personal experiences, and what makes him so convincing and influential to Danny. Derek isn't shown as a monster the way one would expect, but rather as an intelligent, sincerely enraged young man resorting to violence and enmity as explanation for the wrong blows life has dealt him; he rationalizes in hate and bigotry to compensate for what's gone wrong. And he's absolutely terrifying, while also immediately accessible. Furthermore, the dynamic between Furlong and Norton is totally believable as a relationship between brothers; Derek looks out for Danny and talks to him as an adult while they both know Danny's still a kid. The acting between the two of them reminded me in an off way of my own older brother; he's not a neo-Nazi, don't get me wrong, but the way awkwardness and love mix between two different ages is totally accurate in terms of emotional chemistry.<br/><br/>The movie approaches the race issue level-headedly and, while it definitely takes the side against racism and prejudice, it shows why people can be driven to grasp it so intensely as well as to how they can `unlearn' it. Danny follows Derek's example not because he too is consumed by the same rage but because he needs a positive role model. With this in mind, a reformed (I'm hesitant to use the word, because reformation is usually deliberate, whereas Derek is shown watching his neo-Nazist stability fall apart under its own weight in prison for a variety of reasons) Derek tries to dissuade him before it's too late. The white power group is shocked and confused when he comes back bitterly opposed to their message and in a way you can see how these people are bound together lovingly- almost like a community - through their supremacist opinions.<br/><br/>This is an important movie that deals with critical issues in our (or any) society. It's stunningly atrocious to watch and viscerally compelling, with a message that's challenging, acceptable, controversial and ultimately a thing of beauty at its center. The only problems I have with the movie are totally separate from the subject matter, but rather with the presentation of it - wall-to-wall music, slow-motion photography, etc. The dramatic impact of the scenes is potent enough on the basis of their contents, and doesn't need to be glossed up or saturated for an audience to be understood. This isn't really a problem in the movie, because the performances and dialogue keep things going smoothly, but in a more porous script I fear that this style of direction would slow things down to the point of pretension and self-indulgence. Director/cinematographer Tony Kaye seems to succumb (and this is really the only true flaw the movie could have aside from sheer unpleasantness) to a safe, clean presentation of acerbic, combustible dramatic material. This is a brilliant, electrifying stuff that needs to be seen by anyone who's wondered about the consequences (or the realistic defects) of intolerance."

","American History X has its heart in the right area but unfortunately just because the topic of a movie deals with a topic that can expose you to things you never want to be exposed to, doesn't necessarily make it a good movie.<br/><br/>The movie involves Derek Vinyard who has an experience that has changed his life, his thoughts, his feelings, and his attitude to the way he sees the world, which before was a black and white world full of hate while in prison, where he meets Lamont.  I feel the best moments are between Derek and Lamont.  After getting out of prison his attention is focused on his little brother, Danny, who has begun to wander down the same road he had walked down, and Derek is trying to convince his brother that his ideas were wrong and the path he took was bad. The problem i have is that he manages to convince his brother all in one day, for something that took him what seems to be a lifetime of hate and took some serious convincing including a couple shots up the anus he manages to get his brother with no resistance.<br/><br/> The best moments are when Derek and Lamont are communicating and arguing with each other, it exposes the Derek character to someone he never really had a chance to meet.<br/><br/>The other impressive moments come with the tattoos.  The tattoos served as a symbol of pride before he went to jail, he had no shame in showing it off. But when he gets out of jail, the tattoos serve as a reminder of what he was and what he did, and he can never get rid of it.  It becomes shame.  This is shown when he is at home and he has finished taking a shower, he stares at himself in the mirror looking at the tattoos, this moment can't be described words, its a scene you have to see you literally feel the pain.<br/><br/>All in all, from the beautiful beginning to the ironic ending this movie is only considered good because it deals with important topics.  Whether the movie was made like a good movie is different question.  Edward Norton has his moments but those are just moments."

","*May Contain Spoilers*<br/><br/>I first saw this film three years ago when I was 14.  My friend suggested it to me; she said it had a moving plot and would have an amazing effect on me. She did warn me that it was quite violent (especially the rape scene), but that I should nevertheless still view it for its powerful message.  I took her advice and rented it.<br/><br/>Now I know what you're thinking: ""How could a 14 year old understand this movie?  How could they get anything out of it?""  Believe me, I was a very mature 14 year old (not that I'm not mature now, at 17), and I understood this movie's message perfectly.<br/><br/>The plot: Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) is a former Nazi who was jailed for murdering a black man.  While in jail, he slowly befriends another black man and begins to see the error of his ways. (Let me remind you that this doesn't happen overnight; it is a ""gradual"" process).  Once he is released from jail, he is determined to keep his younger brother from following the same path he did.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Danny Vinyard (Edward Furlong) gets in trouble for writing a book report on ""Mein Kamph"" (did I spell that right?).  Rather than suspension or expulsion, the teacher tells him to write a report about his brother Derek's life.<br/><br/>On a side note: You have to feel sort of sorry for Danny; he is a confused boy that looked up to his brother and is trying to follow in his footsteps. I'm not saying what he's doing is right; I'm simply stating that one should feel sympathy for him; he really doesn't know what he's doing to himself.<br/><br/>I haven't seen any other films with Norton in them, but I doubt that they could match his excellent performance in this movie.  The hatred he emitted was so real; you really would think he actually hated blacks and minorities. Furlong was also great as Danny, though at some parts, I thought he wasn't really into his character (but maybe that's just me).<br/><br/>Now some people may compare this film to ""Schindler's List.""  DON'T DO THAT. ""Schindler's List"" was a cinematic masterpiece; very few films on this particular topic match the depth, detail, and emotion conveyed in that movie.  ""American History X"" is not meant to be compared to ""Schindler's List.""  Think about Shakespeare's play, ""Romeo and Juliet.""  Now think of the movie based on the play (the one with Leonardo DiCaprio).  The movie was decent, made you laugh and cry, but could never match the tragedy and romance that the original play had.  It's purpose was to entertain and give a message.  Treat ""American History X"" the same way.<br/><br/>Overall, a powerful, chilling film, right up to the horrifying conclusion.

","Few films have had an effect on viewers (at least for me) like 'American History X.' The movie gives us excellent characters and a meaningful plot and send a timeless message...""hate is baggage."" The story involves Danny (Ed Furlong) and his brother Derek(Ed Norton). Danny is a punk and his teacher makes him write an essay after Danny does a book report on Mein Kampf. Danny eventually decides to just start writing about his older brother and skin-head leader, Derek. He tells about the family's past, how the father was killed by some black men and how Derek began to gain prestige as a Nazi Skinhead gang leader... Then Derek gets out of prison for murdering 2 black men.  Now a changed man, he tries to steer his younger brother away from the Nazi Skinhead movement by giving him his story of being in prison and how horrible it was. This creates conflict in Danny who tried so hard to be like is older brother and is already deep into the local skinhead group. The film does an excellent job of striking emotions in the viewer. As a white man, I cringed when Derek stomps on the black man's head while making him bite the curb, but I could sort of sympathize with Derek as he goes off on a rant at the dinner table about how minorities bring down the system. The film does this constantly to us: IT uses triumphant music, humor, and character strengths to make us believe in Derek. We cheer when the skinheads beat the black guys in basketball for possession of the courts, but then we want to strangle Derek and his buddies when they terrorize the local convenience store which employs minorty workers. This is the other way the film gets us, by making us angry at the skinhead group and ultimately sympathetic again for Derek and his family at the film's end. The acting is incredible throughout the film. Norton was horribly snubbed as best actor in '98 for this movie. The characters are believable and we learn to care about them. Even if you are sensitive to racial issues or squeamish about profanity or nudity, you should not avoid 'American History X'. It is very powerful and may change the way you feel about certain people. You don't want movies to tell you WHAT to do, but this one, like 'Boyz n the hood' gives you an idea of what might happen if you don't have an open mind.

You will not find one film with Norton that is just a walk-through picture.  American History X is most certainly one of the most thought-provoking movies he has ever done.  The story of a neo-nazi who goes through an ideological change in prison when he is befriended by a black man is very good.  But, Norton makes the story even better by giving his character a lot of intelligence.

But, let's be serious: does a movie have to be recognized by a hand of people to be good?<br/><br/>    From the beginning to the end of the movie you shall feel the intensity of the things that are happening. You shall tremble, and you shall fear. You shall think and you shall see, that maybe you know these things. Or, maybe not. It's a thrilling walk, through our present world. It's something you might not understand. It's something you might not accept. It's that fact that some people do think the way it's presented in the movie. Maybe one of those is reading this. I'm sure that those people will say the movie sucked. And maybe it did for them. You can choose to either be as blind as.or to be as open minded as  Derek. It's your choice. And whatever you will do, you will have to say it before God. Of course, for these people the only problem is: God does not exist. As proven, it's not a lost cause, and you can always turn around. There's one point of view out of which I fear this movie probably failed. If it's only purpose was to entertain, then it's merits are sky high. But, if it had the objective to change the way some people are thinking, I doubt it succeeded. That's what I believe. Sadly, the movie only repeats the things most of the people know. It can be less impressive for some, out of a simple reason: It shows you reality, a reality in which you live in, but a reality which you already know. Or think you know. The fact that at the end Danny dies, killed by a black kid will leave a big question open: what will Derek do? What will he do now, after his second relative is killed by a black personhe might turn back to his old waysit remains an open question, and the answer will depend on each persons character. I myself, believe that he shall not stray on the wrong path again. Despite that fact that all you learn, can be unlearned, I think that after the lesson he got in prison, he will not waste his life without doing anything good for him, his family, or any other person.<br/><br/>    Now to the cinematic part. I think Edward Norton was simply amazing! He fit so well in his role and he acted so flawlessly that he would have deserved a tiny, tiny bit of the Oscar. Of course, Roberto Benigni's acting was as good as Norton's, and it's very hard for me to choose a winner. I would go though on Benigni, because I have a good feeling when American awards are handed over to non English speaking people. I mean people who don't have English as their native language of course.<br/><br/>      Norton though is one of the actors which will have( if you don't want to say he already has) a shining career as an actor.        Edward Furlong showed some impressive skills, and surely deserves to be called a great hope of modern cinematography.        I would like to end the review here, because there isn't much more to say to it. This movie should be seen without hesitation by everyone, because it can be a lesson. And I ask, can a movie be brilliant if it doesn't effect the viewers' lives?    Rating? 9.5/10"

Now he's abandoned his school work, ditched his loving family and joined a neo-nazi organization.

So finally one day Derek finally does it, commits murder. So after being sentenced to 3 years in prison for voluntary man slaughter. Get's out to find out the truth about life and ditches the whole neo-nazi thing. Now his main goal is to get his family back on track, and get his brother out of the predicament that he put him in, and do it as quietly as possible.<br/><br/>Overall, very moving and brutal story behind the truth of neo-nazi's, the fact that all they are are a bunch of kids who get tired of being pushed around by other races.

"Jon_Mathias","Null","0","0","20 November 2002"," Great performances, unconvincing story
","Warning - spoilers herein.<br/><br/>I've only just seen this film on DVD and rented it to see Edward Norton, one of the most watchable actors of his generation. His performance, particularly in the first half of the film, is stunning.  The opening sequence where we see Norton's character, Derek Vinyard, gun down two black men intent on stealing his car, is breathtaking.<br/><br/>Norton is utterly convincing as the angry, articulate skinhead of the first half of the film.  The film never really makes it clear why he has become a racist and the scene where his father warns him against positive discrimination is not plausible as a basis for his becoming a Nazi.  I can forgive the film-maker this omission; what I cannot forgive is the trite, sentimental way in which Vinyard apparently abandons his extreme views to the extent that he betrays his former Nazi comrades.  What is his motivation for this Pauline conversion?  A few conversations on sport with a black guy he is obliged to work with in the prison.  This simply beggars belief.  As another reviewer has already commented, the point where the concerned liberal teacher asks him 'Has anything you have done made your life better?' is ridiculous - you do not fight for causes to improve your personal circumstances.<br/><br/>The film is very lazy in that it takes the audience's liberal viewpoint for granted. At no point does a character convincingly question Vinyard's opinions on race or immigration.  It is simply accepted that he is a complete lunatic and that no challenge is therefore necessary.  This is of course extremely dangerous.  In Europe, anyone who questions immigration or racial integration policies is simply labelled racist by the political establishment with no further comment deemed necessary.  This has led to the rise of the far right in France, Holland and, to a lesser extent, in the UK. Lazy, complacent films like American History X will contribute to a similar process in the US.  It was great to see an American film dealing with such a difficult topic as US Nazism but American History X is a lost opportunity.<br/><br/>Great performance from Edward Norton but he was badly let down by the script."

","In general this movie is pretty good, scripting, directing and acting. Avery brooks and Edward Norton, but..<br/><br/>
**********spoiler********** at the end it was way too obvious that either danny or derek would be killed.  I mean as soon as that day started where derek took danny to school, it was obvious one of them wouldn't live.  The slow motion setting created an artificial tension that should be natural from the plot so-far, but they did not completely make everything predictable in the end.  It was unclear whether the D.O.C. would come for derek or the gangbangers.  I personally assumed it would be the D.O.C. because danny's girlfriend met him at school, which I remember her being at the D.O.C. party.  So Overall this was a very good movie, why it wasn't a popular I am not clear of except maybe that mainstream film is headed for mind-less violence and sex in favor over a good plot and realistic acting."

","American History X is ultimately a story about reformation and wisdom. The film is told in the present and in the past, which is uniquely shown in black and white, possibly suggesting it should be forgotten. Danny (Ed Furlong) hears three black guys outside trying to hijack Derek (Edward Norton)'s car. Danny alerts Derek to what is happening, the first thing you notice is the swatztika on Derek's chest, immediately making the connection between that and the black guys, quickly thinking to yourself this will be a bloodbath, this is straight out spoken when Derek picks up his gun and marches out the door vigoriously. Danny quickly shoots one of the guys dead at point blank, wounds another, and shoot the driver. Derek then goes over to the man he shot on the street and commits one of the harshest and shocking punishments ever been shown on cinema, some might want to look away during this part.<br/><br/>American History X tells the past story of Derek's prison time, and how he painfully changed from a black-hearted racist to a kind and caring brother. The transformation process is not only extremely interesting but very surreal too. Parrallel to that story is Danny, who has been taken in by Derek's old mentor Cameron (Stacy Keach), and leader of a neo-nazi group who commits acts of vandalism and cruelty to minority groups in order to reclaim a small part of Los Angelas for the white people. Soon in the movie it's revealed that Derek is being released from prison today, the family and especially Danny await his arrival, expecting the old Derek, not the new reformed one. Derek quickly intervines with Danny's life, showing him how is exactly going down the road Derek went, and ultimately to death or jail time.<br/><br/>Once the two worlds meet, conflicts start heating up for Danny by means of black kids at school having a grudge against him as a racist, and for Derek who confronts Cameron and his old group the D.O.C telling them that he is out. With the D.O.C enraged at him, Derek knows his life is in danger, also along with that, the friends of the slain black kids outside Derek's house three years ago also seek revenge in whatever ways they can obtain it."

","Oh, this movie truly is a punch in the stomach! Mr Norton is truly electrifying as both the nazi-thug and the reformed ex-prisoner, trying to prevent his younger brother to follow in his footsteps (an equally excellent Edward Furlong). True, the violence in this movie is very disturbing, containing a murder scene that is the strongest and nastiest I think I have ever seen. It really made me cringe. But it never becomes gratuitous or just something to titillate the viewer with, but an integral part of the story. And all the time you feel that this story could very well be a true one. Nothing is too blown up, or exaggerated out of proportions. The nazi's party looks just like documentaries I've seen on tv. Heck, I even know some people who underneath their open minded exterior have some views regarding immigrants that are not too far removed from some of the characters in ""American history X"". The visuals are also powerful. Backflashes are black and white, but it doesn't feel superficial. All performances are great with some really outstanding ones: apart from the above mentioned there is Guy Torry as Nortons black buddy in prison and D'Angelo who is convincingly confused about everything happening in her family. If the movie has any faults, it's that the time Norton spends in prison is too sketchy. He is violently raped by some fellow inmates and suddenly (well, almost) he sees the error of his ways?!?! Not very convincing. But all in all a very powerful and disturbing (in a good sense) experience!"

"dopeydave98","10","0","0","17 October 2002"," A thought provoking film with a masterful leading performance
","When the nominations were announced for the 1998 Oscars I wasn't surprised that Edward Norton had been nominated again. He had lost out in 1996 for his performance in Primal Fear, although I felt at the time the nomination was more of a recognition for a combination of his work which included The People vs Larry Flynt and Everyone Says I love You.<br/><br/>The thing that bothered me was the film... American History X. Why had I not heard of it, let alone seen it. Unsurprisingly it had got a very limited distribution in the UK, I guess because of it's content. I waited for the video release and I was not disappointed...!?!<br/><br/>Many people have lauded Norton's performance and rightly so. As a demonstration of his range it is masterful. A physical transformation akin to De Niro in Raging Bull, together with an emotional performance that takes in extreme violence, intellectual reasoning, regret, remorse and fear.<br/><br/>But there is more to this film than Norton's performance. Avery Brooks' understated Dr Sweeney allows those around him to bring out the emotion of the piece. Stacey Keach's Godfather-like quiet menace is his best role in years. Much must be said too for Tony Kaye's directing, the starkness of the black & white flashbacks works superbly on several levels. It demonstrates how Derek's reasoning was as black & white as the images on screen, together with the sheer bleakness of the life he was leading; out of date film for out of date attitudes.<br/><br/>Much has been said of the subject matter and the violence; the subject matter simply cannot be approached without reference to the violence, unfortunately that is the world we live in. David McKenna's script does not pick sides, but skillfully tells it's story without prejudice. Derek is a victim of circumstances, he's avenging the injustice of his father's death, falling under the spell of Alexander, leading the struggle on the streets against the politicians who haven't got a clue what's happening in the real world. Dereks journey from a bright schoolkid to a violent criminal seems so straightforward. Yet the real struggle is the journey back.<br/><br/>My one moan would be that we didn't get the opportunity to see more of Derek dealing with life after prison. Norton's portrayal of 'violent' Derek is the lasting image I had of the film, simply because the performance was so good. It's fair to say had he had the chance to explore 'reformed' Derek, Norton with his range would have done a fine job and the film may well have been more widely accepted.<br/><br/>All in all a brave film that demonstrates the actors craft perfectly. One of those word of mouth films, like Shawshank, that will be talked about for many years."

","""American History X"" is one of the most challenging and thought provoking movies I have ever seen.  I'm not usually big on films and filmmakers that have an ax to grind.  I prefer a good story to a good sermon most of the time, but this film manages to provide both.  The characters are so real, and their feelings are so common to young people today that it's almost scary.  The film's star, Ed Norton,  is, without a doubt, the best actor of his generation.  His performance is flawless, and is a huge part of why this movie is as good as it is.  Despite the incredibly graphic violence, the horrific language, and the nudity, this film is a must see in my book.<br/><br/> Even though most white kids in America would deny that they are racists and would completely reject any form of Nazism, they still identify with Danny Vineyard's feelings.  The racist speeches Derrick Vineyard delivers with such passion (the one in front of the grocery store, and the one at the dinner table come to mind) strike chords deep inside of most of us.  We hear him speak, and understand how people could get caught up in these ideologies.  Then, we see the results of his ideas.  Amazingly, we all sympathize with Derrick when he's crying on T.V. about his father's death; we sympathize with him when he says ""It's Americans who are poor and hungry.' and we absolutely love him when he steps in to win the basketball game.  Then we abhor him as he beats the grocery store owner.  We cringe as he smiles after brutally killing a two people.  We rail against the swastika tattooed over his heart.  Derrick Vineyard shows us something about racism that most of us overlook.  He shows us that while racism is a terrible thing, racists aren't necessarily terrible people, and he proves it during the color scenes in the movie.   The knockout punch comes with the final scenes, as the film takes a twist and gives us a piercing picture of reality that makes us reevaluate all the things we have come to feel during the course of the movie.   <br/><br/>This film is truly, an unforgettable piece of art."

"ashley-lewis","9","0","0","15 August 2002"," A Carefully Thought Out Portrayal of the Subject
","American History X is in my mind both art and entertainment. The wide array of emotions that the viewer is taken through gives immense entertainment value to it. The style with which the story is delivered adds to that value and earns it the title of art.<br/><br/>The storyline itself is an unusual and remarkable chronicle of events, but the dialogues, setting and characters are portrayed in a non-glamorous, everyday manner. Take for instance the scene in which Derek (Edward Norton) has come home for the first time. Amidst the setting, a small two bedroom flat, Derek's family look genuinely at home. Watching this scene feels somehow peculiar as though you really are snooping in someone's private life, not some kind of At Home With the Vinyards' reality show, but actually as though you are there in some sense. As all the events unfold around you this strange cinematic reality helps to absorb you a little more into the plot, with the ultimate aim that it shares with any story - to make you forget (at least for the duration) that these things didn't really happen.<br/><br/>I believe the idea of this film was not only to give the viewer something to keep them entertained for two hours but also to inform, warn or educate the viewing masses. In a manner to try and make some kind of sense of that which drives the Neo Nazi. As the characters go through their development the key issues that give rise to the irrational hatred of racism and the reasoning that people build to support it are illustrated with a series of bullet-point plot events. We are presented with various different 'flavours' of hatred, and various different classes of racist.<br/><br/>In this film the subject of all kinds of prejudice has been laid out on a public operating table and thoroughly dissected, so that anyone may see what drives the beast. What makes some Humans feel such an intense and unfounded dislike to their fellow man? Whilst it is by no means an exhaustive examination it is detailed and vast in nature, and is an element of the film pivotal to its success.<br/><br/>The performances in American History X also make the final ingredient for our Really Good Movie Cake Mix. There are some excellent Actors in this cast, but in reality the story only has room for two strong performances, and whilst the supporting roles were on the whole excellently played, they were all simply outshone by Norton and Furlong.<br/><br/>I have previously seen only 2 of Norton's leads, the Score and Fight Club. Each and every one of these 3 roles demands a completely different performance from this immensely talented actor, and I cannot fault the manner in which he has risen to the challenge on every occasion here we see a tremendous progression in his character which, despite receiving certain criticisms elsewhere, I believe to have been portrayed flawlessly, which is certainly supported by the fact that when the awards ceremonies came round the following year, Norton was the only man to be holding the awards (Golden Satellite and SEFCA) even against tough competition in that year.<br/><br/>
Edward Furlong could not have possibly improved his performance as Derek's younger brother Danny from start to finish. Although it may be true that the film takes a while to find its feet and the better scenes are mostly at the end, there was something about Furlong's performance that shone through even in the opening minutes. He manages to show the sensitivity and intellectual properties of the otherwise boisterous and angry character at just the right levels.<br/><br/>Notable supporting roles come from Ethan Suplee as Seth and Avery Brooks as Sweeney. Ethan has enjoyed fame comedy roles (Particularly throughout the Kevin Smith Films) but here he demonstrates his acting talents in a *slightly* more serious role, I say slightly because despite the dark nature of his character you can't help but grin at some of the more socially impaired qualities of his role. He portrays the typical<br/><br/>Most people will know Avery Brooks from his long standing role as Captain Sisko, a role which requires similar traits to that of Sweeney, it might be because of this that his performance comes off strangely natural when you watch him initially, but on more careful deliberation he seems too wooden in the role, although this is probably partly the fault of the script. Sweeney is a Teacher, with 2 PhD's under his cap, so why is he not teaching at a better college? The character does come across with a certain attitude of wanting to be helping where he can help most, but this good natured quality, even coupled with his caring and compassionate still don't excuse his presence in this college, his position seems to be below him. Sweeney is also as a some sort of Obi-Wan-Kenobi imparting pearls of wisdom at seemingly appropriate times and conveniently saving a lot of time by explaining other events with a few lines instead of requiring a couple of scenes.<br/><br/>All in all American History X is the film maker's way of saying `Why can't we all just get along?' but this film does it with a gun pressed to your temple. The touch subject matter has been carefully considered and then attacked full on, and I must say it works. Although within the first twenty minutes of this film I thought I hadn't seen anything but a glorification of violence and prejudice, it takes the whole film before you see the whole picture (pardon the pun), the grand concept that makes this film more than mere entertainment, it is art.<br/><br/>08/10<br/><br/>-x-"

","First things first - Edward Norton was superb in this, but so was Edward Furlong. The story is about hate, specifically racial. Problem is the outline of the story gives away too much, so I'll say this: Norton is a nazi-skinhead who despises 'foreigners' because they apparently leech off his country's government and cause American 'natives' to go without. Truth is he is just a racist who hates anyone who isn't a white christian. The movie is about how he justifies this existence and causes his own brother to follow the same path. Telling more would spoil it.<br/><br/>The story is brilliantly told without stereotyping different races - it shows how hate exists as a pre-meditated evil of society.<br/><br/>Excellent."

","I love this movie.  I'm not going to declare it ""perfect"" or one of the best films of all time, but it's nevertheless truly great.  About the first 20 minutes are pretty bad...the story is set up in a clunky manner reminiscent of after-school specials.  The all-wise principal is also artificial, but he is a minor enough character that he doesn't detract too much from the film. I also had a problem with the music in a couple of places, particularly on the basketball court.  I recognize that the usual term is ""dramatic score,"" but this score heaped the drama on way too early in some places.  Like the movie itself, however, the music recovers and begins to simply fit.<br/><br/>Ed Norton is the one who made this movie brilliant.  Sometimes when one actor dominates the screen so much the other portions of the movie suffer (personally, I'm thinking of Washington vs. the Canadians in ""Hurricane""), but in this case Furlong was compelling enough to avoid this problem, as one of the two was almost always on the screen.  The Eds are great, and Norton's nomination was well deserved.<br/><br/>****SKIP NEXT PARAGRAPH TO AVOID SPOILERS****<br/><br/>The most common complaint about this film seems to be that the character's turnaround was not believable, that it was ""overnight.""  I couldn't disagree more.  It was not overnight, but over the 1095 nights of his sentence. Derek had a lot of time to think, and that's what undercut his ideology. His Nazi brethren were ignoring the tenets of his belief system, exposing them for what they were--people latching on to an idea for identity, not for the merits of the idea.  As a thinking individual and former honors student, Derek needed to justify his feelings of hatred with logic.  Cameron's teachings fit the bill nicely.  Then he realized that people didn't care about the ideology so much as the image.  Shortly after that his Nazi friends rape him.  As he lays unconcious on the shower room floor, the word that came to my mind was ""wreck.""  Derek was completely wrecked and destroyed.  In his fragile state, who comes to visit him?  A black man.  He initially questions why his former teacher bothered to come, but as the shivering and tearful mass that he is at that point, the friend is sorely needed.  Does it all feel slightly contrived?  The emotional content of the sequence prevents the viewer from feeling the artificiality, but a cerebral examination of the events ends with an answer of ""yes.""  The teacher is too wise and saintly not to be questioned. Disbelief of the teacher's character suspended, is the transformation believable?  Yes.<br/><br/>American History X doesn't just tell you that hate is bad.  It may overtly state that ""hate is baggage,"" but it's a message of summary, not instruction.  The movie lets those who watch it truly FEEL that hatred causes pain, and does it as well as I have ever seen it done.  Ordinarily a beginning as poor as this movie's first 20 minutes would greatly lower my opinion of the remainder, but not here.  The rest of the movie is just that good.  9/10"

","This is usually the kind of movie I don't enjoy watching. I am a huge movie buff that watches for entertainment. Movies with this type of subject matter have too many hard feelings and the dreaded ""N"" word. I have seen Edward Norton in other films and got to be a fan because I think he is the best young actor today. His performance in this film was amazing. I got the same feeling watching Norton that I got when I saw DeNiro in RAGING BULL. Their acting was so good that you couldn't help but dislike them. Not only did I like Norton in this movie, I thought there was some outstanding scenes and the ending was surprisingly un-Hollywood. Unfortunately I thought Edward Furlong got short-changed. He wasn't a big enough character. I did like how the director used black and white film for flashback scenes.<br/><br/>The main reason to watch this film is Edward Norton. He definitely deserved the Oscar for best actor. I hope the Academy Awards will someday start looking towards the daring movies and characters instead of staying with the big names and the safe movies."

","Why do people only believe traumatic events push you towards the dark side in movies, but when a movie portrays a traumatic event pushing the character in a good way they refuse to believe it. Edward Norton's character has plenty of time to think in prison, and this takes three years - that is not quick at all. Prison gives you nothing but time to think. Of course we are not going to see every nuance of his change of mind over those three years, just the key moments. If you want to talk about a movie where a character makes a total chance towards race in a very short amount of time see Monster's Ball. Other review say Edward Norton's character transforms to a lover of all races. I do not see this at all. He becomes tolerant, at least to the point of being quiet. I believe silent hatred is the first step towards racial unity. This is flat out an excellent movie."

An easier over-night transformation could not be envisioned by Hollywoodland. Even the black dude who befriends him in the laundry laid it on too thick. What was the Director thinking?

","Edward Norton gives a powerhouse of a perfomance in this tense drama about race. Norton is a top member of a nazi gang who is sent to jail for three years for killing two black men tring to break into his house (one of the most powerfull moments shown in gripping black and white flashbacks). While in jail he befriends a black man, is raped in the shower and has his life comptly turned around by the time he is realeased. But upon arrival back home he sees that his little brother, played by Edward Furlong is going down that very same path and must save him before it is to late. Norton ignites the screen in his best performance to date. He gives ever line with power and emotion and Furlong is not far behind him. This film also contains one of the most powerful endings I have ever seen. It left me totally speechless.

","American History X is one of the best dramas i've seen in a long time.  The direction is excellent and it was a great choice to film Derek's past in black and white, which is highly symbolic of his racial views of the world at that time of his life.  The direction is highly expressionistic with slow motion and extreme close-ups used extensively throughout.<br/><br/>The Australian film ""Romper Stomper"" should be billed as a ""double feature"" of sorts with this film.  That film follows a group of neo-nazi skinheads around Melbourne and shows the racial hatred directed towards the asian population in the city.  Whilst it deals on resolving issues & conflict within the skinhead group itself as opposed to resolving their racial weakness, it gives a great representation of the Australian struggle with racism the same way American History X does for the USA.<br/><br/>American History X - 9 out of 10, only because the ending was a tad predictable and the change in Derek's character could have been explained a bit better."
"janqb","Null","0","0","18 June 2002"," Transformation too good to be true, but an amazing film nonetheless
","The first word that escaped my lips after the film was ""WOW"". A wonderfully directed film with outstanding performances from Edward Norton, who plays Neo-Nazi, Derek Vinyard, and Jennifer Lien, who plays his frustrated sister. ""American History X"" is one courageous movie.<br/><br/>I didn't think such a realistic and sensitive portrayal of a skinhead could be possible. Though I felt that Norton's character, after a traumatic event, capitulated to the embrace-all-minorities point-of-view too quickly, the distinct periods in which he hated minorities and accepted them were wonderfully performed. The only part of the movie that made me uncomfortable was the transformation of Derek Vinyard. Throughout the film, I sensed an urgency to turn a misguided skinhead into a good guy (maybe someone who doesn't embaress white people?). The director, writer, actors all probably wanted Derek Vinyard to become more tolerant, less angry, (and, dare I say it?) more in line with the current racial politics that embraces diversity and abhors racism.<br/><br/>But in order for Derek Vinyard to be believeable, he has to transform from a Neo-Nazi racist into less of a racist. The change in Derek Vinyard seemed overnight and miraculous. His change is like laser eye surgery that instantly restores 20/20 vision. Reality doesn't work like that. Derek the immigrant-hating Neo-Nazi suddenly became Derek the benevolent, people of color-loving liberal. I just can't buy it. Being a person of color myself, and having encountered more racism in my lifetime than I care to remember, I have never seen miraculous transformations in life. Nobody goes from complete bigotry to complete tolerance. A more credible outcome is that Derek remains uncomfortable with his former African-American history teacher and other minority groups. He will still be grappling with his conscience--guilt for the senseless murders, knowledge that he killed people of his teacher's ethnicity, and desire to protect and release himself from the misery of old hatreds.<br/><br/>This film definitely has a social conscience, and wants to teach people well. I commend its success with such a difficult topic. Right after watching ""American History X"", I saw ""Monster's Ball"". The latter was not a good movie to begin with, and unfortunately it came on the heels of one of the finest movies ever made about race politics in the United States.<br/><br/>The only other complaint I have is that the film ended too happily. It is a sad movie that tries to make you feel good in the end. But that's not realistic. Edward Furlong's character, after hearing his brother's ordeal, shrugs off all his former prejudices and joins his brother's newfound doctrine of love-thy-ethnic-neighbor. The insidious influences of Cameron Alexander evaporates into thin air. I just can't quite buy it."

","American History X, when i first heard about this film i heard great things about it but being a person that has to see to believe i went to see it. When i saw it my jaw hit the floor, i never thought a film could be so entertaining as well as having a really powerful message these i thought were completely different films. Edward Norton along with Edward Furlong gave an absolutely astounding performance, to blow away even the most nit picking critic. The plot of American history x is basically the life of Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) who seeks retribution for his fathers death by joining a white power movement. This leads to a murder. Three years later Vinyard comes out a changed man only to find his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) has followed his footsteps. Derek now has a struggle to change his brother's views on the world. This is a must see movie that will leave you thinking about the world around you for a while. The performances are great the story is great let alone the brilliant cinematography."

Even with its graphic violence and language the sooner a child knows what it is really like out there the better. Norton cemented his ability that was sadly over looked by the Academy with this role. He has yet to disappoint me with his acting. I can't think of any other actor that could have pulled this off. The rest of the cast is excellent as well. Avery Brooks, Eliott Gould, Beverly D'Angelo, Ed Furlong, and Stacey Keech up to the task of bringing us one of the most riveting and important films of the last decade. One thing I found difficult to handle was the fact that I agreed with some of Derek's opinions. What he was saying was all lies. The fact that he was intelligent made this film. If he had of been just some dumb redneck then this film would not have been worth watching. The scenes shot in B&W are beautiful. Especially the one with Norton trying to cover up his swastika tattoo. This film doesn't just show us skin heads as the villains. It shows almost everyone with a prejudice. With the exception of Avery Brooks' character and Derek's prison buddy. I triumph of what a movie should be.

","American History X is certainly one hell of a movie! The plot centres around two brothers, Derek and Danny, (played respectively by Edward Norton and Edward Furlong), and the racial hatred they have inherited from their dead father. Derek is a member of a violent Neo-Nazi gang, and is eventually jailed for the murder of a black man, and whilst he is in prison Danny decides to follow in his brother's footsteps, much to the dismay of the rest of his family.<br/><br/>As you would imagine, American History X is a powerful and often brutal piece of drama, brilliantly written and directed and beautifully shot in both colour and black and white. There are some extremely violent scenes that can make this a hard movie to watch, but the violence is always relevant and never gratuitous. <br/><br/>However, the best thing about this film has to be the acting. Edward Norton is one of my favourite actors and I thought he was brilliant in Fight Club, but here he really excels himself. His performance is absolutely fantastic and the way he plays Derek as a frighteningly intelligent thug is sheer genius. As many people here have said, he was certainly robbed of an Academy Award which he thoroughly deserved to win. Although this is Norton's movie, the rest of the cast are also excellent, especially Beverly D'Angelo as Derek and Danny's careworn and despairing mother.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend this film to anyone, as it really is an absolutely outstanding piece of cinema that will certainly not disappoint. By the end you will be exhausted, shocked and emotionally drained - but believe me, it's worth it. American History X is a must-see movie."

","When I first saw this film, I didn't cry at the ending, I crumbled into a sobbing heap upon the floor.  I watched the film for the third time last night, and was once again reduced to a replica of Niagara Falls. <br/><br/>
The entire setting of the film is tense, and the cathartic ending is amazingly effective.  Hate IS a burden, as is so well depicted by this film, but what is most impressed upon in this movie is the fact that our ideas have to come from somewhere, and a family member is the most likely source. For anyone who has grown up with elder siblings, you know this to be true. From what I understand, young women grow up trying their hardest, not to be their mothers, and young men grow up trying equally as hard to BE their fathers, or someone their father will respect.  <br/><br/>The family unit is a perfect backdrop for this film.  It proves that someone is always watching how we behave, and applying it to themselves.  It also shows that our actions affect everyone around us.  No action is solely self affective, but effects everyone with whom we interact. <br/><br/>
By carrying the burden of hate, it is so easy to be impressionable, and to cling to facts that are not necessarily true, especially if they feed that hatred.  <br/><br/>I felt that Edward Norton was untouchable in this role.  He was intense and his portrayal of this character was unmistakably effective. <br/><br/>
Edward Furlong was also a natural casting choice for his character.  Both actors were superlative in this movie.  They play memorable characters and portray the conflict in such a way that you won't soon forget it. <br/><br/>
With no trouble at all, I rate this film a captivating 10/10."

This film shows the consequences that one must suffer should they decide to hold such a deep hatred for another person just because of their race, religion, sexual orientation, etc. It is also quite graphic, so should someone decide to watch it, I suggest you not eat anything while watching this movie.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie, in my opinion, is close to perfection as a film can get and I definitely recommend anyone who believes they are mature enough to view this film as it does deal with very, very, VERY mature subjects."

Although I really enjoyed Norton's performance, this movie lacks in something called...um...plot (is this a film-making trend?).  It seems to substitute dialogue for plenty of lip-smackin' violence, and it really lays the melodrama down thick. Norton's character again has two distinct faces (remember ""Primal Fear""?). He turns from nice guy to mad-dog killer, to nice guy again all within a couple of years.  How dramatically convenient.  But I like the way ""AHX"" shows the hysterical racial venom of the skinheads the way that it does, and I love how Norton can create a memorable character that has the ability to give a, sort of, guilty pleasure to the audience.  Not to mention he looks really hot in this movie - minus the swastika tattoo.  I guess what I'm trying to say is, overall, I liked this movie.

The film is stunning in its presentation of the polarisation of society at many levels and in many ways.  I believe it should be promoted in American and perhaps foreign schools to make people question and, hopefully, learn and grow.  It will also help to show socities elsewhere in the world that America is not the fairy tale land of Disney, Armageddon and 90210.  The film is accurately dark, but shines a beacon of light that through understanding, and not through confrontation, is the key to individual and social happiness.  10 out of 10 for willingness to 'look in the mirror'.  It says something about America that the director is not American.  Are American entertainers quite ready to see themselves as they are, and not as the myth tells them they are?

"Torinona","Null","0","0","19 February 1999"," Don't Believe the Hype! Potentially great film pulls too many punches...
","I did not find this movie ""amazing, poignant and powerful"" nor was it ""entertaining or enjoyable.""  However, I did appreciate it for its thought-provoking subject matter.  Alas, I think it misses the mark almost completely.  The film addresses a legitimate problem that tragically exists in our world, yet it pulls several punches in trying to ""teach"" us any kind of lesson.  From reading many of the comments here and elsewhere, the majority of audiences didn't appear to catch on to those lessons.<br/><br/>I found the ending not only disappointing in its predictability, but it virtually brings you back to the very beginning of the movie!  Black on white crime was the issue that began the movie!  Throughout the movie you are bombarded with black-on-white assaults as well as the reverse.  We have the ownership scene for the ball courts, the high school bathroom scene and the market riot scene.  And yet at the end you're left to think that the skinheads are coming for Ed Norton and Ed Furlong. I thought it would've been a far more absorbing way to end things going after ""your own kind"" and it would have made a far greater and stronger point.<br/><br/>If you allow yourself to hate one group or numerous groups, you'll eventually be consumed with that hate and lash out at even ""your own kind."" Look at the scene in which the Aryans in the prison turn on Derek when he decides to walk on his own.  Granted, he walks away for the wrong reason, his open disgust at their dealings with Latinos.  The rape scene is not only graphic in the most obvious sense, but it's graphic because it shows the conditional attitude towards ""unconditional"" love/loyalty/friendship, whether behind prison walls or on the outside.  Remember how quickly Derek's girlfriend turns on him when she sees that he's got a new way of thinking? She hates him for ""turning"" on the only ""family"" she's apparently ever known.  Where's her love for him (or her horniness for that matter)?<br/><br/>The real lesson here is NOT about how wrong it is to hate those unlike you. It's about hate, in any form.  There is a pointlessness in hate that exists no where else, in no other emotion.  Hatred and anger, while possibly legitimate feelings in a given situation, are base.  These emotions do not allow you to think.  They don't allow you to resolve or rectify the issue. Once you get past those emotions, only then can you attempt to make any change in a constructive manner.  Remember Dr. Sweeney's comments when he visits Derek in prison?<br/><br/>Derek's laundry co-worker, Lamont and Dr. Sweeney are the only characters who set out to ""actively"" help Derek in some way one saves his life, the other his mind.  Derek's sister and girlfriend are undefined.  Davina is strong enough to stand up to her brother, going after him with a bat in one scene, but her passion is given limits.  Stacy appears to be nothing more than a flaky stereotype of a young woman who can't think for herself. Derek's mother is a physical mess, incapable of helping anyone, even herself.  She's paralyzed by the fear of watching a cycle of violence and hatred that is sucking her two boys into a black hole where the only logic existing is ""blame someone else for your problems.""  And Head Racist Cameron is obviously only ""helping"" the boys to help himself.<br/><br/>The other regret I have about this movie is that due to certain graphic scenes, this movie will not be seen by younger generations who could learn a lesson, albeit a diluted one.  I was somewhat relieved to see that there wasn't an attempt to have all loose ends resolved.  This film does not attempt to answer questions, nor does attempt to say that everything in life ends happily.  Life is hard and art imitates life.<br/><br/>The cinematography is not amateurish, but it's not original either.  Ed Norton has great presence, before, during and after his ""transformation."" Ed Furlong truly stands out in a non-standout sort of way, a young man who is impressionable, adores his brother and yet has trouble speaking convincingly about his supposed hate (scene where Seth says ""Tell me what I want to hear."")<br/><br/>The film's story line is one we've seen before (Mississippi Burning, A Time to Kill, Lords of Discipline, Lone Star, To Kill a Mockingbird, even West Side Story!) and will see again, done better AND worse.  After all, we live in a country where at this VERY moment 3 White men are on trial for dragging/murdering a Black man from the back of a truck for 3 miles.  And I regrettably live in a city that not only parodied that very tragedy in a parade but where 4 white officers recently shot 41 times and killed an immigrant from Guinea with no criminal record.  This movie didn't reach me the way it seemingly reached others.  Apparently seeing movies today ranks as news as opposed to reading newspapers or listening to news broadcasts.<br/><br/>In Mein Kampf., Hitler writes ""By means of shrewd lies, unremittingly repeated, it is possible to make people believe that heaven is hell -- and hell heaven.  The greater the lie, the more readily it will be believed.""<br/><br/>Open your eyes America ""the truth is out there"" on our streets stop sitting complacently in dark movie theatres being spoon-fed ""news,"" making studios rich.  Go out into your communities and make a difference!  Don't let White children be brainwashed into thinking they're losing their ""great legacy"" to undesirables and don't let Black, Latin, Asian and minority children think that the ""white devil"" holds all the cards.<br/><br/>We must all be responsible for our own actions!  This country was built on far greater notions than making scapegoats out of one group or another!  And remember, we may all be different colors, but our blood is only one color."

This has the unfortunate effect of rendering the whole overly (and overtly) preachy. Tony Kaye and David McKenna obviously have something to say here, and they say it, but not all that convincingly. I can't see viewers applying this to their own lives, as I suspect was the intent.<br/><br/>I also didn't find the people believable. I don't think actual humans would behave like these characters, except possibly the skinheads, in aggregate. The individuals seem to be following some weird Hollywood psychology, as applicable to real life as Wile E. Coyote physics is. For instance, many people I know -- probably most -- would prefer to reign in Hell than to serve in Heaven. I don't see prison as altering this.

Kaye may have sounded both whiny (about the final edit) and ridiculous (his boast that he was ""minute for minute"" a better filmmaker than Stanley Kubrick), but he shouldn't disown the version of AHX that made it to the theaters.

"Gandalf-2","Null","0","0","28 December 1998"," A very powerful movie with a point.
","When this film was screened, I was deeply impressed. The main problematic, and this is the point in which the movie and reality are the same, is not that Nazis were bad, no, the point is the pointlessness of hate. Those young fellows who have nothing more to do with their lives than to work for the next meal and the next rent start projecting their discontent, for which they alone carry the sole responsibility, onto groups that are different from themselves. Seth, for Example (I mean the fat guy) ""kills bugs for a living"". He managed to destroy his body, he has no interest in developing, he just needs a vent to blow his discontent out into the world. I think this guy represents the average stubborn young fellow, to be found in any city, in any village, worldwide. Somebody who threw his goals in life overboard for his own comfort. Somebody who reduced his expectations in order to reach them more easily. I do not want to say that the younger generation (like me, by the way) is stubborn and uninterested, but a certain current is to be seen everywhere. But I want to point out that the big game of living, in which you lose and win many times a day, should not be taken too seriously. Blind radicalism does not lead anywhere. There are no absolute rules to anything. There is always an exception. The only thing that is final is death. And it is not up to us to determine the time of somebody's death, no matter what wrong he did. Without flexibility and therefore without active thinking and participation, nothing will work on this world. This thesis can be seen as regarding specially racial hatred and extremism as well as generally major points like political or environmental or even philosophical discussions. What we all can learn from American History X is that invading someone's privacy, doing something that is just not right (and I am sure that even the worst criminal can tell right from wrong) shall not be done. Because it is not right. Folks, show some backbone here! Mankind is supposed to be special, isn't it?"

","The nicest thing about this movie is that it illustrates the consequences and ugliness of hatred in a realistic light, while keeping humanity in perspective. Unlike some other movies on this subject, American History refrains from becoming a one-sided racial editorial. We are presented with a character whose situations lead him to a bad choice. That choice is not excused, but rather held up as an example. Sadly there is a lot of hate in America that needs to be addressed. This movie is a compelling look. Norton is impressive in the lead role, and Avery Brooks also gives a great performance."

If, however, you already know most or all of the above, you might get bored, or marvel at what a remarkably ""clean"" movie was made out of such an inherently ugly subject. Sure, the two strayed heroes have their dark sides but both of them, when they're not doing their white-supremacist gang thing, are mostly mild-mannered, well-behaved, polite kids you'd love to have baby-sit your daughter. It's no wonder then, that this dark side is so easily dropped by both at once - it didn't stick in the first place.

","No one seems to have mentioned the unusual parallels between films on gangsta culture and American History X. Did anyone here feel a little cheated when Edward Norton's character is walking down the street to see a large car with tinted windows heading towards him? It's an ending scene for Menace II Society but the only difference is that the culminating death scene is a jump-cut away. This movie is not particularly unique in that it does follow a tradition of recent gangsta movies such as American Me, Menace II Society, and Boyz N the Hood.<br/><br/>Even the homosocial narrative of men bonding with one another in the pursuit of hate and/or justice is very similar. Seth in American History X > Doughboy in Boyz N the Hood. I'm not surprised that white folks love this film for its ""realism"" as many blacks felt the same way about Boyz N the Hood or Menace II Society.<br/><br/>One does get tired of ""important"" movies about racial hatred ending in violence. I've come to think that the most radical thing a director can do with a film about racial hate is ending it with love or better yet, ambivalence. Ambivalence would imply a more disturbing idea -- that you CAN get away with hate and even better just keep on exercising low-level covert racism all your life. I find that that is more like ""real life"" in my dealings with Americans, both white and black.<br/><br/>This is not to suggest that the film is not important as I think it is quite well-done and I concur with others that Edward Norton should at least get a Best Actor nomination (personally, I think ""Happiness"" is the better film this year, though).

","One overriding them of ""American History X"" is that redemption is possible for even the worst if us. When we see Derek Vinyard as a skinhead, he seems like the most despicable type of human being, as he blames people of color for all our societal ills. His statements are so hateful and incendiary, I suspect even some racists would regard them as too extreme. He is taken under the wing of Cameron Alexander, a notorious distributor of hate literature. He is prone to fits of violent anger. As a matter of fact, even he admits his own lack of self control. All this anger, hatred, and rage explodes during that one fateful night, when he murders a black man for breaking into his car. At that point it seems he is among the damned.<br/><br/>However, prison life forces him to change his outlook. He is no longer in control of the situation. He is at the mercy of vengeful, unstable fellow inmates. One of the most chilling scenes in the film is when he is gang-raped in the shower. During that scene we are presented with the unthinkable: the viewer actually feels sorry for the character and wishes him to find a way out of his situation. Thankfully, he has a chance to do so, and is horrified to see his younger brother follow in his footsteps.<br/><br/>In some scenes we see him working in the laundry room with a black inmate. He finds himself opening up to him, even making small talk about sports. By the time he his released, so complete is his change that he seems like a new person.

","Written by David McKenna and somewhat controversially directed by Tony Kaye, this movie should disturb you with its frightening vision and at the same time entrance you with the wonderful performances. Ed Norton received a well-deserved Best Actor Oscar Nomination this year for the lead role of Derek. The supporting cast includes Edward Furlong, Stacey Keach, and Avery Brooks.  They carry their weight as the story unfolds. 	The story is primarily told through the eyes of Derek's younger brother Danny, played by Edward Furlong. At the beginning of the story Danny is in trouble yet again for writing a paper on that most misunderstood figure, Adolph Hitler. Danny is an up and coming member of the Skin-Head gang located in that area of California. Avery Brooks, appearing as Danny's principal, doesn't want to give up on the promises he sees in Danny. Instead of throwing him out, he assigns another paper to be written. This is to be on Danny's older brother, Derek, who was just released from prison that morning. Derek was the head of the Skin-Head gang that Danny is currently running with. The rest of the movie flashes back and forth from the past to the present. Through Danny's paper we see how Derek, a brilliant student, is turned into a bitter teen-ager that believes only through `white-power' will he get anywhere in life. We also see the tragic night that causes Derek to be justly imprisoned. In the present phase of the movie we encounter a Derek who has grown intellectually while in prison and will now do anything to get his brother out of the trap he allowed himself to be drawn into. 	Ed Norton is wonderful in this role. Those who have seen him in previous roles remember him to be a good actor but built on a rather slight frame. Here he has bulked himself up to be the `Aryan Superman' his character portrays. During the time frame of the movie he carries us convincingly on the journey from embitter teenager to enlightened young adult.<br/><br/>	Strong warning though. This movie well deserves it's R rating. The subject matter alone is disturbing enough. The story is also visually graphic with scenes of violence and rape. If you are prepared for something like this I highly recommend this movie. The story is extremely powerful and the performances by all are moving. I strongly recommend this one! ****"

I love the way that the film constantly puts you in the position of both Danny and Derek but especially for the end scene building us up to a shocking climax. The irony at the end is that derek had spent his teenage years full with racial hatered but changed that in prison only for that change to be countered when a black kid kills his brother This symbolises for me that perhaps you can't change and shows the vulnerability of children to their peers. overall the film highlights the frailty of relationships between inter-races and shows that a lot has to be done to take away the racial tension."

Though a tall order to fill, I have to say she more than delivered when she brought American History X over.  It was powerful, brutal, beautiful, and compelling; the last type of movie most of us college freshman typically see with friends on a friday night.

I'm not going to tell you any more than that; one of the things I enjoyed most about it was that I knew nothing more than that, so the plot was truly captivating.  Not that it cannot stand on it's own; far from it!  To tell the truth, I had absolutely no interest in what I thought would be yet another p.c. movie hollywood decides to throw at its consumers of ""Racism is the ultimate evil""; it's one of those subjects that has been beat to death, which makes Tony Kaye's (the director) job that much more difficult. However, Mr. Kaye does so in breathtaking fashion.  Much like Memento (which, of course, came after X), a great deal of the film is told via flashback in black and white.  Many of the movie's most violent and compelling scenes are set to a powerfully dramatic, classical score that would simply come off as cheesy in any other film I can think of.  What all this does is sober you up, grab your attention by the throat and make you seriously consider what this movie has to say. And what it has to say is both easily comprehensible, and brilliantly correct.  Instead of portraying all Neo-Nazis as stupid rednecks, demonic villains or unknowing pawns, Kaye creates characters with real dimensions to them.  Most people would find it hard to believe, but it isn't long after the movie starts that you actually care about two young racists, and even understand where these young men come from.  Another brilliant move by Kaye and X's writer, David McKenna, was to present the logical, intelligent arguments that Neo-Nazis use, and precisely show where exactly those arguments are flawed.  Unlike most movies, Kaye actually has the balls to show Ed Norton arguing with a teacher from school against integration, and shows him winning the argument! Another important element of this film is the reason it is rated R: horrific violence.  What is so unfortunate is that many, many people will not see this film simply because of its graphic content, yet that is what makes it so horrifying, so gripping, and so mentally lasting.  It, along with Schindler's List, is a movie that everyone should see at some point in their life; after that, you probably won't ever want to see it again."

It's high rating on IMDb is well deserved. <br/><br/>It's weak points, though few, are unfortunate -- making it a really good movie instead of a classic for the ages. Edward Norton as the Derek the skinhead who goes all the way and then sees the light was a bit too intelligent and sensitive to be fully believable. (Perhaps it was because I just saw him recently in Fight Club, and kept seeing a yuppy under the muscles and Nazi tatooos.) Avery Brooks as the black mentor I didn't like much -- he seemed to be a bit too smirky, as though he had all the answers. Also the ending was predictable and a bit overblown. In general toward the end the movie begins to lose its grip, shifting safely into the politically correct. The effect is a sense of betrayal of the gritty reality portrayed earlier. It didn't have to spell out a message -- we already got it.<br/><br/>The really standout performances are all by secondary characters: Stacy Keach as the manipulative organizer, Fairuza Balk as Derek's neo-nazi's girlfriend, Guy Torry as the fellow prisoner who helps Derek come around."

","Even though I've only seen three of Edward Norton's films American History x, Fight Club and Keeping The Faith. American History X is by far Norton's best work.<br/><br/>In History X he plays Derek a leader of a neo Nazi gang of skinheads in Venice Beach, California. After Killing two black guys for trying to steal his car he is sent down for manslaughter. While in prison he is made to work with a black man, at first he resents the man but as the film goes on he becomes really good friends with him. Also while in prison he meets another group of Nazi's who he befriends. When he see that the men in this gang are not as dedicated to white power has him he leaves them and starts playing basketball with the black cons. With this bring hatred from the nazi gang and something terrible happens. This helps to reform him and change him from a Nazi to a respectable member of society. On his release he realises that his little brother Danny (Edward Furlong, Terminator 2) has followed in the same footsteps has him. Is there enough time to rescue Danny before something bad happens?<br/><br/>American History X is not biased to any race it just tells the story of a neo nazi's reform. It has some really good arguments for both races.<br/><br/>Buy this and you'll be hooked not just by how different Norton is from Fight Club but by the acting and story. 10/10"

Tony Kaye has done such a fine job, that I must kiss his hand and worship him forever for his direction in just this one movie. He's managed to deliver a 'message', managed to keep the flow so smooth, managed to keep the story balanced, managed to tell us a very convincing story without compromising on any of the values that film has set out on. In short, he's given us one of the best movies at a time when we are fed on half-baked and good-for-nothing garbage.<br/><br/>Of course it's sad to note that some people have used the movie as propaganda machine to their own ends and the dialogues, quoted in the wrong forum, for the wrong reasons (against the very spirit of the movie). Whether or not people have learnt lessons from the movie, I hope it's definitely shaken a lot of folks and made a few THINK.<br/><br/>The acting is top class across actors and a special note of appreciation for Ed Norton's outstanding acting; it's hard to believe it was not recognized.

I did expect a certain level of didactics, which is very difficult to avoid when dealing with a complex and sensitive issue.<br/><br/>The film is not one-sided, but it is unbalanced. We hear some very powerful arguments from the fascists, and get a very strong emotional message from the other side but neither is reciprocated. We do not really see the hatred in the fascists and hear no argument against them from normal' society. What we end up with is a messed up message that says these guys may be right but hate is bad because it does not make us feel good.<br/><br/>I am  of course  simplifying, but being a cerebral person, I expect a cerebral argument. There are very good arguments against the white supremacists that can go way beyond the let's love each other because the other options are ugly' argument that was presented here. The grievances' voiced are never challenged. Are we supposed to reject the arguments just because reprehensible people represent them?

He's truly one of the greatest actors working today, and this is one of his top performances. The film itself also does an excellent job of showing Norton's character, Vinyard, as much more than one-dimensional.

","Although I totally applaud this film for its power, honesty, and riveting performances and direction, I feel I must address a greater issue at stake here.  In viewing the film for the second time two nights ago, I was suddenly inspired to find out some historical answers for myself.  Growing up in a Hindu family, I was ever surrounded by Swastikas, an ancient symbol of peace and good luck for the Hindus.  In just one hour of searching on the internet yesterday, I was amazed with the amount of information concerning the origins of this symbol, which was used by countless cultures over the world, for everything from religions to sports teams to nationalistic symbols.  That the Nazis appropriated it and (forever) changed the world view of it, in such a tiny fragment of its long history, is sad and unfortunate.  Hindus, to this day, have continued to use it as they always have - a statement of utter rejection of the Nazi regime.  History also shows the seed of white supremacy in the divide-and-conquer politics of British Imperialism. In as much that I learned in one hour on the internet - about the Swastika, the Aryans, the Indus Valley, and European ""scholars"" - I know there is a lot more to discover.  I implore everyone out there to dig a little deeper into history and find out for themselves.<br/><br/>BTW, excellent film!"

Almost every movie he has done until now, has put him in a ""nice guy"" role, where most of the time it's hard to not like him. In this film he is such an a$$ that it's hard not to despise what he believes in. While being hateful and racist, at the same time he knows exactly what he wants, and exactly how to get it. Another great performance was done by Edward Furlong. His character doesn't really know what he wants other than he wants to follow his big brother. Overall I think this is a must see for everyone that lives in America."

","This may very well be the best film I have ever seen, probably the first movie to tackle the topic of racial hatred in such a full-on way without ever once reverting to tokenism and/or victimisation of one group to make its point.<br/><br/>While the main story revolves around white supremacists Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) and his brother Danny (Edward Fulrong), racism is universal. This is a film about racism in ALL its forms and the effect it has on the people who practice and preach it and their loved ones.  This is a point summed up in Bob Sweeney's (Avery Brooks) question to Derek: ""has anything you've done made your life better?""<br/><br/>* * * SPOILER AHEAD * * *<br/><br/>The ending is fantastic, poignant and intentionally ambiguous.  It challenges you and has you thinking for days afterwards.  How does Derek come to terms with this after all he has been through?  Is this crime motivated by hatred for Danny and Derek, brought on by the actions of Derek and others like him?  Or is this just senseless racism in another form?<br/><br/>This is a movie that never lets up.  The it refuses to hide the violence but is never gratuitous or glamorized but it IS brutal - the ""put your mouth on the kerb"" scene is not Tarantino-esqe violence, but is far more disturbing. Likewise the prison rape scene.<br/><br/>The power of this film is helped no end by completely believable performances by all the principal actors.  Edward Norton, as always, is brilliant, and having only regarded Edward Furlong as a pin-up boy until I saw this film, I was blown away by his performance as the impressionable Danny.  A special mention goes to Beverly D'Angelo, who puts in the performance of her life as Doris, the boys' mother - who could believe she played another mother in the role of Ellen Griswold in the abysmal ""National Lampoon"" movies?<br/><br/>It's obvious that the actors had a real passion for the subject matter and threw themselves 110% into performances which must have been very demanding.<br/><br/>All in all, a fantastic experience for viewers who want a film which challenges them and leaves them questioning for days.  Not for those who are simply looking for entertainment.<br/><br/>Verdict: * * * * * / * * * * *"

","Edward Norton plays an absoulutely realistic and profound character as Derek Vinyard. Derek is a strong willed, intelligent and very pro-active character with a mixed up view on the realities of racism (Neo-nazi), primarily due to the deficiencies in the American system. As a result of brutally killing two afro-american youths who attempted to steal his car, Derek faces imprisonment. While in prison he experiences a different perspective which serves as a rude awakening to his wrongful hatred. This is a very strong and meaningful movie as it deals directly with the issues of hatred which are so very real in our society today. The director deals with the issue without judging between black and white, which makes this film a MUST SEE FOR ALL. Great acting jobs by the entire cast, particularly Edward Norton, who looks much fitter in this movie than in the Fight Club."

This film affects you in a way that really makes you realise just how powerful cinema as an artform can be.<br/><br/>This fable, about a Neo-Nazi who, during a stint in a particularly brutal prison, sees the wrong of his ways, is so powerful. Edward Norton as Derek Vinyard, our anti-hero, gives (for me) the definitive performance for any serious actor to follow. Travis Bickle, Harry Hill- all eclipsed. The Academy, in their infinite wisdom, chose not to award an Oscar to Norton, but one feels that here, there's the possibility that he is Derek Vinyard, and it would be wrong to give him any recognition. However, there's no ham acting here, and Norton is surrounded by a cast who never have, nor ever will produce better roles. Edward Furlong is perfect as the naive young man, idolising his brother, whilst Beverly D'Angelo plays her part so beautifully that I was wanting to put my arm around her and tell her that everything was going to be okay.<br/><br/>However, it's not, and the brilliant use of cinematography mixed with the raw energy surrounding the film  make it something that you have to see, if only because it'll be unlike anything you've ever seen before..."

","American History X is a film that looks at racism in the today's society and how it is simply a form of ignorance that has existed in this country for many years. As a minority college student I found this film to be intriguing as well as polemical because it looked at a man by the name of Derek Vinyard(Edward Norton) and how his views of other ethnicities simply changed because of an event that happened earlier in his life. Because of that as well as other family influences he went on to believe that all minorities were simply in the United States because they ""slipped through the cracks"" because some immigrants were over here in the US illegal and he also believed that they were trying to take what the ""white man"" has owned for years and that simply is not the case. Norton's character eventually becomes incarcerated and this eventually leads to his complete reformation which I found to be amazing but in the same sense it let me know that anyone can change their belief of something such as racism, they just have to want to do so first.

","When I saw the trailers for American History X, I was mesmerized.  I knew I had to see it.  Edward Norton's performance in Primal Fear was spellbinding and his performance in this film was equally captivating.  Then add in Edward Furlong's performance and you have a film that is worth the price of admission.  But it goes way beyond mere entertainment.  It makes a statement about our society, sort of like a punch in the mouth...<br/><br/>The script is excellent, the film's genre is superb, the acting is the best I've seen this year.  I hope the Academy will consider these factors and award the artists who collaborated to make this film, rather than shy away from the controversy.<br/><br/>A final note.  It's a pretty eerie feeling seeing your neighborhood on the big screen in such a vivid display of reality or driving through some of those areas after seeing this film."

","I had never seen Edward Norton befor I saw ""American History X"".  After the end of this film I realized this man has impeccable acting talent and is the next man to win an Academy Award in the near future.  He was nominated for his role in ""American History X"".  You might say this is Edward Norton's tour de force and I was so mesmerized by his performance, almost hypnotic. Don't be frightened away by Edward Norton.  This character is nothing like the actor, down-to-earth Edward Norton.  See him in other films, ""Primal Fear"" and ""Keeping The Faith"".  You will become a fan of his too.                          This film is about a Skinhead who gets revenge of the bad black men for vandalizing his car.  His little brother idolizes him.  I will not say anymore about the plot, but every person who is fed up with the neighborhood they live in and every parent who would like their teenager to be on the right path should watch this film.  Please discuss this film with your child.                                                            Skinheads, Nazi's and violent black people just is not my thing to watch in a movie, but ""American History X"" is the exception.  It is very realistic and there is a message here for all.                                             This film contains sexual situations, full frontal nudity, violence, male rape and cursing."

","I don't know how many viewers of this movie (or non-viewers who are just reading these comments) have read Anthony Burgess'""A Clockwork Orange"" with the 21st chapter, but in that chapter, it shows that it's a ""Coming of Age"" story when Your Humble Narrator, Alex, doesn't have his heart in the things he used to do anymore.  He's no longer into it.<br/><br/>If you take out the rhetoric about personal choice, then this excellently-done movie is quite parallel to that plot:<br/><br/>The surrounding story is that Edward Norton's character, Derek, was a bad guy who turned his life around in prison and is now trying to stop his brother (who idolizes him) from making the same mistakes, which gives us the premise of all the flashback scenes/Clockwork Orange plot.<br/><br/>You see all the scenes of Derek being ""not just A skinhead but THE skinhead"" and all the rhetorics he preaches that sometimes start off seemingly intelligent but always go downhill from there and ultimately into utter chaos and disorder.  Alex from ""Clockwork Orange"" is a gang leader, too, and they all go out and steal cars, beat up bums, and create other chaos and disorder.<br/><br/>In both stories, the title character goes to jail for over two years.<br/><br/>Alex in Clockwork Orange had the Ludevico Technique to ""rehabilitate"" and release him and, unfortunately for him, show him what it was like on the other end of the atrocities he used to commit.  Derek was apparently White, but while in jail, he was a ""minority"" and it was clear that without any kind of ""friends"", it meant big trouble if he was caught by his lonesome (to put it nicely).  <br/><br/>Both characters have some leader-figure to help them while they're in the slammer: Alex had the prison chaplin and Derek had the school teacher.  Both characters also have horrible things done to them by people who were once their friends.<br/><br/>At the end of it all, they are ""cured"" of what they were before jail (Although Derek didn't have to be cured of the first ""Cure"").<br/><br/>As I said, the plot is not original, but it is excellently done.<br/><br/>By the way, the ending is hugely tragic, to say the least.  So see this movie for a better version of the ""Clockwork Orange"" plot but be prepared for the ending.<br/><br/>That's a wrap."

I have been meaning to watch it forever, many's the time I picked it up in the video store only to see another film that I wanted to see and for some reason, American History X always went back on the shelf. This time though I decided to finally watch it, and I am glad that I did and annoyed that I didn't sooner. This film is unbelievable, I can't remember the last time I was unable to take my eyes from the screen, I was literally on the edge of my seat, completely entranced. At the end I was stunned, shocked you might say, this film really made me think and made it impossible to sleep afterwards (I guess deciding to watch it at 1 am was a bad idea)<br/><br/>This is an important film. First of all it gives us a real insight into the way the minds work of these white supremacists. Their completely irrational hatred. Not thinking for themselves, following like sheep because they now have a target for their anger. The way it affects the people around them and the costs involved.<br/><br/>I will give you a run down of the plot. Well basically what happens is that a young man (the ever brilliant Edward Norton) gets involved in a white supremacists group, eventually leading to him murdering two men. He goes to prison, and after 3 years he is released a changed man - only to find that his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong, and yes, it is the annoying kid from T2!) is now involved in the same group, Derek now faces a struggle to get his brother and the rest of his family away from white supremacy and convince them that hating for the sake of hating is wrong and all it does is eat you up inside.<br/><br/>Like I said, this film completely blew me away, for many reasons - The script, the direction, the message and the fantastic acting ability of Edward Norton and Edward Furlong (once you realise he can act and stop praying that Arnie will pop up and shoot him).<br/><br/>This film has real power, it carries a message, a very clear message. It's not all preachy and patronising. It carries the message over very powerfully and movingly.<br/><br/>WARNING:  You will feel drained at the end of this movie so make sure you don't operate heavy machinery :)"

The best saying is ""Skinhead - A working class movement.  Nothing more, nothing less. It really bugs me that the media always portrays skinheads as nazis when in fact they are not.

","Ed Norton has his shining achievement in the ground-breaking drama AMERICAN HISTORY X.

Though you would despise him at first (especially during his flashbacked scenes where Derek would lecture about how ""the white man is being ripped-off""), Norton amazingly transforms his character into good, realizing that everything he has done is wrong. Furlong also does a great job having that personal tug-of-war between his<br/><br/>love and admiration towards Derek, and his pride in racism. AMERICAN HISTORY X proves to be a good lesson in ethics and morality; sure, it basically feeds off the emotions of viewers, no matter what he or she thinks about our ever-changing society.

","I've seen some people criticizing this movie, mainly for plot holes. There are a couple, but nothing that takes away from the film. For those who complain that Derek's transformation was not adequately portrayed, I challenge you to consider the fact that Derek was no longer among his white supremacist allies in prison. Sure, there were pseudo-neo-nazis there... but they only added to his confusion in that they spouted only hollow rhetoric without truly believing in it, as he had. Combine that with the way he was protected by Lamont (this was a bit implausible, yes) and you may start to see why he was open to another viewpoint from his former principal.<br/><br/>One other note about people's comments: I have also seen someone criticize the film for spending too much time on White Supremacist propaganda instead of their action. I consider this myopic, to say the least. Seeing action in a movie is one thing, but knowing the motivation behind it is what makes it thought-provoking (something most directors these days ignore completely.) Many people deny that real racism exists in America anymore. The more time this movie spends giving them examples of what lines of thinking exist in this day and age, the better.<br/><br/>There is one problem I have with the film, and that involves the scene between Derek and his father. He alternates between using racial slurs and criticizing affirmative action. The message seems to be that if one is against affirmative action, one must be racist. I disagree strongly with this, as I myself am unsure of just how well that works in society. This is the kind of thinking that is the problem in the first place. Social issues like this must be examined; if you disagree, you are just as close-minded as the characters in this film. It seems like being open-minded is what this film is all about, yet this particular scene contradicts that notion."

I am curious of whether or not we will ever see the directors final cut when this movie comes out on video, I have a feeling some parts of the movie (the ending would be the first to come to mind, and maybe more to deal with the two black men Nortan killed) were better explained or had more meaning in his version.

","This could have been a good movie, if not for it's many many flaws and plot holes. 1. Cop-out edit on Norton's character escaping from the party. One minute he is running from an angry mob. A quick edit later, no mob. Total cop-out edit. 2. His gang would have known he broke ranks with the skinheads in prison when he got out. They would not have embraced him as their leader.<br/><br/>3. No one gets out of prison that early after murdering two people, one of them brutally, even if they do have the recommendation of a teacher/principle! If he would have gotten out in 10 years instead of 3, his brother would have been too grown up for the movie to work, so this was a convenient, but implausible, plot device. 4. Once he broke ranks, the black gang in prison would have killed him for what he did to get in there. There is no way the laundry boy could have prevented this from happening, if that is what we were supposed to believe.<br/><br/>5. Ridiculous score and slo-mo shots. Straight out of the Spielberg school of crap. 6. Terrible acting in some scenes, especially in the bathroom at the end.<br/><br/>7. The inconsistency of Norton's growing fondness for the laundry boy while simultaneously breaking ranks with the skinhead gang for doing business with another race. 8. No one from the skinhead gang came to pay retribution after he beat up their leader at the party, even though at least 2 of them knew where he lived. No one from the black gangs did anything as pay back for the murders either. 9. Norton's brother writing the paper serving as a narrative device. How absurd. Totally unnecessary. 10. The title of the movie. Where did the principle come up with ""X""? Was he thinking, OK, I have to teach this kid myself, so that means I put an X at the end of the subject I'm teaching? Never mind that the paper wasn't really the subject of the movie. 11. The casting of Beverly D'Angelo as the hacking mother. There was no point to her token character, and what a stupid casting decision.<br/><br/>
If this movie had been written based on actual human emotions and motivations, it would have been a totally different movie, maybe even a good one. I'm not suggesting it should have been about Norton struggling to escape gangs coming at him from every direction, though in the right hands, even that would have been a better movie than this. There are just so many ways they could have taken this, so many ways it could have been truly unique and original. Too bad it was just another piece of Hollywood garbage.

","I would imagine that this could make a very fine book because the issues that the script attempts to address are fascinating and infinitely complicated. However, in a two hour time frame it is very difficult to attempt to understand how the human mind and psyche operates as well as how family dynamics are constructed and/or break down.<br/><br/>This movie is primarily concened with the effect racism, loss and hatred have had on Daniel and Derek Vinyard. They lost their father in a racially motivated killing and the stress and tragic results this event had on their family led both of them to turn toward hate, particularly the older Derek who, under duress, vainly attempts to fill his father's shoes after his death. Derek's decision to turn toward a local skinhead organization has a significant impact upon his younger brother who is in need of a father figure.<br/><br/>While Derek is in prison he begins to try and reform his ways and through the help of a former teacher, begins to see past the intellectual and logical confines of the racial-hatred he had adopted. His experiences with skinheads in jail only further solidifies his feelings that something is very wrong with racial hatred. Without a doubt we could devote a lengthy picture to studying Derek's character development, his motivations and how his decision making leads him to the different stages in his development. This movie mistakenly attempts to both briefly accomplish this and examine the development of the younger Daniel. The two hour format does not allow more than a cursory attempt at character examination and furthermore, we find that the social tensions and racially motivated hatreds that are so prominent in these two main characters, are not evenly remotely addressed from the point of view of persons on the other side, notably minorities or other poor or lower-middle class whites struggling with similar economic difficulties. <br/><br/>The movie leaves us with another equivocal point, what about the racially motivated killing of Derek's brother Daniel. What is the purpose of this action in the story? While on the one hand racial killings occur on a regular basis and for apparently simple reasons, how does this relate to the trajectory of the story? To me it seems like a very simple and Hollywood way of ending a story that is too complicated to resolve in so short a time frame. Is this God paying Derek back? That too seems extremely sophomoric an ending, a very biblical explanation to a question that, by its very nature, is challenging conventions and demanding that those who are willing to entertain its implications, rise above simple answers and their own assumptions and prejudices. The ending is a disappointment because it does not acknowledge the very difficult and complicated causes which led to its very occurence. <br/><br/>I have to admit, I walked away from this movie feeling dissatisfied. While this was a good film with excellent acting, I must add that the script seems as though it either falls short, or loses its resolve."

Ed Furlong also gives a good show as Mr. Norton's little brother. The most disturbing thing about this movie, I think, is the fact that I found myself seeing points in what Derek Vinyard (Norton) was saying. What if Rodney King had hit a kid, then attacked the police? Would we be thinking the opposite? And what his father was saying about two white men who scored higher on the fireman's test than two black men, but didn't get the jobs because of affirmative action. Honestly, I don't support that kind of thing. If there are seven white men and three black men who have the credentials for ten top jobs, then those are the men who should get the jobs, not five men, five women, or five white men, five black women. On the other hand, if there are ten black men and women who are all more qualified, then so be it.

","Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan were amazingly powerful movies, but neither of them equal up to the power of American History X.  This film made me really think hard about the racism in America.  Some people deny that there is still racism in this country, those people haven't seen American History X.  Edward Norton is a powerhouse in this movie, nobody could have close to pulling this off as well as he did.  Un forunately, he was up against Roberto Benigni for Life Is Beautiful, for the best actor award at the Oscars.  Edward Furlong comes out of nowhere and gives a brilliant performance playing his Norton's confused brother who is caught up in the whole Nazi mess that his brother used to be part of.  In my opinion, this was the best film of the year.  It deserved nominations for sound, score, editing, cinematography, original screenplay, supporting actor (Furlong), director, and the coveted best picture award, which it should have won."

","This is a film that uses imagery to make its statements, it is not a subtle view of racism in America. The focus of the film has to do with what effect hate can have on a family.Edward Norton's performance is as powerful a performance as I have ever seen. His character is not presented as a monster, but as an intelligent kid that is smart enough to know that what he preaches is wrong, but circumstances in his life fill him with anger and hate.The movie does want to hammer home its anti racism message, to some it may seem as manipulative, but the images are so well done that it is hard not to feel a reaction. The movie would have been well served if the other characters were as fleshed out as Norton's character Derek. Norton's brother is played by Edward Furlong, his performance is good, but he is really more important as the film's narrator. The skinheads in the film are by and large shown as mindless racist drones. But I think that it is the film's point that intelligent kids like Derek is what these organizations need for recruitment.<br/><br/>The film is not subtle, it WANTS to get under our skin. Derek's eventual change of heart is dealt with too superficially though, it would have been good to focus on that a little more. Though the film is not perfect it is undeniably powerful, its best trait is that whether one likes it or not, it is a film that will cause discussion, some of the images will stay with you long after the film ends."

","Last night I sat down and watched American History X for the first time. I'm not sure why I didn't take notice of this the first time around, maybe it was the subject matter, or maybe it was the cast, i'm not sure but for some reason it eluded me.<br/><br/>After my copy of Snatch refused to play in my DVD player I decided to put on American History X and settle down for a nice quiet night in front of the television.  What unfolded in front of my eyes was the most powerful and gripping film that I have seen in recent years.  From the first minute right through to the last I was on the edge of my seat.  So what makes this film so right?  In a film so completely brilliant it is difficult to pick out one thing, but the cast and script complement each other in such a way that it is impossible to pick any holes in the film.  Norton puts in the performance of his life with Furlong providing the commentary as the film diarises the rise and fall of Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) and his influences on his younger brother.  In a film with such strong leading performances it is easy for the supporting cast to get lost in the headlights, but this is the amazing part, each supporting role (from what looks like a reunion of the Star Trek actors guild) is as strong and influential as the main ones. Avery Brooks plays the strong but subtle school principle and Beverley D'Angelo and Jennifer Lien play the Vinyard mother and sister respectively and they all turn in a real star performance.<br/><br/>The best thing about this film is that it doesn't preach, it doesn't moralise and it doesn't hold back.  At all times the audience is left to make their own judgements on the story and the characters and anyone with a soupcon of intelligence will be able to make their own mind up about the films message.<br/><br/>Since seeing this film last night I have to say it certainly ranks in my top 5 all time movies and it's a potential number one.  The sort of film that makes you want to watch it all over again just for the experience. WOW!"

","This movie stays with you...which is both a good and bad thing.  Personally, I had to rewind it and watch it again immediately after it finished.  I really wish I could have seen this in the movie theatre, but I hardly even remember it being out.  (Why it didn't do better is beyond me.)  This is one of the few movies that I've ever rented that kept me literally glued to the TV.  It's rare that a movie is capable of bringing up so many emotions--disgust, fear, awe, laughter.  Since that first viewing, I've watched this movie numerous times.  Here are my thoughts:<br/><br/>Edward Norton is THE best actor in the business.  He's like a chameleon, hardly even recognizable from role to role.  His screen presence is amazing as Derek Vinyard.  He absolutely should have won the Academy Award for this performance.  He is mesmerizing!  (Yeah, I'm a big fan.)<br/><br/>The most violent scene I have ever seen in my life is in this movie.  Forget Reservoir Dogs, Braveheart, The Cell, etc.  You'll know it when you get to it, and I still can hardly even watch it.  It makes me nauseous.<br/><br/>Minor spoilers ahead!!<br/><br/>There are two scenes in this movie that completely stick out in my mind. The first is the dinner table scene where they are discussing Rodney King. The dialogue is stellar between Norton, Gould, and D'Angelo.  D'Angelo gets kudos for the 2nd best line in the movie:  ""I can't believe that you came out of my body.""  The reason this scene is so good is because it feels so real, and you leave it feeling absolutely disgusted.  The second scene is the scene immediately following the shower rape scene between Norton and Brooks.  This scene has the best line in the movie:  ""Has anything you've done made your life any better?""  No matter how many times I see this movie, that line never feels to stir up emotions inside of me.  Yes, this movie is about skinheads, but that line applies to all of us, I think.<br/><br/>End of spoilers!<br/><br/>This is one of my all time top five movies.  I can still watch it over and over again.  I think that everyone needs to see it at least once.  The overwhelming thought that hits me every time I watch it is ""I can't believe that there are people in the world who are actually like this.""  There are, and I find that very sad.<br/><br/>Please don't miss this one!  Be forewarned, it is violent, has bad language, and is painful to watch at times.  (For subject matter, not topic.)  But it is an excellent movie."

","American History X is the kind of film that can get under your skin.  After watching it last night I found myself going over it in my head all day.  It is a tremendously powerful film that can be described as intelligent, angry, thought provoking, and at times even difficult to watch.  Edward Norton and Edward Furlong both give breath-taking performances in this story about racism and its many pitfalls.  What impressed me most about this movie is that it made legitimate arguments on both side of the racism issue forcing the viewer to realize that racism, like most major social issues, is never simply a matter of `black and white'.  <br/><br/>While my feelings against racism remain strong this movie showed me that that a person can be both right and wrong simultaneously.  One scene depicts Norton killing two black men who are breaking into his truck, the same truck his deceased father left him.  At first glance it would seem that Norton's actions are justified by protecting his family and property.  The sinister grin on Norton's face as he is arrested, however, illustrates that Norton's true motivation was hate and that deep down he had been waiting for an opportunity like that for some time.  Also at first glance it might appear that the thieves earned their punishment by breaking into Norton's truck but did the punishment fit the crime?  It is exactly that type of gray area that this film illustrates so well.    <br/><br/>Finally, the cinematography in this film was incredible.  Tony Kaye did a spectacular job with both the cinematography and direction mixing up the scenes between color and black and white.  This combined with Kaye's unique camera angles gave this movie a look and feel all its own.  American History X, only Kaye's second major project, will long be remembered as not only a very entertaining film but a very important one as well. <br/><br/>
Kaye hit a home run with this film.  From the direction and casting all the way down to costume design American History X is a very solid flic.  This movie is such an eye opener that I would suggest that every teenager in America see this it, regardless of background or where one lives.  American History X has many important lessons to teach and does so in an extremely entertaining way.  See this movie with your kids!"

Rather than that, by presenting extremity of character, this movie gives notion of safety to people.

","I saw American History X last night, and I enjoyed it very much.  The story is compelling, and the characters are mostly real.<br/><br/>The subject matter is both disturbing and thought provoking as we confront the real world struggles of a working class white family and their frustrations as they view their quiet safe neighborhood being overrun by ethnically-based gangs, while the same racial groups are given preference through federally mandated affirmative action programs.  There's a grain of truth in the hate-based movements, which is part of what makes them so dangerous; and angry invective in response does not diffuse it.<br/><br/>Edward Norton is vivid and complex in his role of a confused and conflicted teen who expresses his inner turmoil through the vehicle of a neo-nazi white supremist movement.  He succeeds brilliantly in being at once revolting in his rhetoric, frightening in his actions, yet real and reachable and still human.<br/><br/>Edward Furlong does an adequate job of portraying Norton's adoring younger brother, through whose eyes the story is told.  But his adoration is so complete that he seems uninvested in his beliefs, and the character falls short of being a real person in the movie, and seems fairly uninteresting. I think Edward Furlong has a lot of potential -- he has a vulnerability that reaches out and makes me want to care about him; but too often he comes off as unemotional, too much like a stereotypical slacking teenager.<br/><br/>It was a pleasure to see Avery Brooks (Benjamin Cisco of ST:DS9) in the role of Dr. Bob Sweeney, principal of the high school and the champion of civil rights in the film, who takes a personal interest in the boys and acts as their counselor.<br/><br/>Elliot Gould was also outstanding in his role as a liberal teacher at the high school, who has a romantic entanglement with the boys' mother, played by Beverly D'Angelo.<br/><br/>Beverly D'Angelo played the role of the mother probably as well as could be expected, but I was disappointed with the depth of character exploration they afforded her.<br/><br/>I won't spoil the end for you, but I found it to be a little dissatisfying: ironic and realistic, perhaps, but not particularly helpful to the discussion."

Never once does it suggest that being a Nazi is wrong in the cliched manner we are all used to, despite my own feelings towards the matter, the film shows that maybe there is a level of sense it what Hitler said.

","I cant believe every time I watch this movie that it didnt get a single nomination for anything.  Ed Norton deserved no less than to WIN the Oscar for one of the best all around performances in movie history. His arc as a character was incredible and Norton was outstanding in every scene, he is truly the best of any actor under 40.  <br/><br/>Frankly, the only reason I can think of for this movie not winning anything was the hoopla surrounding the directors atttempts to remove his name from this.  It must have cast a negative halo around the movie.  Kaye must be an idiot or a real egomaniac though, because this movie is out and out marvelous and this should be required reading in schools, just so people can see both sides of the race issue that is very much a problem with the youth of this nation."

","And I'm glad I did!! I went into this movie like so many other people (probably because the thought of Nazis is enough to get me me to go get a gun and be rid of these people), and, of course, I came out better for the wear. The film and the way it portrayed (kind of cut-and-paste editing) is very effective for something this real and brutal. SPOILERS, it's not going to be pretty...... It states that Derek tries to prevent his brother from becoming a skinhead soldier like he was, if anything, he's preventing him from being affiliated w/ the neo-Nazis since he doesn't want him to be marked like he was (which we see power by affiliation and it's causes), also, I'm sure Danny watching his brother curb-check a Crip (who,if you ask me, probably wouldn't have kissed the curb anyway)and then look at his expression of anger and pride when he's arrested, it tends to keep one from ever wanting to become anything that barbaric. I couldn't swallow the fact that someone like Derek would reform their beliefs after prison, but being raped by your own kind and realizing that you should look to better your life rather than your pride (also finding out that your leader is a squealer helps), would make someone wake up and change things anew (good thing I realized this in my life as well, this validates this film portraying how hatred turn one's ability to love into destruction.) My qualm w/ this film, and this does tend to happen in real life, is the fact that Sweeney asks Derek to talk skinheads out of being skinheads, especially since Sweeney understands that Derek needs breathing room for being back into the outside world, that was just plain wrong, but it also makes the ending more hard-hitting than it would've been. I say no matter who you are, check this out, but if your looking for a political agenda, I have to say I deeply symphatize w/ your ignorance. A 10!!!"

","I would place this movie in the same category as the movie J.F.K., a very well done movie but a lot to swallow.  It is obviously very biased in it's political point of view.<br/><br/>First, Derek is sent to prison for shooting armed burglars who have entered his property and are attempting to steal his truck.  One of the burglars is standing in front of the door of Derek's house with a gun in his hand while another one uses a tire iron to smash the window of his truck and Derek shoots them.  The director's intent was obviously to imply that he was wrong to shoot these dangerous armed criminals.  Is it me or are there other people out who would have shot them as well?  Perhaps he should have waited to see if they were going to use their weapons first!<br/><br/>
Then of course he meets this wonderful, caring, selfless black man while he's in prison.  Just the kind of people we all know our prisons are full of!  Sort of makes you want to go to prison so you can hang with all these great guys, doesn't it?  And of course when Derek finally gets out he's a changed man!  Hello???  Reality check???  In the real world Derek's racial views would only have been reinforced with his prison stay.<br/><br/>And if that isn't enough to show the political bias of the film maker, Daniel's teacher tells Murray that the problem started way before Derek's involvement with the white supremacists, as the movie then goes to a scene with Derek's father criticizing affirmative action, implying that this politcal view alone makes him a racist!<br/><br/>These are just a few of the many ridiculous political holes in this film.  There are many more.  I almost expected to see Jesse Jackson's name in the credits as producer or director!  While this film is entertaining and will definitely hold your attention, it is a typical Hollywood film attempting to preach typical Hollywood politics."

Very few current movies are so thought provoking.<br/><br/>I think that the comments by Tony Kaye were due more to injured pride than injured film.

"thesweetestperfection","Null","0","0","18 December 2000"," perhaps one of the most poignant films ever made
","To me film making is an art.  Countless hours of blood, sweat, and tears to create this permanent chunk of art, so to speak.  Film conveys a message unlike any other form of art.  It's visual in an almost liveable way. American History X feels like a liveable film.  Our society as a whole is quite imperfect.  Human beings are quite imperfect.  We deal with each other daily.  Some choose to live their lives to the fullest, some choose to live their lives in anger towards one another.  American History X taught me (and this is one of the things I love most about art..a person can learn more about the concept of humanity through art) that hatred will always exist. It's an unstoppable evil within our society.  If a person can learn to live their life in a positive way instead of a negative one, then there is a chance that they not only improve their own life, but the lives around them. Now that I've rambled about overly indulgent dribble, I should comment on the actual film.  Many films are made to be viewed by a certain demographic, race, sex, etc.  American History X, although the title could be seen as almost ethnocentric, is a film about society as a whole.  It's a statement about people as a whole.  Not to say that everyone is a racist, or bigot, or hypocrite or...anyway..the film is a very good vehicle for showing some of the major weaknesses people have. The viewer is shown what may go through the mind of certain people who choose to hate, simply because they're ignorant, or a product of their surroundings. It's hard to describe the power of this film if you haven't seen it. I've seen it many times, and it still takes my breath away. Edward Norton gives the performance of his career.  The other acting is strong as well. The cinematography fits the story, the mood fits the story..hell everything in this film contributes to the overall quality of the film, its message, and the way it will take its place in cinema history, not just American History, but world history."

But Those movies tend to be focused only on matters which are influenced racial discrimination.  Otherwise this film is unlike any other film.  What I felt good about this film is that this movie gives much weight to the family as well as to the racism. This film try to access the main issue(racism) from inside(family) not from outside(society). This film gives more chances to the viewer to think about racism by handling the home circle not indifferently.  The older generations like Derek's father and Neo-Nazi's lerder Cameron had the wrong ideas about racism, and these made pure young Derek turn into the extreme racialist.<br/><br/>We can see the things what the older generations should do with their young people by comparing between Cameron/Derek's father with Derek's English teacher/Derek's mother.  Those two kinds of characters show definite contrasts of the older generations in our society.  In the scene when Derek's  father was counseling about the black's culture over the table, we can realize how the prejudice can easily turn into the hatred for the people of a different color. I think that this movie shows us kind of an awareness about how much the prejudice of those people who have a power in society can bring about terrible effect on relationships between people."

To this day when I hear of hate crimes on the news I shudder and think of the scene where Edward Norton commits a brutal murder and a chill still runs up my back. Edward Norton was absolutely amazing in this movie. He managed to convey why his character was the way he was, without giving a bias to the audience. This alone is a difficult task, but then, after his reform, he allows the audience to sympathise with him, even though he was once a horrible monster. At the beginning, we are allowed to see Derek's confused views and some may even start to see their side, but slowly their side takes on a hideous insanity and we see the true evil that is hate.

Edward Furlong also gave a great and most captivating performance in this unforgettable film. Some scenes, such as the heartless brutality in the market scene was so hard to believe.

Some people say this movie is a cliche and doesn't have much of a plot. I disagree. I loved this movie, its deep, and amazing, and just incredibly smart. it forces the viewer to really think, not just watch.<br/><br/>The story portrays the events of one day, the day that Derek, a highly respected new-nazi got home from prison after serving there 3 years for a double homicide. So while Derek was forced, through extremely difficult situations and events in prison, to rethink his whole life and the ideology that has been forced upon him, his young brother Dany chose to walk the deadly path Derek chose before, the movie shows the tragic events of this family, and shows how they led to the hate and hopelessness that consumes it now.<br/><br/>This movie is about hate, and what it can do. It shows how unexpectedly it comes, and what it does. Violence doesn't have to be a way of life, and some legacies must end, for they have done much damage through their hate. Sometimes life if just unfair, and you can't undo the damage that you have done before."
"Spriggan","Null","0","0","27 October 2000"," One of the rare films that forces you to think
","This film is brilliant, not because of it's amazing plot or special effects or casting or anything like that, but because the issues that it raises are so ambiguous that it forces the viewer to reevaluate everything he thinks. The weakest points in the film are when it becomes preachy, like when it ties rational conservative thoughts to Nazi irrational hate. Also, the characters quickly destroy themselves because they change so quickly. I thought the worst part was the generally implied idea that having strong feelings is wrong, because those lead to conflict and it's pointless. Believing in something strongly but rationally is not bad, it's good, many good things have come from strong beliefs backed by reason. The real message I took from my thoughts stemming from this movie would be a reaffirmation in my mind of reason. There is a line between rational argument and irrational hate and derogatory name calling. The movie attempts to blur this line. The strongest point in the film is the fact that there is still a racial conflict in America. People are still racist, for a multitude of reasons, some old and some new. Affirmative action is a topic under intense debate, and there are no clear answers to the problems with black crime and poverty. The film is full of strong images, especially in the beginning. Derek is the strongest character, until he changes his mind in the end, he gives an intense and complete portrayal of a racist. Immediately after seeing this movie I would have given it a perfect 10, but upon reflection, this movie deserves a 9, while it did show black as well as white hate objectively, the principle and modern liberal thought was shown unobjectively. The plot had serious holes, the essay format was strained at times and the end was rushed and incomplete. By all means watch this movie and think about what it means, but remember that you are the same as Derek, that biased views can brainwash people and turn them into copies of the biased idea."

","American History X is by far one of the most memorable films I've ever seen. It stuck with me for days after the first time I watched it. The story is fairly simple. A highly respected Neo-Nazi named Darek gets out of prison and attempts to mend the damages done to his family by his hate-filled life. It's told through a mix of Darek's younger brother recalling the events leading to his arrest (in black and white) and current events just after his release (in color).<br/><br/>Edward Norton gives a fantastic and moving performance as Darek. This is one of those movies where the actor get's so into the role that you completely forget you're watching a movie. In the flashback scenes he spouts extremely powerful dialog in a manner that will make you think he just thought of it on the spot. And in the present scenes he gives an emotionally moving performance as a loving brother. Norton was absolutly robbed of the best actor Oscar.<br/><br/>The story is incredibly touching and honest, with scenes that will arise dozens of emotions in you. The manner in which the story unfolds is executed perfectly, cutting you off part way into the plot, but never leaving you confused or uptight. Each moment is just as interresting as the last. The ending leaves you with so much to think about that you'll want to see it again, just to make sure you took everything in.<br/><br/>I recommend American History X to anyone who hasn't seen it, but I'll warn that the violence and intense, and sometimes angering subject matter might be too much for some. But since the film was obviously meant to be realistic, it succeeds in every aspect. I give American History X a perfect 10 stars out of 10."
"Tom Murray","9","0","0","21 October 2000"," A study of the causes of racism.
","Man is a territorial animal. He will defend his property, often to the death. People put up fences; countries put up borders; wars are fought over control of territory. Man can, for a variety of reasons, also be nomadic. When one group of people moves into the territory of another, there will be animosity: Scottish Protestants emigrated to Catholic Ulster; Jews emigrated to Palestine and turned part of it into Israel; Europeans emigrated to America and displaced the natives. Attempts are being made to achieve some sort of reconciliation in these cases but the bitterness and hatred, caused by past revenge, make success difficult. When animosity exists between different races, it is called racism but it is no different than when the two contending groups are of the same ethnic background, as with the Scots and the Irish: both Celtic. It only matters that the two groups perceive of themselves as different in some way, even in ways that others would consider insignificant. American History X is about the racism created when blacks moved into the white Venice Beach section of Los Angeles. Derek's father was murdered by blacks and he desires revenge. He joins a Neo-Nazi group and becomes a highly respected leader. His opportunity for revenge comes when three blacks attempt to steal his car; he viciously murders two of them. Lack of witnesses allows him to escape a murder conviction and he spends only a few years in jail. During that time, he becomes disillusioned with other Neo-Nazis in the prison and he leaves them, and their protection. Miraculously, the blacks leave him alone, because he has befriended one of them, partly because of the influence of a black teacher, whom Derek respects, and who is always working for reconciliation and partly because his black friend accepted him, right from the start. This friendship causes him to abandon his hatred of blacks and feel remorse for his acts. When released from prison, Derek finds that his younger brother, Danny, has become a member of the same Neo-Nazi group and Derek attempts to free him from their influence. However, past actions have already made tragic events inevitable. The film is very intense. It left me feeling emotionally exhausted but very glad to have seen it and wanting to see it again. The acting is superb; the writing is very powerful; the characters are well developed and we care deeply about what happens to these two brothers. The central premise of the film is that reconciliation, however difficult, might be possible, if we strive for it diligently and with understanding."

A difficult and controversial subject matter handled superbly by director and writer alike.  Top class performances by Edward Norton and Edward Furlong (who has matured brilliantly since T2) manage to elevate this superb film into a masterpiece.  I cannot speak more highly. 10/10"

","This movie is absolutely fabulous! I can't describe the way i was feeling after seeing this, i was speechless, the only thing i could say to everybody was «My God, this movie is amazing!», i was shocked and stunned and touched and everything at the same time.<br/><br/>It's amazing how a director like Tony Kaye and a writer like David McKenna made such an amazing movie in their debut in the movies scene. I found out this when, after seeing the movie, thought to myself «I have to see other things from this guys...» and, to my surprise, didn't find anything!<br/><br/>One of the things that made me like this movie very, very much, was Edward Norton. He is, without any doubts, the best actor of his generation, and his role in this movie wasn't easy, but he made it perfectly. One of the strongest sequences of the movie is when Derek is being arrested, he is the personification of hate itself. There are two things that you should consider in Edward's acting (and they're both perfect), the first is his acting as a skinhead, he really makes us to think that he is in fact a skinhead; the second is his redemption, especially starting from when he is raped in jail, from that moment he begins is change into a different man.<br/><br/>The other actors also have good performances, but we must be real, Edward Norton makes them small with his greatness.<br/><br/>The end of the movie is also an amazing thing, and that's beginning to be something rare in these days, movies are starting to be predictable.<br/><br/>Certainly one of the best movies of all times...<br/><br/>10/10"

","Let's start by saying that Tony Kaye, the director has made one hell of a picture. Technically, the guy is fantastic, beautifully shot. The black and White photography is the best I've ever seen in a modern film. The opening credits are amazing, I can't believe how fantastic it looked.<br/><br/>
Tony Kaye has disowned the film but I hope he'll look back and see what a technical achievement AHX really is. This is a director and cinematographer who has bags of talent, someone's skills I certainly admire. I don't think there's too much wrong with this picture, whatever happened behind the scenes, this is a terrific film.<br/><br/>The film is all too real about our society today, the hatred, one has for another race because their own life has nothing to offer. The racism in the film is born out of frustration, passed down from parent, blaming other races for their own predicament. <br/><br/>The film tells the story of a racist who is used and abused by his very group, neo-nazis are here because other people who orchestrate such hatred want power, they use everyone else to do their dirty work, this film shows it very well. Does hatred make the racists live a better life? NO, they are still frustrated because they are fighting an endless war.<br/><br/><br/><br/>If there is a critism of the film, it's cliched in the middle and the finale is disappointing. The film required another 20 minutes to give Ed Norton's breathtaking performance more meat in the middle.<br/><br/>The acting is fantastic, everyone was worthy of praises.<br/><br/>Technically, the picture is perfect, shame the director doesn't feel that this is his film, albeit not his ideal cut. Every director should have the last word on his/her film.<br/><br/>Overall, a fantastic picture but some disappointing cliche moments and the point of view is too one-sided."

"shamsee","8","0","0","24 August 2000"," Good Movie
","I will give this movie an 8/10. It did a good job of tackling and explaining tough issues. It also showed how little incidents just become excuse for venting built up anger. It also showed the power of love, especially power of mother's love, love between two brothers, and love of a teacher to rescue students, perfectly. Mother's character and the scene where the argument turns into a fight was just too powerful. When mother is shown battling poverty as  well by sacrificing comfort for her kids, it moved me to tears. Also it shows that sometimes one good person, like the black guy in prison who becomes a friend to the main character, his niceness and attitude changed that man's life and saved him. Just imagine if that character had his own problems and rage then what would have happened. It also showed how foolish and shallow people associated with hate-groups really are and how it is an expression of their other problems.<br/><br/>Despite all those power, moving, and terrifying moments, the liberal director and writers missed the point of their own movie. The movie that is supposed to be warning to those who hate and is supposed to show power of love and ability to overcome rage, and as a matter of facts wants to be a guide for people struggling with those issues, itself engages in demonization and unfair characterization, which will hurt the feelings of those who are being labeled and cause a rage to built up in them, a result opposite of what this movie should have and hopes to have.<br/><br/>Is it really fair to describe opposition to Affirmative Action as a first step towards becoming a skin-head? That's what movie seems to be suggesting. Good people can agree on the issue and on ideas how to help those who need help but demonization of the extremely large portion of the population is hardly useful. Also the skin head is shown to use the words 'Democrat' and 'Liberal' as curse words. Yeah, that's fair, and that should really bring people together. <br/><br/>It is sad that those who made the movie about overcoming anger and rage could not control their own negative feelings and had to demonize innocent people.<br/><br/>In any case see this movie, if for nothing else, to see a mother's love and sacrifice."

","Before I actually watched American History X I had the impression that the film was about white-supremacist groups in America, and the moral vileness of inequity. (Needless to say, it was a while before I got around to watching it.)<br/><br/>I was wrong.<br/><br/>Aside from the brilliant casting, the subtle, but evocative cinematography (no showing off, no intellectual snobbery), the plot of the film was simply stunning. Instead of dealing with racism, and gang politics in the overdone manner of every other film out of the US that even mentions gangs, this took you right inside the heads of Derek and Daniel Vinyard. I have not seen a film made since A Clockwork Orange which has so successfully subverted what you think you know, to make you see something in a different light, and sympathize with a character you were initially repulsed by. (I'm not saying there haven't been films like this, it's just I haven't seen them).<br/><br/>There are very few films that I feel deal with any subject fairly, and I think this one managed. To top it off American History X was superbly acted, with all the actors becoming their roles, rather than simply playing them. It's hard to picture Fairuza Balk as anyone other than Derek's violent girlfriend, or even Eddie Furlong as anything other than Daniel Vinyard. Ethan Suplee did an amazing transition from the kind of film one usually catches him in (Mallrats - as Willim, and other comedies), to being a truly frightening character (Seth). And Edward Norton. How can I not rave on and on about this guy? All I can say is that I was totally blown away by his portrayal of Derek Vinyard. Compare this to the Narrator in Fight Club, and you'll see what I mean. You'd never even know it was the same man.<br/><br/>As a rather un-intellectual end note...If you're not an Edward Norton fan yet, I suggest you don't rest until you've seen some of the strikingly different characters that he is able to portray in such a manner that it is very difficult to recognize him as the same person."

","Title: American History X Rating: R Director: Tony Kaye New Line Cinema<br/><br/>Rating: 8/10<br/><br/>American History X is the tale of a Skinhead member, Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton.)  Vinyard progresses to the top a local skinhead movement in their city, Venice Beach, California.  One night three black men try to break into Vinyard's car.  When Vinyard finds out that there are three black men outside trying to break into his car, he finds his gun and runs outside killing two of the three men.  Norton is arrested and spends the next three years in jail.  Vinyard's younger brother, Danny (Edward Furlong) follows up in his brothers footsteps and joins the group while Derek is in jail.  Upon Derek's release from prison he is shocked and disappointed when he finds his brother in the group.<br/><br/>American History X is an excellent film based on the story of a racist man and his family.  I have never seen Edward Norton in a role like this.  It is fantastic!  He does an excellent job at portraying his character.  The film starts in black and white, a flashback.  The film then progresses to color, the present, and flips back and forth between the two.  The flashback sequences are done really well, and placed at appropriate spots.  The directing of this film was also done really well.  American History X surfaces racial issues and does a great job at portraying their reality. When the movie was finished I didn't feel too happy, but that was not the film's purpose.  Kaye did a fantastic job at pushing through the emotion that he wanted the viewers to get.  I think that American History X, though disturbing, and hard to watch at points, was an excellent film the whole way through.<br/><br/>Has anything you've done made your life better?<br/><br/>

","I am completely dumbfounded as to why I'm seeing all of these comments summarizing this film as, ""Best film of 98'"", ""Powerful"", or ""Oscar worthy film""; please, the only oscar worthy aspect of this film is Edward Norton's performance! I mean AMX is a strong gripping film, but we aren't exactly talking ""Citizen Kane"" here.<br/><br/>The plot is pretty mediocre: The prodigal son returns to keep his younger brother from following down the same tracks; but will he succeed? Well, I'm not going to spoil it for those who're still out of the loop, but suffice to say you can see the arbitrary ending coming halfway through the film. The moral? Everyone knows the moral of the film even before the opening credits roll: ""Hate Kills!"" nuff said.<br/><br/>Many of the conflicts involving minorities appeared to have been shoehorned. For instants, there's a sequence here where trio of trouble makers pay a late night visit to Norton's place to seek revenge on a lousy basketball game of all things. On top of that, all of the blacks (with the exception of Avery Brooks' character) were portrayed in the worse possible light: jive talkin', foul mouthin', chest-thumping all the way through. I guess this was to give Norton's crew and every other closet racist out there justification for their twisted ideals, ""You see Martha! you see how they act!""<br/><br/>As earlier mentioned, performances all around were rather good, however, Jennifer Lien--despite her good performance seemed out of place. I don't know... I can't quite put my finger on it, but she was rather out of sync with the whole trailer trash family unit (that's a complement by the way).<br/><br/>Rating: 6"
"Benzzo","8","0","0","17 June 2000"," Gripping and thought-provoking
","I've been wanting to see this film since it first came out.  What took me so long to get around to that, I don't know, but I'm glad I gathered myself to experience the occasion.  First and foremost, Ed Norton has reassured me that he is probably the best male actor of his generation.  It's a stunning performance, it's almost like a floating camera followed a real skinhead through life and in prison and we get to see how he acts.<br/><br/>I was glad to find out that this wasn't a movie like Higher Learning where the students had all sorts of racial tendencies for no apparent reason at all, and were so extreme about it.  I mean, come on, have you EVER seen a college campus like that?  But not American History X, the story is always intriguing.  What's best about it is how it shows how there is a false sense of security in numbers.   Many of the blacks and whites think they'll be all right hanging together as long as they don't get killed, but little do they know that their lifestyle is progressively leading them to destruction every day they band together in hate.<br/><br/>But what kept this movie from being the greatest of its genre are some of its forced moments.  A few come to mind right away.  One is when the skinheads plan a party for him the day he gets out of prison.  He tells a select few that he has changed and he wants out.  This leads to a scuffle with one of the members and results in Seth (the fat guy) to pull a gun on Ed Norton.  Ed's girlfriend, who was elated to see him and was in love with him before he was locked up just yells ""Do it!  Shoot him, Seth!"" without really knowing what was going on.  The other is the whole idea of how Derek (Ed Norton) got to be a skinhead in the first place.  He is very happy to be under the teaching of a black principal at his high school, but when his dad puts doubt in his mind by siting affirmative-action at his job we don't really get to see how it festers into full-blown racism.  Somehow I don't believe that most white kids whose father was killed by blacks in a non-racially motivated way would tattoo a swastika on their chest and start a white revolt.<br/><br/>Still, I am recommending the film for its captivating qualities and the acting performances of not only Norton, but everyone else in the film.  The style is great, color to show the present and black and white (which is probably symbolic in some sort of way) to show the past.  This film is definitely one of the better race relations movies I've seen.<br/><br/>*** (out of 4)"
"Tresy","Null","0","0","11 June 2000"," Powerful, but flinching
","Well before ""American History X,"" back around 1990, I heard a real-life Derek Vinyard interviewed on radio. This articulate, former white supremacist had, like Derek, come to reject his racist  beliefs, and like Derek he had devoted his life to trying to make amends for his past by addressing youth and other at-risk groups. Unlike Derek, however, his analysis did not stop with platitudes about hate being bad, or even denunciations of white supremacist corruption and hypocrisy, as Derek comes to espouse. He contextualized his former life.<br/><br/>When his fellow supremacists went out recruiting, he said, they did not go straight to overt racialist appeals. Instead they took advantage of the demagogic spadework begun by Pat Buchanan, Newt Gingrich and their ilk, and played the coded race cards of ""affirmative action"", ""quotas,"" ""busing"" and ""urban crime."" He and his fellow supremacists knew exactly what the subtext of this rhetoric was, and they frankly appreciated the help given them by their ""respectable"" allies in Washington and the media.<br/><br/>It's too bad that this movie did not have the guts to make a similar connection with the larger political framework that Derek's prototype saw so readily. True, we do get a scene in which Derek's father fulminates in barely coded terms about affirmative action, and the anti-hate pseudo-strategy of film's token hapless liberal (well played by Elliott Gould) consists solely of a knee-jerk PC censorship reflex (ignoring the famous dictum about sunlight being the best disinfectant).<br/><br/>But these glimpses into the larger sustaining milieu of white racism fall well short of helping audiences confront the continuum between overt racism and the ""respectable"" politicial rheteoric that  feeds it. Instead, it is suggested through Derek's brother Danny that nice communities like Venice Beach just decayed passively as gangs moved in. Is it too much to expect some passing mention of decades of malign political neglect of our urban centers? Of a deliberate, decades-long widening of the gap between rich and poor, with the predictable (and frankly, intended) effect of pitting economically insecure lower-class whites and blacks against one another in a struggle for shrinking slices of the economic pie? Of the concomitant shredding of the social safety net?<br/><br/>I don't think so. Other movies have explored the class-based terrain of race hate in a gripping fashion; ""Blood in the Face"" comes to mind. It's necessary, but not enough, to show us the redemptive power of forgiveness, as ""American History X"" does. (In an inspired symbolic moment of levity, Derek first breaks through his prejudices as his black prison co-worker, mimicking sex between two lovers who have just had a spat, pants orgiastically, ""I forgive you, baby! I forgive you!!!"") If change is going to come about, it must begin with making audiences feel uncomfortable with their own unexamined assumptions and prejudices. And that, by and large, this movie fails to do.<br/><br/>Nonetheless I share the general critical consensus that the performances in the film are first-rate, and the story expertly told. The elegiac score adds an affecting emotional dimension to the movie as well, perhaps suggesting, where the movie otherwise cops out, the sense of America's promise lost. And the film's tragic ending, while unconvincing to some, demonstrates the realization that our actions can have far-reaching repercussions beyond our control. On a purely dramatic level, the movie succeeds.<br/><br/>However, AHX failure of nerve only helps guarantee that we have not seen the end of any further need for films like it in the future. And that's the real tragedy."

","To tell you the truth, I am surprised that a movie as powerful and sobering as this and dealing with the subject matter that it does, is done by a studio.  It's intricate in its protrayal of white supremecy and the form of the plot is masterfully done, as is the acting, and cinematography.  But for all its power and logic, there are intricacies which get overlooked.  The dialogue, for instance is somewhat unrealistic in its blatant disregard for subtlety.  I think when the director and writer were looking over the subject matter they tried to make it very blatant, but at the same time inadvertently forced the dialogue to become a say-all for what was going on in the story or scene. Unlike most people I think Edward Furlong did a wonderful job playing Danny and it was the script that called for the quick change of attitude.  I really think the director and writer show budding talent, but that talent needs to be refined more.  Still, this movie should at least be nominated for best picture along with Edward Norton being nominated for best actor."

I thought this film would be idiotic, but in fact, it does succeed in addressing a number of issues (from immigration to affirmative action) in such a way as to illustrate how a reasonably intelligent adolescent could be lured into the Neo-Nazi movement.  Still, there's almost an implication that anyone who doesn't support affirmative action or who does support tougher immigration laws is one step away from being a through and through bigot.  There are indeed shades of gray that exist between black and white.  American History X fails to find these shades, and instead rests comfortably in extremes.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, the violence is pretty graphic.

You should have put your differences aside with Ed Norton and New Line Cinema and just sat back and raked in the accolades you would have received from it. You would have been one of the hottest directors around. This film is almost without peer in its genre."

","I'll keep this short and simple.. American History X is an amazing film.

Beautiful at times.. It's unfair to say that Spielberg could have done a better job.. This was Kaye's film.. Not Spielberg's.

","""American History X"" is one of the most controversial films of the 90's. Yet it is filmed beyond well and goes past the limit of what most people usually expect, kinda like ""The Deer Hunter"", ""Boyz 'N the Hood"",""Reservoir Dogs"", ""Schindler's List"", ""Pulp Fiction"", or ""Saving Private Ryan"" might of when they first came out. The controversial race themes are presented so that most, not all, people can appreciate their disguised messages. It's one of those movies that's against a certain form of rebellion, and shows it by presenting the results and points of view of that rebellion, kinda like ""Born on the Fourth of July"" or ""SLC Punk"". Edward Norton took on a role that most actors wouldn't of even considered looking at and did the best with it. The final result was a well earned Oscar nomination. Guy Torry, Edward Furlong and Stacy Keach all gave worthy supporting performances as well. If you're going to watch this film, have an open and understanding mind. Otherwise, feel free to avoid a rather offensive and violent movie."

"mic check","8","0","0","11 May 2000"," X marks the spot
","So much is being written about the battles between New Line Cinema and Director Tony Kaye over his debut feature film that hardly anything is being said about the film itself. That's too bad because American History X, despite a few hiccups, is an intense, tautly written, and beautifully lensed trumpet song heralding the arrival of a formidable new talent.<br/><br/>
Danny (Furlong) is an impressionable youth who greatly admires and looks up to his brother Derek (Norton). Trouble is, Derek is the leader of an organized skinhead group. One evening, Derek goes on a rage and murders two black men. Three years later, on the day of Derek's release from prison, Danny turns in a book report on Mein Kampf and lands in the principal Sweeney's (Brooks) office. As punishment, Sweeney demands Danny rewrite the paper tracing his brother's path to murder. Told partially in flashback American History X, grapples with serious issues of hatred, racism, and whether or not such deep-seated resentment can be turned back.<br/><br/>Kaye directed commercials for Volvo, Volkswagen, and Nike (not to mention Soul Asylum's award-winning ""Runaway Train"" video) and much of the film features commercial-like moments: long lingering camera sweeps, plenty of slo-mo, light bursts, and inspired camera angles. Kaye manages to capture some memorable images. Still, despite this, at some points it gets a little tedious. Some of the emotional impact is washed away from certain scenes simply because the camera just won't stand still.<br/><br/>Another wonderful surprise is the crispness of the black and white footage Kaye shot. Like Pleasantville, after extended periods of black and white, when color does reappear, it seems all the more vibrant.<br/><br/>Maybe Kaye's version would have addressed this but the picture does have its share of problems. Will working in a prison laundry alongside a chummy black guy really change such deep-rooted hatred and fear in Derek? Wouldn't the skinheads attack Derek after his release from prison and beating of the white supremacist leader? Did his mother have to be sick? Couldn't we have seen a little more struggle from Danny trying to ditch his extremist ways other than just crying on his brother's shoulder? Did we really need to see another prison rape scene?<br/><br/>Despite a mixed bag of problematic moments and inspired genuis, American History X is worth your time if for no other reason than to check out Norton and Furlong's taut performances. Norton never looked so menacing, nor showed such a proclivity toward evil doing. Avery Brooks, Fairuza Balk, and a surprisingly effective Beverly D'Angelo also turned in some nice (if uneven) performances.<br/><br/>It's unfortunate that Kaye feels like he was unable to complete American History X. Much of the film feels great but there are moments of stumbling about. Perhaps Kaye would've fixed those. Or, maybe not. In any case, the ultimate message is diluted because of the inconsistencies. This is one of those tricky flicks you'll either love or hate and that is part of its charm."

","I was really moved by this picture. I had gotten so attached to the characters by the end, you can guess what happened to me at the climax of the movie (TRYING not to insert any spoilers :) ) But really, I know a few people who hate blacks (there's this one girl in Texas, but I won't go into details as to why SHE is a racist) and they NEED to see this movie. They won't like it, but they will be changed by it. The only scene that proved offensive to me was the (OK, so I couldn't avoid a LITTLE spoiler) ""Derek was anally raped"" scene. But they did handle it very well, the way he walked the next day gave the impression that he had been violated in that way. That one scene is the visualization of all straight men's nightmares about prison, btw.<br/><br/>Anyway, as my summary puts it, racists must see this movie, and though they might not like it, they will be changed. I myself am not a racist. I mean, I wasn't BEFORE I saw the movie and I know I'm never going over to that side. This movie only reaffirms that belief. I love it as a movie as well; to see Edward Furlong (I own T2 btw) is a real treat, and I was surprised to see Jennifer Lien of Star Trek Voyager fame. All in all, a great movie and again, a must-see for racists."
"Andrew-162","8","0","0","7 May 2000"," Norton makes it happen
","American History X only got one oscar nomination: Best Actor, Edward Norton. He lost to the tour de force performance of Roberto Benigni in ""Life Is Beautiful"". Whether Norton deserved it over Benigni (I hope that is the right spelling) is a question worth debating, both were career-making performances. I think that Norton probably deserved it a little more for 2 reasons: 1. He plays COMPLETELY against type. You can not believe that this is the same relatively tame Edward Norton who won so many people over in such movies as Rounders and the People Vs. Larry Flynt. Rarely are there such acting transformations. 2. Norton carried the movie. The direction was somewhat sloppy, the script had a couple holes here and there, and besides Furlong's convincing peformance as an impressionable youth, the acting is only so-so. But Norton was solid, convincingly ranting and raving and recruiting. The slow transformation of Furlong's character into a neo-nazi under Norton's influence and then the transformation back to tolerance truly exemplifies how the Nazi movement could have spread through Germany over 60 years ago. The movie is definitely worth a watch. Some heads may be turned by it, even."

","In the age of three hour movies I wish this had been.  In the just two hours the film did not develop some of its most im- portant story lines.  I wanted to see more development of Derek's move away from Neo- Nazi ideals and Danny's move towards. This may have served to give more meaning to the final scenes and made them seem less contrived and routine.  It may seem I did not like this film, but, in fact, I wanted to see more--more character develop ment, more dialogue between the main char- acters, more transitional scenes--just more!  On the positive side this is probably the most important movie of the year and is a ""must see"".  I particularly liked the cinematography.  The black and white flashbacks and the great number of close-up face shots were great.  They set the mood for the film as both dark and intense. The honest presentation of political and social problems that face the country in the late 20th Century is laudable.  Mr. Norton portrays a convincing, sometimes loathsome but sometimes very human even likable skinhead.  His journey to and from these ideals and the relationship with his younger brother, Mr. Furlong, make this a most compelling story.  Mr. Norton's performance is worthy of best actor consideration in his successful portrayal of this complex character.  I would emphasize that this film is not for the squeamish or faint of heart, but it is brutally (in all senses of the word) honest, and if you don't leave the theater thinking and/or talking then I suggest a brain scan.  Once again thanks to Mr. Norton for an outstanding performance.  Four stars for his performance and the topic even though it could have used a more (see above)"

It reminds me, in some ways, of Oliver Stone's Talk Radio (another great film). Here is a guy with some real pain inside and is looking for an outlet. Well, he finds it with the help of Stacy Keach's character and it would have been interesting to see their initial encounter. This movie succeeds where lesser attempts (like Higher Learning) fail, probably because the film treats all of its characters, racists and non-racists alike as people (not an easy thing to do) and not just cardboard racial or social stereotypes. The dialogue is tremendous. I don't know why people here seem to have trouble with Derek's laundry co-worker, his dialogue is really so much more than simple jokes.

In jail he is forced to meet and be acquainted with minorities he hated too much to know. when he's released, he comes home to find that his younger brother his headed to the same fate as his and tries to stop him. now, this basic subject has been executed to motion pictures in all kinds of versions such as Rob Reiner's ghosts from the past but unlike that movie (which is pathetic, if i may say so) this movie tries to deal with the basic cause of racism instead of merely explaining it by the nature of southern yahoos that usually have the I.Q. of algea (according to reiner et al) finally, I would like to salute Edward norton who, if not tempted to play in mediocre hollywood films, is bound to be the next Al Pacino (i didn't say De-niro because he deteriorated so badly that i can't even talk about it). summing up: rent the movie justify your movie freakiness or at least remind yourself why you became one in the first place."

Someone pointed out before it seemed amateurish, but I disagree. This was a good, thought-provoking film.  It showed where racists get their beliefs and just how crazy something out of control can become.

","American History X is an undeniably breathtaking viewing experience. Nevertheless, it left me with certain reservations regarding the message presented. Each racist argument presented during the movie is delivered with considerable detail, feeling and conviction. The anti-racist argument, on the other hand, relies solely on the presence of a couple of sympathetic black characters, a whole load of despicable white ones, and no real equivalent intellectual basis. Whilst it is hopefully correct to assume that the viewer doesn't take much convincing to be repelled by Nazi ideology, this is surely not enough to justify Danny's inevitable and immediate transition from swastika-worshipper to peace-n-love merchant.<br/><br/>This movie is far from racist. Scenes such as the hard-to-watch humiliation of a black supermarket check-out girl or the shock ending ensure this. However, I wish the director had put as much energy and vitality into his portrayal of Derek the changed man as he does Derek the charismatic, MTV-style neo-Nazi. <br/><br/>A flawed masterpiece, perhaps..."

","Edward Norton probably deserves a Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal of Derek Vinyard, a reformed neo-Nazi skinhead who is trying to keep his wayward younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) from making the same mistakes.  After excellent work in `Primal Fear' (1996) and `Rounders' (1998), Norton continues to deliver stunning portrayals of men of questionable character, much like Robert DeNiro has throughout the past generation.<br/><br/>This provocative film, with able direction and slick black-&-white-&-color cinematography by Tony Kaye, hurls you into the world of the Venice Beach, California, skinheads and the rest of the working class whites who feel pressured by the influx of black families escaping the battlegrounds of South Central Los Angeles.  Kaye's willingness to examine the Vinyard family with an unabashed eye recalls John Singleton's unerring portrait of Furious Styles's household in `Boyz N the Hood.'  As a matter of fact, I would recommend `Boyz N the Hood' as an ideal companion piece to `American History X'<br/><br/>`American History X' depicts some pretty explicit things, including rampant profanity, rape, violence, and sexual intercourse.  But this film avoids lurid exploitation, and shows a judicious hand.  It is not something to take your Grandma to, unless you're Adam Sandler.<br/><br/>This movie utilizes young actors and veterans alike.  Avery Brooks (Principal Bob Sweeney) and Stacy Keach (neo-Nazi Cameron Alexander) are the father-figure idealogues tugging Danny in either direction.  Beverly D'Angelo delivers her best work in years as Doris, the Vinyard boys' mother. In their efforts to help Danny, his social studies teacher (Elliott Gould) and his sister Davina (Jennifer Lien) are countered by corpulent skinhead Seth (Ethan Suplee) and the parasitical Stacey (Fairuza Balk).  And it is in this delicate balance that writer David McKenna constructs a disturbing and magnificent story that, until the end, preserves the chance of ending in either tragedy or triumph."

","As you watch Ed Norton in the role that garnered him a nomination for best actor, you realize that you are watching acting of a caliber that hasn't been seen since the glory days of Marlon Brando and the early works of Robert DeNiro.  Norton virtually vanishes into this role.  He is scary.  With the shaved head, bulked up physique and tattoos dotted across his torso, he comes across as truly menacing.  The real strength in this role comes from Norton's convictions.  When he rallies his fellow white supremacists into a raid on a grocery store, you believe him.  Then when he returns from prison, you see a totally different person.  You see the pain and sorrow that has cost him three years of his life.   When Norton looks into the mirror and sees the giant swastika emblazened on his chest, you see in his eyes a look of regret.   Edward Furlong is also good in the role of the younger brother who is headed on the same path of destruction that his older brother was on.   All the performances in this film are top notch. The film is hard to watch at times.  The violence and the hate mongering that Norton perpetrates is tough to stomach, but in the end, Norton's character is redeemed.  He has seen the error of his ways and he hopes to keep his brother out of the life that took so much from him and his family."

Oh how I was wrong (for the first part). Two hours later, my friends and I had experienced a superb piece of modern day filmmaking. Edward Norton gives the performance of a life time, eclipsing what I had only seen him in before in Fight Club.<br/><br/>The film is a very powerful, moving, and extremely shocking piece of viewing, although certainly not for the faint hearted.

Being famous for playing John Connor in T2 back in 1991, he has certainly grown up and gives a performance almost as powerful as Norton.<br/><br/>I certainly reccomend this film to anyone who appreciates fine acting, and powerful filmmaking.

The scene where he kills one of two black car thiefs, the look on his face as he walks away from the dead body is enough to send chills up and down your spine.

"JackSlims","8","0","0","7 January 2000"," With a closed mind, there is no other perspective than one's own.
","Narisicism is ingrained in human nature.  People's love for themselves often leads them to bond with others who are most similar with them.  This lack of diversity of thought lends members of such a group to believe that their paradigm is the true or correct way to view the world.  American History X portrays these feelings excellently.  The neo-Nazis began simply as angry young men who were scared in the world which they lived.  They found solace, and soon ignorance, in the company of fellow men who, in one way or another, held similar feelings. This comfort which grew from the mass quickly bottlenecked its members' ability to empathize.  People with different perspectives were not only ignored but seen as the enemy. narrower and narrower mindset soon set in, eliminating the ""big picture' completely. AMX's use of this theme was magnificent.  I hope that those who see this film enter with an open mind and leave with a heightened sense of the world around them.  Even for those where racial inequality is not a factor in their life, this movie still offers insight.  Ignorance to the feelings of fellow human beings can be found in the smallest of daily activities.  Open your eyes, take a step back, and look at the world from the shoes of another. You'll be surprised at what you see."

The film suggests that it is also the kind of place that might breed extreme right wing reaction to the inflow of other races. The protagonist here is Derick (Edward Norton) a bright young man whose life has been blighted but the murder of his father, a fireman, while fighting a blaze in a black ghetto.

But the past will not let him go, and the cycle of violence goes on.<br/><br/>A gloomy story, but honestly told. A good proportion of the film is done as flashback, in black and white, adding to the austerity of the story. There are some interesting suggestions bound to upset the politically correct, for example that affirmative action is counter productive, that prison might actually have the desired effect on some people, that education is an inadequate response to racism amongst the young, and that some neo-nazis might be idealists, not just thugs, and hence be far more dangerous."

There's an annoying tendency in movies lately to try and build drama with slow-motion photography and/or music from the soundtrack in painfully obvious ways. (""Does everyone understand this is a dramatic moment""? {music crashing in the background, people running in slo-mo}) AMX falls into that habit occasionally and deserves a few demerit points for it.<br/><br/>But forget all of that and watch the actors. All of them did an excellent job in this film. Norton is definitely the star of the show and deserves the praise he has received. The hateful gleam in his eye as he's being arrested was almost messianic. I also thought Avery Brooks did a fine job with his role, which all in all was too brief. He should have gotten more screen time.<br/><br/>Another plus for the film was that it usually didn't pull any punches. I mean, if you're going to look at the hateful, violent side of life, look at it. It also didn't get overly preachy, showing that even skinheads and gangbangers are seldom monsters through and through, just people with a lot of anger looking for answers in the wrong places. It is very graphic at times, with one death scene and one rape scene that are particularly brutal, but not sensationalized.<br/><br/>All in all, a good film. As with any film, you should appreciate what it is artistically first, then worry about any ""message"" second. AMX's message is obvious, and I doubt very many people, outside of neo-nazis and the Klan, are going to be upset by it."
"lodger13","Null","0","0","23 November 1998"," flawed but still good
","Wanting to be poetic, topical and hard-hitting all at the same time, this Tony Kaye film comes up short a little too often. Still, it can be a powerful and affecting film.<br/><br/>Edward Norton stars as a skinhead who is just released from prison. He returns to a fatherless family adrift in his absence which includes a younger brother (Edward Furlong) who has tried to emulate his bigoted sibling. The film is told in both present tense (color) and flashback (black and white) and weaves a disjointed tale of the possible motivations of hatred based on race. It throws into this mix of skinheads, blacks and Hispanics, a powerful black principal (Avery Brooks), a supposed granddaddy of the ""hate"" movement (Stacey Keech), a struggling, widowed mother (Beverly D'Angelo), a Jewish teacher (Elliot Gould), and a black stand-up comic inmate (Guy Torrey).<br/><br/>Norton is remarkable, playing both the bravado of the intelligent skinhead who can quote endless statistics as well as impress with his physical prowess in flashbacks and the questioning, struggling con trying to come to terms with a past he wishes to leave behind in the color ""present tense"" scenes. His acting is so perfect, so intricate, that one might easily overlook how awesome he is here. Furlong, however, struggles to keep the material brisk. Forced to be a impressionable follower, his catharsis is a little too perfunctory, a little too hard to swallow.<br/><br/>Kaye is often weighted down by the ham-handed moments in the script from David McKenna. The film wants to be powerful but often comes across as if it were written by a newspaper editor who cut and paste numerous statistics into the text. It also, at times, tries to be dramatic but fails under Kaye's neophyte direction. And when it tries to be poetic, more often that not, it fails and simply becomes tedious or ill defined. For example, the film begins and ends with water, in particular, waves lapping at the shore. One suspects Kaye means this to show not only the persistence of time but also the repetitive cycle of racism and hatred which is handed down from generation to generation. Instead, it comes across as really just another rather drab and typical way to have an opening credits sequence.<br/><br/>But Kaye can also make magic on the screen, particularly in the more brutal scenes he depicts. The murder in the film's midway point is one of the most shocking and disquieting moments I have witnessed in the cinema. Likewise, his prison rape sequence is both cruel and cinematic. Kaye also makes a dramatic point about race early in the film by shooting a conversation between black teacher and white student in extreme close-up, so that the juxtaposition of their skin color becomes paramount to the moment. Kaye seems more at ease with these moments than he does with poetic subtlety or, worse yet, the tenuous dialogue.<br/><br/>Make no mistake about it, ""American History X"" is a very good movie. But in the hands of a better director, it could have been 100 times more powerful. With a script editor, a better actor than Furlong (sorry Eddie) and an ace cinematographer, it could have been the most important film of the 90's"

","This was probably one of the most hard-hitting movies released in 1998. Centering around a skinhead's sin and redemption, and the effect that his actions have on his family, American History X is a definite classic. This movie is gripping, spellbinding (despite half of it being filmed in black and white), and the ending sequence may even cause you to drop a tear. However, with every classic comes lots of mistakes, and it's these mistakes that prevented American History X from getting better recognition and more awards.<br/><br/>Of course, I can't start pointing out the movie's flaws without first singing the praises of central star Edward Norton. His performance in this movie absolutely redefines the word ""bravura"".  Another great thing about Norton in this movie is that his character is probably one of the most well-written skinheads I've ever seen in a movie. Young screenwriter David McKenna really painted Derek in broad strokes, making him intelligent, well-informed, calculating, and even calm at some points.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, aside from Norton's performance, there is really nothing else to cheer about in this movie. There are many logical flaws for instance, how does one run-in in prison cause Derek to completely change around his whole mentality? How does this event make him realize that Nazism is the wrong way? That's never explained.<br/><br/> There are also flashback sequences in this movie that also make some errors. In one scene, Derek is thrown out of his house after cursing out the Jewish teacher. But in the beginning of the movie, Derek is back  in the house to commit the double murder.<br/><br/>Derek's fat friend Seth is a by-the-numbers skinhead, right down to Nazi music in the car. Cameron (as played by Stacy Keach) is probably the second most interesting character in the movie. He is cunning, looks like everyman, and has a whole nation of skinheads wrapped around his finger (a la Hitler). But McKenna simply introduces him by name, sets up some confrontation with Danny, and brings him on screen just so Derek can knock him out. And the whole thing with Sweeny just didn't belong in this movie. Even though he is crucial to the plot, it could've been restructered so Sweeny wasn't involved at all.<br/><br/> But overall, this is a flawed but extremely worthy movie. Don't let these little flaws turn you away from it at the video store. This well worth the watch for anybody at all."

","Ed Norton is brilliant as a neo-Nazi with a serious race problem.  Norton's character, Derek Vinyard, was launched on the path to racisism as his middle-class white, fireman dad makes comments about the unfairness of affirmative action.  His dad's death puts him over the edge.  He relishes killing 2 blacks who are stealing his car.<br/><br/>Vinyard finds himself in the racial role-reversed world of prison and, while folding laundry with a young black man, has his eyes opened to what is like to be black.  He questions his perspective and, on his release, comes out a very changed person.<br/><br/>The movie treats racisism is an utterly stark manner. When I left the theatre, I felt that I had seen someone's heart, lungs and liver cut from their body, thrown out on a table and had someone say: ""Yep! That's what was in there""."

I have been looking forward to it since I last saw AHX in March this year (this is also my second comment on AHX). <br/><br/>Well, so what did I think the second time? I have thought about AHX a lot since I saw it last, and it lived up to my memories of it. AHX is without a doubt one of the most powerful films I have ever seen. The experience of watching this film completely drains me, I get very emotionally involved in what happens to the Vinyard  family (Derek and Danny in particular, of course). I could go on and on about how brilliant this film, but I will try to keep it short; I have nothing bad to say about this film, some of the flaws that other people has brought up here at IMDb is too small for me to care about, I'm aware of a few of these flaws but as the film is so powerful and brilliant I just don't care about that. A movie is not only about what is there in the script, it's about what you feel when you watch it, and AHX will definitely make you feel something. <br/><br/>Edward Furlong is very good in this film, it's probably his best performance ever, I do believe that he's even better than he was in ""American Heart"".<br/><br/>Edward Norton is absolutely brilliant! His performance as Derek Vinyard is awe-inspiring, how he did not win the Oscar he was nominated for is beyond me. Not only is his performance awe-inspiring, it's almost surreal as well, because how could anyone be that good? Edward Norton is one of the reasons to watch this film. Even if the premise does not seem interesting to you I think you should see AHX anyway because Norton's performance will blow you away.<br/><br/>(10/10)"

Myself being a black woman, this is quite a concept for me to admit.

This is the sort of film that I eat up, given its human rights/politically-oriented theme and its somewhat bombastic script. (That's not meant in a bad way, despite what it may seem.) It's Norton's eyes that do it - witness his facial expression as he turns to face the camera, hands over his head, ready to be handcuffed.

"Aislynn","Null","0","0","15 October 1999"," Excellent and moving...""flaws"" do not interfere.
","This movie is wonderful, and many of the flaws others have explained did not take away the power of this film for me. Some have wondered why it took Danny only one night to change all his views his brother taught him.  But you have to remember something about Danny.  He was doing many of it just to please others.  Think of when Seth came over with the video camera and demanded Danny recite everything he was taught, and Danny began regurgitating information in a monotone, as if he truly didn't care.  It was only when Seth began harping on him that Danny gave him what he wanted and began spouting racist garbage.  <br/><br/>As far as Derek goes, I agree that the change in him was a bit sudden, but we didn't see his three years in prison, 24 hours a day.  A lot happens over time and prison is a strange place where one's mind undergoes all SORTS of changes.  Perhaps the film makers could have developed it a bit more, but then maybe people would be whining about how the pacing was too slow.<br/><br/> Without revealing the ending, let's say it is perfectly ironic and purely sad.  It leaves you feeling as if you were punched in the chest, it's that powerful.  The photography is beautiful in the beginning and final scenes, and the montage of black and white versus color is tastefully done.  Never have I seen a film that uses flashbacks so wonderfully.  Through each scene we receive a little bit more of the puzzle. (The flashback that seemed most essential to me was Derek and his father at the dinner table). <br/><br/>
 Another film I was almost glad never took off in flying numbers at the box office.  Fame almost tends to cheapen certain films.  See this movie, it is unique and extremely well made."

It's about how hate can arise in any social and cultural background, but especially among frustrated people, and how it can condemn people to isolation, loneliness and self-destruction.<br/><br/>The movie is excellent, and is enhanced by great acting; Norton and Furlong are simply extraordinary. The physical violence shown is not as important to the message as the violence which remains in pseudo-ideologies born from irrationality and aim for power and domination above the rest, all of which are portrayed as a result of the loss of hope and generosity.<br/><br/>
But the best of all is, in my opinion, the final message, which is morally refreshing, even if I felt Derek's moral recovery  was a little too idillic and unbelievable; I mean, it comes on through his friendship with a black man at jail. I don't believe things happen that way actually when someone's so fanatic.  Anyway, the film is great."

","""American History X"" aspires to tackle important social issues, but ends up making mind-boggling points ""Violence is bad"" and ""Racism is bad"" (think of it being said by Mr. Mackey the school counsellor). It's makers' strategy: let's show acts of some race-based violence, put 'bad' tags on the ones who commit it, 'good' tags on the ones who oppose them, and then make a couple of baddies join goodies, because, clearly, it's so much better to be good. The main characters (two brothers and their mother) make sudden ideological u-turns, not because it can be explained by their personalities or by the circumstances, but because it's convenient for the plot. Without revealing too much of it, the Edward Norton character, a young neo-nazi leader, sees the error of his ways after encountering one decent black kid in the pen. He jokes around with him, finds out he likes basketball - and that's all it takes! How wonderful! And get a load of this - Norton plays the most believable character of this mess of a story. His brother (Edward Furlong) undergoes the similar change upon merely hearing his brother's story. We're not even told what happens to the mother - she just suddenly becomes a completely different person. Finally, the ending is absolutely moronic (i can't go in greater detail without revealing it, but it's very very stupid). ""American History X"" is a very shallow and poorly-made movie. Norton is a good actor, but he's nowhere near Oscars here."

","I have to say that for all the hype I heard before seeing this movie, I was greatly disappointed in it. Although Edward Furlong, and Edward Norton play strong roles in this film, there was just something missing in the story to explain the sudden life affirming changes in Norton's character. I don't buy that his little bit of jail time could change his apparently strong hatred and negative emotions to his rival race. There just wasn't enough character involvement, or educational development in his character to believe that he could make such a wise decision. We are led to believe that he is a very smart, and charismatic leader, in forming and running his own ""white supremecy"" group, yet it all comes to a grinding realization when he spends some time in jail with a few black people, and sees how his own ""supremist"" group deals on an even keel with all of the other races in prison. I think this movie had so much more to offer, and started off on the right track, but just went flying along on that track too fast, and missed out on some issues that should have been dealt with on the characters level. I give it a 5 out of 10...but could have been easily an 8 or 9 if only character development wasn't rushed along so fast."

","I have watched American History X and I loved every second of it. It vividly portrays how blindly cruel humanity can become. The important thing one must keep in mind  is that both Derek and Danny had the right to feel bitter the way they felt. Derek learnt his lesson thanks to his mentor ( who is ironically coloured ) in prison. Derek, being the eldest in the family has a deep impact on his younger brother Danny, who is in turn ignorant of his brother's change in opinion. I find that Derek's role in the film is to patch up the aftermath of his initial neo-nazis way of life  ... retribution and the killing of the inferior race. The scene where he looks at himself in the mirror seeing the swastica and feeling incapable of erasing it besides being most impressive, hints at his futile fight to erase the effects he had on Danny.  One could say,  Danny changed in the end. In the film, it is the mentor phrase that predominates ... stop the vengeance and the killing to have them stopped being done to you.<br/><br/>There is only one thing that irked me in the film. It is the fact that Derek's impression on Danny took whole years to be implanted and grow ... how on earth did these be eradicated overnight ?"

","Please note that these comments include spoilers, so if you have not seen this movie do not read on.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie as have been already said was great - enough said I think. Of course this was helped by a great script as well in many respects. However this movie should not be regarded as a classic because of the following flaws in plot design and characterisation. 1) At the beginning of the movie, Derek seems to have a valid right to protect his property against those black people who were stealing from him. It would have been best if the movie depicted the black people just sitting on his wall and talking and then Derek got mad and did what he did.<br/><br/>2) The middle part of the movie is a complete disaster. The prison scenes were the biggest let down in the movie without a doubt. How Derek quickly made friends with that black convict is unrealistic considering that he rejected mixing with the other blacks in the prison. His conversion and realisation of his criminal activity was too quick and non-existent or simply to unrealistic. When Derek is raped in the shower we see that he has suffered physically, but mentally we do not see how he copes with this harrowing situation. <br/><br/>3) When Derek makes his racist arguments there is no counter comments made throughout the movie, therefore the viewer is totally confused how Derek could have changed.<br/><br/>4) When Derek slaps the face of the leader of the Neo-Nazi organisation, we do not see the leader reacting against Derek afterwards by going around to Derek's place (like in many scenes in the Godfather movies) with his henchmen. Rather we get an unrealistic ending which involves a side incident that occurs in the movie, rather than the main purpose.<br/><br/>This movie is worth watching, but misses out on the classical status because of its flaws - hence no best picture norm in the oscars. Only if these flaws could have been dealt with then it would have been one of the greatest movies of all time."

","For a film that was clearly intended to be a jolting social commentary about the serious state of racial tension in contemporary America, I found it to be oddly lacking in any real dramatic `kick'. To be sure, it does have all the elements that should have added up to a classic tale of an `American Tragedy'---skinheads, guns, betrayal, and the final price of redemption---but somehow the end result seems all too neat and clear-cut (`black-and-white,' if you will) to be totally convincing.<br/><br/>The acting, as advertised, was very, very good. Edward Norton did a fine job of rendering a believable (despite the shortcomings of the script) portrait of a troubled, yet bright and sensitive young man, and does deserve all the credit he has received. Having said that, I must say that it was the other Edward who really gave me a pleasant surprise. Furlong's role as Danny is by no means as showy as Norton's, but his performance was every bit as impressive. By bringing a rich mixture of quiet intensity and genuine sense of innocence to the role, Furlong has made Danny into someone very `real', someone you would actually care for---the sweet boy next door who's going through a rough, confusing period.<br/><br/>Stacy Keach is one veteran who is always dependable, and in this film, he is chilling, dangerous, and oddly hilarious all at once. Good show for him! In fact, I liked everyone's performance with the exception of one: Avery Brooks as Dr. Sweeney. I do acknowledge the fact that he's supposed to be the strict-but-fair `guardian angel', and must therefore carry a certain measure of `weight of authority' in playing this role, but boy, there is such a thing called `overdoing it'. Frankly, he looked so stiff and uncomfortable that I began to suspect that maybe his suit was too heavily starched. It's a shame because Brooks is actually a good actor who hasn't been too lucky in getting meaningful roles such as this one.<br/><br/>All in all, the film is a solid one, the superb acting compensating for the lack of depth in terms of story development. It is a well-known fact that director Tony Kaye tried to get his name off the whole project due to `creative differences'. I have no way of telling, but I vaguely suspect that he was aiming for a direction that would have been more in line with what I had expected to see in this film. It would be interesting if he decides to tell his version by releasing a `director's cut' at some point."

Yet this statement (on the part of the writers) shows that violence begets violence and that there is no end to racism and bloodshed in the earth.  A truly converted Derek would have gotten his brother out of town and would have made sure that something was done to soften the anger of the avenger.  At the very least, a changed Derek would have been overcome by sorrow for the victim whose skull he crushed, rather than realizing that being pissed off did not help him better his life.

My problem with the film, though, is that the ending didn't really hing on the plot of the movie.

There are few movies that I have seen lately that have used so much innovation in its shots. 2) Edward Norton was robbed of an Oscar when it comes to American History X. He is perhaps the most underrated actor in Hollywood and his convincing portrayal was flawless."

","I did not see this movie until after Norton received the Oscar nomination, so my expectations were elevated somewhat (I had high standards for Norton to begin with). What I saw once I finally viewed this movie was a rather earnest look at the combination of ignorance and immaturity and how one's thinking evolves with time using a topic that will always draw definite lines: race relations. I still have trouble with the bonding of Norton and his laundry room buddy (all it took was a little 'I miss my woman' thing for Norton to let down his guard?), as it came too easily, and I have a hard time thinking that little guy was going to keep Derek out of trouble with the rest of the black prison population, but hearing Norton's dialogue and sleek casting (Ed Furlong, Fairuza Balk, and Ethan Suplee, as much as I hated his character) more than made up for the questionable bonding. The casting approval extends to the ill Beverly D'Angelo and the ""E/R""-before-George-Clooney's-ER-star Elliott Gould as the teacher.<br/><br/>Norton was great, period. Some scenes were chilling, enough to prompt a rating of 9 out of me. The extension of the first scene later in the movie involving the curb .... that still brings flinching obscenities from my mouth.

","I'm stunned. This must be the best drama I've ever seen! I though of this movie for days after seeing it. Every time I came to the same conclusion. This can't be done better! I believe that this film really describes how the neo- Nazi ideology works. One man is a leader type. He is coward, cunning, eloquent and always very careful, keeping himself in the background. Seth, played by Ethan Suplee, is this person. We see how he manipulate young and easy impressionable boys and girls and builds up a hate within them. Derek Vinyard, a intelligent young man, became  a neo- Nazi because of something happening to him in the past. It is scary to see how a smart kid like him can develop such attitudes and values because of one event. And that his brother, Danny, looks up to him so much that he will do anything to get his approval. <br/><br/>The plot and acting is magnificent! Edward Norton dives into his role and plays it so well it's scary! He makes the scene where he does the killing so real that it hurts to watch. The expression in his face when he is arrested is nothing but the best acting I've ever seen. Edward Furlong plays his confused and indifferent younger brother. He too is playing his role well. The movie puts an important theme up to debate, racism and neo- Nazism. It shows us how easy we can be manipulated to do horrible things and what the consequences can be. <br/><br/>A great description of an important theme! 10 out of 10 stars."
"allyjack","7","0","0","1 September 1999"," Wildly variable quality, but fascinating and gripping
","Suggests the devil has the best tunes: the portrayal of Norton's immersion in the movement is scintillating, conveying both the visceral excitement and his fearsome articulacy and the sexy physicality it gives him - the scene where the dinner-table discussion of Rodney King grows into a brutal attack on Gould is painful to watch. At such times the sleek, visually punchy style draws you right in and is all the more mesmerizing for the repulsive nature of the identification.  But the movie has way more problems with the other side of the argument. The prison scenes are reasonable enough, if too reliant on a single amiable black guy as a positive influence on Norton, but Furlong's personal journey makes far less sense - the performance is blank and he doesn't have half the space to explain or demonstrate himself. The closing stretches are messy and disappointing. The social fabric of racism is barely touched on (easily the worst scene is the clunky flashback to the racist dad) and the movie's ""anti"" argument consists mainly of assertions about  racists being sad, time-wasting assholes. Despite this wildly variable quality, it was one of the more fascinating and gripping movies of its year."

I am also dissapointed in the Academy for not putting this down as a contender for Best Picture of the year.

","Finally... Finally a movie director found the courage to create a film about racial indifferences with a grasp on ""reality."" This is the first movie that I have ever viewed that doesn't promote the increasing, ever-popular reverse-racism trait that has been spread throughout this society like a cancer. And society just blindly accepting it. Directors like Spike Lee would understand this statement in full detail. I've had my fill of movies such as ""White Man's Burden"", ""A Time To Kill"",and ""Do the Right Thing"". All of them promoting the same basic story line; The black man must fight to overcome the evil white man. There is more to these movies than just that, but ""the evil white man"" trait is what they are constantly trying to implant into society's mind. DO NOT READ ANY FURTHER OF YOU DO NOT WANT SCENES OF THE MOVIE GIVEN AWAY!... ""American History X"" is a film that finally shows the other side of the coin. The main character, Derek Vinyard, played by the brilliant Edward Norton, is not shown as a mindless, irrational, blood-thirsty, skin-head. He is a character that possesses good leadership qualities , is intelligent, and has a somewhat righteous cause. Unlike the usual qualities possessed by a character, playing in a similar role. I very much like the scene in the movie where the 3 black youths are beating up the 1 white youth in the restroom at school. Or all the young black men raising havoc on the basketball court. Or the 2 black men attempting to steal Derek Vinyard's vehicle. These are all depictions of the actual reality that I remember as a young kid, growing up. Usually these black and white roles are reversed in any other film created. ""Political correctness"" is not a factor in this movie. ""American History X"" shows that racism is wrong, no matter if your black or white. The story shows the inevitable outcome when your life is devoted to a self-destructive cause. Everyone is entitled to his/her own beliefs, but to act on them in some cases can mean disaster. My hats off to the director, and all the actors/actresses especially. They played roles that were probably criticized by the media and society at large. Edward Norton was at his absolute best! He makes the movie. I will definitely recommend it to anyone.

  After having shot and killed two black people as they were trying to break into his car, Derek Vinyard (Norton) is sent up the river for three years, a journey he will never forget.  When he is released, Derek seems to have changed a whole lot while he was in prison and as soon as he gets home, he tells his young brother (Edward Furlong) who looks up to him as if he were looking up to God, that he doesn't want him to get involved in the Nazi community as he did.  He also tells his kid brother not to attend a Nazi party that is held the same night Derek just got out.  Not listening to his big brother, Danny attends the party and is caught red-handed by Derek. <br/><br/>
  It is at the party that we see just how much Derek has changed.  He even goes so far as to asking his girlfriend to follow him by leaving the Nazi party and its community for ever. After she refuses, Derek finds his brother Danny at the party and escapes with him.  After the escape, Derek tells Danny what happened to him in jail and makes him understand why he changed and why Danny should as well.<br/><br/>  The movie doesn't have any flaws and is powerful all along.

That we can make a difference in this world. That we are in complete control of our lives and can change the direction our life is going if we have the guts and tenacity.<br/><br/>Mainly, I guess, I loved that Derek Vinyard saw the errors in his (and his brother Danny's) direction and was responsible enough to do something to change it. That he cared enough for his brother to lovingly help him to completely change the way he thought and, as a roll-model in Danny's life, to show him the example necessary to turn him around.<br/><br/>I usually don't like movies with excessive violence and especially foul language, but in this case I think they were both necessary to show the extremely hateful world the white-supremests live in. I think it made it's point well. (Just be sure not to allow younger children near the screen while watching this.

","American History X is a startling film that never lacks focus in its portrayal of a white racist; both in his learning and departure of the extremest beliefs. Kaye's debut is something he should be proud of, rather than trying to distance himself from the project. Each and every shot is well taken and the story, although constantly changing from past to present, flows like few other films do. Dealing with such a subject matter with force and staying neutral is an accomplishment in itself.<br/><br/>Edward Norton's performance definitely merited the Oscar nod. Scenes in which he shows rage and anger towards Blacks, Jews or even members of his own family are what make this film what it is. Very few actors could have pulled this role off (think of Ben Affleck in this role instead and you will follow). Norton also shows the other side of his acting ability frequently in the film and is especially potent towards the end. This role moves Norton into the upper echelon of actors that can carry a film on their own. Without Norton, there is no American History X.<br/><br/>The supporting cast all play their role to par. Edward Furlong does well in the role of the younger brother, although he is no Norton. Stacy Keach plays the leader of the skinheads very well and should have had a greater presence in the film. Beverly D'Angelo, John Avery and Elliot Gould round up the cast, all giving their usual smart performances. <br/><br/>The only problem I has with this film was the manner in which Norton's character is such an extreme racist and is changed so quickly. Without giving away the reason, and a good one it may be, I felt that the sudden change took away credibility from the story. Perhaps this was one of the points that Norton and Kaye disagreed on.<br/><br/>Regardless of any squabbles that may have occured between Kaye and Norton, this film is still one of the best of 1998. I would surely like to find out what the disagreement was about and whether it was personal or film-based.<br/><br/>

In ""Odessa,"" Tim Roth starred as a ruthless hitman who comes to terms with his estranged father. He also reunites with his kid brother(Edward Furlong), for whom he doesn't want involved in his ""line of business"" . ""History X"" is about a white-supremacist skinhead (played by Edward Norton) who reforms himself and doesn't want his brother (Also played by Edward Furlong) to go the same path as he did. Do the plots sound similar? Thought so. The endings for both movies are similar as well. And like both movies, the characters were not very sympathetic, and the message (if there was any) fell FLAT.<br/><br/>For those of you who've seen it, you'll remember a line monologued by Furlong at the end saying ""there is no time for anyone to be saturated with hate and anger."" And then you'll remember what happened to him, which is a total contradiction about the line and the point. So what is that supposed to prove? It seems we've been suckered into the same sort of Melodrama before: Guy succumbs to something bad because of his father. Guy wants to redeem himself but it won't be easy because he'll have to run into a couple of tragedies along the way. How many times are we going to see that? This is a Made-for-TV plot nuance. They've done it before in ""Bad Lieutenant"", then someone made ""Little Odessa,"" then there was ""Affliction"", and now this. What next? A movie about a drug addicted porno star who is the way he/she is because the parents were equivalent to J. W. Gracy and Lorena Bobbitt?<br/><br/>This movie wasn't without its redeeming points. Edward Norton and Avery Brooks delivered excellent performances, which would probably give the only reason to see this. Don't see it for any other reason. Many have also missed the point that this film has a sentimental portrayal of racists, making them look ""like intelligent and loving people."" Wrong.

","One knows America is problematic when one of its heads of state publicly denies the act of the Holocaust, one of the greatest tragedies of human existence. In ""American History X,"" one can deny that it existed, but one cannot deny the true hatred that is planted in each of us.<br/><br/>The film revolves around Edward Norton, a NeoNazi who runs a group of hatred-filled white boys into looting and pillaging. After committing murder himself, he is locked into prison. His brother, Edward Furlong (in a great performance,) begins to follow in his footsteps, with the same friends and leaders his older brother had being held up in high regard. Once out of prison, Norton must turn his brother away from this path before it kills his whole family.<br/><br/>As usual, Norton is spellbinding, and incredible to watch. From watching the pure hatred in his eyes when he kills to the desperation and tears when he needs help, he is utterly convincing always, and provides a character one cannot help but latch onto.<br/><br/>Edward Furlong gives what I think to be the best performance of his career, downplayed and subtle, as the younger brother. He is best displayed at his callous disregard for his African-American peers, and then at his racist slander with Ethan Suplee. His character, often a silent observer, is wonderfully enacted by this young man who, if he continues along this road, could easily be another star when he gets older.<br/><br/>To me, Beverly D'Angelo and Ethan Suplee are the wife from National Lampoon and the 3D-picture-watcher from Mallrats, respectively. When I saw them in the cast list, I let out a chuckle, but both gave stark portrayals: D'Angelo is at her peak when she screams, ""I'm embarrassed you came out of my body!"", and Suplee almost makes ""The White Man Marches On"" amusing to watch if not for its highly disturbing slander.<br/><br/>A Fairuza Balk fan, I was pleased to see her in it, though I think her part could have been bigger. More impact could have been given to her still-racist comments to Norton upon his release, but she was, of course, a pleasure to watch.<br/><br/>Avery Brooks was captivating as the role I knew there would have to be: the highly-intelligent, role-model black man. It was all too obvious this part would come up, and luckily it was well-done. Elliot Gould's part, while small, was great to watch as a Jewish man whose girlfriend's son, Norton, razes him with anti-semetic comments.<br/><br/>However, all of this would be useless without the intricacies of the plot. I found myself nearly agreeing with what Norton and William Russ (in a brief but truly disturbing performance) was saying to some point about hate crimes and affirmative action, even what they were saying about Rodney King. But the point of the movie is that, to quote Edward Furlong, ""Hate is baggage."" One can be filled with hate, but to extend it to such proportions is useless and degrading to us all. It is a downer, yes, but one that should be seen by all, if only to make some people see exactly how this impacts everyone. The violence, though much vaunted, isn't that much at all compared to most movies these days with much lower AMA ratings.<br/><br/>And yes, I am a white man. I am also half-Hispanic. And I found myself both relating to and recoiling from every word and action from every race and gender. No one is right, and no one is wrong. Go out and rent it. Your brain will thank you."

","Edward Norton heads an extremely competent cast in this timeless portrayal of a young man's descent into racial hatred and violence, and it's affects on family and himself. A typically stunning performance by Norton is certainly the highlight of this fine film. Norton plays Derek, a young man's whose life is torn apart by the death of his father. Unable to cope with his senseless loss, he focuses his anger outward towards his community's racial minorities. Charismatic and compelling, his energy is used to bring others into his world of intolerance, not the least of which is his own brother. His strikes against the perceived injustices against the ""white community"" eventually culminate in one fatal moment, and Derek is jailed for his crime.<br/><br/>The film deals with Derek's release from prison, and his attempts to disassociate himself from belief in which he no longer has faith. But matters are compounded by his brother's near idolatry of his actions and young Danny (Edward Furlong in an uncommonly good performance) has his feet firmly planted on the road upon which Derek has already tread. Not only must Derek redeem himself, but also the mind of his sibling.<br/><br/>However fine this movie begins, it's effect is severely hampered by obvious post-production touches like Furlong's movie long narrative. The film moves along beautifully until the ending, whereupon it seems that certain plot elements were discarded in masse. Director Tony Kaye was so incensed by changes made by the studio that he unsuccessfully lobbied to have his name removed from the film. After viewing this movie again on video, I can understand why. A film that could very well have been this decade's most powerful statement on the politics of hate is reduced to a tepid whimper. A whimper that should have been a roar."

I would venture to call this film a masterpiece, certainly one of my favorites and the best movie of 1998, along with Saving Private Ryan.  The film is very well-crafted and the flashbacks are poignant as well as powerful in showing how the events surrounding one person can affect so many people around him.  I tended to forget that the flashbacks were in black-and-white since the images stayed with me long after watching the film.  Also, this is one of those films where repeated viewings enhances the pleasure.  At first viewing, it is hard to understand the importance or effect of the flashbacks, but after the second viewing the story fits in perfectly.  Director Tony Kaye was so displeased with the finished project (his first film, have you) that he attempted to give the director's credit in an alias, (which I think was Humpty Dumpty). Anyway, if this is what he considers an embarrassment then I am very interested in seeing some of his future works.  And by the way, Stanley Kubrick, whom Kaye reportedly compared himself to, also disowned his first feature film.  And as for the cynics who say that the ending is a misfire, I think it is brilliant.  It leaves so many questions opened; Will Derek return to hate? Will his family ever recover? Who is to blame for the problems in society? These questions really remind me of Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange.  I am eagerly awaiting Tony Kaye's future projects, but I guess he won't make another film for about 5 or six years."

American History X is one of the more intense, riveting dramas I've ever had the pleasure of watching. Edward Norton's performance was breathtaking, and it puzzles me why he isn't casted more often. This movie totally disillusioned me and showed just how incomprehensible a true racist's mind is. I still can't shake the last, dramatic and shocking scene from my mind. It was one of the few times I've wept openly during a movie, and it shows the absolute futility of unconditional hate. This movie isn't for the emotionally immature. If you're not going to take it seriously, don't bother watching it. However, for all those strong enough to handle the emotions, this movie should be a jaw-droping, eye-opening rollercoaster of passion and drama."
"Zombied","9","0","0","22 July 1999"," Very powerful movie,and must see as well
","Although American History X does somewhat lag in the early beginning,and on top of it may slightly come across with a TV movie feel to it,the film does quickly pick up and is quite powerful in it's depiction of a disgruntled young mans coming to terms with the death of his father who was killed by minorities during the LA riots,Director Tony Kaye has a very riveting formula to make the viewer almost somewhat understand and relate as to why young Derek would associate himself with his neo nazi counterparts.This in turn is the sole reason why the movie really is so hard hitting and all the more gutsy. As for the dialogue,i must admit there were some scenes which were next to brilliant,kudos to writer David Mckenna.As for Edward Nortons acting i can truly say it was a very well acted and well a delivered portrayal,i can see hands down why he won such critical acclaim and was also awarded the nomination for best supporting actor.All in all i think American History X is well worth a rental,movies like this do not come around everyday."

","When I think of the movie American History X, I see an image.  An image of Edward Norton's character, Derek Vinyard, eyes ablaze and standing in the street wearing only a pair of white boxer shorts.  The big bold swastika on his chest sticks out and has a sort of character that says, ""Hey.  Get the f*ck out of my way or you'll be sorry.""<br/><br/>The story is about Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton), who is somewhat of a white supremicy leader, and his younger brother Daniel Vinyard (Edward Furlong). Derek has just spent 3 years of his life in jail because he has murdered 2 people.  American History X chronicles the emotional and psychological change of Derek Vinyard -- after spending his time in jail, he realizes that life is too short to be pissed off, and nothing that he's done (white supremicy-wise) has made his life better and hating is not the way to a better life.  He's also trying to teach this lesson to Daniel Vinyard because he is afraid that his younger brother will fall in the same ill-fated footsteps.  It also shows the emotional pain that his family must go through because he has to face the concequences of hate.<br/><br/>The bottom line of this movie is simple -- hate does not lead to a better life, and, quoted from the movie, ""life's too short to be pissed off.""<br/><br/>My rating:  ****/****"

","despite a fantastic lead performance from edward norton this film failed to convince on every conceivable level. it's view on urban racism was far too simplified - are we to believe that derek, a straight A student, would become a nazi due to an ignorant, bigoted comment from his father? similarly, are we to believe he would then renounce his white supremacist views upon meeting a nice, friendly black man in prison? are we to accept his redemption because of this, conveniently forgetting his two brutal murders earlier? absolute tosh. the ending was not in the least bit shocking either as it was horribly contrived and, in fitting with the rest of this gibberish, an unconvincing cop out.<br/><br/>at best this movie is implausible but sadly, in the main, it's just unbelievable and insulting nonsense. it was completely lacking in any depth or understanding behind the problem at hand, opting instead for rhetoric and style (did we really need to see so many slow-motion shower scenes? you half expected derek to turn to the camera and say, ""take two bottles into the shower?"") instead of any real insight.<br/><br/>two good lead performances and shocking scenes of brutality do not a good film make, as saving private ryan will also testify."

","""American History X"" is very disturbing, but offends just about everyone. It delivers a very convicting message that life is too short for hate and that racism is wrong.  Edward Norton turns in a very strong performance as a former skinhead who gets his act together after doing some time in prison for a racially motivated hate crime.  After his release, he must prevent his younger brother (Edward Furlong) from following in the same path.  The black and white flashbacks answers plenty of questions as to how and why these events occurred.  Some of the offending scenes include the brutal murders of two black men, the liquor store raid and the graphic rape in prison (likely to be cut for TV).  My evaluation: ***1/2 out of ****."

","""American History X"" reminds me of the old Tom Lehrer song: ""We are the folksong army, every one of us CARES, we all fight against social injustice, unlike the rest of you SQUARES.""  The people who see the film will walk out, if they are moved by it, fortified in their personal convictions that there are bad ways of thinking out there that need to be changed for the good of all, and then go back home to their self-satisfied lives.  The main character has been made a tortured saint sanctified by his pure if confused mind, unflinching honesty, and brave heart.  He is gently brought to the true path by two african-american angels, who have no lives of their own aside from their overwhelming desire to reach out and improve his life. They know the real score, inside and out, no question about their legitimacy.  On the other side you have the african-american version of Daniel eager to win the approval of his peers, and the uniformly ugly and fraudulent skinhead opposition.<br/><br/>The real tragedy of this movie with cardboard villains, for me at least, was that most of the acting was first-rate and the scenes were beautifully filmed.  The two Edwards brought tremendous depth to their performances. The violence was close in and personal, focusing your attention on the cost of hating.  When the film focused on the family conversations/fights and Daniel's final paper, it felt honest and real.  There have been several films recently, ""Men With Guns"" and ""Savior"" among others, that have similar messages without scripting a solution.  Why did the film have to distill xenophobia and hatred down to a choice between enlightenment and ignorance when it has never been that simply resolved?"

","After watching this movie, I was so surprised by the excellent performance of the actor - Edward Norton. He was the actor in the movie "" Primal Fear"". I nearly cannot recognize him due to the dramatic change in his physical appearance. As a matter of fact, he is a good actor and he deserves to get the nomination of Oscar Actor. In this film, the director described the thoughts of a racist in very detail, why he thought like that and the impact of the environment and the peer group on his own. Especially in a dinner scene, what Derek says which really shocked me. But i do not prefer using the black and white screen to represent the past. Here, I highly recommend this movie to the people, to see that how stubborn people will be when they choose to have a belief without any doubts even killing people. The most hardest part in human to be changed would be the stereotype, bias and discrimination, the most horrible is that these thoughts can be past over and over the generation like Derek and his father."

","This was one of those films that needs to be about an hour longer -- both because it is so good and because it skims the surface of so many of its' plot points.  For example, the prison scenes needed to be longer and more in depth.  One whole year of Derek's sentence is covered in just a few minutes! Nonetheless, this movie had a powerful and moving message that will not soon be forgotten.<br/><br/>Other than that, though, this was a very good and disturbing movie.  It was nicely shot, with good use of color, camera angle, close-ups, etc.  All of the actors do a good job as well, especially the two leading roles.  I recommend it highly, although if the director ever comes out with an expanded version, it would improve the film immeasurably.<br/><br/>One other thing -- I have to say that I think the movie unfairly (and maybe unconsciously?) labels anyone who is against affirmative action and immigration control as a right-wing racist or even a skinhead.  Watch the two dinner scenes to see what I'm talking about.  Remember, you can be a fair, honest, unbiased person and still be against affirmative action."

AMERICAN HISTORY X is the eye-opener of the 90's and it sure opened mine. For some people, this was not an easy movie to watch for nearly two hours, but for the people who saw it all the way through, it should have done something to you. It should have opened up your eyes just like it did to mine. You know how it will feel after you watch AMERICAN HISTORY X. It probably was not easy for Edward Norton to say what he said,  but it added up for him in the end. When the movie ended, I am sure Nortons' character would have felt the same pain and aguish that all of the people he dealt with in the past (e.g. Elliot Gould) would have felt.

Ooops, I got raped in the shower, I work next to a Black guy in jail, now I'm not a racist anymore."" Oh, okay.  If we're supposed to believe that it's his friendship in jail that changes his mind about Black people, the relationship needs to go a little deeper than sex jokes and basketball (especially since racists believe that all Black people are interested in is sex and basketball.) Then he just walks away from his Neo-Nazi group and they make *NO* attempts on his life or attack his family? And on a trivial note: why go through all the trouble of setting up the fact that his mother more than likely has cancer?

The performances of the cast make what could've been merely a good movie into an excellent one.  The two Edwards (Norton & Furlong) are awesome in their performances.  Furlong has the potential to become a great actor--I hope he chooses his film roles wisely in the future.  But it is mainly Norton who makes this movie so great.  He displays his phenomenal talent.  He has proven that he already is a great actor.  His performance in this movie is, hands down, his best performance!  And his look in this film is quite a change from his usual preppy-ish look in other films.  Besides the two leads, the supporting cast is really good.  Stacy Keach gives a great performance (and is unrecognizable with the way he looks in this film), and Fairuza Balk is, as always, wonderful to watch in another bad-girl role.   As far as the film itself, I liked the use of both black-and-white and color in this film.  It goes well with the plot.  In spite of the controversy surrounding the director of this film, I think that the director did a very good job with this film.  This film turned out to be much better than what I had expected.

","*American History X* is rare among contemporary movies in that it displays an unbending sense of good and evil. Both exist and are clearly identifiable. The movie makes sure that we always know whether a particular action or speech works in the service of good or evil. There is no equivocation.<br/><br/>However, *American History X* also does a superb job contextualizing actions. As a result, we are able to sympathize with a Neo-Nazi at the same time we despise everything s/he believes in and fights for. We are led to see actions, rather than people, as repositories of evil. And of good.<br/><br/>This movie emphatically promotes the idea that even the worst person can be redeemed, though always at a cost. As such, it is as much a religious as a socio-political movie.<br/><br/>Perhaps to underline the social urgency of taking action against evils such as racism, *American History X* dramatically shows how time is of the essence, what can go wrong if action is delayed. To succeed against evil, good must make its move quickly. The longer we wait to put evil back in its box, the greater the cost will be to us individually and to our society.<br/><br/>While this is a highly ideological movie, it is superbly envisioned and acted as a piece of entertainment and art. The ideas flow freely in the form of well constructed narrative action.<br/><br/>Most of the action unfolds as a Neo-Nazi student makes multiple attempts, some abortive, to come to grips with a customized writing assignment given him by his high-school principal. The assignment: to analyze and evaluate the events and situations which propelled the student's older brother into the Neo-Nazi movement. This tactic allows us to wander around a maze and torrent of family history. But fortunately the narrative shoots in at us from another direction occasionally, filling in contexts even more.<br/><br/>If you only rent one video this month, see this one.

This is not a terrible film by any means. However, when a director takes on a meaty subject matter, it is maddening when he has nothing to say. I prefer to believe that Kaye and co. merely bowed to pressure in the way this film caved, but judging from the gritty jailrape and foul language I have to believe that they simply weren't up to the task. What begins as an interesting look into neo-nazism ends up to be about as enlightening experience as  a Disney film. Imagine ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?"" with full frontal nudity and racist obscenity. Those who believe this to be a great film need to see more films.

But it also reminds us that racism and hatred begin in the home, often from thoughtless remarks parents make in front of kids.  The flashback perspective of AHX tells the entire story, and the use of black and white film is a brilliant story device.

","This was a great film.  The acting is superb (especially Norton's) the script is for the most part very solid and there is some excellent cinematic techniques.  The one problem is that it is fairly clear that the film you are watching is not the director's vision.  There are many scenes that leave you confused since the dialogue refers to previous scenes that were cut by the studio.  All in all this is a very daring film and was a big risk but is incredibly successful in portraying the racial problems in North American society."

","This film is the essence of power. Powerful theme, powerful message, and unbelievably powerful performance by Norton. Definitely overlooked as one of the best performances in the last few years. Unfortunate that a film such as this is needed in society, but it succeeds better than any other with the same theme. I haven't read all the comments about this film so I hope this isn't repeated but clearly the most important scene is the conversation at the dinner table with Derek and his father discussing his new teacher (Avery Brooks-also stellar in the film). This is the genesis for the rest of the movie-although Derek's development from the good student prior to this conversation to the extremist he becomes is lost to the natural lack of development that must occur in film, but clearly this type of ""harmless"" dinner chatter (and obviously the circumstances of his father's death) must be emphasized in film and life as powerful."

","It is always easy to poke holes in the the efforts of others. The more sincere and earnest those efforts are, the easier cynical critics find it to denigrate them.<br/><br/>Nothing succeeds entirely and AHX certainly has a number of (minor) weaknesses that others have pointed out - primarily problems with the script. But where it fails it mostly fails because it tries to do something very difficult.<br/><br/>
There is a sincere attempt here to add a thoughtful and provocative comment to the important dialogue on bigotry and hate that is essential to human survival in an increasingly inter-racial, intercultural world. That Kaye and McKenna choose to end with a truism: ""hate is baggage"" - is not a cop-out, but a painful truth - hate is in us and only by dealing with our own hate can we deal with that around us.<br/><br/>What is perceived as Norton's ""vanity"" is completely in keeping with the character - stemming from the same insecurity as his need to control and his racist self-aggrandisement. What else is the swastika tattoo, for instance, but a piece of vanity: primitive body-jewelry? His performance is daring, frightening and compelling if one is able to drop the defenses of cynicism and be moved by it. Ditto Edward Furlong's work.<br/><br/>This is one of the best realised films by a first-time director and first-time screenwriter I can ever remember. Although imperfect, it is damn good. Even to have gotten such a difficult, non-""feel-good"" film to the screen is an enormous labor. All involved deserve thanks and praise for - not a flawless job - but a job very well done."

Not since early Robert De Niro films have I seen a young actor with such range, potential, and talent. I remember being impressed with his brilliant ""rookie"" year, 1996, when he appeared in Everyone Says I Love You, The People vs. Larry Flynt and Primal Fear.

","Any time you go in to make a massive moral statement in a film, much as in an essay, you should be able to back up your argument with equal or greater strength. A lot has already been said about why racism is bad-great movies have been made showing the idiocy of it-and yet it still persists. I'm worried that this film might actually do more harm than good. I thought the skin heads were very well portrayed to the point that their line of thinking could be agreed with by young people who are looking for an answer to there problems. The problem is, the counter points were mainly shown in violent cinematic splendor. The type of stuff we have become conditioned to see with a disclaimer going off in our head saying ""it's only a movie"".<br/><br/>I kept waiting for a moment to pop up when our hero(?) would come through with a truly compelling reason to show his change of heart, but it didn't happen for me. The homosexual prison sequence is the kind of stuff people (who this film was meant to reach) might find funny. And the death at the end bit has been done so many times; it has become convenient to simply off a principle player as a solution.<br/><br/>I felt it was coming close when we were shown how Derek was made to realize that it would take more than a change of heart on his part to make things right; he would have to address his past actions to make things right.<br/><br/>Then the movie ended.<br/><br/>Now one could argue that the death of his brother would have a greater impact than anything else they could have shown, but, as said earlier, it's been done so many times that it seemed like more of a cop-out.<br/><br/>There can be no arguing that Ed Norton was brilliant. Maybe his performance was too good. The look in his eyes after he'd killed the man with his foot was chilling. I saw this look of pride and accomplishment on his face that made me wonder if some young and impressionable sort watching this movie might get the idea that it might be cool to do similar. And that scared me more than anything the movie could have shown.<br/><br/>It's easy to counter this argument with the statement ""It's only a movie"", but this was a ""message movie"" and I feel there is more danger in the right people getting the wrong message."

The fact that this movie makes you think and doesn't just let you off the hook by explaining everything is admirable.<br/><br/>Personally, I think Edward Norton is the best actor in Hollywood today.

In real life he may have attended Yale, and then there's his boyish roles in Primal Fear and Everyone Says I love You....But as the movie progressed I forgot about all that<br/><br/>

The truth is, this movie would do more to abrogate racism, brutality, and (maybe) violence if it were shown more widely.  Edward Norton proves he is not interested in being a pretty boy, but an actor.  Edward Furlong continues to remind us all he's more than that effeminate kid from T2.  For those of us old enough to remember the birth of skinheads, this movie portrayed their hateful, baseless stance head-on.  If you were ever thrown in a moshpit at a Suicidal Tendencies show, you know how you were kicked.  By the biggest group of losers in town.  Until they found Derek Vinyard and felt vindicated. However, this movie turns around and displays the other side.  The mindless quest to be a gangsta.  Without concern.  The only downside of this movie is the preachiness which was understandable but overblown.  The generational influences in this movie are brilliant.

I went into the cinema expecting a similar film to 'ROMPER STOMPER' depicting a skinhead gang being violent.

With Ed Norton playing the powerful lead role as the confused Nazi, I found myself holding my breath or feeling physically sick throughout every scene.

"baeri","9","0","0","16 May 1999"," violence justified
","Much has been said about the amount of violence in the film American History X. I've read comments to the effect that the violence in this film is unnecessary, that we should not be so mesmerized by it, and that a good movie need not show such horror.<br/><br/>I have a differing viewpoint on this. Gratuitous violence in a form of entertainment can have an adverse effect on society to a certain degree. The issue I take is with people who say that the violence in this movie and others like it is unnecessary.<br/><br/>The real reason that people are afraid of the violence in this movie is because this is a truthful representation of hate. Those who truly hate others for the color of their skin, their religion, or national origin are prone to this type of violence.<br/><br/>I live in Pennsylvania. This state has the second highest number of hate groups in the country. I have seen the damage that hate has done to people, the violence that is done against those who are different. This film is an accurate representation of that violence.<br/><br/>The movie also flawlessly points out that this hatred of those who are different does not lie with one particular race of people. The ending, which many have complained is not surprising enough for them, shows the vicious circle that mindless hate can cause. Hate is a learned thing, whether it is white people hating black because parents have handed that down over generations, or black people hating white for trying to keep them down. No one is inherently better than anyone else: it's time we learned that.<br/><br/>The only other thing I have to say about this film is to praise the impeccable performance of Edward Norton as the young man who learns that hate kills the hard way. I fully agree with critics who the week before the Academy Awards stated that Edward Norton would not win only because of his age and inexperience on the Hollywood scene. His portrayal of the teenager who falls into hate and the young man who is hauled out of it by circumstances is superb, and if he had had even one prior nomination, I believe that he would have won the Oscar."

","Movies given to excesses of almost any kind can be forgiven,  provided they adopt an ideological position - even an unpopular one. Unfortunately, movies can also simply be given to excess.  That is more or less the case with American History X, a bloated, gratuitously violent film about home-grown racial bigotry.<br/><br/>Derrick Vineyard (Edward Norton) starts out as a shy, bookish boy whose father peppers his dinner-time conversation with mild racial epithets. Dad's ignorant extemporizations, along with the circumstances of his death, are supposed to help explain Vineyard's transformation from a Wally Cleaver-like character to Ward and June's worst nightmare - the leader and eloquent spokesman of a group of Venice Beach skinheads.   But what about the Beaver?<br/><br/>Derrick's younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) plays the innocent foil, a vulnerable, ideologically labile teenager whose idolatrous admiration for his older sibling is painful to watch.  After Derrick commits an especially heinous crime and is sent to the gray-bar hotel for 3 years, Danny is left on his own.  Predictably, he becomes a skinhead himself and falls under noxious influences - Cameron (Stacy Keach at his unctuous best) - while older brother Derrick becomes the bride of at least 1 inmate (watch for a particularly harrowing ""bridal shower scene."").  Danny's champion during this sojourn is the school principal (Avery Brooks),  who still believes the kid is salvageable.<br/><br/>This is non-linear, trendy  filmmaking at its best, rendered with flashbacks, black and white sequences and slow-motion cinematography. Interestingly, the real-time action takes place over  roughly a 24-hour period, during which time a born-again Derrick (released from prison and transformed back into a good guy) must deprogram younger brother Danny before its too late.  Meanwhile, Danny has to complete an essay assignment given to him by the principle, which the latter hopes will provide an epiphany for the boy and make him see that racism is a bad thing. Duh.<br/><br/>Interspersed with all of this are many admittedly  powerful, gut-wrenching scenes, highlighted by  Norton's inspired performance, Furlong's believable naivetÃ© and Keach's subliminally homoerotic portrayal of an aging neo-Nazi messiah.  Elliot Gould also appears in flashback and does a nice turn as a prissy ideologue who further fuels Derrick's hatred (though hardly accounts for it).<br/><br/>You'll also arrive at the ending before the film does -- because it is essentially given away at the beginning -- but you won't be bored.  Nor, for that matter, will you be very inspired.  You will simply remember some of the scenes.  Perhaps we all should."

","I thought that the movie succeeded largely on the basis of Edward Norton's performance. It was a brave decision on the part of the moviemakers to create a protagonist who could make racism plausible and not to settle for simplistic, self-justifying distinctions between good and evil. At the same time, I can't decide if I approve of the way that the movie deflects racial issues, rephrasing them into questions of personal loyalty and betrayal--while the skinhead characters tend to rationalize their hateful attitudes by citing broad social trends, ultimately the movie seems to lay blame at the feet of treacherous fathers or father figures. Whether or not the movie settles for pat psychologizing to explain the Vinyard brothers' racism is something worth arguing about. Although horrifyingly brutal at times, AMERICAN HISTORY X also has many subtle points to make, but unfortunately its effectiveness is undermined by a contrived ending. Again, the great strength of the film is its star, who accomplishes the rare feat of being both physically and intellectually intimidating, loathsome and admirable."

The film's release was great as it was released in the end of the 90's and perfectly reflects how people in this decade react towards race. The film discusses issues such as the Rodney King riots, illegal immigration and black history in schools, which are all relevant to people in the 90's and are often hotly debated.  This film shows the most violent, extreme and shocking side of these debates, but manages to keep the visual violence to a minimum, unlike the violent Australian neo-nazi film ""Romper Stomper"".<br/><br/>Edward Norton was astounding, as too was Furlong, as a neo-nazi skinhead. Everybody has been praising Norton's performance, deservedly so, however I feel Furlong really made the movie what it is.  His portrayal of the young and impressionable little brother is great, as he manages to capture those traits in an applaudable manner, and really brings his character to the forefront of this movie, more so than, I dare say, was expected.  Norton however SHOULD have won the best actor Oscar for this role.  Tony Kaye has done a wonderful debut job on this film, particularly the way he made the flashbacks into black and white, and deserves high praise for his work.<br/><br/>Everyone should see this movie.

The most important was that I could not feel -because of the flashbacks- the deepness of the film's message as the storyline was broken. This made also impossible to illustrate the process of Derek's arriving to the final point. This part was rather told superficially and in the end we only got a spoon-fed but still neutral conclusion. (The father's conservatism could led to the children's tendency - but quite interesting that the daughter, Davina does not becomes affected..) In spite of this - unfortunately determinated - problem of flash-backing the film represented the most natural and most beautiful flash-backing technique I've ever seen. Splendid idea the way as the final point - killing the black man on the pavement - wasn't presented for the first time (Introduction), this brutal and in a way symbolic action could be saved for the deeper part of the film, making it really catarctic without becoming disturbingly effectual-seeking. The other advantage of the technique that Derek could be presented two ways at the same time to avoid presenting him neither as a rat nor as a hero, always equalizing the bad and the good points of his attitude.<br/><br/>Even not spoken of the importance of the main problem - Neonazism - of the film, I can advise it to everyone."

"Brad K.","9","0","0","2 May 1999"," Edward Norton and American History X will leave you breathless.
","American History X is one of those rare films that once it's over will make you sit silently for a few minutes not moving.  American History X is one of the most powerful movies I have ever seen.  Edward Norton (Primal Fear, Rounders) stars as a recently released prisoner (for the brutal murder of 2 black men) who has recently given up being a Neo-Nazi.  When he comes back from prison he finds that his younger brother, played by Edward Furlong (Terminator 2, Little Oddessa) has followed him down the same path as a Neo-Nazi.  Norton with the help of Furlong's teacher, well-played by Avery Brooks (TV's Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, The Big Hit), tries to get Furlong out of that lifestyle.  The film deals with many flashbacks showing how Norton got where he is now in the film.  The film is disturbing at times, but always compelling and very powerful.  Norton is incredible in the lead role, deserving the Oscar nomination he received.  Furlong is great also, in a difficult role.  Fine support work is turned in by Guy Torry (Life, Ride) as a black man in prison who helps turn Norton around, and Beverly D'Angelo (Vegas Vacation, Lightning Jack) as Norton and Furlong's caring mother. Highly recommended."
"delbomber","8","0","0","3 May 1999"," Powerful and frightening
","For every thirty worthless, big-budget, shoot-em-up action movies whose only purpose is to make a profit, there is a film such as this one.<br/><br/>""American History X"" is one of the most effective, yet frightening, films I have ever seen.  I say frightening because it shows how impressionable young people are, and how easily they are led by someone who asserts him or herself.  The need to feel important and the need for fraternity is prevalent, showing that people are willing to do things they wouldn't normally do, just to be accepted.  Edward Furlong's character is so enamored by his older brother that he tries to emulate his entire lifestyle.  Even Ed Norton's character, Derrick, who seems to be in control, has been influenced by his prejudicial father.  It takes a stint in prison, and a friendship with a black prisoner that changes his life, for him to realize that spending all of one's time hating is wrong.<br/><br/>This is not a movie about neo-Nazi's, although the trailers for this film made it look as if it were.  Rather it is about choices and focuses on the lives of people involved with a hate-group to get it's message across;  it shows the scary but real consequences of living such a life.<br/><br/>I only gave this movie an 8, however, because I had some issues with the film-making that detracted from it.  The story and theme, as I have just commented on, were practically flawless, but Edward Furlong is not an actor I like to see in such an important role, and the ending was predictable. There was an abundance of flashbacks and I think more time should have been spent in the present.  These are minor complaints that are easily overlooked, but they are part of the film so I have to factor them in.<br/><br/>I find it unfortunate that it was only released in 1200 or so theaters because of its controversial subject matter, because THIS is the type of film that should have been released ""in theaters everywhere""."

I work with lots of teens and I have seen some of this rage- and the movie is right on target for what happens when rage is not dissipated. AHX is an important film showing how teachers can affect the lives of their pupils as well as parents-- like the song from South Pacific ""you've got to be taught to hate"" and that is what Derek's dad did- but others taught him to be tolerant.  Norton should have gotten the academy award- but in the days of feel good movies this one is too real to win the acclaim it should have."

","One of the most powerful films I have watched in years. Ed Norton was simply outstanding- very DeNiroesque performance in screen presence and spirit.<br/><br/>Simply put, AHX makes you examine your American beliefs. Many times the movie tries to make you feel good in bad ways -like the b-ball game when the skinheads win. The direction and music during these scenes pushes you to feel happy.  Derek's ""Rodney King tirade"" almost makes sense until you realize his rage outweighs the rational side.<br/><br/>AHX compels you to like Derek and justifies it by his change in mind during the stint in jail. The only weakness of the movie was that the turn around in jail came a little too easy. Lamont befriended him quickly and unconditionally- not very realistic given the crime.  Overall, it touches many areas of life from general race relations to how personal choices affect the people around you.  Great movie."

"critic-22","8","0","0","27 April 1999"," One of the most powerful movies/drama ever made - but flaws remain
","American History X has got a combination of great script writing and acting which when combined bring out an incredible drama that proves that anyone can be manipulated into certain ideas and dogmas. When Edward Norton talks from the racist view point there seems to be some truth to what he is saying. This is what makes him really dangerous as he inspires others to have the same attitude towards other people.<br/><br/>There were a number of faults in this movie that prevented it from classic status, but it is worth seeing it for the qualities I have already mentioned. 1) At the start of the movie I felt that Norton was somewhat justified to harm and get angry about two black youths stealing from him. He was protecting HIS property, this scene could and should have been different if the movie was trying to convey that violence is wrong and unjustified. 2) The prison scene did not convince me that Norton had converted to a different way of thinking. The prison scene was a great opportunity for character development of both Norton and the other inmates that influenced him. This movie failed in this department which as it turns out was fundamental to the whole story. 3) The ending scene it can mean violence leads to more violence is a cliche I have heard in thousands of other movies including Boyz in the Hood. The movie was much more than a black and white issues as another alternative view of the movie's ending could imply. The movie was not simply about hatred, rather emancipating a person through understanding another person's point of view. Yet the movie ended in cliche and violence. This is not totally a bad thing as it would move some people to think about their actions and consequences, but fails to push the debate along from what other related movies have achieved. Tough not as good or clever as Life is Beautiful (La Vita E Bella), both deal with hatred and intolerance and are well both worth seeing for the acting and script alone. American History X 9/10"

","I just saw this movie for the first time last night and I haven't felt this way since the ending of ""The Deer Hunter.""  It's amazing to see a single film take a character and develop him in such a way that it seems like two opposite and distinct personalities.  Ed Norton gave the performance of his life in this movie, and it's too bad that the Academy Award for best actor can't go to two people in a single year.  The thing that impresses me the most is the way that they didn't stereotype the characters like they did in ""Higher Learning"" or make them completely wooden like in ""Juice"" or ""Menace.""  Norton's shining and most convincing moment didn't even come with dialogue in this film.  The flashback scene where Derek just stares at Danny while he gets arrested, with that God-awful grin on his face will probably haunt me for days.

"Ike-18","Null","0","0","23 April 1999"," The most powerful movie I've seen.
","I have just finished American History X and have concluded that it is the most powerful movie I have ever seen.  In accordance to the recent situation in Littleton, Colorado, this movie especially struck home.  And while the acting, cinematography, score, and overall production of this movie was a sheer masterpiece, what makes this movie the truest testament to the soul is its message:  You will reap the consequences of your actions.  Derek's actions, sadly, had gone too far, and the consequences of them were nearly inevitable.  And isn't it sad that this is how we, as humans, can only seem to begin to grasp this concept when something as shattering as the death of a close one draws it blindingly to our attention.  I am a professing Christian, and to any other Christian who is interested in viewing this movie, I must warn you, the language, violence, and sexuality is extremely explicit.  But for once, this is what I appreciate.  The producers did not take the time to muddy their message down for the entire family but gave it to the audience as it is, presented in real life.  As hard as it is to sit through something like this, we do it everyday, in and out, and never give it a second thought.  This movie will wake you up fast, make you question what you believe, and bring you to the harsh but all too true realization that it is up to each and every one of us individually to make a difference for good in the lives we touch.  Otherwise, those lives will be lost, whether to death or a blind and dying world.  If we do not accept this responsibility, we must be willing to accept the responsibility of every tragic situation we could have changed.  After seeing this movie, I personally don't ever want to be a ""could have"" again.  I hope that it affects you in the same heart-wrenching manner that it captivated me.  This is what the movies were made for."
"Nitzer-3","10","0","0","22 April 1999"," The voice of experience...
","In a great majority of the comments I have read, American History X has been described as a 'typical' Hollywood movie. People seem to think that it was just another vehicle for gratuitous sex and violence. Unfortunately the point of it was lost on them. As a former Neo-Nazi, I can vouch for the gratuitous sex and violence...we were not the type to sit around in coffee shops and rationally discuss our 'problems' with non-caucasian people. Non-whites, to the Neo-Nazi, aren't deserving of time and patience (or politeness).<br/><br/>American History X really struck a chord, a very painful chord, in the way that it explained the behavior and beliefs of the average Neo-Nazi. Neo-Nazi's are a 'family' of sorts and will not be changed by 'rational' ideas. American History X took a subject that is generally taboo and turned it into a movie about the truth. It didn't display all Neo-Nazi's as ignorant and it didn't display all African-American's as violent, drug-abusing gang-bangers. This movie brilliantly captured reality. The cinematography wasn't perfect, neither was the plot. But that doesn't matter. What matters is that it made its point effectively. The point wasn't that racism is there and that racists are bad. The point was more along the lines of: There is a problem. We have to do look closer than we have been to solve it. Otherwise, nothing will change and racism will get worse, not better!<br/><br/>The principal was an extraordinary example of an African-American man who has risen above the racism and hate to the point that he entered a jail to comfort, albeit not for that sole purpose, Derek (the main character / Neo-Nazi), who had been raped by fellow Neo-Nazis in prison.<br/><br/>American History X went further than that. It showed that even someone like Derek, who believed so strongly in his races (white) superiority, can change. It showed that not all people are 'lost causes'. Don't get me wrong, this wasn't a 'feel-good' movie, people died and a great deal of pain was evident.<br/><br/>This movie is excellent and a must see for anyone who wants to take a peek at the real world of Neo-Nazis and their violent (and all-too-often short) lives. This movie was, to me, like looking in a mirror and straight through to my past. American History X can be an eye-opener for anyone willing to look and learn without prejudice and bias and without PRIDE!<br/><br/>To quote an old friend, and former Neo-Nazi:<br/><br/>""There is nothing more dangerous in this world than the          person who sees everything and learns nothing.""<br/><br/>American History X: A 10 out of 10."

","It was very easy to realize in the beginning that I, too, would've found AMERICAN HISTORY X a minor coincidence in the making. Well, I was wrong. Again! Even with the influential direction of Tony Kaye and solid acting of Edward Norton and Edward Furlong, the movie still could have squeezed more juice. It could have been simply more or less. More on its details and less of the slow pace, to be exact. You won't keep anybody down for not liking this picture because of its explicit nature. This one took the more provocative route, and it suddenly runs as smooth as premium unleaded gasoline. The disturbing racial hatred that has changed America's societal infrastructure forever is how this picture is portrayed. With its correct state of mind, the movie is nonetheless disturbing as well as horrifyingly true, and shows itself on a very high pinpoint of accuracy. It walks a large step further in giving out a dramatic study of what can actually be a truthful account of the life of a racial hate crime syndicate, and how the lives of two adjusting individuals are shared. The violence is what makes this movie fully express the way society is being mistreated. Certainly speaking, it does go off the deep end and is not for the faint of heart, so that's all there is to know. One nice touch is the use of photography and its expression of colors, which is a good move for having the story tell itself with proper understanding. I really wanted more out of AMERICAN HISTORY X, but it's got rock-solid potential to keep its open-mindedness with a variety of moments."

I am just so excited about how good this movie, the way it shows both sides, for Neo-Nazi and opposed Neo-Nazi, and the way he got from one opinion to the other (prison). Not only this, but when it shows him with the Neo-Nazi's it makes it look like Nazi's are good and it sticks you in his shoes, it evenly plays victorious music during the racial basketball that kicked the blacks off his court and showed it like it was a good thing he did and he was hero, then it goes from B & W to color and shows he sees more clearly at what he did.

","I'd go so far as to say that it is one of the best films that I've ever seen in my life.  The reason I'm not afraid to make this statement is because I'm not judging it based on the technical aspects, but on the impact that it makes on the audience.<br/><br/>In all of my movie-going life, I've never been in a theatre where not one person spoke throughout the entire film -- until now.  Even when the film ended and the credits were slated to roll, the theatre remained completely silent as everyone simply stared at the screen in either awe or shock.<br/><br/>The range of emotions that this film hits is astounding.  Some of the most brutal imagery you'll ever see on film is captured in ""American History X"", imagery that will make you cringe.  But  at the same time, the character of Lamont (played excellently by Guy Torrey) will have you cracking up in laughter.  Edward Norton is fantastic as Derek Vinyard, illiciting from the audience feelings from hatred to sympathy, and even making the character likable in the end.<br/><br/>This film should win best picture, but it won't.  The subject matter is too grim for the Academy to bestow that honour upon it, even though the film is as deeply affecting as it is.  It simply steps on too many toes.  But Edward Norton should and probably will win best actor, because out of this somewhat dismal year for film, he simply shines in this performance."

The black&white/color aspect was interesting.

","Yesterday, I went to the local video shop and took out the AHX without having any idea what it was about.  I was totally unprepared for what I was to receive.<br/><br/>It's been a long time that a film has moved me to experience more than one emotion at the same time.  Anger, because of the violent killing of one of the black burglars.  Sadness, because of the moving moment when Dr. Sweeney asks Derek Vinyard if he had done anything to improve his life.  Humour, because of the grudging reluctance on the Derek's part to see the irrepressible Lamont as a human being.  I thought the performance given by Ed Norton was one that will never leave my mind and the film falls into the category of impact films such as Taxi-Driver, Made in Britain, Do the Right Thing, Jungle Fever and of course, Malcolm X.<br/><br/>But there were a few things that I wasn't happy with.  It bothered me that there was no rebuttal against Derek's powerful and challenging speech.  Here was an angry intelligent man articulating a lot of stuff but there was nobody, say, of Malcolm X calibre, to offset some of the things he was saying.  Especially at the dinner scene, Derek says so much that Murray (played by Elliot Gould) appears speechless which makes him look inept and weak.  I desperately wanted him to say or do something.  Even if that meant the scene ending with a physical fight between the two, at least it would give some satisfaction that Murray stood up to him.<br/><br/>The other thing that got on my nerves was the depiction of the black gangs. At the beginning of the film, we are introduced to two black youths committing an act of crime, later on in the film we see one of the youths elbowing Derek in the face in a game.  And then later, Derek gets his own back by brutally killing the same youth in the most barbaric way possible. My point is that what comes across is the contempt black males have for the law and whites, seems manipulated in such a way to justify Derek's heated rhetoric.  The liberal outlook of Dr. Sweeney with his 'two PhD's' plus the raw anger of the black gang is not enough to counteract Derek's diatribe.<br/><br/>Having said all of that, the cinematography was creative - the contrast between the black and white scenes juxtaposed against the coloured ones, the musical score was aptly appropriate successfully heightening emotional tension.  I look forward to seeing more films by Tony Kaye, and more films featuring Edward Norton.   Mr. De Niro and Mr. Pacino, it's time to move over!"

Edward Norton is Derek Vinyard a skinhead sent to prison for murdering two black boys in front of his home for trying to steal his truck. Norton's performance in American History X reminds me of an earlier film called Primal Fear. Edward Furlong plays Derek's younger brother named Danny. Danny, who has always looked up to Derek enters the life his brother Derek led. Derek leaves prison with the knowledge that Danny is in the hateful life he once led and he makes it his mission to get him and his family out of the life. American History X has a lot of detailed scenes of violence, and language that opened my eyes to this awful lifestyle. I thought to myself, How could people be so ignorant as to hate others because of their skin. When this film was first being released in theatres, there was a storm of controversy surrounding it due the violent and graphic content; however, American History X turned out to become even less violent than one of the most violent films of the 1990's Natural Born Killers. American History X was an eye opening, powerful, emotionally moving film that had everything from great acting to good plotlines. This is one of the top movies of 1998. Everybody who watches this film is in for a real treat because there is a twist at the end, which is needed to make the story come complete circle.

","THERE ARE MANY MORE RACES THAN THE BLACK AND THE WHITE<br/><br/>American History X is about racism, but more exclusively about the tensions between the white and black races, so deeply-rooted in the U.S.. Yes, black people make up the largest minority in that land - I believe about 10% of the population - but U.S. film-makers are becoming a little more awake, beginning to touch upon the lives of other races. For example, another 1998 film, ""Smoke Signals"" dealt with two Native people. American History X, thoughtfully touches - though in a low-key way - upon other races, like the Koreans who ""took over"" ownership of the grocery store.<br/><br/>When I was in the most racially diverse region of the world (the Caribbean), I observed how interracial marriage both preserves that diversity while creating unity. When a black person marries a white person, one child will come out completely black, one completely white, and one a beautiful mixture between the two. (Blondes and brunettes intermarry and we have not eradicated these hair colours creating an exclusively brown-haired society!)<br/><br/>RACISTS CANNOT BE REFORMED BY LOGIC<br/><br/>Some people were understandably upset that the film failed to ""rebut"" many of the arguments in favour of the Neo-Nazis. I thought that the brilliance of the film was that it subtly argued that this was futile. Rebuttals on one side are only met with rebuttals on the other and so the argument goes on back and forth endlessly. The arguments at the dinner table with the Elliot Gould character confirmed this. The film showed that reforming a racist is done not through appealing to his mind, his logic, his reason, but through his heart. Those that marvelled in wonderment over Derek's black laundry co-worker befriending him with humour about sex, thinking that it would have been more reasonable for him to argue racial issues failed to see this point I think.<br/><br/>The film pointed out how self-defeating the ideals of white supremacy (or supremacy of any race) are by showing how illogical the beliefs are. At one point, the younger brother states that it is best to steer clear away from anyone who is not a White Protestant in the midst of his insisting on doing away with Jews. Of course, the founder of Christianity, a faction of which is Protestantism, was a Jew! Another point that shows how self-defeating their beliefs are is that they want to do away with immigration. But their ancestors, themselves, were immigrants. All whites immigrated to the Americas from Europe. They never asked for permission from the Native people. The characters do take up this point and try to argue that the whites were good immigrants because they built up a great civilisation. But it is crystal clear how weak that argument is.<br/><br/>""American History X"" shows us that it is nearly futile to try to reform a racist by appealing to his faculty of reason, because his beliefs are not based upon reason, they are based upon emotional hatred. Derek's laundry co-worker began joking about an unrelated issue, an issue which Derek could not argue against and set up defences against his own point of view. The wall of hatred around his heart was penetrated. Blacks and whites actually had something in common that they could laugh about!  The mind can only be righted through appealing to the heart. This is the central message of ""American History X"".<br/><br/>NOT INTENDED TO BE A PSYCHOLOGICAL STUDY<br/><br/>Another criticism given to the film was that it was unclear how Derek was led down the path of racism. It was commented that it was initiated by his father using the 'n' word at the dinner table and by the fact that he was murdered by black people. It didn't seem to me that the film was saying that these were the exclusive reasons for Derek's embrace of racist views. It was just pointing out a few of the many fragments off of which he fed along this dark path. ""American History X"" was not aspiring to be a psychological study of how people become racists. It was simply revealing the darkness of racial hatred. I'm sure that such a psychological study could not be satisfactorily concluded in a two-hour non-documentary film; it is a complex issue. There is no one cause, and outside incidents are just a pat on the back, because everyone has free will to embrace whatever beliefs he chooses.<br/><br/>CONFUSION OF ECONOMIC VERSUS HUMAN ISSUES<br/><br/>Many people, also, seem to confuse economic issues with human ones. Racism is not a ""right-wing"" issue. ""Right-wing"" vs. ""left-wing"" are policies of economics. They have to do with such issues of public versus private ownership. A person can embrace the economic theory of capitalism and be a strong proponent of racial equality; while, another can side-with socialism and be a racist.<br/><br/>HOW DO YOU REMOVE DARKNESS FROM A ROOM?<br/><br/>The film's ending has its pro's and con's. One the one hand, yes, it is conventional, but on the other, it allows the film to leave an emotional impression on the viewer which helps him to reflect on all that he has seen.<br/><br/>In conclusion, ""American History X"" pointed out to me that hatred (""hate"" is the verb, ""hatred"" is the noun, please), like darkness, hatred cannot be depleted by attacking it. You can't remove darkness out of a room by shovelling it out, only by turning up the light of love which automatically dispels the darkness away.<br/><br/>The films advises that one should always end a piece of writing with a quote, so here's one. It is paraphrased from the sayings of Gandhi:<br/><br/>""If you simply take an eye for an eye, it won't be long before the whole world goes blind."" <br/><br/>(9 out of 10)"

Being half black half white I am very lucky to have not experienced too much racism in my life but this film really hit the core of racism in the US and everywhere else it was saying for once there is hostility from every race and also that people can CHANGE. The acting in this film is magnificent and Edward Norton is in what I think the best role he has ever played and Edward Furlong plays the adoring younger brother with his usual talent. The scenes with the flashbacks and when Norton is in Prison are shot in black and white and this is very effective for the main reason being like the same effect as The Wizard of Oz when Dorathy leaves Kansas and comes into color when she comes to Oz when Norton comes out of prison and has reformed his Nazi ways he is in color. The whole film is shot in a documentary style which in turn works very well because this film is so true to life and could easily be a film crew shooting a family. I found this film amazing and should be able to wake up all the Nazis racists and other backward people into realising that, that way of life can only end up in tears."

","One of the main strengths of American History X is that it portrays an urban American skinhead, not as a simple-minded fool that people can easily write off (this character actually appears as Seth, played by  Ethan Suplee), but as a complex character that is very close and very real.  This movie shows how easy it is for a smart and thoughtful sixteen year-old (played by Edward Norton) to go so terribly wrong.  Unfortunately, director Tony Kaye did not find it so easy to make Norton's transitions on film; although his stumbling transitions through Norton's character were made up for by Norton's and Edward Furlong's stellar performances.  No one can hide from this film's messages: not the Principal, teacher, police, and others in the film, but most of all, not the audience."

The only time I really see a lot of white people is when I'm at work, or out at the mall, or somewhere like that, so I don't really think about, or even give a damm about what they think of me, because it seems like most of them think bad about all of us anyway. Although I feel this way I've never had any hate for them, I just close my eyes to them, and let them think what they want, cause I always felt that they were going to feel this way no matter what, because the majority of them are raised thinking we are lower. It is obvious that there are good and bad in every race. But it is not often that someone with such hate in there heart, can have a change of heart. To the point were they view life differently. I liked how the older brother was able to release the hate, and make an effort to change his brothers life as well as his own. There were no sterotypes, or over use of the term NIGGER, which most white people don't even know the meaning of, but use anyway.

","In the eventual final cut that emerged from the celebrated editorial disputes, flaws and merits struggle for supremacy but the merits, I think, win over. On the down side, the treatment of Derek's ideological metamorphosis is a tad superficial (though understandably presented), and Tony Kaye's arty camerawork is sometimes used to overblown effect, as is the otherwise beautiful score. On the up side, there are fine individual scenes and excellent performances, and when the visuals do work they can be stunning - there can't be many films in which the opening credits themselves are a work of art. AHX is not perfect but it is affecting and more special than the typical multiplex movie-by-numbers. In a way, its flaws themselves could be seen to reflect its attempt to do something darker and original and not stick to safe guidelines."

"Willie-12","9","0","0","9 April 1999"," Powerful
","American History X is certainly one of the most powerful movies I have seen in a long time. I just watched it last night on video, and let me tell you it is still with me, and will be for some time to come. Hatred is senseless. This is what I have come away with after seeing this one. What is so sad about American History X, is even though it is a fictional story, it portrays a very realistic problem in our world. It is amazing how one can become so engulfed in hate, that they fail to see how the hatred is destroying them and the people around them. We think that the consequence of Derek's actions is a prison sentence, and the result is a wonderful rehabilitation that is going to change not only his life, but his brother's too, who is headed down the same hate-filled road that Derek was headed down. However, we come to find that life doesn't work that way. Indeed, the hate filled seeds that Derek sowed before prison have blossomed, and the consequences are more then he could have ever imagined. American History X is a great movie because of how painfully real it is, and it doesn't pull any punches. It lets us know just how senseless hatred is...any kind of hate. You see, just because this movie happened to be about white supremacism, doesn't mean that it doesn't apply to everyone. I think the bottom line is this: Any hatred toward anyone can bring you down. It leads to emptiness, and destruction, and can bring about events that will ultimately kill you emotionally, and maybe even literally."

I am not a particular Edward Furlong fan yet he does a nice job as the junior Hitler-in-waiting with readily available smart-a$$ grin. The rest of the supporting cast is good, but it is Norton who shines in a performance that was definitely worthy of his Oscar consideration.

Pent up rage looking for the quickest and easiest exit, Racism. Edward Norton is brilliant. No other words are adequate to describe him. He was hate, anger, and remorse in every scene. The writing was especially good aswell. I was lost in the total rhetoric of his dinner tirade. I found myself even agreeing with him. Which is why this film is so important for us all to see. Young minds are so much easier to mold to a certain way of thinking. We are not born hating people, we learn it, we are shown it, we are immersed in it everyday of our lives.

Edward Norton is phenomenal in his portrayal of Derek Vinyard.  My fear is that the press from the director will scare people away. The irony is that scaring people away from ""American History X"" would be as much a crime as scaring people away from ""Saving Private Ryan"". AHX isn't a perfect movie; there are a couple minor disconnects in the plot.

"navyfrog","10","0","0","7 April 1999"," The answers are endless
","This is a powerful movie with a harsh reality overshadowing it to great effect.  The hateful rhetoric becomes almost plausible as you listen to Derek's (Edward Norton) views at the dinner table, or his recruitment campaign to the other young neo-Nazis.  The writer/director cohorts do an impressive job of accentuating the vicious circle of racism, and the actor portraying the main character, Edward Norton, carries out a brilliant performance worth remembering.<br/><br/>I found the symbolic effects used throughout the movie were very effective, some being more subtle than others.  The most obvious was the use of black and white film for the flashbacks, when Derek (Norton) was a neo-Nazi, and the contradicting use of colour when he was released from prison, reformed. The suggestion that everything was black and white for him when he had his racist, bigot and white-power beliefs; everything was so clear and sensible to him; he was right, they were wrong, was ambitious and significant.  White was good; black, or any other tone for that matter, was bad.  The switch to colour during scenes when he was reformed was a hint at the refreshing nature of what life can be when you look at it from a different angle, when you take down your wall of hatred.<br/><br/>Another little symbolic reference was the bowl of jellybeans.  Seth picked out the one black one before chugging down the whole bowl of white ones. Although at first glance it may seem like a joke, as if you think he's picking out one jellybean to eat it, but as a reference to his excessively overweight condition, swallows the majority of the candy, if you think for a second it's fairly easy to spot the white/black ratio, and his reaction to it.<br/><br/>One other quick symbolic gesture was Derek's move at the coffee shop near the end of the movie.  He held open a door for a woman who was not white. Quite subtle, but effective.  There were quite a few other events or items with a similar purpose that I noticed at the time I was watching the movie, but which I unfortunately cannot remember at this moment.<br/><br/>To end this ferociously long spiel on American History X, I just wanted to respond to a comment that another IMDB member who reviewed this movie said:<br/><br/>""So neo-Nazism isn't the answer, but what is?  The movie leaves you dangling on this point, not really resolving anything.""<br/><br/>But that's the exact point. Nothing is resolved in this world.  People look for answers in the wrong places, and most of the time never find them. Leaving the movie unresolved, yet establishing a blockade against neo-Nazism is not, in my opinion, unrealistic or unfurnished quality.  Nay, in fact, it's the opposite.  It IS realistic, because whether you search for answers in religion or gangs or hate, etc. etc. etc., you aren't going to find it. The answer to life is within yourself.  And the answers are endless.  I feel that's what this movie was trying to explain."

","Great film.  Makes you think.  But, I have one complaint.  The portrayal of the father at the end showed that the racism began at the family dinner table.  However, it wasn't necessary to blur the difference between rational, non-racist views (a distaste for affirmative action) with purely racist views (use of the ""n"" word).  Many non-racist people disagree with the principal of affirmative action, including many people of color, but you wouldn't know it from this film.  Why not portray at least one character (such as the sister perhaps) in the film that holds non-racist, but conservative views?  It is possible! It does exist!  This movie makes a great statement against racism. My one complaint is that it perpetuates the standard Hollywood myth that Conservatism equals racism.  It doesn't -- and someday I'd like to see a movie that acknowledges that fact."

","This is a thorough disappointment, which is a shame, because it had potential, and the performances throughout are excellent. But it is politically naive, re-hashing old arguments and bringing nothing new to the debate. The directing is sometimes infuriatingly annoying, there are way too many ""slow-down-watch-as-drips-of-water/sweat-drop-off-my-face"" kind of shots, and the film is slow and not particularly dynamic. All the black guys in the film are portrayed as being bad, except the educated black man, who is the teacher - he is allowed to be good, because he is intelligent. I find that unfair. Where American History X also fails, is it takes a very conventional line... guy is a Nazi, guy is bad, guy gets put in prison, guy realizes error, guy gets out and is a good guy now... oh dear... there's a pay-off. Another irritation is where the film tries to delve a little deeper - why is Norton's character a racist, Nazi, bigot? Ooh I know, let's blame it on the father. Weak stuff indeed, a shame, because Norton and Furlong both appear to be exceptionally talented actors."
"Aidy","9","0","0","30 March 1999"," Powerful, pointless
","I'd like to start by saying that this is a fantastic movie that you should go and see.  It is gripping 100% of the way through.  The acting is superb, the imagery is breathtaking, the violence is thoroughly brutal.<br/><br/>However I did have some gripes about the actual intent of the movie.  The story follows the lives of Derek (Edward Notron) and Danny (Edward Furlong) Vinyard.  Danny, the younger brother of Derek, is instructed to study the life of his brother after he submits a paper on Mein Kampf for school. Danny looks up to and admires his brother and they are both neo-Nazis. Derek ends up in prison after a race related manslaughter, yet his time in prison shows him the error of his ways and after release he attempts to reform his younger brother as he himself has been reformed.<br/><br/>The first part of the movie explores Derek as a character and his white power motivation and ideas.  Derek is not your stereotypical thug.  He is intelligent and articulate.  The whole first section presents both racism against whites and racism against blacks.  Both black and white are seen to be equally discriminatory and violent, a war of two equal sides.  Yet we only ever see the motives of the neo-Nazis.  We are given the propaganda that the neo-Nazis feed on, social problems are dredged up and the blacks and immigrants are blamed for all of it and Derek is Hell-bent on putting those wrongs right.  Apart from the awful violence there are no strong reasons given why Derek is in any way 'wrong.'  We have no real reason to hate or despise him, after all the men he killed were trying to kill him. His father was killed by black people as he tried to save their lives. This whole idea prevails...both 'sides' are 'wrong' yet both are justified<br/><br/>In prison, however, Derek becomes disillusioned with his 'own kind' and turns from them realising they have shallow motives and are unguided.  He feels the thugs in prison don't share his ideas; they are simply thugs. He decides to become a loner, neither friends with the white gang or the black gang.  This leaves him wide open as to even survive you have to take at least one side.  The only reason he makes it out alive is due to a friendship he develops with a black inmate.<br/><br/>This is the rather flimsy basis of his conversion.  Separated from everyone he begins to realise that he has been fed a lie and vows to distance himself from his former gang lifestyle.<br/><br/>It is all-well and good seeing that Derek is no longer a racist thug...but what about all of the white-power ideas?  All of the social problems that Derek points out still exist in society.  Nothing he says throughout the movie is rebutted.  So neo-Nazism isn't the answer, but what is?  The movie leaves you dangling on this point, not really resolving anything.<br/><br/>Another interesting point was the cinema dynamics.  I can't remember any other movie where I have squirmed in my seat, practically ashamed to be white.  Half way through the movie I was praying that all would turn out good lest I be lynched outside...it really is that powerful.  However as both black and white exchanged words onscreen I squirmed as 'my race' demonstrated their racism toward the blacks, yet the black members of the audience felt it acceptable to laugh out loud as the onscreen blacks were racist toward the whites...<br/><br/>So I would like to finish by saying that not only was I practically ashamed of being white, I am proud to say that at least I was ashamed."

","I was completely stunned by this film - which not only tells a story of how hate acts as a cycle but also tells a rich story of a grieving family. The film is violent but not, in my opinion, gratuitous in any way, and brilliantly depicts its two main characters as complete people - viciously confused racists who are irrational kids fuming with misplaced anger. The origins of the hatred spread by Edward Norton and Furlong's characters and the actions they take are neither excused by the film nor apologized for - this film dares to take the issue of violence and truly strip it down to an individual level. Edward Norton is not only a genius in his role but is also very brave to have taken on a character who is at once so completely dislikeable yet somehow sympathetic - a challenge that could have easily backfired.<br/><br/>I couldn't believe ""American History X"" presented the arguments that it did and I still can't believe the ending - anyone who enjoyed ""Pulp Fiction' but thinks the violence in this film is inexcusable ought to really think about why.

Alleged director Tony Kaye should be grateful to New Line for taking away this ad-hoc piece o' crud, which he admits he winged from a script he never even liked. (Gods of videotape and DVD, please spare us his cut, which he never completed, by the way.) From the very first frames, it's clear that Kaye has no rapport with his actors, and has zero idea how to get decent, let alone consistent, performances out of them. As the buffed-up skinhead leader, Norton tries hard, but he has three different personalities in the film, with the transitions between them either patently phony or (mostly) non-existent. A worthy subject, but this ""X""ecrable effort proves why some people are cut out to do 30-second commercials and not grandiose ""masterpieces"".

"oOoBarracuda","2","3","9","29 December 2016"," American History X
","American History X acted as my introduction to Tony Kaye and didn't leave me thirsting for any more of his work. The 1998 film, was his directorial debut, and that fact showed. The film stars Edward Norton as a former white supremacist reformed after a jail sentence who now wants to help his brother, played by Edward Furlong, avoid traveling the same path. What the film lacks in character depth it makes up for in its overarching moral message. American History X is devoid of all real human complexity in favor of the easy and overly simple message against racism without ever actually showing much in the way of race relations. Everything about American History X is safe, and safe films are rarely remembered years after their release.<br/><br/>Edward Norton's Derek Vinyard, an easily mentally manipulated young man living in the increasingly diverse Venice Beach area of Los Angelis, California. Early one morning, Derek's brother, Danny (Edward Furlong) alerts his brother that his car is being broken into by ""some black guy"". Derek answers by loading a gun then heading outside in his underwear firing as soon as the door is open. Derek is arrested and sentenced to serve three years in prison. He bars his family and friends from visiting him while he is in prison, leaving everyone shocked when a completely transformed Derek emerges. When the white supremacist group that he used to head throws a party for his release, Derek wants no part of it and only attends the party to warn his former mentor to stay away from his brother and sever ties with everyone there. Derek's time is now spent trying to get his life back on track, find a job, and keep himself out of jail. His purpose, however, is to keep his brother, who idolizes Derek and watched his every move for years, out of the racism-fueled group that he fostered. He must impart his new-found enlightenment on his brother before it is too late. <br/><br/>Aside from the glaring plot deficiencies, American History X is shot in a painful way. The heavy reliance on extreme close-up and often off-centered shots miss the grittiness the director may have been going for and is instead nauseating. The memories shot in black & white came off incredibly gimmicky and really didn't serve the advancement of the narrative in any way. The transition from black & white memories to present-day color shots was far from smooth and was rather distracting. American History X is not the type of film that requires a voice- over, yet, it was voiced-over throughout the entire film. Even if a film doesn't need a voice-over, it's easier to forgive if there is a succulent voice providing the narration; American History X does not have this either. There is a heavy reliance on the shots of this film to provide a shock factor, rather than the narrative itself which is indicative of poor directing when you're working with a plot as explosive as race relations. Back to the plot, the audience is told all throughout the film that Derek is smart, but we are never shown that. Twice through the movie, the audience is shown just how little it takes to emotionally and mentally manipulate Derek, leaving one to wonder if his ""transformation"" will even be permanent. The betrayal in the final scene may be just another manipulation to push Derek back to his old ways of vitriol hate. There's just not much to take away from Tony Kaye's feature film debut, which is disappointing considering that it could have been a masterclass in cinema, given its premise."

Plus who can forget that moment early on in the movie where he stomps.OMFG! That was the most gangsta move ever depicted in a movie at the time!

"AlexWannaBeBee","10","2","5","28 February 2015"," Released on parole after murdering two black men, a neo-Nazi attempts to reform.
","American History X is a fine film, which has at its dark centre a towering performance that establishes Edward Norton as the most promising character actor of his generation.<br/><br/>Told through the eyes of his admiring brother (a perfectly cast Furlong), American History X charts the rise, if that's the right word, of Derek Vinyard (Norton) a fiercely intelligent young man who, after the shooting of his father by a black man, and encouraged by sinister good ol' boy Cameron (Stacy Keach), shaves his head, has a swastika tattooed on his chest and proceeds to galvanise the local disenchanted youth into forming a racist gang before murdering two black men who were attempting to steal his car. When Derek returns on parole after three years of his sentence, his brother David (Furlong), whose doe-eyed puppyish looks bely his own gestating violent racism, is horrified to find that his brother has been reformed in jail and has not only grown back his mane but is determined to redress some of the harm he has done. Which is not a policy popular with his gang, which has gathered to welcome him back as a conquering hero.<br/><br/>Neo-Nazidom has a short though distinguished history on the big screen. Alan Clarke's Made In Britain and Australian director Geoffrey Wright's Romper Stomper both took an uncomfortable look inside the heads of racist thugs. Yet American History X's strength is not its subject matter but Edward Norton's ballistic performance. Despite a weak backstory (Derek's rage apparently having its genesis in childhood after a few bigoted comments uttered by his dad, while his equally implausible moral reversal comes from ""meeting a nice black fella"" in jail), Norton manages to deliver one of the most convincing racists ever while retaining his character's humanity. Even after he kills - and in doing so commits to celluloid one of the most sadistically shocking acts of violence in the medium's history (if, that is, all the footage of this pre-release cut survives the attentions of the BBFC) - Norton manages to preserve the shred of humanity that carries us through his redemption and prevents us from simply dismissing him as worthless scum.<br/><br/>Kaye's direction occasionally veers a little too close to his advertising roots; extensive use of slo-mo - particularly, for some reason, in showers that begin to resemble shampoo ads - and black- and-white lend a chic patina, which some may think is a little overcooked. And, in between set pieces, he flounders slightly, though this may be a symptom of the re-edit. Another may be the ending, in which Kaye seems to lose faith with the power of his own movie and delivers what could be seen as a cheap twist in place of a considered conclusion.<br/><br/>But in themselves the set pieces are astonishing. A brutal attack on a convenience store, a gruelling prison rape sequence, and a dinner party argument that erupts into violence are all edited with sustained barnstorming energy."

","This is probably one of the deepest films made in years. Edward Norton made an incredible lead performance that drives the movie well. This film can be hard to watch at times and it may not be for everyone with its intense action and violence but the overall message of the movie is well thought out and is quite moving. Even the most violent of people can change as seen by Derek when he becomes friends with a black man when he was in prison. Behind all the violence lies a great message that is pretty motivational. Its plot details how black and white people despise each other and often get in fights and even kill each other. The movie details how brothers Derek and Danny both try to turn themselves around from their harsh life. All of their friends are racist and both of them fear their friends turning on them if they try to leave their gang. The ending is tragic and it's hard to watch. It gets me every time but it's fitting. This is a really amazing film. It has a great story and a great message. All of this combines to make one of the best movies in the 90's. As long as you can get by the gore and action then this will likely be a film for you. This is a must see film for all fans of drama movies."

","I don't think this is ONLY about Edward Norton's shifting attitudes towards white supremacy or American Naziism or whatever the organization is called here. Maybe that was the producers' intent when this was made in 1997, when some of the public were still hearing for the first time about the Aryan Brotherhood and all that.<br/><br/>If the object was not just to entertain us but to teach us that racist-inspired violence is utterly wrong, the message seems not to have gotten through. We don't have race riots very often but the country is now polarized and angrier than I can remember, at least since Vietnam. The engine propelling that hatred now is not so much race, although that plays a part, but political ideology. One end of the political spectrum is so consumed by anger that the fantasies on which that outrage is based has come to look as anomalous as Norton's original notions of Aryan supremacy. In some cases, it's downright loco.<br/><br/>Norton is a skinhead in an ordinary American family, though he himself is anything but ordinary. He belongs to a group led by Stacey Keach that meets in some kind of garage draped with Nazi flags. Norton's body is covered with tattoos of barbed wire and, featured prominently, a Swastika on his chest. This part of the movie -- the introduction and many flashbacks -- is in black and white.<br/><br/>When a black gang burglarizes a house in his neighborhood, one of the gang is wounded and helpless. The shirtless and bemuscled Norton strides over to him and stomps his head against the curb, removing with one stomp all of the guy's front teeth. He's arrested and sent to prison. Norton's actions sound pretty bad to most of us, but evidently not to all of us. Ten years after this movie's release, a Texan named Joe Horn saw his neighbor's house being burglarized by two Mexicans and called the police, who said cars were on the way. Against the instructions of the police, Horn announced, ""This ain't right,"" took his shotgun, went out on his lawn and said, ""Freeze -- or you're dead."" Two men tried to run away and Horn shot and killed them, later to be cleared of any charges.<br/><br/>Norton's spell in prison rearranges his attitudes. Initially hostile to the black and Mexicans he is forced to live with, he finally begins to chuckle over a black colleague's absurd jokes in the laundry room. And, with the cooperation of the corrections officers, Norton is beaten and raped in the shower room by whites, in a particularly brutal scene. He emerges reformed and tries to save his younger brother from treading the same path. The scenes after his release from the slams are shot in color.<br/><br/>The writing is sometimes rather clever. Elliot Gould plays a polite, vaguely ""live-and-let-live"" kind of Jew who is courting Norton's mother. Over the dinner table, the unregenerate Norton tweaks him about his attitude towards the Rodney King incident and is allowed to make some points. (What if King were white and the cops were all blacks?) The mother tries to put an end to the growing argument -- ""What about some ICE CREAM?"" -- and there follow about 30 seconds of a well-scripted and sublimely awkward silence. But the fight has acquired its own momentum, as combat has a tendency to do. Norton is hijacked by his amygdala and shouts poor Gould down so that Gould must leave the house and the widow he's courting. Norton's extreme attitudes have corrupted his manners at the table and perhaps wrecked his mother's chances for remarriage.<br/><br/>I don't want to go on about this. Norton is actually pretty good. The character's attitudes are ironbound but Norton isn't stupid at all. Stacey Keach is a stereotype and is shown as such. When he laughs heartily at some racist remark, the camera practically dives down his throat. I haven't seen so many teeth since ""Jaws."" The writers have been careful to indicate that Norton's pre-prison personality has nothing to do with the Ku Klux Klan -- ""a bunch of illiterate rednecks."" Why not, asks the curious viewer, since the ideologies are almost the same? Well, answer the producers, we don't want to align the KKK with this despicable racist because we don't know how many KKK members are out there but we do know that they buy movie tickets.<br/><br/>I really doubt that anyone learned much from watching Norton's rehabilitation or reformation or whatever it was. We can't identify with him. He's too extreme and obnoxious in all respects. We might learn more from a movie about Joe Horn, his killing of two unarmed burglars at somebody else's house, and his subsequent vindication by the courts. I'm sure Joe Horn had good table manners and loved his dog. We can see us in him."
"secondtake","7","2","5","8 January 2010"," Gripping and intense, and Norton is fabulous enough to rise above the clichés
","American History X (1998)<br/><br/>Well, Edward Norton is so astonishing, and almost scarily convincing, you can overlook a lot of the well worn themes that guide the plot. In fact, all of the acting is strong, especially the little brother to Norton's skinhead character, an up and coming skinhead played by Edward Furlong. <br/><br/>The movie is covers basically a 24-hour period, but a good half of the screen time is flashbacks, presented in black and white to great effect. Not only does this help us keep track of what we are watching (the different lengths of hair help, too), but it adds pure style to what is basically a violent crime and prison film. It's fast, well edited, and filled with powerful social imagery and gut-wrenching interpersonal scenes.<br/><br/>Crime and prison life form the backdrop for the two main things that give the movie depth. The first is obvious, maybe--race issues between blacks and skinhead whites in Venice Beach. It gets painfully oversimplified, maybe out of necessity in less than two hours, but it works well enough. The second is more important--the love and mutual admiration between two brothers. They are just kids, really, though Norton's role is very adult by the end. Their interactions are the best thing the movie has, and luckily they permeates everything, beginning to end. <br/><br/>Clichés in this kind of world might be inevitable in this kind of mainstream movie, but if the African Americans are especially cardboard in their depictions, Norton's portrayal of justified racism really chilling, and the interactions within his family complex and revealing. The other Hollywood plot elements are things you just have to go along with. The kinds of good guys and bad guys, suffering mother and angry sister, the prison culture and street culture, and even the use of guns everywhere are not far from some Italian-American mobster movie, and I suppose that's partly just the truth of it. But it also seems a little easy, a rewriting of a common set of circumstances.<br/><br/>Too common. Which is part of the point. You sometimes wish there wasn't a message to every movie like this--American History X is heavy on the moralizing--but the message is a slam dunk. The movie will leave you reeling."

"jazzadelic","6","2","5","13 October 2001"," good film that could have been great
","Racists in movies usually don't get treated like real characters in films. Usually they're seen as the guys in white masks that nobody ever who never even get to utter more then a few cliche lines. My guess as to why is that in an age of political correctness most filmmakers are afraid to dig deep into the psyche of the average racist. In Happiness, film makers showed a pedophile without judgement. In Silence of the Lambs Anthony Hopkins portrayed a serial killer who is not only treated like a real character but is actually likeable! If they can do that in a film then surely should be able to make a film that portrays racism in a realistic and thought provoking manner. American History X is a good movie for that reason. It is the first film since Spike Lee's ""Do the Right Thing"" that deals with racism in a frank and open way and is unafraid of offending it's audience. What keeps ""American History X"" from being a great film (like ""Do the Right Thing"")is that some of the characters' actions seem contrived to fit the plot. Edward Norton's character is awfully wishy washy for a guy with deeply felt convictions. In one scene, he's talking about how much he hates blacks, then joking around with a black is enough to make him the picture of love and acceptance. Also, the film has a shock ending that does not make sense and confuses the message of the movie."

PS- I could have done without the prison rape scene, and could have seen some more of Fairuka Balk sex scenes would have been nice!
Leftists always give you the same ad-hominem attacks... ""These are people who think that time has passed them by..."", or, ""Racists do what they do because they are insecure""... bla bla bla!
I love the scene at the dinner table, where the guy who's the Jew dating the lead's mother says, ""these are people that feel alienated by the system""....
Oh please, spare me!! The only thing that matters in this world, that matters to God, is the actions that you take!! Your own internal dialogue, as this character seems to be suggesting, is something that dominates our personality in the end, and there is no free will. But since not everyone acts on those impulses, the results of our actions are the only tangible things others can see!!
That being said, this movie is entirely believable, and the main character completely justified. This film seems to take the left-wing, communist path of ""destroy the individual, by attacking his motivations and not his actions.""
Communist liberals don't really care that there are dead bodies in the streets... they care about tearing down the concept of right and wrong... Case in point? Derek, the main character, becoming overly violent on the night in question that landed him in jail on murder charges. Ask yourself: would Derek have been a hero if he had simply shot the guy who broke into his truck, to leftists? No, he would not have been!! He would have been a hero if he had left the guy go and steal his truck. Why? Because, leftist communists are hypocrites, and believe in ""one standard for those who help bring about the divide, and another for those who call for the same standards of behavior for all."" Communists can only come to power when society is divided. Then, they sneak in and steal the country while people are looking to fight each other, and not them!! Hence, the real racists are on the left!!! What does all this mean? It means, you cannot put a guy like Derek through the loss of his father, constant harassment in life, and expect him to react as a pacifist. As it is, the film only serves, in my humble opinion, to further the divide. The real statement of this movie is: There is one standard of behavior for blacks and other minorities, and an entirely other standard for whites (which is to say: bend over and take it because we have had it too good for too long!)>>....."

Much of the movie (the black and white part) focuses on Derek's life before and during prison. He goes to any and all lengths to prevent his brother Danny from going down the same wrong path. From an act Danny does early on in the movie, he pays the ultimate price at the end.<br/><br/>To think that American History X wasn't even nominated for best picture is really, not just shocking, but strange too.

It is raw, in your face, unapologetic and as real as it gets. The main message of the movie is about mistakes and about history repeating itself.

","While scrolling through IMDb, I stumbled across American History X. Intrigued by the plot summary, I decided to watch the movie with high expectations. Those high expectations were shattered with the incredible acting, heart wrenching, and soul churning scenes that unfold. This movie is extraordinary in every aspect. I enjoyed every aspect of the movie and would watch it again. The ending takes a stab into the viewers emotions, showing us the untimely death of our would-be protagonist. The scene only worsens when Derek rushes to the school and finds his younger brother lying dead in the urinal. The screams, shrieks, and cries from Derek nearly brought me to tears. The journey he had undergone, though revolutionary, was not enough to save his younger brother from the fate that was already sealed from following in his path of being a Neo-Nazi.<br/><br/>The journey that is shown throughout the movie, switching from black and white to color, beautifully shows the outlook on life which Derek abides by, separating those who are not White Protestants from anyone else. The color change is extraordinary to convey his character transformation.<br/><br/>The ending, as stated before, is one of the best scenes in the movie, pulling at the heart strings of the reader. Danny's fate is sealed once he blows the puff of smoke into the face of the African American student. This fate was carried out by Danny by worshiping the actions and ideology in which his older brother, Derek, dominated.<br/><br/>The opening scene of the car robbery set the mood for the rest of the movie, not pulling back any punches when it came to brutality. The opening scene, however, also showed the contempt that Danny has for the final actions of Derek. Derek's murder of two African American men attempting to break into his car changed Danny forever. This change, however, is suppressed by Danny in order to be more like his brother. When Danny discovers the massive change in Derek, his frustration is let out by pushing him against a garage many times. This anger seems to be coming from the confusion Danny now faces on whether to follow his brother again or stick to what he made himself believe.<br/><br/>All in all, this is an amazing movie and I would recommend this to any friend."

","One can change and roll back whatever his past for good. It has nothing to with the surrounding you live but within yourself. Every Man and Woman can change for good and be good. Its a universal message which this film is based on. That idea is taken to the viewers minds really smoothly but with a greater sensitive depth. <br/><br/>Film scored only 7 from me as it lacked failed to emotionally grab the viewer as much as i hope. It talks to the brain but fails to capture the heats entirely. Nevertheless it is a fine movie to watch and rethink about ourselves."

"cvijic-58983","10","1","2","7 January 2018"," My history X
","Anything before or after TV show Lost didn't start such as emotions as this film.I don't know where to start from...
HATE ...mine was nationalism type and for one time my whole childhood was under nationalism.I didn't learn from parents or anyone, we kids learn it on streets. It's ridiculous how you can HATE someone that you don't even know and we as kids didn't even know why. But human needs HATE, he needs a group of people with same ideas who would make him part of something, part of something bigger, so he can be someone. 
One period in my sixteen years long life, I was under influence of Adolf Hitler and that whole concept of national socialism and I need to confess that I was attracted to it.I had anger, fury spreading through my veins and it wasn't race anger or nationalism anger, but it needed a way to express himself and it found nazism, idea that is made of anger and fury. Scary thing is that, even yesterday when I watched this movie, I can see some truth in the philosophy of Derek Vinyard, main character of this masterpiece.My anger was HATE - HATE against system, capitalism, Church, manipulation, television and to everything that controls human and slows him down.
By the way, main actor in this movie is Edward Norton.This is one of the greatest performances I've ever seen.He got so deeply in his character, that scene on beginning where cops arrest him, there is something that makes me sick.It shows the man who is lost in HATE, who is so certain in his procedures that he doesn't realise that he is just a pawn to someone bigger, more powerful.He was so proud of himself that he didn't see his little brother who was watching him doing that crime.So bizarre.
End of the movie is great.It doesn't matter how hard you try, you can't fight the HATE.And it doesn't matter if one side is trying to fight it because HATE always needs two sides. 
I'm imagining the end where Norton is shaving his head where we can see the full circle of HATE.<br/><br/>And message at the end, DON'T HATE, it's worth it, life is too short for that. Is the black man's fault that in Sahara there is like 50 Celsius and he evolved to protect his skin.<br/><br/>My top5 movie

"tomgillespie2002","6","1","2","4 October 2017"," Despite the glaring flaws, American History X still retains its raw power
","Watching American History X again 19 years after its release, the sight of Edward Norton's enigmatic frame captured in stark black- and- white quickly reminded me of just why I loved the film so much, and why it was one of the first DVDs I purchased when the transition from VHS was starting to take hold. I was 13 when I first saw the film in 1998, and now I'm 32 with more life experience and many, many more movies under my belt, the cracks and problems with Tony Kaye's tale of brotherly love and neo-Nazism also became apparent. It was something I could never quite put my finger on as a youngster, but the film's main issue is with trying to resolve a lifetime of hate and dysfunction in a single night, and by setting itself such time constraints, over-simplifies an incredibly complex and sensitive subject, although its heart is certainly in the right place.<br/><br/>American History X tells the story of two brothers; Derek (Norton), a charismatic and hardened skin-head freshly released from prison following a brutal double-murder, and Danny (Edward Furlong), an intelligent kid following in the doomed footsteps of the older sibling he admires so much. Danny has just written a paper on Adolf Hitler, glorifying the fascist leader as a civil rights hero. His (black) schoolteacher Dr. Sweeney (Avery Brooks) is outraged, but sets Danny the task of penning a paper on his brother, who had walked free that very morning. Hurrying home to reunite with his hero, Danny finds his brother a changed man. Derek has grown his hair, and no longer proudly displays the swastika tattooed on his torso. Something happened in prison that allowed Derek to let go of his misguided hate, and sets about ensuring that Danny doesn't follow the same path by confronting hate teacher and former ally Cameron (Stacy Keach).<br/><br/>This impeccably-performed and suitably rough-around-the-edges movie is far more successful with depicting Derek's rise to legend-status amongst his gang than it is with handling his drastic change of heart. Despite a rather silly basketball game, the bulk of the black-and- white flashbacks offer a keen and convincing insight into the mind of a highly-intelligent leader of men who has inherited prejudice and hate. When he enters prison following the shocking murder, Derek becomes torn between the hypocritical Aryan Brotherhood and his laundry-room work mate Lamont (Guy Torry). These moments, which are supposed to convince us that a man of Derek's single-mindedness could learn the error of his ways, are reduced to a handful of clumsily-written conversations and a particularly nasty rape. It ultimately fails to deliver on its initial promise, and whether this uneven narrative was the result of Norton being brought in to help with the final edit, causing Kaye to completely disown the film, I couldn't tell you. Despite the glaring flaws, American History X still retains its raw power, and Norton gives a performance of such staggering intensity that he will likely never best it."

"ksutich","9","1","2","13 June 2017"," I was reminded of the sheer power of this movie by watching it years later with my teenager.
","I originally watched this movie so many years ago and was floored by it. I had forgotten how many emotions it wrangles out of you that you may not even ever suspect. It was an eye opening movie for me as a younger person and when I found out my 19 year old boy hadn't seen it, I pulled out my DVD of it and said, ""That's what we're doing tonight."" He at first had no interest in it after checking out the synopsis on the case and I almost had to force him to watch it with me. However, as I began to get immersed in this movie that I had forgotten its powers, it got quiet and I never heard another word from him. At the end of the movie, I was sniffling and I look over and he is sitting on the edge of the couch with tears, unspilled, but sitting in his eyes, mouth open, slack-jawed, and still staring at the blank screen. It was definitely a defining period in his young adulthood and a moment for me that helped define our relationship and that I'll always cherish. It's a classic that even now sometimes I talk to people who haven't seen it, and I recommend it. I'm glad I bought the DVD so long ago. It had the same reaction for me as it did the first time years ago.<br/><br/>I don't want to let out spoilers and it's so hard with this movie. So that's why I haven't gone into detail. But if you want to see real, emotional, life changing in certain situations, movies that make you question things and/or really force you to put yourself into someone else's shoes whether you want to or not, watch this movie."
"Wuchakk","8","1","2","22 February 2017"," Brutal, visceral drama on hateful tribalism and escape
","Released in late 1998 and directed by Tony Kaye from David McKenna's script, ""American History X"" is an urban drama about a former neo-Nazi leader, Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton), who tries to prevent his younger brother, Danny (Edward Furlong), from taking the same path of hate he did. Current events are shown in color whereas flashbacks are depicted in B&W. Stacy Keach plays the behind-the-scenes mentor of the neo-Nazis while Avery Brooks appears as Danny's principal. Elliott Gould is on hand as a Jewish history teacher who is interested in Danny's mother (Beverly D'Angelo).<br/><br/>During the first half I found some of the dramatics dubious, to be nice; you can tell that kinks needed worked out in the script or the acting. After viewing the movie, I found out that the director felt the same way, insisting that the film needed more work; he also objected to Norton re-editing scenes without his approval and even wanted his name removed from the credits.<br/><br/>If you can roll with the palpable flaws, however, you'll likely find yourself immersed in the world of the characters by the second half. While the topic is unpleasant and there are some hard scenes to watch, ""American History X"" shoots for greatness and in some ways grasps it. For instance, there are a few moving, artistically-staged sequences, like the aftermath of the dinner-scene-from-hell and the climax. This is what I look for in great dramas, but rarely get. Norton's powerful performance is another example of the film's greatness.<br/><br/>Someone criticized the movie on the grounds that it simplifies complex issues, but how else can you tackle a subject like this and do it justice in a 2-hour movie while keeping it entertaining? Besides, nothing was so simplified to be unbelievable, as far as Derek's character arc goes. Someone else panned the narration, but – aduh – I guess he didn't get that the words are Danny's essay assignment for his new ""class"" with the principal, which explain the movie's title.<br/><br/>The overriding theme is that that all races/ethnicities tend to stick together and are in an undeclared war. The skinheads aren't really singled out because the movie plainly shows that their hostilities are mirrored in the other gangs, albeit with different verbiage and accouterments. While antagonistic tribalism is rampant it can't stand in the face of genuine relationship and the corresponding love and respect.<br/><br/>ADDITIONAL CAST: Fairuza Balk plays Derek's girlfriend while Jennifer Lien and William Russ appear as his sister and father. Guy Torry is on hand as an inmate Derek slowly befriends while Ethan Suplee plays a hulking neo-Nazi.<br/><br/>The film runs 119 minutes and was shot entirely in Los Angeles (Venice, Venice Beach, Fairfax, North Hollywood).<br/><br/>GRADE: A-"
"fezmendoza","7","1","2","1 December 2016"," American History X is a powerful film depicting neo-Nazism and racism in America
","American History X<br/><br/>Delivering a powerful and controversial plot, American History X tells the story of a neo-Nazi, Californian resident, Danny Vinyard, who serves time for brutally killing three African-Americans that were breaking into his truck. The movie takes place in the 24-hour period after Danny's release from prison but also shows many plot-defining flashbacks, shown in black and white. Danny Vinyard, casted as Edward Norton, shows a full range of emotion and motive from the beginning of this movie to the end. Vinyard begins this movie by showing the audience what they expected to see: a racist, hate-filled man with no hope to change his beliefs. When his younger brother, Derek, alerts him that there are three black kids breaking into his truck, Norton grabs his gun and, without any caution for backlash, makes his way downstairs to bring what he thinks is justice to the young men outside. When authorities arrive and tell Norton to get down on his knees, he complies, lays his gun on the ground and looks at his brother. Norton knows he won't be able to speak with Derek so he says all he needs to say in this one, powerful and gut-wrenching look. At first he smiles, as to tell his younger brother that he is proud of what he's done and looks as though he even took enjoyment out of killing these men. Then he narrows his eyes and looks deep into his brother's own and without moving his lips at all, Danny lets his brother know that he must carry the torch while he is away.<br/><br/>While in prison, Danny makes a few realizations that change his life forever. At first, he makes it known that he his a white supremacy affiliate by showing the courtyard his swastika tattoo. This gives Danny an inauguration into the ""white group"", which ensures him a bit more safety inside the walls. But when Danny realizes that all ethnicities work together to get what they want in prison, much like the normal world, he quickly turns a cold shoulder to the members of the group and attempts to fly solo for the rest of his sentence. This may have worked for him, with the occasional rape here and there, but against his will he befriends one of his fellow prisoners that he works with while doing laundry, and it just so happens that this man is black! <br/><br/>With a new outlook on life, Danny is released from prison only to find out that Derek has shaved his head, become part of Danny's neo-Nazi organization (which has grown and become much more official since Danny's prison sentence). It is now Danny's goal to try to take off the mask of hatred that Derek now wears much like Danny had to do himself.<br/><br/>American History X is powerful, touching, and shockingly inspirational. While parts of the movie show the darker and more twisted side of humanity, (much like the infamous curb stomp scene) I think these parts are extremely necessary and expose the racism and bigotry that lives in this country today. The darker parts only shed even more light on the positive, inspiring parts of this movie like the fact that this terrible, grotesque personality like Danny Vinyard can come all the way back from the depths of Hades and then try to save his brother from falling into the same pit. Edward Norton delivers a terrific performance and shows the world his open book of talents in this film. While Norton's performance is great, his seemed to be the only one that shined out of the rest. While there are some clips of talent here and there, these clips were short and sweet. Edward Furlong, who played Derek Vinyard, fell very short in my eyes. His performance seemed more like it belonged on Lifetime than it did on the big screen. One thing I noticed, that I feel compelled to mention, is the major abuse of the extreme close up shots. Whether it's faces, showers, or a basketball game, this movie seems to always fit an ECU frame in almost every scene to the point where it's extremely noticeable and quite imposing. The movie's plot and screenplay were great but it all felt very rushed. The flow from scene to scene was abrupt and I often found myself feeling disconnected to the characters, even Norton's, due to the lack of background story. Danny's motive as a neo-Nazi was a bit unclear. It's understood that his father was killed by African-Americans, and that before then his father is shown telling him a very racist lecture in a dinner conversation but other than that the viewer is really left to wonder why there is so much passion in hate within this man. All in all, American History X is well worth the watch especially if you have an interest in history, social, cultural or psychological issues."

","Well what can I say about this film.. Very powerful, The casting was superb as these roles are not easy to play when you (the actor) are galaxies away from their reality (the characters) Fantastic job from every actor who featured in this film, They really excelled themselves and it was a great watch. Ed was absolutely blinding. And so was everyone else. Its not easy playing a racist when you don't agree nor condone such behaviour. Credit has to go to the casting director/s too as with out their experience and trained eye for talent this could have gone seriously wrong! The writers, Well... Where do I begin on the writing. Within an inch of perfection. Perfect by a country mile! Every detail was on point. Really well done to everyone who made this piece of history.

"Mr-Fusion","6","1","2","21 October 2016"," Deeply flawed, but still resonant.
","""American History X"" deserves credit for having an absorbing story to support its penchant for controversy. In all honesty, I approached this movie ready and willing to hate it (hey, I'll admit bias here; when a movie's eye-widening appeal is a curb-stomp scene, what could it possibly have to offer on racism?), but I also remained involved til the very end. This is primarily because Edward Norton's performance is magnet; and even before his post-prison reformation , he still owns the screen, vile diatribes notwithstanding. He is this movie.<br/><br/>That said, it's far from perfect, and it's still reactionary to a great extent. That famous scene aside, there are a few pieces of viciousness strewn throughout. Some of it simply didn't work (that scene with the Nazi posters being pulled down from the wall feels very contrived, as well as Furlong's narration), and I can do without the choral singing on the score. The ending feels heap, but could've worked had they not gone overboard with the melodrama.<br/><br/>As long as you're not looking for subtlety, this is definitely worth a watch.<br/><br/>6/10"
"eagandersongil","9","1","2","15 October 2016"," The sides of the same story
","""American Hystory X"" has a message to us through, and for me, this message is passed by the best possible manner, the shock, seen here redemption of Derek, a neo-Nazi who has his ideology put to the test when it is forced to live with the differences, but do not expect here a cute little redemption movie with flowers and fragrant, to where one side is wrong and the other is good, no, here they all are at the mercy of anger at the opposite, not even understand why, Tony Kayne, director of very few movies, tries to show the danger of an ideology, a thought, is white Latinos and blacks hating without any justification or blacks who always have to behave like bandits, is a basquetes game or reckoning, the film criticizes, criticizes and beat up, he is extremely violent, but hardly has blood in it, because its violence is far beyond just the physical. In terms of technical aspects Kayne's great to show the Flashbacks of our protagonist in black and white, and highlight the timeline, he wants to make us remember World War II, meaning that all such discrimination is a thing of the past, and narrative off of Danny and the family unit is great, because if we saw the film without these two aspects we do not apegaríamos Derek, on the contrary, we'd hate, and hate is the opposite of what the film wants to preach, we we can not agree with Derek, but if we hate, we are not very different, the soundtrack is accurate, the picture is beautiful, especially in black and white times, the script is extremely intelligent, but leave some loose ends, and the performances are all great, especially Edward Norton, who is a great actor, but unlike the majority of his other films where he has a submissive and apathetic performance, not here, he is threatening, you really afraid, and yet he can pass the dramatic side, this is certainly one of the greatest performances of his career. Finally, the film is much more than a story of racism, the film deals with the human being, but outside the film's message, its technical aspects are amazing, it is a film that everyone should see."

","I honestly don't think I have ever seen a better movie than American History X in my entire life! I may only be 14, but I have seen a lot of movies. I am an avid fan of them, and this one just takes the cake. Edward Norton is just unbelievable. He is the most talented actor I've ever laid eyes on. His performance in the movie is phenomenal. He delves so deep into his character that he can convince the whole audience easily of his neo-nazi role. The look on his face as he walks back from killing one man in the first seen is purely horrifying. The entire move was dramatic, intriguing, and powerful. It really is moving and emotional as well as scary. It is so true to life, and provides the viewer with such insight into the life and events that create a monster such as Derek Vinyard. It answers many questions I have long awaited an answer to such as what could possibly make someone act as Derek did in this movie, yet left open-ended many others that people such as myself may have. Almost every single scene in the movie was extremely captivating. I can't even go on to say more about the acting, other than if Edward Norton does not win best actor this year, I will go absolutely nuts. It's bad enough he lost it to Cuba Gooding Jr. when he was in Primal Fear, which was yet another incredible performance by him. Edward Furlong, the little kid from T2 is astounding as the confused brother of Derek. I was stunned walking out of the theater after seeing American History X, and I don't think I will ever have the benefit of seeing another movie as good as this one as long as I live. I recommend anyone with a good tolerance for violent and graphic depictions go see this movie. I am bewildered as to why director Tony Kaye would ever want out of this success. If I were to rate this movie, as I often do for others in reviewing them for school, I would give it an A+ with all of my heart."

The summary of the film in my opinion is that parents they have to upbringing their children to a open-minded and friendly family environment. Parents' hazardous believes propagandize children minds and transform them from good little people to an ""atomical future youthful bomb"". Mainly parents are responsible for theirs children delinquent behaviors and actions and first of all we have to blame them for the tragic incidence and not the children.

","We often see movies on social issues, inequalities, crimes etc. Generally, the first rule crafted by most films is to pick a side. For whom should the support go to? Which side does the protagonist fight for? How well do they achieve ""equality"" in the end?<br/><br/>This is not most films. It's almost impossible to not take a stand while portraying a social issue. But that's where brilliance lies. This film taken a journalistic view on the subject. And it goes deep in it's research on why the protagonist picks his side in a visibly unequal society. We travel with the protagonist, what logic does he apply to his actions? Where did it all start for him? What took for his views to change?<br/><br/>And it isn't like a documentary.. it never gets boring. You walk into the lives of black gangs, white gangs, jews, mexicans.. each group with their own story to tell.<br/><br/>It's a film that requires an extraordinary performance for it to be subtle and convincing.

","This is by far, one of the greatest films I've ever seen which tackles the issues on racism, social inequalities and stereotypes. <br/><br/>The movie is basically about a neo-Nazi skinhead who is an extreme racist, and part of a supremacist group mainly because of influences from his father, and Cameron Alexander, who is a hate-writer and a racist on the same grounds as his father. <br/><br/>We don't get to see it much, but Cameron mainly serves as a father figure for Derek, which is why he does half the things he does throughout the course of the plot. How Derek finally realizes his mistakes, and reforms as a good and normal human being forms the crux of the plot. <br/><br/>The movie swings between black and white visuals, and color, the former which signifies the skinhead days and flashback of the Vinyard family which is told in both Derek and his brother's perspective, and the latter being the new and reformed Derek's story. <br/><br/>Edward Norton is the main show-stealer in this movie. After Primal Fear, and Fight Club, this is a 30 pound heavier Norton who plays a badass, and a normal human being throughout the course of the film. Tony Kaye's cinematography is brilliant, as is Anne Dudley's superb compositions which reverberate throughout the film's runtime. <br/><br/>I was surprised that only Edward got an Oscar nomination, which he did not win (another surprise). I also felt that Tony Kaye, the film and Anne Dudley's score should also have been recognized. <br/><br/>Other than a few niggles here and there, such as the actress who plays Norton's girlfriend in the movie's not so great performance, this movie is a treat to watch from the first minute. <br/><br/>A must-watch."

I love the way this movie was made, because it solely focused on showing what lead to Derek killing two people, not just showing how he and his neo-nazi crew demolishes stores and assaults black people.<br/><br/>Derek was a normal teenager, but it only took a few minutes worth of lecturing from his father to change his life. He took his father as a role model and became a neo-nazi fanatic, falling into his ignorance and leading others to the same. When Derek's father got killed, his rage towards other races escalated even more, making him angrier than ever. Danny looked up to his older brother and ended up trying to copy him. However, just for a brief moment before Danny got killed Derek managed to change Danny's opinion on life. Just shows how easy it is to influence a life of a person close to you and change for the better.<br/><br/>Derek realized, that it doesn't matter what is your skin colour, you can still get along, and freed himself from the ignorance he was living in. He stopped looking at stereotypes and judging everybody before getting to know them, some people really would need to wake up and realize this in order to make a better world.<br/><br/>Edward Norton showed everyone once again - he can play a variety of roles, he looked just awesome at the first half of the movie, when he was a neo-nazi fanatic, could not have imagined he that badass look to him.

The movie however turned out to be extremely powerful mainly due to the professionalism it was made with.<br/><br/>The movie its story is told 'beautifuly' in black & white and color. The quite original directing from Tony Kaye gives the movie a nice visual style and certain atmosphere. The story itself isn't that complicated or extremely original on its own and perhaps at most points even predictable but the way the story is told is phenomenal. This is not a movie with an happy ending or a movie that provides a solution to the racial discrimination problems. It shows what is NOT the solution to the problems and that everything that is occurring is like a vicious circle. The movie does not give a hopeful message but instead shows the dangers and pain you're causing to yourself and your close environment when you're thinking as a white supremacist.<br/><br/>As an anti Neo-Nazi movie this movie works really powerful. I think that its a really good and important thing that this movie is often shown in classrooms.<br/><br/>Edward Norton is truly fantastic in his role. He is very well believable as a Neo-Nazi as well as the reformed person he later turns into in the movie. It's almost like he's playing 2 different characters and he does that so extremely well. Also really good was Edward Furlong who we all long had not seen in a big production. Furlong and Norton are both acting well together in their scene's are highly believable as two brothers.<br/><br/>Also surprising good was the musical score by Anne Dudley who had already won an Oscar for ""The Full Monty"", the year before.<br/><br/>This was a movie that surprisingly impressed me. As a movie its extremely powerful and important."
"troyputland","9","1","2","16 July 2015"," Its performances make this a standout film.
","Utterly outstanding performances from the two Edwards (Norton and Furlong). American History X is a fine blend of drama and thriller, a story behind the leader of a neo-nazi cultist Derek Vinyard (Norton), seen from the eyes of his younger brother Danny (Furlong). AHX flicks from flashbacks of Derek's rise (head of a cult) and fall (murder), and rise again (redemption), to his present day atonement. Derek's crime is one of the most violent off-screen acts in cinema history. Danny looks up to his older brother, slowly but surely following his footsteps. It's down to Derek to put things right. This film sticks to the back of the mind, because the representation of its immoral actions are heavy, powerful and a harsh kick on reality regarding hate-crime."
"calminsanityy","10","1","2","18 July 2015"," A film that shows a life ruled by violence and racism until something tragic happens
","An excellent movie that shows the life of a Nazi who has to face prison after killing two black men. The title refers to an assignment Danny has to write after the school principle, who was a black man, is outraged by Danny's history paper about Nazism, so he gives him the task to write about skin-heads for a special class named 'American History X'. An impressive movie, from all the things Derek has to face in prison, to the way he tries to change Danny, his younger brother, showing him that the path he has chosen is not right. Edward Norton's acting is beyond perfect, this has to be one of his greatest roles, Edward Furlong played very well, this movie would not be the same without them. The story is well thought and the cast is chosen well. The ending has a great impact on everyone."

","Great drama/action flick! Edward Norton in his prime, from beginning to end you will drawn to this movie, Great all star cast, awesome directing as well. Deals with a lot of racial topics and subjects from both sides of the fence in a very entertaining manor, very hard hitting. I love this movie! Some of the scenes are very graphic with violent content. I really can not fault this movie. Probably my favourite movie with Edward Norton in it of all time and I would like to see him play some similar roles like this again because he is so good at it! Very capable of playing many different roles but this is definitely some of his best work apart from fight club! watch this movie now, and if you already have, watch it again, classic! In fact I might watch it again now! Any way, this has been my first movie review of many more to come I hope, thanks for reading, hope you enjoyed it, now enjoy the movie!"

","I can't believe I had never heard of this movie before I saw it. There is so much cr*p out there that people want to talk about as if it were important, but this film is so much more interesting and edifying. It seemed so real that it almost felt like a documentary. <br/><br/>Afterwards, you just want to discuss all the issues raised in it, from neo-Nazis to racism to the American school system to anti-Semitism to the prison system. Be sure to watch with intellectually awake friends to discuss those issues and your new insights with them. <br/><br/>But be ready for violence and cussing. Seeing that makes you wonder how anyone from such a home could possibly leave his or her family as a psychologically and emotionally intact human being. The fact that such excellent actors as Edward Norton, Stacey Keach, and Beverly d'Angelo played in this movie shows you how important it was to them to make a stand."

","""American History X"" is a poignant story of family, redemption and retribution. It revolves around the life of Derek Vinyard, a Neo- Nazi who, after doing three years of prison and self-reflection, changes his ways, and when he is released from prison, tries to do the same for his younger brother; Danny Vinyard. <br/><br/>Edward Norton does a fantastic job of portraying Derek, both before and after his transformation from his skinhead lifestyle. Norton accurately displays the opinions and thoughts of his character, without making him come across as your typical neo-nazi; Derek is an angry and frustrated man who blames blacks for his father's murder - yet he is intelligent and has his own opinions and thoughts regarding modern society; he is not narrow-minded, despite his strongly racist mindset. After his trasformation, Norton still plays Derek in a practically flaw- less manner, portraying him as the older brother filled with regret and remorse, but also someone who has not let this get the better of him. He portrays him as someone who now has responsibilities in his life, and also someone who is determined to turn both his and Danny's life ar- ound.<br/><br/>Edward Norton is not the only actor in this film who does an outstanding job of portraying their character. Edward Furlong plays Danny, Derek's younger, confused brother. Furlong plays this character almost immaculately; he accurately portrays the frustration and rebellious nature that resides in this character. Danny was, for me, the most interesting character in the film; although I have no doubt others will disagree entirely. However, Danny is a high school student who has spent his whole life looking up to his brother Derek, idolizing him throughout his childhood and young adulthood, meaning that Dereks actions have reflected heavily onto his younger brother. In one scene, Derek has a dispute with his family about Derek's views. Danny rarely speaks in this act, but when he does, he is defending his brohter. <br/><br/>The film is visually powerful. When the film is going through a flashback, the screen is changed to black and white, which helps to add to the overall dark tone of the film. <br/><br/>One of the most notable aspects of the film are the prison scenes; During his jail time, Derek's only real friends turn out to be those who he thought he hated the most; the blacks. Derek befriends a black man named Lamont (played by Guy Torry) , who is essentially the biggest reason for Derek's transformation; He teaches Derek that, basically, not all black people are bad. When they first meet, Lamont knows that Derek is a skinhead; he knows that Derek most probably resents him just because of his skin colour. Despite this, Lamont still shows respect for Derek, showing him the ropes and being his only real friend in the prison. Derek's other black associate is a man named Sweeney, who is Danny's high school teacher. During the course of the film, Sweeney and Derek become closer friends, mainly through Danny. But here is the most important part: when Derek is assaulted in jail, Sweeney is literally the only one who is there for him. Lamont and Sweeney are possibly the two most important characters in the entire story; they prove to Derek that even whites can be bad, and that even blacks can be good. Without these two characters, when Derek left jail he probably would've just gone straight back to his old ways.<br/><br/>In conclusion, ""American History X"" is a film that is not afraid to deal with common issues in American society head on. The film does not hold back, and hits the audience with cold, hard truth combined with it's gritty realism that leaves viewers in magnificent awe. AHX has one message, and it delivers it beautfully; and it is that if you follow the path of hatred, sooner or later you will pay the price."
"sandnair87","10","1","2","27 April 2015"," American History X is A Harrowing Morality Tale!
","Make no mistake; American History X is not pretty. It's not fun. It made me squirm and cringe. Not because it was bad, but because it's powerful stuff - a refreshing change from the usual saccharine attempts by Hollywood to address racism, giving us a brilliant tale told without restraint or bias.<br/><br/>The movie begins on the day former leader of a neo-Nazi skinhead gang Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) gets out of prison after serving a 3- year sentence for the vicious manslaughter of black thieves who were trying to steal his truck. The incident in question was the culmination of Derek's indoctrination as a white supremacist, begun in the lessons of his father who was slain at the hands of black men, and picked up by Venice Beach's white-power kingpin Cameron. Derek's high-flying stardom within the latter's organization crashes in prison, where Derek slowly learns the error of his ways and builds a resolve to keep his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) from following in his footsteps. He comes home to find that his brother has succumbed to the rancorous influence of the same hate- group who turned him into a skinhead thug.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, at school, Danny must rewrite a paper for his history class because the glowing essay he wrote on Mein Kampf - at Cameron's urging - was rejected. He is ordered by his high school principal Dr. Sweeney to instead write a report on his brother and his own journey into the twisted skinhead world titled 'American History X'. Derek is the star of Danny's account, and Derek's transformation is revealed in black and white flashbacks when he recounts to Danny about his prison ordeal - his disillusionment with other skinhead inmates, their revenge on him and his unexpected friendship with a black convict. Danny slowly comes to realize the truth - the venom spewed by Cameron and his ilk creates nothing but misery. In the end, though, there is no escaping the price for Derek's sins. <br/><br/>American History X is deceptively simple in its story telling, but first-time director Tony Kaye directs it like an auteur, giving us a harrowing morality tale that is both rich and gripping at all times. But it is Edward Norton's riveting performance as a smart kid seduced by horrible ideas that makes the story real. He plays the raging neo-Nazi with unsettling conviction, spitting hateful propaganda and brutally letting his feelings out. Edward Furlong's performance as Danny shows an impressive range for a young actor, making Danny a believable teenager.<br/><br/>When Edward Norton's brilliant, fully rounded performance rubs up against the film's grainy toughness - complimented by an impressive, gut-wrenching screenplay - American History X becomes an exhilarating experience."
"ericrnolan","9","1","2","29 September 2014"," I'm glad I watched ""American History X"" (1998).
","It's a good, smart, enjoyable film. I learned from it.<br/><br/>I'd really rather not discuss its social or political messages. One glance at an online discussion of this movie shows that they're divisive and often ugly. (There are even ongoing debates about which gangs or groups should rightly be called ""Skinheads,"" and which are racist.) I'm just not in the mood for controversy this morning. I'd rather just tell you what I thought about AHX as a film.<br/><br/>This movie had a lot of great things going for it, but two things stood out in particular. The first was Edward Norton's tour de force performance. I've liked Norton elsewhere, like ""Red Dragon,"" where he was good. Here, he's phenomenal. He's goddam frightening as Neo-nazi Derek. (He reminded me of Bill Moseley's turn as ""Otis Driftwood"" in ""House of 1,000 Corpses."") Then we see him as a redeemed man. Then, through flashbacks, he's made even more human and three-dimensional, as we see a sensitive young teenager traumatized by the death of his father. Norton was so damned good that I still seem to have trouble believing that the same actor played all three roles. I don't pretend to be a film expert; reviews like this are just a hobby. But I think I know great acting when I see it, and this was great acting.<br/><br/>The second was a really smart script. Again, I learned from this. I always assumed that Neo-Nazis were poorly educated nuts from the fringes of society. As it turns out, they actually do have an ideology, albeit a horrible and misguided one. This movie makes a very smart move in scripting Derek and his younger brother as ""brilliant"" students, who articulate facts and motivations for doing odious things. Listening to Derek's tirades (including one cringe- inducing scene at a dinner-table) actually sheds light on what motivates the characters' real-life counterparts.<br/><br/>Only two small things occurred to me that made this film a little less perfect than so many others have claimed it to be. First, this movie doesn't even know the meaning of subtlety. Its message and delivery were so heavy handed that it was almost an ABC afterschool special. We even have an overly convenient framing device – Derek's adulating brother, Danny (played wonderfully by Edward Furlong), is asked by an African American history teacher to write a report on Derek's life. The superior film, ""Crash"" (2004,) for example, handled racism with a hell of a lot more finesse and surprises.<br/><br/>Second, one character arc was way too quick and implausible. After one conversation with his redeemed older brother, Danny also disavows the Neo-nazi movement? After years of propaganda and socialization by the group? I'm not so sure a disturbed, fascist teenager can be deprogrammed so easily. Did anyone else who saw this movie wonder about this as well?<br/><br/>Still, this was a great film. I'd give it a 9 out of 10. One final note – the ending quote by Abraham Lincoln was just beautiful. I'd actually heard only snippets of it sampled by films before – once in ""Apocalypse Now"" and once in ""X2: X-Men United."" It's better in its entirety."
"Sleepflower87","10","1","2","11 August 2014"," Directing and acting brilliance - hard hitting.
","I have watched this film so many times over the years and I just cannot fault it. Beautiful and tragic. Such a hard subject to deal with in cinema yet so wonderfully portrayed.<br/><br/>Edward Norton and Edward Furlong are the perfect acting duo for this role, you wouldn't expect Norton to fit so naturally into it, but he does, and nobody could have done a better job.<br/><br/>This film has so much; tension, disgust, anger, love, comradery, hope, despair, tragedy.... <br/><br/>This kind of subject will never be portrayed better in a film, and is an all time classic and a must see for anyone into films."
"Lauren-Fraser13","10","1","2","11 May 2014"," Brilliant!
","American History X is in my top five all time mind blowing films. The performance alone from Edward Norton was phenomenal, the guy takes you on an emotional roller-coaster like you would not believe until you have seen it for yourself. There are good actors who will portray a character well enough for the audience to understand a role but to make the viewers really get the uncensored underlying emotions and thoughts of the character is a talent to be well respected. This film was able to make me feel disgusted with society and be completely disappointed in humanity, yet it gave me hope all in one fell swoop. Understanding a neo-nazism skinheads lifestyle is not an easy task and this film certainly doesn't make it any easier but it is worth a watch if you can stomach the hard hitting punches of racism and violence."

The USA is too big and diversified for all of the different cultures to live in peace and harmony. All those shooting sprees and all those problems. There will be always some tensions between different nations and cultures living there. But there are tensions in other multinational countries as well. Nothing new.<br/><br/>Acting is excellent, plot is very interesting and describes these problems so well. I am so glad Captain Sisko came along to lend a hand.

","I don't know what I expected when I stuck this in the DVD player this evening. I didn't know much about the film, only that it was related to racism. I found the brainwashing of Derek and Danny completely shocking, and the scene with the pavement chilled me to the bone, especially the look on Derek's face after the deed was done. <br/><br/>Something I am not quite sure of is why Danny, having seen something so awful, would decide to go down the same route as his brother. I guess it was the only route he could see, but it just didn't quite stack up.<br/><br/>Probably more shocking was Derek's turnaround in prison. I didn't expect that really. The shower scene was just so awful, but I am still surprised that he changed his views after being such a hard line racist previously. <br/><br/>Think I expected the white supremacists to go after Derek's family, so the ending was a surprise. An unexpectedly powerful film, lots of shocks, great acting, lived the black and white filming for the past, ed Norton was superb, and refreshingly unpredictable."
"michaelakruber","9","1","2","17 December 2013"," One of my Favourites
","This film has to be one of my favourites, it really made me agree and understand both concepts the movie was trying to get across, at the beginning of the movie it made me understand why Neo-Nazi's exist today. Though by the end it showed a different side and left me more open minded than I was before I watched the film. The movie is based around race and racism and the divide between the two. The film had a shocking ending and changed my whole perspective on the topic. It left me in between which concludes me agreeing with the message it gives across that we shouldn't live our life angry and dependant on a belief because each side is valid and has an opinion just a much as the other. A must watch film if your open-minded and opinionated on topics that are unresolved and possibly never will be."
"mattperkinson78","9","1","2","15 December 2013"," Excellent
","Although the core of the movie is gritty and a very harsh subject to touch on, all actors and director pulled it off. Full of raw emotion that will have you questioning your perception of what racism has actually done to this society. Stacey Keach makes you hate him. Edward Norton makes you hate him, then root for him, and then sympathize with his character. Edward Furlong pulls off a great performance as well as a young man trying to find what his beliefs actually are. Surprise under the radar movie that just brought so much emotion to the screen. Sadly I hardly ever hear this movie brought up in many conversations as an excellent movie, but it should be."

","I found this film truly excellent. One of the best I've seen in a while and I only watched it in 2013 – 15 years after its release.<br/><br/>Edward Norton was truly superb and convincing as both a hard neo-nazi and a recovering criminal.<br/><br/>The storyline – perhaps still as relevant as ever – was detailed, heart-warming but at the same time sad and very compelling.<br/><br/>I'm not a fan of Edward Furlong and as usual didn't enjoy his performance, but it made no different as he was totally overshadowed by Norton.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend this film. I was glued to it from start to finish."

","The fact that i haven't watched this movie before is painful. But thanks to my brother, i finally had the chance to watch it.<br/><br/>One afternoon after school i lied down in front of the TV and watched it. I've watched the movie without any idea of the subject. The title of it had put up a ''Indian vs White Men'' kind of a thing in my mind. But it was much more different. I just hope that the simple minded humans won't see the reason of Edward Norton's character's change in the movie as rape. That laundry has changed him. Between all those white sheets there was a black sheet, and the blinding light of the white sheets has caused him to see peace in the black sheet. In the movie, it is perfectly represented that human mind is something else than just a follower of a path. My brother has a saying: ''Never hate the change, for the change is the very reason men was created.'' A man who can change is greater than the others.<br/><br/>And man, what an ending! I never knew that i was such an emotional person. When i looked at the mirror after the credits, i had no difference than a tomato.<br/><br/>Such a powerful movie. This movie has taught me hatred. It taught me passion. It taught me that the very things i defend might be wrong. It taught me not to be afraid of change. And most importantly, it showed me how life works."
"winstonwardell","10","1","2","9 October 2013"," this film is all Reich with me.
","without a doubt this film is the most emotionally moving film I've ever seen. The fact that Edward Norton did not win the Oscar for best actor only validates the bias nature of the Oscars and it loses credibility.Edward Norton shows a man with very strong opinions and how they are manipulated and form into this dark evil monster that he has to battle alone. Derek is character who does something very difficult even a morally sane person would struggle with, not just doubt his beliefs but confront them face on. we see this pure evil manifest into something even worse and yet he is able to gain perspective in jail. now this film hardly paints jail as a nice, lovely place were people go to find there moral compass but rather tries to show it as I suspect it really is; a crossroads for people to either gain perspective or continue to be blinded by there own ignorance. The black and white flashbacks symbolic of a world were Derek separated blacks and whites, beautifully depicts the internal conflicts he faced on a day to day basis only to show once he sees the light (represented by the return of colour) he is a different person still facing the same problems but his approach is different this is paramount and the anchor of the storyline. every character faces a crossroad but its only till perspective is gained will they emerge from this haze of ignorance and stupidity. this film is so down to earth it plummets to the core of the world it is illustrating and faces the monster that has left a trail of destruction, negatively influenced loved ones and physically harmed others, it does not wrap a pretty ribbon around it just makes you feel something and much like the characters in the film, leaves the audience with perspective and how racism manifests and who it affects."
"carmelita-castrellon","10","1","2","22 September 2013"," Mind blowing
","This is the best movie of the 90's and even to date. The script is amazing. The acting is mind blowing and the cinematography is outstanding. It teaches us all a lesson about life. Thats its not always good and OK. Some people rather live in pride and blind. Its a story telling us the past ways are not always good. For most people they have to learn the hard way to figure out that you must learn from peoples mistakes and not always fallow other people in their foot steps but your own. For example like Derek, by his ways he was taught to be a nazi. So he killed a African American and went to prison. He learned later on that being white doesn't make you have power in a place like prison. He got taught a lesson and changed his ways. When he got out he had a different mind set and tried to get his brother Danny out of the bad road that he was once down."

","Watching movies has evolved into a passion of mine since I just regularly watched them for entertainment. In the past, I would simply turn the television on, pop a CD and watch for about two hours. This no longer happens.<br/><br/>American History X is a truly wonderful film. It offers thought provoking discussions, an emotional plot and a story we can all learn lessons from. Over the years, watching movies as a hobby has transformed into a learning experience--one where the viewer is a student who witnesses the events transpiring. As the students, you start to see American History X is more than a single class where insolent children have catharsis; it's a place of growth where boys become men. <br/><br/>People argue that you never really value something until you feel pain like the characters in this movie. The relationship issues, pursuit for happiness, thoughts of loneliness and anger that builds up inside are emotions we all feel. Maybe we never actually do realize the importance of others and the values we hold until a traumatic event occurs, but this movie certainly comes close."
"riccastro12","9","1","2","1 March 2013"," A character extremely well constructed and a powerful and much need message against Neo-Nazism compensate for some of the story minor flaws
","This movie has a good story, worth being told, well structured, believable. But the story is not what makes this a great movie.<br/><br/>What won the movie for me was Edward Norton's character Derek Vinyard. This movie could very easily made the mistake of showing him not as a character, but as a personification of mindless rage and hate, and even though the movie sometimes go out of his way to make it clear that his beliefs and attitudes are ultimately wrong (something very justifiable given the sensitive subject), they show us where all of this come from. They us what happened to a brilliant young man that made him into a monster, giving the character depth and making us feel the tragedy of his downfall into a skinhead.<br/><br/>The movie in a somewhat subtle way shows us that, despite the facts of his life influencing in his choice, the responsibility for his mistakes is his alone. This is made by his sister's character, who in spite of living in the same environment turned out to be a decent human being. This contrast of a character who is brutal, ruthless, and destructive to everyone around him but is not simply a diabolic Disney villain makes this a good movie.<br/><br/>Said that, the others characters work well, with highlights to Edward Furlong who plays very well Norton's brother.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the movie works well with the violence, making the audiences cringe with it, feel the suffering of the victims and leaving no doubt that the skinheads crosses completely any moral standart and should in no way be praised or idolized. Making the violence feel this real is somewhat difficult in an age where we are so used to it that if a movie kills less than half a planet we barely even notice.<br/><br/>The movie is not however perfect. Norton's time in prison takes a little from the movie's plausibility, since he would need to have the shortest of sights not to realize that his open confrontation of the other neo-Nazis would lead to his raping and almost to his death, and maybe his brother reform was a little rushed.<br/><br/>Where the story fails, the character construction and the powerful message as well as it magnificent use of visual resources redempts it. All in all, a must see. 8,5/10"

","American History X is one of the most powerful movies released in years. Not since Schindler's List has the subject of racism been so potently presented. The use of black and white cinematography to portray painful flashbacks is amazing, and the settings, while not necessarily pretty, fit the story flawlessly Edward Norton is truly fantastic in his role. He is very well believable as a Neo-Nazi as well as the reformed person he later turns into in the movie. It's almost like he's playing 2 different characters and he does that so extremely well. Also really good was Edward Furlong who we all long had not seen in a big production. Furlong and Norton are both acting well together in their scene's are highly believable as two brothers.<br/><br/>Although the film contains a constant strong theme of violence, it is always justified in portraying a picture of racial tension. Neither black nor white people are ""judged"" in the film, it's primary focus being to outline that it's people's brutality that causes a racial divide, not race itself."

Nothing about this film disappointed me or that I thought was stupid about it. Every element was stunning and amazing. All I can say is, i'm simply speechless.<br/><br/>Finally, a film that doesn't follow the typical ""don't be racist"" message. Yes, it has that, but in a completely different way and tone. It's brought out different as well.<br/><br/>Story: Edward Norton is a Neo-Nazi civil leader who's anger and mean spirit towards immigrants leads him to murder two African Americans, sentencing him to 3 years in prison. Out in the open 3 years later, a changed Edward decides to change his life, starting by preventing his younger brother, (Edward Furlong) from going down the same path he has.<br/><br/>The film is mostly told in a flashback perspective, introducing what causes Edward to visit prison, what inspired his anger, and how prison changes him.<br/><br/>Edward Norton's performance is the god of all performances. Not only should he have won the Oscar for best actor, but it shouldn't be the least bit close to any of the others. Unbelievably convincing and inspiring, and flawlessly carries out his role. His performance made this movie. It completely resembled everything this movie stood for. No words can describe how much his performance inspired me. I'm confused on how it's even possible that a performance could be as good as this. He nailed this performance from beginning to end.<br/><br/>Edward Furlong excellently transforms from a little trouble making punk to a changed, and well understood boy who learns to appreciate other races.<br/><br/>I'm not going to say a thing about the ending. All i'm going to say is that it is a gigantic slap in the face. Regardless, it gets the message around very clear, and manages to stay professional. Although not the ending you may expect, it is still a very nice and perfect conclusion to the film.<br/><br/>This is just the brink of what I can say about this film. The performances, the story, and the all around film was just nailed perfectly. The film, from beginning to end, knows what it's doing, and does it...brilliantly. This film is a must to see. See it, because this film impacted my life greatly, and made me look very differently on life. I'm so glad I saw this film. I don't know if i'd see it again, because something as beautifully done as this doesn't come around very often, and I would not want to make it tiring, ever. Maybe one other time years later. All I can simply say is that this film left me speechless, but my mind filled. I thank this movie, and all responsible for it's creation."
"Pierre_D","7","1","2","11 June 2012"," Uneven film with a strong message on racism.
","American History X is a star-studded film whose message about racism hits you at a visceral level, but ultimately seems like an after school television special with its characterizations.<br/><br/>We're in California a few years after the Rodney King riots and incidents. Ed Norton is Derek Vinyard, a tough-talking skinhead and his brother Danny is getting drowned in the maelstrom of hate. Derek's room has posters of Hitler and other white supremacist tokens and he has a swastika tattooed across his back; he's crossed that line and there is no coming back, or so we think...<br/><br/>Sadly uneven, American History X could have been much more. Blacks in the picture are shown as either neutral (playing basketball and hanging out) or criminal or almost subservient. It isn't until Derek is in jail that we say an African American with depth and by that time we would really have liked another one with depth. The prison scenes are some of the best in the movie, with Derek being violated after he didn't pay for protection and his isolation from the other white supremacists finally does him in.<br/><br/>Derek finds redemption in prison and tries to save Danny from the jaws of fellow skinheads but it all unravels for the family when he breaks up with his girlfriend, tells off Stacy Keach (the skinhead leader) and pulls Danny out, not a minute too soon. Seeing them tear down their propaganda and turn over a new leaf is as uplifting as Danny's murder at the end is disheartening. In the end, American History X teaches us that violence begets violence and that while you can change yourself you may never be able to change your environment.<br/><br/>Sadly, the movie could used another half hour or so to show the other side of the coin, a side that was never explored until the prison scenes."
"singerbird","10","1","2","21 January 2012"," A Beautiful and Important film
","I watched 'American History X' at a time in my life when I was thinking deeply about all the facets of racism and how it arises from the environments we are born into. I'm happy to say his film not only confirmed my own thoughts on these subjects but gave me even more insight into this worldwide problem. Being a white female who is probably still quite naive about racism because none of it ever comes my way, I am glad about the things I learned from this film. I find it interesting (and depressing) how so many movies and TV shows out there seem to glorify this idea of 'retribution' or vigilantism; the idea that one is not only righteous in murdering someone who has wronged them/harmed their family, but they gain respect from their peers (or those viewing the film)for doing so. Until I watched American History X I was yet to find a film that glorified forgiveness and change. For most of my life, I myself did not understand the concept of forgiveness, and unquestioningly believed in things like capital punishment, like many others around me (thankfully, I don't anymore!) What I love and relate to in this film is that it illustrates that every person, even those furtherest into their own beliefs, can change, and should be given the chance to do so. Some may say that the ending is cliché, but honestly I think when it comes to films with a message like this one, such observations are irrelevant and mundane. The ending was vital to the overall point of the film because it serves as a warning. At the risk of sounding cliché myself, the end of this film warns us not to carry on the cycle of violence, but to forgive, and let people change. It's called evolution :)"
"Desertman84","10","1","2","14 January 2012"," Provocative Film On Racism
","Tony Kaye made his feature directorial debut with this dramatic exploration into the roots of race hatred in America in this film entitled American History X.It tells the story of two brothers, Derek Vinyard and Daniel ""Danny"" Vinyard of Venice Beach in Los Angeles, California. Both are intelligent and charismatic students. Their father, a firefighter, is murdered by a black drug dealer while trying to extinguish a fire in a South Central neighborhood of Los Angeles, and Derek is drawn into the neo-Nazi movement. Derek brutally kills two black gang members whom he catches in the act of breaking into the truck left to him by his father, and is sentenced to three years in prison for voluntary manslaughter. The story shows how Danny is influenced by his older brother's actions and ideology and how Derek, now radically changed by his experience in incarceration, which includes violent rape by white inmates, tries to prevent his brother from going down the same path as he did. The film is told in the style of nonlinear narrative. David McKenna scripted the film and shooting took place in Los Angeles, California.<br/><br/>A well-made, well-acted and often violent film that offers a compelling portrait of redemption and the destructive nature of racism.It is a violent film on a weighty topic.It is brutally honest with its characters, actions, and ideas compelling the viewer to look further and become involved.This jolting film will draw serious-minded upscale viewers interested in cutting-edge fare and the latest outstanding performance by Edward Norton,an amazing actor and a hot-dog whose delight in transformation is infectious.This is a must-see not only for Norton's performance but on how it is interesting and sometimes compelling that it contains more actual provocative thought than any American film on race."

In the end, the movie is too simplistic to be a social masterpiece and too ambitious to be a good action movie. Norton, well, we saw him in better conditions than this piece of lost time. The only interesting part is the direction. But again difficult to be totally satisfied. Too many slow parts. The b&w / color idea is so blatant.

"Kubris","10","1","2","26 June 2011"," One of the best films I've ever seen.
","IMDb Top 250: 38<br/><br/>AHX is, in my young eyes, one of the best films ever created. A dark story, brilliantly acted, shown in all its brutality and vulgarity. A film that speaks to everyone: hate is baggage, and change is possible. And AHX has a great story to express that message with. It is truly a modern classic.<br/><br/>The most in-your-face part of American History is Derek, played by Edward Norton. Like De Niro in Taxi Driver, he is iconic, or will be in the future. Norton performs incredibly, showing the cruelty and violence of a Neo Nazi, as well as the hurt and sincerity of a changed man. How he didn't win the Oscar with that shaved head and tattoo is beyond me. It's worth seeing the film for him alone...<br/><br/>But almost all the other actors are as great, but don't have the part of Derek Vinyard. Furlong, as Danny, is great as the young, developing Derek, who smokes, writes papers on Mein Kampf, but still sticks up for the white kid who gets beat up and has time to give his sister 'airplane rides'. The rest of the family is well played, you can relate to them, and you can feel for them.<br/><br/>Only Seth and Derek's girlfriend are hard to watch. Seth is intentional though: he's an urban redneck, blind in his faith. The girlfriend is out of place. How a one-dimensional, trashy girl like that could end up with the ruthless (yet importantly smart) Derek is a little far fetched.<br/><br/>The music is quiet, yet important. It has a very American feel to it, and wouldn't be out of place in Saving Private Ryan. During the opening credits, it gives the viewer a feel for what's to come: an emotionally charged film set in their backyard.<br/><br/>And it is emotional. The use of black and white in flashbacks is perfect, and slow-mo in important scenes really adds to their emotional punch. You will feel emotions watching this: not sadness, but that might happen, but shame. That snide joke you made to your buddies behind that person's back, that prejudice you thought in your head, well American History X will remind you of that. <br/><br/>The plot is well crafted and well told, the flashbacks are placed perfectly, and the pacing keeps things constantly interesting. If you can stomach the infamous scenes and the ample, but necessary language, American History X might just change you as a person for the better. 9.8/10"

","The 1998 film American History X is about a family that is torn apart by the roots of race hatred within America. This story focuses on Danny Vinyard (Edward Fulong) who is in a white supremacist group which his brother Derek (Edward Norton) had once led. In the movie, Danny had written an English paper on Mein Kampf and now has to redo the paper and write about Derek. He has to analyze and interpret the events that had surrounded Derek's incarceration and how it had impacted his view on life and his family. Through Danny's writing the audience learns that Derek was the leader of the group and had committed crimes of a racial nature throughout Los Angeles. Now, Derek had just finished serving a three year jail sentence for manslaughter, for when he shot, killed, and curb stomped some African American youths for stealing his father's truck. Throughout the story, as Danny writes his paper, he reflects on all the events that had led up to Derek's arrest. Such as the trashing of Archie's Ranch Market, the violence at dinner, and the treatment of his family. However, what Danny does not understand is that during Derek's time in prison he had made friends with an African American named Lamont (Guy Torry), and had acquired a new outlook on life. Danny does eventually learn of Derek's new found look on life and in turn he too decides to leave the cult behind in search for something better not only for him but for his family.<br/><br/>This movie had been brilliantly presented by the director Tony Kaye. Through the black and white flashbacks accessible throughout the story, the audience really gets to focus in on what is happening during the scenes, and are able to achieve a deeper sense of depth to the story. The lighting and angles used also had improved the visual perspective, which coupled with the use of the development of the characters to convey the message had greatly enhanced the movie as a whole. In the end, what the viewers are to take away from this movie is the fact that even though the story did not preach about it directly, it is about racism and the hatred that is created from it. The movie is closely related to another movie called In the Heat of the Night which also carries the themes of racism and murder. People should not allow the hatred to consume their lives and essentially destroy not only themselves but also their family. Life is short, so why waste it on an emotion like hatred."
"tellsri_krishna-1","9","1","2","13 December 2008"," A brutal Edward Norton makes you sit up through this American history
","It is a powerhouse performance by Edward Norton that drives this compelling drama to a whole new height. Mr. Norton plays “Derek” a Nazi skinhead ex-convict who tries to prevent his younger brother “Danny”, played astutely by Edward Furlong, from going down the same path. <br/><br/>The movie is narrated by both these protagonists as plots and sub-plots get unfolded smoothly. The plot is relatively simple but it’s the natural ease with which all actors play their parts that ignites the story. Mr.Norton is absolutely convincing as the angry young man, furious at his social system and in the process gets caught up in his own ideologies.Scowling and scoffing at anyone who is non-white, Mr. Norton delivers a performance worthy of his Oscar nomination; a perfect foil to the timid “Narrator” of Fight club. The scene in which he grins at his brother as he gets arrested and then the shocking realization as he is dragged away from his family is a gem.<br/><br/>The other actors including Edward Furlong have played their parts extremely well. The characters have been sketched extremely well and reflect the contemporary American society. Edward Furlong as “Danny” who worships his brother reminds a little of the spoiled child in T2-Judgement Day. Derek’s mom, the mentor “Mr.Sweeny” and even Mr. Norton’s friend in prison, all are memorable characters that do stick in your mind. <br/><br/>The film does have flaws. I found the movie a little short for its social undertone, but that’s acceptable since the director did not want to delve too much into Derek’s past. But his transition from the brutal skinhead to the redeemed prisoner is not as developed as one might expect. This is where the movie could have gained more intensity. It is not really clear why Mr. Norton lands in trouble. As a result, this sequence alone comes out half baked; a very crucial under-development to the storyline. Typical of its genre, the redeemed man is not let off the hook that easily. We know life is going to come hard on Mr. Norton. The shattering climax was expected but not surrealistic. ""History X"" suffers from falling into stereotypes so characteristic of it's genre. Nevertheless, it is a hard hitting movie on racism and depicts the underlying tensions in an American neighborhood with absolute sincerity. However it’s the charismatic Mr. Norton who elevates this 'just another tale of redemption' into a cinematic masterpiece. The bottom line;racism is a cancer. You try hard to wipe it out; it reappears in some other way more lethal than ever before. Watch American History X for its greatness in its social message; Watch it for “Derek”. As a cinema goer you will be enthralled; as a human being you will be concerned."

","A high school student idolizes his neo-Nazi older brother who is released from prison after serving a sentence for killing two black men.

Furlong gives a finely understated performance as his quiet younger brother. In fact, the entire cast does a good job, including D'Angelo as Norton's mother and Gould as a Jewish teacher subjected to Norton's venomous rage. A remarkable film debut for director Kaye, although his at-times overly flashy camera-work and use of extreme closeups for no apparent reason is distracting."
"shortyrags","7","1","2","22 July 2008"," Haunting albeit Unrealistic
","Tony Kaye offers a dramatic film in the form of American History X, on the topic of racism, presented through the marginalized perspectives of Neo-Nazi nationalists. The story centers upon a bright, intelligent man Derek Vinyard, played by Edward Norton, who unyieldingly displays his hate and disgust for other races. He and his group of friends repeatedly make life difficult for other races living in the area. Their actions finally climax when Derek goes too far and has to serve time in prison, leaving his younger brother, Danny Vinyard, played by Edward Furlong, to the will of the Neo-Nazi group. The story is powerful and features ups and downs in the characters that add an air of humanity to these otherwise inhumane Neo-Nazi racists. The characters, for the most part, are grotesque and in certain cases, utmost embodiments of our own insecurities towards different cultures and lifestyles, initiating inner turmoil sometimes. The film sometimes plays off these fears a little too much and does not offer them in a more objective and subtle way.<br/><br/>The film takes place in a surreal setting where there is constant conflict between differing races. The focus here is on tensions between the Neo-Nazis and African-Americans living in the same neighborhood, and at times the film tends to become a little one-sided. It feels like some of the targets of Derek's horrific actions are simply victims, when in the grand scheme of things, they likely harbor similar feelings towards Derek's group and commit similar actions in retribution. Moreover, Derek's transformation in prison is brushed over rather quickly and uses one or two powerful scenes to imply a lifetime of change. It doesn't really work honestly and the film loses a lot of its credibility there.<br/><br/>The acting here is decent with Edward Norton standing head and shoulders above the rest of the cast. Danny Vinyard, despite arguably being the main character, seems like he's missing in certain scenes when Norton simply takes over. Edward Furlong does look the part but he doesn't act the part extremely well. Having said that, he does a decent enough job to propel the film forward, even with his annoying monologues that lack any spirit. The rest of the cast does well with what its given with Ethan Suplee playing Derek's leach-like and terrifying friend. Even William Russ makes a strong guest appearance in a flashback sequence that explains many of the present scenarios.<br/><br/>The visual style is interesting here with color scenes meant to represent Derek's changed lifestyle in the present, and stark black-and-white shots used in flashback sequences to juxtapose the two races against one another. The idea, while pretty good on paper, ends up coming on a little too strong in the film, and does end up hurting the film, even though it tries to add depth. There are several haunting scenes here that the camera crew has taken from the script and captured well in film. The score is mostly two-sided, using dark and low notes for the past, and higher pitched notes to indicate a possible, brighter future. It works pretty well but like the difference in color and black-and-white, it sometimes goes for too much, especially towards the end of the film.<br/><br/>American History X is a film about racism that is meant to inspire disgust for those portrayed on screen but also perhaps in ourselves when we sometimes shelter similar feelings. The film is literally a little too black and white, offering little gray space between, on the topic of racism. Unfortunately, certain things aren't always as simple as the film makes them out to be and Derek's transformation is both too unrealistic and short. Edward Norton does an incredible job here but the rest of the cast members, with a few exceptions, suffer greatly, and consequently, so does the film. Overall, the film sends out a powerful message, using powerful camera shots and characters to deliver it to the audience. It is grisly and gritty at times, giving us an extreme and bitter taste of Neo-Nazi racism. However, the film has too many flaws in its execution for it to be considered a classic of 90's cinema."
"amblin53","10","1","2","9 December 2007"," Different Meaning
","I've read many of the comments for American History and have understood people's opinions for this movie. But I am not sure if they understood the whole meaning of the movie.<br/><br/>The movie is narrated by Danny Vinyard, a teenager who's brother Derek is head of a white supremacy group. During the movie you find out why everything for the Vinyard family goes downhill because of a tragedy that happens. But, what I think people are missing is what Danny goes through. <br/><br/>Danny and Derek are kind of like teenager figures who are lost in today's over abundant society. Danny is trying to get his brother's appreciation because Derek is kind of a father figure, since their father's death. So when Derek started becoming a white supremacist Danny became one too. Lost in anger, Derek becomes very serious about gathering frustrated white kids to help him get back at others. Not to sure of himself Danny goes with the flow. Later on, Derek is released from prison as a new person, after he was sentenced for three years for killing two gangsters that were trying to steal his car. When Derek notices that Danny wants to be a criminal like how he was, he tries to convince Danny that all of the criminal acts Derek did were bull. Danny and Derek both have their own struggles.<br/><br/>The reason why I say Danny and Derek are teenager figures is because during one's youth we experience suffering, peer pressure, anger, love, and life itself to become the person that we are. I myself could say that because people just like you the reader and me go through that everyday. <br/><br/>I hope whoever reads this finds it useful. But remember, this article is just my opinion and thoughts about American History X. I respect anyone else's opinion, if they hated it or liked it. I just want to get a point out."
"Timeee","9","1","2","28 November 2007"," Watch it and think about it
","I think racism of any type is simply crazy and stupid, however it just doesn't have the same meaning in different situations. It is not the same whether you have racial views in Africa or in America, whether you belong to the major ethnic group or you are part of the minority. The manifestation of racism might be the same but the substance and the motives are different. In American history x I felt these motives were pretty much unconvincing.<br/><br/>To begin with Derek is not a cattle-like asshole, like many of his skinhead friends, who only embrace racism because they are too limited to think any further; neither he becomes a racist solely for the benefits of being part of the gang (like the majority, I suppose). Derek actually does think, he is a leader- at least that's the idea. As a result when he does become a racist he does it because of an internal belief that this is the correct, sane thing to do. He arguments, he has an opinion based on facts, he is becoming convinced because of these facts- the point is not that he misinterprets things, the point is that he is not a racist because of the emotional trauma, not because his father died, but because he thinks things that way. <br/><br/>In addition his prison rebirth is very unlikely to me. So what was that about after all? He saw one of his gang's members buying pot from a black guy, or a Mexican, i don't remember- so what, is this thing capable to destroy his whole world-view? What did he think, that all white guys have the same ideas as he has? <br/><br/>He met a funny, sympathetic black guy- OK , now don't tell me that Derek, intelligent as he was, thought that all black people were jerks. He was not a racist before his father's death, he actually liked Sweeney!-that part was very artificial, I mean, what is this supposed to mean, that Derek forgot just like that everything he had known about people, just because his father died? It was a trauma, his television interview-outburst might be explained with that, sort of a ""homage"" to the racist dad, but why did he start to hate EVERY black person all of a sudden from then on? Like I said before it wasn't just an emotional thing-it couldn't have been. Derek had his theory of black people being more likely to commit crimes, of taking the jobs of decent white people and so on-there was nothing in the movie that made a counter-argument to these, accepted by Derek; he simply forgot these at the end.<br/><br/>All in all, my observation is that the movie is very well acted, well structured, but not very realistic. Derek's-and for that matter Danny's- sudden changes of their view are totally unconvincing, because they do not come from the right place- Derek is a nazi because he believes in the theory, and there's nothing that should change him so radically, because every experience he has is mainly emotional. Danny probably never was very convinced of anything, so he is actually much more credible than his brother."

This movies certainly did not do such a good job of making many of the black characters sympathetic, except Lamont. I mean come on, 3 guys with guns, one standing on your front porch and one in your yard and one breaking into your car...are we supposed to feel sympathy for them? I did not like the girl who played Derriks girlfriend...it would have been better in a miniseries perhaps if they had showed him longing for her but at the same time, wanting to leave the gang..instead the breakup was so abrupt. I would have liked to see more of the family flashbacks. This movie, besides Lamont, actually made me feel more sympathetic to the skinheads than the minorities (except that horrible grocery store scene) I would buy this movie because I really enjoyed the Edwards performances, and Norton was extraordinarily sexy in those white boxers."

Still it does seem a bit silly and cheapens the film. I mean ""win this game and you leave the courts forever ... deal?""<br/><br/>Come on!<br/><br/>A good film.

I do not know of another actor who could portray Derek Vinyard as effectively as Norton did.<br/><br/>While Furlong's performance isn't quite as convincing as Norton's, he does portray a corrupted innocence that made me actually care for him.

","American History X is a film that on first impression is artistic, yet quite touchy. It raises themes that you don't really want to watch. Racism, violence and segregation - to name a few.<br/><br/>The story is about the Vinyard family. And their involvement with Neo-Nazi racism groups. Derek Vinyard (The ever-fabulous Edward Norton) is the main man. A tough rogue filled with hatred and bitterness against other races, and convinced he must fight against them as a white protestant male. Danny Vinyard (Edward Furlong) is his brother, an impressionable teen who admires his brother above all others.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>The story is harsh though, and told in very interesting ways. Part of it is flashback, part of it present time, part of it is narration by Norton telling of his time spent in prison, for the murder of a black man. And even more imaginative is the way in which events surrounding the racial antagonism are commented and shown via an essay of which Danny is forced to write for the principal of his school, an essay for his own special class - namely - American History X, which is hoped to bring down the hateful feelings, and inflict some sense into him. <br/><br/>With a bunch of gangster chums around the place, exerting and trying to encourage racial hatred it isn't easy. And many fights are depicted. Struggles.<br/><br/>But this film, which is phenomenally brutal, but effective has a big message to convey, and it does it well. <br/><br/>Racism is just a case of hate, and being annoyed at things... And is totally wrong.<br/><br/>I love this picture, it is well made, well acted and well received.<br/><br/>It is also very deep. Making it absorbing and a grand viewing pleasure, even if it is brutal, and brash. This quote may help you understand how deep it is, a passage from Danny's essay:<br/><br/>""So here's what I found out. My conclusion. I figured out that hate is baggage. Life's too short to be p***ed off all the time.""<br/><br/>Highly recommended"

","Yes, I agree, the slow-motion portions are there to make the scenes more dramatic than they need to be. Yes, the black and white for the flashbacks was unnecessary, but overall, this film has done for racism what Homeroom and Elephant did for school shootings.<br/><br/>There is no explanation why Derek becomes a neo-nazi, yes his father was probably a part of it, as well as just being young and influenced by Cameron. It could also be attributed to his surroundings, the way he grew up, but there is no clear answer and that is what makes it so powerful. The fact that you don't have to be poor, you don't have to grow up in terrible surroundings, or have your parents influence you, to hate people that much.<br/><br/>Edward Norton's performance was brilliant, his tone and body language was spot-on, although whenever he cried I was reminded that it was an actor playing a part and not Derek Vineyard. Edward Furlong may have been miscast but he still pulled Danny off very well, the voice-overs being perfectly apathetic.<br/><br/>The cinematography was beautiful, the arrest scene when there was an American flag in the background behind Danny while the policeman was covering Derek's swastika, and the end scene was an amazing reminder of Lester in American Beauty. Red on white will always be the most powerful colors in my mind.<br/><br/>Overall, I loved this film, not because it was ""edgy"" but because it, overall was better than 99% of the films I have seen and it left me shaking and in tears at the end, that is what I call a powerful film."

","I think racism will forever be an issue amongst us human beings, one that won't stop until every last one of us is dead. It is such a big world we live in, that I just don't understand how there could possibly be so much hatred between us. Why do we have to fight like this? Why does color of skin or the look of eyes matter so much? Why can't we all just frickin get along? I know things will never change amongst the living, which is something that pains me because I want to have kids some day...but what sort of world will I be bringing them into? This film does such an amazing job of giving us a reality check on just how compassionate we really are for one another...which isn't a whole lot to be frank. Thank you Snake for highly recommending this to me. 9/10"

","In American History X, a reformed neo-nazi named Derek (Edward Norton) returns home from prison intending to stop his little brother Danny (Edward Furlong), already a member, from following in his footsteps. A story that i am sure has happened a thousand times in real-life, whether it involve neo-Nazis, gangs, or drug addiction. As sad as that is, it sure spawned one of the most powerful movies i have ever seen.<br/><br/>Edward Norton gives one of the best performances ever, and the best from the year 1998. I've said it before and i'll say it again: The Academy sucks. Norton is totally convincing and at times sympathetic. Not to mention, he got pretty damn built for this role. Edward Furlong is also very good as the little brother on the edge, and Stacy Keach is great as the evil head of the group.<br/><br/>Director Tony Kaye tells the story by having Norton's nazi days in black and white flashbacks, and the present day where Norton is freed from prison and his hatred in color. This makes it not only easier to distinguish the past and present scenes, but it somehow makes the scenes more effective. Like Norton saw everything in black and white until he had a tragic experience in prison.<br/><br/>American History X is a powerful, insightful, and very relevant tale of hatred and tragedy, and a film that should be seen by everyone, especially these days. 9/10"
"hitman624","8","1","2","25 January 2005"," The Brother-Brother relationship
","Every time I see this movie the one thing that jumps out at me is how real the relationship between the brothers is. Remove all the Nazi subtext and the relationship between Derek and Danny is exactly like the one I had with my older brother. I've never seen another film capture the essence of an older brother's influence over his younger brother. This film not only does that but makes it a major element to the story. I, myself also have an older brother. The difference in age is the same as it appears to be in American History X. Let me tell you, if my older brother HAD been a destructive neo nazi like Derek, I probably would have been too, just like Danny. I played the same sports my brother did. I watched the same movies. I listened to the same music. I tried to emulate him in every way possible. Even recently I started a job with a local utility company. The same job he started in when he was my age. American History X does an excellent job of showing the remarkable influence of an older brother, and how he accepts the responsibility that comes with it. When Sweeney visits Derek in jail, he tells him that his younger brother is headed down the same path as he is. Derek immediately shoots back that Danny is not his responsibility. Whether Derek wants the responsibility or not, he has great influence over Danny and must use it responsibly. Unfortunately, Derek realizes this too late. That's the essence of this story to me. The struggle of an older brother to save himself in order to save his younger brother. Ed Norton plays both the responsible and the irresponsible Derek magically. This film goes from being a good film to a great film because of his performance. The most realistic portrayal I've ever seen of someone dealing with family problems. 8 Stars out of 10."
"fmpemy","10","1","2","20 January 2005"," to make it simple.... amazing
","I can't even begin to comment on how moving this film is. Not moving as in pro Nazi-ism, but on how hatred can ruin America's culture and modern society. I love this film, although it is very abrupt and forward. it does a wonderful job of accomplishing the goals that the filmmakers (i believe) were hoping to accomplish. My favorite shot of the whole film was when Derrick finished unloading his clip at the car driving away, and they go to a shot of Derrick walking back to the wounded gang member. They put it in slow mo to emphasize the anger and hatred on his face. This shot goes far deeper than any other shot of the same length would. This even shows how damn good of an actor Edward Norton is. This film is just so powerful, and just so moving that I could talk all day about it."
"ilikeimdb","7","1","2","14 January 2005"," Edward Norton Gives a Great Performance
","Edward Norton gives, at least for most of the movie, and incredibly powerful and scary portrayal of a Nazi skinhead, replete with the directed violence and deep-well of hatred of minorities, etc. we would normally associate with this character. What makes his performance special is his laser-like intensity brought to all things skinhead, at least for the pre-prison part of the movie. The movie starts to unravel during Norton's transitional phase to someone more sensitive and socialized. That transition isn't given enough context and his prison ""friendship"" isn't sufficient to believe he's a changed man. It's all too convenient a plot crutch. Norton's asked to make this shape-shifting believable, but the screenplay lets him down. Nevertheless, Norton's excellent performance deserves to be watched regardless of plot quibbles. N.B. I didn't read the other IMDb reviews of this movie before writing mine (which is the way it should be) -- so I'm now curious to see if others had the same conclusion."

","I've read some of the other comments and I must say that people, who comment this movie by saying that it's worse than Braveheart have no sense of reality at all. If you want adventure and false feelings and fantasy, yes, you can enjoy Braveheart or any other movie, but if you in any way want to see a movie that tells about the human nature, this is it.<br/><br/>I think that 10 is not enough for this film. It has the same ingenious daily atmosphere as Tarantino's Reservoir dogs, even though Tarantino is about pure violence while this.. this is so true and so bad. How can you describe better the stupidity of misled young people. How can you describe better the look on a mans face when he realizes that there is nothing he can say to make these young men understand that they are wrong?<br/><br/>The actors and directing just makes me weak. Edvard Norton is one of the very best actors I have ever seen, and this is definitely his best performance so far. There is not even a one bad actor in this film.<br/><br/>This is not just about neo-nazism, this is about violence in family, about love, stupidity, ignorance, repent. A person, who rates this lower than 10 HAS NO HEART. No heart, boys and girls, no heart."

I remember after I saw this movie I was not in a good mood at all and I won't get into how I felt because I may offend someone.  As a human being I really understood the message and embraced it with open arms but also I was very offended due to my ethnic background particularly by Ethan Suplee's great perfomance of Seth(someone I would love to cut into a million pieces - believe me), Fairuza Balk plays another character who deserves a kick in the face as well but she does well.  I know it's just a movie and like I said I understood the message and took it for what it was - I enjoyed the movie as a whole, both of the Edwards do a great job as the misguided brothers but it's a disturbing reminder that racism does exist and no matter how good this movie was, it really made me angry"

","American History X is Edward Norton's showpiece. It is the film that shows the world that Norton is the De Niro of our time. Transforming himself in the intelligent skinhead Derek Vineyard is a textbook example of great acting. His co-stars, even Eddie Furlong, combine to make this movie a great one. The message of the movie is not subtle but hits you right in the face with reality. People hate, and that hate can be turned around to hurt you in the worst way. This film doesn't lag for a second and every frame is loaded with meaning and emotion. This isn't a movie for the faint hearted and if you don't like what you are watching then it will be even harder for you to digest the fact that there are people out there just like every character in the movie. I think that everyone is racist to some degree and this movie has you both agreeing with what Derek has to say but at the same time thinking that you're not in the same boat as he is. You don't hate like he does. Well you may not but you can't help but be moved by his saga. Bottom Line: This movie deserves the place that it has on the top 250 and if you haven't seen it yet then you owe it to yourself to check it out. If you have seen it then go and see it again."

"FeverDog","7","1","2","6 August 2000"," Terrific at first, but something's not right... (SPOILER)
","I finally saw this again on cable this week.  When I first saw this in theatres, I of course was totally blown away. It was stunningly acted, beautifully shot, and, for the subject matter, very restrained, objective, and nonexploitive (the score was a little overbearing, though).  All these aspects remain in my second viewing, but the ending seems to negate everything that precedes it.  Throughout the film the story is Derek's hatred and his subsequent enlightenment and how Daniel is headed down the same destructive path.  We're led to believe that Daniel, by being made to write about his brother, will realize the error of his ways and change his outlook while he's still young and impressionable to do so.<br/><br/>
So if this is the point of the story, why do the filmmakers have Daniel murdered in his high school bathroom by some kid that got in his face? Obviously, since he's dead, everything that he just learned the night before means absolutely nothing.  Are the filmmakers saying that it was already too late to help Daniel?  Why give more pain to Derek and his family in Daniel's brutal, practically random slaying?  Derek's already learned what he needed to.  Or did the filmmakers just want one more final shocker to tidy up the movie. Why not have him live, and the audience walk out hoping, praying, that he becomes a better man? (Same problem in American Beauty.)<br/><br/>
(And what are the odds that a high school bathroom would be completely empty right before class starts? Just wonderin'...)<br/><br/>I am in no way trashing this film. We can add another 90's Oscar theft to the list [Morgan Freeman, Julianne Moore, Tom Cruise, Martin Scorsese, PT Anderson (I could go on), and now Mr. Norton]. And it's always great to see Beverly D'Angelo.  But when I discovered American History X in IMDb's top 100, I had to speak up. <br/><br/>7/10"

Undoubtedly the star and shining light of this film was Edward Norton, who finally broke through into the elite of Hollywood, where he fully deserves to be. His portrayal of Derek Vineyard was flawless, hardened bigot one moment, reformed and remorseful killer the next. No doubt that in any other year he would have walked off with Best Actor, his performance was breathtaking. Ed Furlong also delivered a really top performance, as the younger impressionable Danny, delivering his best performance since Terminator 2.

I rated this film 9/10, and the only thing keeping it from 10/10 was the script, which occasionally gets a little preachy, and at times I was aware that the characters were functioning as a mechanism to try and educate me, the viewer, not talking to each other.

","American History X hits America and its wide, problematic racism right on its present spot. Many racism-related films make you hate hatred. This film rather wants to get to the bottom of it, making a statement of what need to be done.<br/><br/>It doesn't just show racist people, in this case neo-nazis, as frustrated, lonely people reaching out to whomever willingly to accept them. The main character, played convincingly by Edward Norton, is an intelligent orator and charismatic leader, who let his black side explain the problems of society, and act accordingly.<br/><br/>Hate is shown from both sides. Good reasons for hate are presented. At the same time the narrowsighted aspect of it carefully comes to light, making you see that hate blinds your good judgement. Making you reject there is a flip side to the matter. If you see beyond the entertaining value of this film (which is great), it might actually grab you, wanting you to help those who hate.<br/><br/>This movie also makes a huge point of the effect trusted persons arguments have on others.

","I went to see this a couple of weeks ago, and it was one of the better movies that ive seen this year. Even though it came out in USA last year its only just been released where i live. This was an excellent drama, some very brutal scenes in the movie. It was also very scary because Edward Nortons performance as a skinhead, was so utterly convincing. He's definately one of the best actors around.      A few negative things stuck out in the movie though. For example when Derek is telling Danny about his turnaround in prison, Danny accepts he's right straight away, and if Derek was so intelligent and smart, how come he was so easily turned towards hating blacks? I know his father put a few thoughts in his head, and he was killed by a black gang, but please!! I also thought the slow motion scenes were a bit too ""Hollywood"". I shouldn't be too picky though, because although the movie has a few flaws, American History X is still a stunner."

"Don-102","9","1","2","13 April 1999"," A Powerful History Lesson For Us ALL !!!
","The third best film of 1998 is a tenacious, overwhelming depiction of hate for no reason and stupidity that is learned.  Everybody should see this picture, no matter how old, or what color, race, or creed.  AMERICAN HISTORY X is not profound, is not symbolic, and does not have a hero who lets us know at the end that this is all wrong.  In fact, Ed Norton is quite the anti-hero, even after release from prison.  You see he killed two African-Americans who were robbing his car on his own property.  It was certainly NOT self-defense.<br/><br/>AMERICAN HISTORY X is a message movie, no doubt about it.  But the message is not told in words or speeches by the actors.  Experiences tell the story of some very small-minded people who believe they have the temerity to ""rid"" a portion of California of ""unwanted, inferior races.""  A racial basketball game punches what the opening sequence pulled off right home.  Norton is a 'lieutenant' in the D.O.C., a neo-Nazi organization.  He is the leader while a sinister Stacey Keach recruits and brainwashes from a headquarters somewhere in the city (Venice Beach, CA).  If the whites win, the blacks must leave the court, forever.  I can only imagine the cheers or jeers this scene brought about in audiences who saw the picture during its brief theater run.  In fact, it was probably in the public's best interest not to keep it out too long.  This is sad, but a point is presented here.  Smart, open-minded people will see the senselessness of it all and see racism for what it is: sheer stupidity and ignorance.<br/><br/>The film is presented in an interesting narrative method, with flashbacks in black and white before Norton's incarceration.  After his release, we see in living, breathing color the scary gangland that is the racial atmosphere in this section of Cali.  The tragedy of it all is Norton's little brother, played by Edward Furlong (TERMINATOR II), who is clearly headed down the same swasticized path Norton went down.  In prison, Norton's status in the neo-Nazi underworld was heightened to God-like and Furlong, young and impressionable, looks to carry the torch.  Throughout, we see scenes of demeaning race relations and brutal dialogue and ideas put forth blatantly by the skinheads.  Ed Norton, one of the best actors of his generation, bulked up considerably to look the part of the sick skinhead, but after some waking up in jail, he has had enough.<br/><br/>Rumors spread rampantly that Norton and director Tony Kaye fought while filming and that a disagreement ensued.  Whoever's ""vision"" won out is the correct one, because this film never steps wrong.  It may be headed down a predictable path, but there are multiple ways this picture could end.  Doom and tragedy are in the air and you just know someone is going to die for no other reason than learned racism and philosophy on different creeds.  It's a shame that the ideas come from someone who should've been the most responsible person in these kid's lives.  He was incapable of shielding them from these idiotic thoughts of single-minded bigotry.  Catholics, Jews, Prodestines, African-Americans, and most importantly, skinhead Nazis should see this important work of art and think about the shame of it all.<br/><br/>RATING: 10 of 10"

I am afraid that contrary to the seemingly endless praise given to this film and its director, Tony Kaye, and indeed recommendations from my friend that I should see this film, when I did I felt cheated and annoyed. There's no denying that what the film portrays is shocking and powerful, and that Edward Norton's performance is equally powerful, almost coming close in intensity to De Niro's Bickle, and the set-pieces are well made, but the inability for the filmmakers' to create a convincing story spoilt the whole film for me - the way we see in endless flashbacks (often the sign of a weak storyteller), Norton's firstly ordinary, sane, likable character's seemingly easy conversion to a Nazi maniac just by his dad uttering a few racist sentences at the dinner table is frankly ridiculous. Plus his seemingly easy conversion back from a Nazi maniac while in prison, just through speaking to a nice black guy. I'm sorry, but it just negates the whole film's power. Not to mention the endless flashy camera techniques used by former ad director Kaye, NOTE: slow motion close ups of a running shower tap does not a good film make. The film opens on a black and white shot of the ocean, for no apparent reason, leading to the conclusion that Kaye thought he could appear as a 'clever' and 'sophisticated' filmmaker by showing us an 'arty' opening sequence. This kind of pretencion is as irritating as the lack of convincing back story. Nope, sorry Mr Kaye, wasn't for me."

I'm not talking about the script, which even Kaye said he hated, or the content, which is volatile, but the movie as art unto itself.

This detracted from the movie and should have been detailed a bit more completely.<br/><br/>In addition, I don't feel like such a drastic change in attitude and behavior could have occurred from merely the events that happened in this film.

","I finally saw the famous ""American History X"" and while it was a decent movie, I'm reading here that it is one of the greatest films ever made? Maybe the greatest ever made? Wow, those are some accolades. I'm thinking, hey it was decent, but are you kidding me? <br/><br/>The film isn't bad, but no matter how one tries to disguise it, preachy is preachy. There are a few things not too evident in the film. One is how many ""typical"" Americans totally concur with the societal views of Norton's character, especially everything he said at the dinner table. Maybe people don't want another Hitler around, but millions do feel the way he did about immigrants and why America has been falling into the toilet. So when they come out the mouth with a guy with a huge swastika tattooed on his body, they appear to be ""extreme."" Considering that even right now, at this second,with racism so high among non-whites towards whites, and many millions of Americans being tired of the advantages illegal immigrants have for instance, those views aren't always so ""extreme"" after all.<br/><br/>And the racism in the film - it's predominantly white-on-black, and again, since the whites here are skinheads and Nazis, their views seem ""extreme"" despite the millions that agree (again, short of reviving Hitler). It is rare we see black-on-white racism in the movie, and even when we hear (or see in the deleted scenes) that the leader and the fat guy got attacked by blacks, they don't get too much sympathy from the viewer. The black kid in the final violent scene probably came the closest to showing any black racism, muttering the phrase ""white boy"" earlier in the film and getting in Danny's face.<br/><br/>The turnaround of Norton's character in the prison is just too convenient. The film even gets a little sappy here - watch the neo-nazi lighten up to his black cleaning partner, because the black guy does funny things and makes him laugh. It's almost like this black guy was there for Norton's amusement, putting on a minstrel show, even wearing a sheet over his head imitating a klansman and making funny sounds. Look, now they are even talking about basketball together! If you spend one-on-one time with anyone long enough you will lighten up to them, but to change your whole philosophy? <br/><br/>Even Norton's reason for his prison stay - gangbangers don't go after revenge anymore? After what happened, they don't even go after the family? Heck, they even knew the address!<br/><br/>I think the film may have been much better if the part that was supposed to be tagged on at the end of the film was actually filmed and inserted. ""American History X"" was a decent movie, and the acting was especially good. But it is a very flawed film, too easy, and really doesn't reflect reality as much as so many think it does."
"wayupnorth","7","2","7","11 October 2002"," flawed execution, but Norton is amazing
","By now you probably know the basic plot, so I won't recount it.  The problem is that the overall message of the film - racism is malignant and doesn't provide the solace it promises - is completely undermined by Norton's presentation.  He gives a truly stunning performance, but his character (Danny) is so much more appealing when he's the mesmerizing racist poster boy.  When he returns from prison, after having sorted out all of his prior racist ideology, he's much less interesting to watch.  It was actually disturbing to me how sexy he was, shirtless in the street, after having just killed someone in one of the most violent ways I've ever encountered. It's hard to buy the idea that racism is bad when it comes in such an attractive package, especially when its opposite is presented as feminized and weak.<br/><br/>This movie had high ambitions, and almost reached them, but in the end misses its target by letting Norton be TOO good."
"tfrizzell","Null","2","7","19 September 2000"," One of the Most Important Films of the 1990s, Should Be Required Viewing
","""American History X"" was overlooked in 1998, but was probably the best film of the year, with the exception of ""The Thin Red Line"".  The film deals with a young man (Edward Norton in an Oscar-nominated performance) who goes over the edge when his fire-fighting father is killed trying to put out a blaze in a crack-house in an African-American neighborhood.  Now Norton becomes a neo-Nazi skinhead who falls in with an evil businessman (Stacey Keach). After Norton kills two African-Americans who are trying to steal his truck, he gets sentenced to a prison term which is much shorter than it should have been.  On the outside, his younger brother (Edward Furlong) is becoming the same type of evil person that Norton is.  When Norton gets out of prison, he shows that he has had a change of heart and realizes that hate is wrong. After Furlong realizes that Norton has truly changed, he wants to know what happened to Norton during his prison stay.  Norton tells his story in flashbacks which are shown in black-and-white.  We see Norton being cut down to size while he's in prison.  He is betrayed by those same type of people that he thought he supported and befriends a young African-American inmate. When Norton learns that his new friend is in prison for an even longer stretch than him for a somewhat minor crime (trying to steal a television), Norton realizes that the system that he hates so much is really more fair to him than minorities.  Norton's story touches Furlong and they abandon a lifestyle which has almost destroyed their lives.  However, there are enemies lurking in the shadows (Keach's neo-Nazis and local African-Americans) and revenge against Norton and his family may be a real possibility in the end.  ""American History X"" is an unflinching film which is very difficult to sit through, but is well-worth one's time.  The screenplay is excellent and the editing techniques are surprisingly impressive as well (cutting from vivid color to black-and-white sequences). Director and cinematographer Tony Kaye was disgusted at the final-cut of this film and went public beforehand to acknowledge that the final product was not his vision.  This testimonial created controversy and stole much of the film's thunder when it was first released; this was really unfortunate. The greatest thing that makes ""American History X"" work are the players. Edward Norton is excellent, as usual.  Edward Furlong shows amazing range as well.  Beverly D'Angelo, Elliott Gould, and Stacey Keach all do the best work of their careers as well.  An amazing accomplishment and one of those films that should be required viewing to all young people.  Probably the most under-rated film of the 1990s.  5 stars out of 5."
"vbz","6","2","7","21 January 2000"," weak directorially, strong performances nevertheless
","The scandal of Tony Kaye disowning his work and condemning New Line who took it away before he could realize his 90-minute cut is well publicized by now. And it's no surprise why the director became so enraged: American History X is definitely in need of major editing. In it's two hour theatrical version, this study of California skinheads seems haphazard and even amateurish at times. The studio's attempt to improve the film actually made it much worse:the picture looks like an effort by an ambitious, self-indulgent high school student assisted by his far less inspired teacher. Most of the black-and-white sequences (flashbacks of Norton's and Furlong's life as skinhead brothers) are much more powerful and beautifully shot than the trite and cheaply melodramatic color scenes set in the present day. One cannot help but contemplate this film's potential on all levels of production: for one, it should have used a more urgent and appropriate soundtrack of modern hip-hop and hardcore instead of the typical Hollywood solution to all dramas which we've all heard literally hundreds of times; and also cut down on the slow motion, arguably the most gratuitous since The Postman. Still, Norton's extraordinary performance and several thought-provoking scenes make one wonder what the movie could have been if Kaye was allowed to perfect his material without intervention."

"marcslope","5","2","8","28 July 2003"," God bless Edward Norton...
","...and God grant him a less grandstanding, more subtle director than Tony Kaye, who has piled cliché on top of cliché in this diatribe against neo-Nazism and poured on the anti-racist moralizing as if he had invented the concept. You want faux-home movies of kids at the shore to symbolize lost innocence? You got it. Slow-motion violence? Check. Black-and-white flashbacks to contrast against the blood-spattered color of the present-day sequences? Why not. Pseudo-religious, semi-liturgical musical scoring to mythologize and elegize the predictable dramatics? It's dripping with it. The kind of rote plotting that demands one character will have to be sacrificed for the sins of another? That's here, too. The storytelling is resolutely episodic, a series of (predictable) set pieces: the basketball court confrontation, the convenience-store riot (which is admittedly frightening stuff), the prison gang-rape, the neo-Nazi rally. It's all prosaically told, but Norton does create a complex portrait out of little, carefully conveying Derek's anger, conflicting familial feelings, fierce protectiveness, and growing consciousness. Some very good veteran actors help out -- Beverly D'Angelo, Elliott Gould, Stacy Keach -- and Avery Brooks somehow manages to turn his angelic-teacher turn into more than a device. God knows a subject this timely and vital deserves more nuance and analysis, but the brute force of Norton's acting and the excellent support from little-brother Furlong (though Kaye, predictably again, lingers too long and in too-relentless closeup on all that anguished doe-eyed adolescence) ultimately win out over ham-fisted direction and unimaginative screen writing."
"muons","5","2","9","16 July 2018"," An unimpressive family drama which fails to deliver
","This is a bland story of a white supremacist and his transformation following his jail term. Despite all the hype and awards, I fail to see anything special about the movie. At times, Derek's long boring monologues almost put me asleep. Take the scene, for example, including the jewish history teacher at family dinner table. On the surface, there's tension and drama but the whole subplot is kept so long with a stale and contrived dialogue that the tension can't be sustained and the audience is tired. Derek's transform from an effervescent skinhead to a contrite preacher also looks very cliche and cheesy. A laundry boy's unilateral clownish acts towards an obnoxious working partner eventually warms up Neo-Nazi's heart and he repents of his past. Besides that some things don't add up at all. While Derek disapproves of his neo-nazi prison gang's dealings with hispanics, he is punished by the gang because he plays basketball with black inmates. Later, when he refuses to join the gang and chooses solitude in prison, the gang which were initially brutal towards him simply let him go. The female characters of the family are poorly developed and shown weak and subdued. The mother is totally indifferent to her sons' street activities. Their room is decorated with swastika flags and all sorts of white supremacist trash, which screams trouble but all she does is to smoke and cough in her bedroom. When the younger one follows the footsteps of the older sibling in prison, she then remembers to ask for help. Why doesn't she act before? Towards the end of the movie, it turns out the racism runs deep in the family starting with the slain dad. But that thread is not followed further. Ed Norton's acting is in general good but far from Oscar worthy. All in all, this is an ordinary crime story and family drama with gazillions of clones produced as tv series or dvd bin movies."

The magnifying lens into people's souls is thought - provoking unlike anything else I've ever seen, most notably when the most ironic of climaxes occurs. Because of their lack of true racism, Derek denounces the Aryan Brotherhood and is raped, beaten and left for dead, only for him to be saved by Lamont, a black - man. To see the anguish Derek endures to try to repair his misdeeds, first through his friendship with Lamont, and later through his little brother is heart - wrenching and for Danny (Edward Furlong) to make the ultimate sacrifice in the name of racism provided a visceral reaction few movies have gotten from me.

","Very few films have the ability and bravery to leave a gut full of mixed emotions like 'American History X'. 1998's infamous neo nazi tale stars Edward Norton as hate mongering skinhead Derek Vinyard, a man so engulfed with hatred towards the black community of L.A. that its driven himself and his family toward a world of violent and jaded savagery. 'American History X' creates its characters through a series of black and white flashbacks that are narrated by Derek's impressionable younger brother Daniel, played by Edward Furlong. Daniel, who has witnessed his brothers violent threshold reach its fiery peak, has also decided to brand African Americans as enemy no.1. but hasn't suffered the consequences of his sibling idol as Derek's reign as racist leader lands him in jail for murder. Unlike Derek, Daniel has the opportunity to exit the world of white supremacy before it's too late as he sees Derek surprisingly turn his back on the nazi cult he helped create and ride a road to reform and regret. Director Tony Kaye has made a movie of relentless force and brutal vulnerability, a bold, aggressive and confronting vision that few young film makers fail to achieve. 'American History X' is not only a film, but a lasting legacy in fundamental and human values we all need to seek and adopt."

And the story goes by. Personally, I admired the movie very much and I guess it is one of the best movies of all times. Our story-line here is the present and we move forward to see in the process flashbacks to previous events in the past and here was a thoughtful great touch to represent these events in black and white. Our Actors here were the best with flawless and unforgettable performance. The plot however is the one element you can doubt as I thought that it wasn't enough to build the twist on it and it needed a little convincing time and reason but I guess the movie here wasn't trying to lecturer those who are in the same path that Derek took So in a complete evaluation I give this movie 9 out of 10 and I encourage you to watch it."

","I finally watched this recently and was quite surprised by good it was. The movie deals with the touchy subject of racism and ends with redemption and sadness. Edward Norton was intense and brutal as the skinhead Derek Vinyard. His brother, Danny idolizes him and wants to follow in his footsteps by being a white supremacist. There was one scene in particular where Derek tries to make a point by almost attacking his family at the dinner table I thought was very claustrophobic and tense. The majority of the movie takes place in a series of black-and-white flashbacks that shows Derek's reign and killing two black teens for stealing his car. <br/><br/>Three years later, Danny is excited for his brother to get out of jail, but finds that he's reformed and ashamed of his past. Derek tries to help Danny change his ways before it's too late. I can't believe it has taken me this long to see this film.

"dexter-vane","10","1","3","24 May 2015"," Beautiful and tragic
","This is one of my all-time favourite movies. Edward Norton does an amazing job, playing basically two very different characters throughout the movie. Edward Furlong also does a great job. The story is everything you can hope for. It has deep characters that go through tragedy and failure, with a glimpse of hope at the end, that is even more tragically shattered immediately. The story is about ideology, how ideology works and spreads, hate, the root of hate and change. All of this is brought to the screen in an absolutely stunning way. Not only great black & white footage, but also breathtaking closeups and slow- motion make for a beautiful movie. The music is just beautiful as well. This movie stuck with me for quite a while (maybe it had a little more impact for me than others because I'm German, who knows), and I still think about it a lot. I definitely recommend this movie.

"lemrogers","9","1","3","21 May 2015"," Emotional Manipulation at it's finest
","American History X – Emotional Manipulation at its finest <br/><br/>Films are made with the intention to entertain, to document and to tell a story, but the ones that stand out from the crowd are those that dictate audience emotions; something Tony Kaye has mastered in American History X. Of course, this film isn't for everyone and it's this emotional manipulation that is perhaps the reason why as viewers may not take a submissive stance and refuse to allow themselves to be controlled this way but for me, Kaye's unconventional take on emotional response makes AHX one of the best films of its generation. <br/><br/>The narrative and stylistic techniques used by Kaye, McKenna and crew create such incredible levels of realism throughout a film where the majority of viewers will not be able to relate but alas this doesn't matter to us, we still feel just as connected, or disconnected in certain ways, to the characters and events, specifically the brothers Danny and Derek. On the surface, two 'despicable' human beings with little to no positive attributes but Kaye blurs the lines between hero and villain magnificently with Derek's redemption story and his little brother's longing for guidance. The inner battle that we see Derek, and eventually Danny, go through, makes their transformations even more spectacular. Kaye's ability to produce this emotion is what makes the film so powerful and no scene displays this as much as the basketball scene.<br/><br/>Without spoiling the film, the scene basically portrays Derek and his gang taking on another group, race vs race, in a game of basketball. Now if Kaye were to take away all the abusive and racist dialogue from both camps, as well as the prominent symbolism of the swastika, the audience would be forgiven for thinking this was just another underdog sports movie: the protagonist manages to win against all odds even despite the opposition cheating. It's Kaye's magnificent use of both the dialogue and the symbolism that make this such a chilling and powerful scene. Almost everything about this sequence makes us want to cheer for Derek with the camera work focusing significantly on his team and emotional crescendos popping up every time Derek scores a basket, courtesy of Anne Dudley who makes the whole film ripe with tension. The manipulation is so perfect, we become dragged along with their triumphant victory and we come to ask ourselves who the real villains are in the scene. We're brought right back down to earth, feeling completely ashamed that we essentially cheered on such despicable characters, however, by the symbolism of the swastika on Derek's chest and the vile dialogue. It's this technique that Kaye uses to cement this inner conflict within the audience, often switching from scenes of moral progression to flashbacks of Derek in his heyday. <br/><br/>Pulling away from that scene and to the whole film in general, the overall emotional response that it creates within audiences is something which I've rarely, if ever, experienced watching a film. Edward Norton gives what might just be the best performance of his career providing such raw emotion with simple glazes into the camera and his co-star Edward Furlong portrays the younger brother looking for a path to follow perfectly. The cinematography gives some of the greatest shots seen in modern cinema, with Kaye also not afraid to make use of obvious tropes such as slow-mo and chilling sound to create tension. Still, these work magnificently throughout the film, creating memorable moment after memorable moment, none perhaps more memorable than the infamous 'curb stomp' which was done to perfection. <br/><br/>Of course, with the subject matter it has, the film has attracted some controversy, with viewers suggesting Derek's redemption was accepted too easily and portrays an unrealistically swift realisation amongst both brothers, but for me, that's what makes this film great. Not only is it a powerful character study but it also puts across a strong message. Kaye is brutal and unbiased in the film as all races are 'thrown to the dogs' so to speak. Unfortunately, there are still so many children like Danny being moulded by their environments in the wrong way and whilst progress is still being made, it isn't happening fast enough."

","I hadn't seen this for a few years, it's still a compelling, provocative, violent and important movie. Edward Norton earned a best actor nod for his spellbinding portrayal of a violent neo-Nazi gang leader who ends up in prison for murder.<br/><br/>He is fantastic here, you literally can't take your eyes off him. The entire movie is well made, well acted and gripping from beginning to end as we watch (through black and white flashbacks) 'Derek' begin to question his beliefs after going to prison and then transform upon his release, turning his back on his Nazi gang and finding a new purpose, to save his brother from talking the same destructive path.<br/><br/>Edward Furlong (what happened to him?) plays the younger influential brother 'Danny' and it is through his school paper ""American History X"" and narration that this story comes to life. He does a good job and I liked how the story was told. All the sub roles are well done too including Elliott Gould, Ethan Suplee and a creepy Stacy Keach.<br/><br/>There are images from this movie that never leave you; the ""curb"" scene is just... and the look in his eyes as Derek is arrested after. The shower scene in prison and the school washroom at the end. A powerful message to this movie. 3/9/15"
"lucasversantvoort","7","1","3","5 May 2015"," Good character drama, lackluster social study
","I remember watching this film in school when I was about 15 or so. Needless to say, it was an impactful experience. American History X is without a doubt an emotionally charged experience, but the way it's all handled is also ironically where I feel things go a bit wrong.<br/><br/>It's nighttime. Danny (Edward Furlong) is trying to sleep, but his older brother Derek (Edward Norton) having loud sex with his girlfriend is keeping him up. Suddenly, he notices a few black men trying to steal Derek's car. He alerts Derek who, armed with nothing but his boxers and a handgun, kills one of the men, shoots another one and tries to shoot at the remaining one driving away, but to no avail. Danny, seeing what his brother wrought, looks at Derek while he walks angrily toward the black man he wounded earlier. The film then cuts to the present, shot in color (as opposed to the B/W flashbacks), as Danny meets with the principal due to him writing a paper on Hitler's Mein Kampf. The principal (Avery Brooks), who also used to be Derek's teacher, tries to explain to Danny that it's Derek, now serving a prison sentence, who made him this way, but he doesn't get through to him. Instead, he gives him a new assignment: to write a paper on his brother. The film then crosscuts between flashbacks to how Derek became a neo-Nazi skinhead, how he got incarcerated, etc. and the present, showing Danny and Derek, who has changed his ways while in prison, trying to make it in their day-to-day lives.<br/><br/>It's to director Tony Kaye's credit that the film is the emotional journey it is. He makes extensive use of dramatic orchestral and choral music (courtesy of Anne Dudley), slow-motion and black-and-white photography to enhance the drama and he mostly succeeds. Also great are Norton and Furlong's performances who not only excel in their individual scenes, but exhibit a chemistry in their scenes together, a sense that these are indeed two brothers who've lived together.<br/><br/>I do have a few issues with the film however. It has an unhealthy tendency to give a lot of screen time to neo-Nazi ideology. We of course know that the filmmakers are not proponents of this ideology through the existence of characters like the benevolent principal Sweeney, the black inmate Lamont and the evil skinhead leader Cameron, the subplot of how Derek became a neo-Nazi (he was fueled more by anger than ideology and was subsequently easily manipulated by Cameron), the fact that principal Sweeney came to visit Derek in prison after Derek was raped by skinheads because he befriended Lamont and tells him that he cannot run away, thus ensuring the safety of his family, but that he has to stay with them and try to make amends. Make no mistake, the film doesn't in any way portray neo-Nazis as good, but the incessant focus on discussions with Derek spouting racist ideology are strange in that you realize the film actually seems to spend more time there than providing a balanced view and social context. I know it's an unfair comparison, but remember The Wire? That series spent countless hours (which a film doesn't have obviously) explaining the complex cyclical relationship between the police and criminals. It gave insight into the hopeless prospects of many poor blacks and showed how sometimes joining a gang is the only viable option. Despite the fact that American History X isn't fundamentally racist, it doesn't give us enough social context to get rid of that nagging feeling that things could've been more balanced.<br/><br/>Also relevant is that apparently the film's ending is an alternate one. Instead of hearing the dead Danny quote Lincoln's 1861 Inaugural Address, we would see Derek unable to deal with Danny's death and shaving his head, thus becoming a skinhead again. This would then tie the whole plot together and show how the film's really about 'the endless cycle of violence'. But, at least according to IMDb's trivia page, this was altered after Norton objected. I can see why as that would've been an even more hopeless ending, but I wonder if the original ending wouldn't have been better. As it is, we see Derek and Danny truly bonding after which Danny is shot by the same black boy he insulted earlier. The film thus ends with blacks being the aggressors which results in the white characters we've come to know and understand either being dead or emotionally traumatized. We can't really look at it from the boy's point of view either, because the film doesn't grant us context about his way of life, save for a shocked close-up of his face as he realizes what he's done. Again, like the film's excessive focus on racist ideology, this ending leaves a bad taste in one's mouth, despite Danny's quote about how 'hate is baggage', etc. At least Derek going skinhead again would have softened the racist angle and strengthened the 'cycle of violence' point of view.<br/><br/>All in all, it's hard to summarize my feelings toward American History X. I appreciate all the potent melodrama director Kaye and screenwriter McKenna create, I like Derek's character development, principal Sweeney, Lamont, etc., but I can't help but feel the film should have provided a more balanced social context à la The Wire."

","I'm just going to put spoiler just to be safe because I hate it when anything is given away in movies..<br/><br/>Watching this movie, it feels almost as if my mind has adapted another view.

By far this is the most intense movie i have ever seen. Events that occur are harsh and definitely drastic. <br/><br/>The acting is unbelievable.

And it isn't even the movie thats the problem, its the impact it would take affect on a viewer. Racism and I mean look at the kid who killed his girlfriend and cut her limbs into pieces. Where did he think of that? He LOVED the show Dexter and thats what Dexter does, cut bodies into pieces. I honestly could see that happening with this movie, someone symbolizing the first hour of this movie, up to when he grows hair. <br/><br/>Despite that one piece, this movie is incredible. The way that Edward Norton does this character is truly incredible and he deserved that Oscar more than anyone else that year, well I guess Tom Hanks in Saving Private Ryan did pretty good too.<br/><br/>This movie really shows the impact of the older brother and how much his younge brother is taking after him and how he is the one that can change him to being a better person and lose the racism.

The movie goes back and forth between the older brother's life before going to prison and his life after he gets out. The acting is impeccable and the story very good and the message timeless(especially with the current situation all over Europe).

"Hawkensian","8","1","3","30 September 2014"," Although it is somewhat heavy handed, American History X has great performances and a shocking brutality that leaves a large impression on you.
","The film is carried by Edward Norton, he portrays his character Derek Vinyard with real gusto and vitriol; what a howling, credibility defacing decision it was for Robert Benigni to trump Norton at the Oscars for his vexing role in the saccharine turd that is Life is Beautiful.<br/><br/>Vinyard is an intelligent young man from a middle-class suburban home, however he rapidly develops fervent fascist views after his father is murdered by a black gunman. Vinyard has clear leadership skills and he channels them in all the wrong directions. His fierce oration makes him a notable figure in the Californian neo-Nazi movement, bringing him to the attention of veteran racist Cameron Alexander (Stacy Keach), who is well cast as the creepy, manipulative leader. The influence of both Derek and Cameron mean that Derek's younger brother, the rather more placid Danny (Edward Furlong), also harbours dangerous neo-Nazism, although not with the same zeal as his brother.<br/><br/>To its merit, the film is unrestrained in its depiction of violent racism. With their foolish understanding of Nazism, the swastika adorned skinheads have a palpable hatred of all things un-Aryan. No one's hatred is greater than Vinyard's, who commits a brutal act of street, or rather curb, justice that has since become infamous. So abhorrent is the scene that it entered my top 10 most painful scenes in cinema history.<br/><br/>It's Vinyard's act of violence that lands him in prison, where, perhaps predictably, he has a change of heart. I felt that the manner in which Vinyard changes is rather too pronounced and straight forward, the transformation of such an extreme psychology should have been more nuanced in its depiction – the shift of a psychological complex is one of subtle shades, not clearly defined, narrative friendly episodes.<br/><br/>However, I think a good argument can be had about Vinyard's rapid change. Beneath all the extremism is a measured, intelligent man; he isn't an ignorant, retrograde fool, he's a subject one can work with. After all, his realisation isn't completely instantaneous, he integrates with the white thugs of his wing, the Aryan Brotherhood or whatever they call themselves, but their business practices are at odds with his strict principles. Combine this with his repeated and isolated work detail with the black Lamont (Guy Torry) (which I should think is an unlikely scenario for obvious reasons), and his sudden and considerable change of circumstance could have woken him up.<br/><br/>There's a whiff of stereotypical characterisation at times; the two principal black characters of the film Dr. Sweeney (Avery Brooks) and the aforementioned Lamont are within the realm of the stock character, the latter particularly. They can both be deemed as 'Magical Negroes', a term that refers to black characters whose sole purpose is to serve the development of a white character. Sweeney is Derek's former and Danny's current high school teacher. He is a respected, righteous man with a seemingly infinite wisdom; he manages to disarm everyone with sagacious monologues and philosophical questions that are delivered with his deep, portentous voice. His character is heavily influenced by civil rights figures such as Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr.<br/><br/>Lamont, the inmate who Vinyard has repeated laundry duty with, is portrayed by comedian Guy Torry; I haven't seen his stand-up, however his manic, animated performance is certainly reminiscent of a Chris Rock gig. He's a rather frivolous character that's little more than narrative function that services Vinyard's character development.<br/><br/>It's not a surprise to find that director Tony Kaye's career began in advertising, his visual flair has transferred to the silver screen and can be seen throughout the film, with repeated use of slow motion and a black and white pallet for flashback scenes. Considering History's subject matter, I felt the film was sometimes stylish to a fault, particularly during a racial territorial dispute on a basketball court that's constructed in a way through aesthetics and music that inclines the viewer to support the white men.<br/><br/>Other examples of ill-judgement were during its humorous moments concerning the obesely corpulent and repellent Seth (Ethan Suplee), particularly during a brutal assault on immigrant supermarket staff where he steals a large plastic burger, it's not funny and is inappropriate in its placing.<br/><br/>Although its morality tale is heavy handed and simplistic, I must reiterate that American History X is a highly memorable film driven by an incendiary Edward Norton and an unrestrained, vicious intensity that few contemporary films strive for.<br/><br/>83% <br/><br/>www.hawkensian.com"

","I'll never forget the first time I watched this movie. It was with an ex-boyfriend and until he got me to watch it I'd never even heard of it. But I can honestly say that I am so glad that I did cause it's one of my favorite movies now. I love everything about it. I guess I'm different but the part were Derek makes the guy bite the curb is a part I like....not because of anyone's color just because he is protecting what is his. But I also love the fact that it shows that anyone can change themselves into being a better person, with a more open and loving heart. I hate the fact that the family is almost torn apart and that the little brother dies. For me the ending could or would have been better if both brothers had been able to change and lived a happy, loving life. But all in all I love it."

","There is no disputing that this movie is heavy-set on trying to unravel a message that both very provocative and also very powerful. The ever painful subject of racism whether it's educated or from the street, philosophical from the words of Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton), this movie will surely leave you with many thoughts popping through your mind once this movie is over.<br/><br/>""American History X"" is a without a doubt one of the most important movies that was released in the late 1990's. Once the smoke is cleared and everyone leaves the theatre, people will look back on it whether they liked the movie or they hated it, there is no doubt that Norton's performance will surely be further discussed. To me he was already a star when he was in ""Primal Fear"" and sadly was robbed of an Oscar in that performance. The amazing versatility never ceases to amaze me the way Norton's went through to portray at one hand, a scary, fearsome Nazi skinhead complete with ripped muscles, a bald head, with a swastika branded on his heart, and yet behind his menacing appearance lies a saddened, confused lonely soul who's personal mission was to rectify from his erroneous ways. He is described as a very bright young man with bad intentions and hatred bottled up inside of him from the things he learned from his ethnic-hating late father and his constant struggle to find the real meaning of life.<br/><br/>Eternally grief-stricken from a disjointed family, Derek's father's death lured Derek into the realms of Nazism it is quite original that the setting of this movie does not emanate from the South, but rather Venice Beach as a backdrop where hate crimes are quite frequent and rallies to play as Derek serves as the orator for these rallies to promote white supremacy.<br/><br/>The turning point of the movie comes when two African-Americans try to steal Derek's car. Derek clad in only his underwear chases the men with a gun and mercilessly kills them both. Sure the scene was cold and graphic and not for the weak at heart, but when the police arrive, Derek is just standing there with a cold and evil grimace on his face, complete with a haunting musical score in the background. As this scene is happening, Derek is seen staring at his young brother Danny (Edward Furlong) who was a witness to the whole incident. Danny looks on at his brother who shows absolute no remorse for his actions, standing like a proud soldier who dished out justice his way. These brutal scenes are some of the most astounding scenes you will ever find on film. These scenes alone sells this movie successfully which is more I can say for the other very rushed and not very to the point scenes. Derek's prison time could have covered more ground, but this movie tried to cover too much details with very limited time.<br/><br/>Excellent direction by Tony Kaye to highlight the past in black and white and color for the present events after Derek's discharge from prison. The execution is handled simplistic but brilliant as Derek finally home takes a hot shower for the first time in while, looks at himself and the branded swastika situated at his heart. His newly discovered shame his brought him to the point of rethinking all the bad things he's done as he covers the symbol of hate in his heart. Deep inside his heart, he looks back with regret and sorrow and rediscovery to find out what he could have done and what he can do to move forward in this new path of life he sets for himself. In spite of the often rushed script and some details that were left behind, ""American History X"" is a powerful film that must be seen first before it can be judged."
"StoryCharts","9","1","3","14 August 2013"," Prejudice and bigotry will kill our children
","American History X is about the idea that prejudice and bigotry will kill our children. The idea is that prejudice is a slippery slope. A father's offhanded racist remark over the dinner can lead to unintended consequences. The result, in the world of this movie, is children killing each other. The movie makes a pretty convincing argument that the consequences in our world would be just as dire, that there is no room for even a little bit of bigotry in our society if we are to survive without killing each other.<br/><br/>American History X goes about proving this idea with two main plots: the internal plot of Derek's redemption from being a skinhead Nazi to a tolerant individual actively helping the good cause and the external plot of Derek's attempt to save his younger brother Danny from the brainwashing that ruined him. Derek is successful in redeeming himself, but his attempt to save Danny fails when Danny is shot and killed. This suggests that even if we live with hate in a momentary weakness, that hate will have consequences far beyond the moment. The movie suggests that with hate, there is no such thing as true redemption. Therefore, we are all well-advised to avoid even a little bit of it.<br/><br/>The movie makes the idea fully believable because of the depths of hate and true redemption Derek goes through. He seemed to have finally won the battle to save both his family's soul when his past all of a sudden catches up to him and kills Danny. This twist at the end makes it impossible to finish the movie feeling good about ourselves that the hero has won his redemption through his trials by fire. It makes it impossible not to think and feel and believe that hate will eventually catch up to all of us if we let it in for even a little bit. Great idea and a great movie.<br/><br/>My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca."

Nobody gets out completely unscathed in this film. Not the white people, not the black people, not the correctional system (Norton's character kills two people and he gets out in three years), and certainly not the viewer.

","If you are expecting a movie with testosterone and gang fights just for pure fun and entertainment, you chose the wrong movie. If you came to see a drama with a powerful story with a deep and powerful message that will leave anyone who watch wet in tears by the end, then you chose the right film.<br/><br/>""American History X"" is a drama with a story full of violence and a deep message against society. Everything starts with Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) who after the death of his father by a black man, forms a Nazi-Racist gang called ""skinhead"" and with it the attempt to exterminate and expel all blacks and immigrants in their neighborhood by invading properties and get in conflict with other gangs. One day his house is assaulted by a member of a rival gang, which ends up in a double murder and with the arrest of Derek. 3 years pass and now Derek totally changed, is trying to clear his family name and try to ward off his brother Danny Vinyard (Edward Furlong) from the life of crime and racism that himself led into.<br/><br/>The film has a very interesting direction by Tony Kaye, filmed in a dramatic and disturbing way. The film is divided into two parts; one in present with Derek coming out of prison and Danny getting closer to the gang; the other part telling Derek's past and how he came from a violent racist to the repentant man haunted by his past. Both parties superbly filmed with shades of different colors. In the present with normal and colorful shot, in the past with black-and-white shots.<br/><br/>Not only the direction is superb as well as the writing of David McKenna delivering to the film disturbing and racist dialogs. At first it may seem that the film is in favor of racism and extermination of races. But throughout the film we noticed that they all try to show how stupid and inappropriate is racism and the prejudice that it can bring to those who practice it. All events on file show that more and more, and also the characters that built up the movie, mainly the professor Bob Sweeney (the old professor of Derek and the new from David) and Derek's ""friend"" in prison. Both of them through the movie show to Derek that all of us are equals.<br/><br/>But the message to be delivered perfectly it needed superb performances to complete everything and leave everything fantastic. Thanks to both Edwards this is not missed: Furlog proves to be a great dramatic actor, and Norton proves to be one of the best actors of his generation with a FANTASTIC performance that improves with every passing minute.<br/><br/>A film with a deep story; superbly written and with a final message that can make the toughest of men shed a tear thanks to fantastic performances and flawless direction. ""American History X"" is a film to be seen and be remembered by many."

","It took me a long time to watch this film, the nature of racism and bigotry is nothing new to anyone, its all around us and sadly will always be there, whether its against Black people, white people or any other ace, its unavoidable. What this film does is amazing, it takes you through one man's journey from a young man, whose outlook on life is like any other at a young age, to someone whose hate is fueled by the unfortunate death of a loved onto him trying to save another loved one to a similar fate. Each and every performance is significant, from the small, but effective roles portrayed by Fairuza Balk and Ethan Suplee, as members of the DOS that Norton's character at the start of the film has brought together, as kind of a new age Nazi regime. The two performances in the film to really look at here goes to Norton and Furlong themselves, the characters are both shown to be bright individuals despite their obvious ignorance and as we get to know them, we begin to really want them to succeed in a turn around. Of course, with Norton's character we see him already changed, trying to put the pieces of his family back together, due to his actions in the past and its through flashbacks we get to see his turnaround. Another performance that should thrown out there is by Guy Torry, who plays Norton's cell mate of sorts(they don't share a cell, but they have the same work duty), his character is likable and he manages to make you feel like your there in the film helping him to turn Norton around. The main focus of the movie starts out with Furlong's character on the verge of becoming the hateful clone that his brother was locked up for going too far with, while we see him as a caring member of the family, its hard to see his ignorance come out, simply due to skin color and feeling that society is now so focused on being equal they are screwing over the white race, which as a white person living in the projects, I can relate(although, I don't grow any hate over it). Edward Furlong does a phenomenal job in this film, although, they look nothing alike, you really feel they were brothers with a tight bond. Another aspect of the film that really sends a great message is how the story the told in present time, with the flashbacks being told in black & white, it keeps the film feeling surreal, while still giving you the message the scene is trying to get out, with the most effective scene coming in the form of what ultimately got Norton landed in jail and what Furlong is thinking of when he finally has his turnaround. Although, I put in that there are spoilers in this review, I think its best you watch this film to see how the ending plays out, its an unexpected and very non-cliché. One that will have you watching through the credits as you wrap your mind around what you just watched. 5 out of 5 stars I will also have to note that this film has never gotten a decent DVD release, no commentary, no featurettes, nothing. The studio needs to wake up and give us something like that."
"caliorange33","10","1","3","6 May 2013"," Excellent Movie
","American History X is one of the best films that I have seen in my lifetime. If I could, I would make it a mandatory viewing for every single individual. The moral lesson alone makes it a must see for everyone, especially those who are conflicted and caving to peer pressure; regardless of age. Throughout each of our lives we come to a cross roads at least once or twice where we have the opportunity to make a choice to let hatred consume us or to fight the urge for hatred to enter our hearts and our souls. This movie shows us how misdirected hatred can ruin lives, directly and indirectly. The film crew did a fantastic job collaborating to create a film that not only entertains, but one that makes the viewer think twice about the life they have lived and the impact they have had on the ones they love. I feel that all of the actors played their parts perfectly, but extra kudos goes to the core actors/characters: Edward Norton as Derek Vinyard and Edward Furlong as Danny Vinyard. These characters are played so well that you almost don't have a choice but to be pulled into the intensity of their lives. My favorite effects used in the movie, to my surprise, are the transitions from color images to black and white images. These transitions, in addition to the random and perfectly placed slow motion effects, enhance the emotional aspect of the film. As the story bounces around from present day/post incarceration and past/pre incarceration, it is easy to keep up with the storyline with the transition from color to black and white. I was surprised that I would like this aspect of the film, since I am not normally a big fan of black and white footage. The black and white images help the viewer to focus more on the emotions that need to be felt by the characters and the setting. On the surface, the film is about a reformed neo-nazi skinhead who, after being released from prison, tries to reverse the destruction he has created within his family – only to realize he is too late. Below the surface; however, is a much needed lesson that hatred of any kind will only destroy you and the people close to you. Regardless of what you believe when you allow anger to consume you, there is no good found in hatred. If you are looking for a fluffy film, this is definitely not the film for you. If you are looking to learn a much needed lesson about our culture and the world we live in, this is a must see."

","I want to start this review off by addressing a common point that negative reviews about this movie TRIED to make. Many say ""why are the black characters so unlikeable""...and ""why are the white characters actions so forgivable, etc etc."" Did you people even WATCH the movie? Seriously, did we go to the fridge for refreshments during all the parts containing the black guy Norton does laundry with in prison? Or how about all the parts containing the ""Doctor"" (the principal of the high school)? Did we ignore those parts? Maybe i'm mistaken, but they seemed like pretty likable characters to me. The rest of the black characters SERVE THEIR PURPOSE. Most of them are gang-members, you're not SUPPOSED to like them. And how about half of the ""skinheads""? Seemed like pretty UNlikeable characters to me. A lot of them also seemed to perform some actions that weren't all that forgivable to me.<br/><br/>Anyway, GREAT movie.

"moviesleuth2","10","1","3","12 July 2008"," Wow
","When the credits started rolling after the film ""American History X,"" the one word, the one feeling that I felt was: Wow. This is an amazing, powerful film.<br/><br/>One could quickly classify this as a film that deals with racism, but that is a misconception. ""American History X"" is about hate, and one man's journey from having it rule his life to realizing how pointless it is.<br/><br/>Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) was the poster-boy for a white supremacist gang in California. Things changed after he was sent to prison for murder, and now he's trying to prevent his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) from going down the same path.<br/><br/>""American History X"" is like the ultimate persuasive speech, both in what it achieves and how it's constructed. This powerful film tackles a complex and relevant subject head-on. But its construction as a piece of skilled rhetoric is genius. There's the set-up, addressing of both sides of the issue, then finally the explanation of the point that it wants to make. Director Tony Kaye deftly handles the material so that the subject matter, rather than directorial flair, is what hammers in the point. And he uses enough subtlety to make ""American History X"" seem more like a film than a piece of rhetoric.<br/><br/>What makes this film work so well is that it seeks to UNDERSTAND both sides of the issue. It doesn't humanize people who hate, and it certainly doesn't expect the audience to sympathize with them, but it explains why they hate. This makes for a more compelling argument because it allows for a more finely-tuned rebuttal. The fact that the skinheads, at least Derek Vinyard, are allowed to sound intelligent, gives a fresh look on an argument that if done any other way would give this film a ""been there, done that"" kind of feel.<br/><br/>Additionally, it gives insight into the sources of hate and how people like the skinheads become the frontrunners of such feelings. It offers a number of origins and introduces them in a number of ways.<br/><br/>This film wouldn't be as compelling and powerful had it not been for a cast filled with superior performances. Edward Norton received an Oscar nod for this role, and he earned it. This is easily his best performance. His character has a wide, dramatic arc and Norton never loses sight of the character. Edward Furlong is impressive as Danny. Furlong has been almost off the map since his star-making debut opposite Arnold Schwartzenegger and Linda Hamilton in ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day."" Here he makes it clear that he hasn't grown out of his acting ability. Beverly D'Angelo shows that she can act off of someone other than Chevy Chase (and in a hard-hitting drama, no less). Stacy Keach is suitably creepy and vile as Cameron, the man who helped Derek with his rise to ""god"" status amongst the skinheads, but Keach wisely never goes over the top. Elliot Gould, Fairuza Balk and Ethan Suplee (in an unexpectedly fine performance) are all in good form here.<br/><br/>The one person who gets no praise but deserves much is Avery Brooks. He's brilliant and at times equal to Norton. He fills the mentor role, but he knows this is not supposed to be a gentle performance a la Robin Williams in ""Dead Poet's Society"" (no ill-will towards Williams' role in that film); he's gritty and forceful and he fits right in. It's a shame that he didn't get an Oscar nod for his performance.<br/><br/>According to IMDb, director Tony Kaye claimed that Edward Norton altered the film so much to give himself an Oscar nod for his performance that Kaye wanted his name to be replaced by ""Humpty Dumpty."" He filed a $275 million lawsuit against the Director's Guild and New Line Cinema when he wasn't allowed to remove his name. Be that as it may, at least the result was not the disaster that usually happens to a film that suffers from too much interference from someone OTHER than the director. It's hard to imagine this film being any better. Still, it would be interesting to see the director's cut of the film (the deleted scenes aren't much help in guessing what Kaye's original vision was, as they're mostly the sort of throwaway scenes that had a reason for being left on the cutting room floor).<br/><br/>While I respect Kaye's decision for wanting his name removed, having been left with his name on the film is not exactly a bad thing. In fact, his work is amazing. The scenes from Derek's past are shown in black and white (no hint of film noir-style from the oldie films), and the scenes from the present are shown in color. Kaye acted as his own cinematographer, and his skill in both positions is evident.<br/><br/>Insightful, provocative, and undeniably powerful, ""American History X"" is a brilliant film, and one that needs to be seen."

I don't think any person of the stature and age for that role at the time could have done better than he did. This movie showed so well the real life issue of hate towards each other. Blacks hate for whites. Whites hate for blacks through very really movements like the Neo-Nazi movement.

","American History X pokes at the belief of white supremacists and political correctness in America. Tony Kaye punches you in the face with his fierce dialogue and cinematography, supported by a masterful performance by Edward Norton, the reformed and remorseful Neo-Nazi protégé. It reinforces the current standing that clever racists can profoundly exploit those that have no direction in life and nowhere to channel their anger. Even with its verbal and physical brutality, it is a film that should be watched to see these extreme issues and how things could end up if we let poverty, racism and political correctness feed of each other. It is shame that Tony Kaye has not directed many other films.<br/><br/>Edward Norton is a talented actor as he possesses an ability to morph into many different characters (The Narrator, Fight Club) (Monty Brogan, 25th Hour) (Eisenheim, The Illusionist), providing he has the artistic room to breathe. Tony Kaye utilisation of Norton's flexibility has made this one of 1998's poignant yet underrated films.<br/><br/>There were a few scenes in the film that gave the impression of the unnecessary purity of racist violence. Triumphant music scores as the white supremacist battle with their darker counterparts and almost 'Jesus-like' holiness during Derek's revengeful murders were overcooked. Although the sole piece of the film revolves around Derek, his actions and consequences, it doesn't explain his family's staunch views against Racism. With all the family difficulties, financially and spiritually, the film does not explain their moral convictions and the importance of education as shown by Derek's sister's devotion to education. There was also the over simplification of why Derek was going to be dormant racist in the making due to his father views. It would have nice to see a little bit more of Murray (Elliot Gould) and Sweeney (Avery Brooks) interact with Derek and how there lives were affected by his persona. Finally, the deleted scenes should have been added to the film as I felt added weight and understanding.<br/><br/>Even though this film is several year old as I write this, it is still provoking today as it was in 1998.

","This is a very effective movie, which for me is gauged by how many times my stomach turned during this film. Edward Norton gives the performance of a lifetime, and was deservedly nominated for an Oscar.<br/><br/>The topic of race relations in America is a touchy subject, and this film thankfully didn't portray one side--i.e. the whites--as being the problem. There are many black ""leaders"" who fallaciously allege that blacks cannot be racist because they haven't any power. This allegation is ridiculous: the fact that Tawana Brawley was never prosecuted for her fiasco is an excellent example of which side has the power. The worst thing that you can be labeled these days? A Communist--no. A Fascist--no. The worst thing you can be labeled these days is a ""racist."" That's why many whites are reluctant to speak on race relations, it's the 3rd rail of politics.<br/><br/>No one probably wants to admit it, but Norton's character makes a lot of sense when discussing the illegal immigration problem and the Rodney King debacle. I had heard a stat from the FBI not too long ago that was eye-opening: that black men, who are 6% of the American population, commit 45% of the violent crimes in this country--that's unbelievable!! Further, you have people that practically swim to this country from Asia, learn the language, and still outperform blacks in school, and yet all we hear are excuses from the black ""leaders."" The vision of a Southern governor of the 50's standing outside a school to prevent black children from entering is a distant memory. Now you have schools practically begging black students to apply to college, despite their poor qualifications, in order to promote ""diversity"" while Asian kids, for example, work their butts off and get cheated as colleges admit the less qualified applicants. So much for fairness and the American dream. And yet, these policies by liberal do-gooders promote more friction among ethnic groups. Unfortunately, however, a white man like myself is not supposed to brooch these issues--for only someone like Bill Cosby can, and he has, to his credit. <br/><br/>Despite my rants above, I don't believe in the radicalism of these white supremacist groups. This nation would undoubtedly be more harmonious if there were no more ""protected minorities"" and that all quota systems would cease. People should advance based on merit, not by skin color. After all, isn't that what Martin Luther King Jr said?"

","Definitely one of a few movies that makes me cry: As the protagonists are fascist brothers, you will surely consider me either as a fascist too, either as a stupid man. The truth is that I care a lot for my twin brother, which is also, above all, the exact quality and strength of this movie.<br/><br/>If it lifts the veil behind the American Dream, it is by focusing about a ""pissed off"" family. The expression is maybe crude (but told) and it means that they face confusion and fragility. <br/><br/>If they live in Venice Beach, it isn't ""Baywatch"" anymore, but violence, guns, gangs. After a death in the family, the brother feels the duty to be in charge and realizes that if a better life comes with fights, the fight against colored people isn't the right one ! <br/><br/>Watching (again) this movie now is a perfect timing because what the fascist told there are the same issues that arise in my country for the presidential election. That's frightening because in the movie, those speech are supported with swastikas, shaved heads, while in France, it is told by white collars in suit !!!! <br/><br/>But reducing this movie to racial hate would be an error because it offers great insight about the confusing aspect of ""real life"": The big brother is as much physically powerful than he is full of doubts. The more he gets into morals value, the more he gets problems. So, as for every one, the challenge would be: ""What is the most important: a simple life or a moral life ?"". The little brother, as every little brother (like me) belongs to the ghost universe and he only exists in the light of his big brother. ""When people look at me, they see my brother"". I couldn't have said better! <br/><br/>My final appreciation would be for the talented cast (all the family, prof Sweeney, the courageous Stacy ""Mike Hammer"" Keach) and the director Tony Kayes, who blends the intense material in a artistic & very moving way!<br/><br/>And all this to get only one Oscar nomination for best actor (Edward Norton), my motto would be appropriate: ""I don't understand !!!!!!"""

The movie almost had me in tears by the end of it. If you aren't moved after watching this movie then you just aren't human.<br/><br/>Derek Vinyard (Ed Norton) is one of the most dynamic characters I have ever seen in a movie. I mean he is so impressionable but yet so charismatic at the same time. Very rarely do get that kind of dangerous combination together. He was so gullible and would believe what any strong willed person forced upon him, but the dangerous part is that he take what he learned and influence so many people with it. He had that special something that people were just drawn to. He could make people do whatever he wanted them to do, but in the same turn would do whatever someone else wanted him to do. His transformation by the end of this movie was just so inspiring. This is one of the best characters I have seen in a long long time.<br/><br/>If you have not seen this movie yet, you do not know what you are missing. I'm not going to lie to you though; this movie is not for everyone. American History X will show you a side of the real world that no one really wants to know about. So if you want to stay in your perfect little bubble that there is nothing wrong in the world then DO NOT watch this movie. This movie tackles the race issues in our society in a way that most people would be afraid to touch. By the end of this movie you will be almost ready to cry because it shows you everything that is wrong with society today, but there is that silver lining of hope that everyone can change.

","Edward Norton shines in his role of Derek Vinyard in AHX, which is the bluntest, most realistic portrayal of racism in the world that Hollywood has ever produced. The movie is one of an evolution in philosophy, of courage and standing up for what is right. Unfortunately, some who see this film come out of it with the impression that it contradicts itself.<br/><br/>*Spoilers* In the end, when Danny is shot by the black student who he confronted in the opening scene, some people seem to believe that it gives the impression that it makes a villain out of the black student and destroys the lesson the film tries to preach. However what some fail to realize is that the film is about racism, spoken from a white person's perspective, however racism is a problem within all societies and within all races, and as a result everybody loses. Danny lived a life of hatred and lost his life as a result, and his killer, fueled by the same hate, is obviously going to live the majority of his life behind bars as a result. The movie may be about redemption, however the message serves as a warning and tries to keep the audience from living a life similar to the Vinyard brothers before you go too far.<br/><br/>All in all, one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. AHX gets a 9.5/10 from me."

I was so into his propaganda that I suddenly realized that I am racist.And I believe that there are a lot of people out there, just like me, that would do exactly what Danny and the other skinheads were doing if they had someone like Derek in front of them. That's what I loved about the movie: it provided us with an accurate insight on racism and its effects. Unfortunately it didn't focus enough on the reasons for the changes in Derek's attitude and didn't help me reach the other side, leaving me in the racists's side. They should have worked more on the script, shown more of Derek's life in prison.I was kinda disappointed... but, overall, a great movie"
"squeezebox","7","1","3","19 April 2005"," Would be a great movie if not for the awful ending
","American HISTORY X is, in general, an excellent movie. The screenplay, performances and direction are all first rate. Unfortunately, the movie jumps its track in its final moments, with an ending that, when one thinks about it, negates the entire movie! SPOILER ALERT!!! The moment I saw Edward Furlong appear on screen, I knew he would be dead by the end of the movie. I knew this movie couldn't possibly have a happy ending, or even a remotely uplifting one. I also figured out that the young black kid with whom Furlong had a run-in would be the one to kill him.<br/><br/>My problem is, what's the point of the movie with this ending? I thought the movie was about redemption and enlightenment. But it seems to me that the message of the movie is that redemption and enlightenment are either impossible or useless. By the time you realize the error of your ways, it will undoubtedly be too late.<br/><br/>Also, the fact that Furlong is killed by a black kid whom he attempted to intimidate doesn't sit well with me. What are the filmmakers saying? Racism will turn a white kid into an angry delinquent, but will turn a black kid into a murderer? That's a real positive message to get people to question the stereotype of all young black men as gun wielding gang members.<br/><br/>I'll praise this movie with a 7 out of 10, because I think the bulk of the movie is excellent. But the handling of the ending is sloppy, lazy and, yes, racist storytelling. I agree Edward Norton's character had to pay for his sins, but the way in which they have it happen practically affirms his Neo-Nazi beliefs.<br/><br/>I have a feeling that's NOT the message the filmmakers wanted to convey."

","""American History X""<br/><br/>Aspect ratio: 1.85:1<br/><br/>Sound formats: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDS<br/><br/>(Color & black and white)<br/><br/>An angry young white supremacist (Edward Norton) is reformed whilst in prison for killing two black men, and struggles to prevent his younger brother (Edward Furlong) from travelling down the same desperate path.<br/><br/>Scorching drama, elevated by Norton's intense performance as the frustrated rebel whose intelligence is twisted by circumstances into an all-consuming hatred of minorities, until his eyes are finally opened to the realities of such manufactured racism. Commercials/music video director Tony Kaye made his feature debut here, though the project was taken out of his hands by studio bosses and 'completed' by Norton following a lengthy editing process, prompting Kaye to reject the finished product (he was refused permission to credit himself as 'Humpty Dumpty'). David McKenna's script describes the ways in which Nazi ideology is propagated by strong-minded individuals who impose their influence on the young and vulnerable (Stacy Keach plays the head of Norton's local skinhead chapter, who co-ordinates episodes of violent 'activism' from a safe legal distance), and how it manifests itself amongst those without an appropriate outlet for their aggressive tendencies.<br/><br/>The film kicks into high gear from the outset, when the full extent of Norton's racism becomes apparent during a horrific confrontation with his widowed mom's new boyfriend (Elliott Gould), followed by a gut-wrenching scene in which Norton commits the sickening crime that will send him to prison and change his life forever. There, his worldview is profoundly challenged not only by his friendship with African-American co-worker Guy Torry (terrific in a pivotal role), but also by the double standards employed amongst the skinhead gangs he encounters within the prison system. For these characters, there can be no happy ending, and the film builds to a shattering finale. Also starring Beverly D'Angelo, Avery Brooks, William Russ and an unrecognizable Fairuza Balk. Fine technical credits."

","There are 1000 reviews of this film - I'll try to make it short:<br/><br/>**SPOLERS***<br/><br/>The acting is good (especially E Norton), the story moves quickly and is very entertaining. <br/><br/>As far as realism, I don't know about how neo-nazi gangs function...so I can't comment on that aspect. I can say this - when Norton gets back from jail and his ex-girlfriend is ""all over him""...then 2 minutes later is shouting ""kill him"" (after she learns he is no longer interested in the neo-nazi cause) is absolutely absurd. I don't care how brainwashed she is, noone can swing their feeling like that - from ""I love you"" to I want your head blown off. Come on! <br/><br/>Also, it seemed to me that Norton's transformation was more due to thinking that the neo-Nazis/skins were all full of crap and involved in the ""cause"" for alterior motives (power, selling drugs, etc) - as opposed to thinking well, maybe blacks, hispanics, Jews, etc aren't so bad. He met one black guy who was friendly to him - and everything changed? <br/><br/>I could go on, but it's worth seeing - I don't want to push the negatives so much - it's definitely an interesting film..."

","I first watched this film a few years ago, but only got about fifty minutes in (after the bit where the hero/antihero crushes the black guy's skull on the kerb) because I had taped it off the TV and the video tape ran out. I thought it looked like a pretty decent movie, but could wait until it was on the TV again.<br/><br/>I finally got to borrow the complete video a few weeks back and saw the rest of the movie and, unfortunately, I wasn't impressed.<br/><br/>This is a film that's got its head stuck so far up its backside that it completely misses the point. The message I took away was: ""If you're a neo-Nazi then you're either going to be: a) buttf**ked by another, bigger, neo-Nazi, or b) shot by a black guy. So don't be a neo-Nazi.""<br/><br/>This is crap! I bet plenty of narrow-minded white supremacist types are having a pretty good time. The real issue is how this kind of behaviour affects ethnics - an aspect of hate crime that this film totally fails to explore, except during the ""sweetener"" parts of the film - latino woman in the shop being physically abused by the Nazi thugs, the mouth-on-the-kerb thing, etc. These despicable scenes - presumably why all the closet racists out there rave about this film - are totally unnecessary, and if you have to have them at all, why not explore the effects of this violence on the victims?<br/><br/>The ""revelatory"" bit at the end, with the late father talking about ""n!gger bullsh!t"", didn't make sense to me. The guy makes one comment over the dinner table and so his son - years later - decides to become a Nazi?<br/><br/>Or was it supposed to suggest that the family were regularly getting this kind of crap from the head of the household, in which case perhaps it would have been a better film to have shown a racist dad bringing up a family and turning his children into a bunch of f**k-ups!<br/><br/>This film does nothing to improve race relations. Its message is clearly ""don't be a racist for your own sake"", which clearly appeals to many self-centred people who were brought up during the look-out-for-yourself Reagan-Thatcher years.<br/><br/>Nicely shot, yes. Good acting, yes. But a terrible script delivering the wrong message!"
"SnobbyDude","6","1","3","28 March 2003"," Something didn't quite click....
","I'm all over the place in evaluating this movie because the movie is a mess also. It's got a lot of good qualities and just as many bad ones.<br/><br/>When you read the reviews of this movie, many people get the feel that it is a technical mess. I agree, that it was a technical mess too. I did enjoy it overall, but I didn't find it as enjoyable as it should have been. I have been thinking about this for a few days now since I have seen it. What was missing? I think it tries to bite off more than it can chew and that is its biggest weakness. It is a powerfully emotional film, but, sadly, this level of emotion is lost in attempting to clean up any loose ends or unanswered questions. The film is considerably bogged down by trying to solve a lot issues and emotion is lost. The focus of the entire story is shifted. Then we wind up with a complicated mess of answers, which, for me, raised more questions, because I wasn't sure I was satisfied with the answers/solutions I was given. <br/><br/>It is a good film with great performances, especially by Norton. This is usually the kind of movie I don't enjoy watching because I'm not usually big on films and filmmakers that have an ax to grind. I like to watch movies for entertainment, not to feel like I'm being taught/lectured to. <br/><br/>Do I sound like I am having a hard time making up my mind about this movie?<br/><br/>I am!<br/><br/>I liked it, but I can't put it on my list of top movies because it was too predictable and not very believable. I predicted the ending in the about 10 minutes before it happened and knew what was going to happen in the flashbacks every step of the way. <br/><br/>Another thing I was wondering about was realism....I don't live in CA, and have never been to the bad areas, but is it possible that black gang-members would ever play basketball in Venice (I think it was Venice) with Neo Nazi's? I didn't think that scene was realistic. Also, the movie makes it sound like Neo Nazis are a real threat to society, but how many skinheads are there? I've never met one before, let alone seen one... <br/><br/>I think, these days, people think being unbiased and objective means looking at 2 groups of people and being equally harsh in judging both of them. Maybe I've lived a sheltered life, but I think in attempting to try to be ""fair"", the movie makes with people out to be a much bigger threat to society than they are. Is there anyone in the USA that is afraid to go out at night because of Neo-Nazis? I think, in attempting to be be unbiased, the movie discredits itself and becomes unrealistic. This is a shame, but the bottom line is that this is a VERY complicated subject matter. I doubt anyone could really make a film of this nature without making lots of missteps.<br/><br/>Rather than trying to find a solution, they should have let the audience decide what to think. I got annoyed when I was spoon fed the ""hate is baggage line."" Let me figure it out on my own! The best movies are the ones that make you think, not the ones that try to think for you."
"DonShin","6","1","3","6 February 2003"," a movie like this needs to be made, but...
","... really not in such a shabby fashion.  Tony Kaye's direction leaves much to be desired, and the musical decisions within the film make you feel like you're watching The Last of the Mohicans, and not a contemporary film about race.  Derek Vinyard's transformation from skinhead to savior is admirable, but even this main character's development is done poorly, as are the other roles.  The plot (though somewhat lacking in sophistication) is engaging enough, yet Edward Norton's superb acting alone saves this piece from being completely unwatchable -- further convincing this viewer how much better this movie would have been under different direction.  I'm sad to conclude that this is yet another movie highly undeserving of its lofty ranking. 6/10."

Don't get me wrong - it's OK - infact it's a good attempt at a serious docu-drama by Hollywood - it's just that Europe does this sort of thing much better. And the UK (esp. the BBC and C4) has made much better films on neo-Nazis. The film is also a little sentimental and hard to swallow in parts (the rapid transformation of the brother from normal boy to Nazi back to normal boy again was hard to believe). On the positive side, Edward Norton is excellent and the movie is never boring. Maybe I'm spoiled having seen Norton in 'Fight Club' recently. Now that *was* a great movie..."

","American History X is not only an immaculately made tale of redemption and loss, excellently anchored by an Oscar worthy performance from Edward Norton, it is also vitally important to understanding the problems that still lie in America today. This film deals with the naivety of racism in America, and how young kids, like Edward Furlong's character Danny Vinyard, can be drawn into a life of hate without even realising what they're hating in the first place. Contrasting two periods of Derek Vinyard's (Norton) life, American History X shows the despair and anger that are bred from ignorant hate but also the enlightenment that is found when the hate is lost and the anger drains away. The pulsating rage of Vinyard's character as he lashes out at his mother's partner is painstakingly juxtaposed against his feelings of sorrowful regret, as he attempts to save his brother from making the same mistakes he did. The film's climax is almost Shakespearian in its poignancy, and it will leave you thinking for days. A masterpiece."

","In the film American History X, Edward Norton plays Derek Vinyard, who after some influence by his father's words, and later anger from his father's murder by a black man, becomes a neo-Nazi and joins a local Nazi gang. Derek, who heavily influences his younger brother Danny, played by Edward Furlong, is informed one night by Danny that two black men are breaking into his truck outside. Derek then grabs his gun, runs outside, and proceeds to gun down the men. He then finishes off one of the would-be robbers by smashing his head on the curb. Soon after, he is arrested and convicted of manslaughter, and avoiding a murder charge because his younger brother refuses to testify against him.<br/><br/>Derek undergoes a radical transformation in prison, as he realizes that much of the racism and hatred he has been taught to display by others is really only superficial, and really deep down inside, there is no real reason for such malice. This helps show the theme of the movie, racism and hatred are learned traits, not born into a person. <br/><br/>After enduring a violent rape in prison, and befriending a fellow black inmate, Derek has a change of heart, and realizes the foolishness of his ways, and the ignorance of hate and racism. He realizes that the most important thing in life is family, and not hatred for people unlike him. After his release from prison, Derek forsakes his old friends including his old buddy Seth, played by Ethan Suplee, and even his girlfriend Stacy, played by Fairuza Balk, as he attempts to distance himself from the neo-Nazi movement. <br/><br/>The movie draws to a conclusion as Danny comes face to face with a boy whom he had a confrontation with days before, in the bathroom of his school on the day he is scheduled to submit his paper, American History X. The boy pulls out a pistol and shoots Danny in the chest and kills him. Derek learns of his younger brother's murder and becomes terribly distraught. The film ends with Danny's words from his paper, quoting President Abraham Lincoln. <br/><br/>This film helps the viewer understand that hatred and racism is not something that is born in someone, as Derek and Danny were not shown to display these characteristics as children, but learned to hate as they got older by influences around them. This is a similar situation to Walt Kowalski role, played by Clint Eastwood, in the movie Gran Torino, as he witnessed the exodus of white, middle-class people from his neighborhood, and the influx of minorities. <br/><br/>American History X uses a reoccurring motif to make the viewer aware of the racist hatred bred in the boys by those around them. We constantly see Nazi propaganda, along with swastikas, etc. Also, the dialogue in the film and the use of constant racial slurs reinforced the hatred in these young men's hearts. <br/><br/>It is clear that racism and hatred are not traits that are born in individuals, but rather created in the hearts of impressionable people by those wishing to spread their prejudiced views to others. The theme of this movie helps us understand that a good way to keep these feelings from those we love is to try not to influence, or let them be influenced by this kind of animosity."

","Without a doubt Edward Norton's best role, never to be surpassed. The same nearly goes for Edward Furlong, but I'm still contemplating on that one. Nonetheless, both will never be forgotten as roles of nightmarish realism. A reality that some believe to have died off with the rallies and marches in the 60s. But it is alive and well, even in the hearts of some of today's unfortunately misguided youth. The story, as it progresses, expresses one fundamental idea. Ones does not simply wake up and accept the fact that there a fired up racist. It is a seed that starts out small, and is nurtured by those who do not know how to lead, or have their lost their own way. And then, at a certain point, it is fed like a fire needing fuel. But just like a flame, it can always be extinguished. Lots of symbolic stuff, huh? Well, one picks up these things after watching the film several times. Racism is not an inherited fundamental theory. It is a learned trait. The film's director Tony Kane and writer David McKenna worked hard to deliver this theme. As far as I've read at first there was a much more edited and toned down version to be originally released. But thank God that didn't happen. I also give praise to Anne Dudley's score, pure emotion if you ask me. An A+ plus no less."

","This is the only thing by Kaye I've seen(and the only I'd really heard of), but everything else by him looks compelling. When dealing with something controversial and brutal, you can water it down and appease censors, or you can match it in how relentless it is. In the case of a flawed ideology, the battle can be fought mainly by letting the followers and their actions speak for themselves(this is not propaganda; what we see in this could have happened). That is what we have here. I've read that this was based on a true story; while I don't know for sure, I can imagine that it is. The editing is sharp and vicious, not playing down what we're seeing in the least. Cinematography is dynamic and it keeps the pace(and intensity) high throughout, without reaching the point where we are overwhelmed or something didn't properly register with us. It is a 110-minute dirty, bumpy ride down a bad road, with the result that we can only seek to avoid the path, and deter others from following it, as well. The acting is spellbinding, every single performance. I found myself realizing that I knew these people from other stuff(then again, why haven't I seen Guy Torry in anything else good(steer clear of The Animal)? He's great!); however, they are so convincing here that they disappear into their well-written, credible and well-developed characters. Furlong is amazing. Norton ignites the screen as the furious and charismatic Derek. Apparently, he recut this to get himself more time... I don't know, maybe he did; I have to admit, I am rather happy with the released version. The ending is perfectly underplayed, a brilliant pay-off to a subtle setup and an undeniable fact of the problem of racism and hatred(as a sort of spot-on period to a film about those subjects). All of the script is impeccable. The dialog is natural, and the unrestrained feel of it helps paint a clearer image of the types we're following. This is funny at times, and it isn't without uplifting moments(not to be confused with sap or sentimentality); there is light at the end of the tunnel, it's merely dim. The author of this does not have anything other than this to his credit(well, S.W.A.T. was decent)... don't let that fool you. There is a ton of strong language, graphic, bloody and terrifying violence and disturbing content, a little sexuality(and a rape) and male nudity, including full frontal in this, and none of it is gratuitous. The DVD comes with three deleted scenes coming to a total of six and a half minutes and a theatrical trailer. I recommend this to anyone mature enough for it, and who has the stomach for it(yes, regardless of any other parameters). 10/10"

","Perhaps the highest compliment you can pay to Edward Norton is that his Oscar-nominated performance in American History X nearly convinces you that there is a shred of logic in the tenets of white supremacy. If that statement doesn't horrify you, it should; Norton is so fully immersed in his role as a neo-Nazi skinhead that his character's eloquent defense of racism is disturbingly persuasive--at least on the surface. Looking lean and mean with a swastika tattoo and a mind full of hate, Derek Vinyard (Norton)has inherited racism from his father, and that learning has been intensified through his service to Cameron (Stacy Keach), a grown-up thug playing tyrant and teacher to a growing band of disenfranchised teens from Venice Beach, California, all hungry for an ideology that fuels their brooding alienation.<br/><br/>The film's basic message--that hate is learned and can be unlearned--is expressed through Derek's kid brother, Danny (Edward Furlong), whose sibling hero-worship increases after Derek is imprisoned (or, in Danny's mind, martyred) for the killing of two black men. Lacking Derek's gift of rebel rhetoric,Danny is easily swayed into the violent, hateful lifestyle that Derek disowns during his thoughtful time in prison. Once released,Derek struggles to save his brother from a violent fate, and American History X partially suffers from a mix of intense emotions, awkward sentiment, and predictably inevitable plotting.<br/><br/>And yet British director Tony Kaye (who would later protest against Norton's creative intervention during post-production) manages to juggle these qualities--and a compelling clash of visual styles--to considerable effect. No matter how strained their collaboration may have been, both Kaye and Norton can be proud to have created a film that addresses the issue of racism with dramatically forceful impact."

","Edward Norton was nominated for an Oscar 10 years ago in 1998 for his performance in 1998 in ""American History X."" His role as Derek Vinyard, a once-bright kid-turned-charismatic-neo-Nazi skinhead leader is one of the most brilliantly brutal and uncompromising screen performances I've ever seen. After being released from prison, he emerges reformed, determined to leave his old life behind and start fresh, and try to make amends to his broken family. As a 22-year-old black male, I was not the slightest bit offended by ""American History X"" and the violent racist rhetoric on display here. A lot of what is said and done in this film can be heard from any right-wing conservative loudmouth (i.e., Ann Coulter, Rush Limbaugh, Bill O'Reilly and Michael Savage, among many others), so many of the discussions here won't be lost on some viewers. The meat of the story gets underway when Derek's younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) writes a history paper on ""Mein Kampf"" and is on the verge of expulsion by the school's principal (Avery Brooks) as a result. The principal decides to take Danny under his wing in a remedial history course called, among other things, ""American History X."" Through Danny's work under the principal, in equal parts back-story and present-story, he explores Derek's transformation into a skinhead, after coming under the influence of a local white supremacist, Cameron Alexander (Stacy Keach), following the murder of their father (though the seeds were planted much earlier, as detailed fairly late in the film), and Derek becomes his protégé, recruiting many lost and impressionable young kids for him. Britisher Tony Kaye directed David McKenna's occasionally flawed script, which guides Norton's Derek Vinyard through a devastating and vicious cycle that is as brilliant as it is chilling and realistic. The transformation he goes through in this film, and his attempts to keep Danny from following in his footsteps is indeed one of the greatest screen performances of all time, even if some issues get left out in the cold, and the script seems deficient in the storytelling at times. But regardless, ""American History X,"" is just one damn-brilliant piece of film-making. The intensity of the performances, especially Edward Norton's, and the material show us that this is film-making at its best. One of the all-time greatest films.<br/><br/>10/10"
"insomniac_rod","10","1","4","3 February 2007"," A key and influential movie for new generations.
","Among my TOP 10 movies of all time; ""American History X"" demonstrates that cinema can deliver lessons of life. This movie, in the most and best possible Hollywood manner displays a beautiful message for humanity and at the same time, it shows the horrors of how can racism and hatred can ruin the world. <br/><br/>This movie can make you cry, make you smile, make you feel powerful, make you feel sad; it's a roller-coaster of emotions and with a strong social message. It will make you think and re-define your ideas for equity and humanity. <br/><br/>Maybe I'm praising this movie too much, but I feel that it deserves recognition for displaying a terrible disease in the history of humanity and at the same time, show that races shouldn't be a matter of distinction; the only possible way that people are different is according to their ideas and points of view. We are not different. And as the beautiful quote displayed from this movie ""We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained we must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory will swell when again touched, as surely they will be by the better angels of our nature"". You'll see who said this when watching the movie...<br/><br/>The plot is easy to follow but hard to understand as many dialogs are aggressive but intelligent. For example, Derek's hatred against black people and jews is justified in an intelligent way (OF COURSE IN HIS MIND), and he defends his ideas with strong thinking and based on actual facts. Then, the director adds his point of view when the characters say their moral and political correctness points of view. <br/><br/>The situations that Derek lives on jail are breath taking and beautify in different ways. First, he feels like he's home when he meets with Neo-Nazi prisoners ; then he makes friends with a black man who, has an important part in the story because he literally, saves Derek's life and makes him finally understand that people are equal on every aspect. But it's not as easy as that, because his younger brother, Danny is following his steps... <br/><br/>Watch this movie as a complex viewing because you will need your full attention and comprehensive abilities in order to make an objective comment about it. I'm sure that this movie is a way to display humanity and unify races.<br/><br/>The production values are perfect. The direction is raw but visually stunning. Big budget can make wonders when used correctly and this movie proves it. The score is also excellent, not to mention the perfect and inspiring cinematography. The acting is simply perfect. Edward Norton gives the performance of his life and demonstrates he's one of the most skilled actors of his generation. He's strong in all the sense of the word. The same about Edward Furlong who deserves a lot of recognition for this excellent performance. The chemistry between both actors is touching, moving. I almost cried when Derek finds his dead brother. Beverly D'Angelo also is great and convincing on her role. She's a fine dramatic actress. Avery Brooks almost stole the show with his minimal on-screen time; I want to have a teacher like him. Ethan Suplee, Satcy Keach, Fairuza Balk (sexy!), and Elliout Goul; all of them deliver great performances. They were very compromised with their roles. <br/><br/>I can't praise this movie enough, I think it's a dramatic, sad story with a special vibe and a feeling of power that will leave you satisfied but with a special feeling of sadness or power. <br/><br/>This is a unique visual experience. One of the best movies from the 90's and probably , from all time. <br/><br/>""AMERICAN HISTORY X"" deserves the best recognition and should be watched by every children on History class. <br/><br/>When I watched it for the first time, years ago, I knew it changed my life and my concept for many things."

","This definitely has to be my favorite movie. Edward Norton gives a great performance playing Dereck Vinyard, a skinhead needing to be saved. Edward Furlong also delivers a great performance playing Dereck's little brother that unfortunately follows under his footsteps. It has a great lesson and is amazing if you like controversial movies. Tony Kaye did a great job directing and all the actors did great with their parts. I have to give them all credit for being brave enough to play these certain characters. The ending was perfect, and this movie really makes you think. I even think it has the power to change someone. And that makes this movie worth seeing."

","I have to admit, when my friend Mike asked me if I had seen American History X, I said no. However, when I went on the internet and saw how good people said it was, I had to see it. I was memorized the entire movie.I have seen my share of Edward Norton movies, but not only was this one the best, but I have never seen one actor put so much emotion and care into one film. Edward Furlong also showed the best change in a performance that I have ever seen. This movie is fantastic, but I will admit, it is hard to watch at some times. How nobody won an Oscar for this film is beyond me. See this movie, you will not be disappointed, I guarantee it. I guarantee if you see this film, which is the greatest movie ever in my opinion, you'll say the same things I am saying. It doesn't matter if you are young or old, black or white, male or female, this is the best drama you will ever see. And coming from a 14 year old from Jersey who loves The Godfather, that is a big statement."
"r_j_t_kelly","10","1","4","23 August 2006"," Absolutely brilliant
","Even if you haven't seen the film, you probably know some of the surrounding hysteria about how its British director (Tony Kaye) tried to have his name taken off the film when a different ending to the one he had planned was imposed by the studio. Ignore the hype though: this is a stand-out film. Beautifully lit and shot in black and white it is a tale of hatred and redemption, exploring far-right racist hatred and the violence that underscores many male relationships. The cinematography and lighting are astounding: this is Kaye's debut film (preceded by an illustrious career as a commercials director) and he triumphs. The performances he draws from his lead actors (Edwards Norton and Furlong)are remarkable, career bests from both and it is depressing, though perhaps not surprising, that neither were recognised with either BAFTA or Oscar wins. It's not an easy film to watch, but it is one that will stay with you for a very long time."

Thank you Mr. Kaye!"
"strangla35","10","1","4","3 August 2006"," Wow... just... wow.
","If you decide to watch this movie, be prepared to be struck to the very core of your soul. Very few movies I have seen manage to dig so deep into my heart as this one has, and I am a critical, skeptical, analytical kind of guy---I am about the furthest thing there is from a sappy, ready-to-cry-at-any-time moviegoer!<br/><br/>Set in Los Angeles, the story of the movie is that Derek Vineyard (Edward Norton) is sent to prison after a double murder that is motivated by racial hatred. During his three year stay, he undergoes changes and realizes the error of his ways, only to find out that his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) is headed down the same path that Derek once was. After getting out on parole, Derek is determined to make sure that Danny does not wind up making the same mistakes as him.<br/><br/>Although the movie jumps back and forth from the present (shot in color) to the past (shot in black and white), it is not confusing in the least.<br/><br/>This movie grinds and twists your emotions like very few other movies can, because it pulls absolutely no punches as it exposes you to some of the darkest facets of human beings. You'll gasp, you'll cringe and you may even cry as the movie demonstrates to you how warped and vicious human beings can become when they are consumed by anger and hatred---and ultimately, the destruction and horrible endings that that anger and hatred leads to if we cling to them long enough. <br/><br/>One last thing---the acting in this movie was phenomenal. Every actor did an astounding job with their character, but I have to mention how off the scales Edward Norton's acting was in this movie. I mean, he has NEVER failed to impress me, but wow... to see him go from a man who is so filled with such high octane rage and hatred, to a man who is consumed by remorse and sorrow as he at last realizes his mistakes, to a <br/><br/>much more soft-spoken, reasonable man who is filled with compassion and concern for his younger brother, and at last to a man who is torn apart by agony and grief as he fully realizes what his mistakes have truly cost him... and to play all of it flawlessly... well, I just can't say enough how good of a performance he gave. <br/><br/>To see the true consequences of one man's hate, and at the same time, seeing that one man's hate tear apart his family---it's something that is not easily forgotten. This movie teaches why, as Edward Furlong's character puts it, ""hate is baggage""."
"valadas","6","1","4","18 May 2006"," Too superficial
","Nazism, fascism or neo-Nazism and neo-fascism got multiple causes. Besides the individual personal psychological ones that turn a human being into a Nazi or a Fascist there are the collective social, economic and political ones which give birth to the movements where the individuals integrate themselves. Without the latter causes the former will be socially ineffective. Therefore the racial problem in USA cannot be treated with this simplicity because it's much more complex than what is shown in this movie. This movie is more about personal motives that make one to become a neo-Nazi even if they assume a form of a certain interpretation of social and economic realities usually a wrong one. It doesn't say practically anything about what is most important i. e. the roots of racism as a global social phenomenon. Without it you cannot understand this question. Of course you can tell me now that the movie doesn't intend to be a sociological treatise and just only to tell us a certain story. Well that may be true but then the movie is worth what it's worth regarding the theme of racism that is subjacent to it. This is undoubtedly an honest movie that tells us the credible story of a young neo-Nazi who repents himself of that, after having been in jail convicted for racial homicide and then tries to prevent his younger brother to follow the same path. But the story is told in a too superficial and not very deep way. It doesn't touch the core of the racial question. In respect to that we have only the discussion at the family table in the first part of the movie among the family members including the Jewish boyfriend of the young man's mother, which discussion ends in a bad way. The rest of the movie loses itself, besides the inevitable violent scenes, in some somewhat ingenuous sentimental ones, lacking intensity. In sum this is a sincere and just movie but not particularly remarkable."

","I'd heard great stories about how brilliant this film would be, and got a little disappointed after watching it. Sure, it's a nice story  with a very clear and unavoidable message  but it did not really disturb me. I like a film to disturb me, to make me doubt my opinions. And I can get disturbed by strange and obsessive people, not by a single swastika now and then. In this movie everything was so obvious, clear cut and outspoken: the dialogs seemed to be taken from high school plays: our thesis on racism'. The filming was smooth, there even were some background violins if I'm not mistaken. But there was nothing raw, nothing hidden, nothing seductive, nothing strangely energetic in this piece. The whole story got told'. And I really disliked the black&white of the flashbacks, that did not add anything worthwhile. Conclusion: Of coarse' I can agree with the message  but the filming was a little cheap. I'm curious about the movie Tony Kaye wanted to make."

The rest of the cast including Beverly D'Angelo, Avery Brooks, Ethan Suplee, Stacey Keach, Fairuza Balk, and Elliot Guild are effective as the supporting characters in their limited screen time. The movie has brutal violence, pervasive strong language, a graphic sex scene early on and then a rape, and nudity so parents should be warned to watch this first before allowing their children to see it. American History x is a powerful film and as mentioned before it's hard to watch at times but this is one movie that shouldn't be missed.

","If you see one film this year that you haven't seen before, make it this one - as far as films go there are very few films that are better than American History X, and none of them were from the past 10 years.<br/><br/>Although its content of neo-Nazi, skin head violence and seemingly bad-taste for a film obviously may put people off, but don't let that fool you. This film is a roller-coaster of emotion, and an epic drama at its finest. In my opinion, the most important point of American History X is not white supremacy, but the compelling and gripping portrayal of A family unit without a father. Most notably between younger and older brothers (Derek and Daniel), but also between a mother and her two sons. The racist and Nazi tones are simply very strong devices to show these bonds during extreme times.<br/><br/>The story is told through current events (filmed in colour) and past events (filmed in black and white), which provide a great contrast in the film. With some very hot direction from Tony Kaye, a good script and a great casting, allows Edward Norton shines. It is one of the greatest performance by a leading actor in a modern film. He Pumps emotion and a real belief into his words, with much conviction that you, the viewer are sucked in and start to believe what he is saying is the truth.<br/><br/>For Edward Nortons performance alone (although there is so much more to love about this film) American History X is firmly in my Top 10."

Another problem I have with it is that it blames the Vinyard family (ie Ed Norton, Ed Furlong, and company) for all the problems in the movie, as if some invisible ether on their souls is invisibly causing all these social problems that they face!
Not one single white person in the movie committed a major crime- that would be all the black characters in the movie! And yet, being a mildly bad Nazi in a gang formed out of necessity, oh! Why that is bordering on unforgiveable!
How about some logic applied to these academic eggheads?? Maybe next time, make a movie about white people who live on their own, where they don't have to face the challenges of a multi-racial hell hole like Los Angeles!!

But the fact that truth told in the beginning about the gangs and ruination of the neighborhood was glossed over was wrong.

"tiagodz","5","1","6","23 October 2015"," Marxist Agenda
","American History X intentionally mixes up concepts to cause confusion to viewers. It relates crimes motivated by racism to conservative ideas in order to cause the viewer to mistakenly associate racism to conservatism.<br/><br/>For example, in the scene with the discussion at the dinner table, Derek delivers many TRUE facts. For example, he says that the act of someone finding an excuse to loot a store is nothing but disrespect for law and community, and not a morally fair act (supposedly legitimated by a situation of economical difficulty, or any other reason), meaning that nothing justifies robbing someone. Right after saying this, the discussion goes to a racist bias (where Derek is obviously wrong). And right after this, Derek's sister gives Marxist propaganda on how crime is caused by 'social inequalities' (and is therefore justifiable), and not a matter of moral values. That is saying it is OK to rob someone if they are richer than you. Derek than argues (correctly) that this opinion of hers is just like taking one thing (robbery, for example) and calling it something else (redistribution, for example, or, to quote Derek, it's like saying ""It's not crime, it's poverty""), with the intent to alleviate the responsibility of the one who commits it. That's exactly what Marxism does.<br/><br/>This twisting of concepts happen in other passages of the film, where the speeches and dialogues intertwine racist and conservative ideas. For example, in the scene where Derek fairly criticizes welfare (which is basically looting tax-payers to give privileges to others) and right away he says something racist.<br/><br/>The director's intent is clear: to unfairly associate racism to conservatism using a Nazi character to place conservative and racist ideas side by side, thus leading the naive viewer to wrongly believe these ideas are one and the same."

","This movie is seriously flawed. Like everything about it is flawed. The slow motion is dreadful, the flashback scenes are almost always terrible and the message is ridiculous. A few specific awful pieces of the film include the fact that Danny has a single night to write this paper and does so with the eloquence of F. Scott Fitzgerald, the entire basketball game scene and how much blood Danny has in his body. But the worst part of the movie is definitely the idea that Derek needed to meet a nice black person in order for him to change his views. I get it has to do with him being sheltered and closed-minded but it doesn't make sense and gives the viewer a horrible idea of how racial differences can be solved. The film tries to push an agenda on the audience so hard and, at least in my eyes, falls flat on its face with its most important message. It's a major problem when a character's white supremacy rhetoric makes more sense than his reason for being reformed. There are countless cliches and more moments of bad acting. I don't think Norton did anything special and nobody else was good."

It was pretentious and heavy-handed, with a nonsensical story line trying so hard to mass itself off as gritty and profound. The swelling, dramatic orchestral music is horribly overused, along with such other tired cinematic cliches as unnecessary slow-motion to show the audience that they are seeing a pivotal moment, and black-and-white as a pseudo-artistic sign that we are seeing a flashback. The whole thing has a very cheesy after school special-type feel.<br/><br/>The dialog is awful, both in its writing and delivery. Every line is spoken in anger, and nearly every line by the main characters contains the f-word, which is spoken louder and slower than every other word for emphasis, so you know these are angry, mean people talking. The dialog is unrealistic and forced, and watching it leaves you feeling like it was written by Kevin Smith, trying to write a Very Special Episode.<br/><br/>The frame story is completely irrelevant and serves only to give the movie a title. The principal tells Edward Furlong's character that he will now be taking a special course called American History X, in order to learn the folly of liking Mein Kampf. Instead of seeing the progression of the character over weeks as he learns difficult, complex lessons about life and love versus hate, Furlong is told to write a paper about his brother (Norton), who is about to be released from prison after serving a long, three-year sentence for triple homicide(?). Over the course of the night, Norton tells everyone that he doesn't want to be a Neo Nazi anymore. Furlong doesn't take his seriously, and goes to a Neo Nazi party that evening instead of (but also apparently in addition to) writing the paper. Norton later tells Furlong that the Nazis were mean to him in prison, so Furlong changes everything about his outlook overnight and writes a paper expressing that. Then he gets killed by some angry black guys in the bathroom before turning in his paper, because that's apparently a fine substitute for an actual ending to the story.<br/><br/>I mean, it's a little more complex than that, but not much. It's not any less dumb than that, though.<br/><br/>If you like dramatic music, people being pointlessly angry, characters who are either completely one-dimensional or incredibly inconsistent, melodramatic music, people yelling ""No!"" in slow motion, black-and-white as an ""artistic"" choice, and being beaten over the head by an unbelievably obvious moral with very little human relatability, this movie is for you."
"brackster007","10","1","9","3 December 2006"," One of the Best movies I've ever seen!
","American History X is one of the best movies ever on the topic that it is written on. I say this because the movie brings out the changing attitude of the human nature towards another human/animal. And best of all this change is so quickly done that it just is amazing. This movie according to me has a perfect pace,for its nature with all the characters in its place. The two brothers having to fight the background that they come from and for Derek to realize,during his jail time that a human being is not judged by his color but by his soul which is colorless. This is actually according to me a lesson in itself to all of us. All in all this movie moved me and thats why i say its one of the best movies."

","There are few movies that can bring tears to a man's heart and this is one of them. He doesn't cry because it's a love story, or because it's an utter tragedy, he cries because he sees the world for a moment and perhaps for the rest of his life through different eyes after watching this movie. I didn't even want to watch this movie because of the title. At first I thought a movie with an 'X', hhmm it might be about some twisted tale about Malcom X or people like him (ie. Nation of Islam before he left them). Then I read its about Neo-Nazis, and I felt like its now a racist movie on the other side of the spectrum. Either way I decided, watch it, learn what is really out there, no matter how much you may disagree with it. That was one of the best decisions I ever made.<br/><br/>Not only is this movie based on a true story, but it makes us question ourselves. Are what we believe to be right and wrong so clear? Where do we draw the line? Where is it written that being white or black should automatically makes us enemies? This movie is deep. I fell in love with the cast, all of them, black and white, but most notably the main character 'Derek' and his little brother. Those two are an inspiration and all of us need to take examples from them.<br/><br/>Whatever it takes, everyone in America, no, everyone in the World should see this movie. Absolutely Superb!"
"thecrow22","10","1","10","15 October 2006"," Norton Shows his worth once again.
","After seeing Fight Club I knew that Edward Norton was something special, but after seeing this movie, I can say with utmost certainty that he is one of the greatest actors of American Cinema.<br/><br/>Norton plays a former skinhead who is released from prison after serving 3 years for murder. He finds that his Brother(Edward Furlong) is heading down the same path that put him in jail. A lot of the story is told through flashbacks, which are in black and white. At first the black and white was a turnoff to me, but it grew on me and added to the way the story was told.<br/><br/>Edward Furlong also does a stand-up role as Norton's younger brother. His voice narrates the movie from the point of view of a paper that he has to right for a special history class that he has to take because he is not working well in his class(Writing a paper on Mein Kampf will do that to you).<br/><br/>This is one of the true movies in American Cinema that everyone should be required to see. It brings out a lot of truths in the Nazi movement in America and shows the horrors that it can bring. Edward Norton and Edward Furlong truly tell a story that is worth telling.<br/><br/>10/10"

","To be honest I do not remember all of what happens as I got confused with most of it, I just like it for the stars and stand-out moments, i.e. racism, violence, etc. The story is built up with the present day (in colour) and the past (in black and white) with the two brothers of the film, Derek (Fight Club's Oscar nominated Edward Norton) and Danny Vinyard (Terminator 2's Edward Furlong). Basically Derek went to prison for racism and hatred, and Danny is soon following. When Derek's father is killed on duty, Derek's view on mankind is changed, and he finds out in prison there is good and bad in every person, whatever race. Danny now has to be convinced of this newfound enlightened. Also starring Beverly D'Angelo as Doris Vinyard, Avery Brooks as Dr. Bob Sweeney, Jennifer Lien as Davina Vinyard, My Name Is Earl's Ethan Suplee as Seth Ryan, Stacy Keach as Cameron Alexander, Fairuza Balk as Stacey, Elliott Gould as Murray and Guy Torry as Lamont. I think this is a really controversial film not for those sensitive to race issues, oh, and the fact that Derek is pretty much has the persona of a Nazi German, and the tattooed Swastika.

","Likeable albeit thoroughly preposterous nonsense that somehow sits in the IMDb top 40 ahead of titles like Modern Times, Bicycle Thieves and Rashomon.<br/><br/>Edward Norton plays a white supremacist who learns love and acceptance of black people after going to jail and befriending a black guy who tells him jokes. He then realises that white supremacists aren't all they're cracked up to be after they rape him in the prison showers... something he later claims he's ""glad"" happened.<br/><br/>The film eventually enters an ever higher point of absurdism, as overblown, showstopping music - the kind only an American studio would think was appropriate - fills the screen. Scenes like two brothers tearing down their bedroom decorations of Nazi memorabilia are pat and simplistic, and too ""easy"". The plot lines take over the movie, and characters change from scene to scene because they're required to, not because of realistic motives. Even a typically eccentric performance by Avery Brooks can't rescue the film from its ludicrous premise.<br/><br/>At date of writing, American History X is rated on the IMDb as the 35th greatest movie of all time, comfortably ahead of Citizen Kane, Taxi Driver and Apocalypse Now. It's watchable stuff, possibly for all the wrong reasons, but probably shouldn't even be in the top 350, let alone top 35."

","This movie has been finally crossed off of my watchlist. Apart from the fact that it's kinda clear how the story will develop, I have nothing against this movie. You can really tell what exactly will happen in each scene, so no big twists or surprises. However, the story is good enough to keep your focus in tact.<br/><br/>Mr. Norton has shown his great range, and ability for long monologues. What I ejoyed about the movie is the variety of scenes, certainly took them a long time to prepare all the locations.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if this movie is re-watchable, for my taste it has been too strong and long, that said, I understand if so many other people would watch it more than once.<br/><br/>It's a great piece on not only Neonazism but rasism itslef, and what rasicm may bring to a society. It emphasizes on the great dangers of prejudices among all races which is not exclusive to a certain country or skin color, even sadder!
I was wondering how easily the adolescent could be radicalized, and how important it is to educate them properly; specifically, parents' role in this. With everything going on in the world, now, watching this movie is for sure justified and well-advised for it shows a great deal of radicalized, emotionally abused, and hyped-up actions and their inevitable consequences."
"Bored_Dragon","7","0","1","30 October 2018"," Even amazing Edward Norton could not make me blind for its flaws
","I understand how this film managed to hype the masses, but it's a complete mystery to me how it withstood the test of time and even after twenty years it is considered to be one of the best films of all time. The movie undoubtedly has its qualities, but its flaws are much more numerous and painful.<br/><br/>On the positive side, if the idea was to criticize Neo-Nazism and racism, I support that. I also like the idea to make the movie more effective by running the whole thing from the angle of a skinhead. And the strongest trump of the film is that this skinhead was played by Edward Norton. His appearance, charisma, acting skills and the transformation of his character through the film definitely deserve an Oscar, but unfortunately, he was in competition with Benigni's performance in ""Life Is Beautiful"", against whom no one would stand a chance.<br/><br/>Furlong's performance is not for underestimation either, but besides two of them, the most of other characters are pale and uninteresting. In fact, most of the film is totally unconvincing, which may be a good thing, because if it already (accidentally) sends the wrong message, it is better that it is not powerful. I am literally allergic to racism and Neo-Nazism and I found myself rooting for Skinheads... Although I believe that the author's intention was to criticize it, the film instead romanticizes the ""white power"" movement. I suppose the purpose of this romanticizing is to show us how it all looks in the eyes of the kids who decide to join it, and that would be perfectly fine if the film showed the other side of the coin equally striking. But if I, in my forties, so easily fell under the influence of this romanticizing and found myself rooting for Skinheads during almost the entire film, I am afraid to even imagine the influence it could have on immature kids with crazed hormones, and that is something I can not forgive. There are many examples, but the basketball game is one of the most obvious. I'm pretty sure we all rooted for Skinheads to win the bet, and even worse, they did. And then follows zenith of believability when black guys quietly pick up their things and leave the court with lowered tails. Yea, sure, in reality it would happen exactly like that.<br/><br/>By far the weakest point of the film is the end. I think the idea was to aggravate the overall impression and strength of the film with earthquake tragedy, but that murder in the school toilet was so stupid and unconvincing that, instead of tears, caused my jaw to fall in disbelief. Neither there was appropriate motivation for it, nor would anyone, even wildly adolescent, brought it up in such a place and in such way. I knew that in the end one of the brothers would have to die, but I expected them to get killed out of the passing car as they walked to the school, or through the restaurant window, and I expected the gang to kill Norton as a retaliation for the black guys he had killed. That would be upsetting and make sense. But this toilet murder was simply stupid. And what's even worse, it's not even the original end of the movie. After the toilet murder, there was supposed to be a scene which would somewhat repair the damage made by this ridiculous killing. According to the script, the film ends with a scene in which Norton stands in front of a mirror shaving his head. This scene would round the story perfectly, made it more realistic, convincing and vigorously tragic, but Norton refused to do it.<br/><br/>Norton's performance is fantastic and so striking that it is perfectly understandable that it has blinded many eyes and distracted them from all the drawbacks of this film. If you are watching a movie focused exclusively on Norton, you will easily overlook all its shortcomings and experience it as a masterpiece, but I think that, if you watch the film again after reading this review, you will understand what I'm talking about and deprive it of some undeserved credit. Ten out of ten for Edward Norton, but about four or five for all the flaws, some of which I did not mention.<br/><br/>7/10"

but the question is always how good is the movie
but such films always seem to excite me as an excuse or excuse and not to torture white minorities in front of the camera.<br/><br/>So I just went a few scenes too long, I found a few of the dialogues are completely pulled on the ass hair because skinheads are so bald. But I have to applaud the movie because it's the first movie of my life that actually showed racism in a realistic way.<br/><br/>Of course, there are other films about racism but people are just ugly ass bones screaming. As someone who belongs to a minority, we noticed in parallel and this was perfectly captured in the film because the problem of most racists here is that they believe they are right because they are convinced that they have to help others and with their actions You achieve that.
Of course I could still talk all the key scenes everywhere, the famous scenes like the conversations, the basketball scene or, of course, the curb scene the distance is more famous than the movie itself but I focus on the important.
And say the film is very realistic and artfully decent but not really good

","Years have past since Danny saw his neo-nazi brother, kill several black males who were robbing his car. Since he has been in prison, Derek's legacy has grown among the white gangs of the area and Danny has followed in his brother's footsteps. When he writes a racist paper for school, his teacher makes his write a new paper, focusing on recent history – that of his brother and how he influenced him. Meanwhile Derek leaves prison a reformed man with only the desire to repair the damage he once did to his family with his beliefs and his hate.<br/><br/>I was looking forward to see this film as I missed it at the cinema and am a firm believer that Edward Norton is one of the most talented actors of his generation and is always worth seeing (even if some of his films have given less than he deserves). It was maybe better that I only saw it recently as I was able to enjoy it without all the hype and fighting over who did what to who, or all the comments from director Kaye as to his opinions of the film. Having seen the pompous fool interviewed several times, I find it quite self assuring that I don't agree with his opinions of it!<br/><br/>The plot is a mix of flashback into Derek's hate filled past (told in b&w) and the present (colour) where he is desperate to save his brother and family from suffering anymore from his 'sins'. As a basic narrative the film struggles at times to make a solid story and seems to be trying too hard to create confrontations to up the drama within the film. It still works mind you but this is not it's best asset.<br/><br/>The main thing the film does well is to be a very true representation of white male disillusionment. The film avoids painting these people as monsters straightaway (although makes no bones that they are confused, misled and wrong). The arguments and discussions they have in the film are not so far from reality that the characters seem fiction – the characters and the film's world seem very real. The film's message that hate is no way to live no matter who it is directed at may be a little simplistic but it is a valid point. One particular weakness which I felt was a little hamfisted was Derek's 'road to Damascus' experience in prison – it was OK but was far too easy given the character we had just seen brutally kill several black men.<br/><br/>The other main selling point the film has is a performance by Norton that simply ensures he steals nearly every scene he is in. In b&w flashback he is at his best – a larger than life character who is never allowed to just be seen as a thug. Norton acts out the various stages of his life well and makeup ensures that he looks younger when required. In the present he is less dominant but still is very good giving a different performance. Furlong is also very strong, although he only has a few scenes where he is able to be outside of Norton's shadow. Support from Balk, Gould, D'Angelo and Brooks is mixed – Gould's Jewish character is only in the film to allow for one scene to occur, while Brooks' righteous teacher is simply a 'morally upright teacher' with no meat on his character.<br/><br/>Overall this is a good film, which occasionally struggles when it forces the issue in the 'present' scenes. However for the most part it is a powerful film which owes a lot to well captured themes and an excellent performance from Norton."

","** This contains spoilers! **<br/><br/>Edward Norton is frighteningly believable as a skinhead in this movie. In general, I thought the acting was good. This movie is kind of like The Shawshank Redemption -- except with less hair. <br/><br/>It's well shot and edited. The pacing slows down a bit for the second half (which is pretty typical of most film plot arcs). However, it delivers the goods. <br/><br/>One issue I had with this movie is that it borders on being a bit too soft in certain areas. For example, Derek's character changes a bit too quickly. I understand that there's limited time in a single film to explore a person's change of heart. To that end, having him not cry after he gets prison-raped would have been a better way to go. A guy that's actually that pis*ed off and aggressive would not cry in a situation like that. He'd be upset -- no doubt, but he wouldn't break like that. It would be more believable if he reacted like someone who was injured in a fight and genuinely insulted and even embarrassed (but not willing to show it). More stoic is what I'm thinking here. The crying should have only happened once in the film and that's at the end when his brother dies. That would give the death scene at the end even more weight. <br/><br/>At the end of the day, Derek cares about his family and that's the secret to cracking his armor."

","This Movie gonna make me happy every time i watch it. The scariest and most convincing scenes are the ones in which we see the skinheads bonding. They're led by Derek's brilliant speech-making and filled by drugs, beer, tattoos, heavy metal and the need all insecure people feel to belong to a movement greater than themselves. It is assumed in their world (the beaches and playgrounds of the Venice area of L.A.) that all races stick together and are at undeclared war with all others. What we get, finally, is a series of well-drawn sketches and powerful scenes, in search of an organizing principle. The movie needs sweep where it only has plot. And Norton, effective as he is, comes across more as a bright kid with bad ideas than as a racist burning with hate. (I am reminded of Tim Roth's truly satanic skinhead in ""Made in Britain,"" a 1982 film by Alan Clarke.) Kaye wanted to have his name removed as the film's director, arguing that the film needed more work and that Norton re-edited some sequences. We will probably never know the truth behind the controversy. My guess is that the post-production repairs were inspired by a screenplay that attempted to cover too much ground in too little time and yet hastens to a conventional conclusion.<br/><br/>Still, I must be clear: This is a good and powerful film.

I can still hear those teeth chattering against the concrete when I think of monotone intro that sets the tone. This movie could have been made today and it would have been great, but the 90s quality and feel inherent in the picture sets it apart. There are so many moments through the story that could be seen as shock value, but it always seems right. It's a perfectly gritty film about a very dark undercurrent that runs through America and likely always will to some extent. It's raw, honest, and ultimately heartbreaking as humans are terribly, terribly flawed, and that makes for compelling story lines."
"josephdenuzzio","9","0","1","1 July 2016"," Great film, regardless of any bias one may have.
","While not perfect of course, this movie does do a wonderful job of exposing what racism and hate can do to a person or what effects they have on families. The main character, Danny, finds himself following the same White Supremacist cult that his older brother Derek had followed, which ultimately led to his arrest early in the film. Throughout the rest of the film, both Derek and Danny go through the same character arc - from racism to tolerance. There are many flashback, as well as present scenes in the movie that are very difficult to watch, but this is how director Tony Kaye constructs the picture of racism in households in America and the effects it has. The only complaint I have about this movie is the ending, I believe it is too ambiguous for the movie; but then again, it may be best that way."

","American History X is a mad frenzy wrapped in beautiful apparatus of direction, cinematography and screenplay. Although it showcases plethora of emotions, it does so in an unapologetic manner. Movie delivers a powerful and concise message and it all hits you well. Movie scores much less on symbolism and subtlety. But, it scores an 'A' in delivering what it wanted to, in a very direct fashion. It deals with morals, conditions, reasons and consequences of an ideology and gives precise conclusion. It scratches layers subject like racism and makes you dwell deep into all related aspects. Now to story telling and drama, movie does go overboard but keeping in mind the delivery of message, it was highly essential. Journey does get wonderfully erratic. A work on understanding psyche of community and its strong ties are well highlighted but scratch underneath, and you find dark hollowness. Protagonist found just that, as we take a journey with him and his family. Movie is well shot. Close angles captured emotions perfectly, to the point it makes us feel as if we ourselves are encountering situations and questions on subject. All actors do a fantastic job, nothing much on it. It could have been better written or perhaps meanings could have been hidden. Like portraying a step away from such ideology was shown in fully melodramatic manner of removing all posters from room. Overall, its a movie that engrosses you, takes you to uncomfortable zones, puts you into situation many a times, and delivers a particular message that hatred induces such actions and thoughts, and anything based on hatred at its core can bring no good to you."
"Screen_Blitz","9","0","1","5 March 2016"," Powerful, unflinching portrayal of racism
","Racism is major issue that has been going on America for many generations now, and what still goes on in our society today. Many may be familiar with some of the most notorious racist gangs such as the Ku Klux Klan or the Aryan Brotherhood It has negatively affected the way we function as a society and lead to many tragedies and controversies in many areas of our society. This dark drama directed by Tony Kaye paints a powerful and brutal picture on racism and bigotry, and the consequences they can be lead to. Set in Venice Beach, California, this film stars Edward Norton as Derek Vinyard, a once-happy young man with a healthy family who lost his father after he was shot by an African-American for simply doing his job. Angered by the circumstances of his death, Derek turns from an innocent young man into a cold, hate-filled skinhead, and becomes the leader of a white supremacist gang who exercises hatred against every racial group outside the white protestant. After getting arrested for brutally killing a black man who tries to rob his car, Derek spends three years in prison where he unexpectedly develops a bond with black man Lamont (played by Guy Torry) who teaches them that not all black men are evil. Upon leaving the prison, Derek comes home as a changed man, but learns that his younger brother Danny (played by Edward Furlong) is heading down the same path and tries to help him from suffering the same fate.<br/><br/>This movie is made to paint a realistic portrayal of the life of skinheads, and the consequences that ensue. The film succeeds this feat very well and what results is a dark and gritty powerhouse drama that is incredibly difficult to watch. Writer David McKenna gives a powerful, if horrifying treatment to the characters and the story, and when it all comes on-screen, it pulls the audience into a dark atmosphere that rarely lets them rest. During the opening scene, we are introduced to the main character Derek Vinyard, sporting a shaved head and a swastika tattooed on his chest, representing him as a Neo- Nazi, within those minutes; we learn the atrocities of this character and his cruel, racist aspect. Vinyard is played by Edward Norton is astoundingly convicted in the role, he just swallows up the role with his performance and the scenes of his character spitting at others with his cold-hearted bigotry and hatred feel frighteningly real.<br/><br/>When tackling the issues of racism, the story does not hold back nor does it try to manipulate audience with emotionality as both the emotional (and physical) intensity come almost naturally through the visceral storytelling. The story is told with a subplot of Derek's younger brother Danny being assigned by his principal Dr. Sweeney (played by Avery Brooks) to write about Derek after his teacher (who is Jewish) sends him to the office for submitting an offensive essay on the book 'Mein Kempf'. The story progresses through Danny typing up his paper while jumping back and forth through a series of flashbacks (shown in black and white) showing the brothers' significant moments related to their white supremacy. These scenes include disorienting hate speeches against blacks, Asians, Jews, and pretty much every foreign racial group by Derek, a supermarket raid, a more detail and disturbing depiction of the murder Derek commits, and his experience of redemption he gained while serving time in prison. The story flows on well without just a minor flaw towards the end dealing a revelation of the character's racist behavior that feels a bit too tacked at the last minute. And it builds up to the one of the most shocking and heart-wrenching endings that leaves you speechless.<br/><br/>American History X is very brutal portrayal of racism, and one that is very difficult to sit through. But at the same time, it is very important film to watch as it teaches viewers a powerful message about how racism not only hurts others, but can devastate you as a person. Edward Norton's performance is absolutely amazing and the writing is utterly inspiring at its best. This is a film I recommend, but probably not to those under 17 as the material can be very challenging to handle, even for the most harden individuals."
"charles_ddp","8","0","1","29 February 2016"," You can't get bored
","Recently, I saw American History X again, because I had some work to do about it and because I was very pleased with it the first time I saw it. The truth is, you can't get bored by watching it.<br/><br/>Without intention to challenge the fact that it is a great movie, something that can disappoint people is that some scenes are probably far too romantic and easily predictable. Theoretically, the movie claims to point the finger at racism ; it attempts to show us the conversion of the protagonist to the path of righteousness. Of course it is a noble goal, but some parts of the story look naive or even childish (Derek's conversion seems absolutely not rational for example), despite the fact that others are actually maybe not enough romantic because they tend to show us a reality which looks far away from us : hardcore violence and racism.<br/><br/>In this review I would like to examine the inner morality of the movie. American History X has often been accused of a ""morally dangerous cinematic seduction"". What the critics mean is that the film would manipulate the viewer through ""glamorizing an immoral and hate- filled neo-nazi protagonist"", instead of denouncing racism. All this by using cinematic effects and techniques. However, I don't think that this argument is relevant. The film, as a matter of fact, takes place in an historical context and shows Derek's life and what happens to him. Of course you will understand why he's angry, how he became who he is. Nonetheless, it doesn't mean that it justifies his ideology : it is the way that the film uses to introduce us the white supremacy groups world and the conflicts of those times. The techniques employed may allow for many viewers a degree of sympathy towards Derek, but that is actually for me an interesting point of the movie. What I mean is that we can see the story within that contested groups and this is the master card of American History X."

","Tony Kaye made his feature directorial debut with this dramatic exploration into the roots of race hatred in America. In a shocking opening scene, teen Danny (Edward Furlong) races to tell his older brother, Nazi Derek (Edward Norton), about the young blacks breaking into his car in front of the house, whereupon Derek gets his gun and with no forethought shoots the youths in their tracks. Tried and convicted, Derek is sent away for three years in prison, where he acquires a different outlook as he contrasts white-power prisoners with black Lamont (Guy Torry), his prison laundry co-worker and eventual pal. Meanwhile, Danny, with a shaved head and a rebellious attitude, seems destined to follow in his big brother's footsteps. After Danny writes a favorable review of Hitler's Main leader, black high-school principal Sweeney (Avery Brooks) puts Danny in his private ""American History X"" course and assigns him to do a paper about his older brother, who was a former student of Sweeney's. This serves to introduce flashbacks, with the film backtracking to illustrate Danny's account of Derek's life prior to the night of the shooting.

","Feurer, command—we follow. It was the slogan of Hitler's tsunami back in those days, which is still found in individuals, underground single-man and obsessive people; they're obsessed with a certain lifestyle, and believe not in discussion, neither in argumentation, but in imposition. Bald-headed or not, individuals like Derek are reality, so are Danny(s) who're confused in choosing roads. What makes their predicaments even worse is the double-minded composition of the world, and that's something that is going to remain constant for a long time. Hence, so are the extremist mobs. I'm not declaring them wrong, I'm only calling them ambivalent. I'm aware of the Holocaust and the society that thinks it's perfectly justified. I wouldn't contradict their viewpoint, but my promulgation will certainly devise the conduct of suggestion, interaction, and double-exchange rather than straight exterminations. I don't wish to be called a monologue-r, although that title gains more viewer-ship. ""Appeal to popularity"" is an argumentative fallacy that individuals of all levels adopt in their conversational discourse. Now let's go to the review. <br/><br/>American History X captures absence/lack/irrationality of egalitarianism in a very unique way. Using Nazism, it extends its effects to the black community. Edward Norton (crazy-eyes) suited the role only from physical and expressive way; he was pretty bad from the ""vocal"" perspective; the guy can't do working-class roles at all; I mean let's face it, the guy's voice appears to be of an over-intellectualized kid doing weed, not a hipster or gangster. His acting nonetheless was superb, like when officers are arresting him and he looks at Danny with that psychotic smile (crazy-eyes, no?) The nigga-facta was good. Almost all the extras in the movie were African-Americans. I think this was a directorial flaw. America's still flowing with Whites. I'm not personally against blacks, in fact I've a lot of Afro-Am friends myself. But that doesn't mean that you flood the set with them. But then looking at the low-budget, it's acceptable. Moreover, the movie didn't look at perfection, but realism and digging the small-scale on-goings in America and potentially all over the globe.<br/><br/>American History has nothing but Norton's acting and screenplay (even that limited to the amount of touch with real-life scenario). But what it has is delivered with excellence. The story keeps you ponder over the ruthlessness of all sides. The world isn't so perfect as shown. You can't expect things to be rational, or mildly reasonable. Even paternal guidance isn't entirely logical, neutral and aimed at resolving physical and mental issues. <br/><br/>I was hit down by the movie, and I started to question the logical sense and accuracy of ""white man's burden"" claim. From Derek's skull-crushing to his assault in prison, and from that to Danny's ultimate redemption, everything builds up your trust with the movie, and believe me, whatever it says, you'll start following it the same way. So yeah that's probably the only good-thing about it. <br/><br/>With everything said, I think if you look from the low-budget perspective and director's mindset, you'll realize that film's intention and imparting was limited and it successfully got what it aimed. However, from the dramaturgical viewpoint, it lacks several accessories."

The story is amezing.Men are commonly raped in prison—especially if they do what Derek did. And, in a movie about white supremacy,Nazism and gangs the violence is to be expected. What I like about this movie is that it shows something prevelent in our world today—hate. It must be remembered that we as Christians are in class despised by these very groups. Yet our children, on an almost daily basis, are being surrounded by and sometimes sucked into joining gangs.

","A former skin head in L.A recently released from prison and now reformed, attempts to change his ways and correct his past battles, to better his brother that is following down the same dark path he had been down.<br/><br/>The theme of American History X is struggle to change. Derek from the opening scene is almost looked at as a Christ like figure when the cops arrive they ask him to drop the weapon and turn around. The camera angle is upward and it goes slow motion. This scene makes him appear like a superhuman or God like figure especially when he puts his arms out like he is on a cross. Derek's tattoos are very noticeable in this scene you see the D.O.C tattoo which normally means department of corrections. But if you really think of it as a struggle to change to help his brother Danny than you might say it could stand for die on cross like God did.<br/><br/>After the opening scene the story is told from Danny's point of view. Their father was a fire fighter that had been shot while on duty trying to put out a fire at a possible drug house. Their father seemed to plant a racist seed in Derek and Danny's brain at breakfast one morning when Derek had brought up about his teacher having them read a book about affirmative action. From their on he flashed back to the coming of power of his brother in the DOC. Everyone in the DOC seemed to look up to his brother as a leader. On the basketball courts the DOC play an all-black basketball team for the rights to stay on the courts. Derek ends up slam dunking a basketball to win the game he then hangs on the rim. This is shot in slow motion once again peering up at him hanging showing him as a power figure once again. While in prison Derek starts to become friends with a black man Lamont. They become friends while working in the laundry room at the prison. While Derek is locked up Danny starts to get into the DOC heavily and following after Cameron. Dr. Bob Sweeney was a teacher of Derek's in high school, and is now Danny's teacher. He ends up helping to get Derek out of prison early after he had been raped by other White Supremacist for becoming friends with black people in prison. Dr. Bob Sweeney wants Derek to help get Danny back on the straight and narrow. Once out Derek breaks ties with the DOC and starts to get Danny turned around. Everything seems to be looking up for Danny, Derek and their mother until the closing scene of the movie Danny has had a run in with a black student from his school in which this time the other student is finally going to get the last word. <br/><br/>American History X in my opinion is very similar to Menace to Society in the way that the characters end up being fairly innocent in the start of the movie turn for the worst and start to make a turnaround for the better again and in both movies end up dying.<br/><br/>Like I have pointed out I think the slow motion scenes along with the angle are two techniques to help show the theme of this movie. Everyone seems to look up to Derek and the slow motion throughout the different scenes adds to his power and authoritativeness of his character in this movie, by looking at him at an upward appearance along with panning over/ at him and his muscular physique in slow motion to make sure he is given attention.<br/><br/>""No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin, or his background, or his religion. People must learn to hate, and if they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love, for love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite."" -Nelson Mandela"

","This is a very shocking movie. The story is very good and the actors perform it greatly. But what really shocks you is the idea that it is an entirely feasible situation; that the ideas the characters express in the movies is also expressed by real people in real life situations. Although this movie revolves around Neo-Nazis, it does reflect upon tensions within society as a whole. It's not only about skinheads and their crazy WW2 ideologies, it's in general about the misconception of delimiting ""us"" and ""them"", about failing to see how human all of us are, and instead turning to the humanness of ""my"" group, and the lack of humanity of everyone else. It is about the very human attitude of putting the blame into other people, and it is also about that other very human attitude of guiding our behaviors according to our feelings as opposed to common sense. It is about the importance of the teenage years for the future adult, and it is about how traumatic can it be to realize one was wrong. It is a movie that definitely makes you think."
"powermandan","10","0","1","18 August 2014"," The Best Acting Ever Filmed. Coming from an actor and hardcore movie buff.
","I am an actor, as well as a film fanatic. I have seen them all from De Niro in Taxi Driver to Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs. None, and I mean none of these performances are quite as good as Edward Norton in this. This movie is about Norton who is a reformed skinhead who tries to prevent his little brother (Furlong) from following in his footsteps. One thing great is how big of a shock Norton was. Norton is a geek: his name, face and voice are all proof. But he is far from a geek in this. There are 3 Nortons: a nice high school kid, a monstrous neo-Nazi and reformed gentleman, all of which he does so convincingly with such passion that connects deep within the viewer's soul. The kid he plays is so nice and innocent. The monster he plays is so angry, frustrated and full of boiling hatred. This stage is the most intense acting I have ever seen too. The anger, intensity and apathy can make the viewers very uncomfortable. Yet, he is so well developed that you have no choice but to sympathize him. An actor has done a job well done if he can push the buttons of a viewer. The reformed man he plays is heroic and so philosophical that the viewer will love him. What really sets this performance apart are the transitions from his character's stages. It is during the transition that where the themes of the story are shown. Sure he is only briefly a regular high school kid, but going from a racist monster to someone reformed was so perfect. It is done in such a smooth and gradual flow that is unlike any other chemistry for a single character. Other great pieces of chemistry for a single character don't flow at a gradual pace like this.<br/><br/>I think that this is one of the greatest movies in history that deserves high ranking on many lists. The acting by Norton is better than everybody else's, and it also has a strong delivery of an important message. These kinds of movies have the biggest impacts on viewers. I found this to be the 90's version of Raging Bull. Both contain intense acting be the main characters who are fuelled by extreme anger and personal demons who find out that hate is wrong and a waste of time. What makes this better is Norton's performance and the message being clearer.<br/><br/>4/4"

"dom-lerose-8","Null","0","1","28 June 2014"," 'American History X' is an important and powerful drama about setting a good example and redemption.
","Having a role model is a great way to have guidance through life to achieve greatness. Following the wrong path and looking up to the wrong version of a truly good human being is a great way to become lost and destroyed. 'American History X' tells the story of two brothers in Venus Beach, California who get enthralled in the modern day Neo-Nazi crime. Derek Vineyard (played blisteringly by Edward Norotn) grew up as a bright young man with strong passions and great qualities. However, being highly influenced by his fathers prejudice views and death caused by an African-American, he turned into a skinhead who after beating three black men in a basketball game is targeted as revenge due to tension of the game. The leader of the men is Derek's main rival, and when Derek storms out shooting, he leaves two brutally killed and one escaped. After wounding one of the two men, he brutally kills him which causes his arrest. After being released from jail, his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) who highly looks up to Derek as a leader has turned into the younger version of Derek, who is angry due to the higher population of non-Caucasian's in his neighborhood. He looks at Derek as a hero and is full of anger. As Derek tries to teach Danny his new ways, his past comes back to haunt the both of them. Racism is a degrading view that is acted on in our country, and that is the catalyst for this masterpiece. It isn't making a big political statement, it's just showing how some scary people view the diversity of our country and what it does to peoples lives. The brotherhood between Danny and Derek is very touching and shows how important guidance and setting a good example is. The realism and the power this film offsets is what makes this film touching. It doesn't end all happy and clean. It serves as a warning for doing what is right and how your actions can ruin your life. A touch of beauty is portrayed at last to give a little hope though. Edward Norton's performance is so special because he plays two different personalities. The before and post skinhead is a sweet and likable character who you will most likely be moved by. However, when he is shown in flashbacks as a skinhead, he is pure evil and full of dirty words and views. Tony Kaye's directing is very special because of the color and motion he shoots in. During flashbacks in which Derek is a racist, he uses black and white to set the dark mood and color for when he has redeemed himself. The slow-motion scenes are very beautiful and gripping, as well as the cinematography around the beach which serves as a metaphor. The intensity is strong in the scenes that contain necessary violence. This film shows the views of insane people, but shows how 'bad people' can redeem themselves and how that their is reasoning for what they do. The story is also a wake-up call for people down the wrong path and how your life could be ruined due to your actions. This is a very powerful and gripping work of art done perfectly to give the audience the affect they deserve."

","I have watched American History X three times now, and the reaction and feeling I get after watching it is always the same: stunned. Tony Kaye, who directed the movie, plunged us into the troubled and dangerous life of Venice Beach, California, torn apart by the different gangs fighting for their space. Edward Norton and Edward Furlong star in the film, and leave us both tongue-tied at the end of this amazing drama.<br/><br/>The movie tells the story of two brothers involved in a Neo-Nazi movement, after the death of their father killed by a black drug dealer. The older brother, DerekVinyard (Edward Norton), is sentenced to 3 years of prison for manslaughter, and comes back from it with his beliefs entirely changed. The people he met and the things he saw and endured during this time made him realize the true and important things in life. He will then try to open his brother's (Edward Furlon) eyes to stop him from becoming what he used to be.<br/><br/>One of the big paradoxes of this movie is the character of Derek. As much as we may have hated him at the beginning from all his racist thoughts, acts and violence against stranger but even his family, we cannot help but forgive his mistakes when he comes around at the end and try to make up for what he has done. Indeed, the intelligence of the character serving an awful purpose at the beginning comes eventually to his rescue and to the rescue of his family. This evolution is the greatest thing to witness and gives us an inexplicable joy. This is such a success thanks to the talent of Edward Norton, able to embody and incarnate really both sides of this character so well.<br/><br/>Tony Kaye decided to build the movie based on flashback from the time the father was still alive, to make us understand how racism developed, rooted and almost destroyed this family. All the scenes from the past are in black and white, as if the director wanted to give us a hint on the end of the movie,saying ""this time is over, things have changed now"".<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is captivating and surprising mostly because it does not have the same approach as most racism criticizing movies. It is not a judgmental view of racism here, even though it is still described as horrendous and unacceptable. Indeed, the director chose to show us more how can racism be accepted and defended in the context in which the family is living and how one's judgment can be obscured by the common vision you have to share when part of a group or gang like they are.<br/><br/>Final word, this film is to be seen absolutely, but brace yourself, you are going to be startled and even shocked sometimes; it is part of the charm of American History X."
"Marc_Israel_365","6","0","3","14 May 2014"," The script fails the message despite the visual success
","If you want to show the effects of hatred within the family, you can't make the argument more stronger in defense of racism. A dinner table rant was more powerful in defending our reformed skin heads' view of the results of liberal government than was the quiet shaking of the head by the true adults. You also can't write below your audiences' level and cover it up with a diatribe just because it is raw and brutal. This contrived plot uses an artificial good guy (black teacher) and an impossible good guy (older brother who, three years prior, curb stomped a black car thief he had already shot numerous times) to oppose the beach side community of hate. When tackling the Grand Canyon of social issues in Racism, you better understand your audience who knows that it takes an army of time and thoughtfulness to change mob mentality. While the visuals are at times powerfully shocking and scary, the ending comes short of saying ""why bother"", which is my opinion about the film experience."
"AxelPetersson","9","0","1","13 May 2014"," Understand the morale before the violence
","Although extremely violent, with images that become imprinted on the inside of your skull, I believe the morale behind this movie prevails. Tony Kaye sure left the audience appalled during the credits in 1998 and still continues to, even today. I am full aware that this movie is shown in high schools all over the world with the message of Tony Kaye still living on. This movie needs to be seen by everyone who may and if you show it to someone who has never seen it, it will surely not disappoint. It makes you contemplate the power of ignorance, the power of brotherhood, and the immense power of love towards a family. What is also interesting about the movie is that it is bringing up something that is still relevant today. White extremists are thought of as a minor group in any community but that doesn't change the fact that they still exist. In Sweden for example, fascists and white power-based parties are growing like never before since ww2 and so is political violence. It is still going on and that is why this movie is so important to watch and understand the morale before the violence."

"Leofwine_draca","8","0","2","31 January 2013"," Gutsy and compelling
","American History X is a real surprise, a searing look at racism in America today, told from the point of view of members of a skinhead gang. It's a lengthy film that's punctuated with moments of unflinching brutality, and yet it keeps you hooked to the screen throughout. And the reason for that? Edward Norton. Norton burns up the screen in this film; he's even better than he was in FIGHT CLUB, his big break-out picture. He somehow makes his Neo-Nazi character frightening, compelling and sympathetic in equal measure, a fully realised human being rather than a caricature. Furlong isn't bad, and supporting players like Gould and Keach are great, but let's not kid ourselves here. This is Norton's movie, and he owns it.<br/><br/>This film works well because it isn't judgemental in the slightest. It presents all the sides of a situation without ever TAKING sides. It refuses to preach to the viewer, too, which is something to be commended. It gradually draws you into the plot, and for once the many and lengthy flashbacks are more interesting than the present-time story; the prison flashbacks are among the most powerful I've seen presented. It's not quite a perfect film - I'm not too sure about that ending, when it comes down to it, it feels forced and disconnected from the rest of the movie - but it's certainly up there with the best that Hollywood had to offer during the 1990s."
"illbebackreviews","9","0","1","27 January 2013"," 'American History X' is a superbly acted, rich and emotional story that is sure to leave everyone happy and sad at the end
","As part of my challenge to see all the movies on IMDb's Top 250, I randomly decided to check out 'American History X' which is a movie I've been rather interested in seeing. Going into the movie, I wasn't sure if this would be a good movie or a bad movie or simply just a little disappointing. I had no clue what to expect. I can say, as the first scene ended, I had a huge smile on my face and was soaked into the movie.<br/><br/>American History X is the tale of two brothers, Derek and Danny Vinyard. Derek Vinyard is the leader of a street gang who attempt to bring equality amongst the black and white people as well as dominating over them. Sent to jail, his younger brother Danny becomes much like him and so, Derek must try to stop his brother from following his trails. Despite that being the plot of the movie, this story is far more deeper in every way. I cared so much about Derek Vinyard as well as his brother Danny. The way the director made Derek both a criminal trying to simply achieve justice amongst the two races as well as such a caring brother and son to the family was what made him such a great character. You could tell that he simply didn't want his brother to become the person he did. The director did a fantastic job giving such a rich history to these two characters.<br/><br/>The acting in the movie by Edward Norton is probably his best performance, yes I enjoy this performance more than Fight Club. He was absolutely fantastic stealing scene after scene he was in, which is pretty much the whole movie. Edward Furlong, John Connor from Terminator 2, does an absolute fine job playing his younger brother. I do not care what people say, Furlong is a good actor.<br/><br/>The cinematography in the movie is far superior to most movies that came around during that time. The idea of black and white for past events was clever and easily helps you understand the movie and the two are easily distinguished. The music in the movie is very good, but of course, in this type of movie, the soundtrack isn't important. For a drama to succeed, the characters and story have to be interesting, and this film easily accomplishes that.<br/><br/>During the movie, I kept guessing what would be the next thing to happen but every time I was surprised at the way the director took this movie. The film is just under two hours, but seriously, this movie felt a good half hour shorter. This happens when you love a movie.<br/><br/>***SPOILERS*** The way American History X ended with Danny being shot in the school bathroom was shocking. It was simply that sad due to the performance that Furlong gave and the character's developed story. The way it ended with Danny narrating how the two races weren't supposed to ever fight but to be friends to each other was perhaps one of the finest endings to a movie ever. Seeing Derek mourn for the loss of his brother was shocking.<br/><br/>****ENDING SPOILERS*** Overall, to sum it up, American History X is definitely a must see movie for movie fans however isn't recommended to those under the age of 13 due to the racism in this movie. That being said, those who haven't seen this movie, please do so now as you will be pleasantly surprised and how good this movie exactly is. If you don't see it, its your own personal loss..."

","American History X tells the story of Derek Vinyard, a vile, racist, murderous neo-Nazi skinhead who decides he doesn't want to be that guy anymore. But he will find that once you are living that life it is not at all easy to get out. And much to Derek's chagrin he sees his brother Danny going down the same path which nearly destroyed him. Derek knows he has to reach Danny, change him, open his eyes. Before it's too late.<br/><br/>The film's story unfolds in an unconventional manner. We see the present-day Derek, a man determined to do good, to change himself and save his brother. This is intercut with flashbacks which show us the monster Derek was. When the film opens Derek is about to be released from prison. When we go back in time to see how he ended up in jail it is shocking and disturbing to say the least. We see a man consumed by hatred and anger. He tears his family apart. He destroys his own life. And he does it all with a sinister smirk on his face. The saddest thing is that Danny idolizes his older brother. Danny is a skinhead too, proud of it. There was a time Derek would have been proud of what Danny had become. That time has gone. Prison changed Derek. How exactly it changed him is told in quite vivid, brutal detail. And when it becomes clear who it was who eventually reached Derek, changed his way of thinking, it all begins to make sense. The path to Danny's salvation appears. There is only one person who was ever really going to be able to change Danny and that was his brother. But Derek had someone very important on his side to help things along. That help had better come quickly. Danny may be too far gone, time is running out.<br/><br/>It's a captivating film with an undeniably powerful story. But it's not a film without flaws. While Edward Norton is magnificent as Derek there's the sense Edward Furlong, playing Danny, struggles to keep pace. When Norton and Furlong share the screen, and they share the film's most important moments, there's the sense that Furlong just doesn't measure up. There's a certain level of maturity required to handle the very challenging role and Furlong seems to lack it. There are times it's hard to take his character seriously and that's a problem in a film as deadly serious as this one. The film also has a bit of a disjointed feel to it. The nonlinear structure works but not all of the pieces really end up fitting properly. This probably has something to do with the fact the film was taken out of director Tony Kaye's hands and reassembled by others, most notably Norton. There are places where the narrative just doesn't flow freely, the film bogs down. Kaye has said he wanted to make a tighter, shorter film. It probably would have been better if he had gotten that opportunity. The film also does a rather poor job of establishing the roots of Derek's hatred. One flashback dinner conversation with his father is all we really get and that sequence doesn't really work. It's as if it had to be tossed in because there had to be something there at the root of all this. But it's not enough. And then Derek's prison transformation, again not entirely convincing. You don't let go of that much hatred that quickly.<br/><br/>In one of his earlier racial diatribes Derek had invoked Rodney King, the man who famously asked, ""Can we all get along?"" The old Derek thought Rodney King was some kind of subhuman, the scum of the earth. The new Derek wants us all to get along. But we can't. Some of us have gone too far down the path of hatred and bigotry. You may want to change yourself. But it's hard to change the world. Derek wants to leave his old life behind. More importantly, he wants his brother to leave that world of hate behind. The clock ticks. Time is not on Derek's side."

","As a wise person once said (a long time ago): 'Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.' This proves all too true for Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton), whose fear, frustration and rage at the murder of his father by a black gang member twists his soul, taking him not to the dark side, but to the white side—a neo-nazi gang called The Disciples of Christ—where his extremist beliefs and violent ways earn the respect of his peers, but only bring him and his family further pain and torment.<br/><br/>Redemption for Derek comes during a stint in prison, his three year sentence for killing two black men giving him plenty of opportunity to realise the flaws in his philosophy and the error of his ways; with help from his African-American high school teacher Mr. Sweeney (Avery Brooks), Derek achieves parole and endeavours to make amends for previous actions, rejecting his right-wing lifestyle and those who endorsed it. But will it be enough to save his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlobg) from making the same mistakes as he did?<br/><br/>It's kind of fitting that, for such a film—one so focused on turmoil, struggle and radical beliefs—American History X is the result of an extremely troubled background itself, director Tony Kaye attempting to disown the final film after star Ed Norton saw fit to re-cut the film against his wishes. Amazingly, somehow, the finished film bears no signs of its tumultuous past, being a nigh on perfect study of the cyclical nature of bigotry, one that powerfully drives home the futility of blind hatred.<br/><br/>Boasting many a brilliant performance, wonderful cinematography, smart editing throughout (Norton must've known what he was doing), and some almost poetic acts of violence, plus a powerful message at its heart, this is must-see cinema that makes the viewer think long and hard about what they have witnessed long after the shocking climax has faded from the screen."
"aaditya-swaroop","9","0","1","18 November 2012"," Edward Norton Classic
","Powerful, hard hitting, provoking, touching. AMX is truly a classic on a controversial social theme. It is one of those movies where the viewer is left stunned when the end credits start rolling and it takes a moment for him to realize that he just viewed a good work of cinema. Though many movies try, but very few leave such an impact on its audience. AMX has this quality.<br/><br/>For me, three things stood out in this movie - Direction by Tony Kaye, dialogues (written by David McKenna) and above all, Edward Norton's portrayal of Derek Vinyard. <br/><br/>Tony Kaye has been known to come out with work on social themes, his other known work being a documentary on abortion debate, Lake of fire (2006). Through AMX, Tony has depicted the impact of the black-white divide in a very impactful manner. His depiction of the struggle that the youth go through and the impact on their impressionable minds is spot on. But more importantly, he was able to convey the message by building up a story which conveys the impact of this racial hatred on the vineyard family - father's killing, Derek's violence, Danny's death. The sequence of events could have been done sequentially without any voice-over. But having this told by Danny's voice with flashbacks made the story more honest and real. Derek's character transformation inside prison made sense and was not random. Tony was himself the director of photography for AMX. He made sure that the shots which needed impact were done differently - slow motion, face shots. <br/><br/>The story/screenplay is by David McKenna. Since there was no credits given separately for dialogues, am assuming David wrote the dialogues as well. Unlike other movies handling the same theme, I found the dialogues of AMX were much more though provoking & amazingly articulate. The dialogues weren't just swearing and shouting obscenities - they had meaning and made the viewer understand how clear the character's thought process was. This was amply displayed multiple times - Derek's speech to his gang before they busted the departmental store or the lunch table conversation. The same clarity wasn't showed for Danny's character and rightly so - he was simply confused whether to follow his brother's footsteps or be the good family kid.<br/><br/>Tony's and Danny's work would have been unreal had Edward Norton not brought Derek's character to life. I would rate this as one of Edward Norton's classic (along with Fight Club). He powerfully portrayed Derek's pre-prison character as an intellectual youth misguided by neo- nazi propaganda. The extremities of his youthful obsession came out beautifully when the cops arrest Derek for the killing of two black youths, but all he does is smile. There is a look of triumph on his face, a sense of pride. Pure hatred, no regret. <br/><br/>Overall, AMX is a thought provoking work of cinema which is well written, nicely directed and brought to life by one of the best actors of our generation, Norton. I rate this movie 8.5 out of 10."

It helps to know a little bit about the world history and not be close minded to things that actually happened. The characters are just so rightfully played and the voice of derek when he tells how things are and gives you a glimpse of things that are going on, wow! it just puts the whole situation into perspective, he is seems so calm and collected and such a little guy but really he has a huge heart and a point to make. I have cried, laughed and been a little dismayed with parts of this movie, but never would i ever not watch it.

"dunham14","8","0","1","16 September 2012"," ""American History X"", Ton y Kaye out does himself with his portrayal of racism in Los Angeles CA . Told through the eyes of Derek and Daniel Vinyard
","""American History X"", a 1998 film by Tony Kaye, starring Edward Norton as Derek Vineyard, Edward Furlong as Daniel Vineyard, and Beverly D'Angelo as Doris Vineyard. The story is about two brothers growing up in Los Angeles, CA. Their father was murdered by a black drug dealer while fighting a fire in a South Central LA neighborhood. This leads to the racist tone of the movie and to Dereks hatred.<br/><br/>The main theme in the movie is racism and the effects that it has on different groups of people. This can be seen throughout many of the scenes in the movie, one scene in particular was in the beginning when we are introduced to Derek who is seen bashing a black man's face against the curb for trying to steal from his truck. Derek is subsequently sent to prison where he finds out that being a white neo-nazi supremacist is not everything he use to think it was. Upon entering prison Derek shows off his swastika tattoo hoping to gain support and protection from other inmates that thought the way he did. This however is not the way it worked out for him. When Derek is finally released from prison he is a changed man, he no longer wants to have all the hate that he has carried with him for years and he doesn't want his little brother Daniel to follow in his footsteps. Another scene were the theme can really be seen is when Doris has a Jewish friend over for dinner, Derek cannot stand the fact that his mother has a Jewish friend and verbally abuses him and then throws him out of his house.<br/><br/>In relation to the theme, ""Crash"" is another movie that shows a lot of the same racist tendencies. Both movies are set in Los Angeles, CA and almost draw on the natural tensions that come from that area.<br/><br/>One technique that was used throughout the movie that I thought added a lot to the movie was the interchanging from color to black and white. Although most of the movie was in color the flashbacks that were used to depict portions of Derek's younger days were shown in black and white. I felt this did a good job of displaying the tensions and extreme hatred that Derek had at that time in his life by showing it in black and white, it gave the scene a different feel than the rest of the movie. Symbolism was also used throughout the movie. Derek showed off his swastika tattoo in prison to show his beliefs and with the hopes of finding others like him. The swastika can also be seen at the white supremacist rally. There are flags hanging in the barn and in Cameron Alexander the leader of the D.O.C.'s office along with pictures of nazi Germany. The music that is playing at the rally also adds to the theme of the movie."
"patton16","8","0","1","10 September 2012"," The journey of one white supremacists through some life-changing events and the impact they have on his life and those around him.
","American History X is a film that brings out the ugly side of prejudice and white supremacy. The name of the film comes from Danny's principal who asks him to write a paper on his brother Derek's lifestyle as a white supremacist. Derek is the gang leader of the supremacist group in his town and always seems proud to show off the swastika tattoo on his chest.<br/><br/>I believe the theme of this film is how racism and white supremacy affect a society and how people can change their views by learning more about one another. For Derek, this change does not come easy, and as you find out at the end of the film, it does not come in time either.<br/><br/>In the beginning of the film you see Derek killing several colored men who are breaking into his vehicle in the middle of the night. Derek is arrested and forced to serve time in prison. There he quickly finds others that believe and follow the white supremacy beliefs. He believes this group can help protect him from the black and Hispanic prisoners. He later finds out that this group is actually ""paying"" a colored group to keep them safe and he decides he does not want anything to do with them. The white group feels betrayed by him and becomes even more furious when he begins chatting with a colored man. This man is Lamont, who Derek works in the laundry room with at the prison. The white group ends up raping Derek the shower room. This is a real turning point for Derek as he is shamed by his own kind. He realizes the white supremacy beliefs are not the way he wants to continue to live his life.<br/><br/>Derek ends up leaving jail as a new man, with new beliefs, but in the same world as he left it. He sees his brother, Danny, following in his footsteps and treating the colored folks in town the same way he used to. Derek is finally able to change his brother's views after he shares all he experienced in prison. Unfortunately, it is too late as Danny is shot at the end of the movie by a colored man in a restroom.<br/><br/>One film American History X reminds me of is Once Upon a Time in America. This film is similar in the fact that a ganger is forced to return to an old life he had years ago and deal with the issues he left behind. This is similar to what Derek went through upon his release from jail.<br/><br/>A couple of film techniques stood out to me while viewing this film. The first was black and white vs. color. The film was shot in color with the exception of many scenes which flashed back to different times in Derek's life. All of the bad memories were done in black and white, but the one happy scene at the end remained in color. This one flashback in color was of Derek and Danny running on the beach playing as young boys. The use of black and white in this film makes all the bad memories on Derek's life stand out.<br/><br/>The other notable technique used in this film was the use of symbols. The large swastika tattooed on Derek's chest was a mark of white supremacy. This was shown in many scenes throughout the movie when he wanted to show the world his position on racism. At the end of the film, after he has changed his views, you see him touching and looking at it like he wants to get rid of it.<br/><br/>I thought American History X was a great movie. It tackled the hard issues of racism and hatred and showed how people can change their thoughts when they get to really know each other."

Having watched Romper Stomper a few days back and reading its reviews, I was reminded of American History X's predictable plot. So I decided to watch it yesterday and prove myself right.. I was in error! This movie blew me away! I was watching it for all the wrong reasons, trying to compare it to a movie (Romper Stomper) that was very different from this one and in a league of its own.

I'd like to know, but I guess it keeps the audience on a slight cliff hanger. It's just annoying that he basically died for his brother. I thought that the slow motion shots in the film were good and the use of black and white photography on different shots was interesting, however sometimes I felt it was done too much in the film, that I noticed it.

","Evocative and controversial film deals with a neo-Nazi (Norton) whose life spirals out of control when he's incarcerated for his crimes, and discovers that the road to redemption is not going to be without collisions, irrespective of his contrition and new found respect. Furlong, as his kid brother, idolises Norton and follows him into the false promise of hatred, only to find he's been led astray and faces an even more arduous return from the brink, if he gets that opportunity.<br/><br/>Some interesting commentary concerning the seemingly innocuous origins of racism, how it incubates through adversity and is then practiced by naivety; a condition to be pitied rather than to fuel reverse hatred. Norton is perhaps too accomplished for the material he's given, because despite the film's sombre tone, it's still clichéd and pretty simplistic in its resolutions. <br/><br/>There's plenty of shock value in the beatings and sodomy on offer, but in my opinion, these are milestones in a weak plot that's only vying for conventional pathos. Not strictly the same angle, but I thought ""Romper Stomper"" was a more atmospheric and seemingly realistic portrayal of the neo-Nazi lifestyle in modern society, sans the Hollywood gloss."

","This movie is an amazing film. The usage of black and white, violence, and flashbacks makes the film very realistic. It has a huge ability to change people's minds about the serious social problem of racism. This movie did a good job of tying the whole entire purpose of the movie with a quotation of Abraham Lincoln's first inaugural address: ""We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory will swell when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature."" This movie contains a very important message that can be used here in the world today about racism. This film will touch people's hearts, even though, skin color was smeared with a title: unaccepted. American History X will help people find acceptance in their hearts that we are all equal and human, and hate never solves any type of tolerance. Overall, I highly recommend this movie. It is an eye opener. Left me breathless and it touched my heart. I give it two thumbs up."

","The interesting title of this movie supposedly comes from the teacher in the school (Dr Sweeney) who tells his student (Danny) to write an account of his life especially in regard to his relationship with his brother who is a Neo-Nazi Skinhead whom he idolizes and wants to follow in his footsteps. The teacher is telling Danny not to be stuck in the past of others who have made the same disastrous choices but to find for himself whether he is capable of thinking on his own rather than follow the logic and rhetoric of a gang of bigoted Nazis. By writing out his own story, Danny first revisits his past, and finally discovers through the experiences of his brother in prison that indeed he has only been following the prejudiced logic of others, a logic that is fortified into an emotional frenzy of hatred by the archaic rhetoric of people like Hitler, and in this process they have become mere pawns in a game of domination that seems to go on eternally. The whole point of the movie is that this game of domination is a lose-lose game of false or illusory honor or pride in which even the 'king' is eventually forced to commit 'hara-kiri', whereas the pawns, whether on the side of the oppressor or the side of the oppressed who react violently, are either slaughtered or lead a foolish, meaningless life of subservience or futile violent reprisals in which they keep repeating the same mistakes over and over again, learning nothing from their past. So American History with the suffix X (symbolizing the unknown – that is, capable of being reinterpreted without racial prejudice) is the attempt to breakout of this vicious power game, so that something valuable can be learned from History, rather than be trapped in it. The X is also a sort of tribute to Malcolm X who renounced his racism against whites and said that the problem of race was not merely an American problem but a world problem – a problem of humanity (Dr Sweeney's story about dealing with the problem is quite similar to that of Malcolm X's transformation of attitude). This movie is an attempt to deal with this problem by pointing out that this must be dealt with fore-mostly in the educational institutions and that the teachers have a crucial role in this. If this issue is not dealt with at the school level, then it becomes extremely difficult to correct at the later stage of an individual's life as there are no existing institutions that deal with this issue of reforming racial prejudices and attitudes. The turning point in the movie comes when Dr Sweeney posits the key question regarding the problem: ""I didn't get no answers because I was asking the wrong questions. You have to ask the right questions – has anything you have done made your life better?"" Yes, everything depends upon the questions that you put to yourself and then honestly try to answer those for your own sake. A near perfect acting by all the leading cast, excellent editing and well researched script that presents all the main arguments on this issue concisely makes this must-watch movie, especially for young people in schools."

","In American History X, Derek Vineyard (played by Edward Norton) is a self proclaimed Neo-Nazi (skin head) and a leader of a gang, fostered by a preacher of hate, Cameron Alexander (Stacy Keach). Alexander, who uses impressionable kids but stays behind the scenes to keep himself out of trouble, teaches hatred of anyone that is a minority and further pushes Derek into believing in white supremacy and uses Derek's skills and intelligence to help spread his word of hate. Thanks to his intelligence and skills in speaking, others follow Derek in terrorizing anyone who is not white as shown when Derek and other skinheads go into the Korean grocery store. Derek's first hint of racism came from his father, who was killed in the line of duty by a minority. This is where Derek began to have hatred for all minorities and was able to be easily influenced by the likes of Alexander. Derek has a younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) that idolizes him and wants to emulate him, and his mother Doris (Beverly D'Angelo) and sister Davin (Jennifer Lien) who both are afraid of Derek but are also afraid of the life he has chosen and where that choice will take him. This theme of violence is not unlike the one shown by the Hmong gang that was terrorizing the community in Detroit in the film Gran Torino (Eastwood, 2008). After Derek was sentenced to prison for happily murdering two black youths that was breaking into his vehicle, things for Derek changed. While serving his sentence, he learned that there are good and bad people of every race and his view of others unlike himself have changed. Upon his release from prison, Derek must pull his younger brother from the mire of hatred that he once embraced. This feeling of hate and racism is one of the primary themes in the movie, and the easiest for the viewer to understand. Racism and hatred are both powerfully shown in this film but it ends with the enlightenment of Derek that what he has done in the past, and where his brother Danny is heading in the future, is wrong. There were many techniques used to show the power of the scenes. From using flashbacks to show what happened in the past to change Derek both negatively and positively, and the narration of the film by Danny, it all helped to tell the story the director wished the viewer to see. Plot points that supported the theme of violence and racism included the symbol of the Nazi swastika on Derek's chest. In the beginning, he wore that tattoo with pride but after maturing and becoming enlightened in prison, he wore it with shame. Camera angles were such that fear of the gang was shown by those that were terrorized by them and probably one of the most powerful was showing the violence of Derek killing the two men. <br/><br/>American History X shows that there are consequences to the actions one takes and that enlightenment comes at a cost. For Derek, that cost was the time he spent in prison and what happened to him there."

","Wow. Simply wow. such a great movie,such a strong theme. Wow. I saw the movie yesterday and I knew I'm going to watch a virulent, brutal movie ,but I did not expect to see one of the greatest film I have ever saw. First of all, Edward Norton and Edward Furlong. Maybe the best acting I saw, they truly made me think they are neo-Nazi. Norton is playing Derek Vinyard, neo-Nazi who lead a gang of white people, who believe that the white men belong to the 'Aryan' trunk and the others belong to the 'Semitic' trunk, lower trunk. After Derek left the prison, he understood that his life attitude was wrong, and trying to change his brother's attitude before it is too late. As a Jew, I know that there is still Nazism out there, and this movie is a proof that I right. Do not waste your time about other movies, just go and see this one. I'm sure you will be glad . 10/10"
"addiewhiz","7","0","1","23 April 2012"," Edward Norton is the saving grace for this film
","On my gallant, noble, and impossible quest to see every movie that has ever been deemed to be good, I happened on the title American History X. It was indeed a good film, but that's just it. It was only a good film. It did not give me chills or astound me like many of the other great films that I have seen.<br/><br/>The most wonderful aspect of this film was the acting. When I heard what the film was about, and that Edward Norton was going to play the raving Neo-Nazi brother Derek Vinyard, I was initially disappointed, due to Norton's style of largely plain and deadpan delivery. I didn't think he had it in him to play a raving, deluded racist. I am glad to say that Norton's performance proved me very wrong. The way in which he delivered his lines was so convincing, that I actually experienced some amount of anger at his character, and not just the ideas he espoused. The convoluted logic behind his racism was so thought out and realistic, that it made it very easy to see how people who hold racial prejudices come to hold them. In addition, Ethan Suplee demonstrated impressive versatility in his acting. The first time I saw Suplee in a film was in Remember the Titans, where he played the slightly comical offensive lineman Louie Lastik. His character in this film, Seth, was incredibly dark, singing his White Supremacist songs and saluting Hitler. In general, the acting absolutely blew me away.<br/><br/>The downside to this movie is that the plot sets itself up for much depth in the story, but never takes the dive. In the beginning, Danny's teacher tells Danny that he will be a part of a new class, called American History X, designed to prevent him from going down the same Nazi path as his older brother. This is the title of the film. I think it's fair to expect the film to go into significant depth as to what the substance of the class is, and what Danny would have been learning in the class. But, because of the nature of the film, we never find out. I'm not saying that the film should be changed. I'm just saying that the writers of the film should have made it such that Danny was just given an extra assignment by his teacher, as opposed to having an entirely new course constructed for him.<br/><br/>Another aspect that goes undeveloped is the nature of the character, Lamont, who is Derek's Black friend in prison. Lamont is largely responsible for Derek's epiphany that Black people are, in fact, treated unfairly by law enforcement, and further more that racial hatred is a wasteful way of life. With such an important role in the story, one would think that Lamont's character would have been better explained. Instead, we never learn anything about him, other than the reason that he is in prison.<br/><br/>Another large missing link in this story is the reason for Derek's racism. In Danny's paper, he writes that Derek claims his racism was rooted in his father's murder. Danny claims to believe that his hatred for non-Whites began at an earlier age, when his father told him about affirmative action policies. The film introduces this question, which seems to be a large and significant question, but really only spends about five minutes answering it.<br/><br/>The final large missing puzzle piece, which is a problem that is slightly difficult to solve it whether or not Derek reverts to a life of racism at the end of the film. Not to spoil the film completely, but something happens to Danny at the very end of the film that would force Derek to question what he had learned from his experiences in prison. But, the film simply leaves us hanging there. We do not know whether we should feel happy or sad, for Derek, at the end of this film, when we feel the need to feel some sort of emotion in that regard. There really isn't a way to solve this problem, but it is worth noting.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a good film, with excellent character portrayal. However, it definitely leaves some questions unanswered."

","I cannot recall having seen a film in which the two leading actors deliver such stunning performances as those given by the two Edwards - Norton and Furlong - in this powerful but often bleak and brutal movie. I simply cannot understand why neither seems to have won a major award for his portrayal. The film itself is not quite of the same quality as its leading performances. But it is nonetheless a frequently riveting and thought-provoking watch.<br/><br/>""American History X"" tells the story of the problems of racism and neo-Nazism in modern-day Los Angeles. Derek Vinyard (Norton) is a young white working-class man who spends three years in prison for the manslaughter of two black men whom he killed violently when they tried to break into his car in the middle of the night. At that time, Derek was the leader of a local skinhead gang that promotes and supports white supremacy. While serving his prison sentence, Derek undergoes a philosophical conversion. He leaves the penitentiary with radically different ideas and is determined to put his past racism behind him and to move on. That, though, proves to be not an easy task. And, while Derek was in prison, his younger brother Danny (Furlong), who was also a racist skinhead, was on the horns of a dilemma. He found himself torn between an attachment to the ideas of his black high-school principal and those of a local neo-nazi leader. <br/><br/>""American History X"" is a very good film. The difficulties that Derek faces in trying to turn his life around and those experienced by his brother in deciding whether to hunt with the pack (the neo-Nazis) or to plough his own more responsible furrow are very effectively portrayed. The film contains a number of very powerful scenes, not least the one in which Derek kills one of the car thieves. Despite its horrific nature, it is not gratuitous. What prevents the film from being a great one is that there is an element of preachiness about it. In addition, some of the characters' motivation is rather too simplistic. The film asks us to believe that Derek's racism sprang largely from a homily delivered during a family meal by his father about the evil of positive discrimination on behalf of black people. (Admittedly, the circumstances of his father's death also proved to be a factor.) And I was not convinced that Derek's friendship with a black prisoner and the influence that the latter had on him would have resulted in his reforming his ideas in quite the easy way in which the film suggests. Despite those weaknesses, ""American History X"" is a very good film that is well worth watching. 8/10."

","There is no need to remind you of the dark nature of this story. It's intense and violent throughout; the profanity is perpetually spread. But for those who admire the film, they admire in another angle. This is an interesting film that makes me reflect and inspires the way we think about this society.<br/><br/>American History X is a story depicting a profound relationship between two brothers, and the family as a whole. It is a story about racism, a story of bravery and redemption. It shows the truth: sometimes it takes experiences to see the light, and sometimes it takes time and strength to overcome your past and mistakes. But it is also cruel in a sense, though it is the ultimate truth: even if you try so hard, your mistakes can still haunt you and the ones around you.<br/><br/>Edward Norton shines like a diamond for his performance as the big brother with a dark past who strives to prevent his little brother from walking down the same path. Frankly it's easily one of the most outstanding performances I've ever seen in movies.<br/><br/>This film has depth which one must explore and experience by himself.

","This film American History X, directed by Tony Kaye centers around an individual that was once a neo-Nazi skinhead and how he then has a sudden change on how he thinks about African Americans. The film touches the subject of racial discrimination. It shows how a group of people dislike so passionately a different race. The film features Edward Norton as Derek who tries to keep his brother from making the same mistakes he did. He tries to keep his brother from choosing the same path that he did. Danny which is played by Edward Furlong looks up to his brother and chooses the same path his older brother Derek has chosen. Derek is locked up for killing a couple of African Americans and is absent for a period of time in which his brother gets more involved with the skin heads. While Derek in prison he acquires a different outlook about African American and Caucasian people. He truly has a change of heart through his prison experience. The movie shows black and white and color scenes establish the past and the present. Through the use of this you can better understand the past that Derek had gone through. You can see the type of life that he lived and what his perception of white supremacy.<br/><br/>Kaye used slow motion in a number of scenes to emphasize a dramatic scene. He also used black and white scenes for the audience to distinguish the past from the present. These were important factors to the film. They kept the audience nailed to the scene waiting to see what was going to happen next. The flashbacks were portrayed through the use of black and white. They were Derek's previous actions and his way of thinking before. This flashbacks show how Derek was brought up to be a neo-Nazi. The present is shown through the use of color and how Derek's way of thinking has changed.<br/><br/>The theme is how racial discrimination can affect a person's way of thinking. It shows how a person can manipulate someone else's way of thinking and lead them to hate other people that are not the same color skin."

He soon finds himself in prison for killing two black men caught breaking into his truck. During his prison time, he begins to question his prejudices as he makes friends with a black man named Lamont (Guy Torry). Once released from prison, he dedicates himself to convincing his younger brother Danny Vinyard (Edward Furlong) that being a part of a supremacist group is wrong. The story attempts to show how being a part of a supremacist group can brainwash someone into unbelievable hatred for a person based on their color of skin. The unbelievable change that Derek makes in prison is hard to accept from his friends and family. He is soon cast out of the group and finds himself alone. Danny is described as a brilliant teenager that has been led down the wrong path in life. The principle in the school, Dr. Bob Sweeney (Avery Brooks) takes it upon himself to attempt to identify why Danny feels the way he does. Before Danny is able to show that he is changing, a tragic event unfolds. This movie has a strange similarity to the film Gran Torino. Both movies touch on a specific person that has years of hatred and prejudice for other races. The relationships developed from both main characters to people of other races shows that feelings can be changed and friendships made. In each of these movies, death represents what the cost of prejudice can be. Main characters in each of these movies die as a result of an unfortunate hatred. There were recurring ideas (motifs) throughout both movies. The indescribable prejudice that one person can have and their ability to see what is right and overcome that feeling. Many close up angles throughout the films attempt to show emotion and feeling without necessarily having dialogue. In American History X, there were many ""skinheads"" that displayed Nazi symbols in the form of tattoos and flags to represent their outspoken prejudices. In Gran Torino, the constant derogatory language that was used displayed the same emotion. American History X was an interesting look at a life many people do not live. The ability to understand why someone would have such hatred is shown in a way that the viewer would relate to. The underlying theme is the ability to overcome a life of hatred and see that we are all created equal."

","Edward Norton commands his role with truly impressive acting. I've been a big Edward Norton fan since his debut in primal fear but this topped it all. What I loved most about this film is that no matter what your beliefs are when it comes to race and politics, it makes you think deeply about the beliefs opposing yours. I'm not saying that it made me consider neo nazism, but Derek's speech before the attack on the grocery store has valid points on the subject of Americans on welfare. But enough of the politics. This movie makes me wish that Edward Furlong would've continued to do great movies like this instead of playing cameos in less than impressive Seth Rogen/super hero movies. The character of Derek is actually based on a real person and his evolution out of the white supremacist idealism and the film truly sheds light on (sadly) a case in America these days.

","The film, American History X, written by David McKenna, is about a young man who goes from being a skinhead, Neo-Nazi supremacist to attempting to save his brother from following down the same path of destruction. After the death of his father by a black drug-dealer, Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) finds himself proactive in a Neo-Nazi gang led by Cameron Alexander (Stacy Keach) and right next to him is his girlfriend Stacey (Fairuza Balk). One evening Derek's younger brother Danny Vinyard (Edward Furlong) alerts Derek that some black guys were trying to break into his vehicle. Derek darts outside shooting a gun, killing one of them and forcing another to ""bite the curb"" where he kills him as well. As Danny looks on, his brother is arrested, charged, and sentenced to three years in prison. Derek learns in prison that he was wrong in believing and acting the way he did when he leaves the safety of the gang in prison he joined and befriended a black man Lamont (Guy Torry). Danny is following in his brother's footsteps by: joining the same gang, writing papers such as Mein Kampf, and openly being a skinhead, Neo-Nazi supremacist. Dr. Bob Sweeney (Avery Brooks) from Danny's school visits Derek in prison to inform him that Danny is following in his footsteps. When Derek gets out of prison, he tries everything he can to reach out to Danny to make his see what he did was wrong and it's not something to be proud of. Once he gets through to Danny and they both vow to stay away from that kind of evil, Danny gets killed in the bathroom by a black man he had an argument with earlier in the film. The theme of this film is the ability to change oneself. Throughout the film there are flashbacks from Danny's point of view as well as Derek's when he is in prison. The story shows how events that happen in a person's life can ultimately change how they view themselves enough to change who they are when they realize that reflection they are looking at every day is not the person they want to be. With the theme in mind another film that I feel shows how people can change and view life in a different was is ""The Shawshank Redemption"" where two men who are in prison for different crimes learn that friendship and kindness can make life so much more worthwhile. The lighting, color, and angles used throughout the film helped to captivate the audience. When there were flashbacks the use of black and white was amazing to show the overall difference between past and present. The angle used when Derek was being arrested was to make sure the audience not only saw the outcome, but ultimately see the expression on Derek's face when he was looking at Danny and smiling. That was the last memory Danny had of him outside of prison. When addressing the theme on changing oneself, sometimes it takes a person to step back and look at how things were when there was happiness and innocence. One scene was where Derek is looking in the mirror and thinks about when he and Danny were very young. To that point he realizes how much pain he has caused many people around him, and what needs to be done in hopes to fix what he continued from the hatred his father taught him."

","When I first heard of ""American History X,"" I thought it was going to be ""just another movie."" Man, was I wrong! The first time I watched it, I sat there as it ended, and I was just completely in a state of shock. This movie, more than any other movie I had seen on the subject of racism, really made me think twice about how I treated people of a different race. The way that Derek Vinyard's family was almost completely split apart and destroyed due to his racist beliefs should be a wake-up call to those people who have any racist beliefs whatsoever. I believe that this movie was a whole lot more than just a ground-breaking, controversial drama; it was a portrayal of exactly how much damage can be done to a family and a nation simply because of the hate for a person or people of a different color, for almost no reason at all. The Bible says that ""God created man in his own image."" It also says to, ""Love your neighbor as yourself,"" which, right there, implies that racism is not something people should even consider. I wouldn't recommend that anyone under the age of 16 see this movie due to its graphic content and language; however, I believe that everyone who is over the age of 16, should see this movie at least once. This way, more people will get a chance to see the true consequences of racism, and how it can easily tear apart a family."

","It's hard to know what to expect going into American History X. It's not the most approachable or accessible film, and it deals with particularly dark subject matter that is disturbing and off putting to many viewers. Edward Norton stars as Derek Vinyard, the head of a Neo-Nazi gang. In the film, Derek has just been let out of prison after serving a three year term for murder. When he gets released he comes to realize the error of his ways in the past, and now he is determined to prevent his little brother Danny from making the same mistakes he did. The whole film takes place on the day Derek gets out of jail, but black and white flashbacks dominate about 60-70 percent of the film. Watching his film is a brutal endeavor and I had some issues with it at first, but it all pays off in the end.<br/><br/>American History X has a very strange and offbeat style to it. The cinematography is uniquely nuanced between black and white and color. The film utilizes a lot of camera techniques in strange places, such as the abundance of odd close ups and tilted camera angles. These things are somewhat distracting at times, but they give the whole film an uncomfortable and chaotic atmosphere that really sucks you in. Overall it is indeed an engaging film, possibly because of its oddities.<br/><br/>It's also unique in its verbose screenplay. The film is full of ranting monologues that push the sub textual point of the film a little too heavy and make the film a little simplistic at times. However, it is filled with very poignant dialogue that captivates and compels to a great extent. The racist and hate filled rants that Derek delves into multiple times throughout the movie are extremely shocking as well as fascinating, albeit ridiculous at times. One issue I encountered, however, was the way the script isn't exactly able to differentiate its levels of speech. All the characters talk with the same literacy and dialect, and all with a very similar cadence to their delivery. This fault doesn't make it seem like Derek is the highly intelligent, yet misguided, young man we are led to believe he is. Instead he seems to be at the same level of intelligence as the rest, just with an ounce more charisma. Yet at the core of all its vulgarity and flaws the script is really very intelligent and has a lot to offer in the big picture.<br/><br/>The big picture is an important term to use here because you have to finish all of American History X to get the whole picture. The film makes you think up to the very last shot. When I really thought the film would end up being a disappointment it hit me with a powerful and shocking ending that changed all of what I thought about this film. The film might slip up during the first two acts, but when it all starts to come together towards the end the payoff is unexpectedly brilliant. American History X is well worth the watch. It's not your average run of the mill film and it will challenge your mind to think bigger and it will open your eyes to the bigger and darker world we live in."

","American History X is a film that reminds me that movies can be about something important. Whether its a lesson that we as humankind come away from by the end about treating everyone equally and with respect. In my estimation this film should have won multiple Oscars. I understand why it didn't though. This is a film that shocks you with brutal, and I mean brutal truth. Edward Norton did score an Oscar nomination(HE SHOULD HAVE WON) for playing a vicious Venice Beach skinhead through certain actions ends up in prison and then becomes reformed for his bad deeds. It is so rare that you see an actor completely disappear into a character. For a while you forget that you are watching a movie and just experiencing life on screen. Every nuance that Norton brings to the table is like watching a cascade of fireworks ripping across the sky. Its up there with DeNiro's performance in Raging Bull. (Yes folks he is that good). There are scenes of such intensity with violent words or physical beatings that many people will be unable to look at the screen. Obviously the curbing scene. American History X is a story about family, redemption and of course the legacy of hate. Hate blinds us from its ripple effects and the damage that it causes to so many people. The only other film that comes close to these social issues is Spike Lee's Do The Right Thing. But I think American History X is a better film because there is an ending in this film that just shatters your heart. I first saw this film at 19 and I am 32 now. I keep having different experiences because of my own experiences with racism and hatred. This is a film that sets the bar so high I don't think a film like this from a major studio comes around this often. Do yourself a favor and rent this movie it will change your life, for the better!"

","American History X is a 1998 drama film directed by Tony Kaye, starring Edward Norton and Edward Furlong. The film tells the story of two brothers, Derek Vinyard and Daniel ""Danny"" Vinyard from Venice Beach in Los Angeles, California. They are both smart and charismatic boys. Their father, who was formally a firefighter, was murdered by a black drug dealer while trying to fight a fire in a South Central neighborhood of Los Angeles, and Derek is drawn into this whole neo-Nazi movement. In the movie older brother Derek kills two black gang members who he catches in the act of breaking into the truck left to him by his father, and is sentenced to three years in prison for voluntary manslaughter. The story shows how Danny is influenced by his older brother's actions and mindset and how Derek, now suddenly changed by his experience in prison, which includes a violent rape scene by white inmates.<br/><br/>This is a very controversial film and is bound to spark up a ton of conversation. While watching this film it is best to have an open mind set so that feeling or cultural preferences don't interfere with the point that the movie is trying to make."
"alex703","Null","0","1","13 November 2011"," Powerful and Disturbing Movie
","American History X is a fantastic, disturbing, and moving film about Derek, the leader (or co-leader) of a white supremacist group in Venice Beach, CA. But moving beyond that, it is a movie about equality, about what is fair, about what is right (yeah this review is preachy).<br/><br/>The story is well-told, revealing itself little by little with flashbacks that explain Derek's journey from a promising youth to a white supremacist, and a convict on top of that.<br/><br/>But most people know the good elements of this movie, so I am going to focus mainly on the problems I had with it: 1) Danny's narrator voice. His character wasn't bad, but when he was narrating, I just couldn't help but roll my eyes. It told what the rest of the movie already implied, and that spoiled it a bit.<br/><br/>2) The explanation for Derek becoming racist is too blunt and obvious. It is explained in one flashback to his father telling him not to put up with ""nigger bullshit"". This is a detail that doesn't need to be explained and creates too simple a cause/effect situation when in reality the issue appeared much more complex throughout the movie.<br/><br/>3) After Derek leaves the white supremacist group, we never hear from them again. They are such a powerful force in the first half of the movie that it is odd that they just completely disappear.<br/><br/>However, do not let these criticisms deter you from watching this powerful film. The acting (especially by Edward Norton and, in a smaller role, Elliot Gould) was brilliant, and the ending will leave you with your hand over your mouth in rage and horror. This movie has a clear message: it is not a specific race or ethnicity that is evil, but instead the hate between the races. American History X delivers it, for the most part, superbly."
"ElMaruecan82","7","0","2","11 November 2011"," Starts as a thought-provoking commentary on Racism and ends as a simplistic Anti-racism propaganda ...
","Tony Kaye's ""American History X"" intelligently tackles the subject of violence and racism and how this dangerous dichotomy is deeply rooted in the social injustices and everyday frustrations endured by American people regardless of their skin. But while it raises very thought-provoking interrogations, it fails to come back with meaningful answers.<br/><br/>I concede that the film was brave enough to have a very unsympathetic character as the lead, Edward Norton is brilliant as Derek Vinyard, a young ideologically disoriented man whose level of hatred and violence is defined by his aptitude to kill and a huge chest-tattooed swastika, and the film was even braver to try to depict his 'moral salvation'. But the film's problem is that both his downfall and his redemption are not treated with the same level of intelligence. I couldn't buy it would take only one rape by a gang of Nazi prisoners and a subplot involving the friendship with a black guy working in the laundry, to redeem Derek. How could the movie be so indulgent toward his racism by reducing it to a sickness whose only remedy was 'to see the light'? <br/><br/>If David McKenna's script had the guts to depict one of the most disturbing and shocking (realistic) deaths: the curb-stomping, how did he expect to make a nice guy out of such a despicable character in less than two hours? It took more than three for Spike Lee to make us root for ""Malcolm X"" and he wasn't as cold-blooded and merciless as Derek Vinyard. Intelligence and fast-paced editing are not the most compatible elements for such provocative and promising character studies. Unfortunately, the whole deconstruction of Derek's personality fallaciously shows him more as a victim of racism than the true and condemnable perpetrator of racist acts. And this is a dangerous intellectual shortcut contradicting the idea that we're all determined by acts committed in a responsible way.<br/><br/>And Derek sure the hell knew what he was doing as a skinhead leader, yet the film shows him as a good kid with a good heart who let himself absorbed by racial prejudices as soon as his father was killed by black people... and the movie pretends to display a crucial plot twist through one scene where the prejudices of Derek's father foreshadows his descent into racism. The black-and-white choice for the flash-back sequences is ironically fitting because it features the two sides of Derek Vinyard, when he's too bright for his entourage or too violent, in-between, there's an absence that would have probably provided the right answers, or at least, some hints.<br/><br/>Take for instance the dinner table scene, probably the most gripping and morally challenging of the film : Derek exposes his views with such confidence that we're tempted to root for the core of his ideas (cleared of course from their blatantly racist overtones). At one moment, Elliot Gould, playing a Jewish professor, even speaks about the persecution of Jews with an irrelevance that almost justifies Derek's point about people from any communities raising the 'Antiracism' flag every time they feel offended in order to avoid self-criticism, blocking any attempt of rational discussion. And then, all of a sudden, as to destroy all the interrogations the scene just constructed, Derek acts like a one-dimensional evil thug, concluding in an anti-Semitic rant against Gould, proudly showing his tattoo.<br/><br/>So Derek is not racist with a heart full of anger whose seeds was planted in the field of 'legitimate' frustration, he's just a bright kid who used his charisma and rhetoric to be the spokesman of a Neo-Nazi group. ""American History X"" evokes the manipulative effect of racist theories ignoring that it uses the same rhetoric tricks as the anti-racism : when you can't reply by constructive words, just be offended, and it's made easier when Derek is the offender. I really want to quote Gould asking Derek ""What are you trying to prove?"" That racism is only the way some people choose to ignore their own responsibilities and point their fingers on other communities? That's fine except that this is how anti-racism works too and the whole film is also guilty for having portrayed Derek as a victim of unfortunate circumstances.<br/><br/>Should we be indulgent because he lost his father? Should we consider that he got the lesson just because he was anal-raped by the Nazi-men in jail? Are we supposed to believe that the Hispanic or Black prisoners are such gentleman that they decided to give a break to Derek?? What's with the idolization of Hitler by Daniel Vinyard, Edward Furlong as Derek's younger brother? Only a consequence of his admiration for his older brother? So all it would take to fix it is a sweet debriefing from his brother, and a history paper course with a cool-sounding title. The movie is so judgmental toward 'racism' that it should have the decency to depict the limits of blind and institutionalized anti-racist lobbying; then it would have really been ahead of its time.<br/><br/>And the ending was another example of a manipulative getaway, the dark tunnel with the light of hope, Daniel gets killed by the very black kid he provoked the day before  symbolically, I would have accepted this death as a tragic eye-for-an-eye response to the curb-stomping, but then I'd like to know –and sorry to insist on a technical aspect- why the director didn't shoot that scene again because I'm sorry, Edward Norton, one of the greatest actors of his generation, wasn't convincing. I even spotted some embarrassing moments where he looked like smiling, and that wouldn't have deserved an Oscar.<br/><br/>While it was asking for an unconventional social commentary, with the same intellectual courage as Spike Lee's ""Do The Right Thing"" or ""Malcolm X"", this ""X"" falls in the politically correct trap that inevitably patronizes us through its subliminal 'Racism is bad' message, and the movie didn't deserve that, not after such a promising start anyway."

"vd4477","Null","0","2","1 November 2011"," a movie that shows the learned behavior of racism and Neo-Nazism
","Based on a true story of a former turned Neo-Nazi, American History X (1998) suggests what concerns racism. The movie makes a strong point in the film that no one is ever right and is no one ever wrong concerning racism. The film radiates the theme that racism is a learned behavior which is suggested and reiterated throughout the film. Beginning with the story of two brothers, the oldest named Derek Vinyard played by Academy Award winner for best actor Edward Norton, and his younger brother Danny Vinyard played by Edward Furlong we see the forged footprints pressed into young Danny's mind concerning the taught hatred and racism learned from his father Dennis Vinyard played by William Russ and older brother Derek. The plot is shown through a serious of black and white flashbacks concerning the recent past that have led the young Danny to become a now Neo-Nazi and the events leading up to his older brother Derek's incarceration for killing two young black gang members after attempting to break into his now deceased father's pickup truck. The film scenes shot in color are the proceeding twenty-four hours after Derek is released from prison and the events leading after that.<br/><br/>Throughout the film we watch through a series of black and white flashbacks how Derek became a Neo-Nazi and the events leading up to his incarceration along with his time spent in prison. We also watch Danny (Furlong) grow throughout his High school years with the same Neo-Nazi racist learned mentality thanks to brother Derek's instilled teachings.<br/><br/>Throughout the film, we notice the use of theme being carried on each scene and is presented quite dramatically. Director Tony Kaye makes good use of the dramatic effects produced by black and white filming making certain to show the most dramatic scenes in slow motion and with the use of angling giving the scenes a grim, dark decadent look. Scenes which included , the heinous curb stopping of the young crypt basketball player resulting in Derek murdering him as his brother Danny watches show effective use of the multi angled filming and slow motion to enhance the treachery of the event. Other use of these techniques include the rape and beating of Derek by his own gang (The Aryan Brotherhood) while in prison. Tony Kaye directs each of these scenes as well as others with a clear, concise intended message concerning the manifestation of racism. The scenes are kept dreary and cold, which appears to be intended to visually show the outlook that racism in itself projects. The dark, deeply embedded racist thoughts and for that, direct consequences are highlighted throughout the film in all scenes. With the extensive racist and also Neo-Nazi philosophical dialogue Edward Norton (Derek) brings these misconstrued thoughts to reality.<br/><br/>Two scenes worth mentioning on behalf of Director Tony Kaye are the reiterated dinner tables scenes concerning Derek and Danny's family. In the family dinner scene, we see Doris Vineyard (Beverly D'Angelo) as Doris Vinyard the boys' mother and her husband Dennis. Here we see the first instilled behavior of racist thoughts, when firefighter father Dennis tells Derek that he ""needs to watch and question black ideas, things and persons."" Prior to this Derek has felt no real hatred for other races and it is not until after his father dies trying to fight a fire and save a black drug dealer does Derek take these notions to heart. After concealing his Neo-Nazi we find Derek now the ring leader of a Neo-Nazi street game sitting at the same dinner table in the Vinyard's household, schooling his mother's new Jewish Boyfriend Murray (played by Elliot Gould) on why the Rodney King trial is unacceptable. Throughout this scene we see the same taught behavior being passed from once the father to son, to now the brother to brother as Brother Danny watches the debate between the two. The two dinner scenes pair nicely and coincide with writer David McKenna's overall theme that again racism is a learned behavior.<br/><br/>The one strong ironic character presented in the film which ties the beginning and ending to the films theme is Derek's black school teacher now principal Dr. Robert Sweeney played by Avery Brooks. It seems ironic throughout the film that Derek maintains a level of respect for his past teacher, which shows some light concerning the possibility of change in Derek. Dr. Sweeney can be seen as the hero in this film, for revealing the true Derek to us and helping him change his racist ways, Dr. Sweeney is also responsible for helping Derek do right by attempting to save his brother Danny from the same foreseen, grim future of Neo-Nazism.<br/><br/>Overall the film radiates strong messages of all that is wrong with racism. Through the use of realistic dialogue, settings and tragedy the theme(s) of racism remains constant, present and memorable in the minds of movie goers. Edward Norton does an extremely well job taking all of the film elements and using them to create a believable character (Derek) from someone such as Norton whom we would not expect to play this role. I give the movie 4 stars."

","First of all for those who comment that this film is not reality, it is reality. Racism is taught. Whether you are black or white. For those who felt they didn't get any closure to this film because it didn't explain the hatred or explain why Dereks brother was shot because he blew smoke in the boys face who shot him, clearly before that scene the boys felt hate toward each other. You don't get a feel good emotion after watching this film or closure because hate offers neither. So don't cry because this film didn't make you feel good at the end. Nobody won in this movie. They only loss and that's the point of the film. This film offers a lot because hate is pointless and the ultimate price is loss, whether its family or losing yourself."

","When I came across this film and its plot, I thought that I would like it but I never thought I'd be considering it to be one of the most well filmed most beautifully written story ever. As the back cover of the DVD mentions and in many cases it's right, American History X does know how to push every raw never to it's very core. I was surprised as that throughout watching this film, I was able to analyze everything I had saw.<br/><br/>The film digs deep into the story about a man, his bro, his family and all other people who are racial and very brutal towards are cultures. The man does a runner, killing two and spent some hard time for three years owning up for it. After the grueling period, he is released but is told and maybe convinced that his brother is going down the same track he did. Aware of his brother's unawareness of the danger that is up ahead, this man tries to prevent it.<br/><br/>Edward Norton does a very good job at playing his role of Derek Vineyard who was a very brutal, raw and sadistic being who naturally became an honest but still unstable character. His performance was very believable and Edward Furlong as the bro Danny was a good choice for a back up and he was an emotional being. The rest of the cast did very well and I enjoyed each and every one of their performances.<br/><br/>I believe the story was quite an impacting one because throughout we're feeling what these characters are going through. It's almost one of the saddest films I've seen recently since ""Angela's Ashes"".<br/><br/>The use of black and white cinematography to create the flash backs and the cinematography full of color for the current moments was done very smartly, watching it the first time it almost caught me off saying, ""what's going on here?"". Overall I loved that use of filming techniques, gave it something powerful to look forward to.<br/><br/>I think this is one of the only late 90's films which is able to stand up and rank as one of the best of it's kind, in that particular year. 9.5/10"

","Film Review American History X is about a skinhead called Derek Vinyard. He brutally kills two black guys and goes to prison for only three years. His brother, Danny, who worships Derek, was the only one who saw him kill those guys, but he didn't testify. In prison he slowly befriends a black guy. This black guy, Lamont, tells Derek that he went for prison for 6 years because he stole a television and accidentally dropped it on the foot of a police officer. Derek realizes that black people and all the foreigners are not treated fairly. He also realizes that what he has been doing is completely wrong. After three years when he's released, he notices that his little brother, Danny, is following his footsteps. Derek teaches him a life lesson and tells him that he's choosing the wrong path in life. <br/><br/>This is an amazing film. The director, the cinematographers and actors did an amazing job. I thought it was a fantastic idea to shoot the film in color and black and white. When you shoot films in color it's to get a more natural image of life and black and white is to express the realism in films. That's mostly used in documentaries and films that are based on real life. Although, back in the very old days, almost every film were filmed in black and white. I also loved the idea of filming the flashbacks in black and white, because Derek regrets his past and the color white symbolizes innocence, which I assume is not the right symbolism in this case, but it does symbolize for some common sense, although black symbolizes something more depressing like death, grief and melancholy.<br/><br/>That's not the main reasons why I love this film. The main reason why I loved the film is the story and the message. The film does an amazing job to show what's right and wrong and the way it builds up to the message is just genius. It's a story of hope and even people who have so much hate in their minds can be flipped. <br/><br/>This is a film that everyone must watch and I hope it touches everyone who watches this film just as much as me, and I hope they learn a lesson for life.<br/><br/>I have seen many films in my life but there are not many films that touches me so deeply like this film.

","I have never been able to make a decision on what my favorite movie of all time is. But American history X is without a doubt in my top 5. The performance of Edward Norton is absolutely jaw dropping. Him and Leonardo DiCaprio are one of the few actors that don't just act their roles, they live there characters lives. Derick Vinyard ( Edward Norton) is already one the most influential powerful characters to ever hit the screen.<br/><br/>Derick Vinyard is a Neo Nazi living in Los angeles California. He is the leader of a violent white sapremisis gang that rules California. This movie takes you through all the beliefs of what Derick thinks of all the different races. And most importantly the reasons why he is a skinhead. And you catch yourself throughout the movie agreeing with everything he is saying. Which amazes me that a movie has that much power that it can actually change your views in life. <br/><br/>The movie starts out with Derick getting out of jail and going home to his family. His brother who he is closest to Danny ( played by Edward Furlong) who gave the best performance in any of his movies is being told he is going to end up just like his brother. He has become a skinhead but isn't as powerful and into it like Derick was. When Derick gets home he tells his family they need to move because they weren't safe where they were living. Danny can tell that Derick has changed his way of life and is no longer part of the Nazi life. Danny has to write a paper in school called American History X assigned by the principal Mr Sweeney. Danny recaps his life and childhood with his brother. You see how Derick got sentenced to jailed by killing three black guys for breaking into his car. And curb stomping his last victim which is still to this day one of the most insane movie scenes in history. When Derick goes to jail he gets paired up with an African American who teaches him that everyone is the seem no matter what race you are everyone has flaws. And as Derick starts to realize this you start to realize this as a viewer ! you literally become Derick Vinyard as a viewer that;s how powerful this character is.<br/><br/>I don't wanna give away the ending completely Derick tries to change Danny's view on life like a big brother should and tries to provide him with a healthy way of thinking.<br/><br/>American History X is one of the most powerful movies ever made. If you haven't seen it watch it ASAP. I would recommend not with someone who gets offended easily the language is pretty bad and the violence and rape scene is very graphic. 10/10"

While in prison, after certain events and insights, Derek has an enormous change of attitude by the time he is released. On the other hand, Danny is being pushed more and more towards the white supremacist community and is slowly walking into the footsteps of his older brother.<br/><br/>The main theme throughout the film is hatred and violence toward another race as a result of extreme racism. It all started from an early scene when the boys' father is expressing why he feels certain people (i.e. black people) of minority groups get their job. This is where most of the hostility begins with Derek and Danny; this only intensifies even more when their father is killed in the line of duty. This theme is presented throughout the entire film and is inevitably brought through even to the final scene. Although I will not spoil the ending, it definitely portrays real life situations everyday that happens as a result of prejudice and racism.<br/><br/>Another movie with a similar theme could be the film Crash that came out in 2004. This film is about racial and social tensions in Los, Angeles between many different areas of race and ethnicity. As a result there are many scenes that consist of violence due to the differences that many of the characters have; whether it is language barriers or ignorance in knowledge of people with different backgrounds. Rather than involving just hatred towards the black community, the movie Crash involves almost every nationality and the stereotypes that go along with them.<br/><br/>The use of angle and lighting help with the theme and correlate with the movie to the point to where the audience can get the full effect of what they are supposed to be feeling. The story is told by Danny, the younger brother, through a paper his principal is requiring him to write called American History X. We are taken through many flashbacks that he includes in his paper during events that he can remember how Derek was before he went to prison. The black and white, during the flashbacks, not only add the sense of a past scene but give it that extra feel of being an important time that needs to be remembered. Motifs and symbols are used frequently throughout the film and definitely coincide with the message of the movie. For example, the Mein Kampf, the posters that are shown, the tattoos, and the ""skin head"" image were all ideal symbols that served a valid purpose.<br/><br/>American History X has definitely been made into a classic. Although there are some scenes that tend to make me cringe, this movie is a must see film. Not only is it an eye opener to the violence that goes on every day, but the racial issues that are still very real. This movie has a powerful message that one person can overcome their racial beliefs and become one with people of other backgrounds. Derek starts to realize you can't blame an entire group of people for the mistake that a couple of bad apples mad. There are bad people among all of us, and believe me when I see, it's not just one race that has the people."
"davydteather","10","0","1","29 July 2011"," A very powerful movie..
","I first saw this movie seven months ago and it blew me away. This movie deals with the morality and immorality of human nature. It shows how human beings can be towards one another. This movie makes a statement against racism and it's consequences.<br/><br/>This is not a movie for the faint of heart. It is not a fairy tale. It is a story about racism and the effects it can leave on people. The results are hatred, violence, rage, rape and sometimes murder. The reason some people are racist is because they were either brought up that way, influenced by other people who are racist or because they think people of other races are less superior than their own.<br/><br/>This is one of the most powerful films that has been released by Hollywood in such a long time. This film might be shocking and disturbing, but it does send a very powerful message."
"deatman9","9","0","1","28 June 2011"," Just amazing..
","This is my review of American History X. This is a masterpiece in the world of cinema. In my opinion one of the best movies ever made with stunning performances from the whole cast exspecially Edward Norton. Edward Norton is just one of those amazing actors of our time who can play any role and play it perfectly.<br/><br/>American history X is about a skinhead (Norton) who is basically the leader of the skinhead group. Until one day he goes to jail for a serious crime. He comes out reformed just to find out his younger brother (Furlong) has been brainwashed by the same people who brainwashed him. This movie revolves around the older brother (Norton)trying to help his brother find out that this is not the right way to be.<br/><br/>This is an amazing movie filled with heart racing sequences and excellent performances by all the actors involves. The script is just outstanding and the direction is even better. I recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of dramas or Edward Norton. Very two big thumbs up"
"johnnyboyz","7","0","1","28 June 2011"," Antagonistic and ruffling but all but deeply involving American drama; a forceful and affecting character piece really worth seeing.
","Told amidst a furry of tough flashbacks and present tense broiling drama, through an array of colour footage and black and white hues, Tony Kaye's American History X devilishly explores the life of a Neo-Nazi, both pre-and-post-incarceration, as well as his suffering family in a bare and unrelenting fashion. We dislike the opening of the film, we dislike the opening of Kaye's film on the basis that it is ugly and frank; we dislike the fact that we are challenged to process not only the apparent ugliness of the sexual content but the Nazi infused props littering the screen, and are forced into calculating which of those leaves the nastier taste. We dislike the fact that, next door in a room of his own, is situated a young boy seemingly forced into possessing a building with such a person complete with such activity going on in such close proximity. We side with the boy, and are somewhat forced against our wishes into sympathising with all of those whom inhabit the house when a group of blank, faceless African-Americans plot outside to sabotage the car on the driveway – and all of this before the really nasty bit happens.<br/><br/>It is to the credit of those behind American History X that they are able to take the project from these beginnings and to do what they do; the film much more than a freak show unfolding in a cesspool of crudity and violence - the film refusing to allow its powerful opening to act as its dramatic high point, instead allowing the transitions it documents to act as its key source of drama, in what is a pleasurable and really rather involving thriller about changing attitudes and the dangers of influence. Those primarily involved in the opening are that of Edward Furlong's Danny, the boy in his room, and that of his older brother Derek, played by Edward Norton. They are siblings of the Vinyard family, the pair of them two Los Angeles based brothers. Danny is a high school student; Derek is something a little different, but they share the pain of their father's death, following the falling foul of a black individual, and maintain ties to their mother who's trying to maintain a new relationship.<br/><br/>Danny raises eyebrows at school after doing a school paper that is a riff on Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf, something which causes great concern amidst his peers. Elliott Gould's character Murray, Danny's history teacher, is worried of the possibility he may follow down a route similar to that of his brother; the verbal outlining of whom shortly follows as the severity of Norton's character is built up, a speech which documents the man's history to do with formulating a national front along with some other radical thinkers that concludes with the fact he is about to be released from prison following a three year stretch. Despite the severity of Murray's outlining, Norton's Derek later appears somewhat chilled upon release; cool at the fact his younger brother has moved up into some echelons more broadly resembling that of where Derek himself was at a similar age. It is a reaction, and whose general behaviour, goes against prior perceptions; particularly when interacting with his fascist friend of old in Seth (Suplee), whom looks up to Derek and half-expects him, along with the rest of a neo-Nazi front that has formulated, to really lead them to where they want to go.<br/><br/>Kaye's film will dart back and forth from some relatively tough sequences motivated by hatred and racism to the current tense of reform. Shot in black and white, and holding very little back, Derek's earlier times of violence and antagonism carry with them a cutting, biting aesthetic; a prominent sense of the content always being on the move sewn into proceedings, whether induced by the man's motivational speeches encouraging hate and anti-social behaviour, shortly before the playing out of such things, or the more visually dramatic sequences such as that of a basketball match between two teams that has some high stakes. Derek's post-incarceration exchanges, shot in colour, but still looking as if drained, although successfully coming across as glorious Technicolour in comparison to the rancid black and white, appear calmer; more laid-back and are not motivated by causality as much. Kaye's compositions during these segments additionally appear to open up a little more, allowing for more room to breath and for those of foreign nationalities, or varying other ethnicities, to share the frame a little more – when, nearer the end, Danny is escorted to school by his brother, we notice those of an African American or Hmong ilk milling around in the background, as if invited to occupy the film's frame with the two leads as a collective one such is the newfound sense of acceptance.<br/><br/>The film's starker sequences indeed carry with them great adrenaline and a sense of the perversely engaging, the aforementioned basketball sequence one of many that additionally includes the trashing of a local store now owned by some Koreans as well as a grotesquely violent act during the opening. In spite of this, the film maintains such an aggressive and pent-up attitude for the sequences in which Derek confronts his past neo-Nazi accomplices; a lesser film made in a lesser fashion might have, purposely or otherwise, done well, in a negative sense, to fetishise such sequences of hate and shoot the gradual inclination toward a newer order in a drabber fashion. Another instance might have seen the content played safe, a film distancing itself from such sequences of bigotry before constructing the demonisation process in a self-important manner threatening to mutate the piece into some kind of lecture. Kaye impressively, purposely or otherwise, blows through the material in an equal on-both-fronts-fashion; maintaining a dogged grip on dramatic proceedings as controversial content is executed and hate at those the lead previously shared times with is unfolded. Regardless, the film is tough but engaging and worth seeing."

","""American History X"" opens with our Hitler-loving, lispy Edward Norton shooting down two black people with a swastika tattooed across his chest which perfectly depicts the mood and theme for the entire film. I absolutely loved ""American History X"" and here's why.<br/><br/>Tony Kaye directs this film to near perfection, right from the beautiful over-cranking shot in black and white (which cleverly outlines the battle between the blacks and the whites) to the intense rape scene in the shower, ""American History X"" deals with some intense subject matter and is also quite upsetting violent which is probably why it didn't win the Oscar for ""Best Picture"" although I'm pretty sure it deserved it.<br/><br/>The cinematography is equally impressive and Edward Norton plays his character brilliantly and so does Edward Furlong as the confused teen heading down his older brother's path. What is great about this film is that it has an engaging story to tell and it tells it superbly through intelligent flashbacks and flawless directing. It deals with racism roughly, I mean that it doesn't hold back on shocking the audience which is good because it delivers a powerful punch by the time the credits role.<br/><br/>The characterisation is superb and we get some really in-depth character analysis as well as well thought out scenes. I also found the screenplay remarkably impressive it's fast and intelligent and manages to build a believable story with an inspirational turn-around before a real bash of realism. The ending is incredibly emotional and thoughtful.<br/><br/>""American History X"" is for anyone who appreciates good film-making. if you're after an action-filled fiscal noisy ride then stay away. This is intelligent, thoughtful and brave film-making at its best and would go as far to say this is a masterpiece"
"ajs-10","9","0","1","12 June 2011"," An enthralling tale of redemption...
","I have to admit that I have seen this film before, but I maybe didn't appreciate it as much before as I did this time around. Everything about it is great, the plot, the dialogue, the performances, the cinematography and the music are all excellent. It maybe wouldn't have been top of my list of films to see due to the subject matter, but I was pleasantly surprised by it. Yes, it does tend to wander a little in the middle and the pacing isn't at top whack, but it is quite compelling viewing all the same.<br/><br/>Derek Vinyard was a neo-Nazi when he went into prison for the murder of two thieves at his house. He was the top dog amongst the guys he ran with, all with shaven heads and believing every word of their leader. Words fed to him by the manipulative Cameron Alexander. But something changed in Derek while he was inside, he came out wanting nothing to do with these people any more. He is in fear that his little brother, Danny will follow him down the same route. We are told, in flashback, how Derek became involved with these people in the first place and what went on in prison to change his view. The trouble is, is it too late for young Danny? As you've probably already guessed, the Spoiler Police won't allow me to say any more.<br/><br/>I have to say hats off to both Edward Norton as Derek and Edward Furlong as Danny. I have not seen either of them put in a better performance either before or since. Also worthy of note are; Beverly D'Angelo as their mother, Doris, Avery Brooks as the head teacher, Dr. Bob Sweeney, Jennifer Lien as their sister, Davina, Stacy Keach as the evil Cameron Alexander and it was also nice to see Elliott Gould as Murray, the English teacher.<br/><br/>A large portion of the film is told in flashback and all of the flashback portions are in black and white, making it very easy for the audience to discern where the story is. I found this enhanced rather than distracted me from the narrative. There is much to admire in this film and I enjoyed it immensely. So, over all a really well made film with some great performances, a great score, a great script and some great cinematography Recommended.<br/><br/>My Score: 8.7/10"

","American History X is a film about an ex neo-Nazi Skinhead leader (Edward Norton) who has just served a three year prison sentence for murder. But he comes out of prison a changed reformed man and tries to stop his brother (Edward Furlong) going down the same violent path he did. This violent, powerful film shocked many audiences with its brutal truth of white supremacy groups in America.<br/><br/>The story is told brilliantly and keeps you feeling very unsettled throughout. The film often showed flashbacks revealing truths about main character Derek's past and how he ended up in prison. The flashbacks are shown in black and white, which I think works very well as it emphasises the darkness of his past. The film deals with some very violent shocking scenes that possibly aren't suitable for small children or in fact some adults. But I felt there needed to be strong violence as it wouldn't have had the same effect.<br/><br/>The directing, photography and acting I thought were all flawless. A film that really deserves a lot more credit than it received."
"azteccrawdaddy","9","0","1","28 April 2011"," What a Great Film. Everyone Should See This
","It's amazing when I hear people say they didn't like this movie - one, no one ever says that, and two, it's a cinematic masterpiece if I've ever seen one. Everything flows together in a way that only the Scorceses and Spielbergs can pull off. I really felt connections to the characters as they developed, something that has been all but lost in modern filmmaking. <br/><br/>Derek Vinyard's life is chronicled in such a way that you can almost draw parallels to your own; I thought about all of the things I've done that hurt other people, which in comparison were hardly that bad, of course, but the fact that even someone as evil and brainwashed as himself can be redeemed and be a small instrument of what is good about humanity is enlightening, if not humbling.<br/><br/>Detractors of the film claim that his transformation is too extreme to be taken seriously, a product of amateur screen writing and a false sense of morality, but I argue just the opposite. No matter how far someone has fallen, there is always a glimmer of hope, and sometimes it just takes a new form of stimuli for them to realize it."
"abfacebookab","7","0","2","15 February 2011"," Very good movie? yes. Instant classic? no.
","This is a response to some negative reviews. Some people were wondering how Derek, a supposedly smart kid was influenced only by his dad's one remark. Though the movie did not explicitly say this, I believe it is after his father died that he met Cameron, who became a father figure to Derek, and with his constant propaganda began to change Derek's mind and overwhelm the opinions of his family. Another question is why the African-American kid kills Danny at the end for seemingly nothing but blowing smoke in his face. Again it is implied that this is not their first interaction, and with Danny's opinions probably made very public, there was probably growing tensions between them, that with the smoke just put him over the edge, not to mention the African-American kid was also in a gang that was probably fighting with the white supremacist group Danny and Derek were a part of. This gang was also probably responsible for trying to kill Cameron and Seth at the end. Also, the ""change of heart"" that Derek had did not take place in 2 days like some reviewers are saying. Remember that Derek saw dealings he didn't like between his group and the minority groups in prison, this lead to tensions between him and the group which lead to him being raped in the shower. This combined with the growing relationship between him and the African-American he was working with and Sweeney's guidance were all factors in changing his attitude. Remember this was based on a true story so these events are not all bullshit. I do agree that some of the editing and stylistic choices weren't the best (ie the slow motion and could have explained things more clearly with more scenes). However it was still a very powerful movie."
"gregorenee","9","0","3","7 February 2011"," One of the major themes of this film is race relations, and racism
","The film American History X was released in 1998 by director Tony Kaye. One of the major themes of this film is race relations, and racism. The film is based on how races relate and how people see things the way they want when they are hurt by people of a certain race. In the film Derek Vinyard played by Edward Norton is very frustrated about life and the fact that a black man took his father away from him by murdering him in cold blood. Derek could never get over it, and he wanted revenge. Derek is sent to prison for killing two black men who tried to steal his vehicle.<br/><br/>When Derek is released from prison after serving 3 years in prison he is changed his outlook about racism, but for Derek he will have to face it again, and through his younger brother Danny who is played by Edward Furlong a young lost soul who is following in his brothers footsteps. The film is very intense and very graphic you are able to see the way white supremacist act against other races.<br/><br/>The film shows black and white scenes which represents Derek's pass and how he ends up where he is in life. It helps bring life and understanding to the film. The lightning in the film is both high and low depending on the scene of the film. The low key lightning is used to show dark and evil hatred that the white supremacist has against other races.<br/><br/>This film can also be compared to the film Higher Learning which is also about racism and race relations. American History X is a must see film it is the sociological imagination of a white male who has reacted in a very negative way due to his past."
"veruka_jade","10","0","3","6 February 2011"," Amazing Movie
","American History X is an enlightening film about race, violence, and learning acceptance. Edward Norton gives a phenomenal performance as Derek Vineyard, an influential white supremacist. This is not a role I would imagine for Norton, but he makes the character completely believable. Edward Furlong plays the perfect struggling teen, Danny Vineyard, who is trying to find himself and fit-in at the same time. Derek is sent to prison for murder, while Danny is left behind to follow in Derek's footsteps. Derek learns a great deal about people and stereotypes during his three year incarceration. He eventually wishes a different life for Danny. With the help of one of his former teachers, he realizes that nothing he has done as the leader of his skinhead crew has made his life better. Instead of finding solutions to problems, he had been perpetuating a cycle of violence.<br/><br/>This movie gives viewers a detailed look at racism and prejudice in our country. There is great use of flashbacks, shown in black and white, to provide a glimpse of how things came to be the way they are. The opening flashback scene was very powerful, giving an understanding of Derek's pride and his importance to Danny. Narration by Danny is also instrumental in letting the audience have an inside look at the Vineyard family. He looks up to his older brother and has seen some truth in Derek's views.<br/><br/>This movie shares some common characteristics with the film Gran Torino. Both movies are led by racists white men who seem to make no exceptions when it comes to their hatred of minority races. It takes the development of a personal relationship with someone of color to make the men reconsider their preconceived notions. Derek comes to befriend his black coworker in prison. He realizes that it is not race that makes a person good or bad, and he learns that injustices do exist for minorities in our society.<br/><br/>The end of the film is ironic but depressing. After Derek shares his epiphany with his younger brother, the violent cycle continues. Danny is shot and killed by a young black boy who used to be a target of Danny's hatred. Just when Danny may have been able to see the boy with different eyes, his chance is taken away. Derek blames himself for being such a strong influence in Danny's life. He can take his life in a new direction, but he can't change what has already been done."

","All is not well down by the beach. Local teenager and Venice Beach High School student Daniel Vinyard (Edward Furlong) is on the same slippery slope his older brother, Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton), was on. After their fire fighter father, Dennis (William Russ), was murdered while putting out a blaze at a known drug den, young Derek was molded and guided by Cameron Alexander (Stacie Keach), a local white supremacist. Derek became the charismatic leader of the local neo-Nazi gang, the DOC. Here he recruited the scared and disenfranchised white kids in the neighborhood who were tired of living in fear of the growing local minority dominate gangs. Now, Derek has just been released from prison after serving time for the murder of 2 black, local gang members, who were trying to steal his car. As an older, wiser Derek emerges from prison, has he been released in time to save his family from the wide reaching grip of violence and racial tensions created by his own rhetoric? Director Tony Kaye's use of color wasn't to just simply help the viewer understand scenes that take place in the present and scenes that happen in the past. The motive of color goes deeper, as the present day scenes of color show us how Derek now views the world, with all its color and diversity. This is a stark contrast from the Derek of the past, whose view was much narrower and he saw the world as simple as black and white. Also, the use of low-key lighting during the past and the racially charged scene shows the clouded views of hate that Derek and others have of their surrounding world. Racially charged films show how their characters justify their hate. Much like Clint Eastwood's film, Gran Torino, the main character, Walt, drew his hatred for minorities from his war experiences. In American History X, Derek's hate was driven, in most part, by the senseless murder of his father (Morrissey & Kaye, 1998). This racially charged film shows that the world we live in isn't as simple as black and white."

","My introduction to the screen presence that is Edward Norton, this film is astonishing. Norton OWNS this movie, and apparently not just on screen; legend has it that Tony Kaye disowned his film, as he was ultimately not happy with how it came out, and that there was major turmoil between him and the principal cast. You would not know, going by what you get as the final product (it makes me curious how different Kaye's vision was to begin with).<br/><br/>A powerful piece of work from beginning to end, it is uncompromising. It presents the story very much from a ""Devil's Advocate"" point of view; Norton's character is presented as intelligent, and in his twisted way, a caring brother, son and boyfriend. It presents the neo-Nazi argument as one that you can ALMOST understand and empathise with. Some would say this is dangerous, but I believe it is just honest and intelligent storytelling.<br/><br/>It is not just in the way the story is told that it pulls no punches; the violence is tough and unflinching, showing just a bit more than you feel you need to see, to drive the point home. The now infamous ""bite the kerb"" scene remains one that scars you for some time. The film's finale is still one of the most surprising, shocking and poignant I can think of. The message of the film regarding hate and anger is brilliantly stated in the final act. Performances from a stellar cast, headed by Ed Norton in what remains his most controversial and powerful screen role.<br/><br/>Approach with some caution, but definitely approach!"

The task is a full essay on how his life has been shaped by the events that have taken place including the events that took place to land his brother Derek Vinyard played by Edward Norton in prison. The day Danny met with principle and assigned his new objective was the day that Derek is released from prison. Derek became very involved in a white supremacist group and his hatred for humans with color was intense. One night Derek's vehicle was being broken in to and he goes out and catches the guys, he killed themhe went to prison. While in prison Derek's job paired him with a black man and over time they become close and Derek changes. Derek's change is the prime example to the prominent theme of the moviethe capacity of oneself to change. The movie deals with the life of Danny and Derek Vinyard and some crucial issues that deal with racism and social injustices. The themes of the movie are the ability to change yourself, racism issues, and social injustices. The motif and symbols seen throughout the movie were very relevant to the theme. The Mein Kampf, the posters, and the tattoos were all relevant to the theme of the movie. The dialogue to the movie was very appropriate and stayed right in line with the themes. The movie American History X was a great movie that dealt this issues that always seem to be issues at least in the past and present the issue of racism and social injustices have always been a problem and could be a problem in the future. I like how this movie showed the hatred, anger, and violence within a family and within the society but this movie showed all the gritty details and scenes that were full of hate but it also showed the consequences of decisions and the light at the end of the dark tunnel."

","Released In: 1998 Main Characters: Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton), Daniel ""Danny"" Vinyard (Edward Furlong), Murray (Elliott Gould), Dr. Sweeny (Avery Brooks)<br/><br/>American History X is a film that both glorifies and humanizes racism. Derek Vinyard, Danny Vinyard's older brother was in the neo-Nazi ""movement"" due to past experiences with the loss of his father. Derek's father was firefighter who was killed trying to protect others, protecting an African American home and lost his life. This in sighted a rage in Derek, therefore affecting his entire family. This rage affected Derek's thought process and he felt as if he was doing what was right in society. Derek ended up going to prison and serving time for his outrageous acts. This is when Derek came to see the error of his ways. Derek met an African American, who befriended him in prison. This man allowed Derek to see things a little differently. Derek then returned home, hoped to change the ways that he had established within his family, with this return; he found the complete opposite. <br/><br/>American History X has an overall theme of something everyone can relate to, making amends for past transgressions; more specifically the love of two brothers and the care for they have for one another. Another major theme that many people see within this film is racism. Racism is a major concern. Derek was the leader of the racist side within his community before his imprisonment. Derek influences many of his followers throughout this film. His followers were dissolution impressionable youths with weak family ties, had few friends, and needed to be a part of something. Danny, Derek's brother was one of the many who were affected by this strong organizer. This system appeared to be organized and was something that many were doing. However when Derek was imprisoned he had the capabilities to see African Americans as humans beings versus vicious animals. By doing this, his impression changed completely. Derek wanted nothing more for his brother to see the other side. Derek tired immensely to change Danny, however struggled. Danny began to see the truth in Derek's ways, Danny's heart and mind were changing. Danny tried to make amends with the African American boys in his school. Danny was strong minded, however not as strong minded as the African Americans. They were still acting out in rage like both Derek and Danny used to. In the end, Danny was murdered. Danny was killed by the African American, who was raised just like Danny. This African American boy did not and was not ready to make amends and see that all are equal. <br/><br/>The theme of American History X can directly relate to the movie ""Crash"". Both of these films have a great deal of racism. Along with racism, making amends for past transgressions. The angle and lighting immensely relate to the theme of American History X. The film is shot in black and white that clearly conveyed one of the main themes racial tensions between blacks and whites. There are several scenes where the camera angle also conveys the theme; when Derek speaks throughout the film they focused on the swastika on his chest; he was proud to show it. In contrast in prison he was not, he became ashamed. <br/><br/>In conclusion, the efforts glorify the racist movement failed. Derek saw the humanity in his prison friends. Derek began to have an understanding and love for many people; with his change in heart, he hoped to influence others."

","American History X is a film about a guy who was a former Neo-Nazi who changed his life after doing a 3 year sentence in prison. This guy Derrek Vinyard, played by Edward Norton, has a younger brother Danny, played by Edward Furlong, who is basically going down the same road as Derrek did before jail. Derrek tries to prevent this from happening. Derek's deviant behavior had great influence on his little brother. Derrek was the leader of a gang of white supremacists in which committed racial crimes. Derrek's reason for going to prison was for killing three guys who tried to steal his truck in his yard. Oh, not to mention, the 3 guys were black. This film shows that no matter what a person has done in their past, change and forgiveness is possible. This film's story is told through Danny in the form of a paper through use of flashbacks. The purpose of this was because Danny wrote a paper for class that was not approved and Dr. Sweeny, played by Avery Brooks, made him rewrite the paper. This paper was to be about his brother's life. The editor's use of flashbacks and montages make this a film to be seen. The use of sound effects and customs are very effective and helps the film become real. The up close angles and the flashbacks encourage the viewing to be on edge and on point. This is a must see movie. The superb acting and the music behind each scene makes this movie of racial crime and reformation a must see movie. I will not spoil it for you, but of course all drama films have a twist."

","Derek Vinyard, played by Edward Norton, is the leader of a white supremacists group who serves time in prison for murdering a black guy trying to steal his vehicle. While Derek is in prison, his younger brother, Danny, played by Edward Furlong, seems to be following in his foot steps. Danny narrates throughout the movie about his paper he had to re-write for Dr. Sweeney. The paper was about his brother Derek and why he was in prison. Derek befriends his black laundry friend while in prison and becomes to realize black people really aren't that bad. He really begins to realize his mistakes and misconception when he is raped in the shower room. Derek calls upon Dr. Sweeney to help him get out of prison. Dr. Sweeney acts as Derek's mentor at some point. The theme of the movie was racial tolerance and how people deal with it. The movie goes into detail as to why Derek has become the way he did. Derek finally gets out of prison and reconnects with his family after 3 years. He has reformed from being the white supremacist he was and wants to live a decent life beyond that. He attends a party at which the head of the group, Cameron Alexander, played by Stacy Keach, is in his office talking with Danny. Derek makes it a point to tell Cameron that he wants out and that he wants nothing more to do with the group. He tells him to leave his brother alone. While Derek has reformed and is trying to get his life back on track, he feels the need to look after Danny and keep him out of trouble. The tragic ending of the movie comes when the black kid who had a grudge towards Danny for blowing smoke in his face ends up killing him in the boys bathroom. The ending of the movie leaves you with this thought..""Will Derek revert and become hateful towards black people again?"" American History X was a movie about one dominate race amongst another, that being the whites as being superior to any other race. Racial hate crimes still happen today. But do people come out of prison as a reformed person like Derek Vinyard did? We don't hear about that too much these days. I found out that American History X was based on a true story. I read this in a IMDb movie review. The guy, who the reviewer could not remember his name, comes to the high school where he used to attend to a speech about racial prejudice and hate crimes. To this day I believe that no matter what we try to do to abolish racial prejudice that leads to hate crimes, it's just not going to be a permanent thing. I feel you can maybe change a person and their views about the subject but you cannot change everybody's opinion. It all goes back to the history of how and why racial prejudice began."
"Manal1987","8","0","4","5 October 2010"," Highly overrated
","Totally loved it. But I'm a little bit disappointed I have to admit! The reviews I read prior watching American History X, and the fact that it was ranked one of the best movies of all time made me set the bar really high up. And during my two-hour view I was waiting for that moment when I'll be truly AWED. It didn't come though! I was highly entertained and thought-provoked... but never touched. <br/><br/>The movie digs deep into one of the most unsettling problems in the American society (and it makes me think maybe I'd be more touched if I were an American myself!) and materializes its social impact. Director Tony Kaye did a great job shockingly portraying the gruesome and painful outcomes of this vicious circle of hate. However, he heavily depended on melodramatic score and slow-motioned takes and flashbacks to heighten this effect, which, I think, was quite cheesy. <br/><br/>The movie is beautifully written, and wonderfully performed. Edward Norton has this magnetic charisma that you can't help waiting for the next scene he'll be in. His performance is naturally flawless. The young Edward Furlong pulled it off brilliantly as well."
"barrwell","9","0","3","16 September 2010"," Edward Norton gives Oscar-worthy performance in moving drama
","American History X is an intense, moving film dealing with racial tension in contemporary American society. Edward Norton, in a performance that should have won an Oscar, plays Derek Vinyard over the course of several years. As the film opens we see him as the leader of a group of skinheads in LA. Later he goes to prison for murder and emerges as a changed man. We also see him as a sixteen year old (thru flashbacks), and he is amazing and memorable throughout the entire film.<br/><br/>We find out that Derek was always intelligent and a natural leader, this is why local longtime racist and militant Cameron (Stacy Keach) has been grooming him to lead a young band of racist punks. Cameron is using Derek to fulfill some warped agenda of his, but Derek doesn't see through Cameron until its too late. After some black punks attempt to break into a car outside Dereks house, he murders one of them in a shocking and graphic scene that shows the depth of Dereks hatred and brutality.<br/><br/>Dereks family has also been effected by racism...when Derek was 16, his firefighter father was murdered by a black junkie while on duty and he has become the man of the family and father figure to younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong). Danny is a lot like Derek, and we can just tell that he could go either way in life, but currently seems to be following Dereks lead.<br/><br/>This is an emotionally and physically scarred family, the mother (Beverly Deangelo) smokes too much and is constantly coughing, yet still is desperately trying to hold her family together. She is seeking a man to be a father figure to Derek and starts dating a Jewish teacher (Elliot Gould). In possibly the best scene in the film (at least the most thought provoking), Goulds' character and Derek get into a political debate at the dinner table that soon gets out of control. Its an amazing scene and brilliantly acted, this is a scene every American should watch as topics are discussed that most films just don't have the courage to explore. In a way It's like the quintessential left vs right debate over racial issues, but we are also left thinking that Derek, while making some real points, can not discuss these points without ultimately showing his racial hatred and turning violent....he's been programmed by his hatred.<br/><br/>The film moves on to Dereks prison years, I wont divulge details here, but this is the period that changes Derek immensely. He eventually opens up to a black fellow inmate with whom he becomes friends, and as events play out we see the ultimate irony occur which results in a changed Derek.<br/><br/>The final act of the film gives us a reformed Derek (with a full head of hair) released from prison and trying to start over. When he gets home he finds his brother Danny has been in contact with Cameron and tries to intervene. Danny is a becoming a mirror image of what Derek once was and Derek must act to stop him. Any more at this point would be a spoiler but I will add a few more thoughts...<br/><br/>In the flashbacks to Derek at age 16 we see that despite all the outside influences that developed his hatred....originally it may have came right from his own home. Nobody is born a racist, racism is taught...I think that is one of the points the film-makers wanted to make.<br/><br/>This a shattering, heartbreaking film....a true masterpiece in the realm of social drama. The quote at the end from a speech by Abe Lincon is very fitting. This is an American classic that every American should see at least once.<br/><br/>Also, I really was pleasantly surprised to see this film rated so highly at IMDb, not that it doesn't deserve it because it does. This is rated higher here than many very very good films....but I wanted to add my 2 cents worth anyway..."
"FrannyBeanz","10","0","3","17 August 2010"," Nothing Short of a Masterpiece
","It would be an insult to call this a ""movie"". It is a MASTERPIECE. I first saw this in my senior year of high school, and I literally sat in stunned silence well into the end credits. By the time this film is finished, you've been taken on an emotional roller-coaster and you feel like you've been punched in the gut. I know I did. Edward Norton turns in another amazing performance as the reformed skin-head who tries to prevent his younger brother from following in his footsteps. It's the story of how Derek (Norton) goes to prison for killing 2 black guys who he catches trying to break into his car. His younger brother, Danny (Furlong) witnesses the whole thing. Prison changes Derek's perspective on life dramatically, and upon his release from jail, finds out that Danny is coming dangerously close to mimicking Derek's dangerous neo-nazi ways. In order to explain to a confused Danny why he is so different now, he tells him about his horrible and traumatizing experience in jail, which we are shown through flashbacks. Some people argue that the ending was predictable... call me naive, but I did NOT see it coming, and I was left, literally, with my jaw on the floor. This movie will stay with you, and it may even change you. Ed Norton was robbed of the Best Actor Oscar. This movie belongs in everyone's collection. It's something you won't soon forget."

","American History X is a story about two brothers, Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) and a black drug dealer while fighting a fire in a neighborhood in Los Angeles murdered Daniel Vinyard (Edward Furlong), who fight racism after their father, who was a firefighter. Derek goes to prison for 3 years after brutally killing black gang members who he catches breaking into his families car. Daniel follows his brother's footstep until Derek gets out of prison and tries to stop Daniel from going down the same path. Derek finally gets Daniel on the right path and Daniel is dropped off at school where a black kid shoots him in the bathroom; a black kid that Daniel had confrontation with earlier in the film. The theme of the film is about racism. The family battles it after a black drug dealer killed their father. The movie focuses on problems and conflicts between the family and black people. There is a scene where Derek organizes a raid on a foreign owned grocery store. He organizes people to go into this store and raid it, tearing up the inside in the process and confronting the owners. In the beginning of the film Derek kills, black gang members after they are caught breaking into his family's car. He shots at them, then makes a man put his teeth on the curb, and kicks the back of his head. Derek is then arrested. Daniel follows Derek's footsteps and joins the white supremacist. While Derek is in jail, Dr. Sweeny (Avery Brooks) visits him and Avery convinces him that racism is pointless. Derek realizes that the only reason he stayed alive in prison was a black person that he became close friends with. Time in prison was life changing for Derek and he was determined to change the family's lives when he got out. Derek and Daniel were committed to a better lifestyle without racism when Derek drops Daniel off a school Daniel goes into the bathroom and is confronted by a black boy from the previous day. They look each other in the eye and Daniel is shot to death right in the bathroom. American History X and Crash are identical in theme and plot. They both are about people who are racist in the beginning but then open up by the end of the movie. Both of these movies start out harsh in relevance to racism and by the end, all people are getting along. The lighting and color choice were very appropriate for this film. The film went from color to black and white, which was appropriate for the scenes they were showing. For example, the scene where Derek shots the gang members is black and white and I think it added feeling and dramatization to the scene. The color scenes were not overly bright which sets the mood for the film and how Derek's family is unhappy and racist. The lighting was not very bright and was dull throughout the movie. Both the lighting and color choice set the mood and tone of the entire movie. The motif in this film was the swastika as it was portrayed throughout the film. It was tattooed on Derek's chest, it was on posters in Derek and Daniel's room and it was seen many times throughout the movie. This shows or proves that the movie is about racism and white supremacists. This symbol was a fit for the theme of the movie and it was evident when they were taking there posters down that they were going to attempt a better life and a life without racism in it. This was an excellent movie and I enjoyed it however, I feel that it was very violent and should not be viewed by everyone. Not every individual can handle this film because of the graphic nature and the extent of the violence and the language. I think that everything was needed to get the theme across but once again; I would not recommend this movie to everyone especially if you are easily offended."
"mgr81760","9","0","3","28 July 2010"," Really Very Well Done
","I just saw this film on DVD. I thought it was very well done.<br/><br/>I thought Ed Norton was very well cast in this role, and delivered superbly. In fact, he was a lot more convincing as a white racist then he was the reformed and much milder man who came out of prison. Overall, I thought the acting was very well done with an emphasis on his performance.<br/><br/>I liked very much that the script confronted some realities. The speech he gives outside the grocery was correct when seen from that perspective, i.e., he didn't have to make things up to rile up his cohorts, he just had to speak the truth as it presents itself to that demographic: lower white middle class. Mouthing platitudes about how bad racism is a useless endeavor, if we ignore the factors that have so many whites scared and responding in racist fashion in lieu of any other way to express what they see as their grievances. The script forces us to confront the reality that it's not just bigotry that is the problem, but the underlying forces.<br/><br/>And I think this is why Danny dies in end. There is no happy ending to this story, because even if Derek is reformed, there's another racist a- borning, either black or white, and willing to use violence to address his problems. This isn't really a happy film, and I don't think anyone can walk away from it feeling the better for it. But I do think we walk away having learned from it, and that, indeed, is what art is about."
"naufilisaninja","10","0","3","9 July 2010"," A powerful film exploring white nationalist culture
","Watching this film was really quite an experience. I found the film to be intelligent and culturally informed. It bought up a lot of issues and explored them in depth. There were references to the Rodney King incident, various historical studies and more involved. Another thing about this film was the sheer intensity and violence. That image of Edward Norton's character pavement-stomping the African-American man who was breaking into his house and then him lifting his arms before the police revealing the swastika tattoo on his chest, that remains etched into many people's memories as a rather classical film moment. The whole make-up of white nationalist culture is probed here as Derek Vinyard (excellently portrayed by Edward Norton) attempts to escape from the neo-nazi gang he was once the second-in-command of and prevent his brother Danny (Edward Furlong) going down the same path. There is one other performance that stands out and that is Stacy Keach's menacing portrayal of white nationalist mentor, Cameron Alexander. Overall this is an excellent film, a classic that should be remembered. I've said enough."
"Dorrito79","10","0","3","6 July 2010"," One of my favourite movies EVER
","I saw this movie about 10 years ago when it came out in the cinema. None of my friends wanted to see it so I went on my own and I remember sitting there when it ended, and thinking about what just happened. And it lasted for days. This movie is one of the very few that changed the way I think of cinema, cinematography and the role of music. Ed Norton plays Derek, the right hand of a nazi leader and Ed Furlong is his little brother, who follows him whatever he does. When Derek kills a black guy trying to steal his car, he goes to prison for 3 years and there he faces the fact that everything he believed in was built on lies and deception, and belief can be twisted for the sake of convenience. He comes out as a changed man and the movie is the story of the next 24 hours, what Derek does next, as well as flashbacks to the reasons why he became a racist. Edward Norton is as brilliant as it gets. This is one of his major roles in his career. He leaves a deep impression and his change for the role, putting on 30 pounds of muscle and shaving his head, is jaw-droppingly convincing, considering his slim build and intellectual aura. Furlong is as memorable as in Terminator 2 - even though he is a sidekick, he plays the disturbed and dependent little bro perfectly well. Thinking he is a rebel, he is eating every misplaced ideology that he is given, without ever freely making choices for himself. Some of the shots stay with the viewer a long time after standing up from the chair, and the music is dripping with emotion. This is a gorgeous movie, a must see for anyone who appreciates quality cinema. Only criticism is about the ending of the movie that did not convince me, however, I do not feel strongly enough about it to take points off the perfect 10."

","American History X (1998)<br/><br/>5 word summary<br/><br/>Former Neo-Nazi tries saving brother <br/><br/>American History X is a fantastic story of a ex Neo-Nazi skinhead who has changed his ways and is now trying to stop his brother from going down the same path that he went, which ended with him in prison. <br/><br/>There is a large list of things that made this film so great. To start off the directing and editing. Showing the past when Derek was a skinhead as black and white, and the present as color, was a great idea. Not doing that would have been fine but since they did it, it really added a sense of darkness. It's the way he wants his life and his country, colorless, and it feels more depressing. All the acting was great, Edward Furlong, Ethan Suplee, Elliot Gould, everyone really gave believable and some of their best performances. <br/><br/>I didn't add Edward Norton in that group because he deserves extra attention for his role. Its amazing. The way he gives his lines, his body language, his facial expressions, everything is remarkable. The scene in which he kills the man for breaking into his car for instance, the look on his face is terrifying, so much pride and anger and accomplishment all shown in that one look as the cops show up. There are scenes with him as a skinhead talking about how bad immigrants, jews and blacks are and you just believe that's how Edward Norton feels, cause he just sells it so well its hard to believe hes acting. Then, he gets out of prison and his thoughts have changed and again you believe everything he says. Personally I think the scene that he shines the most in is when he's yelling at his old friend Cameron at his party, telling him to stay away from him and his brother, that scene alone makes me wonder how he didn't win the Oscar that year.<br/><br/>American History X is such an important film. In a time when many feel racism isn't as much of an issue anymore this film shows that it is still real and shows the terror that it can bring. Although I doubt any extreme racists have seen this film and changed their way, it seems like it should. Derek learns the errors of his way, and we see it happen. We see how terrible white people and black people can be, but we see how good they can be too. It shows how racism is just ignorance and stubbornness, not knowing about other races and not wanting to. Derek never really knew any black people, he just thought he did, when he finally starts talking to Lamont (the black man he works with in prison) he sees he's his only friend in that prison, not the other Nazis but a man who, before then, he would have wanted dead. <br/><br/>American History X is one of my all time favorite films and I think most people would agree that its one of the best. Its drama at its best; moving, sad, gritty, powerful and beautiful. A must see by everyone <br/><br/>10/10"

Now, I was blown away by Norton's performance in Primal Fear but I thought he outdid himself as Derek in American History X<br/><br/>Now, I consider myself a great and avid lover of film today but at that time was only familiar with more commercial fare that studios throw tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars into. I just find it unfortunate that regardless of his Oscar nomination, the movie itself reportedly only grossed around $10 million at the box office, meaning it probably got a limited release. If I remember correctly, Scarface was also a bust at the box office. Also, this years Oscar winner for best picture (The Hurt Locker) only had a limited release in theaters and reportedly grossed the least amount in history for a best picture win at the Oscars.

The black and white scenes are the past and the present is in color. The scene in the prison shower is not an easy one to watch neither is the killing scene. The director shows the ugliness of hate in the family home and in the community. They have a great cast like Avery Brooks, Stacy Keach, William Russ, Jennifer Lien. It's a sad story!

It all culminates one night when he uses brutally excessive force on two black criminals who try and rob his house, killing them and being sent to prison for a few years. Upon his release, he is a changed man and wants to distance himself from the life he once lead- unfortunately, his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) appears to be heading down the same path, getting in trouble with school head master Dr. Sweeney (Avery Brooks) for writing an essay on 'Mein Kempth.' It's a race against time to direct him down the right path.<br/><br/>Most of the most respected and well known of actors burst on to the scene with some sort of springboard, some role that gained them recognition and got them tipped as a future star to watch out for. This, surely, was what served for Edward Norton. For his breath taking performance here is the sheer driving force of this amazing examination of the cancer of hatred and the violence and self destruction that evolves. There is a passion and raw intensity delivered from him, that makes it so good it in fact reduces Stephen Graham's crazed skinhead in This is England to a poor man's version of it. That assured delivery and natural screen presence is something he would make himself notable with in future roles such as 25th Hour, although there's probably plenty of others that others prefer. Furlong, Brooks, Stacey Keach and Beverley D'Angelo are solid support but the star of the show is really leading it here.<br/><br/>Tony Kaye has delivered an unflinching, shocking, emotionally draining film with a devastating and hopeless conclusion that serves as the real life denounement that there's rarely a happy ending. It set Norton on the path to super stardom and is one of the more shocking dramas out there. *****"

The fruit of hatred is pain, suffering and great loss. Contrary to this, love leads to hope, joy and fulfillment.<br/><br/>Edward Norton is as good as you have heard. He is fantastic in all facets of this complex role, and his performance is no less than a tour-de-force. Edward Furlong has come of age too, with his portrayal of the little brother who idolises everything his big brother has become. The story, about Neo-Nazis and their reign of terror in Los Angeles, is a fictional dramatisation of what is a very real problem.

But the black boy was not, could not be and he killed and was unerasably and permanently sprayed with the blood of his prey and the final vision of a completely red Pacific Ocean of forever waxing and waning blood leads to a meaning of fatality that will never end. Racism is forever because the black victims of white racism will never be redeemed and will never forgive. And why should they?

He told us that all stereotypes are born from some tiny kernel of truth, that right or wrong, stereotypes are born from some sort of relative reality.<br/><br/>So don't be offended by what I have to say. I found the hatred and the violence in Tony Kaye's American History X horrifying and dispiriting, the stuff that makes me look, from time to time, at the human race and think ""pestilence."" Yet, there's just a smidgen of truth in Edward Norton's pep talk to his skinhead followers just before they destroy a grocery store owned and operated by a Korean. There's a nugget of reality in Elliot Gould's attempt at understanding the violence of the 1992 LA riots. Mistreatment garners hate--and a desire for revenge! A government that doesn't enforce what Michael Savage hammers at--language, borders, culture--ceases to serve its constituency. Given the reasons--lame or not--to wage war against our neighbors, we are predisposed to do so.<br/><br/>That's why I think American History X is a great film. It could never be considered by anyone with a shred of maturity as entertainment. It does accomplish one of the critical Six Parts of Drama, penned by Aristotle--it evokes intense thought.<br/><br/>I've had a copy of AHX in my stack-of-movies-to-watch for about a decade, thanks to my video store in-laws who used to give us screeners, and I finally sat down to watch the movie. My preconception was that X was some sort of hoary drive-by gang movie. I really didn't know what to expect, beyond the positive comments by students over the years. I was engrossed by the film, its performances, and its clear and tragic narrative from the start.<br/><br/>Which brings me back to my professor from a quarter century ago at EWU. I liked the guy, the way he was able to tweak our politically correct sensibilities and to get us talking. American History X has that same ability.<br/><br/>He and the movie were wise. Hopefully anyone who sees the movie shares in that wisdom."

","This has been the most influential movie i have seen in my life.It taught me things so as to perceive in different ways.To forget hate & to accept love.<br/><br/>Awesome direction by Tony Kay.One of the best directed films i have seen probably the best after the Godfather part-2.Cinematography is perfect.Also the black-white contrast just sets the mood for the audience. <br/><br/>Unforgetful performance by Edward Norton(Derek).I think this is his best performance up to date.He has proved how dedicated he is to his acting & truly this role deserved an Oscar. Edward Furlong(Doris) also plays a fantastic role.Lending deep emotions in to the role.<br/><br/>This movie will make you feel that in the past if you have wasted your years for no good reasons then please don't waste it now.Becasuse Hate is Baggage.Love can overcome all odds.<br/><br/>Some scenes in the movie will make you feel why you don't get along with your brother that well.Hopefully you can learn and see for yourself. Specially the scene in which Derek takes a bath & the movie takes you back to his childhood days playing side by side with your brother.This will cut you deep.You will feel the pain. <br/><br/>The ending is very good & unpredictable.Soundtrack is fabulous.Will make you feel why you wasted so many good years of your life.

His performance in this film is absolutely haunting - but really, the acting is excellent all-round. Edward Furlong is fantastic as the conflicted yet gifted Danny Vinyard.<br/><br/>This is a film that is powerful, frightening, moving and heartbreaking.

"suicidalicecreamtruckdriver","10","0","2","18 February 2010"," One of those films that makes you think
","American History X isn't a movie just for Americans. I'm Australian, and any country with a history of neo nazism or racism or hate can watch this and understand it. Derek Vineyard (Edward Norton) is seeking revenge after the murder of his firefighting dad. Derek is idolized by Danny, his younger brother (Edward Furlong). I won't give anything away, but take note that this film is split between flash backs and the present (it's easy to tell). This movie isn't preachy, it just tells you the story. It's message is clear and although the movie is full of disturbing, violent scenes, the grim reality of the movie is hard hitting, gritty and unforgettable. Quite simply, American History X is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The performances are amazing from Norton and Furlong as well as Elliot Gould (who plays a Jewish teacher, a short yet memorable performance) It's a rare movie that doesn't shove anything down your throat, but let's you think for days after the credit has rolled.

","Originality must receive a ten on this film, cinema had barely scraped the surface of this subject when an exceedingly exceptional film came along and was mandated to forever hold the title of best Neo-Nazi film. Conceptual direction, writing, and directing are all superb, with effective and original use of black-and-white filming to rival that of Raging Bull. Cinematography was excellent, along with sound. Emotional build up ingeniously misdirected, to add for a real shocker. This is what a real depiction of deep familial turmoil and affection looks like, along with blind racism and prison life. Emotional themes are blind hatred, family love (especially brotherly), rebellion, with underlying tones of atonement, and a hint of depression. Acting is good overall with very good depictions from both Norton and previously unknown Brooks. Overall one of my favorite films of all time, and a must see."

","In the movie American History X, directed by Tony Kaye, the audience learns from the story of two brothers the hardships and root of ignorant racial views. The tale is told from the narration of the misguided youngest brother Danny Vinyard, played by Edward Furlong. During the opening scene the audience gains a full appreciation of the limitless boundaries of racial prejudice and hate. Danny is awoken by two black men breaking into his brother's car so he goes to interrupts his older brother Derek, played by Edward Norton. As Derek tosses his girlfriend off of him we quickly learn his characters radical racial views. With a large swastika on the wall of his bedroom and tattooed to his chest, we realize he is the epitome of a neo-Nazi skinhead. From the anger of his father's death at the hands of a minority and the misguided teaching of his neo-Nazi mentor Cameron Alexander, played by Stacy Keach, Derek unleashes his rage on the two black gang-bangers ultimately landing him in prison for manslaughter. With his best friend and idol Derek in jail, Danny is destined to fall into his brothers footsteps, unless influenced by his principle Dr. Sweeney, played by Avery Brooks, who gives him an assignment of writing a paper on the events surrounding his recently released brother's incarceration. From the beginning of the movie, the director transitions from color to the black and white effectively to capture the significance and realization of Danny and Derek's memories. It is through the memories of Danny we learn about Derek's progression of violence toward minorities. During Danny's quest to fully understand his brother, whose view and opinions have changed since leaving jail, we learn from Derek firsthand about his time behind bars. This technique helps the audience gain a full appreciation of Derek's progression towards hate and his harsh time in prison because it does not glorify what is depicted on screen. During Derek's incarceration he finds out his follow skinheads aren't all that courageous and turns his back on them. For his disrespect they rape him violently in the shower and threaten his life. With no protection and everyone out to get him he forms an unlikely bond with a black inmate and seeks the guidance of his old teacher Dr. Sweeney. Once release from jail Derek begins his journey to leave behind his old ways and educate his younger brother. Although he travels the streets with the same paranoia from prison he may be too late to save Danny from meaningless racially motivated hate crimes. American History X is filmed with the subjective view point similar to that of Gran Torino, directed by Clint Eastwood. The director puts you right into the emotions of the character as they struggle towards learning that their cause is an ignorant ambition. This technique allows us to see firsthand the intimacies of racism and prejudice as both brothers grow to understand the realities of their beliefs. The director hits the social problem of racism head on and leaves us spellbound by the reality of his depiction."
"mcdona07","7","0","2","6 February 2010"," Violent film about a neo-Nazi gang leader
","The story evolves around two brothers, Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) and Danny Vinyard (Edward Furlong) growing up in Los Angeles. Derek becomes involved with a Neo-Nazi gang after his father who was a fireman is killed by a black man while putting out a fire. With an intense rage and hatred for other races and cultures Derek quickly rises through the ranks of the gang. Then one night three black gang members try to steal his pickup truck, but Derek is there to thwart the attempt and ends up brutally killing two of the gang members. Because of the killing Derek is sent away to prison for three years. While there Derek joins the other neo-Nazi inmates, but gets in a argument and is raped by his own gang members. Afterwards Derek is virtually alone except for his one friend Lamont (Guy Torry) a black co-worker in the laundry, who helps him stay safe for the rest of his sentence. After getting released from prison Derek comes home with a new view on race, but finds out that Danny has become very involved with the neo-Nazi gang. Derek is determined to get Danny out of the gang, but is too late when Danny is shot and killed by a black gang member. <br/><br/>American History X tries to show the social problems that are being faced in the poorer neighborhoods of Los Angeles. Similar to Boyz-n the Hood (1991) it shows the violent environment of the inner city with gangs and racial tension. In both of these movies the main characters are intelligent young men who realize that they must get out of this environment before it is too late, and they end up getting killed. <br/><br/>After getting in trouble for writing a paper on Mien Kaumf Danny Vinyard (Edward Furlong) is instructed by the principal of his school Mr. Sweeney (Avery Brooks) to write a paper about his brother Derek (Edward Norton) who was the leader of a neo-Nazi gang before being sent away for three years for murder. In telling the story the director Tony Kaye uses black and white film to show the flashback in time, and narration from Danny to help tell the story of Derek. The black and white filming helps the viewer in realizing what a flashback is and what is happening in the present. Additionally the black and white adds suspense to the film, and to provide an abstract look at Derek's evil past. The narration or voice over by Danny provides the viewer with a better understanding of what is going on in Derek's life when the flashback occurs."
"bahome-653-854387","9","0","2","5 February 2010"," Thought Provoking, Daring Film
","Tony Kaye directed his first feature in ""American History X."" This film explores deep analysis into the cause of race hatred in the United States. He shows the viewers that different races can look at the same evidence, but draw entirely different answers. In a very shocking, violent, opening scene, teen Danny Vinyard, played wonderfully by Edward Furlong, runs to tell his neo-Nazi brother one evening that a gang of thugs are breaking into his car in front of the house. Derek gets his gun and with no caution shoots the young men in their tracks. Tried and found guilty, Derek is sent away for three (3) years in prison, where he gets a completely different outlook as he compares white-power prisoners with a black prisoner named Lamont, played by Guy Torry. The changes within Derek show the positive impact that Lamont has given to him. Meanwhile, Danny, with a shaved head and a radical attitude, seems determined to follow in his big brother's footsteps. With his new skinhead haircut and eye movements, the viewers can witness the hate which is planted in Danny. After Danny writes a positive review of Adolph Hitler, high school principal Sweeney, puts Danny in a course called American History X and tells him to write a paper about his older brother, who was a past student of Sweeney's. This part is shown by flashbacks, with the movie illustrating Danny's account of Derek's life before the night of the shooting.<br/><br/>The main themes that are shown in the movie are affirmative action and racism. The theme of affirmative action is mostly shown through the character of Derek's father. These themes are shown throughout the whole film.<br/><br/>The performances of Edward Norton and Edward Furlong are unbelievable. Edward Norton shows the ability to demonstrate the hatred and development of his character quite convincing. Edward Furlong plays the ""narrator"" and character of Danny. He also shows the development of his character.<br/><br/>The story of ""American History X"" is healing and opens the mind that racism does happen and we never really see how damaging it can be to oneself and others. The film makes it point quite well and gives the message clearly. The director, Tony Kaye, refuses the movie to have a happy ending. With racism and the consequences of it, this kind of behavior can destroy family members for life (i.e. tragedy built from hate and ignorance)."
"sddavis63","8","0","2","2 February 2010"," Powerful, Disturbing And Often Brutal - This Makes Its Point
","Offering both a very disturbing look at the inside workings of a neo- Nazi skinhead group, as well as a powerful reflection on the redemption of one of its former leaders, this is a truly powerful movie that is both disturbing and sobering. Much to my surprise, it was quite fast-paced and never seemed to lose itself in moralizing or philosophizing, although the temptation was there. The story revolves around an assignment given to a local white teenager by his black principal. The teen (Edward Furlong), whose brother was the former skinhead trying to go straight after doing time in prison, had written a book review expressing admiration for Mein Kampf. His principal (Avery Brooks) assigned him to write the story of his brother, focusing on its social significance. That angle could, as I said, have led to a lot of moralizing. Instead, it served as a springboard to a very powerful series of flashbacks detailing the brother's growing involvement in the movement and his experiences in prison that led to him turning around, as well as a bit of the story of him going straight upon his release. The brother was brilliantly played by Edward Norton. The movie is very brutal and violent at times and is frankly not for the faint of heart. It also seems that a lot happens as a result of one assignment that, as I understood the story, had to be done in one night.<br/><br/>Director Tony Kaye made a good decision to film parts of the movie in black and white, which made a powerful statement in itself of the danger of seeing things in simplistic terms. In the end, this isn't a movie that simply attacks the white skinhead movement. It points out the problem of hate for the sake of hate, and, while focusing on the skinhead movement, the point is applicable when applied to black gang bangers or Latino gangs or any other race-based or religion-based hate movement. Hatred is a waste of time and energy - ultimately, hatred is a waste of life, a point powerfully made in the last scenes of the movie. This movie will not leave you feeling good - but that isn't its purpose. It will leave you with an understanding of the pointlessness of living by hate. 8/10"

","I seen this film a few years ago and while i enjoyed it I didn't appreciate it as much. I watched it again recently and I was blown away by what I saw, shocked even. The story itself is so relevant and honest that it hits you hard on so many levels. Its disturbing to realise that there is such hatred in the world. Norton delivers a career defining performance as does Furlong. The rest of the cast are all solid and altogether deliver a powerful piece of cinema. At times throughout the film I had to say to myself did that really happen, is such brutality real? But beyond the violence lies a problem that has been looked at one thousand different times and we still haven't found an answer. Perhaps there never will be an answer, but what we are shown in this film doesn't need an answer, it just needs to be witnessed to be believed. A masterpiece."
"khanbaliq2","7","0","3","7 December 2009"," Edward Norton is absolutely riveting as the menacing skinhead at the center of American History X.
","American History X is an inflated yet gut-slugging film. The story is about a neo-Nazi skinhead (Edward Norton) who sees the error of his ways in prison, and tries to prevent his brother (Edward Furlong) following in his footsteps.<br/><br/>American History X is jolting melodrama about an intelligent racist, which engineers his redemption too cheaply and gets suckered by its own lyric power. The film often seems at war with itself, but that's precisely the quality that makes Norton's performance so riveting. Director Tony Kaye disowned the released version, and claimed that Norton had altered and edited the film to give his role more prominence. Still, it's a compelling and provocative story."

","American History X is about brothers Derek (played by Edward Norton) and Daniel Vinyard (played by Edward Furlong) whose father was a fireman responding to a fire. When reviving to the scene he gets shot by gang members.<br/><br/>This leads to hatred against (mostly immigrants)foreigners from Derek and, being the eldest of the sons, he makes Daniel and the rest of his family grow up in a white supremacy surrounding. This will be shown in the movie many times, for example by hatred against a Jewish teacher who is trying to date his mother. Even though Daniel seems to be OK with the white supremacy surroundings, it's shown that he is more into having friends than being an outcast from his social surroundings. One day black gang members loose a basketball game against Derek's white gang. The looser would not show themselves ever again on the basketball court. This leads to retaliation and some of the black gang members are trying to steal the boy's deceased father's truck in the middle of the night. Daniel sees it and tells to Derek about it. Derek grabs his gun and kills two gang members in a brutal way. Derek is sentenced to prison for three years. Derek has a hard time fitting in to any group in prison and slowly becomes friend of another inmate who is black. This and many other factors make Derek finding him self in an ideological crisis. When he returns from prison reformed, his younger brother Daniel Vinyard who idolizes him is on the brink of becoming a Neo Nazi himself.<br/><br/>Edward Norton and Edward Furlong do a breathtaking performance and you can really feel their repressed feelings and brotherly love for each other. Edward Norton transforms from a hateful Neo-Nazi to an intelligent normal man and does it in a realistic way. Edward Norton shows really good how he is trying to live up to Derek and feeling ashamed about it at the same time.<br/><br/>Other actors like Beverly D'Angelo playing their mother are really good, too. She is being in a living hell after his husband's death and seeing her sons becoming racist. There are lots of smaller parts like Ethan Suplee's role as Seth Ryan, a dumb Derek idolizing, over weight racist, which makes the story just stronger. The movie is really violent in some parts but it is almost a must to keep the feeling so strong.<br/><br/>Tony Kaye does an amazing job directing and timing every shot so that you don't get confused on flashbacks and what is happening at the moment. The movie reminds the viewer that we live in a world of chain reactions that can be transformed into hate and love. The film itself is a sincere and yet unrelentingly harsh look at race hatred in our modern society.<br/><br/>The colour of the people is just what we see but as a human being we are all the same. Colour of the people is just what we see but as a human being we are all the same.<br/><br/>Still, there are some problems. For example Dr. Sweeny (a black teacher) assigns Danny, the younger brother, to write an essay on his family history and his older brother's impact on his life. The paper is a part of what Sweeny calls ""American History X."" The film leads us to believe, then, that the movie a story about Danny. But it isn't. It's Derek's story. I think that it was an unnecessary for Daniel to begin the story or it could have been done better.<br/><br/>Even though the movie is probably one of the best movies of the ninety's and leaves no one cold."
"Sanou_san","10","0","6","4 November 2009"," Unbelievable
","I'm always impressed how cool Edward Norton carry his character in every film his in. This one has to be one of his most deserving performance to receive an award. Certainly one of the few comments I've read, you got hauled into his character. And indeed it proved true. Edward Norton's character has a very captivating aura. In the first place we see him a complete racist freak, who's blinded so much with hatred and rage. Then we see him gradually cools down (when he got in jail). And we finally see a complete shift of his character from a cruel racist to a peaceful friendly man who doesn't care what's your color. Edward Norton had performed this character really well, and I mean truly well. You can feel the imbibed hatred and rage in his heart when he condemns and spit off the existence of blacks in their country. He even had gone to his limits (even hurting his family, blinded by rage), and this gave me the chills! Made me even squirm in my seat! Especially when I saw him so mad in a meal discussion throwing off their viewpoints concerning blacks and other foreign immigrants of their country of who's got the right and who's out. His younger brother in the film, like anyone else idolizes his brother and we see throughout as well how he transformed. I love the structure of the story. The film doesn't only give me the reason to like it because of the actors' ability to portray their role. The story has something in reality, very genuine and sublime. The actions and sequence where also convincing. The drama had all to get you hanging in and staying at your seats. Unquestionably it is one of the best film to portray existent situations in a country. Very moving, very inspiring, unbelievably brilliant."
"kebadatta","10","0","6","20 October 2009"," Not All Black and White
","Tony Kaye's 1998 film, American History X is a powerful and intelligent look at the Neo-Nazi movement in North America, one man's struggle to escape the group he was involved with and prevent his younger brother from going down the same path he did. It is a phenomenally good film, staying in the viewer's mind long after the credits have rolled. The exceptional directing, music and acting are what make it so memorable.<br/><br/>American History X is certainly not the first film to pull out the racism card, nor is it the first film to show change within its characters. It is, however, a story told in such a way that entertains, challenges and moves like no other. A lot can be learned from the story of Derek Vinyard; a man put through various circumstances, is filled with hate and later joins a Neo-Nazi group. Later on, he is imprisoned and despite his initial feelings, eventually befriends a black inmate who challenges his way of thinking. There is a lot that can be learned about humanity through this character, and the later scenes between Derek and Lamont (aforementioned black inmate) are hilarious and heart-warming.<br/><br/>Another great thing about American History X is that it never seems overly preachy, but still manages to make its points clear to all those watching and keeps them totally entertained at the same time. Towards the end, the film does an excellent job of showing the negative effects of hate and violence, and how it can still come back to haunt you even after you may have changed.<br/><br/>Despite all of the other great points about the film, if there was one thing that could be considered the highlight of American History X, it would have to be the acting. Edward Norton in particular is spectacular as Derek Vinyard. The fact that Norton lost the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role to Roberto Benigni is flabbergasting. Norton plays the role of Vinyard with ease, being totally believable first as the racist skin head filled with hate and later as a reformed man, desperate to redeem his wrongdoings and stop his brother from making the same mistakes that he did. His performance here is amazing, even topping his portrayal of the complex Narrator in 1999's Fight Club. Certain scenes, such as his arrest after the infamous ""curb stomp,"" leave you mesmerized, all thanks to his talent. Norton's performance in this film would have to be one of the finest examples of acting I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Even if they do not compare to Norton's, the performances of the other actors and actresses in this film are nothing to be scoffed at. Edward Furlong does a great job as Derek's brother, Danny Vinyard. He is not as skillful as Norton, but still does a great job of portraying an influenced youth, as well as making it believable that his character could change his views with just a little help from Derek. You can really feel the love between these two brothers and the love that they feel for the rest of their family, which makes certain scenes all the more painful and moving.<br/><br/>The actors playing Neo-Nazi characters do a great job as characters you love to hate. These kinds of characters are great when they are both written and played well, and they certainly are here. Stacy Keach is wonderful as the leader of Derek's Neo-Nazi group, Cameron Alexander. Cameron is a lying, cheating racist and Keach does a great job of making the character entertaining and frustrating. Ethan Suplee is always memorable in whatever he does, and American History X proves to be no exception. Seth Ryan is really just another ignorant Neo-Nazi bigot, but Suplee plays the roll in a way that makes the character very entertaining to watch. Faiuza Balk works well as Derek's Neo-Nazi girlfriend, Stacey, who is unopened to the idea of change. William Russ is also worthy of a mention, even if only appearing in one short scene as Derek and Danny's father. This scene is very significant though; as it explains the origins of Derek's hate, and Russ does an excellent job of portraying a man capable of making his son believe in such ideas and ideals. Guy Torry, Avery Brooks, Beverly D'Angelo and Jennifer Lien also deserve mentions for their performances.<br/><br/>The atmosphere of this film is dark, helping to add emotion to the moving storyline. The use of black and white in flashback scenes is very atmospheric and useful towards helping us understand what happened when. The soundtrack by Anne Dudley is also very beautiful and adds emotion to many of the scenes, though none of the tracks used in the film are very memorable. Even after watching the film several times, it is unlikely that the audience would remember any of the melodies of the tracks. Though despite this, the music was very pleasant and fitted well with the film.<br/><br/>American History X is an amazing film with a good, strong message. The acting, direction and general atmosphere is excellent. The ending is also spot-on, showing that hate does not help make anything better and will only come back to haunt you, making things worse for you and those close to you. It is an exceptional piece of work."

","I'm almost embarrassed to admit this, but the first time I watched this movie, I had to leave the room to have a little cry. Only almost embarrassed, because the right wing antics of Ed Norton's main protagonist would probably have made Hitler blush. Norton plays Derek Vinyard, a Neo-Nazi of the Uber variety. This guy really hates black people. The very presence of a black person makes his skin crawl. He rants and raves, sounding wonderfully maniacal, about the blight that is black America, angering and upsetting his family - even though it was his own father that instilled these ideas initially. All, that is, except his younger brother, who looks up to him, admires him, and devours every word of vile rhetoric. One night, Derek carries out an act of ghastly violence against a black criminal - this scene has to be seen to be believed - and winds up in jail. There, his life, his attitudes and his thoughts about the path his younger brother are on are brought into sharp focus. Disturbing, unrelenting, unflinching and as harrowing a movie as you are ever likely to see. Black, white, yellow or an odd shade of mauve, everyone MUST watch this movie. You won't think the same way afterwards."

Whoever wants credit, Kaye or Norton, made an incredibly layered and brilliant film.<br/><br/>American History X shows the fall of Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton), a bright and persuasive young man, into the blame and hate of neo-Nazi skinhead gangs. After a few years in prison, Derek has seen the error in his ways and he tries to cut his ties with his former gang, keep his family safe, and he must keep his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) from walking down the same path of anger.<br/><br/>As soon as the film began, I was drawn in and taken for an emotional roller-coaster. It is an intricate weave of family, brotherhood, redemption, and anger all stitched together with racism and culture. Maybe it's because I have an older brother, but the relationship between Derek and Danny is incredibly realistic and touching. Derek is Danny's hero, just like my older brother was my hero growing up, which makes it hard to watch as Danny follows in his brothers footsteps of hatred. The damage of Derek's involvement with the neo-Nazi on his family is also documented very well throughout the movie, and it makes you wonder when is it to late for redemption and what happens when your past sins finally catch up with you? Edward Norton is an incredible actor, and he gives his absolute best performance here. It is chilling just how convincing he is when he justifies his racism. The entire supporting cast does a great job as well, especially Ethan Suplee who plays a fat, stupid, and incredibly racist skinhead. This film is cut and put together extremely well, highlighted by great shots of Venice Beach and slow motion capturing all the emotions felt by the characters. This is all topped off by an incredible score composed of a great orchestra and choir.<br/><br/>It is almost impossible to find anything negative about this movie. Maybe a couple of lines from small characters like a prison guard aren't delivered too well, but that's about it. This film is perfection. It is so incredibly emotional from beginning to end, and is just put together so well, that this is one of the best movies I have ever seen, and I don't say that a lot. I highly recommend American History X to anyone and everyone. This is one of the only times I have ever given out a perfect score for a movie.<br/><br/>10/10"

"tjsdshpnd","9","0","3","17 June 2009"," Controverial but a must watch
","To start off, this was an extremely controversial movie when it was released.Maybe because of the racist, anti-black, anti-immigration, anti-Jewish, anti-Asian, anti- Hispanic etc etc remarks made continuously in the movie. This movie is actually divided into two parts and has a non-linear style of narration. The two parts being the flashback and the current scenario. The director has interestingly given a different look to both the parts with the help of colors. The flashback is depicted by black and white frames while the current part is depicted by normal color. <br/><br/>The movie contains violence, sometimes very gory violence that may turn your eyes off the screen. It contains some statements which you may not agree with. But as a movie, it is a complete experience. The transition of the protagonist from a racial, neo-nazi skinhead to a caring, understanding guy who understands that it is not the color that determines a person, but his nature is put very underminingly by the director. His urge to stop his brother from going his way and spoil his life is depicted wonderfully. The part of the story in jail where Norton understands that he is wrong and has a radical transformation was done without preaching and high melodrama which is the case with many other movies.<br/><br/>On the acting front, Edward Norton is anyways one of my favorite actors and in this movie all his acting prowess is put to the test and without any surprise he delivers . All the other actors especially Edward Furlong fit the bill perfectly . In short Controversial but a must watch <br/><br/>Rating : 8.5/10"

","The movie American History X explains the life of a former neo-Nazi/ skinhead who is trying to keep his younger brother from becoming a racist and committing the same mistakes he did before he was sent to jail.<br/><br/>Derek Vineyard, played by Edward Norton, is a very troubled young man whose father basically raised him to be violent and have hatred against other people of various ethnicities. After being imprisoned for murdering two black men, Derek finally notices that not just African Americans and Jews are to blame for everything that goes on in the world. When coming out of jail, Derek is determined to speak out to his younger brother Danny. Since looking up to his brother Derek was very important to him, Danny ended up following all of Derek's ideas and who other ethnicities are the problem in the world.<br/><br/>The actors in the movie have done a very great job in portraying the characters. Edward Norton does a phenomenal job portraying the character Derek Vineyard in the movie. His emotional change from being a gang leader of a white supremacist to a man who is enlightened by good ideas and not using other ethnicities as scapegoats is very transitioning in the movie. Actor Avery Brooks also does an outstanding job playing Dr. Bob Sweeny a principal who enforces hard work into his students.<br/><br/>The view and the scenery of the movie makes people feel like their part of what's going on the in the movie. There are also many intense scenes, but I rather not spoil it for people who are going to watch the movie. Although there is a lot of foul language, the movie is made in an impeccable and interesting way.<br/><br/>I think that people should go ahead and rent this movie. It is a very great movie and people could learn from it. This would be a very go movie for people who like drama, action, and very intense conflicts. It can also be a lesson for younger viewers that using hatred and violence against people can't get you anywhere, so go ahead and watch the movie. You will be amazed."

The movie's more direct message goes to show what pain and misery racial prejudice and hate can bring. <br/><br/>There are some very violent scenes, but if these things are used in the right way, they just underline the power with which the movie delivers its message and I can truthfully state that in American History X, they do."

","American HISTORY X is so powerful, so engrossing, so well-acted, that I sat in silence for some time after the last credit rolled past. The message of hate and how it affects generations is something so true and ingrained in our culture that it often defies logic. And so goes this film...<br/><br/>Based on the true-life story of a white supremacist, Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton, THE PAINTED VEIL), the story leads us down a path many would probably not rather see, but must see in order to understand what hateful ignorance lay in wait in America (and beyond).<br/><br/>After killing some black men trying to break into his car, Derek is sent to prison for several years, leaving his family to fend for themselves. Most notable is impressionistic brother Danny (Edward Furlong) who practically worships brother Derek. In high school, Danny taunts students of color and creates a few enemies that will ultimately be his undoing.<br/><br/>Trying to save both Derek and Danny is high school principal Bob Sweeney (Avery Brooks), a black man on a mission to salvage the men from hatred (a great role for Brooks, too, second only to Norton's amazing performance).<br/><br/>In prison, Derek learns a humbling lesson: those that are supposed to be your friends can be your worst enemies, and true friends can be color-blind. Derek becomes friends with an unlikely laundry buddy ...who happens to be black. The two form a bond based on trust and understanding, and a love for sports talk. Derek is surprised when he actually survives his prison term, only to learn that his survival was helped along by his friend of color. Derek has awakened to his loss of hatred of colored people (and Jews), and realizes that he has to try and save brother Danny from a similar fate.<br/><br/>But can he...<br/><br/>Edging his way back into the family, Derek distances himself from his disturbing past, but will it be in time to save his beloved skinhead brother? <br/><br/>Without a doubt, the film's ending can be viewed as fatalistic. We don't know what Derek is going to do but we are left with an inkling of hope that he'll stay true on his new path. Whether he would or not is left up to the audience to decide.<br/><br/>Which is why I remained sitting, staring at a black screen after the credits finished rolling. I wanted to see my hopeful thoughts come true; to see Derek rise up and defeat his demons. I didn't want to see what 'might' happen.<br/><br/>I hope...<br/><br/>An incredibly powerful performance by Norton and an even more powerful message of (possible) redemption ...with a terrible cost."

","""American History X"" focuses on a pair of brothers, both with ties to a neo-nazi skinhead group. Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) returns from an eye-opening prison stint to find that his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) is following in his footsteps. Derek is committed to saving his family from further heartache but he soon finds that his past cannot easily be left behind.<br/><br/>The cast is a pretty good one and features Edward Norton in an Oscar-nominated role. There are some other notable names and familiar faces but for the most part the acting isn't particularly remarkable. Perhaps the best supporting performance comes from Stacy Keach as manipulative white supremacist Cameron Alexander.<br/><br/>Back when the film was released, director Tony Kaye tried to have his name taken off of it, supposedly because Edward Norton had recut the film. If that is indeed true I can't say that it hurt the film, though I suppose that we'll never know for sure. Kaye's direction indulges in a few flourishes but typically he keeps things simple. I'm not crazy about the stylistic choice of shooting the flashback scenes in black and white but others may not share my opinion.<br/><br/>All things considered, the film is a powerful one, though the story isn't without a few faults. Some of the plot points seem a bit manufactured but the story is compelling and the ending packs an undeniable punch. I recommend the film though I think that it's a tad overrated."

The scene around the family table is true-to-life and instructive for families who endeavor to avoid the poison of prejudice and hate from scarring their homes.<br/><br/>Alex Sol and Nicholas R.

I think it is wrong, but that opinion is unable to be proved. Many people have fought for civil rights, such as President Abraham Lincoln and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr..<br/><br/>Derick Vineyard (Edward Norton) was seduced into the world of Neo-Nazi skinheads as a teenager.

At the end of Derick's career as a skinhead, he brutally killed two African-Americans that try to steal his car and is imprisoned for three years. When he comes out, he is completely rehabilitated but his brother, Daniel (Edward Furlong) is going down the same path. Derick decides that he must stop his brother from going down that path before it is too late.<br/><br/>Norton deserved his Oscar nomination for this film. There is no question about it. I have probably never seen a movie that produces such a good argument about the topic. It really shows the effects that racism has on a family.<br/><br/>All of the acting is good.

","American History X is definitely a film that will make the question come to mind. Just what has America come to? When your children can be so easily manipulated by stereotypes from others, and the media, and then turn that manipulation into a full blown belief, you just know that something is wrong.<br/><br/>Edward Norton delivers a phenomenal role as Derek Vinyard, a young Venice Beach resident who transforms into a heartless and ruthless skinhead after his racist father is killed by a black man while trying to put out a fire in South Central Los Angeles.<br/><br/>Edward Norton, while not regularly taking a villainous role, truly comes across as an nonnegotiable force of prejudiced evil in this film, even adorned with a memorable and gigantic swastika tattoo on his chest. Joining the misled youth during his tirade of hatred is the long lost Stacy Keach from M.A.S.H. as his white supremacist mentor, Cameron Alexander, who could very well become Venice Beach's own version of Adolf Hitler, a sly and evil man who uses his words and connections to reach out to frustrated youths, and rally them to his pure Nazi-esquire campaign.<br/><br/>Also joining the pure white army is ""My Name Is Earl""s very own Ethan Supplee as the massive and short-tempered skinhead Seth, who can't help but gnaw away at all the viewers nerves, as he takes his hatred on other white people, rather than ONLY non-whites.<br/><br/>Terminator 2's Edward Furlong also delivers a powerful role as Derek's impressionable younger brother Danny, who is well on his way to becoming just like his brother.<br/><br/>This film is highly praised in my eyes, as it displays just how destructive racism is, not only to strangers, but also to those closest to you. A truly horrific scene, that will no doubt last forever, is when a furious Edward Norton drags a wounded black gangster to the concrete curb in front of his house, and mercilessly curb stomps his skull to the ground, and then grinning innocently as he is taken away by the police, as if he has done nothing wrong.<br/><br/>Only until it is too late, and he is in prison, does Derek slowly realize the mistakes he has made in his life, especially after he is viciously raped in the showers by the local Aryan Brotherhood, and brought to his senses by his black former teacher.<br/><br/>Upon returning to the real world, Derek tries his best to try and bring the old Danny back to his family, as the new skinhead Danny is very quickly going down the same road Derek once went down. Needless to say, his former Nazi friends do NOT take Derek's change of heart well at all.<br/><br/>In a climactic, and earth shattering finale, Derek finally convinces Danny not to follow in his brother's footsteps, and they both decide to begin a hate-free life, but only to have Danny mercilessly gunned down in his school bathroom by a young black kid.<br/><br/>Truly, hatred only begets hatred, and that lesson is very vividly shown in this masterpiece. American History X is a film that is to be seen by everyone at least once. If you have a family member, or friend, who is slowly succumbing, or showing signs of prejudice or hatred towards non white people, and beginning to take Nazi-like beliefs to heart, show them this film ASAP, so they'll know not to make those mistakes.<br/><br/>American History X is truly a classic, and is to be respected as such."

"brando647","8","0","1","16 February 2009"," A Powerful Message About Hate
","Here is a film with a powerful message. In his first feature film, Tony Kaye has created a gripping drama that tackles the subject of hate and racism in America. Edward Norton is Derek Vinyard, a charismatic leader in a White Supremecist organization in Venice Beach who is imprisoned for murder. Upon his release, he intends to turn his life around but discovers that his younger brother has fallen in with the same Neo-Nazi organization. A fantastic cast and a strong message come together in this ever-relevant film.<br/><br/>Edward Norton deserved more awards for his performance in this movie. For those wondering why I easily consider Norton one of my favorite actors in modern film, Kaye's movie is a prime example. Norton is such a strong performer that one can actually start to understand the racist rhetoric he spouts in the film and for an example of the passion/animosity he summoned for the role, one only needs to see the look on his face when Vinyard is arrested. While Norton is definitely a powerhouse, the film boasts an equally impressive supporting cast including Edward Furlong, Avery Brooks, Beverly D'Angelo, Stacey Keach, and Elliot Gould.<br/><br/>The film portrays a powerful message of how hate and violence will only lead to further hate and violence. The main characters are led to discover how meaningless the cause they fight for actually is and the repercussions of their actions. The final few minutes caught me off guard, as I definitely wasn't expecting the ending. While some feel the end to be meaningless, or even counter-productive to the film's theme, I disagree (but I hesitate to go into greater detail at risk of spoilers). Your best bet would be to check out the film and form your own opinion, as the film is sure to inspire thought.<br/><br/>On one final note, did anyone else find it odd to see Ethan Suplee in the role of a hate-monger? To his credit though, he did a great job."

"ODDBear","10","0","2","10 February 2009"," Absolutely riveting
","This is one powerful movie. Not only is this movie an excellent showcase of dangerous thinking but also the misguided ways and wisdom that led to it.<br/><br/>Edward Norton's performance is nothing short of spectacular, playing basically two versions of the same man. Utterly convincing and extremely menacing as the hateful C.O.D. leader, recruiting armies of impressionable people in the fight against society's parasites. Completely convinced in his cause, there's no better soldier for White Power. Norton's equally convincing as the broken down, fully repentant ""born again"" man released from prison, after committing a brutal act of violence.<br/><br/>There's no sugar coating here; Norton is as brutal as they come. An intellectual filled with hatred finds just the right place to vent it and his mentor (a slimy and effective Stacey Keach) pushes all the right buttons.<br/><br/>No less effective is Edward Furlong, as Norton's impressionable younger brother. Idolizing his brother, Furlong attempts to impress his brother by following in his footsteps, though it's somewhat apparent that he's not at all like his brother in way of thinking. He can be force fed, but ultimately with right guidance he could be steered in the right direction.<br/><br/>Also interesting here is the film's statement about where the evil seed is sown. At a casual conversation at dinner time, the hard working father of Norton explains (somewhat clumsily) to him to question things and not take things simply at face value. Displaying some irritation over affirmative action the father exposes some racial concerns that may be attributed to racism. But the overall impression of the man is that he's decent, with some strong viewpoints which all may not agree with, but the scene clearly implies that racism can be passed on. Once his father dies in a shooting, the troubled son focuses his rage in all the wrong places and a figure like Keach provides him a dangerous feeding ground to nurture his rage.<br/><br/>But this rage only taints his soul and causes sorrow and heartbreak for all around him and in the end proves quite costly.<br/><br/>American History X is a sobering look at a massive world wide problem and it makes a strong case for what kind of people get involved with a cause like White Supremacy. Troubled or alienated kids, looking for a place in a detached cold world could easily find solidarity in a group like this. The same can apply for almost any group, be it a community of gay people, religious groups or activists against seal killing, whatever, people look to belong to some kind of community. The trouble here is that these people breed a dangerous, dividing way of thinking and, at worst, killers for a very misguided cause.<br/><br/>American History X is one of those must-see movies. I cannot recommend it enough. Rambling over."

His performance dominates the film ,American History X is passionate and compelling, It holds together as a horrifying portrait of youth swept up by the finger-pointing and easy answers of Neo-Nazism.<br/><br/>Here's a beautiful Quote from the Movie <br/><br/>"" So I guess this is where I tell you what I learned - my conclusion, right? Well, my conclusion is: Hate is baggage. Life's too short to be ****** off all the time. It's just not worth it. Derek says it's always good to end a paper with a quote. He says someone else has already said it best. So if you can't top it, steal from them and go out strong. So I picked a guy I thought you'd like. 'We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory will swell when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature. """

","This is a film that once had a massive impact on me, a film I used to consider perfect. It achieves many tones with a very well developed protagonist, giving us many situations in when we hate him and what he's done and then sympathize with him. Edward Norton deals with this transition with perfection and makes it 100% believable (even if it takes a rape to do it). The use of flashbacks is effective, and it helps that they are clearly separate (though a cause of the consequence because the actual retelling of the film is set within around 24 hours - this stretch gives us a value of time and helps us re-evaluate the characters). Furlong is equally as powerful giving his only notable performance besides Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Despite the strength of the film within itself in the narrative, the actual message is thin. Not weak, but thin. It seems to blurt out the message at every opportunity, giving almost a before and after of his thoughts in his behaviour. However, the protagonist preaches about racism, it's effected his whole life, but when he encounters a black person face to face on his own his reaction is calmed down and he seems to want to just leave and not take action; which contradicts his feelings. I must admit, there is not a moment in this film that I would give the label ""entertaining"", despite how often engaging it is. Which also makes it boring every time it stops being engaging. The end is the source of the emotional punch which almost alters the films' (or the characters') point and feels rather forced. The fact Tony Kaye actually wanted to disown the film limits my respect for it.<br/><br/>7/10"

","Movies like this are the kind of movies which should really be gaining big money at the box office. American History X took around 28million, although for what its worth more people should see this film. Its not simply about redemption and black movement vs. white movement (of which my depth of knowledge is inadequate anyway), its about standing up for a belief.<br/><br/>American History X is a reminder to the viewer that; what is popular is not always right, and what is right is not always popular.<br/><br/>The change in Danny Vinyard is played out by Edward Norton extremely well, and his performance in American History X should be seen as one of his finest. Likewise Edward Furlong played his role quite well, they make a great on screen duo, Furlong should star in more movies like this, it allows him to bring back that rebellious terminator 2 boyhood charm - which can only be done by him.<br/><br/>This movie is an integral part of my DVD collection. And although violent and brutal, it displays the harsh realities of life in a beautiful way - those kinds of movies I love and respect."

But this movie will explain their thoughts about immigrants very clearly. Edward Norton and Edward Furlong does a perfect role as a neon-Nazi. At the beginning Edward Norton - 'Derrek' Kills 2 black people when they steal his car, that belonged to his father. He goes to jail for 3 years, and when being in there, he will change big time.

","Edward Norton stars as Derek Vinyard in American History X (1998); a gripping story of a man who leads a group of young white supremacists. After being released from jail for a brutal hate crime, Derek quickly tries to right the wrongs he's committed in his life before they affect the people he loves. Can Derek save the life of his younger brother Danny, headed down the same direction he has gone, while simultaneously trying to keep himself away from his past and the dangers that come along with it? Edward Norton and Edward Furlong star in this disturbing yet insightful story directed by Tony Kaye. Set in Venice Beach, Kaye shows us a suburban town which is quickly being filled with racial diversity. The tensions between characters are built slowly throughout but not slow enough to take you out of the film. We see this development in much of the movie's lighting techniques. Going from a bright beach town, to the dark backstreets, the movie is defined by Norton's brilliant portrayal of a troubled youth guided down the wrong path of lies and deception. The dialogue is powerful and deals with racism issues that are occurring in American society to this day. Tony Kaye and writer David McKenna are not afraid to push the limits of acceptable language to get their point across. The movie keeps viewers enticed throughout the entire length of the film. Most of the production keeps you on the edge of your seat with an anxious feeling waiting to see what will happen to the characters with whom you seem to gradually develop a connection. The music simply adds to the mood when we listen to orchestrated pieces which leave us with a sense of approaching danger. American History X is a well balanced film with Norton's strong character and his younger brother Danny's innocent yet brain-washed personality. While Furlong is not as convincing of an actor, his performance still has enough to get you lost within the movie. Though the R-rating should be a good enough indication, be aware that the dialogue may be somewhat offensive to some viewers, so it's best to have an open mind throughout the movie. At first, the writer makes you feel as if it is nothing more than a hate-filled movie with no point to the offensive racial slurs. We quickly learn the movie's moral value which overall is what makes the movie a must-see. Through half of the movie, we hear Danny provide narration in the form of an essay which he owes to his history teacher Dr. Sweeny who takes an interest in trying to help Danny and Derek realize the error of their ways. Through this paper we learn a lot about Danny's real emotions and thoughts about his life and the people in it. As Derek tells his story, Kaye uses a black and white display to show flashbacks in the life of Danny and Derek. Through the flashbacks, we slowly learn the reasoning behind the characters' actions and hatred towards other ethnicities. Another great element used are eye-level camera angles which give us a better sense of what is running through Derek's head as he delivers some of the most powerful speeches ever heard in a movie. The movie deserves a 5 out of 5 star rating overall for its portrayal of a racist young man who is only driven by pain and misunderstanding. Though the cinematography may be lacking quality as far as uniqueness goes, it's quickly made up for by one of Edward Norton's best performances of his career. For anyone who enjoys good moral values, the movie is an excellent way to explain how misunderstanding can lead to dire thoughts."

","What has to happen to transform a committed member of a skin head gang into a person willing to die to free his family from his mistakes? In American History X (1998), rated R for graphic brutal violence including rape, pervasive language, strong sexuality, and nudity, the story focuses on Derek Vinyard as he struggles to overcome the hate taught to him by his father and friends. The movie has a powerful message that steers clear of becoming a clichÃ©d story about everybody getting along. It is a very dark movie that deals with very powerful themes such as racism and hate and also the ability to overcome these feelings. While the movie can at times feel rushed it is overall a very good movie that shows the transformation of one man and his family.<br/><br/>In this movie all of the characters look the part of skinheads and racists, with shaved heads and clothing bearing the pictures and slogans of hate. Derek has gone one step further than this; he has covered himself in tattoos of swastikas, SS lightning bolts, and other symbols of hate. One of the most powerful scenes in this movie comes when Derek stands in front of the mirror after being released from prison and covers up the large swastika tattoo over his heart with his hand. Also when Derek is released from prison he also begins to let his hair grow out again, no longer keeping his head shaved, showing in one more way that he has changed and that he no longer agrees with the ideologies of the skinheads.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is excellent. Edward Norton played the character of Derek perfectly. In the flashbacks it was almost scary to watch him as he spewed racism and hate. You got the sense that this was real. In playing Danny, Edward Furlong also did a very good job, portraying the younger brother striving for his older brother's affection and respect extremely well. The rest of the supporting characters were also very well done, all the characters seemed believable and you never questioned whether the hate they had was real.<br/><br/>While the movie has several small, mainly cosmetic flaws, it is still a very good movie with an inspiring plot line. It is a powerful movie of love and redemption."

","American History X. This is the kind of film that will stay with you for a long time. Controversial, yes. Disturbing, yes. Eye-opener as well, yes. This movie was the perfect example of how much a person's feelings of prejudice can hurt people, whether it be to themselves, or to those around them. Although this movie was very brutal in it's violence and language, those elements were not just thrown in randomly. They were what really made the movie, while controversial, also extremely well done. It was a harsh look at how much racism can damage a family and the people they love. The Cinematography was beautiful, with flashbacks shot in black and white. Tony Kaye did a superb job directing and he really showed his talent for making a touching film. The script was very well-written; harsh and stinging at times but very clever and profound. Edward Norton gave the performance of his career in my opinion, besides Primal Fear (both of which got him nominated at the Academy Awards for Best Actor). Also Edward Furlong shines as Edward Norton's younger brother, Danny. Stacy Keach, Elliot Gould, Avery Brooks, and Beverly D'Angelo also give very good performances. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to see how much damage hatred can inflict on those who have it in their hearts. Hands down, a must see 10 out of 10."

","""His father taught him to hate. His friends taught him rage. His enemies gave him hope."" <br/><br/>Tony Kaye made his feature directorial debut with this dramatic exploration into the roots of race hatred in America. In a shocking opening scene, teen Danny Vinyard (Edward Furlong) races to tell his older brother, neo-Nazi Derek (Edward Norton), about the young blacks breaking into his car in front of the house, whereupon Derek gets his gun and with no forethought shoots the youths in their tracks. Tried and convicted, Derek is sent away for three years in prison, where he acquires a different outlook as he contrasts white-power prisoners with black Lamont (Guy Torry), his prison laundry co-worker and eventual pal. Meanwhile, Danny, with a shaved head and a rebellious attitude, seems destined to follow in his big brother's footsteps. After Danny writes a favorable review of Hitler's Mein Kampf, black high-school principal Sweeney (Avery Brooks) puts Danny in his private ""American History X"" course and assigns him to do a paper about his older brother, who was a former student of Sweeney's. This serves to introduce flashbacks, with the film backtracking to illustrate Danny's account of Derek's life prior to the night of the shooting. Monochrome sequences of Derek leading a Venice, California gang are intercut with color footage of the mature Derek ending his past neo-Nazi associations and attempting to detour Danny away from the group led by white supremacist, Cameron (Stacy Keach), who once influenced Derek. Director Tony Kaye, with a background in TV commercials and music videos, filmed in L.A. beach communities. Rated R ""for graphic brutal violence including rape, pervasive language, strong sexuality and nudity.""<br/><br/>American History X is a powerful statement to modern society. Racism have always been a sensitive subject to tackle and not since Schindler's List have we seen this powerful of a film be presented with such potency. Edward Norton shines in his role as Neo-Nazi white supremacist skin-head Derek Vinyard. He was able to adapt to his character both physically and emotionally. Playing as his brother Danny, Edward Furlong sizes up to Norton's intensity and was able to spar acting wits with him.<br/><br/>The touch of black & white was a nice addition as well. Director Tony Kaye gave the film a grim look and his eye for visual style was impressive as well. The ending is cringe-worthy. Believe me, you will not laugh or smirk as the film reaches its tragic conclusion.<br/><br/>American History X is a must-see. You will not be disappointed."

","Though I believed that the film was extremely well done, and very entertaining, I absolutely cannot believe that almost everyone on this page has failed to see its overall racist perspective. Let me explain.<br/><br/>First off, this film gives an amazing amount of statistics, whether they be true or false, that support racism as a system, especially when regarding the black community. This would be acceptable if there was something to in fact balance this racism out. However, there is not. All the viewer is given is a bowl 5h!t story of how Derik is ""saved"" by a black man in jail. This is completely circumstantial, and leaves nothing but an unlikely story for the viewer, in addition to cold hard facts that support bigotry. I find this extremely offensive, in that there are dozens of reasons why racism is wrong, but how many reasons (facts) are given in the movie? None. Every slight attempt to oppose racism through debate is shot down, aside from Sweeny's questioning which is again circumstantial (has being a skinhead helped Derrrikk). Finally, the ending of the movie is absolutely ridiculous. Instead of being rewarded for change, Norton is given a deceased brother. Are we to believe that this does not rekindle racist thought for Derik? It takes years to erase bigotry, but only one incident to rekindle it. Though some may doubt this assumption, I have hard evidence to prove my point. One of the proposed endings of the film was supposed to replace Danny's conclusion speech, with further plot. The final scene takes place back at the Vinyard's. In this shot, Derik is pictured with a towel over his head, starring at his swastika in the mirror. After cutting to a shot of hair inside of his sink, the camera returns to Derik, where he removes the towel and reveals the ""unthinkable."" He is now a skinhead again. And why shouldn't he be? Death of a family member is what sparked up this train of thought, and why should this fail to continue. After all, violence is portrayed as a vicious circle in this film anyways. One final thing that may sway your opinion as to how American History X is in fact racist, not ""Liberating,"" is the quarrel behind the scenes; between Kaye and Norton. You can look this up yourself, but just keep in mind, i did not come to this conclusion out of nowhere. AHX is fricking racist, despite the intentions of many involved with it. Norton's charisma, coupled with the plot itself exploit this, and I hope some of you can get your head out of your azzes and try to think past the surface."

This drama chronicles the life and beliefs of Derek(Norton) and Daniel(Furlong) Vinyard (told through an essay which Daniel was required to write for his black teacher Mr Sweeney, Avery Brooks), who are members of a white supremacist group. After many years hard time in prison, Derek's views are drastically changed and he tries to convince his brother that the Neo Nazi way of life is wrong.<br/><br/>Deeply touching and saddening at times, American History X is a very dark drama and not for the feint of heart, but one that needs to be experienced by everyone.

Honestly.<br/><br/>I first watched this film projection on a festival that was doing a school. The room was filled over to the top. But, actually at the middle of the movie some people really went out. Specially, two girls. They went out crying as hell. But, anyway, that's another story.<br/><br/>American History X is directed by British director Tony Kaye and written by David McKenna. Is about a racist, Derek, (wonderfully played by an impeccable Edward Norton) that wants to 'clean' (let's put it that way) its neighbourhood of colour people (I am not a racist) and Mexicans and all. But after he is arrested for killing two colour people (and crushed it's head to one of them) he reforms of what he has do. But, his little brother, Danny, (played by an excellent Edward Furlong) is following Derek's steps. But Derek will do anything (even go back and look, in a metaphorical way, to his disturbing and terrifying past).<br/><br/>Verdict: An stunning and truly terrifying movie, with magnificent performances, excellent music and beautiful photography, that you won't soon forget. An instant classic. Edward Norton's performance is one of the best of the history of cinema. An extreme odyssey. Definitely, one of the most daring movies of the last 100 years. It's a shame that I can only give 10 stars to this movie. I would give it 1 000 or a million or all the stars in the world. A masterpiece. One of the best pictures ever made.

","It's important to retain a sense of objectivity throughout this film, which keeps skewing and provoking reaction and consideration with controversial situations, imagery and dialogue that explores the dangerous and volatile issue of racism and social tensions in brutal depth. it's not perfect but in dealing with such complex and deeply rooted societal flaws, prejudices and ignorance it tests the viewer and forces lengthy consideration and discussion. it is an engaging, magnificently powerful and important article.<br/><br/>Norton steals the show with his fierce and terrifyingly focused portrayal of young front leader Derek Vinyard, while John Connor - a perfectly cast Furlong - plays his impressionable brother Danny, handed a special assignment by his black head-teacher, to write an examination of the racial hostility issue relating to Derek, his family and society in modern America. Derek is released from prison that day.<br/><br/>what unfolds is a compelling story brought together through flashbacks, dialogue, confrontations and self reflection that does not hold back, a difficult amalgam of social conflict that plays out in the most destructive and devastating way possible to examine the reactions of the participants. Derek's was a once prosperous family in a nice house, until fire-fighting father was shot putting out a blaze at a crack den; Derek allied with the manipulative Cameron, asserting his dominance playing a black gang off the basketball court. at school Danny defends Malcolm in the middle Francis from a couple of black kids, which will have repercussions.<br/><br/>the cinematography and shot selection is crisp and evocative and important scenes are slowed down for maximum impact; a haunting choir and score reinforces the conflagrations, murders and epiphanies that yank this movie from hope to despair, hard-line racism to bright-eyed acceptance. the flashbacks appear in black and white, a none-too-subtle nod towards the racial conflict this film deals with, as well as a contrast with the colourful present; in the past things seemed clear-cut. due to events, relationships and revelations, Derek and by extension Danny through his assignment see through the hypocrisies; it's a lot more complicated then the sheep mentality of the conflicts and societal effects involving gangs, immigrants, community and country.<br/><br/>Derek violently killed 2 of 3 Crips who tried to rob his dad's car, enraging him to gleefully perform that brutal curb-stomp; he got 3 years. Danny goes to a party held to honour Derek's release but Derek defiantly attempts to turn his mind from the vengeful Neo-Nazism fostered by Cam, the suitably repulsive Seth etc. and onto their family, now living in a cheap apartment, struggling onwards. we are treated to flashbacks of Derek discussing social problems at dinner with a focused ferocity that underpins the misguided anger fuelling it, a store robbery he lead and his difficult time in prison, which includes an unlikely friendship with a cheeky black guy who ended up protecting him when the crew of whites that did turned away, ironically because he rejected their pseudo-Neo-Nazism, and symbolically raped him. that head-teacher came to help him, and he renounced his formerly racist ways.<br/><br/>in the morning the police corner Derek to help them with the supremacists, which he is reluctant to do after warning Cam off the previous night, causing a standoff and an escape after which he enlightens Danny to his time in jail and his revelations. they and Danny's insightful and reflective paper are for nought as he is shot in the school toilets by the black kid he stood up to the previous day. Derek cradles him and asks 'what have i done' crying hysterically, the chain of vengeful violence perpetuated in spite of the enlightenment embraced by the Vinyards.<br/><br/>the film only concentrates on the Neo-Nazi side of the issue, creating an imbalance realised when the Crip kids bully Francis and 'smoke' Danny for defending him. they are as aggressively and tragically misguided as the Nazis who oppose them and lament their co-existence, but a lack of focus on them creates an imbalance in the morals the film promotes. Derek is also quick to feel remorse for killing the guys who were, after all, robbing his car, one of whom would have shot him when he opened his door if he hadn't shot the guy first.<br/><br/>the film preaches. if it's not Cam, Derek or Seth, it's the head-teacher. the messages are deceptively attractive and seemingly insightful, like when Derek pigeonholes minorities for social problems and unemployment, then destroying the store, beating up the employees, which presents the blind siege mentality of the rhetoric. it may be somewhat narcissistic that Norton edited more of himself into the film, causing the director to sue no less, but he is definitely the vehicle that drives the twisting perspective, and his fury is riveting.<br/><br/>there is one compelling scene featuring his father reacting negatively towards his reading list, given by that head-teacher, veering from a completely acceptable and justified assertion - the black guys shouldn't have been hired ahead of the white guys who got better scores - to dangerous diatribe - conspiracy involving blacks. this bit of dialogue highlights how complicated and delicately poised the issue is, at all levels, at home, on the basketball court, school, prison, in all society.<br/><br/>this film is as complicated as the issue it's trying to deconstruct, a memorable and ambiguous study that transcends the preaching and brutality and permeates the very direction and intentions of the film itself. it doesn't focus on the black gangs and completely ignores Hispanics, Orientals etc. besides the store attack, but this reflects how skewed the issue is.<br/><br/>hopefully, through the poignant and genuinely painful tragedy that befalls our heartily acted protagonists, the viewer can perceive the utter pointlessness and horrific waste of the hostility from all sides that breeds the problem. if not, the viewer should watch this masterpiece again, for it is a spectacular study of the issue."

","American History X is in my mind a modern classic, a must see film. It is a social commentary, looking at real relations and the American prison and education systems. It was well written, well directed, but most of all, brilliantly acted.<br/><br/>American History X tell two stories. The first is about Danny Vinyard (Ed Furlong), a teenage member of neo-Nazis in Venice Beach, California, as he goes deeper into the crowd. The other story is about Derek (Ed Norton), a young leader of the neo-Nazis who kills two black men who try to steal his car and tell his story of his life in the group and prison. The film starts with a flash back where the Danny see the black men trying to steal the car and tell his brother who he idolises. Danny sees Derek brutally murder the two men before getting arrested. The film then goes to the present day where Danny writes book report on Mein Kampt in a positive way. This obviously gets him in trouble with his school and he is told to write a new report was going to be taught one-to-one by the African American principal Dr. Sweeney (Avery Brooks). On the same day Derek is released from prison, a reformed man. Everyone in the family was worried about Danny, and don't want him to go down the road. The neo-Nazis try to bring Danny deeper into the fold and get back Derek, but Derek fights this and tells his younger brother everything that happened to him and how his personal ideology had changed.<br/><br/>This is a powerful movie and I thought that it was great ever since I saw it on televisions years ago. It tackles touch issues and is brutal in its approach. It is a very well made and a great example of indie film making. It is a shame that Tony Kane has done another film and distances himself from it. Ed Norton is superb in this film and shows that he is a man who loves acting. Ed Furlong is also very good, and Avery Brooks. You see some tough race issues and how the neo-Nazis in California function. It looks at the power struggles in an American prison, and problems in American communities. There is nothing in my mind to fault this film and if you are over 16, you should watch it."

It's a bold move and it delivers one of the more eye- opening films of our time.<br/><br/>The film centers around the Vinyard family, whose eldest brother Derek (Edward Norton) is one of the most respected leaders of a southern California hate group, who has just gotten out of prison for the ruthless killing of two black men that were trying to rob him. Prison has definitely changed Derek, but his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) looks to follow in his brother's old footsteps anyway. The film spends a lot more time in the past, with black and white flashbacks showing what turned Derek into the man he became and the impact it had on his younger brother and his family.<br/><br/>This is nothing short of a powerful film. It will make you cringe, shake your head, question your beliefs, and maybe even make you cry. Norton is so convincing that when his character makes his case for hate it's scary how logical he can sound despite how the argument fundamentally lacks any sort of compassion or belief in equality. A lot of that credit should go to first time writer David McKenna whose script is absolutely fantastic, never feeling unnatural. It's hard to believe this was original material. Norton, however, deserves a lot for coming off as so convincing and making the drastic change for his character such a believable one. Furlong as the young Danny is also terrific as an impressionable young teen who is both rebellious yet loving and innocent. The supporting cast is also without flaw.<br/><br/>It may be hard for some viewers to get past some of the brutality in the film or even sit comfortably through hate speeches, tons of hate imagery, or even just take interest in characters that believe in all that, but McKenna and first-time director Tony Kaye do a tremendously sensitive job of handling the subject. No one party comes off as seeming like more of the bad guy as that is the nature of the cycle of violence. The characters are also so multi-dimensional that you can't justifiably criticize the work that's been done by everyone behind this film.<br/><br/>For those curious, the film receives its title from the name of the assignment that Danny's principle give him which asks him to analyze his brother and understand what made him who he is. Throughout the film Danny works on this paper and comes to his own stunning conclusions the same as we do. The structure is so good and so compelling and its a shame the brutal nature of the film and its subject kept it from truly getting the critical recognition it deserved."

","Before watching this I was thinking of how I thought the movie would be, my imagination didn't even give me a hint of the power this movie has. <br/><br/>In this absolute masterpiece Edward Norton plays Derek, a violent yet intelligent skin head who is led to question his beliefs and what he has based his whole life on. Edward Norton plays a very powerful neo-nazi leader, he is praised and respected by all among him. Until one night he murdered two black people who were trying to steal his car. Derek was then sentenced to three years imprisonment, throughout his time he came to realise how wrong he was and that none of his past neo-nazi racist beliefs had helped him actually do anything for him as a person. Throughout this time in the movie you genuenly feel his struggle through prison, which is shown through the intensity of Norton's acting. He then is not helped by people of of his flag and belief, but actually by a black man, the very type of person he had been hating and fighting against for his entire life, and now he owes his life to this man for helping through the most meaningful and impacting experience of his life. This really puts his life in to perspective as Derek realise how wrong he once was, he cannot grasp the fact that he fell for all of it in the first place. <br/><br/>After this miraculous change throughout his sentence in prison, he reforms as a person and then is set out to help influence his younger brother Danny, played by Danny Furlong who hadn't ever been seen in a big production like this, Furlong gives us true and meaningful performance of a younger brother trying to follow in the footsteps of his older brother's self. During this heart stoppingly powerful film we see Edward Norton master not one character but two. One of his old enraged neo-nazi self and the other of his reformed and regained self, whom had realised his mistakes in his past violent and tragic life and was trying to save not only himself but his family! Norton plays a totally believable character, going from a brutal killer to a intelligent and intellectual brother. <br/><br/>Even though this movie contains a constant theme of violence and racism, it is not trying to judge either the black or white people, it is mearly just trying to focus on the point that it's people's violent and blunt actions which cause this racial divide. This is what this film is aimed to show and does extremely well, being the most powerful, touching, and meaningful movie I have ever seen!"

I don't know what it means for Derek though. I'm wondering whether he will continue to live his life free of hate, or go back to his gang days. Who knows. One would hope that he would see that going back there isn't going to help him. But then again, I'm sure a man of his type would not allow someone to kill his brother and get away with it.<br/><br/>In short, a very good film."

","A powerful story about retribution and redemption, 'American HIstory X' is a harrowing look at a subculture that remains a very real and startling reality in the world today. It steps up to the tough questions and doesn't back down, and it's what helps set 'American History X' apart among the rest. It's an important film, a gritty film, something truly memorable that deserves to be seen, studied, and talked about.<br/><br/>Though much of the film is shot in black-and-white, 'American History X' is anything but. It doesn't preach or cater to the audience, it's a frank and honest venture that makes for an extremely difficult but worthwhile sitting. And if there's one reason and one reason only to see this film, see it for Edward Norton's provocative performance. Surely one of the braver roles ever attempted in film, and it's one of the most unforgettable. His magnetic presence exudes power, perfectly conveying the anger and blindness that surrounds him.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, 'X' does suffer from sporadic choppiness as it jumps through time to connect the dots and tell a complete, comprehensible story. More than likely, it's a result of Norton's editing overhaul that practically transformed the film from its original idea. However, director Tony Kaye's attempts to distance himself away from the project is a shame. 'American History X' may have its flaws, but it remains a challenging and thought-provoking picture whose tragedy will both terrify and shed light on important issues.<br/><br/>More reviews at rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public"

","I had put off for years seeing this film, viewing it once in awhile in bits and pieces on TV, and finally watched it in its entirety.<br/><br/>This movie should be mandatory viewing for any student in high school. I think that if students viewed this film it would change the views of a generation of racist individuals and maybe start bringing about change in this separated nation.<br/><br/>This film moved me, made me think, made me realize that we're all human beings, not black, not white, not red, not yellow...we're all from the same stock. It's not the color of the skin that makes us who we are, but the choices we make and the attitudes that we choose."

","This is a good movie. There is one glaring flaw that everyone fails to mention. This guy is the ultimate racist right? So how come he decides he is going to reform just because he gets raped by a white supremacist? What does some scummy Nazi guy raping him have anything to do with him realizing that racism is wrong? I mean really it doesn't make any sense. He is sitting there, in prison, telling his white supremacist jail friends what scumbags they are for mixing with other races (i.e. he thinks that whites shouldn't mix with any other race at all and his jail friends aren't so extreme). He doesn't respect their opinion in the first place because they aren't hardcore racists like him, so logically it makes zero sense that these people, who he doesn't respect, would have any influence on his racist beliefs. In fact, you would think it would make him more racist.<br/><br/>If you can ignore the fact that his choice to reform is based solely on him being raped then it's an awesome movie."

","On the surface, American History X is a preachy movie that tells us racism is bad. But the details of the movie undercut the preachiness and show that life is a bit more complicated than that. <br/><br/>We see why the white kids become racist against non-whites. First, their police officer Dad gets passed over for promotion in his job because he is white, and non-whites are favored over whites under the department's affirmative action policy. <br/><br/>Next, the beach town where they live is becoming integrated, and some white kids are beaten up by non-white kids. To defend themselves, they form a gang to counter the gangs of blacks and Latinos that have moved into their traditionally white neighborhood and schools. <br/><br/>Next, Derek, the neo-Nazi leader, complains about the fact that new non-white immigrants (both legal and illegal) are coming into their town, taking jobs away from unskilled whites, not assimilating into American culture, and getting government benefits not available to whites. <br/><br/>Last, there is racism directed at whites by some of the non-whites. <br/><br/>The question this movie poses is an important one: Can we be honest about the fact that what I have just talked about is going on (too many in our society deny all these things, or pretend they are not important), but still look at people as individuals and not pre-judge them on the basis of race? <br/><br/>Derek, the neo-Nazi leader, eventually meets a black inmate in prison who wins Derek over with his sense of humor. It turns out that the black is protecting Derek from other blacks and Latinos after Derek loses the protection of his neo-Nazi buddies because of a dispute between them. <br/><br/>Where the movie fails in my view (and of course, this view will be seen by many as politically incorrect) is in its transformation of Derek into someone who is now against racism simply because he made a black friend and may owe his life to that friend. <br/><br/>There is no good reason to believe that Derek's new-found ability to not pre-judge a person on the basis of that person's race means that he still doesn't believe that non-whites in general are being unfairly favored over whites in our society. <br/><br/>I myself object to the entire social discourse on race in our society today. It would be one thing if we had truly moved beyond judging people ""by the color of their skin instead of the content of their character,"" but our ""enlightened"" society today never forgets the color of people's skin. <br/><br/>The difference between now and the time when Dr. King spoke is that today our society rewards people for being a certain race at the expense of people of another race. And so we never move beyond race to looking at people as individuals and rewarding them based on their character and efforts.<br/><br/>Many argue that we need to go through this period of racial favoritism in order to level a playing field that favored whites in the past, and still favors many whites today. Perhaps. But those who make this argument must be prepared for the consequences that result when people lose out on opportunities they would otherwise enjoy. <br/><br/>The Dereks of this world are not a figment of some screen-writer's imagination. And they did not create the problem that society now asks them to solve by putting their dreams on hold. I would be more inclined to support this leveling of the playing field if everyone shared in the burden. For example, the white leaders and politicians who support racial favoritism. Why do they never step aside and offer their own jobs, positions and money to non-whites? It is ironic that, in a supposed attempt to create social justice, only middle class and poor whites are expected to make the necessary sacrifices.<br/><br/>Perhaps the makers of American History X were inclined -- somewhat -- to agree with me because the movie ends with the brutal and apparently unprovoked murder of Derek's white brother by a black. <br/><br/>The movie thus subverts its own message that everything will be just hunky-dory if the neo-Nazis just forget about their grievances over race and -- indeed -- recognize that there was no foundation for those grievances in the first place. <br/><br/>Could this ambiguity in the movie have something to do with the disagreement between the star and the director? That is the question the movie left me with. <br/><br/>Anyway, it is a superb movie in terms of acting, cinematography, and so on, and is well worth watching."

","Perhaps the highest compliment you can pay to Edward Norton is that his Oscar-nominated performance in American History X nearly convinces you that there is a shred of logic in the tenets of white supremacy. If that statement doesn't horrify you, it should; Norton is so fully immersed in his role as a new-Nazi skinhead that his character's eloquent defense of racism is disturbingly persuasive--at least on the surface. Looking lean and mean with a swastika tattoo and a mind full of hate, Derek Vinyard (Norton) has inherited racism from his father, and that learning has been intensified through his service to Cameron (Stacy Keach), a grown-up thug playing tyrant and teacher to a growing band of disenfranchised teens from Venice Beach, California, all hungry for an ideology that fuels their brooding alienation. The film's basic message--that hate is learned and can be unlearned--is expressed through Derek's kid brother, Danny (Edward Furlong), whose sibling hero-worship increases after Derek is imprisoned (or, in Danny's mind, martyred) for the killing of two black men. Lacking Derek's gift of rebel rhetoric, Danny is easily swayed into the violent, hateful lifestyle that Derek disowns during his thoughtful time in prison. Once released, Derek struggles to save his brother from a violent fate, and American History X partially suffers from a mix of intense emotions, awkward sentiment, and predictably inevitable plotting. And yet British director Tony Kaye (who would later protest against Norton's creative intervention during post-production) manages to juggle these qualities--and a compelling clash of visual styles--to considerable effect. No matter how strained their collaboration may have been, both Kaye and Norton can be proud to have created a film that addresses the issue of racism with dramatically forceful impact."
"pgear83","10","0","2","16 June 2008"," Asking the Right Questions
","A genuinely moving and inspirational experience, American History X ranks one of the best films I've ever seen. Edward Norton gives one of the great performances of all time as Derek Vinyard, a former skinhead trying to make amends and save his brother Danny (Edward Furlong) from the same path. The narrative is non-linear, alternating between the present and flashbacks to various points in the past. The flashbacks are presented in black and white, representing both the static and unchanging nature of the past and the simplistic former world-view of Derek.<br/><br/>Norton is not only great in his performance, but frightening as well. He is articulate, intelligent and sometimes for a moment, he almost seems to make sense. Unlike, say, Daniel Day Lewis in Gangs of New York, his character cannot be dismissed as a relic of history; there are people like this around today. His rhetoric embodies everything that is both dangerous and alluring about the Right, whether in the form of the Nazis of the past or the Neo-Conservatives of the present. It feeds upon the vulnerability of the ignorant, upon fear and disillusionment and the need to feel victimized. From what he says, you would think that white Americans were at the mercy of some kind of hegemony of minorities, rather than the other way around (listen to the drunk college students in 'Borat' for a disturbing real-life example of this). We are ""losing our right to pursue our destiny,"" Derek preaches before leading his gang to commit acts of terrorism and thievery. Where anyone who is not a WASP fits into this ""destiny"" is not made clear, but the words are hypnotic like Danny's Iron Cross swinging in front of his computer screen. These people hide behind false patriotism, using it as a tool for justifying the ugliest acts imaginable. The presence of the American flag is pervasive throughout the film (early on we see Danny picking his teeth with a miniature American flag, a brilliant metaphor for the above).<br/><br/>Eventually, Derek kills two blacks (perhaps the most sickening sound effect in movie history was that guy's teeth on the curb; if you've seen it you know what I'm talking about) and is sent to prison for three years. There, he meets and eventually befriends a black man who is there longer for a much lesser crime and he starts to see through his own rhetoric. He is changed both by his realization of the complex nature of the world and of the flaws in his manner of going about things. His former teacher (Avery Brooks) advises him, ""You have to ask the right questions,"" and asks ""Has anything you've done made your life better?"" Salvation will come not through rhetoric and being vindictive, but only through working to change things for the better because as Danny later says, ""Life's too short to be (expletive)ed off all the time."" <br/><br/>After Derek gets out of prison, he severs his ties with the old ""chicken-hawk"" Cameron Alexander, who had previously been his mentor and who was now courting his brother. Danny is outraged when Derek snubs his former followers and after catching up to him, noisily beats him against a metal garage-like door while Derek calmly repeats to him, ""Take it easy."" That is perhaps the main message that we take away from American History X (and one also brought into focus in Paul Haggis' Crash). People are too quick to anger and too slow to accept responsibility for themselves. In this film, as in life, the easiest answers are seldom the right ones, everything is more complicated than it seems, and there are unfortunate consequences to actions that not even the best of intentions can allay. But 'Taking it easy' is an important step in the right direction.<br/><br/>To conclude, this is another (perhaps unfortunately) timeless piece of film-making. The US is heading into what will likely be the ugliest election in its history. That ""Southern Strategy"" of race-baiting will be used, perhaps more subtly than in the past, but powerfully and more than ever. It seems that John McCain's only chance will be the rallying of men like (pre-redemption) Derek Vinyard. In any case, the soul of a nation is on the line, and we're all going to be rising up or going down with them to some degree, whether we like to admit it or not. Though those outside of the US may feel powerless in this struggle, we can at least share in a great work of art like this movie, and receive some illumination as to the nature of the issues at play."

The film is able to wrap you into the beliefs of Derek Vinyard, it builds up hate and makes you ask questions on what you believe towards race. Then in a single sentence delivered from Dr. Sweeny to Derek, ""Has anything you've done, made your life better"", wrench your mindset and throw you back to reality, and for a moment. You are Derek Vinyard. You can feel the mindset of Derek unraveling, and on the same level feel a new mindset of the character evolving. The character delvelopment is so great that by the time Danny is shot, you can't help but cry tears of grief with Derek.<br/><br/>Tony Kaye has taken the script and produced unbelievable beauty on the screen. I cannot speak for the director but my representation is that the Black and White flashback sequences represent the mindset of Derek Vinyard. You are either White, or Black. There is no color in his life, he is able to use color flashbacks for child-hood memories seeing Derek and Danny running on a beach. This represents an unpoisned mind as a child. The earliest Black and White flashback is when Dereks father first preaches to Derek about Dr. Sweeny's, ""Nigger Bullshit"".<br/><br/>Derek and Dannies performances are real. The on-screen chemistry between the brothers is someone one must see to believe. Other performances from the family members are also brilliant. A special mention to Avery Brooks (Dr. Sweeny) who's performance is portrayed by Kaye as concrete. By this I mean the character always felt solid. Always contained the presence and feeling that he was the teacher. I feel this most when he visits Derek.<br/><br/>Many people have their owns thoughts on the use of the slow-motion shots and effects. I believe they were useful for the fact they add more emphasis on the story and characters. These slow motion effects where particularly useful in the sequence where we see Derek getting out of the shower. They highlight the tattoos and beliefs which the old Derek believed.<br/><br/>I personally believe that there is no greater film ever made.

The message is legitimized by Derek's story, and the insight the movie provides into the maturity of his psyche. It's simply amazing how the movie show's how easy it is to let little thoughts of hatred you're your brain, and how those thoughts can grow into actions with the help of influential people. <br/><br/>""Is anything you've done, made your life better?"" is a powerful question that the movie asks not just Derek, but everyone watching as well. Only a film as good as American History X could pull this question off. The movie creates a character that the audience puts so much emotional baggage into, that they (or at least me) are surprised that their answer is ""no."" In a way, the movie almost makes you believe that Derek's racism is justified, and then smack's you in the face by making you realize how wrong you are. <br/><br/>On top of the incredible story, the movie is technically superb.

The whole time I was amazed and transfixed by the acting and writing, but it never really shocked me in the way I expected to be. In my opinion, this is the only factor in keeping it from being a perfect film and one of the best of the 1990s. As mentioned before, Edward Norton proves he is arguably the best actor of this generation with a phenomenal performance that makes him so evil in black and white, as well as being able to sympathize for him in color.

Edward Norton did a great job playing Derek Vinyard, a neo-nazi skinhead preventing his brother going down the wrong path he did. The acting is just perfect when characters express their emotions through rage, humor and depression. Many people say the message of this film is that racism is bad, but there is more to it. The message being (from my point of view) is that many of us are role models for other people or some us have role models and it's the role models' responsibility to be a good one.

Only a few very good dialogs are there and that too in the end of the movie Cinematography is also not remarkable...<br/><br/>Sound editing is good and there is not much scope for costumes and sets...<br/><br/>Watch this movie if you wanna see a good story and acting...."
"FeistyCadavr","10","0","3","11 December 2007"," Thoughts on American History X
","The movie was written by McKenna (presumably Gentile), and put out by New Line (Jewish owned). It would have been interesting to be a fly on the wall at the production meetings as they tried to balance the need to make an interesting movie (letting a Nazi make his case) against the need for Semitical Correctness.... I truly wonder where the writer's opinions lie. The indications are that he has a good deal more sympathy for the skins' case than the Jews' because the former is strongly drawn, while the latter is barely sketched.<br/><br/>The guts of the movie are the speeches by Derek. Of these speeches, the best is his dinner-table destruction of the Jewish cant put out by the Elliot Gould character courting his mother in which he demolishes the Jew's inevitable excuse explanations of poverty and racism for Rodney King and the L.A. riots. Edward Norton is a fine actor, and is quite persuasive as a strong and principled skinhead. He is much less plausible as a post-prison reformed soul, but that is a script problem. We are supposed to believe that the principles he stated and defended at the risk of his life have been changed because he encountered a funny Black man and some corrupt White racists in prison. This failure of characterization was probably made necessary by the dictates of Semitical Correctness at New Line. I'm sure McKenna realizes that Derek would be nothing but entrenched in his beliefs by a stint in prison.<br/><br/>In fact, at no point are the racist beliefs of the main characters Derek and younger brother Daniel challenged. By challenged, I mean shown to be logically or evidentially impaired. Instead, they are attacked modern-style, by fem-think. We see kicked-to-the-curb Gould saying ""I'm sorry"" to Derek's mother, his tragic gaze suggesting his horror at a son so far gone. Perhaps the Jews at New Line think fifty years of maceration in their agitprop have the rest of us accepting their ""perfect and persecuted"" self-portrait. Perhaps they really do think that raised eyebrows, shaken heads and baleful stares and speech codes and prison sentences are strictest refutation. Hell, simple coherence -- let alone logic -- seems too much to ask of Hollywood these days.<br/><br/>Gould was perfect casting. At once patronizing and effeminate, he is the precise foil to Norton's master-of-my-own-house masculinity. It's not just that a poorly educated skin makes mincemeat of him in argument, but that his Jewish dogma is so ugly. In Norton's combative integrity we see the Old America, made up of free and responsible White men. In Gould we see the coming World Slave State, where the thinking is done for us, and it remains only to Accept.<br/><br/>The part that bodes thinking on is that this movie is about an inch from being quaint. As in, Oh, how cute, that little white mouse is crouching in the corner, baring its teeth in self-defense!, as our ugly Jewish hand reaches in to pick it up to feed it to the snake. Isn't that precious. Such stirring words and sculpted pecs! What a man he might have been two hundred years ago! But thanks to TV, we are all Jews now...."

","Having always been a little scared of American History X, what with the shower parts and all, I finally decided to rent it and watch it. Now I realize what an amazing film this really is. The Script- First off, the script is just amazing, it'll choke you up or make you laugh a bit (see Edward Furlong's take on getting expelled). The language is a bit rough but it adds to what we have to imagine is their regular way of life. The Actors- Best acting I've seen in awhile, I had my doubts about Edward Furlong but he pulled it off perfectly and Edward Norton pleases as usual. Direction/Camera work- The direction is great but with camera I have one complaint at some spots it was too close but other than that brilliant. Also, the end will reduce many people to tears. All in all, great film, highly recommended, 10/10<br/><br/>-Hannah S."
"lagriff05","8","0","1","8 December 2007"," Overrated and incomplete
","Well, this is a bit of a letdown, but then again, I went into it with a critical mind anyway, so it's not such a surprise. This is the much lauded American History X, and it is in fact a great movie, and I do mean truly *great*, instead of just *good* or whatever other adjective you might stick in there. What is ""great,"" then? American History X boasts a sleek, crystal clear filming job and top-notch, through the roof acting, and it's obvious that this one wasn't let out of the gate until everything was just picture perfect all around. Yet, at the same time, this is not always good, with a few blemishes adorning its polished-to-perfection exterior. Yes, this is surely a giant of a film, but it does tend to stumble over its own feet a bit. Just a bit.<br/><br/>Not modest or afraid at all, American History X is chock full of lengthly, rather rotund exhibits of preaching - and it is even mentioned once in the film - which is not a bad thing in itself. I hear lots of people crowing about how that's what's wrong with this movie, but no, it isn't. I don't mind it at all, and it mostly just serves as food for thought and a way of carrying the story along. But yes, there it is - this preaching, as it is so dubbed, carries the story far too much, overwhelming the movie like a blanket. The problem with this movie is that it's incomplete. Come on, are we really supposed to believe that all of this - the party, the talk, the flashbacks, the death - happened in one night? Are we honestly expected to believe that this white supremacist teenager changed his outlook in life in one single night while writing an essay? The ending, too...while touching, it left me feeling cold overall. Nothing here was elaborated upon properly - we didn't see near enough of Derek's transformation to a new man in prison; just the bare minimum of it. There were less than 3 scenes with this Cameron character, who had been built up as quite important, and the whole party speeds by like a blur to the point where you wonder what just hit you. Give us more, dammit, this barely scrapes the surface of the potential this movie had. It tries to fool us by throwing in a lot of preaching and whatnot, but that won't fool me.<br/><br/>Regardless, I did enjoy this quite a bit. American History X grabbed me by the throat and went full-throttle for damn near two hours. The characters are believable, and the plot is thick and quite juicy. It's a thoughtful, pensive film that will force you to really sink your teeth in and think; this isn't a summer blockbuster or a popcorn flick of any kind. For fans of intelligent, creative, introspective films, this is a winner, but be warned, it is not as good as people say. A rather tragic complex; a great film that just doesn't live up to expectations. The potential is there, though, and all in all this is an enjoyable film, so go get it if this sounds like your thing."

"kylekool150","9","0","1","26 October 2007"," An observant, realized Crime-Drama about hate and change
","American History X is a movie that details a graphic portrayal of a former Neo-Nazi, Derek Vinyard, who is sent to prison for 3 years for 2 murders. After experiencing certain unimaginable horrors of prison, he realizes he has to steer his younger brother, Daniel, from going down the wrong path. The events that follow what I have told you, are shocking, controversial, but not meant to direct any hate the characters express in this film, yet I don't think anybody who sees such shocking scenes as the Supermarket Riot, Prison Rape or even the ending, would want to have any affiliation with the horrible things portrayed in this movie.<br/><br/>This film, and it's characters, are very realized. Edward Norton plays a convincing role as Derek, in which he earned an Oscar Nod. The Director, Tony Kaye, makes the film stylized and different by using color as recent events, and B&W as past events. A little touch that art-house film fans will probably enjoy. This film might be pretty compelling to some, but for those who understand the well intended morality of it all, will be thrilled.<br/><br/>Films as recommendable as this, don't come along too often, but this film proves that independent films are still around today, and are just as enjoyable as other great dramas such as ""Pulp Fiction"", ""The Usual Suspects"" and more. With that said, this film is definitely one of the best films of the 90's, and without giving away anything too interesting in the film, I will end my review.<br/><br/>3/4 Stars"

","This film deals with many problems that have occurred in American History concerning bigotry of all races and how people have dealt with this problem in their own homes and how prison life also separates many races and causes all kinds of problems in those institutions. Edward Norton,(Derek Vinyard) played the role as a skin head Neo-Nazi who took the law into his own hands and killed two African American men who attempted to steal his truck. Edward Furlong,(Danny Vinyard) was a younger brother who loved his brother and followed in his footsteps of hatred. Elliott Gould, (Murray) was a teacher at one of the high schools in this small town and was courting Beverly D'Angelo), Doris Vinyard when Derek got into a fight with him because he was Jewish and showed great hatred towards all Jews, which broke up his mother's relationship with Murray. This film shows clearly how hatred creates problems that this country does not need or any country and it all starts in the home, where bigotry has the early stages of breeding in men and women's hearts and souls.

","This film is a great study of race relations, without resorting to the usual ""polically correct "" diatribe's.<br/><br/>Edwards Norton (Derek in the film) makes one of his greatest performances as the son of a fireman who was killed by blacks while reporting to a fire. The trauma that his sons experience leads Derek (Edward Norton) into the path of the white supremasive movement. He becomes a skinhead who rallies other disaffected whites into a movement that rejects not only blacks but also Asians, and those of Spanish heritage. He becomes a hero to the white supremacists and organizes attacks against those he blames for his father's death.<br/><br/>He winds up in prison for the death of several blacks who tried to either steal of damage his car. Whether those black were stealing or vandalizing car remains vague in the story line. Never-the-less he ends up in prison for three years where he learns first hand the hypocrisy of race relations. He befriends a black inmate who was mistreated by the criminal justice system, and soon reject his affiliation with the white/Aryans crowd.<br/><br/>A commentary on this film cannot be complete without mentioning DR. Sweeney. A black professor who encourages his students to write an essay about issues of civil rights. Derek's brother writes about Mein Kampf. At about the same time Norton gets released from prison and goes about rejecting his path of hate.<br/><br/>This is one of the best film I've watched. I highly recommend viewing this film.

He gets 3 years in jail. When he comes out he finds his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) walk on the same path as he had walked. Derek attempts to persuade Danny not to be like him but follow the path of life that is without hate. In between the movie deals with flashback on the transformation of Derek in the prison.<br/><br/>The movie attempt is strong. The Director Tony Kate must have taken lots of guts to make this movie on racism and hate. It is not amazing to know that in its titles he did not want his name to be mentioned  (instead he preferred Hummpy Dummpy) just of the fear of being targeted by both black and white groups.<br/><br/>The movie is bold, touches the most relevant subject of hatred between different people. But half way through the movie I felt that it has become too preachy. I also had this notion that Jews must have produced it. I do not know whether it is true  but there was one silly dialogue in the movie that will remain in my memory  You look good, you look like a Jew. That itself was racist and discriminating and negative conditioning.<br/><br/>That apart, Edward Norton played the role really well. He was fortunate to get good roles in his career  Fight Club and then this. Now a day he has lost his ability, rawness and spontaneity.<br/><br/>This movie can also become so relevant in today's India where the fanatic Brahmins wants to teach hatred to their children for lower castes, untouchables, minorities etc.<br/><br/>Technically the movie is brilliant. It uses good black and white flashbacks and color current events. The camera work, the prison shots etc. are very authentic. The beginning sex scene was a bit overdone and totally unnecessary in the event of things in this movie.<br/><br/>Sadly the movie starts with black committing a crime and getting killed by a racist white, and ends with racist black killing a white person.<br/><br/>Anyways, a good representation and attempt!

","Edward Norton is one of my favorite actors, and he does a fantastic job as usual. This is definitely one if his most intense roles ever. And Edward Furlong, of course, is a fine young actor who pulls the right heart strings in this. The film is about a former skinhead leader who gets out of jail and sets his sights on diverting the influence of the gangs from his younger brother. He wants to tell him his story and tell him why he quit being one. Will he succeed? The film packs a punch and has some terrifying sequences. It wasn't a perfect film. It lacks the gritty realism that worked so well in ROMPER STOMPER, it lacks the subtlety that made A CLOCKWORK ORANGE so terrifying, and it lacks the style that gave personality to TRAINSPOTTING. It definitely had a real human side to it, and it certainly shows when it's prevalent. I recommend American HISTORY X because it's a good film. Don't expect to enjoy it though."

The use of black and white cinematography to portray painful flashbacks is amazing, a scene that hasn't yet left my mind, is when Derek (Norton), being handcuffed in slow motion, connects eyes with his younger brother Danny (Furlong). That one glare tells the story of their intense relationship. In fact, that one scene is the screenplay of ""American History X"" in a glance. Artfully done.<br/><br/>In a role where he had to gain thirty pounds of muscle, Edward Norton undoubtedly delivers the best performance of his career as the intimidating and yet uncomfortably human Derek Vinyard. Edward Furlong is also solid as the young and very confused Danny.<br/><br/>""American History X"" is one of the most powerful movies ever released. Since ""Schindler's List"", I believe the subject of racism hasn't been tackled so masterfully.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, despite the fact that ""American History X"" is one of the best films in years, it is quite underrated, only being nominated for one Academy Award.

","I'm not quite sure which planet the last reviewer lives on, but to suggest that racism doesn't exist purely because of the colour of a person's skin is being either naive or in denial. This film portrays just how one-dimensional racists and white supremacists really are. The main character's views, played by Edward Norton, on white supremacy are second hand, as are his young brother's (played by Edward Furlong). Their conversion to racism is dramatic, almost akin to the conversion on the way to Damascus, and yet highly plausible. Their deliverance is again dramatic, and this can possibly be because their racist convictions were not necessarily genuine, or deeply held. I'm not quite sure why the last reviewer thought that class and other weightier topics were ignored, I believe they're present, but not rammed down your throat, after all, this is a movie about the dark side of humanity that comes clothed in racism,and racism in both directions. It isn't attempting to explore issues of poverty, mental illness etc. as I said, other issues do feature, you only have to be observant. <br/><br/>This film, unfortunately, is as relevant today as it was when it was first made almost ten years ago.People are still dying on our streets (and corner shops) because of the colour of their skin, or their ethnic origin. The parts, in the main, are well played, although had they lengthened the film by another 10 -15 minutes, then they could have explored, a bit more, the characters of the mother and sister.Elliot Gould's character, unfortunately, fails to develop, and Avery Brooks does come across as a bit of a stereotypical crusader. On the whole, a movie well worth watching. not thought provoking, rather a pretty good mirror on the worst elements of society."

Once seen, you will lean one way or the other, but my guess is that you'll lean towards influence. In my opinion, this film discusses race issues we still deal with today from a fresh perspective of a higher class of white supremacy, and does a spectacular job of offering life lessons without preaching about normal diversity and race related issues we often hear today in our schools, businesses, and media. Regardless of what people say, especially on this website, this film is a must see."

","American History X is a brutal and moving portrayal of racism in late-20th century America. At first, it seems balanced and intelligent, which makes it all the more tragic. This leads a viewer to feel uncomfortable--on the surface, it seems to bring out questions of one's own views on racism, but on repeated viewings, I figured out why it left a bad taste in my mouth. <br/><br/>First the good: American History X is beautifully shot, with a grace that few movies achieve. Tony Kaye's background as a director and cinematographer is in music videos, but instead of quick edits and jarring effects to build tension, he uses light and textures, and often slows moments of impact so that even the most brutal scenes become a sort of ballet of forms. <br/><br/>In addition to powerful performances by the film's leads, Edward Norton and Edward Furlong, who are two of the best actors of the 1990s, the supporting cast brings depth and subtlety to even the smallest roles. Standouts include Stacy Keach as a White Supremacist leader, Beverly D'Angelo as a frustrated but loving single mother, and my favourite of the group, Elliott Gould as a Jewish high school history teacher, who acts as a catalyst for a couple of small, important moments in the action. Gould's performance is completely heartbreaking during one scene, where he says nothing for several minutes, but the sadness on his face says everything: ""Where did everyone go wrong?"" <br/><br/>This is the important question, and the film works hard to show the White Supremacists as a group of frustrated, angry kids who have been led to this point through the leader's exploitation. In fact, they're realistic enough that they reminded me of several of the guys I knew in high school, who were, like Derek Vinyard, so smart and informed about politics that you wondered what they could achieve if they used their powers for good. Through the narrative, we see Vinyard transform from an angry kid with something to prove into a complicated adult, who learns lessons about compassion and consequence, and tries to show them to his brother Daniel.<br/><br/>****SPOILERS BELOW***<br/><br/>Unfortunately, they should have left it at that. The film fails for two reasons. The first is that the death of a major character at the end of the film, for no good reason, to me says that the writer didn't know how to end the story, and I consider this a weakness. The movie seems to be saying that violence begets violence, however, violence is usually the end result of a set of circumstances. While the film tries hard to achieve a balance that shows all the characters, white and non-white, as being well rounded, with both positive and negative qualities, I think it fails most of its Young Black Male characters. <br/><br/>The second reason the film fails is that by having Danny die as the result of race-related gang violence, the message of the movie underscores what the ""bad"" White Supremacists have been saying all along: Blacks are the scourge of the community the White gangs are trying to protect, and violence is a way of life for ""those people."" That's the true tragedy. It's bad enough that gangs ARE a source of identity and culture, and that so many young men live such a violent existence, but American History X perpetuates the same tired stereotypes. Will Hollywood ever break free of this? Somehow I doubt it--if nothing else, it sells. <br/><br/>Whatever your views on racism, whatever side of that line you're on, American History X is still a gripping movie, despite its flaws. It will stay with you for a long, long time."

While both were great in their own way, Remember the Titans is essentially a feel good movie which gives you that warm feeling at the end. This however is a movie which shows the shocking consequences that race wars can have. And brilliantly portrayed as well.<br/><br/>Edward Norton plays a neo-Nazi character who organizes meetings for the D.O.A, a neo-Nazi kind of outfit. Frustrated at everyone, following his dad;s death in an accident, which he blames on the system of granting privileges to other races, he ends up in jail for murdering two black youths. The story traces his redemption in prison and how he tries to prevent his younger brother(Eddie Furlong) from going down the same path as he did.<br/><br/>Edward Norton is brilliant as Derek Vinyard. He conveys the characters hatred for other races with such shocking reality. Only a fine actor as himself can pull off such a complex protagonist. Eddie Furlong is pretty okay as the younger brother, but Norton is definitely the star of the show. Another imposing presence is Avery Brooks, who plays the local high school principal, Dr. Sweeny Todd.

","This movie was and still is an absolute masterpiece, highlighting several issues still prominent in modern society. Edward Norton plays his role fantastically and brings life to his character, although this itself is somewhat spine chilling. The racial vilification which is shown in this movie is still relevant to todays society, although it may not be quite as brutal as shown. The violence, while some may consider it to be grotesque and disturbing is in context and as such cannot be considered to take away from the movie, just as it is in Stanley Kubrick's 'A Clockwork Orange'.<br/><br/>Edward Furlong's performance completes a movie that will no doubt never be lost to the ages, while Ethan Suplee gives comic relief and still adds to the depth of the story with the portrayal of his character.<br/><br/>While there is indeed a indeed an amount of violence in this film, it can only be considered to be in context and appropriate to the story. This film is a masterpiece, full of feeling and brutality that still occurs in places both in America. It can only be considered to be one of the all time great films, to write it off as mindless, violent rubbish is absolute sacrelidge. 10/10"

","A former Neo-Nazi Derek (Edward Norton) comes out of prison, determined to put his past life behind him and be there for his family especially for his brother Danny (Edward Furlong) who is following in his footsteps. His past life is told in black and white flashbacks throughout the movie so we get to see the type of person he was before he went into prison. What is ironic about the film is Derek got his brother interested in the neo-Nazi cause and it is up to him now to show his brother there is more to life then mindless hatred.<br/><br/>There is a lot of complaints about the acting and the subject matter but I think those people ain't seeing what the film is trying to say.<br/><br/>It is a very dark film that doesn't flinch away from the subject matter, the violence is hard to watch at times especially when Derek is raped by his fellow skinheads. What is disturbing most about the film is Derek and Danny are very clever but their minds are getting twisted by hatred that has no direction.<br/><br/>I think the acting is not bad. Edward Norton is just mesmerising in the dual roles he has to play in this film. The first being a skinhead, you can see the madness from within him being translated to his eyes. Then as the changed man, his devastation when he see's his dead brother, has me in tears every time. <br/><br/>Edward Furlong isn't bad either, although at times, he does come across as wooden. Stacy Keach plays a charismatic leader of the skinheads who twists their minds, even though he doesn't belief half the things he says to them and keeps his own agenda hidden from them so he can keep his control over them. He is also seen as a coward who is quite happy to incite all this hatred but not to take part in it. Avery Brooks who played Captain Sisko in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, plays a professor who sees past the brothers idiotic hatred and wants to turn their focus to something positive.<br/><br/>If I have one negative thing to say, it is that I would have liked the film to show what happened to Edward Norton's character after his brother died, whether he went back to his old ways or continued on the more positive path and try to turn the skinheads away from the violence and hatred they embraced.<br/><br/>This film just had me from start to finish."

","This film is brilliant, pure class. It shows directly the consequences of being a white supremacist. It managed to get a true portrayal of Skinheads in America, people say that the shower scene wasn't needed, it is one of the most effective scenes in there and it's the major turning point of the film. The last scene of the film though is one of the single most effective pieces of cinema in recent years, it doesn't pussy out and let him live because he's changed his ways, it kills him for his past convictions. Now i rate this film highly up there with my favourite (taxi Driver, One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest, The Departed and Trainspotting). I'm not trying to say go out and see it but if you get a chance watch it. Not for the squeamish or the immature.

"paul2001sw-1","7","0","1","12 June 2007"," Watchable, but heavy-handed
","There's a strong performance from Edward Norton in 'American History X', a film about racial tensions; but also some heavy-handedness. The personal development of the characters is depicted in a rather deterministic fashion; Norton's Nazi is far more eloquent than any real-life fascist, while Avery Brooks' teacher is blessed (in a clichéd and patronising gift so often granted to black characters) with unsurmountable gravitas. The direction is also rather obvious, with solemn voice-overs, an over-the-top score, and the needless use of black-and-white photography to differentiate the recent past from the present. While the underlying squalor, and drug abuse, that promotes gang violence, is hardly shown at all. Norton makes it watchable; but it's all rather obvious."

","American History X has gone down as one of the most brilliants works of art in the past twenty years. Focusing on the subject of racism and Neo-Nazism within the United States along with the questions of affirmative action and illegal immigration. The film holds nothing back. I have never seen a film so balanced. What I mean by balanced is how the dialog, the story, the acting, and the characters are all amazing and brilliant equally. It is one of the most powerful films I have ever seen on the subject of racism.<br/><br/>Derek is one of the most feared Neo-Nazi leaders in Los Angeles. He holds nothing back when expressing his beliefs. If he needs to kill, if he needs to destroy, if he needs to harm, he'll do it just to see what according to him is right is accomplished. But after a brutal three year stint in prison for the murder of two black men, Derek's only fear is that his brother will follow down the same path as he once did. Ed Norton stars as Derek in a film of redemption and acceptance of one another.<br/><br/>Ed Norton is one of the best actors around. He held nothing back for American History X. He became the crazed, racist, mislead Derek that we see in the film. His performance is one of the most memorable performances by an actor in the past 25 years. The ending scene will bring tears to your eyes as Derek's ultimate horror finally comes about in startling fashion. When someone says ""Norton was the key to this films success"" they are right.<br/><br/>Edward Furlong is strong as Derek's younger brother. He makes you believe that Danny is being influenced by his brother. He makes his character to be innocent yet dangerous. We see the true human side of people through him and his misguided beliefs. We come to understand him and the dark side of Neo-Nazism through Furlong's character. The chemistry between Furlong and Norton is very strong and very believable though not nearly as memorable as Norton's.<br/><br/>The film is seriously intense. Language is flying at every corner. There isn't any drug use which seems to be common in every gang movie today. I liked this because drugs seem to always be the focal point when it comes to gang films. Instead of focusing on drugs and things, the film focuses on the beliefs of the Neo-Nazi's and how in trying to strengthen society, they have all but divided it more. They have just brought more violence with their beliefs and the film stands as stark opposition to anyone who is racist or discriminative.<br/><br/>Tony Kaye disowned the film after it was released. I still don't know why. The film is brilliant and mostly because of him and the work he did on it. The dialog, the characters, the story is all memorable in my book. I have trouble finding a better lead actor then Edward Norton. I have trouble finding a more complex character then Derek Vinyard, and I have trouble finding a more believable and brutal story the American History X. It is by far one of the best films of the 90's.<br/><br/>5/5 Stars"

","I took the liberty of watching this movie out of boredom and curiosity last week. Although I had heard about it, I knew little more than the premise of the movie and expected a clichéd story of reform and self-discovery. This movie is...incredible. The acting is superb, with Edward Norton's performance as the despicable, yet highly intelligent and convincing Derek Vinyard who ultimately undergoes a transformation that is so realistically and emotionally portrayed. Other cast members such as Edward Furlong gave great performances as well. This is one of those movies that really gets inside of your skin and stirs you up with emotion, as you are presented with two sides of the battle between racism and acceptance in all its gory detail, with heated debate and physical violence that captures the spirit of this film. Not much more I can say but to recommend it to all viewers mature enough to handle it (the R rating was given for a very good reason)."

","One thing about gangster movie is that the main character is always the bad guy. But yet we always feel sorry for them. Remember Scarface? Anyway American History X tells a story about a skinhead, Derek, who was asked to start a gang who are against people with different skin color. So they go and trash a supermarket own by an Asian. One night, tow African American decided to steal Derek's car because of some problems with each other. His brother, Danny, saw it and told Derek and Derek came out with a gun and killed them. Derek was caught, went to prison and then Danny decided to follow Derek's footsteps. When Derek came out of prison, he acts differently and he wants to stop the madness. And to protect his Family especially Danny.<br/><br/>It's good to watch a gangster film where the gangster is trying to change for the better. It has a powerful story. It tells us to respect everyone no matter what color or races they are and to be careful of who we be-friend with.<br/><br/>Chamera angle screenplay is good. The ""past"" scene also plays a good part in the film. Edward Norton did a great job bringing Derek to life. The music score fits perfectly with every scenes. It's an almost perfect film.

","American History X is a literal ""punch in the stomach"" against racism and in-tolerances. I saw it twice to ""correct"" the impressions I had the first time I watched it, but still make me consider this movie good but not convincing.<br/><br/>The perfect script makes the dialogs fluid and entertaining, but also rich in the contents. Political debates seem real, as the director would deliver to us the ""gross weight"" of the words, confiding we'd make the right ""tare"" with our conscience. The boy Danny had a role I loved. He's probably the best actor in the movie, showing a teen-ager under the influences of a brother and mother with opposite minds, but (thanks to his age) both equally beloved, beyond political visions.<br/><br/>Derek's redemption is badly portrayed. There is not a single reason because he should change his life INSIDE the fascist club, unchaining brawls and wounding the boss. The ""conversion"" of his brother on the stands is too quick and widely unrealistic. Also, performances by Brooks and Suplee are really really bad.<br/><br/>The 2 hours go away rapidly when you like meaningful stories, but the shocking ending doesn't get a gram of relief. Probably it's a movie crafted for an American audience and something was lost in translation. Anyway, a minute after you've entirely watched it, an earthquake of thoughts invades your mind, with a unusual yearning to share and measure your own points of view with the others'. That's the best quality of American History X, inviting to take courage and sides on an argument, immigration and tolerance, concerning every single First World nation.<br/><br/>Vote: 23/30"

","I am always surprised when such a compelling film stays under the radar screen, as American History X did. Yes, it was hard to watch because it was brutally honest about the issue of gangs, violence and racism, but it wasn't a sensational film where violence was added for the sake of violence.<br/><br/>This film was groundbreaking and should be recommended -- possibly mandatory viewing for gangs and incarcerated gang kids.<br/><br/>We can see by the new resurgence in gang violence that this problem is only escalating. The movie showed how an impressionable young man, Edward Norton, ended up seeking the gang life after losing the primary male role model in his life, his father. The gang leader of this Neo Nazi group replaced his father and instilled hate in him.<br/><br/>Gangs give kids without personal power and belongingness a sense of both, and American History X showed how tragic the outcome of belonging to these gangs truly is.<br/><br/>I love the fact that Norton has never shied away from roles that are controversial and complex; resulting in movies all Americans need to see.

The color scenes are just as breathtaking.<br/><br/>The direction tells the story very smoothly, we don't find out what Edward Norton character entirely did to get in prison until about forty five minutes into the movie and when you do you have to decide if he can ever be forgiven. The scene in the party, the costumes, the posters, the way you know people who live this way.<br/><br/>I know everybody says this but it's true. Edward Norton IS the man of the hour in this film. Five minutes into his character, Derek Vineyard I said, ""Wait, THATS Edward Norton!"" The small mentally handicapped kid from Primal Fear, the weak looking narrator from Fight Club. Now he looks like a guy if you saw him walking towards you, you would want to walk on the sidewalk on the other side of the street. He gained 30 pounds of muscle for this role and actually looks like a militaristic skin head. Oh yeah, his acting, he never misses a beat, he sounds like he means everything he says and then some. Watching this movie a dumb person might assume he really is the role he plays. Edward Norton is the Marlon Brando of our day. The role itself is well written, but being the character, I'd say less than five percent of Hollywood would have agreed to the role.<br/><br/>The writing is quite something. The story feels real and I've heard it was. The only people who hate the dialogue are people who just can't listen to it. The dinner scene had amazing conversations and is actually one of the best scenes of the movie. People say it's the violence that gets to them, I think it's the nature of the writing that makes them uncomfortable, it even makes myself uncomfortable during my first watch. The character Derek Vinyard isn't a simple one, he isn't the ignorant redneck racist we're all used to. He's intelligent capable and has what it takes to be a leader.<br/><br/>Even though you've seen racism movies before, it's a mistake too pass this one up. It has plenty to offer, plenty of things you haven't seen or heard before. In the end it's worth it and you are glad you saw it."

"DunkinDan89","10","0","1","6 January 2007"," Norton's Pitch-Perfect Performance Makes 'X' a Must-See
","There's a scene in ""American History X"" in which Derek Vinyard glances back at his younger brother, Danny, who's staring at the heinous crime his older brother has just committed. Derek's face alternates between pride and joy, all the way down to horror and shock in only a few moments time. This is the scene that basically identifies what the film truly is, a movie about a lot of prideful people about something truly horrifying and frightening.<br/><br/>Racism.<br/><br/>The story centralizes in on two very messed up and brainwashed characters, that being Derek (Edward Norton) and Danny (played by another Edward, Edward Furlong). Both are victims of the cleverly seducing Cameron Alexander (Stacy Keach), a white supremacist who targets young, socially insecure Caucasian males to join a group in which Hitler is exalted and ""justice"" is encouraged among the lower classes of society.<br/><br/>Derek joins the group out of hate for what has happened to his family, that being the murder of his father by men of a different race. He is a brilliant student, as seen by the high regard teacher Bob Sweeney (Avery Brooks) holds for him, but that all changes in a few short years. Derek becomes a god among men, commanding complete respect by others in the group, as well as the respect of his extremely troubled family, even if he may fly off the handle more than an average person would. The multi-dimensional Derek eventually winds up in prison for that crime his younger brother witnessed. At a point in the film, it is revealed to us that if his brother would have testified, Derek would have gotten life. After serving his time however, he is a completely changed man, someone whose life goal seems set upon helping his younger brother swerve away from the path he is on, the same path Derek treaded upon when he was his age.<br/><br/>The skill and creativity of the movie is seen early on. The film changes back and forth between the current events going on in Derek and Danny's life as well as flashbacks of what both went through when they were juveniles. Director Tony Kaye uses a black and white scope during the flashback scenes, while colorizing the ""now"" part of their lives, something I have never seen done before.<br/><br/>All in all, I admire this film. Its a preachy movie, but its on a topic that is still very much at large in our society nowadays. Norton delivers one of the best performances I have ever watched, seeing as its not very easy to go from a neo-Nazi skinhead to a family man all in two hours time, but he does it successfully. Norton makes the viewer believe that he is not Edward Norton, but the sick and twisted Derek Vinyard. The language and content of the movie are both very rough, dealing with uncomfortable prison scenes as well as extremely vivid turmoil among the Vinyard family. Norton and Furlong are incredible as the two brothers, and a strong supporting cast in Brooks, Keach, and Beverly D'Angelo make the film a gem.<br/><br/>Its not often that a movie comes along and completely changes the opinion on how I view the world and racism in general, but I can say ""American History X"" certainly accomplished this in captivating fashion."

They've been waiting for the return of their hero.<br/><br/>Derek has other plans, though. Three years and one prison rape gave Derek enough time and reason to rethink everything he once believed to be true. With the help of his former high school teacher turned mentor, Derek now fully understands the emptiness of his former beliefs. Derek simply wants a second chance at life, but it won't be that easy. Danny worships Derek and is stunned at his change in attitude. Not only will Derek have to remove himself from the life he once lead, he will now also have to remove his brother Danny. A task that proves to be much more difficult than it sounds.<br/><br/>Any movie covering the topic of racism is typically difficult to digest, especially when its portrayal is as honest as American History X. As the viewer we get to see it all from the brutal hate crime that landed Derek in jail to the irrational beliefs that fueled his rage. It's not an easy movie to sit through, but well worth it.<br/><br/>I have often felt that American History X could be used in high school to educate students about racism. It would take an incredibly talented instructor to tackle the subject using this movie as a tool because many people that harbor racist beliefs depicted in X may view Derek as a hero for all the wrong reasons. I say this because I have personally talked to people who ""like"" this movie for all the wrong reasons.<br/><br/>X does an excellent job of portraying the pent up anger and frustration of white middle class males that typically leads to these sort of beliefs. Even better, X shows that racism usually starts in the home. Derek adopted his beliefs from his father and were, in his mind, only justified when his father (a fireman) was killed in an all black neighborhood while attempting to do his job.<br/><br/>X brings up many social arguments including border control laws and the demographics of prison populations. The movie doesn't attempt to address those issues from a solution standpoint, rather it suggests that if we continue to use examples of societies problems such as these to justify our hate and unhappiness than we are only that much further from becoming happy.<br/><br/>The movie is an honest look at an ugly part of our society. I think the movie does a superb job of portraying the story and issues without preaching to the viewer. That being said, it's impossible for an educated viewer not to see the flaws in the views that lead to Derek's hate crime.<br/><br/>I'd recommend this movie to anyone and everyone with the caveat that at times it can be uncomfortable to watch. I'd also add that if you are a fan of Edward Norton his performance was Oscar worthy."

","I consider American History X to be an extraordinarily good film. It is a social education in itself and an object lesson in human relations gone wrong. The script is so real that you are actually there. All of the acting is so good that one tends to believe the actors' value system are reflected in their lines, although this could not be so because if they believed what they are saying they could not cooperate with each other. All of this is paced and timed by marvelously direction.<br/><br/>Although the theme and script are specifically American they portray and expound a kind of problem which is perhaps the most universal human failing, i.e. suspicion and fear of difference and of otherness. Also a fearful adherence to the pseudo-safety of the status quo no matter what the expense to the other.

","This film is not for the week of heart, the superficial, or the children. There are scenes within which are brutal, repulsive, and vile. Yet, they need to be.

A school principal fights against the hatred. Avery Brooks, while rarely on screen commands the drama and bends in to his iron-clad will.<br/><br/>The result is a film dark as midnight and as effective as a hired killer.

","American History X is not for the faint of heart. The film has questionable scenes and dialog however, a very mentionable theme that leaves the viewer with many personal questions, ideas and thoughts of racial inequality and prejudice. The movie leaves the viewer with an astounding ending and truly touches each viewer so as to keep them thinking; thinking of racial conflicts in the movie and in their own lives. The movie is directed wonderfully so as not to confuse the viewer when the main character's little brother, Danny, recollects past events in his family's life. The scenes that are of the past are depicted in black and white, unlike the colored scenes of the present. The acting performed by Edward Norton and Edward Furlong is exceptional; very dramatic and emotional. The movie contains the wonderful element of irony more than once. The overall theme stays with the viewer and is just inspiring; inspiring to do for all races because we are all people. The movie's music, dialog and ""eventful"" scenes all contribute to the mood of the movie very well. You, as the viewer, can truly feel the hatred the actors feel towards other races; you might even feel disgust on the basis of their thoughts and preemptive actions. The movie questions your own thoughts and actions towards others. The film is about how we, as individuals, choose to live. I recommend this film to young teens and adults all around. It is a very dramatic and inspiring film full of amazing tone, mood and irony. The movie will touch all in some way and stick with you while you keep thinking of racial issues discussed in the movie."

","Led by two of the strongest performances around, 1998's 'American History X' is one of the films you need to watch in your life. Edward Norton plays Derek Vinyard, a neo-nazi skinhead who, after a life changing stint in jail, tries to prevent his brother (Edward Furlong) from taking the same path. The film is brilliantly directed by Tony Kaye, as he catches every emotion that Ed Norton conveys in his performance. Kaye captures the mood and emotion very well here. He makes a lot out of this film, and it remains one of my favorites. Ed Norton's performance is simply brilliant in every sense of the word. He captures the essence of evil, while at the same time providing a likable character. He plays the strong Vinyard to perfection. Ed Furlong's performance is excellent for what he's given. He's given the brooding and potentially one dimensional character, and turns it into a deep, confused, and potentially volatile young man that is easily influenced. American History X remains one of my favorite movies because it displays how racism can effect an entire family. I cannot stress how good and moving this film is, and this is possible because of Norton, Furlong, and Kaye. Beware this film if you're younger, though, because there is strong, strong racism, racial stimulated gore and violence, nudity and sex, and the worst of it all, a rape scene. Not for anyone under 17. If you see one film from 1998, see American History X.<br/><br/>10/10 --spy"

Very moving and powerful, and in my eyes the best performance of his career thus far. Edward Furlong's performance as Derek's little brother I felt was good, but not too exceptional. A few of his scenes just didn't sit right with me, maybe because of his age.

The ending is somewhat of a surprise, and a very drastic change in mood for the viewer.<br/><br/>All-in-all, the film has a great flow; easy to understand and very emotional. Why I gave it an 8 is probably due to watch ability. It's not a movie I'd sit and watch over and over, but more of one that I'd watch and leave on the shelf for a while.

"mattrochman","9","0","1","15 June 2006"," Almost flawless
","This film is a gem and a rather intelligent and poignant story. Extremely gripping and almost has educational value: I would not object to schools showing this to kids in the mid-teens.<br/><br/>But I have three complaints (the last two cost it one star).<br/><br/>First, Ed Norton being overlooked for the Oscar for his performance in this film simply goes to show you what a ""wank"" the Oscars really is. I'm sure that Roberto Benigni's performance in ""life is beautiful"" would have been terrific, but I'm prepared to hand the Oscar to Norton without even seeing Life is Beautiful for one simple reason: transformation. Acting a character who's personality and eccentricities are constant (eg.. Forrest Gump) is not nearly as difficult as playing a character who starts out as one type of person and transforms gradually to another throughout the film. Norton performs this to a tee and is, to date, the most under-rated actor to grace Hollywood - (did anyone else see his top-notch performance in the People vs Larry Flynt?) Second, there is an unnecessary addition to the story. At the end of the film, Norton walks his brother, Danny, to school and they stop off at a diner. Then the school principle and another guy rolls in and tells Norton that some of his old neo-Nazis mates were beaten up last night and he needs to re-infiltrate the group. Norton was protesting saying that his old ""friends"" are probably looking to do him in. I didn't really understand how this fitted into the story. What exactly were they trying to achieve with this extra piece of story that seemed somewhat out of place or superfluous to the film? All I can think is that they were re-iterating the fact that Norton won't so easily walk away from his old life, but this still seems unnecessary to me.<br/><br/>Third, I think the film was just a bit too peachy pie in some respects. From the moment that he starts folding sheets in jail with the likable and funny black guy, you know that somehow these two are going to strike up a friendship and this will play a pivotol roll in helping Norton to ""see the light"" and turn his life around. But the problem is that everything just happened too perfectly. First, he is raped by his neo-nazi friends for dissin' them and playing basketball with black guys. Just didn't seem to be credible in a way, but then again, i've never been in prison and shared a cell with Ben Dover and Bob Downe. Nonetheless, the fact that the neo-nazi's raped him instead of another ""group"" of inmates makes his ultimate rejection of neo-nazi ideology all the more.... ""perfect."" I'm not a neo-nazi advocate by the way. But what about this: after he diss's the neo-Nazis, they no longer protect him and in turn, he is beaten and raped by some random guy. See that is credible! But the writers desperately wanted him to be raped ""by his own"" so that his rejection of them and his transition to being a ""good and accepting"" person is peachy pie perfect.<br/><br/>I also found that the shooting of Danny at the end of the film was partly an attempt to ensure that the film doesn't have too much of a peachy pie perfect ending. As a result, I felt like there was something too deliberate about it and come to think of it, I think that the scene in the diner with Norton (as I mentioned above) was probably a distraction, so that we were more surprised by the fact that Danny was shot only a few minutes later. Even if I'm wrong, it seemed a bit too contrived and cost it a star.<br/><br/>Otherwise, brilliant film"

","I have to say that Ed Norton, Jr. is somewhat charismatic, but I have to assume he looks good or otherwise appeals to the ladies, because he rarely strikes me as a particularly great actor (although I have to admit that he was great and/or perfectly cast in The People vs. Larry Flynt). In other words, I rarely am dazzled by, stunned by or otherwise totally believing in the characters I have seen Ed Norton, Jr. play. He is the star of two of the most overrated films in history--Fight Club and American History X--both currently appearing in the top 50 here on IMDb.com. 50. The top 50 movies that have ever been made? Give me a break.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong--like Fight Club, American History X is an entertaining and interesting film that is certainly worth a look. Not for a second was I bored during either, and I have given this one a positive rating (6 out of 10). My problem is mainly with Ed Norton, Jr.'s acting. As is usually the case with Norton vehicles, at no point was I unaware that I was watching Ed Norton, Jr., and I had a load of trouble believing in his fanatical racist character here.<br/><br/>Maybe Mr. Norton just seems like too much of a nice guy to me. I do not hate the guy. I like him. Maybe that's my problem. In this one in particular, he really came across to me, somehow, as a person who is passionately opposed to racism. I felt he had trouble totally committing to the role, I guess. Not in an obvious way that I can really detail, but that's how I actually felt. It did not feel real to me.<br/><br/>If you disagree with my point about Norton, you'll probably love this flick just like almost everyone that bothered to comment on it here. Besides the unfortunate casting of Norton as fanatical racist, it was pretty good.<br/><br/>But speaking of fanaticism, I would really appreciate a little less fanaticism regarding Ed Norton, Jr.'s work. Really. Ed Norton, Jr. plays a fanatical racist? What's next? Ed Norton, Jr. plays Adolph Hitler? Ed Norton, Jr. plays Satan? Whatever. I think Norton needs to be cast in roles that are not quite as evil as his role here. The same exact problem plagues Fight Club as well as The Score. Something about his face, and his voice--it leaves a sort-of-cherubic impression, at least to me. He needs to be cast in more sympathetic and/or heroic roles like he was in The People vs. Larry Flynt."

","With fear comes prejudice. With prejudice comes bigotry. With bigotry comes hatred. With hatred comes violence. With violence comes incarceration. With incarceration comes more violence, which could sometimes lead to tolerance. This is how a vicious cycle comes full circle with a young man named Derek Vinyard.<br/><br/>""American History X"" is a movie about a young white male, with far above average intelligence whose father is murdered by a black gunman, is subsequently taught to hate. Instead of having the capacity to understand a bad coincidence for what it is, and let justice take its course, he turns the shooting into a racial incident. His inability to see the truth, digs a hole for himself that he may not be able to get out of.<br/><br/>The movie is put together with a series of flashbacks, alternating black & white scenes (the past) with color scenes (the present). Edward Furlong plays 16- year-old high school student, Daniel Vinyard, who has just been punished by his principal, for handing in an essay praising Adolf Hitler. His sentence: He must write a five-page essay covering the arrest, conviction, and incarceration of his older brother Derek, a Nazi skinhead.<br/><br/>Derek Vinyard, (Edward Norton), has just been released from prison on parole, for the shooting death of two blacks who were on his property, attempting grand theft. Even though he had the right to protect his family, he took vigilantism to an extreme. He was charged with second-degree murder.<br/><br/>Derek wants to turn his life around, close out his relationship with the neo-Nazi skinheads, and keep his brother Daniel as far away from them as possible. The problem is, that in the long time Derek spent in jail, Daniel had become much involved with the skinheads, their lifestyle, and their language. With his bald head and dark clothing, Daniel now even looks like a little skinhead.<br/><br/>Now the question is will Derek be able to convince Daniel to stay clear of the skinheads? And if he does, is Daniel too far involved to be saved? ""American History X"" is a good movie, but the ending is disturbing and sends a wrong message that is inconsistent with a story that begins pitifully, but progresses hopefully. The movie has too many flashbacks, and put together with the scenes in color make the film choppy in texture. Also the Edward Norton character never has the swastika on his chest surgically removed, which makes you wonder whether he has really changed. All In all, ""American History X"" is powerful movie, but not really a great one."

One dinnertime conversation with his father sets him down the road from intelligent, easygoing bookworm to belligerent tattooed Nazi skinhead? This just wasn't credible. His conversion FROM fascism, while much more thoroughly explored, is also unconvincing - he just seems to have abandoned his (ostensibly deeply held) convictions all too easily and completely. And frankly I saw the ending coming a mile away!

Sadly, I really did not care about the fate of Furlong's character. If there was a better actor in that role, it might have changed my feelings about the movie.<br/><br/>I certainly understand why American History X has an effect on many moviegoers. It is very professional piece of work and it does tackle the paradoxical nature of race. It could have been a great movie on the same level as Do The Right Thing. American History X is a good movie with one standout performance."

","This is my all time favorite movie! Edward Norton is such a legend! I just love the way this movie tackles real issues of todays society, and its not shy about being straight to the point about it. This really opened my eyes to the way I was living (very much the same as Derek) and I love Edward Furlongs quote at the end of the movie. Its great to have a movie that can speak to you like this and change the way you do things. American History X is a must see for everyone, it has superb performances from all the cast and a fantastic story! Edward Norton was robbed of an academy award for this film, no disrespect to Kevin Spacey or American Beauty, but I must say I think Edward Norton was better and had a far more challenging role to play. GO WATCH IT NOW!!!"

","I watched this film when I was about fifteen years old. As an African American I wanted to watch this film for understanding. I got that and more. The story follows the life of a former Neo-Nazi sent to prison for a hate crime he had committed. While imprisoned his beliefs are transformed for a more positive outlook. He returns home only to find his little brother following in his footsteps. The main character, Derek, portrayed by Edward Norton was your typical white Supremist; full of hatred and stupidity. This is the type of movie that you love to hate. It was very well-acted I personally believed that the Academy Award belonged to Edward Norton for best actor. I hate however, that his little brother, Danny(played by Edward Furlong), was murdered by a black man. Just when it seemed like Derek had came around, he could have very easily been pushed back into the hatred he had once embraced, by the premature death of his brother. Easily put: what goes around comes around, and it sucks. The musical score to this film was awesome, the instrumental score really brought depth and meaning to certain turning points in the film. This movie really displayed the consequences of our beliefs and actions, whether good or bad."

","American History X gives us an intense look into the ugly ramifications of racism & Neo-Nazism run amok in the lives of a select group of people in our society. AHX shows how even a microcosm of society's ""Aryan Brotherhood"" can vastly change people's lives forever. The basic plot is presented in an ""in your face"" demeanor, as well as paints a very realistic picture of exploding racism, territoriality & a deteriorating social fabric as we know it. <br/><br/>AHX pulls you in to the story of Derek Vinyard, an intelligent & arrogant young future Neo-Nazi leader who is sent to prison for manslaughter, reforms his hateful ways & beliefs while befriending a black inmate, gets out of prison to save his younger brother Danny from taking his former path, & makes a major choice to leave the Nazi gang for good with dire consequences. This is one powerful piece of film-making, with the viewer walking away to an unbelievable ending. It is not the controversial story that grabs you but the riveting performance by Edward Norton that will blow you away! <br/><br/>Edward Norton's performance as rising Neo-Nazi leader & reformed convict Derek Vinyard was as Oscar-worthy a bad guy as ""Silence of the Lambs"" Anthony Hopkin's Hannibal Lecter. Norton will make you hate him & love him in the same breath!! For such a young actor, Norton brings an innocence & veteran actor's skills to the film's success. With a solid supporting cast including Edward Furlong, Beverly D' Angelo, Fairuza Balk, Stacey Keach, Elliot Gould & Avery Brooks behind him, Norton flourishes in his role complete with foul mouth, toned physique, shaved head, and Nazi tattoos to complete the ensemble'.<br/><br/>This film gives the viewer a true sense of the hatred & bigotry expressed in each black & white flashback(the entire movie was done in most scenes shown in retrospect). I appreciated the ""hit over the head"" messages portrayed which does not glorify but brings responsibility to the outright & overt prejudice running rampant throughout the film. <br/><br/>For those who accept realism & can handle blatant truth, I highly recommend anyone to see this film, over the age of 18, of course. AHX is a wake-up call to all those who enjoy a film with teeth, and boy does this one bite you!! Tony Kaye does a wonderful job bringing together competent actors, smart technical film-making, & a very, very controversial & sensitive plot. After viewing AHX, you never know; you just might learn something!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

","This was an awesome, almost mind-blowing movie. Until I saw this movie on a late night re-run recently on cable, I was always thinking that Edward Norton was overrated and he irritated me in some movies like The Italian Caper. This should have gotten him an Oscar nomination at least (for what it's worth). Maybe it did. Edward Furlong was also superb in a supporting role. I don't see him in movies recently, and I wondered what happened to him? I have a tough time enjoying child actors with big parts in the movies generally, but Furlong in Terminator 2 was one of the very few that seemed really natural and didn't grate. That guy has talent, not just another pretty face.<br/><br/>Back to the movie itself, this was a powerful depiction of the scary force and pull of the hatred between races movement. By following the evolution of Edward Norton's character and the resulting circumstances, people around him, the movie was not sermonial, but extremely persuasive and compelling in showing us the consequences of this never ending cycle of rage. <br/><br/>Which should not be inevitable.<br/><br/>Awesome movie."

","I've read other comments and I think most people don't get the idea. Everybody writes ""This movie shows us that violence is not the way to deal with..."". In my opinion that's the mildest version of what this movie shows us, because American History X is about reality and in real life , if a dog bites you, you have to react. Nobody can sit and watch while their brothers, sisters, sons or daughters get wasted in the street. I think that every man would react violently to that. It's just that it doesn't happen to everyone.<br/><br/>In other words, this movie shows us that it doesn't matter if you run, hide, or even if you try being nice to it, the rabid dog will try to bite you. So the only option is to fight for your life and for your family.<br/><br/>I think this is Ed Norton's best role since Primal Fear. He is truly a Neo-Nazi and he leaves the impression that he believes in his preachings. The only part I couldn't get was Norton's 180 degree turn in prison. I mean, a man of his beliefs wouldn't just start crying in front of his sworn enemy and then give up all his life's ideas just because of a rape.<br/><br/>All that said, I still rated this movie 10, because it's a true story of men and dogs."

"dromasca","9","0","2","30 April 2005"," powerful anti-hate drama
","'American History X' is nowadays almost a cult movie, one of the category that seems to get better with the time. This is probably because of the very actual message and the strong story of a family caught in the racial and gangs conflicts of the 90s Los Angeles. The messages that hate does not solve problems and that tentatives to reconcile cannot wipe overnight deep-rooted problems are still strong and universal, and the movie looks as actual as the day it hit the screens.<br/><br/>It is also the best movie of Edward Norton, in the principal role of the pro-Nazi gang leader who kills two Afro-American who were trying to stole his car. He is shown the day of his liberation, trying to re-build his life and wipe over his violent past, but meantime he became a model for the racial hate groups in the neighborhood and for his younger brother. If there is hope beyond the violent conflict it's in the tentative of some of the characters to bring some sanity, but the message is open and the tragic end avoids the typical rose water endings of the Hollywood movies.<br/><br/>I liked this film, it talked to me length about race conflict, hate, appeasing, forgiveness. As I said, it's more actual than ever. 9 out of 10 on my personal scale."
"TheNorthernMonkee","9","0","2","21 April 2005"," powerful film with an important message
","SPOILERS April 2005 and Britain is held in the grips of a general election. Voting to decide who will become the next Prime Minister of the country, one of the key topics seems to be immigration. Pioneered by a Conservative leader who is seemingly obsessed, the issue has brought up the old trend of racial tension. What happens though when you stop perceiving an awkward subject as a problem, and begin to passionately hate all those who are different from you. In ""American History X"", Ed Norton provides perhaps his finest ever performance as a reformed Neo-Nazi with a mission. Powerful from start to finish, the film is not afraid to show the views of the extremist, whilst simultaneously proving the flaws in their arguments.<br/><br/>Derek Vinyard (Norton) is the figurehead leader of a bunch of Neo-Nazi's in Venice Beach. Full of anger and hatred, Derek devotes his life to winning the area back for the whites. After a spell in prison however, Derek reappears dramatically different. Keen to get out of the way of life, he finds that his former associates are not that easy to escape from as he attempts to stop his younger brother Danny (Ed Furlong) from going down the same route.<br/><br/>Written by David McKenna, ""American History X"" is a film that everybody should see. Whilst not the finest for direction and far from the finest film ever, it is a crucial film due it's solid performances, and the message it provides.<br/><br/>As the bitter and twisted Derek, Ed Norton is indescribable. Playing an incredibly clever character, Norton manages to play the character as someone who has an underlying hatred beneath the surface, and who believes a view which he can't even convincingly argue for in a debate. Norton can give the character a sense of menace, whilst simultaneously giving a sense of internal misery and weakness. Some might suggest that the simple reason for this menace is that it tends to only be present when he has a shaved head, but this isn't true. This, almost terrifying, display which the character portrays is based on Norton's ability to walk the walk as it were and show an arrogance of sorts. Anyone can shave their head and attempt to look tough, but Norton succeeds, not through the lack of hair, but through his actions.<br/><br/>One example of a character who can shave their head but never actually look even remotely intimidating is Edward Furlong's Danny. Played to perfection by Furlong, this character never really looks anything but a young, naive, scared boy with an admiration for his brother. Throughout the film, we see someone on the verge of fully committing to an ideal, but who never actually seems to commit. To Danny it always feels more like he is trying to imitate his brother whilst trying to belong to a group. Again, this is down not to a script, but purely down to an outstanding turn by Furlong.<br/><br/>Perhaps the greatest thing about ""American History X"" is the way that we are shown the errors of Derek's ways. In so many ways, this film could have evolved into an arrogant story which preaches at you like a religious leader. It avoids this though. What ""American History X"" does is that for segments it shows family debates where views are discussed across a dinner table. We hear points of view about the extremity of equality in the work place, and we listen to ideas which have SOME logic and reasoning behind them. Through discussion and alternative events however, the film shows that the majority of these views are lacking. We are shown that there are extremists from both sides who argue both for liberalism and for fascism, but that ultimately all of these views are irrelevant. So much could be said about the eventual conclusions of ""American History X"" that hours could be spent on one part of the overall view. Ultimately though, the film demonstrates that actions speak louder than words and we should remember that.<br/><br/>""American History X"" is not the best made film ever, but it is one of the most important. In a world today where race and issues surrounding the topic is so dominant, we need films like this. Superbly acted, and brilliantly thought out, it is a film to be watched and absorbed."

","This movie is one of the best films dealing with Nazism and how hatred can destroy your life. Lots of people who have not seen this movie think it is pro Nazi belief. It is not that at all, it shows that racism and Anti-Semitism is a thing of the past and that hating people for their race and religion doesn't improve your life. It revolves around a very troubled and misguided young man Derek Vinyard (Ed Norton)who winds up killing two black kids and gets 3 years in jail for it. In the pen Derek learns that what he did had no good effect on his life at all and it didn't better his situation. The flash backs are so well done and the things Derek does and what happens to him really make you feel sorry for him.<br/><br/>Derek's transformation from skin head to a good person does not come without a price. He has differences with other Nazis in jail which leads to him being their ""wife"". After this happens he realizes what wrongs he has done in his life and he now tries to fix them. When released from jail Derek realizes that his brother Danny is headed down the same path as him. This results in Derek ending his tenure with his Nazi friends and telling Danny why he had to do this. The end of the movie shows that old wounds do not heal and he ends up paying the ultimate price for it.<br/><br/>The message they are trying to put forth in this film is that hate is just extra baggage and that we need to stop hating what we don't understand. It is a very compelling story and it makes you realize how much hate and resentment there still is in this world."

","What can I say, this movie is hands down the best of 1998 and one of the best films of the decade. This movie was definitely underrated when it came out, and Edward Norton should've won an Academy Award for his tour-de-force performance, and also the director, Tony Kaye for best director.<br/><br/>This movie tells the story of Derek Vinyard (Norton) a young man in Venice Beach, California. The story is narrated by his younger brother, Danny, played by Edward Furlong, who is following his big brother's footsteps by being part of a neo-Nazi skinhead group, and basically taking his life and future down the drain. Danny's professor, played by Avery Brooks gives him an assignment on his own big brother after he had done a previous one on Hitler, and the professor of course, rejected it.<br/><br/>The movie goes back and forward in time through Danny's narration to highlight the events leading to Derek ending up in prison for three years, and later on the story is told from Derek's own perspective starting from the time he went to prison until he gets out. There's also a strong supporting cast here; Avery Brooks is great as Danny's professor Dr. Sweeney, Ethan Suplee does a very good job as Seth, who is close to Danny and Derek and also shares the same beliefs, Stacy Keach as Cameron, the leader of the local skinhead group, Fairuza Balk as Derek's girlfriend Stacy, and Beverly D'Angelo as Derek and Danny's mother, all do a great job in their respective roles. The movie is very gripping and it will keep you glued to your seat whether you're a fan of this genre or not, because the performances are sizzling. This is by far one of Edward Norton's best roles in his career. The movie touches on a topic not many movies dare to touch on, racism, and has strong pervasive language and some very disturbing scenes, so it's not for everyone, but it's an Oscar-worthy movie nonetheless. A rare underrated gem. Ten out of ten!"

This may have been a very controversial movie and i can understand that but I think the people who did not see this movie because of the high rate of racism should see it for what it shows about the society many people are in and how it can ruin your life along with the ones you love.

"buskk7642","10","0","1","21 February 2005"," The most powerful film concerning racism ever made!
","American History X: Starring Edward Norton, Edward Furlong, Avery Brooks and Beverly D'Angelo Written by David McKenna, Directed by Tony Kaye (New Line Cinema, 1998)<br/><br/>****/ out of 4.<br/><br/>From its brutal and powerful opening scene till the bitter end, American History X is a rare film that crosses the line between cinema and art. Through its bold and fearless acting (especially Edward Norton, absolutely brilliant) clever writing and masterful direction, American History X challenges the viewer to face the truth about hate in today's society. <br/><br/>From the beginning of his career, Edward Norton has continually progressed as an actor constantly challenging himself artistically with projects that push the envelope of mainstream film-making and American History X is the prime example of his dedication. Norton plays Derek Vineyard, a former neo-Nazi skin head who just served three years in prison for killing a black gang member in self defense. Seeing the error in his ways, he returns from prison reformed vowing to stop his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) from going down a similar path. From the beginning, Norton is nothing short of brilliant in his Oscar nominated role. His dedication was both emotional and physical; Norton gained 30 pounds of muscle for the role and is covered in tattoos, including a swastika. His presence and intensity command the screen so convincingly that the viewer needs to be reminded they're watching a film, not a documentary. In one of the film's most powerful scenes, Derek is talking to his brother about what happened to him in prison and what changed him. Norton uses body language and eye movement to create the most memorable monologue in recent film history. He looks at Danny with such conviction and says ""Looking back I can't believe I bought into all this s#$@, all this hate, this anger. It's just because I was p------ off, and I'm tired of being p------ off, Danny, it's not worth it."" Aside from Norton, the supporting cast even the most trivial roles are top notch. Edward Furlong is perfect as Derek's brother Danny who's confused about his views and searching for truth in the ugly world of racism consumed by propaganda and contradiction. The rest of the cast including Guy Torry, Beverly D'Angelo and Avery Brooks as Derek's black High School English teacher who ends up mentoring him and steering him down the right path.<br/><br/>The central point of the entire film is that hate and anger is nothing but baggage. The script carried this out with it's pace, intense dialogue and construction but the film needed a director with a strong visual sense to show the viewer what hate does to a society, a family and a man. Tony Kaye not only directed the film but also operated the camera for the film and was the lead cinematographer. Visually, the film is a flat out masterpiece from start to finish. By using color changes, time sequencing, and flashbacks, the film uses visuals to tell the story and metaphorically shed light on racism.When we see Derek out of prison, the film is shown in color to show how he sees everything clearly. While Derek is in prison and while he still had racist views, the film is shown in black and white to symbolize how he and other racists did not see minorities as people, just statistics. In the film's most beautiful scene, Derek returns home from prison and has reformed in his ways. He spends time with Danny and one by one, they take down all the posters and banners promoting racism and hate hanging in their room. Derek quietly out of the room to take a shower. The lush cinematography captures every single water drop as it falls off his body. The scene is crosscut with a flashback of Derek and Danny together on the beach as young children. The scene suggests all he has to live for and his love for his brother. At the end of scene, Derek steps out of the shower refreshed, as if he's just washed away his sins and has forgiven himself for his past. He looks in the mirror and slowly places his right hand over his heart, covering his swastika tattoo. Though very little is spoken, this scene is at the heart of the film's purpose and passion.<br/><br/>The reason the film is so brilliant and why it works is the way the script is handled and translated to screen. The film proves its point about hate and anger through pacing, clever dialogue and offers an intelligent point of view on controversial issues impacting today's society. Issues such as gang violence, the job market and the Rodney King trials are topics concerning Americans today. The white supremacists are viewed as highly educated people with intelligent opinions concerning the issues of minorities in our society. The film looks at these points objectively and suggests that while these points are good, they are biased, unfair and illogical considering the basis for these arguments are hate and anger.<br/><br/>American History X is quite simply the best film concerning racism ever made. It's more than just a great piece of cinema; it's a work of art. Through the powerful performances, masterful direction and thought provoking script, American History X is a testament to the truth about hate in our society and our world."

He showed more intelligence then anyone expected him to show.<br/><br/>.. the fact that he learned from his mistakes showed that he was a much stronger person then any of his old friends. Also when he was in jail he befriended an African American only because he saw that the other white supremacist in the jail didn't care what color people were they sold drugs with people from another race and hurt people of their own color, so he saw that it didn't really matter what color you are just if you help them .. he knew it was all a fake and a lie, and he knew he had to get out of it for his life and the life of his family.<br/><br/>.. basically saying, this movie was amazing and I'm very proud that it was made because if it wasn't then maybe people wouldn't know what they know that. people don't hate color, they hate themselves."

","""American History X"" is one of the most graphic, brutally honest, harrowing, and challenging films you'll ever get to experience. Period. Featuring Edward Norton as a reformed Neo-Nazi, immersed into an endless cycle of hate and just released from prison with a dire awakening for tolerance, this is a study that doesn't question its subjects' animosities and hostilities as much as it delves into their world, consumed by social depravity and intolerance towards all, endeavoring wherever and whenever they might simply to promote white supremacy across America. The narrative is Derek Vinyard (Norton)'s younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong), who is assigned, nay, obligated, to write a paper detailing his influence Derek's path to social degradation so that he might better understand how to grip with his embedded anger and perhaps relinquish it. There's nothing pretty about this harrowing and powerful story, yet it demands to be hearkened: it's brutal and incendiary, taking us deep inside a culture of hate, and having us understand the roots of the subjects' animosities. It's timeless and timely, unequivocal and unflinching, and it is about as uncompromising as a series of dour blows to the face, and then some. Watching this incredibly potent and brutally honest study of the roots, repercussions, and reformations of a culture of hate is a transformation of reckoning: its tone is dark (manifested in black and white cinematography), and whatever message that is trying to be conveyed, it is sincere, yet not entirely hopeful. Edward Norton is astoundingly human, in encompassing the chastity, and evoking the chilling menace of deep-seated abomination. This is one of the most powerful human studies I have ever endured: it is intent on tackling the most consuming quality of man in examining its sources and its brutal extent of barbarity and inhumanity, even showing us that hate and prejudice is so powerful it can collapse even the dearest relations. The plot is structured scatalogically rather than chronologically, so that multiple themes can be examined at once, never settling for the here and now, but rather than the then and now to advance its themes and an understanding of its subjects' plighted deviances. In conclusion, one can hardly excoriate ""Histoy"" for exonerating Derek, Danny, and their Neo-Nazi cults, but rather, the film barrages the culture of hate, wherever and however it exists, because in the end, it squanders even the brightest potentials (e.g. Derek) and makes enemies of us all. The ending is exceedingly disturbing for me, as it virtually contradicts some critical and seemingly discernible themes developed throughout the film, of acceptance and tolerance through brutal reformation. Perhaps the message that Kaye is trying to elicit is that the cycle of hate perpetuates throughout cultures, and consumes and ultimately destroys its subjects. ""American History X"" is a contemporary cornerstone for cultures everywhere, that will only re assuredly resonate through time. **** out of ****"
"timmyfish","9","0","1","31 January 2005"," An unsettling in-depth look at the struggle between reason and frustration
","Racial issues are not black and white- but enough with the cheap shots. What I think separates this movie from others of its kind is(apart from its awesome style and the performance of the cast) its tone towards racism. Instead of portraying the skinheads as idiots or demons, people that are beyond reason and understanding, it shows why anyone would become a skinhead. The answer is: for roughly the same reasons one would join a gang. Namely, affirming your dignity and identity by hating everybody else. When people start to hate entire races, they aren't thinking about a causal relation between criminal tendencies and skin pigmentation. Or about the metaphysically controversial notion that entire groups may somehow be responsible for the actions of individual members. They're not asking themselves whether ""groups"" as such actually even exist. In short, they aren't thinking logically: they're using perverted inductive logic to project their frustrations onto people they don't identify with. They treat these people as scapegoats. A coping strategy, as frightening as it is obscure. A phenomenon that seems to recur throughout human history, each time adapting itself to the spirit of the times. In this movie, Edward Norton en Edward Furlong both convincingly play bright but frustrated skinheads. They allow the viewer to understand the horrifying appeal that the racist rhetoric might have. And I found myself provoked to re-evaluate my own opinion on the matter. Affirmative action, racial profiling: what am I to make of these things? What would I do if I would encounter racial violence? Violence in general? How do we stop it? For once, this question, as well as the movie, is an honest one. I don't even know if it's possible. But it's going to take guts. that's for sure. So did this movie."

","American History X is a movie about a boy who's brother has been in a Nazi-clan. The boy's name Daniel Vinyard and his brother is Dereck Vinyard. Daniel also becomes member of the clan. He sees his big brother as a kind of living example for his own lifestyle. Daniel had turned in a paper about ""Mein Kampf"" at school. The teacher ( who by the way is a dark-colored person ) does not accept it. He gives Daniel the order to write a paper about his brother's life. That's what the movie is about. In the movie you can see flashbacks about the life of Dereck and the actions he undertook with his clan. These actions are quite hard actions. Every not-white person was an evil person. But the strong thing about the movie is that not only Dereck and his clan are described as ""bad"" persons, also the ""dark-colored"" persons are evil. Both gangs are making rude actions and killing each other. The way the interaction between the two groups is described is very impressive. The movies characterizes in a good way too what wrong rascism can lead, from both sides. The end is also very impressive. I would say, watch the movie and your vision about rascism will change in a positive way. It is actually a non-necessary way of behaving. All people are equal and need to be threatened in that way.

Derek's partner in crime Cameron Alexander influences Danny's beliefs. after three years, Derek is released, and finds that his brother's future is not too far from Derek's past.

","This film, more than any other, is a treatise on hatred; its' laws, dynamics and consequences.

But those arguments are not so much intended to persuade, as to tap into deep human instincts of self preservation. Those fears trigger anger, and rational thought becomes distorted.<br/><br/>A powerful metaphor for the entire film occurs in the brief scene where Daniel begins his ""American History X"" essay. He types in the line ""Analyze and interpret"". As the line repeats down the page it mutates and becomes increasingly incoherent, then abruptly rematerializes in a reconstituted form that looks similar to the starting point, but is in fact vulgar.

"butterfinger","Null","0","1","16 October 2004"," Cheap melodrama.
","American History X is impressive for one reason: it is probably the only feel-good movie about neo-nazism in modern cinema. It's about a troubled young man named Derek (Edward Norton) who becomes a skinhead after some black men murder his father. He goes to prison for murdering two black men and leaves prison with a clearer view of the absurdities of the choices he made in the past. His younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) is already following his footsteps, with his head shaved and his bedroom decked in nazi posters; it is up to Derek to tell Danny about his past mistakes and to try to keep Danny from making them. Surprisingly, so little of this material is handled with any guts; there is only cheap melodrama (don't get me started about the use of slow-motion) and unnecessary preaching. Even when it tries to give us a tough ending, it feels stapled on. Also, notice that the only two charismatic and movie-star-like skinheads (Norton and Furlong) are the ones that director Tom Kaye (who later disowned the film) chose to portray? Wouldn't the film be more daring and interesting if it were a study of Seth Ryan (played horrifyingly by Ethan Suplee), Derek's fat, dumb, insanely angry bulldog friend? Norton is the most endearing and likable actor in Hollywood and to cast him as the skinhead that the film studies is too easy.<br/><br/>(Another problem with the film, character-wise, is that the characters are all, pretty much, cartoons and only in a film this problematic would this criticism be put in parentheses.)"

At the start of the movie Derek Vinyard is a skinhead leader of a white power movement. At the end he is no longer a man filled with hate, he becomes a man full of love for his family. Derek also pays the ultimate price for what he used to do with the death of Danny who is his brother who loves him to death.<br/><br/>American History X is brilliant with the bits in Black and White, this is a great symbol because when Derek was a skinhead for him it was just white people against black people. But when its in color he sees everyone as equal.<br/><br/>The end of the movie is very sad and emotional, when Danny gets shot and Derek comes running in and starts crying it is one of the most emotional scenes I have ever seen. The way that he would loved his brother was so great and he knows that it Danny's death could be blamed on him.<br/><br/>How Edward Norton didn't get nominated for an Oscar proves that the Oscar Commitie Board vote for people in politically correct movies.

"michaelgs","Null","0","1","8 October 2004"," Powerful imagery; lacking in originality
","This is a powerful film with a great performance by Ed Norton, and I believe a must see for many people of all colors. So, if you aren't interested in wrecking some of that imagery, go ahead and watch it. If you are fascinated that a man would deign to criticize American History X, than read on.<br/><br/>(potential spoilers ahead)<br/><br/>The fact is, this movie is so busy painting a stinging, unblinking portrait of racism (on both sides) in America that, with the exception of Ed Norton, it doesn't take the time to create characters that we care about, or cause its characters to develop in any kind of realistic way. The story is primarily about Norton, and how he becomes the leader of a white supremacist gang, then turns away from racism while in prison, and finally tries to convince his younger brother of the errors of neo-Naziism. We never really see much of the development of Ed Norton's racism, nor do we see the neo-Nazi kingpin that works on him and his brother but in a few scenes. The Principal that supposedly represents all that is right and good in this movie is incredibly, profoundly two-dimensional. The movie wears increasingly conventional toward the end, and closes with a monologue given by a character that sounded like Cardinal Tutu, not a kid who has undergone a values shift a matter of hours before. Which brings me to another point about this movie. I cannot think of a situation where a 16-year-old would be able to throw away everything he has been taught all his life on the basis of one conversation. He would probably get very confused, then mad at being confused, and lack any kind of security whatsoever. True value shifts take time, and even the most conventional movies will generally allow some time for that to develop. It almost begs the question if this whole movie is really a pro-racism movie done tongue-in-cheek.<br/><br/>Many scenes of the movie I enjoyed, and many more scenes challenged me. But this movie has far too many characters that work so hard to represent one side or another that they miss the first point of any movie: to be interesting characters we can care about. So it works well as a movie that shows the seediest sides of modern racial bigotry, but as a real movie with an original plot and a message you can really buy, it fails.<br/><br/>6/10"

","American History X, directed by Tony Kaye and starring Edward Norton, is a film that provides a look at racial hatred from white, neo-Nazi 'skinheads, towards Jews, blacks, and Mexican cultures. It also shows an 'oppressed African-Americans' viewpoint towards whites and the community.<br/><br/>The movie begins when Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton), a neo-Nazism supporter, kills two black men trying to steal his vehicle. He is sent to prison for three years. On the day Derek is released, his younger brother Danny Vinyard (Beverly D' Angelo), who had become a strong neo-Nazism supporter while his brother was in prison, is told to write a paper on his brother Derek's life leading up to the night of the murders by his principle, DR. Bob Sweeney (Avery Brooks). As Danny writes the paper, the movie sets itself in flashbacks of Derek's life, including events leading him to join the 'skinheads' and many of his opinions of the different races in America as leader of a faction of the White Power movement. That night, Danny goes to a party where there are Hitler look-alikes, swastikas, and white power music. When the reformed Derek finds out that his brother is at the party, he goes to get him and to tell the leader of the neo- Nazis to stay away from his little brother. While there, a fight breaks out between Derek and his former friend. Danny confronts Derek and the movie is then again set in flashbacks of Derek's time in prison and how he was reformed. After telling Danny of his prison experiences, including befriending and African-American falsely accused of assault. Derek and Danny go home and take down Danny's Hitler Posters and neo- Nazi contraband. American History X briefly shows views of racial hatred from the standpoints of white 'skinheads' and black gang members. It also gives a glimpse into prison life and the different racial groups that form there. Aside from that, it touches on family unity and sibling friendship.<br/><br/>Much of the movies appeal comes from the flashbacks, which are entirely black and white. The flashbacks range everywhere from Derek Vinyard's High School years, to his time after prison. However, the present time frame, represented in color, is set in a one day period. Norton gives a great acting performance and his body tattoos, including a big swastika on his chest, are visually amazing. American History X is a must see."

His poor little brother was trying to make sense of everything that was going on in his world, and just when he was starting to understand it and learn how to change it, he was killed.

"Soul_Device","Null","0","1","1 September 2004"," One of my top 10
","This film is rated R for a reason. Several actually, including graphic brutal violence (one homosexual rape scene), pervasive language (according to one source the word ""f**k"" appears 205 times), sex and nudity. So why did I give it an 8.0? Well, considering the story (and with the exception of the opening bedroom scene) I would not consider any of this inappropriate. The scene mentioned above is totally unnecessary to the plot (except maybe to illustrate how angry the two characters are) and so the breast shot and the rather vocal sex are rather gratuitous. While it is true that some of the other scenes (such as the prison rape) could have been left to the imagination I think that a lot of the film's considerable power would have been lost.<br/><br/>This is the story of the head of neo-nazi skinhead gang who murders a gang banger and goes to prison only to find loyal (and needed) friendship in a black man who saves him from almost certain death. He gets out and seeks to turn his brother away from the skinhead movement before it is too late. The story rocks. It is strong because it does not simply paint either side as idiots like many anti-racist films do. There are plausible reasons for the hero's racism and it is easy to see how he was led down the path to murder. At the same time it is made abundantly clear that racism is ultimately foolish and self destructive - especially if taken to its logical conclusion. <br/><br/>No suspension of belief required here - this is a very true-to-life film. I've seen some whining over details on other review sites that all seem pretty petty to me. Some have commented that the friendship in prison was not believable - that the hero would have not become anti-racist simply based on one person's actions. That is certainly possible - but he is also shown as being rather open minded prior to his father's death, and easily malleable. Once the stereotypes on both sides were torn down (by a black friend and a skinhead enemy) and he saw the reality of the situation he came to the correct conclusion.<br/><br/>The theme is obviously anti-racist which is excellent of course. One thing I am glad to see for once is that racism is not overcome in this film by becoming ""proud of one's race"" (i.e. more racism), nor is either race held up as particularly noble or without fault in the issue. People need to be judged by their actions - prejudicial hatred is wrong regardless of its basis, pure and simple.<br/><br/>9.5/10"

","""American History X"" starts with a bang and ends with one as well. When this film was first being released in theatres, there was a storm of controversy surrounding it due the violent and graphic content; however, ""American History X"" turned out to become even less violent than one of the most violent films of the 1990's ""Natural Born Killers."" <br/><br/>Edward Norton gives the performance of his career as a reformed Neo-Nazi determined to deter his brother, Edward Furlong, from the life he once held. Norton is Derek Vinyard a skinhead sent to prison for murdering two black boys in front of his home for trying to steal his truck. Norton's performance in ""American History X"" reminds me of an earlier film called ""Primal Fear."" <br/><br/>Edward Furlong plays Derek's younger brother named Danny. Danny, who has always looked up to Derek enters the life his brother Derek led. Derek leaves prison with the knowledge that Danny is in the hateful life he once led and he makes it his mission to get him and his family out of the life.<br/><br/>""American History X"" has a lot of detailed scenes of violence, and language that opened my eyes to this awful lifestyle. I thought to myself, How could people be so ignorant as to hate others because of their skin.<br/><br/>This is one of the top movies of 1998. Everybody who watches this film is in for a real treat because there is a twist at the end, which is needed to make the story come complete circle. ""American History X"" is a film of the journey that travels from the deepest depths of darkness to peak of doing what is right."

","American History X is undoubtedly one of the very best movies ever made, despite the controversial elements shown in it. Edward Norton, Edward Furlong, Avery Brooks, Ethan Suplee, Elliott Gould, and Stacy Keach are all excellent in this film (they're all great actors, and I'd like to add that Beverly D'Angelo is good as the mother). I must admit that I found some of the words and quotes used by the characters in the film to be hilarious. However, the main things I hated to see were the black kids picking on and beating up on the white kids, and I especially hated to see Edward Furlong getting shot to death in the end (this was for no reason at all, if you ask me). It would've been something else if there were more to the movie (or perhaps a sequel) after Edward Furlong was shot, for the viewers would've known more about how Edward Norton (as well as the rest of the cast that made up the Vinyard family) dealt with it. Although this film is controversial and labeled as ""racist"" by some people, I personally think that it's a very strong and important film because it does tell the truth about how some parts of society operate. I personally recommend viewing of this film to Sociology classes everywhere because this movie strongly emphasizes the presence of and problems caused by racism in society."

","To those who say the movie is poorly done, maybe you should sit down and watch the movie again.  Edward Norton is an amazingly imposing figure. During the scene where he gets arrested that so many people allude to, he raises his hands and turns around, tattoos showing and a smile so evil you want to puke.  He has zero remorse.  <br/><br/>How he got to be this way is somewhat inconsequential but his father's death and political views on being passed over for a job are the root of that problem.  His control lover the household, and his younger brother is amazing.<br/><br/>Once in prison he realizes that everything is not as he was lead to believe. The white supremacists that he meets are completely different than what he expects.  Norton has actually bought into the true image and cause of white supremacy.  When he finds out that is not at the heart of the movement he changes forever.  Having a black friend in the slammer and being raped didn't exactly help him to love his ""white brothers""<br/><br/>Upon release he feverishly begins the efforts to change the fortunes of his family for good.  The ending is sad, but it gives the movie something most do not have in Hollywood, realism.  not everyone forgets.<br/><br/>A fabulous movie, and one that is not for the weak of stomach.  violent, racial, angry and profane.  But well done.<br/><br/>One last note: many people make comments about the dinner table scene with Elliott Gould.  To me this is a fantastic scene where the one person you know you are supposed to disagree with (Norton) says some things that actually make sense.  Watch the movie and be enlightened, you won't forget it."

","American History X<br/><br/>The film American History X highlights the problems of race in America. Throughout the history of the country, America has been considered a fairly racist union. Written by David McKenna and directed by Tony Kaye, the film unfolds through the eyes of Danny Vineyard (Edward Furlong), who idolizes his old brother, Derek (Edward Norton), a former neo-nazi skinhead. They both come under the influence of a neo-Nazi, who befriends white youths living in Venice beach. When their father is murdered by a black, Derek is consumed by pain, grief and anger, eventually leading him to the skinheads. When he murders two blacks trying to steal his car, he is sent to prison, where he undergoes a transformation. He actually meets a black man, for the first time in his life; he changes his mind partly because he learns something, which is what prevent the film from being infuriating. He leaves a changed man, who attempts to rescue his younger brother from a similar fate. In the film there are unnerving scenes of racial violence: of blacks youth kicking a helpless white student in a high school restroom; of a Korean-owned grocery store terrorized by skinheads thugs; of an African American whose skull is split open by a skinhead who orders him to lie face down on a curb. I think anyone really loves this movie, but nobody really dislikes it. I have seen American History X four times and, for me, it is my favourite film. It is a masterpiece. I recommend everybody to see this movie because they feel opposite feelings during the movie. If I have to mark this film, my note is 9.5/10."

","I have seen this twice now, the first time was shortly after it's release. I thought highly of it when first released, Edward Norton was convincing in his role and the gritty violence portrayed in the film left an impression with me.<br/><br/>Having seen it again and cast a far more critical eye upon it I would find it difficult to give it much more than a 6/10. The acting is above par but the story seems poor paced and the characters shallow.<br/><br/>The basketball scene was one that I really didn't appreciate. Norton is elbowed early on by a black player (can you really blame him after Norton proudly displays his swastika tattoo), this is supposedly to make him the victim/hero of the scene. The crass triumphal music is supposed to raise us up with him as he and his white supremacist stooges triumph over the local 'monkeys'.

Stacy Keach is spot-on, and, I hate to say it, but Ed Furlong turns in a pretty good performance. Too bad the acting was scuppered by the script. (I know about the controversy involved with the director, and would hate to think that this film was screwed up for no other reason than dueling egos.) The film starts strong, but devolves into an after-school special. Ed Norton's transformation is wholly unbelievable---a prison gang-rape is a heckuva road-to-Damascus moment--and the writing becomes obnoxiously pat. This film has a ""message"", but, ironically, the tone makes it unpalatable. Too bad."

","I have seen Edward Norton in The Italian Job, and found him to be the standout in the ensemble cast, playing the villain quite convincingly enough for the type of film it was. I saw him in Fight Club and thought he was a knock out, playing his character to absolute perfection. Then in Rounders, where his character is not only charming and funny, but had deep emotional problems concerning his personal life. He was wonderful in that role as well. But his performance in American History X certainly without a doubt tops them all. I knew before hand that Edward Norton would play a neo-Nazi type character, but I was expecting some sort of lapse in his character. Thoughout the two hours and some odd minutes, he had me in utter shock as to what he put those around him through. It amazed me how much change happened to him, how his character went from respecting other races, to plain despise, anger, and hate, to redemption. His eyes say so much throughout the film, were so penetrating to the audience, that it amazed me that I couldn't turn my own eyes away.  His actions were so powerful, his voice so convincing to others, that for a second there, he had me thinking his own views. If I had been under his leadership, I would have absolutely believed him.<br/><br/>The film revolves around Derek Vinyard the day he gets out of prison, and how he tries to convince his younger brother from taking the same path as he did. The flashbacks are in black and white, and the story told in the first half through the eyes of his younger brother, Danny. Edward Furlong, though not as powerful as Norton's, was still very convincing, though I thought his character was too trusting too fast near the end. The ending had me in tears. It had shocked me so badly. <br/><br/>The film is powerful, will deeply pull at your heart, and leave you with a lasting impression, not only about American society, but at the never ending racism that occurs within the world. It will never end, but this film shows that even those with so much hate and anger within them can be redeemed. I highly recommended this film. <br/><br/>MJR"

It is a movie about inevitability. Not hope or justice or anything like that. its beautiful that he becomes a new person blah blah blah but it doesnt change who he was and it can't change the destiny his brother was set out on because of it.<br/><br/>and the reason the dinner scene was in the movie was because it showed that what a parent says, lightly, offhandedly in normal conversation, can have a profound effect on their children.

If ranking great performances, then yes, Edward Norton certainly qualifies: his turn as a neo-Nazi skinhead is stunning, possibly one of the most powerful portrayals of pure hatred.  Covering the gamut from heartbreaking to frightening, he never lets the character degenerate into a cliche.<br/><br/>If only the same could be said for the rest of the movie.  American History X is unquestionably preachy, and even if it's a good kind of preachy (I like the ending, although to many it will be predictable), it's too by-the-numbers approach hinders the filmmakers' ambition to make a profound message movie.  Save Norton, the rest of the players could be cardboard cutouts from any after-school special about bigotry and diversity.<br/><br/>But, of course, an after-school special wouldn't include homosexual rape.<br/><br/>And despite its shortcomings, watch this movie.

Its a great movie that i would hope Could have an impact on these kind of people who still beleive in a ""Master race"", and one could ask themselves, if there is a master race, who am i to say its white!!! and i am white, so i am definately not taking a biased view but a logical and educated one.

","American History X is one of those rare films that you can watch over and over and over again, for days on end, and still vividly enjoy it, each time. Edward Norton (as Derek Vinyard) gives what many will agree to be the performance of his (or anyones) career. In a stark physical transformation, he bulks up, shaves his head, grows out a goatee, and seethes with positive hatred for everything he's not. It is a literally awesome performance. Also noteworthy are, Edward Furlong as Dereks younger brother Danny, Stacy Keach as the slyly manipulative Cameron Alexander, and Ethan Suplee as the dangerously temperamental Seth. All these characters seem as if they were derived from actual people, and their performances equal that credibility. A warning: American History X is not for the faint of heart, it is a violent, stark, blunt, and certainly profane study of Racism in Modern Day America. But it's raw power, and visual poetry will leave you astounded, as a day in the life of a brother desperately trying to do what's right heads on into a stunning, emotional climax. Raw. Powerful.

","This movie is awesome for so many different reasons. Edward Norton(I know it's been said) is the GREATEST American actor to come along in a long, long time(I'll admit I'm not very familiar with foreign films, so I won't say greatest actor worldwide, but he's GOT to be one of the best.) He can play any role, from a Catholic priest, to a con man, to a Neo-Nazi, but I think this movie is clearly his most powerful performance. He plays a Neo-Nazi who just got out of jail and has seemingly changed, though we're not really sure what he was like before, though the tattoos in the flashback that opens the movie give us a pretty good idea. The rest of the movie is partial flashback, partial current as he confronts a world he renounced in prison for reasons unknown(until close to the end, but I won't spoil it because the reason has layers upon layers.) and now his former running buddies are wondering what happened to their leader. Furlong's performance was 2D to be sure, but that almost seemed to be what his character was crying out to be. This easily molded follower archetype, and overall he did very well. The supporting characters were all excellent, but of course the blue ribbon goes to Norton for playing two radical extremes in the same movie. This movie does something that most movies about a racial subject matter don't do: it DOES NOT preach. It shows a very gradual, very REAL transformation, not like some ray of light shines on him and suddenly he sees the error of his ways. It takes experience, hardships and incredible agony to even plant the seed of reform in his mind. This movie is very, very powerful and very, very real."

","The buzz about this movie (as best listed on the back of the VCR packaging) describes it as a movie about ""the consequences of racism"". I actually would have to say it goes a bit further than that. Certainly, the movie revolves around racism and ethnocentrism, but I believe that functions more as an accessible vehicle to explore what virulent, phobic HATRED creates for both an individual and his community.<br/><br/>I was living in the state of Alabama when this film came out, and it didn't play in many theatres in the local area. I always wondered if that was because the content was believed to be too strong for the populace. ""American History X"" can be too strong for certain viewers, largely because it's a serious, provocative film with little comic relief. It also brazenly depicts a life experience of antagonism and conflict that may bother viewers who live a more sheltered existence.<br/><br/>Norton's portrayal of his character is well done, playing both his hostile ""prior"" character in flashbacks and his at-first-inexplicable ""post"" persona with a convincing performance in both roles. Furlong's ""younger brother"" character is a little more two-dimensional, being depicted largely as a ""follower"" type, but that apparent weakness is necessary in order to give Norton's Derek the needed urgency to tell his story.<br/><br/>All in all, a cerebral ""what-if"" exercise in issues still confronting America today that should resonate with any thinking person."

","That one word pretty much sums up this tour-de-force drama, about reformed, recently paroled ex-skinhead Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton, who is amazing in his Oscar-nominated performance), his troubled life, his confrontation with his past, and his relationship with his younger brother Daniel (Edward Furlong, who is equally startling).  How a film with such stark subject matter like racism and intolerance can be made in this day and age and not seem over-the-top is incredible.  The main reason that I enjoyed this film is because even though the main characters are hateful, hate-filled people, you can't help but commiserate with them.  You can't help but feel sorry for them and the beliefs that they've espoused.  This movie depicts the reality of racial discrimination in modern America and the drastic and dire effects these viewpoints can have.  Also, irony and imagery are elements that, if used effectively enough, can teach others as well as make them think.  The irony: Derek went to jail for killing a Black man, befriended a Black man in jail named Lamont (Guy Torry), and soon after changed his xenophobic line of thinking.  The imagery: the B&W images represent Derek's bleak closemindedness as oppose to the color images, which symbolize his acceptance of 'color' in his life.  The conclusion, which is nothing short of mesmerizing, is a vivid reminder that violence and hate constantly revolve in a vicious cycle.  One of the most controversial and thought-provoking films in recent cinema, ""American History X"" is a film that everyone (racists and liberals alike) should view at least once.  A must-see.  ****"
"Joe-560","10","0","1","23 December 2002"," one of the best movies ever made
","American History X is a powerful, emotionally devastating opus of beauty that should be viewed and experienced by all. Tony Kaye and David McKenna have done something extroardinary in seeing hate and racism from the POV of the American neo-Nazi, and helped us see more than we could have hoped for. The film's underlying theme was simple: life is too short to be p****d off all the time. Edward Norton's dynamic performance was his best to date, showing a grand transformation of the intelligent yet simple-minded young man who, while in an emotionally hateful and racist frame of mind, speaks certain truths that most of us wish were not the facts. However, it is only after befriending a black inmate in prison that he learns see things from a wider perspective, through all the b******t and propaganda that he has learned and taught others. He realizes that yes, maybe it is true that one in every three black males is in some form of a correctional facility. Maybe most black Americans have been using their past history of slavery to promote white guilt and frighten white Americans into recession. But the even harder truth to face is that Norton's hate had so consumed him that he failed to see any options other than blaming blacks and minorities for all of the country's problems. Hate consumed his mind and disabled it. This is one of the best movies ever made and one of my favorites. I have been watching Norton since Primal Fear and I know that he will go far as an actor. It was a pity he did not win the Academy Award for Best Actor."

","Powerful is the best way to describe American History X.  It is one of those films that benefits greatly from its subject matter.  Few people encounter such overt racism in their everyday lives, and this film serves as an important reminder about the dangers of such beliefs.  In the past 5-10 years, America pulled itself out of its ""PC"" era which means anti-racist thinking is on the way out, only to be replaced by something more honest and instinctual (much better in my opinion).  When's the last time you heard the word ""prejudice?""  I never thought that would be a buzzword, but it is.<br/><br/>American History X serves to remind us of the pockets of anachronistic racism still living in the U.S.  How prevalent these beliefs used to be still amazes me, and film exhibits no exception.  Check out Spike Lee's Bamboozled for a shocking glimpse into that.  I'll also take this opportunity to say again how much I hate Gone With the Wind... a classic joke of overacting (not Gable) and inadvertent racism that I couldn't get past.  Films with double purpose of education and entertainment are few and far between.  Chalk another one up for Norton, this one's a keeper.  Prepare to be shocked. 10/10"

","Economical and social problems are regularly associated in some societies, normally developed ones, to the presence of certain minorities, emigrants and people not belonging to the same ethnic prevailing in the country. It happened in Germany where nazis wanted to justify their problems with the increased richness of Jewish population,  and this film touches the problem in the context of US, when young and nearly ignorant young people start admiring Hitler's  ideology. A young very racist guy is taken to the prison after he killed two black men, who wanted to steal his car. One of the black was killed in a most violent manner. He is put in jail and there learned that he was completely wrong. The film has a lot of charge until its end, but I may ask, why such an end? There is no need for a happy end, but perhaps for something more coherent with the ideas the director seems to defend. Sorry, but the epilogue to me is bias."
"Bogey Man","9","0","1","8 October 2002"," Powerful depiction of racism
","Tony Kaye's extremely impressive feature film directorial debut AMERICAN HISTORY X (1998) is a film one necessarily wouldn't expect to come from today's Hollywood too often. A strong and harrowing depiction of racism and rotten minds who feed it and keep it alive in ""civilized"" society. The film is written by David McKenna who has since written films like Blow.<br/><br/>Edward Norton and Edward Furlong play brothers in AMERICAN HISTORY X, a brothers who have been taught to support racism since they were just teenagers. Then their father gets killed in the line of duty and Derek, the older (Norton), decides it was all because of blacks and other non-white American people who live in their neighbourhood as well as in the whole America, too. He turns into real devil in the form of human being and starts a gang in their neighbourhood to destroy all the ""parasites, immigrants.."" and becomes hugely popular skinhead leader who is hugely admired by Danny, the younger brother (Furlong). Then a horrific act of violence takes place and things start to take new directions..<br/><br/>Rarely have I seen a film about racism made this restrainedly but still extremely harrowingly and memorably. The actors are of course great and Oscar worthy, but the screenplay is the most important thing. There's no humor or lightening elements and the ending is definitely not a traditionally happy and ""it was just a movie"" like. The ending is there to strike the viewers even more effectively and force us think and realize. Especially the last speech is important and thickens it all.<br/><br/>
Also the acts and ""opinions"" of the skinheads are written with care and the film doesn't moralize anything which is great. The skinheads really believe in their thing that all other than non-white/American citizens need to be killed, hurt or otherwise destroyed and removed. When I listen to them I cannot but admire the work of the scriptwriter; even the real skinheads should stop and think do they really want to look so pathetic and ridiculous because they ARE realistically depicted in this film.<br/><br/>The music is powerful and sad and makes the images even more powerful and stunning. Kaye is also a cinematographer in this film and it shows as he captures some nice landscapes and uses B&W photography very effectively. There are many extreme close ups of character heads and face expressions which really show how serious all the characters, racists and non-racists, are and I cannot find single one irritating or unnecessary role or actor in this film. The ending is unexpected and very sad. The violence in the ending is also very fierce but it is pretty much symbolic and makes the man who grabs the gun really see what has now been done by him and why. The film includes some very strong scenes of violence but they are never even distantly exploitative or gratuitous but realistic and thus so painful to watch. This is the kind of film which can make viewer turn the eyes off the screen at some points and that is a sign that the message has been delivered and will stay haunting inside the viewer mind and that is also one thing from which a remarkably powerful movie can be recognized.<br/><br/>Tony Kaye's film is easily among the greatest and most important Hollywood films of the 1990's. It can be seen universally and won't lose its power too easily during years and as long as this kind of wickedness takes place in the world everyday, these films remain as important as when they were released and should also be seen by many people who don't necessarily understand how serious these things really are not only in this film but in real world, too. Films like this are for everybody and concern everybody. 9/10"
"keeperman42","Null","0","1","29 September 2002"," Alright movie, but...
","American History X is a good movie, but towards the end it is highly propagated. I don't want to give too much away in regards to the storyline, but what happened in prison and after prison is very wrong.  White power/White supremacists/nazi's/etc. do not do drugs, deal drugs, or lean towards any form of homosexuality. Also, someone who has had the beleifs as long and as strong as Derek wouldn't be out of them so quickly.<br/><br/>With all that aside, I will say what I liked about the movie. The acting was superb.  A scene that sticks out in my mind is towards the end with Danny and the negro at the school.  Their emotions, reactions, etc. looked absolutely authentic and pure. The attention to detail was also great.  At the skinhead party, I noticed someone wear a Skrewdriver t-shirt.  Skrewdrier are a popular white power band.<br/><br/>In closing, I think you should watch this movie if you haven't already, but don't buy into the media interperatation of nazis/skinheads/etc."

This movie will send you away thinking. The only lacking parts are some of the other cast members delivering stale obviously over-rehearsed lines at times like the first dinner table scene. Overall it gives presence to both sides of Racism and leaves you the feeling that neither side is justified. Norton learns not to hate, and that rage is bad.

","I thought it was very good.  One of the things that makes it particularly good is that it presents racism as a continuum, not an either-you-are-or-you-arent-a-racist thing.  Derek's character is on different points on this continuum throughout the movie. When he says some things you can agree with and others you totally reject, it makes you look at yourself and say ""Where do I lie on this continuum?""<br/><br/>Downsides: Derek's transformation not explored as much as his initial skinhead point of view;  Elliot Gould (He *always* seems aware that he's acting);  kinda gruesome and certain images may bother you for some time after viewing.<br/><br/>Upsides: performances are fantastic (especially Norton's); Edward Furlong is not nearly as annoying as he was in Terminator2; Avery Brooks is great.<br/><br/>Essay question:  Can Derek's transformation last considering how the film ends, or does he revert?"
"jhambrock444","8","0","1","23 July 2002"," Emotionally Gripping Drama About Life and Family
","When we see someone we love become something we hate, it tears us apart. Such situations can destroy families, such situations can bring families together. In this film, one family is put under enormously serious situations in which how much they can endure will prove how strong they really are.<br/><br/>On a fateful summer night in California, Derrek Vinyard  (Edward Norton), hears the noise of glass shattering. He looks out the window to see a few men trying to break open his car. Although we do not know it, this series of events will labeled as a race crime. The men in our eyes are black. The men in Derrek's eyes are not men, they are creatures tearing apart our economy, our American foundation, and our neighborhood. In a violent and excessive way, Derrek defends his family. The end result is the death of 2 African American men.<br/><br/>Derrek is sentenced to 3 years in prison for Defensive Manslaughter. While it may seem that Derrek is the main focus of this story, the person most affected by this is his younger brother, Danny (Edward Furlong). Like almost any younger brother, Danny admires Derrek. Danny recognizes what Derrek did. Danny sees that nearly a hundred other people like his brother worshipped him. Danny is not blind. He sees that the impact Derrek had on their community was so astounding that it is only in Danny's responsibility to carry on that tradition.<br/><br/>In an amazing realistic and true-to-life story written by David McKenna, we watch and take in every event which happens in Derrek's life after that fateful night. We watch the transformation of characters, the metamorphosis of the Vinyard family over the course of 3 years, and even a few before that.<br/><br/>After seeing this film, you don't think about the pervasive violence and language, you don't think about the graphic content and often disturbing realism involved, you are left with a mindset which leaves you in a twist. You know some of these things that happen are wrong, but why do you agree with them in some points? What makes these characters tick? Why does this happen? When you ask yourself theses questions, you know you have seen a work of art.<br/><br/>Brilliantly and beautifully filmed and directed by Tony Kaye, he pulls us into this world which is so similar to what we live in today. We become so involved with the characters, that in the final act, we are left with a feeling of confusion and sorrow.<br/><br/>This film is surly to be labeled as controversial for all times, but should be more remembered for its message, especially in this time of our world."

Also Edward Furlong gives an unforgetable performance as does all the crew. The direction was perfect. I can't believe Shakespeare in Love took the Best Picture Award that year.  Really this is one of the best movies ever made, words can't describe it's greatness. I don't wanna get into spoilers, but I will recommend to everyone this film.  And BTW I read a lot of reviews complaining about the fast change of Norton in the movie. Well that's the best part of the movie. I mean come on people this is no a bullsh*t movie to last hours and get boring. And I would like to mention one more thing. The speech at the dinner is one of the best scenes in motion picture.

The performances alone make the film worth watching, throw in some beautiful camera work (the shower scene), great direction and an incredible script and you have all the elements of a classic.<br/><br/>Coming from a person who doesn't take the subject of racial divide lightly, I believe this film is the most influential racial film of recent history.

"erbgorK","10","0","1","13 July 2002"," Brilliant
","This is one of the best movies I have ever seen...it is rare that racism is ""realistically"" portrayed in a movie, especially in a hollywood movie. When I heard of this movie, I expected the mindless bashing of Nazis. While I personally consider it plain wrong, I feared this movie just would not go deep enough, and I would forget the next day. But I was wrong, I think I will always remember this movie when I discuss the topic, and believe me, when you are german like me, you discuss it a lot. The story itself is very simple; An american neo nazi rises to the top of the local gang. His brother admires him and follows his footsteps, but when the older brother goes too jail for killing two black men, he sees and experiences things that change his mind, and when he comes out he tries to save his brother. The story is fairly standard...just the way the story is presented makes the movie exceptional. Furlong and especially Norton give outstanding performances, and all the other characters are very well portrayed. And I do not agree with some reviewers who say the 180 deegree change of Derek is unreallistic...I hope and I actually BELIEVE that a person can change, see their own mistakes, through open minded thinking. There is now wrong philosophy, but following without thinking is wrong (my opinion, but I feel this is what the movie is trying to say too). I say you have too see the movie. Chances are you will not like it. You might hate it. But the chance that it gives you inspiration to think about a very grim and never to be forgotten part of human (not german, american, HUMAN) history are enough to justify spending two hours of your life on it."

"PrinceMishkin","6","0","2","27 March 1999"," A daring subject, with fine acting, but ultimately botched.
","In the early 1980's it was regarded as a great novelty when the man behind the Hovis commercial directed a hit film. At the time the two worlds were still regarded as miles apart; once one took the soup from Kleenex or Curly Wurly, one was cursed to walk their earth for eternity, with no hope of escape. Ridley Scott broke that mould, with the help of Hugh Hudson, Alan Parker and his brother Tony. More recently, they have been joined by video directors like David Fincher. All share a common visual vocabulary; whilst many have made effective films, there is a cold polish to their work, a discipline of image over content which has often been counterproductive.<br/><br/>American History X, whilst in many ways an admirable film, is a case in point. Tony Kaye is a highly respected director of both commercials and videos - the British Rail advertisement with the snoozing sepia people is his - and it shows. Fish eye lenses, tasteful monochrome, slow motion, faces in deep shadow, all are used and often used effectively. However one is constantly waiting for a silky voice to try and sell us perfume. Since Kaye is his own director of photography, all responsibility for this lies with him.<br/><br/>The film tells the story of two brothers involved with Neo-Nazi skinheads in the Venice Beach area of Los Angeles. Derek (Edward Norton), has just been released from prison after serving time for killing a black man. Danny (Edward Furlong), idolises his elder brother and has followed in his footsteps, his room bedecked with Nazi regalia. This is a very sensitive theme and it is extremely well played by the two Edwards. Norton's Oscar nomination is well deserved, but Furlong is no less impressive, he manages to convey the avalanche of confusion that engulfs a teenager. His racism is part of a pack mentality, one sees clearly that freed from the malign forces around him, he could escape and the humanity in him could blossom.<br/><br/>The film dares to make both brothers attractive personalities, it dares to allow us to root for them. Elsewhere, the filmmakers are not so brave. On the side of righteousness there is Sweeney, a black school principal with ""two PhD's"", who goes out of his way to assist both Derek and Danny. This really is far too schematic, that the Nazis see the error of their ways because of a saint is much too easy. If there were a Sweeney in every high school, then the problem could  be solved over night. Similarly if all right wing leaders were as transparently evil as Stacy Keach's Cameron, then the Dannys of the world would be fairly safe from their grasp. Keach plays him as a cackling maniac, complete with scary scar; he belongs in an underwater base, cradling a white cat. As the electoral success of people like former KKK member David Dukes has shown, white supremacists are capable of appearing just as suburban and normal as Tony Blair. It is there that the real danger lies for America, not with demagogic caricatures.<br/><br/>The process of Derek's political development is also rather cheesy. His dad warned him about affirmative action so he became suspicious of Sweeney's liberalism, his dad gets murdered by a drug dealer so he becomes a Nazi, he goes to prison and meets a nice black bloke, sees the error of his ways and changes his mind. This is the sort of clunky emotional exposition that used to define the character arcs of guest stars in Little House on the Prairie. Similarly, the many intriguing moral and political issues are not demonstrated dramatically, but are explicitly discussed in a series of set pieces over dinner. This is a shame since most of the time writer David McKenna delivers a very controlled and well structured piece of work. He avoids a neat narrative line and moves comfortably backwards and forwards through time.<br/><br/>There is also a very sure sense of place, the Venice Beach locations lend the film an enigmatic feel. This is an environment which straddles race and class. Unlike the urban jungles of the industrial cities of the East, Venice has great natural beauty, the Pacific opens and closes the film. Yet man makes his own ugliness, the meanness of the human spirit is everywhere. There are very few American films which have so convincingly created such a dark nether world, otherwise ignored by mainstream media.<br/><br/>And yet, Hollywood sensibilities do permeate the picture. In the end all it takes for Derek to convince Danny of the error of his ways is for him to tell him about the nice black bloke in prison; a sequence that is both schematic and dramatically moribund. This sums up so much of what is frustrating about the film, it is skilfully made but has little flavour of original talent, it is brave but not brave enough to matter."

However,the film's greatest draw must be the astonishing Edward Norton,disgracefully passed over at the Oscars, who turns in a remarkable performance as Neo-Nazi hate-monger Derek Vinyard.Norton transforms the film from a good rent to an essential view,seamlessly portraying his almost duel-performance of Vinyard before and after his reform from racial hated,entirely convincingly.The film is far more than a stream of shocking (and they are shocking) set-pieces, and the violence, brutal as it may be,is never glamourised.The film's harrowing conclusion is the icing on the cake, ensuring that this is a tale that will stay with you long after the video is back in the box.All in all, a very good movie, if not one for the faint of heart!"

","The most interesting aspect of this film is the slip the filmmakers make at the end.  In trying to bring the story full circle they show a flashback where the character played by Norton is given advice by his father.  This is where they were trying to show how people learn prejudice from their parents (which is true to some extent, but not as prevalent as some would have us believe--many people actually become prejudice because of life experiences). The problem is that other than the injected racial slur, the father's advice is RIGHT ON TARGET!  Think for yourself, read a book but make up your own mind about it.  Don't let a teacher, book, media, whatever tell you what is absolute truth, take them all in and then see what passes the common sense test.  Just because a book is from a liberal slant (as the one discussed in the film is) doesn't mean it is not flawed, didactic and propaganda also."

","A mate of mine suggested this film to me, and I found it to be the most thought provoking film I have seen in many years. This film challenges the viewer from beginning to end.<br/><br/>This film is so important. It takes a very serious subject - rascism, Neo Nazi beliefs - and dissects and analyzes the effects it has on the a) Protaganists. b) Victims. c) Societies. <br/><br/>Edward Norton, still relatively unknown when he made this film, gives a gritty, realistic, and overwhelming performance as Derek Vinyard. His transformation from hate fuelled Neo Nazi to understanding rehabilitated young man, deserved an Oscar. That's how good he is! He is electric.<br/><br/>This film also features the most shocking piece of cinema I have ever witnessed! The scene where Derek executes a burglar, who also happens to be black. There has been much controversy over the inclusion of this scene in the finished film, and it's a good thing that this scene was allowed in because we need to see this scene to see how violent, and brutal Derek was before his transformation. We needed to see that scene to show us the way in which he felt about black people. Derek was a creation. He was a product. Of a man who believed that black people are worthless. What's more frightening is that this man, was a product of another man's beliefs and hate, and so it goes. Who do we blame? Is there any Blame? This is the film's ultimate question.<br/><br/>Edward Furlong gives a very good performance as Derek's younger brother. He too is being corrupted, just like Derek had been, and this brainwashing is what the film highlights most.<br/><br/>The film is not one I can review lightly, it's a very serious film, and deserves the highest respect. I do not want to say anything that may offend anyone. With a film like this you have to be careful how you phrase things.<br/><br/>Overall, a great film, strong performances, intelligent script and a real eye opener to anyone who watches it.

","This is a very impressive movie. I think it gives a fairly realistic view into the world and ideas of ""white power"" and neo-nazism, although it's true that you could also get that view from watching a documentary on the Discovery Channel. However, this movie also succeeds very well at showing how nonsensical and futile those ideas are, and makes a very strong statement against racism. <br/><br/>Furthermore, the acting in this movie is really top-class, and the movie is shot in a way that makes everything look very realistic, right down to the blood and gore. Also, this movie has a remarkable ending compared to most Hollywood movies that always have an extremely happy end.<br/><br/>
The only complaint I have about this movie is that Edward Norton's character's move away from neo-nazism while he was in prison happened a bit too sudden: no real insight into his motives way given. This is a minor complaint however, which doesn't stop me from giving this movie ***1/2 out of **** stars"

What the hell could I have been doing that was more important than watching the fantastic Edward Norton in the most astonishing role of his entire career...?<br/><br/>*******WARNING: SPOILERS!*********<br/><br/>The way that the entire film is based mainly on Norton's character's flash backs of his time in prison builds the tension and suspense even more. Why has he changed his beliefs? How did he change as a person? What really happened in prison? Instead of just taking us through him getting sent to prison and showing us what happened, we are told the story through Derek and Danny together.<br/><br/>While I had heard how powerful this film was for years, what I had heard most about was 'the bit where he kicks the guys head against the curb.' And so I watched it - not just for that, but because it was a film I HAD to see. I literally winced at that part - just the sound of it is enough!<br/><br/>Only ever seeing Edward Furlong in 'Terminator 2' and hearing that he had since then become a junkie, I was pleasantly surprised by his perfomance in this film. The young anti-black rebel following in his older brother's footsteps is a role I never thought I would see him in.<br/><br/>I don't think I even need to praise Edward Norton, but I will anyway. He was obviously dedicated to this role - gaing 30lbs in muscle and shaving his head to play a part in a film shows determination, which just adds to his outstanding and powerful performance. Having only just seen him in 'Fight Club' it was unreal to see him stray from a funny, wimpy part to one such as this. I don't know if he won any awards for this film, but if he didn't, then I would just have to say that those voters really are delusional if they don't recognise a fantastic actor when they see one."

","A movie that stands out not only for it's fantastic cast and beautiful camera work, but also for it's bold statements about modern society. American History X is one of the most powerful and in your face movies I have ever seen.  The movie will lead you through a maze of emotions as you watch.  You will cry, you will become angry, and you will laugh (not much, though).  I enjoyed this movie very much, mainly because it shows the struggle of a reformed racist fighting to save his brother from the ignorance of nazism and racism.  The way the movie is filmed and written, mostly in a flashback (all of which is filmed in black and white) makes it easy to follow the story.  It is well written and the movie flows exceptionally well.  The movie is as brutally honest as it is brutally violent.  The violence shown is enough to startle and shock almost anyone, but all of the violence is done in good taste.  If you are interested in reality-based movies that aren't afraid to show you what is going on in society, then this is the movie for you.  Also recommended is Romper Stomper with Russell Crowe."

","Stellar.  I was shocked at the end of the movie.  After such a reformation, how can one adapt to such a tragedy when you've come so far in your crusade for racial tolerance?  I don't care what people say.  This wasn't a ""change of heart"" for a racist caucasian.  This was a testament to the racist component in all of us.  I came to college your typical white-collared Irish-Scottish-Swedish what have you, and having lived with a Jamaican for a year it changed my life.  And that's what this movie is about.  How over a short period of time a true understanding of another person's race can enhance you forever.  Edward Norton is outstanding as ever.  We were astounded by his presence in Primal Fear, entertained by his performance in Rounders and Fight Club, but I was intrigued and compelled to tolerance and compassion by his performance in American History X.  The hatred of so many is fueled by passion with little justification.  We live in a country where a small incident involving two racial factions becomes an all-out hate fest. How people can so immediately draw that dividing line over something non-cosmic between two parties whom we've never known.  And we can take a side instantaneously.  The transition of Edward Norton in this movie was plausible and realistic.  You CAN change a person in three years.  It's only so true, as evident in the movie, how backstabbing an all-white organization can be.  This could be said of any organization so homogenous.  When one member defects he is an invalid and despised.  How amazing it is in the movie how tolerant the black population is of him when he forsakes his hateful methods.  How amazing is this movie at showing the pure contempt and miraculous epiphany.  How defeating when everything Norton's character has strived for with his family is crushed the moment things start to turn around for him.  See this movie.  It will stun you, if you've ever wanted to eradicate that last racist component in you."

","I saw the movie Fight Club and though it was not as dramatic and meaningful as American History X, Edward Norton gave a great performance. American History X left me in a state of shock after my first time watching it. It made me realize what a sick world we live in where some people cannot live their lives to what they want because of what they look like or where they are from. Edward Norton did a great job of playing from two different aspects of the same character. One was the Nazi racist Derek who was prejudice about almost everyone that wasn't like him, And one was the changed Derek who realized the mistakes he had made. The end surprised me though you had a feeling that something bad was coming. Now I would recommend this movie to anyone age 15 and up. Anyone who is not 15 or above should only watch this movie if you can handle the graphic nature."
"raymond_chandler","9","0","1","29 July 2001"," ""Has anything you've done made your life better?""
","I will always regret not seeing this for the first time in a theatre. Even on video, the impact is staggering. Certain scenes, notably the two discussions at the dinner table ('Rodney King' and 'Native Son'), Derek's confrontation with Cameron at the party, and, for me, Derek's memories of himself and Danny at the seashore, are classic examples of what intelligent movie-making can be. The violence in this film is totally in the context of the story, and therefore all the more shocking for it. These are characters we grow to know and like, and their motivations are those of real people. This kind of film, which tackles tough, meaningful issues in the lives of everyday people, is all too rare these days. Derek's speeches as a skinhead illustrate why this is not a simple problem to resolve, but the film itself resoundingly discredits violence as a solution.<br/><br/> Edward Norton will never deliver a finer-crafted, more-nuanced performance. Some of his roles have been showy (""Primal Fear"", ""The Score""), but here he creates a fully-realized, immensely complex person. Derek Vinyard is an archetypal character in cinema, and Norton's portrayal will be talked about for many years to come. But the rest of the cast is superb as well. Stacy Keach underplays Cameron beautifully, making him frighteningly ordinary, instead of a nutcase. Guy Torry is so likable as Lamont that he makes Derek's transformation believable. Avery Brooks, Beverly D'Angelo, and Jennifer Lien give dignity and depth to what could have been throwaway roles. Even Edward Furlong, normally an actor I find annoying, elevates his game here - check out the scenes with his little sister and when he is just starting to write his paper. I have seen this movie many times now, and I really believe each time that these people are Derek's family.<br/><br/>
 The structure of the film is one of its greatest strengths. The contrast between Derek now and Derek then is so stark that we are compelled to find out what changed him. On repeated viewings, you can see that he is the same person - charismatic, no-nonsense, passionate - but the older Derek has let go of his hate. The use of black-and-white makes it easy to follow the sequence of events, even though the flashback scenes are not presented chronologically. Every scene, every line adds to the overall effect. This is a landmark film, no doubt about it."

There's lots of brutality and violence.  And lots of excellent directing.  Flashbacks are in black and white.  There are good uses of slow motion and cuts.  But not every performance was as stellar as Norton's, and there was way too much psycho-babble instead of some thought-provoking scenes.

","When I finished watching American History X the first time I sat for a full 10 minutes before I could say anything. It is an amazing film, meant for a mature audience. However, I plan on watching it with my Son when he is confronted with racial issues. I feel it is an important film for him to watch, because it goes far to explain why kids join neo-nazi hate groups and it does an outstanding job of showing why the beliefs of those hate groups are wrong. Hate is a delicate subject and American History X is able to balance our disgust with our quest for answers to the eternal ""Why?"" question.<br/><br/>Edward Norton is amazing in this movie. I am glad he was nominated for his performance, because he deserved at least that much. His ability to transform his look and demeanor from scene to scene is about the best I have ever seen.

Every person (black, white, whatever) knows someone of another race that they don't like, maybe there's a bunch of people from that race that they don't like, and they tell themselves that they're not racist.  It's most likely true that you are not.

"tommyboy-16","8","0","1","15 January 2001"," the real treasure of hatred
","I gave this movie a solid 8 and it came real close to sliding into a 9 spot. The violence and language is not for the tender. The brutality of the body and spirit is necessary for the story line. The movie would lose its gut impact without it. Gut impact is a good word for the feeling this movie renders.<br/><br/>This film is not center staging violence nor does it take the easy road with quick glimpses of passionate sex. The star is an emotion. It has survived since the beginning of time. Sometimes it appears to be the only thing that lasts. This emotion is hatred. We watch as a family unravels before our eyes because of hatred then tries to mend itself by changing course.<br/><br/>The movie does a real good job of showing both sides of the tracks. It covers some real tough social and economic problems that are too often and incorrectly tagged to a certain group. Derek, the skinhead, does have some real true issues and is a hurting being, like many other humans in this world. He is a section of society that feels left out and left behind and becomes angry about it.  He makes some good points and some obnoxious points. He falls into a pit that all bigots descend into by concluding that society's problems would be eliminated with certain groups being exterminated and or severely controlled. The story is not totally one sided as many times it's simply survival of the strong. It's kind of like living on the grasslands of Africa where there are predators and prey. In this case blacks and whites prey on each other as well as being a cannibalistic beast so to speak. Sometimes they are living in fear and are just trying to survive. When you deal with hatred one can't dance with the devil without getting a little stain on one's dress. In the case of Derek's family the stain runs deep. We all may be quick to judge one of these groups, but we never know what our reactions would be unless we have been in their shoes and had to survive.<br/><br/>Edward Norton plays Derek perfectly. I have never seen an actor look like a mean and nasty neo-nazi skinhead one-minute and then a pencil pushing office room geek the next. The change was due to Derek's epiphany he had in prison and the help of a good-natured high school teacher. While in prison, Derek learned what brutality is and that skin color or a matching tattoo does not guarantee loyalty and sincerity. He found that skin color is only a difference and should not be a  guidance system to hate. He realizes the bigger picture and then discovers guilt. He learns life is too short. He must carry his guilt that only becomes a bigger burden once freedom rings.<br/><br/>This movie is a very good movie and portrays hatred as purely evil and rightly so. In this movie it's not all whitey or blackie's fault. I applaud the movie for that. Sometimes a movie similar to this makes blacks look all bad or that all whites hate everyone different from themselves. In this movie both groups are brutalized and each ones actions, while being a horrible injustice, may be more understandable if we lived in their world. There would have been a few things I would have done differently in this movie as a director, but not much. My score of 8 is a score that I do not give out very often. I would not recommend this movie to everyone and especially young kids who are easily impressionable. I know many feel this movie reveals only  the evil side but a person, that relates to one of these groups, might concentrate or only feel the raw power in the violence and find it mesmerizing. Not a movie for everyone!"

This film tells the story of how Derek came to reform while spending time in prison for the murders of two black men who were trying to steal his car.

But the best thing about this film is the breathtaking performance by Edward Norton, as an ex-neonazi who gets out of jail and tries to stop his younger brother (very well portrayed by Edward Furlong) from imitating him.

This is a beautifully photographed and wonderfully written movie that takes a very strong subject, and forms it all into a truly unique film. Norton is amazing - He has such as tremendous range as an actor that it so difficult that he also played a neurotic New Yorker in Woody Allen's Everyone Says I Love You.  His buffed-up physique, shaved head, and goatee all make him look incredibly realistic as a Los Angeles skinhead (and worried some that skinheads would become chic).  His performance is incredible, as are the standout supporting performances from Avery Brooks as the black teacher who believes in both Derek and Danny, and Stacy Keach (who seems determined to break his image as Mike Hammer) as the head white supremacist in town.  First-time feature director Tony Kaye (who also served as cinematographer) directs and photographs this film beautifully, and Anne Dudley's score is one to remember.

","I was immediately struck by the power of this film, the violent images, the great performance by Edward Norton that just oozes hate. But as the rhetoric of anger and racism built up in the film, I became so uncomfortable I could not continue to watch it. So, this is not a true movie review. I did fast forward to scenes I could handle and the very gruesome ending.<br/><br/>This is a very effective portrait of the skin head gang world. The process of how a person can change is also pretty well done considering that 3 years of prison time is compressed to a few scenes. Norton's acting is terrific in showing that transition. Also, the confusion and suffering of the Norton character's family is powerful. Avery Brooks' role is briefly allowed to be a sincere but pretty ineffective counter balance to all of the hate. With the exception of him and another African American in prison, all the African Americans in the film are grim and threatening. <br/><br/>And this brings up a huge contradiction in the movie. The African American high school students shown are out of control and no one is really trying to stop them. But, the fact that there are a lot of African Americans in prison is clearly supported in the movie. Meaning, cops do pay attention to them and arrest them. American History X can't have it both ways. To reflect that reality there should have been a lot more police involvement with the young African American gang members. <br/><br/>In a way American History X is an example of what it is trying to criticize. It stereotypes most young African Americans as mindless thugs, giving no solution to the gang problem partly justifying the hate that it supposedly is against."

Some scenes are impossible to watch but overall the movie sends a positive message.  Several of the supporting actors are also great. I am glad I saw this movie but I couldn't watch it again.  It amazes me that fellow reviewers have said they 'love' this movie.  That's like saying you 'love' a disease or a war."
"Reel07","6","0","3","5 July 1999"," Overdone realism
","American History X is a good movie, not a great one. Neither does it make this year's best films, in my opinion. The story is about a former skinhead (played superbly by Edward Norton, who is going to hit it big) who is sent to jail for an intolerable crime. He then ""changes"" (I don't know how, but I can tell you that the film didn't show that, and if it did, then not enough) and comes out of jail, only to come home to his younger brother who seems to have been influenced by him and the story moves on about how the character tries to change his brother's views. As realistic and frightening as the film is, it goes overboard with torture and suffering. There are many scenes which could have been trimmed, including the brutal food market invasion of the skinheads, and an unwatchable prison rape scene. The camera angles are poor, with too many closeups at times. It is a beginning achievment, but I felt discouraged because the topic and story should have been given to a masterful director, like Scorsese, and all the brutality would have been shown in a more absorbing and watchable way. Nevertheless, there are great moments, and great performances. Edward Norton deserved a nomination, but not the oscar."

","I have heard people laud this film for it's writing, it's directing, and it's casting. It's directing was fair at best, and it's writing was poor. Only the decisions to cast Norton and Furlong for the two leading roles were good. This movie suffers from organizational problems i.e. jumping from year to year like hopscotch, spending an extremely short amount of time on important scenes and vice versa, etc. Aside from the fact that it was interesting, the film was overdone and sophomoric. Only Norton's performance deserves any praise."
"Jaime N. Christley","Null","0","2","8 April 1999"," Norton excellent; movie so-so
","A film is didactic when it contains scenes which have no other purpose, or no place in reality, other than to convey a public service message (""Racism is bad"").  ""American History X"" contains more than one scene like that. Also, the movie is very predictable.  If you are paying attention, you will be telegraphed the movie's climax a half hour out.  It was as if the director, Tony Kaye, had no way to tie the film up in an orderly fashion (I can sympathize:  I wouldn't know either, given that story), and decided, ""Okay, we'll do Greek tragedy.""<br/><br/>Apart from these flaws, the film comes through, due to a strong performance by Edward Norton in the lead.  His Academy Award nomination was much-deserved, and I'm certain he has the potential to give us many years of powerful, memorable performances.  Also, the black and white photography (also by the director) was a real treat, given how rarely we see it these days."
