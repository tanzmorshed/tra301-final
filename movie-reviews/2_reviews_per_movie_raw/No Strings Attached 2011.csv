","Romantic comedies need a good kick in the pants, and an aging Ivan Reitman ain't the guy to do it. ""No Strings Attached,"" the first of at least three 2011 films about non-committal sex (with ""Friends with Benefits"" and ""Hall Pass"" in hot pursuit), is only sparsely amusing and never insightful. Big surprise. Who would have guessed that a 64-year-old director would be the wrong choice for a movie about hip people half his age? ""No Strings Attached"" might have been a decent film had it followed through on its premise, but that it falls victim to just about every romcom trapping negates the most potentially interesting thing it has going for it.<br/><br/>Everyone involved has proved themselves elsewhere. Reitman directed legendary '80s comedies ""Stripes"" and ""Ghostbusters"" before churning out a string of stinkers, including ""My Super Ex Girlfriend"" in 2006. Stars Natalie Portman (Emma) and Ashton Kutcher (Adam) are similarly defenseless against the lousy script. For my money, Portman still put on the best performance of 2010 in ""Black Swan,"" and by comparison her turn here is particularly disappointing. Kutcher is the weakest link, but has consistently proved he can hold his own in otherwise lame duck comedies like ""Valentine's Day.""<br/><br/>But between the bad direction, worse script, and lazy performances, ""No Strings Attached"" is a triple threat. Its worst blunder is that Emma and Adam's relationship is unbelievable, and their chemistry is nonexistent. Fledgling screenwriter Elizabeth Meriwether posits a female lead that flip-flops her stance on monogamy every two scenes, and Portman doesn't even attempt to sell it. Emma comes off pragmatic one minute and off her rocker the next. It makes less sense still given that her relationship with Adam isn't anything special to begin with. The B- romance between Greta Gerwig and Jake M. Johnson, friends of our principle couple, is actually markedly more naturalistic and compelling. It's a shame they're on screen so infrequently.<br/><br/>Meriwether's script is also criminally overlong. Two-hour comedies need to die a slow and painful death; there's just no reason ""No Strings Attached"" should exceed the 100-minute mark. What's worse, the audience has little expectation for when the film will end. More than once, a picturesque finale will align only for Emma to inexplicably get cold feet. Or Adam's father to take ill. The bait and tease might work if the better-late-than-never conclusion defied expectation, but in all likelihood you already know exactly how it will end. The biggest surprise is how much melodramatic filler we have to wade through on the way.<br/><br/>""No Strings Attached,"" like last year's mediocre ""Love and Other Drugs"" articulates the pressing need for innovation in Hollywood's romantic comedies. Depicting a relationship built on causal sex isn't especially progressive, and Ivan Reitman isn't one of the directors I'm especially interested in seeing discuss sexuality. Then again, he barely clears his throat on the subject; for a film about sex, ""No Strings Attached"" is pretty much sterile despite its R rating. Intellectually, the film is a solid PG-13. Our characters generally don't behave with the nuance expected of two 30-year-olds, and Meriwether relies on decrepit genre archetypes rather than cause and effect to progress the plot.<br/><br/>All told, Reitman's latest is unworthy of recommendation despite falling short of being an outright waste of time. It does feature a few genuinely funny moments that help excuse its crippling formula, but it never asserts itself or challenges the classic romantic comedy blueprint as much as its premise might indicate. Reitman deserves a kick in the pants every bit as much as the genre."
"secondtake","4","25","32","14 March 2013"," A weak, weak light comedy with a wasted Portman in the lead role
","No Strings Attached (2011)<br/><br/>You expect more than you're going to get here. There are two strong leads, Natalie Portman at her finest relaxed self (seeming) and Ashton Kutcher in a slightly amusing, self-deprecating mode that is a little dulling but fits his part. But there isn't the necessary conflict here to make their attraction take on fire. They drift together, they push apart, they find each other again, and so on, all mildly engaging and a bit sleepy.<br/><br/>And don't expect much from Kevin Kline, either, mostly because his part is small and a bit canned, a caricature dad with too much to prove. The rest of the cast is frankly just functional, and you start to look harder at why the movie fizzles with so much apparent talent, especially Portman. And the only real answer is the director, who is more a producer at heart, Ivan Reitman. You can't fault the success of some of his movies, but it's an uneven bunch, from ""Ghostbusters"" to ""Kindergarden Cop."" Something lacks energy and imagination here, and the writing stretched a bit. <br/><br/>Enjoyable? Somewhat. Be warned, it's not funny, romantic, or energized enough to quite make it on any score."
"ctomkin","3","63","92","22 January 2011"," A romantic comedy that is neither
","How about this for a unique movie premise: Boy and girl accidentally get reunited after several years, decide to skip all the work that goes into a relationship and settle for a strictly sexual one. They end up falling for each other, tempers flare, and break up. Moderately dramatic event occurs that brings them back together again. It may sound like the outline of every Matthew McConaughey film, and now it's also the recycled theme of No Strings Attached.<br/><br/>Adam (Ashton Kutcher) is some unspecified assistant on a television show, whose father (Kevin Kline, in what surely is one of his more forgettable roles) happens to be an extremely famous actor. He's also completely irresponsible and hedonistic, and somehow we're supposed to believe that he'd even bother to get a doctor's note so he could buy medical marijuana. Adam finds out that dad is now dating his bimbo ex-girlfriend. Distraught over this, Adam goes on a drinking binge that ends up reuniting him with Emma (Natalie Portman), a gifted doctor in residency in a teaching hospital. They end up in a strictly sexual relationship, and you'll figure out exactly how things are going to play out before the wacky sex location montage scene has finished. Emma is fine with this arrangement as she doesn't want to get too close to anyone. Adam wants more. The falling out is inevitable, as is the reunion (spoiler alert, everything works out just fine!).<br/><br/>This film follows the rom-com playbook to the letter. Emma of course has several roommates, one of which is the required effeminate overweight gay guy. Token black guy? That role is played by Ludicrous, the friend of Adam that shows up occasionally to give the standard bro ""you should be banging her"" advise. And of course the other women in Adam's life are either extremely socially awkward, or lesbians. Despite taking place in Los Angeles, you'd think it was more like a small town in Iowa the way everyone bumps into each other at the coffee shop or just walking down the street.<br/><br/>The jokes tend to fall flat, with the funniest scene involving Adam showing up at Emma's apartment with a menstruation mix CD (i.e. Sunday Bloody Sunday, other blood related songs) to entertain her and her fellow suffering roommates, one of who remarks that her underwear resembles a crime scene. I should point out that this film was directed by Ivan Reitman who also directed The Ghostbusters. What made him read this screenplay and decide that he must make this film? Every scene goes on just a little too long, and some of them don't make any sense. Example: when Adam gestures to Lucy, the awkward assistant director of the show he works on to sit down, she looks at the chair and says ""oh look, a chair"", pauses and then sits down. What was the point of that? Ed Wood films had better editing that this. None of the characters are remotely likable and most are barely more than ugly stereotypes.<br/><br/>Unless you really need to hear some jokes about Ashton Kutcher's penis, pass on this one. This movie will be in the five dollar bin at Wal-Mart in six months. And at that price, you'd still be better off with a random McConaughey rom-com instead."
"illbebackreviews","1","11","13","22 January 2013"," GREAT SCOTT! What a crap movie
","I do not know why on Earth I ended up watching this pile of garbage or whatever it is, things were not easy. For 90 minutes, I was staring at a screen watching a movie that never made me laugh or enjoy anything about the story, whether its the characters or whether its the script.<br/><br/>The acting in the film is okay. I guess Natalie Portman was good in the movie although at times, she tries too hard to be who she was in Black Swan. Ashton Kutcher was alright in the movie. None of the acting took me by surprise so that was already not a good sign about the movie.<br/><br/>The characters in this movie are just so dull and so annoying. Ashton's character is a guy going after Emma for sex, not because he loves her, but for sex. Now that's just annoying. Emma is perhaps the only decent character in the movie but her emotions towards Kutcher's character continuously changes during the movie to the point its just irritating especially by the end, when she's all crying.<br/><br/>Now the biggest issue with the movie is that its being done over and over again. FOR HECK SAKES, there was another movie based on the same story in the SAME GODDMAN YEAR called 'Friends with Benefits' Remember that? What were these people thinking? It was also done by the romance classic 'When Harry met Sally' Now, I could accept the fact that the characters are dull and the story isn't interesting if the script was at least funny. This film tries too hard to be a funny movie. It really sucks.<br/><br/>For those people who've wanted to see this movie, DO NOT! IT SUCKS!"
"OompaLoompa8816","8","108","168","24 January 2011"," Cute!
","I gave this movie an 8/10 simply because it will keep you laughing the majority of the time. Sure the ending is predictable and a few of the background actors deliver lackluster performances but Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher fit very nicely together as the main characters, you could really tell they had fun working together.<br/><br/>I see a lot of other reviews criticizing Portman for ""stooping to this level"" and I'm not too sure why, maybe they didn't go see it in the right frame of mind...this movie is what it is, a romantic comedy about two friends who decide to take their relationship to the next level without having any of the commitments and ""duties"" of being an actual couple, that's what the trailers showed it as, that's what the actors described it as, nothing was a surprise...she did a cute, funny romantic comedy, it's not like she dove head first into the adult film industry.<br/><br/>Will this movie be nominated for awards, probably, will it win, probably not, but overall it was cute, it was funny, and I left the theater feeling like the $10 I paid for a ticket was well worth it."

","Decent acting, sure. But the core, dialog and development offers very little to anyone older than 16.<br/><br/>The movie has one or two memorable moments. The rest was just bubble gum.<br/><br/>Given the outset, adding any delightful, surprising, thought provoking or interesting situations would be hard, but very possible. Though I obviously didn't watch this movie for depth, but when the brain is missing I do expect the heart to be compensated. This movie just simply failed to deliver.<br/><br/>If asked I wouldn't be able to pinpoint any particular reason to recommend this movie."

","I could barely get into the movie, let alone sit through it because I had a hard time buying Natalie Portman as the character she was playing. She's such an annoying over-achiever (and people rag on Kate Winslet for doing too much). Ashton Kutcher on his own was his usual self, not trying to out-act anyone or gun for an Oscar or anything. That coupled with the fact that this film seemed very similar to another terrible film I saw recently 'The Ugly Truth' starring Katherine Heigl and Gerald Butler. It's like we've run out of ideas and we're just coasting on the past ideas of others hoping something hits and works for the next set of coasters to come along and rehash our own copied ideas. The scary part is that this film was a hit people, so you can expect more like it coming to a theater near you sooner than you think. That said, I think Katherine Heigl should have played this role instead of Natalie Portman."

","What's Ludicrous doing in this movie. I think maybe it's because this movie has to have that one token black guy who hangs around yuppies all day. What were the producers thinking. Ya, throw Luda in there. That'll make it believable. I have yet to see something where he shows at least a shred of acting ability. If you thought he was bad in this, you should have seen him host SNL. Plus I don't know what's up with Natalie Portman. She is actually an alright actor but she doesn't seem believable at all. I don't know about her breaking out a tennis racket on those bitches or what about the part where she's screaming or jumping on Ashton when she's upset at him. This chick just can't do comedy. She's safe doing dramas. I didn't laugh once at this film. SO PREDICTABLE. Even the one-liners. The lil wayne references, the whole ""this is your fault that I'm pregnant!"" The first girlfriend was too dumb to even be alive. I've noticed that there where a lot of F bombs in this movie. I think that's the new recipe. Throw some F bombs in there, it'll make the jokes a little more funny. This movie was crap. I'm just glad I didn't have to pay to see this since it's on Netflix."

","Natalie Portman comes out of award season on top with her numerous Best Actress Awards for her performance in ""Black Swan"" including the Critic's Choice Award, the Golden Globe Award and an Oscar in the near future. Now she takes on the romantic comedy genre for the first time since her 2004 hit ""Garden State"". Her costar Ashton Kutcher on the other hand is no stranger to the romantic comedy genre with most of his recent films falling into this genre (""Killers"", ""Valentine's Day"", and ""What Happens In Vegas""). Together they create comedy through the awkwardly realistic chemistry between their characters Emma and Adam. Their quirky relationship begins when they are both sexually frustrated teenagers at summer camp. This leads them to becoming acquaintances throughout the early years of their relationship until they are thrown into each other's lives for the last time. Emma is a successful doctor who works eighty hours a week and is not looking for a relationship, while Adam is an aspired writer looking for a break working at a ""gleeish"" television show. Their latest encounter leads the two into a sexual dilemma as they make a pact to enter into a relationship with ""No Strings Attaches"" in other words no commitment, just sex. However, eventually the strings have to be attached.<br/><br/>The best part of the film is the surprisingly accurate and realistic interactions that Emma and Adam together. They are definitely not faking it as they recreate relationship situations by acting weird around each other, which is exactly what you do when you are in a relationship. Their supporting cast was also very important to the entertainment of the film and the theme of differentiation between relationships. The most notable character being Kevin Klines portrayal of Adam's father Alvin as he dates his own son's ex-girlfriends. The film is all about comedy aspect of all of these relationships and leaves out drama for the most part without totally forgetting about it. This does not change the fact that the film has a very touching ending no matter how cliché it is.<br/><br/>If it wasn't for the great casting of Portman and Kutcher at the center of the film creating superb chemistry all would be lost among ever other rom-com. This is because the film isn't original at all. It is just a basic Hollywoodized picture perfect romantic comedy, but sometimes a movie just barely lucks out when a couple stars are able to salvage the overdone cliché storyline. <br/><br/>Many may say that the film is too similar to the recent release of ""Love and Other Drugs"" just a few months ago. However, no matter how similar the basic plot structure of these two films is, they are very different films. While ""Love and Other Drugs"" follows the purely sexual relationship of its two main characters in the same way that ""No Strings Attached"" does, it also delves into the realms of the genre of drama. On the other hand ""No Strings Attached"" avoids those depths and instead relies on the awkward comedy of romantic see it now bliss."

","The American Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences should give their awards conditionally. If you receive an Academy Award for best actor/actress, and then demean it by acting poorly in a subsequent film, you should forfeit the award. This is akin to behaving in a manner unbecoming a professional. Now, I wasn't a big fan of Black Swan, but I did think Natalie Portman deserved the Best Actress award. After watching No Strings Attached, I wonder if I, and others, had been fooled. Admittedly, she didn't have much of a script to work with here in No Strings. At best, her character was two dimensional. But then, she was one of the producers. You'd think she would have been able to tell a flawed script when she saw one.<br/><br/>Like most romantic comedies, you know the ending from the first scene in the movie. This, however, does not mean the film or script is necessarily bad. After all, you know the salesman will die before you even watch Death of a Salesman. It's how you get to that ending that has to be interesting. And in No Strings Attached, that journey is tedious.<br/><br/>Ashton Kutcher, rapidly evolving into the Hugh Grant of American romcoms, plays his usual sensitive, cute but naughty puppy dog role. He basically serves as the eye candy for the female viewers. This is too bad because, as we saw in The Butterfly Effect, he does have talent. Both he and Portman's character lack depth and we can't help but wonder what he sees in her that's so special. No chemistry exists between them or any of the other actors in this film. So there is no romance in this romantic comedy and, what comedy there is, is sophomoric. I am sure that a few 13-year-olds were rolling in the aisles, but that might just be from eating a bad hot dog, which would certainly have been more enjoyable.<br/><br/>I heard that Portman wanted this movie to be the female answer to The Hangover. Personally, I'd prefer a five alarm hangover to watching this movie again."

The first half is raunchy, unfunny sex talk and full of boinking here, there, and everywhere. Got old real fast. Not funny, clever, entertaining, or erotic.

","Well, this movie offers to change course of a relationship: usually, the couple meets, discovers each other and finally expresses their communion in an intimate relationship.

","This movie follows the sexual trists of Adam (Ashton Kutcher) and Emma (Natalie Portman). Adam's life is falling apart: his father (Kevin Kline) is dating his ex (Ophelia Lovibond) and his writing career is going nowhere. He hooks up with Emma, who has a phobia of dating and they agree to continue seeing each other in a series of one-night stands. Things get complicated, however, when they begin developing feelings for each other North of their belt-lines.<br/><br/>The problem with this movie is its trite treatment of the tired convention of the romantic comedy. In essence, it comes off of a caricature of the genre. It has all the awkwardness of ""Stage Beauty"" (2004), but none of its excellence. Jilted, uncomfortable dialog (such as ""Boo! Here comes my dick."") and genuinely off-putting situations (such as the scene in which Adam makes a menstrual-themed mix tape while Emma and her three roommates, one of whom is male, bemoan that their menstrual cycles have synced up).<br/><br/>The film's on redeeming factor was that Natalie Portman is hot and barely clothed throughout the 108 minute run time. While this was certainly an engagement of sorts, it's hardly cinematic. Only the most die-hard fan of romantic comedies will enjoy the same thinly-stretched plot-points that they've seen time and time again.

OK sure he is ""Ashton Kutcher"" but still! <br/><br/>The sex is so good, even though it didn't seem that good in the scene, that they decide to become ""sex buddies"". Natalie Portman is a super Commitafobe and is the driving force that keeps them apart. But eventually blah blah blah you know the rest of the film. <br/><br/>Review: OK this film is terribly written, actually...I take that back. It's not that it badly written it's that it hits all the formulaic RomCom plot points. I guess its predicability is what makes it so annoying. You've seen this movie before and you've seen it done better. <br/><br/>Examples of the terrible writing with clichéd dialogue: ""you always do this, you always find something wrong with everyone who likes you"" ""please say something"" ""I'm not letting you go"" <br/><br/>None of the other side characters are remotely interesting. Every single one of them falls flat. Also the girl who plays the sister of Natalie Portman, they look nothing alike. Not that I have anything against Olivia Thirlby, she was good in the Wackness. <br/><br/>Portman and Kutcher's chemistry is unnatural and lukewarm at best. On another note, Natalie Portman totally owns Ashton Kutcher in this film. She out acts him in almost every scene. Plus she looks smokin gorgeous and Kutcher body is all flabby. I mean come on Ashton I know you're tall and your genes have passed down a ridiculously gorgeous face, but you gotta try a little buddy. <br/><br/>If you're a guy do not see this movie.

That right there is enough to see that someone immature, unrefined and clueless wrote the script. Having still some goodwill left in me, I skip over more stupid scenes and dialogues hoping for something better.
While skipping I come upon so many mindlessly boring dialogues that it didn't take too long to hit the ""stop"" button. The culmination was introduction of our protagonist's dad played by Kevin Klein. Wonderful actor, horrible role. Comes out he slept with his son's ex-girlfriend. In a typical immature, clueless filmmaker fashion, it's all delivered in a matter-of-fact manner.
The story, dialogues, scenes and characters are so dumb, the film is unwatchable.

","""No Strings Attached"" works precisely for one reason, its script. Paramount Pictures, the studio backing the film, allowed the script to be R rated, meaning that ""grown up"" words, the ones that are four letters and need to be bleeped out from standard radio and television could be said. For a film that is about casual sex--one that tries to portray its characters as realistic--these words need to be included in the characters' dialogue. So, yes, thank you Paramount for allowing the script to be R rated.<br/><br/>The plot centers on two characters who have been friends for many years, seeing each other only once in a while over that timeframe. We see each encounter through flashbacks right at the beginning of the film. Eventually, we move to the present, where Emma (Natalie Portman) has moved into the same city as Adam (Ashton Kutcher). They meet up, and decide that they should hang out some time.<br/><br/>Adam ended a relationship with his girlfriend months ago, and one day finds out that his father is now dating the same girl. After some razzing by his friends, he decides to drunkenly call every girl's number that is in his cell phone, in hopes that one of them will have sex with him.<br/><br/>He eventually passes out, waking up naked in the company of four people, one of which happens to be Emma. They end up having sex, and decide to be ""sex buddies"". They won't be in a formal relationship, but they will call one another up if they are ""in the mood"", so to speak. If either character starts to actually feel attraction for the other, they would call this agreement off, and move on with their lives. No feelings would be involved in their interactions with one another, and therefore there would be none hurt of things went sour.<br/><br/>""Where's the conflict?"" is a question that you might be thinking to yourself right now. Well, that comes from one of the characters, (no, I won't tell you which), developing feelings for the other. The rest of the film focuses on the characters' relationship following this revelation.<br/><br/>If you are now thinking to yourself that you know almost exactly how the movie ends, well then you aren't alone. Just by the trailer for ""No Strings Attached"", it's not difficult to figure out the film's conclusion. It won't throw many curveballs your way throughout, and is overall fairly predictable, with only a couple twists that are really any bit surprising. And even those are only surprising because of their timing, not because of what the twist actually was.<br/><br/>Although, I'll admit that I didn't want the film to end. I liked the characters, and I wanted to continue to see what would happen to them. In fact, when ""No Strings Attached"" finally did wrap-up, I think they chose the wrong point to end it. It ends on a little bit of a cliffhanger, where as if it finished earlier, that wouldn't have happened.<br/><br/>As a matter of fact, the ending was actually the worst part of the film, just because it didn't really give a solid conclusion to the story. And no, I'm not hoping for a sequel, even though one is definitely possible. Does that information make you second-guess how you think the film will end? It probably shouldn't.<br/><br/>Anyway, thanks to the R-rated script, the characters actually felt believable and realistic. They still suffer from some of the flaws that come from being in a romantic comedy, mainly their awkward interactions with almost everyone and their somewhat idealistic nature, but that comes with the territory. They are both likable characters, who are actually fair well acted for this kind of thing.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman especially gives a very solid performance, actually being the more energetic person in the duo. Ashton Kutcher is someone I've been told isn't a very good actor, and while I didn't feel he was great, sometimes not really seeming 100% on-board with what he was supposed to be doing, he was competent as the more reserved Adam. The pair had an easy-going chemistry, and because of the script, felt real enough to believe in.<br/><br/>Thanks to the characters being believable and likable, when the film tries to make you emotional, it succeeds. You want to see both characters happy, and when they aren't, you feel sad yourself. When things go right, you almost want to cheer, although it doesn't work quite that well. You'll feel emotion, but not enough to actually bring it out of you. This isn't a tear-jerker or a feel-good film, despite having moments that come close to these levels.<br/><br/>No, what ""No Strings Attached"" tries to do most is to make you laugh. And it will do so, as it is a very funny film. The aforementioned awkward moments and timing are quite charming, the dialogue will make you laugh, and even some of the situations, (sadly many of them ruined in the trailer), will make you chuckle. It isn't really a laugh-out-loud film, but one that will make you laugh quietly to yourself, every now and then bringing out a full-blown laugh.<br/><br/>I liked ""No Strings Attached"", probably more than I rightfully should have. Regardless, I did enjoy it-- having a good time while watching it. The characters were likable, the plot, while predictable, was fun to watch, and the film was on the whole pretty funny. It doesn't do anything new to the romantic comedy genre, but it's an entertaining film that will give you a good time at the theatre, and that's really all you can ask for."

","I saw maybe 20 minutes before I had to turn it off. I like Ashton Kutcher OK and I really like Natalie Portman, but both of them are completely wooden. The writing is horrid. Sometimes it seems like the characters are having two different conversations at the same time. It is so formulaic I think it may have been written on graph paper. The sex is completely lacking in passion. The friendships are baseless and without affection or any semblance of reality. I don't know how they were able to make two such physically attractive people so repulsive. I didn't remotely care about any of the characters. Nor did like any of them. It was so bad I was unwilling to watch another minute, even with the possibility of Natalie Portman nudity. I challenge you to try watching further than 20 minutes."

First of all, you know - before you've seen or read anything about the movie - what you're in for...But if you expect any surprise, you're in for a major disappointment.<br/><br/>Ivan Reitman and his writer follow the romantic comedy handbook we all learned to know and love since ""When Harry Met Sally"" reared its lovely head and changed the game...almost completely. <br/><br/>Alas, even the best recipes don't work every time and ""No Strings Attached"" is really too close and too soft to push any boundaries. And don't get me started with the actors'performance, except for Kevin Kline they're all extraordinarily...unremarkable. Kind of like a bad episode of Ally McBeal, you know the kind, with the little girl and the plumber... <br/><br/>So, I did not enjoy ""No Strings Attached"" even though I certainly can understand those who are too young to have witnessed the genre's evolution might find enjoyable in it.

","I had very low expectations for No Strings Attached. The couple would make the decision to use each, one would fall for the other, and in the end they would live happily ever after. I was correct about the overall story line, but, impressively, the writers found a way the mix in enough comedy to keep you entertained for the full 110 minutes. On top of that, there is enough cutsie romance to make for the perfect date night movie. Comedy to make you laugh and romance to cheer up any romantic girl.... sounds like a romantic comedy to me!<br/><br/>Natalie Portman shows her range of acting abilities by having two extremely different films in theaters at the same time. I was thoroughly impressed with her ability to drop the comedic one liners and portray a unaffectionate woman who's fallen in love realistically. Comparing this to her award-winning role in Black Swan made her abilities even more impressive. I cannot say the same for Ashton Kutcher. He has a great face and is great at comedic acting. However, each serious, romantic scene he was in became unrealistic and uncomfortable. <br/><br/>Overall, this is the perfect date night or girls night movie. It has some great comedic moments and brings in the romance that most ladies love to see.

","""No Strings Attached"" poses the question: Is it possible to have sex with someone without risking that you could fall in love with them? The answer is YES. It also poses the question: Is it possible to make a clichéd and hackneyed film that smells like ass? The answer is YES.<br/><br/>A bland and dated mainstream romantic comedy, which attempts to give itself an edge through raunchy humor and language and situational comedy right from the 80's. Kutcher and Portman have no chemistry. That lack of understanding of how people interact with each other and this carries over to all of the relationships in the film. None of these actors feel like they enjoy each other. You get the sense that Natalie Portman hates everyone she is working with and it's this kind of energy that dominates the film and makes it so painful to watch. The audience sat there like statues for the film hoping they would maybe get a string You know we walk into the movie theater with open minds and goodwill and get hit by this and it's just an affront. It is incoherent, maddening and UN-funny. They had what? 25 million dollars to work out some kind of movie... How about 10 reasonably real moments? That would have been acceptable. They delivered zero. Excuse me? Hello?! I'm sorry Natalie, maybe you had the Oscar deal already dialed in but nonetheless, they're shooting real film here that people watch – Kutcher? You there? Was anybody there? Was Reitman around? What the hell is going on here? C'Mon folks! Let's step up to the plate. You're all getting a nice stack of cash – Can't you put just a little bit of work into it? Let's go! C'Mon Reitman! Snap snap. Wake the hell up kids! Time to pull the star out of your ass!

","What is most fascinating about this movie is that it's a raunchy rom-com from the female perspective. Knowing that the film was written by a woman prior to my viewing it made the nuances jump out to me. It's those nuances and that perspective that make the film enjoyable. No one scene or moment merits more then a minor chuckle but the characters themselves expand and grow as the story unfolds. It's hard to care about the leads at first because there's no set up or real establishment of character. Then, they kind of grow on you even though neither really rang true for me in any real world sense. Natalie Portman is great as many would expect but Ashton Kutcher did a fine job as well. I've seen others criticizing his performance but I think that's based on a pre-determined hatred of him rather than on his work. The supporting characters were VERY weak and useless save for the father character played by the wonderful Kevin Kline. Overall, better than I was expecting it to be."

","As a man, I'll complain to an expected level every time about having to watch romantic comedies with my wife, but I can admit that I find most of them fairly enjoyable in the end.<br/><br/>Not so much with this one.<br/><br/>This movie brought to mind two movies from the late '80s, not because of any similarity in content.<br/><br/>The first was ""Funny Farm."" When Chevy Chase's wife reads the first chapter of his manuscript, it's so bad that she actually cries before ripping it to shreds in an honest critique.<br/><br/>I don't know how this wasn't everyone's reaction to this script. It was just all over the place. The connection between Portman and Kutcher's characters is never close to believable, and the rest of the characters add nothing. Add in a ton of crudity presented with all the subtlety of ""Beavis and Butt-Head"" (and I say this as a big fan of that show, but I think this movie fancies itself as better than that), and it just left me scratching my head. I'm not an expert on the process of making films, but it seems like there are plenty of places along the way to recognize a real stinker. How was this movie ever made? <br/><br/>The other movie that came to mind was ""Steel Dawn,"" with Patrick Swayze. What the heck was Swayze doing in that movie, after ""Dirty Dancing""? The same goes with all the big names in this one. I noticed that Natalie Portman was an executive producer, so she had to, I guess, but what is everyone else's excuse? What were Kutcher, Kline, and Cary Elwes (in a non-existent role in which he was practically unrecognizable) thinking? Even Ludicrous (I know how his name is really spelled, but it's fixing it for me), who is still working to establish himself as an actor, was too good for this one.<br/><br/>There just wasn't a thing endearing about this film. I was shocked to come here and see that so many people liked it. Maybe I just don't get it.<br/><br/>The worst part? My wife keeps forgetting to take the disc back to Red Box, so we're still paying a buck a day to have it in our home. I need to call her right now."

I like romantic comedies but they took out everything that I like about them and left me with everything that I don't like about them.<br/><br/>It's vulgar as they promised but with no greater purpose and for no higher comedy.

","I always considered Natalie Portman as an outstanding actress and was surprised to see her name linked to Ashton Kutcher, notoriously a lot less outstanding. However, hoping for some light entertainment I decided to watch this movie. Regrettably, it turned out even worse than I expected. Portman plays a doctor who thinks she is tough, but in reality is just a hamster (the only funny joke of the movie). Kutcher plays a mild mannered guy, who has the misfortune of being weighted down by a questionable ex-girlfriend and by a vain, silly father. They both are supported by the usual cohort of unbearable friends who are a fixed showcase of all such comedies. The whole cast is equally intolerable and predictable to the utmost. If I ever saw a paint-by-number movie it has to be this one. Absolutely no way of spoiling it, as it is crystal clear from the start how it will end. I am still recovering from the shock of seeing Portman in this piece of unbearable s**t. But I learned my lesson and from now on I will try my best to avoid all movies with Kutcher in it."

","This film is about two sex friends who, slowly but surely, develop feelings for each other.<br/><br/>Considering the cast and the big budget, ""No Strings Attached"" is very disappointing. The two leads are very attractive, but they have little chemistry with each other. Maybe it's to do with the nature of their initial relationship, they do not have any sparks with each other, and hence their subsequent feelings seem so forced and unrealistic. There is little comedy either, the whole plot is plainly delivered. With nothing much to laugh about, no romance to savour, ""No Strings Attached"" becomes a lacklustre bore."

Well, No Strings Attached definitely falls in to the 'take your brain out' category. The trailer sells it as a sexy and witty rom-com when in fact it is neither of those things. It is a dull, plodding experience with an obvious outcome and little inbetween. Sure it's stars are beautiful but do we care for these people, do they deserve or earn our respect and well wishes over the course of the film? Are we desperate for them to get together at the end? A world of no. Ashton Kutcher is no movie star, he is pretty and every inch the MTV presenter, but he cannot carry a film and such is his real life status, is virtually impossible to sympathise with. Natalie Portman on the other hand is a proved quality actress yet she can't help lift this out of the doldrums. Neither sexy or funny."

","'No Strings Attached' is a rehash of a concept beaten down to pulp a zillion times in Hollywood. Countless movies have played upon the theme of a couple starting off on a strictly physical relationship but end up in love. <br/><br/>Adam (Ashton Kutcher) and Emma (Natalie Portman) play old friends who bump into each other in Los Angeles and exchange numbers. While Adam works on a TV show and is an aspiring screenwriter, Emma works as a resident in a local hospital. <br/><br/>On a drunken night after having found that his ex-girlfriend has hooked up with his father, Adam calls up every girl on his phone seeking the obvious. The next morning, he finds himself at Emma's apartment. Emma, who doesn't believe in relationships, has a proposition for him: to use each other as 'friends with benefits'.<br/><br/>Interestingly, there is film titled 'Friends with Benefits' starring Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis set to release this year. So much so for rehashed concepts.<br/><br/>While the arrangement works well in the beginning, Adam starts taking more interest in Emma, especially getting jealous when he sees her with a fellow resident. Obviously, she doesn't like it. Nevertheless, the audience is never told the reason for her aversion to relationships. Instead, it tries to thrive by bringing in some comedy.<br/><br/>After things seem to start getting mushy, the couple part ways. But, it doesn't take too long for Emma to feel for Adam either. Then, when Adam attempts to hang out with other girls, Emma barges in and drives the girls away. <br/><br/>While these flicks have worked in the past culminating in a romantic ending, it gets too hackneyed. Just having different faces and a different location doesn't really work. Either they had to be too emotional or plain funny; and this falls in between. <br/><br/>You may not regret watching this on a lazy Sunday on TV when you are flipping through channels.

","Yes, one only, the wedding of the protagonist Emma's (Natalie Portman) sister that marks the conclusion of the movie. The funeral is at the beginning, all in the same family, of her father. While the title is as banal as can be, it aptly describes the essence in this rom-com. And you have seen it often enough, most recently probably in ""Love and other drugs"", someone with a phobia for close relationships. In ""Love and other drugs"", however, there is a good reason: a disease that will mean tremendous sacrifice on the part of the loved one. Here, Emma's resistance is not even explained with any particularly painful previous experience, and is therefore not too convincing. But never mind. This is not a logical-deduction whodunit mystery but rather a Valentine escapade and, as such, perfectly adequate.<br/><br/>To begin with, it has probably one of the most important ingredients of a rom-com, two leads are good-looking and can act the part. Playing Adam, Ashton Kutcher comes with impressive credentials from ""Valentine's day"" which, although an ensemble type of flick, clearly had him and Jennifer Garner top-billed. For Portman, this is of course not ""Black Swan"". But with full professional respect for the movie, she puts in an honest and earnest effort. Chemistry? While evident throughout the movie, the last scene is particularly convincing testimony.<br/><br/>The plot line is simplicity itself: two people agreed on having sex as their only relationship (""sex friends"", ""fxxx buddies"" are two terminologies employed in the movie) end up along the inevitable path of falling in love. All the rest of the movie, coming with a large supporting cast, is just bells and whistles. While everyone did a good job, I'll mention two in particular, and there's a reason for it. Following the popular formula, the movie brings the couple to the final stage of something going wrong. True to this formula, the ""turn-around"" point is triggered by someone close. For Adam, it's his father; for Emma, her sister.<br/><br/>Kevin Kline, looking splendid as ever at 64, plays the 58-year-old father with muscles to spare. This is a pivotal character – by sleeping Adam's ex-girlfriend, he prompts his rueful son into seeking a sexual relationship, ANY sexual relationship, while propels the rest of the story. He even did a number with his own piano accompaniment, immediately bringing back sounds and images from ""De-lovely"" (2004).<br/><br/>If you have seen ""New York, I love you"", it's unlikely that you will forget lovely Olivia Thirlby in one of the most entertaining segments of that star-studded collection of tales from New York. Here, she plays the sister whose wedding is the trigger point to Emma finally breaking free from her self-imposed inhibitions. She role is smaller than Kline's and one can't help hoping that she had more to do in this movie.<br/><br/>My concluding remark has to be a salute to the movie's salute to Peanuts. The mere reference brings so much joy – ""Great Scott"", the Great Pumpkin, and there's even a character named Lucy! Good grief!!"
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","4","29","58","21 January 2011"," Overcooked attempt at ""with it"" sex comedy is too reliant on the formula
","No doubt about it folks, we are in the age of the R-rated sex comedy.  This explosive trend among movies stems from filmmakers and producers'  never-ending pursuit of making the rare comedy that costs little but  rakes in obscene amounts of money. ""No Strings Attached"" fits the exact  profile of a film quite literally strung together with the hopes of  getting its cup under the R-rated sex comedy tap and catching a few  precious drops of what has been comedy gold the last five years. And if  2011′s first romantic comedy is any indication, that cup hath runneth  dry.  Natalie Portman, the darling of Hollywood right now coming off her  Golden Globe (and what will likely be an Oscar) win for ""Black Swan""  and the somehow always-popular Ashton Kutcher co-star in what amounts  to ""Friends with Benefits 101,"" or a very rudimentary telling of how  two people come to and work through a decision to use each other  strictly for sex. Although no movie has highlighted this story line so  explicitly, most young people are aware of the concept, yet the film  takes us through the motions as if we're all 50-something and aren't  aware such progressive sexual arrangements exist.  That's why veteran director Ivan Reitman (""Ghostbusters"") proves  immediately to be out of place. He appears to have been handed  Elizabeth Meriwether's script and told ""this is what's popular now, go  do it."" Meriwether certainly didn't go out of her way to divert from  formula as ""No Strings"" overflows with plot-subservient supporting  characters (the roommates and friends of our ""not lovers"") and  injections of foul-mouthed humor, but a more modern comedy director  wouldn't have exposed those ploys as brutally as Reitman does.  The film takes us from the beginning of Adam and Emma's  acquaintanceship (they were never really friends before the sex  happened), which started at a summer camp when Adam attempted to mope  about his parents' divorce to Emma in hopes of a sympathy hook up.  Deciding to be frank, he asks to finger her. This is the movie's first  attempt at slapping in ""modern"" and ""R-rated"" sex jokes. Maybe that  would've been funny in 2005, but our over- exposure to dirty dialogue  in film has  and rightfully so  desensitized us to laughing at, for  example, any time the word ""penis"" or a variation on ""penis"" gets  tossed into a movie script as ""No Strings"" so often does. In fact, by  comparison to similar comedies, the movie hardly warrants an R rating.  As romantic comedy fans know, however, great chemistry in the leads can  help remedy even the worst of situations. To some degree, Portman and  Kutcher have something that works, but Adam and Emma are so poorly set  up that it slightly undermines Kutcher's sweet and surprisingly  sympathy-worthy performance and Portman's excellent ability to reveal  all her characters' inner thoughts and feelings. When they first have  sex, it should in theory be an enormous release of sexual tension for  the audience, but it feels as if it just happens for the sake of there  being a movie. That's the real problem with ""No Strings Attached"": as  genuine as the characters can feel at times, they all ultimately feel  like pawns of or cogs in a formula to deliver us a story. A good film  executes like a real-life or at least intriguing situation that the  audience gets to peek in on.  So like any film with an absurd amount of pieces, the characters  surrounding Adam and Emma either insignificant to us or we like them  but their screen time is completely short- changed. Meriwether would  have been better served to cut down on the amount of friends and  roommates and relatives and add dimension to the better of the bunch.  Among the list of those who deserved more attention are Greta Gerwig as  one of Emma's roommates, Lake Bell as one of the assistant producers on  the ""Glee""-type TV show Adam works for and SNLer Abby Elliot as a  bartender who does weird impersonations. Unfortunately, the most  intriguing supporting role, belonging to Kevin Kline as Adam's former  TV star dad who starts seeing his ex-girlfriend and loves drugs, falls  flat.  The lack of laughs and botched attempts at ""hip"" jokes, however, are  the root of the film's problems. After Emma gets drunk on tequila shots  one night after she and Adam have decided to sleep with other people,  she goes to Adam's place and finds him with two other girls whom she  proceeds yell at, calling them ""pumpkins"" for absolutely no reason. It  plays like a bad cut of improv, but Reitman seems to have blind faith  that that's what ""comedy"" is these days.  You'd really like to give credit to Portman, Kutcher and many of the  other actors who attempted to build likable characters despite how  processed they come across in the story itself, but ""No Strings  Attached"" never relents in its dependency on formula. We all know how a  romantic comedy will end (except 2006′s ""The Break-Up""), but when you  know how it will start and middle, that's busting the illusion that  fans of the genre pay good money to be fooled by. Sadly, the fact that  there's no disguising the film's attempt to jump on the sex comedy  bandwagon undermines nearly everything, perhaps even the bandwagon  itself.  ~Steven C"

","A lot of people may know that the raunchy ""friends having sex"" comedy, ""Friends with Benefits"", with Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis, is actually a lot similar to a movie released months before called ""No Strings Attached"", with Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher. But trust me, you would rather see ""Friends with Benefits"". Yes, it's touching at times, and there are few funny chuckles. But this movie just defines the phrase ""romantic comedy"" in a very ""not so good"" way. Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher star as Emma and Adam, two ""friends with benefits"" who have a sexual relationship, and they make sure to not crush on each other. Portman is lovely, but she makes me lose my last nerve with all of her complaining and all of her crankiness. I don't care if she's scared of commitment, so I just wish that she would just accept the commitment, and stop complaining about it already. Kutcher wasn't really that funny in this movie, and he only delivers a few chuckles. But he's still a pretty cool guy in this movie. It takes forever to get through this entire relationship. The sex scenes both start and end too quickly, and we are left with a boring remaining piece of the movie filled with cheesy clichés and loss of laughter. A fine actor that looks embarrassed to be in this mess is Kevin Kline, who plays Kutcher's father 'slash' former T.V. actor, a weed-smoking, body-building idiot who ends up hooking up with young, 20-year-old women. Oh, that's hilarious...not! This is a slow and cheesy romantic comedy without the heart, and without the laugh-out-loud laughs, when all we get are chuckles. When the movie tries to be heartwarming, it just leaves to be too predictable. Director Ivan Reitman should have known that this was not the right movie for him to be directing. Why should he waste his time on a useless sex comedy? I really thought that this movie was going to be okay, so I'm kind of disappointed. But everything from the useless sex scenes to the cheesy romance, I see this more as a drama, more than a romantic comedy. This movie has a great premise, but it's done in a weird point of view. Portman and Kutcher make good chemistry, but they mostly struggle during the sex scenes and emotional scenes. This movie really tried it's best to be a fun and entertaining film, but even if this movie didn't make me want to kill myself, or I wasn't thinking that I wanted to hate this movie with so much fury, it instead just made me say ""no"" to myself, and then I forgot about this movie in the next minute. ""No Strings Attached"", in my review, ""a shamefully obnoxious sex comedy that drags""."

","Two friends, Emma (Natalie Portman) and Adam (Ashton Kutcher), decide to have a pact where they would have casual sex whenever they needed it, and not bring in emotional baggage and work that goes into building an actual relationship; i.e., sex with 'no strings attached'. <br/><br/>This is one of three prominent movies around casual sex and 'friends with benefits' that popped up in 2011. 'Friends with Benefits' starring Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake follows a similar thread. 'Love and Other Drugs' starring Jake Gyllenhall and Anne Hathaway also apparently started out in the same vein, but developed into something between a drama around Parkinsons and a Viagara drug biopic.

","It is true that it is predictable, that it resorts to stereotypes and clichés when it comes to side characters or plot development, very remarkably in specific scenes. It is a romcom after all, but it can still reach you in a level because there is an underlaying reality beneath the main characters. Even if they are not developed very deeply their attitudes and reactions reflect authenticity specially in the case of Emma (Portman). Yes its a bit exaggerated and dramatized, the humorous side is supposed to be brought out, but how she fears getting involved and is incoherent with what she thinks she wants, how in the crave of self protection she is totally irreverent to feelings of another and doesn't care hurting if it turns things to a saver stage (""I think you should sleep with someone, Ill sleep with someone too"") are schemes that are not normally portrayed in romantic comedies but real people trigger. That is why despite all the clichés one can actually get emotionally involved and of course enjoy the comical part as well which has some good points.<br/><br/>One side comment for sex scene: FOREPLAY PLEASE I seriously doubt many women could actually enjoy sex like that and promoting that image doesn't help. <br/><br/>I liked very much the acting of Natalie Portman even if its not a great role; its what puts the movie together and Kutcher is not that bad.

","This is basically your typical run-of-the-mill romantic comedies. There is nothing innovating or new to be seen or experienced throughout the course of this movie, and that makes the movie experience less than adequate.<br/><br/>The story in ""No Strings Attached"" is as oh-so-many other romantic comedies; a guy and a girl from two very different aspects of life come together and find love. But of course, the budding love is not to be had that easily, they have to overcome the obstacle between them and true bliss. Sounds familiar? Yeah, it does, doesn't it?<br/><br/>As for the acting in the movie, then they had managed to put together a good enough ensemble of people. However, there wasn't really much working chemistry between Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher on the screen, and it didn't work all that well in favor of the movie. It was a shame that Cary Elwes only had such a small role in the movie, and I would have liked to seen more of Kevin Kline.<br/><br/>This movie may be well worth your time if you are a big fan of these ""off the assembly line"" romantic comedies.

"A_Different_Drummer","8","10","18","11 December 2016"," Portman is an absolute joy
","It is interesting, to this reviewer, how the IMDb membership tends to sometimes voice concerns that the mainstream reviewers miss or overlook.<br/><br/>The mainstream critics (which you check for yourself, link on the title for this film) either felt that the script worked and produced an entertaining movie -- or that the script failed, and the movie lacked punch.<br/><br/>Almost universally, however, Ms. Portman's performance was praised. Some felt, in fact, that it carried the entire movie (Kutcher's career, like that former romantic lead Freddie Prinze, tends to veer more toward ""straight man"" ie, as merely the ""sparkplug"" for whomever he is playing against.) Here on IMDb however I find reviews that go further than the mainstream critics, and actually seemed annoyed at Ms. Portman for taking the role in the first place...? As if the role (or the movie, or the script) was beneath her? In the opinion of this reviewer, Ms. Portman 'is' the movie. The script is OK -- perhaps with some excellent moments here and there, both verbal and slapstick -- and the co-stars are also merely OK.<br/><br/>But it is the comic timing and willingness of Ms. Portman to throw herself 100% into such an initially weak character ... and the make that character stronger and more interesting than the scriptwriter ever imagined. This is what carries the film, and this is what holds it together and makes it work.<br/><br/>I will add to this review the same remark I penned recently in another review of a so-called ""High Concept"" Hollywood comedy -- Ghost Town 2008 --- namely that, at the end of the day, when this film goes into the great digital archive and becomes available to viewers of the future (as in, two generations from now or more), the sneers from today's viewers will fade away and be replaced by the observation that, like Tea Leoni, Ms. Portman simply did not do enough films to satisfy her fans."

","A generally amusing movie that is badly marred by an unnecessary excess of really crude vulgarities. I'm no prude, loved Animal House, and am a fan of action movies loaded with well-done sex and violence. That being said, however, I found myself wincing when a character early in the show looks at the girl sitting next to him and says ""can I finger you""? It is way more than just being ""uncool"". That and several other glaringly crude lines showed the audience just how the use of words turns a ""player"" into a complete ass. There was a lot of murmuring from the audience, which is not good.<br/><br/>Otherwise, the movie could have stood quite well on its own. Light romantic comedy is great when well done, and well done in this genre almost always means subtle and classy. When you lose your ""classy"" you come across as just another jerk. Even Animal House would have avoided some of these lines.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman is OK in this role, but not great. She might be getting a little too old to play the young chick role. Ashton does remarkably well, and we will enjoy seeing him in many more roles if he avoids the ""all looks and no acting ability"" horde of current young actors. I hope he gets good guidance during his formative acting years.<br/><br/>Had it all been just a tick more classy, yet still very sexy, this movie could have had much greater audience appeal."

So to be leading up to an Oscar nomination and probable win no doubt. Your life really seems to be on a upswing professionally and personally. So not that I am anyone at all but as a big movie fan I'm here with some movie advice. I recently just saw your newest film No Strings Attached which hit no. one this weekend, another congrats. Unfortunately I must tell you it was pretty bad and I'm shocked that you stooped to such confused, sordid material and with a half assed performance that was without a doubt the worst of your career. And that is truly saying something because your performance was okay, pretty generic because you've had such an accomplished career thus far. My advice would be stay away from such cinematic turkeys as this. Yes your role was completely underwritten and your character had little to no reasoning of why she acted the way she did but despite that the humor came across as crude and vulgar and the movie felt so unnecessarily long and not long enough at the same time as it came to it's ridiculous and confusing unending. In fact I would like to say in fact that the best part of the movie was surprisingly Ashton Kutcher that found a way to show some actual range with his performance. Maybe there is hope for him yet if he could just escape the horrible type casting. Sure the film had moments and you certainly elevated that dinner scene with Kevin Kline but only momentarily. Now I'm not saying you were the worst part of the film at all that was the actual film and running a close second was a supporting role by Ludicrous. And I'm certainly not trying to be insulting but as an avid fan I'm just suggesting you stick with better material and make the films you've always made respectably and no pander down to such trite, nonsensical, unmemorable and excuse if this is harsh dumb garbage. Not saying this the worst film I've ever seen in fact it's far from it but that's precisely the category it lands in and everyone associated with this should know better. For now a slap on the hand but next time I will start to loose faith. I'm crossing my fingers for Thor.<br/><br/>**/5<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Richard Cavellero"
"ghost_dog86","3","8","15","27 January 2011"," No Strings Attached: Another Ashton Kutcher film. That may be all you need to know.
","Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole Ashland<br/><br/>""No Strings Attached"" is about as good as any Ashton Kutcher movie could be. Surprisingly directed by Ivan Reitman (Up in the Air, Ghostbusters) and starring the aforementioned Ashton Kutcher (Dude, Where's My Car?, That 70s Show) and Natalie Portman (seriously, what is she doing in this movie?! She was the lead in ""Black Swan"" for god sakes!) as two twenty-something's who make an arrangement , as an alternative to dating, to simply use each other for sex with, you guessed it, ""no strings attached"". And as a result, this played out premise leaves audiences with; you guessed it, ""much to be desired"". This film also costars Kevin Kline (A Fish Called Wanda, The Ice Storm) in the worst role of his career (yes, worst than ""Wild Wild West""), but I will talk more about him later in this review.<br/><br/>Side Note: Another startling revelation about ""No Strings Attached"" is that Elizabeth Meriwether (a writer whom I have been hearing was the next great female screenplay writer in Hollywood) was responsible for writing this amateurish (at best) script. Here is all you need to know. This is a romantic comedy, with very little comedy and almost no romanticism at all. Have you ever seen a romantic comedy where you don't want to two main characters to get together in the end? No? Well, this might be the first.<br/><br/>Dear Natalie Portman, I know you probably had tons of fun making ""No Strings Attached"", much more fun than the audience did watching it, but please go back to making serious dramas. This was not a good career move and you have a child to worry about now. So throw Ashton and Demi's phone number away and sign on for ""Black Swan 2"" before it's too late.<br/><br/>Signed, The dwindling number of fans you have left.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman, is a really great actress and makes the most out of this poorly written character (one of the only reasons to see this movie), but if the movie is not very good then who cares how well she did, really. In fact many of the female performances in this movie are not bad, but the male performances from Kutcher and Kline are so whiny and pathetic (Meriwether's fault) that this film is borderline offensive to men (or anyone with eyes or ears for that matter).<br/><br/>Back to Kevin Kline. What Kline has done here is literally taken his career out back and shot it in the head. His character is working with the most distracting dialogue; spewing non sequiturs as if the audience is supposed to think he is quirky or something when all it is, is confusing. It gets to the point where, every time he is on screen, it is literally the most awkward point in movie history.<br/><br/>Final Thought: By this point, you know if ""No Strings Attached"" is a movie for you or not. If all you need in a movie experience is to see Ashton Kutcher's butt, then by all means this is the movie for you. Again, I don't blame Kutcher for this movie, because by now it is clear that he is only capable of playing the same role over and over again. <br/><br/>Please visit my page on Examiner.com http://www.examiner.com/x-52464-San-Jose-Indie-Movie-Examiner and leave any comments you have about this or any review.

","For starters, the answer for that question is because I expected a funny, light, sit-down-and-laugh comedy. But what'd I get? A boring, slow, and simply very bad teaching-movie-wannabe.<br/><br/>I think the fact that I wanted to stop watching even after about 20 minutes kind of describes my image of this film. It was very hard to not do so, because the movie was full of boring, bad cut scenes which are often awkward, too. I could not laugh at all.<br/><br/>I suspect the main problem here is that it wanted to be too serious. It certainly shouldn't have. The theme just doesn't allow that, at least not for a this kind of movie without a really surprising twist in the story. This is why the movie was so slow, instead of funny. This atmosphere spoiled the jokes. The creators must've felt it, and that's why they made a pathetic attempt after the actual ending (which, of course, is a predictable one).<br/><br/>It also lacks a lot when it comes to the characters. They're very unnatural and badly depicted. The best example for that is Adam'coworker. I absolutely could not understand her part in the movie. The acting was also bad, but it hardly could've been better with other actors.<br/><br/>Overall, I found this movie to be very artificial and empty.

","Adam (Ashton Kutcher) and Emma (Natalie Portman) met each other once at a school summer camp but never committed. Several years later and they meet again. Adam is now a writer and an assistant on a TV show and she's a nurse. When Adam discovers that his father Alvin (Kevin Kline), a washed-up actor, is having a relationship with his ex-girlfriend, he goes on an all-night bender. Waking up in Emma's house, he finds comfort in her and they have spontaneous sex too. They decide that they should restrict their relationship to this level as she isn't comfortable with dating. She decides to keep it a secret from her housemates Patrice (Greta Gerwig) and Shira (Mindy Kaling). Typically, Adam feels left out by this demand and tries to develop the relationship into something more with the help of his friends Wallace (Ludacris) and Eli (Jake M. Johnson).<br/><br/>Last year I praised a rejuvenating American comedy called Easy A for being witty, economical and charming in its outlook on sex and conformity. No Strings Attached, this year's major Valentine's Day release directed by Ivan Reitman, is not that movie. It reminded me more of a scene from Annie Hall, where Woody Allen asks a couple why they are happy. The girl responds: ""I'm very shallow and empty and I have no ideas and nothing interesting to say"". Her boyfriend adds: ""I'm exactly the same way."" The very familiar premise here of friends with benefits, covered most recently in Love and Other Drugs, leaves substantial motives by the wayside in favour of star power. The only mildly surprising element here is some of the unnaturally crude dialogue provided by first time feature writer Elizabeth Meriwether. She lends some cringing lines to scenes that are so prosaic that they are lacking in dramatic and comedic punch. Centuries on and we're still watching that moment where one person falsely believes that the other is already accounted for.<br/><br/>Ivan Reitman's film also feels overlong and badly paced too. It lumbers ridiculously just under the two hour mark, slipping well into repetition before the credits start. And successful comedy is found in not just what is said but how it's said. Tone and precision are both crucial. Thus, while Ashton Kutcher is a popular performer, he's so relaxed in this film that his character lies somewhere between dope and sleepwalker. I just didn't find any of his dialogue to be particularly funny. Portman has a little more energy, particularly in the second half, but her characterisation shifts so jarringly from scene to scene. The comic timing she deftly showed in Garden State is absent because she isn't given many good lines to work with either. Considering the material and how unbalanced the film is towards her character, it surprised me to see that she backed the film herself as one of the producers. More fun is to be had with some of the side characters, like Wallace, with the little time they have on screen. Greta Gerwig (a breakthrough performance in Greenberg last year) is rarely seen and Kevin Kline is underused. Consider how much you love your date before seeing this."
"Troy_Campbell","5","3","4","4 March 2011"," Indifferent.
","It has been said by many filmmakers and critics that the only thing worse than a movie you hate is a movie you feel nothing for, one way or another. Ivan Reitman's latest effort unfortunately fits into that mould a little too well. I didn't dislike this new age rom-com, it has its moments, but I left the cinema pondering whether I should get some dinner after eating so many M&Ms and didn't give this film a second thought until I sat down to write this.<br/><br/>Even now, considering what I should mention in this review, I am finding it hard to pinpoint what was actually good or bad about No Strings Attached; the whole affair was just so indifferent. Elizabeth Meriwether's screenplay was occasionally witty but never strayed from the typical 'boy-meets-girl, boy-loses-girl, boy-gets-girl' template. Reitman plays it safe behind the camera, a shame for the man who was responsible for comedy gold of the Ghostbusters, Stripes and Meatballs ilk.<br/><br/>It would be easy to say this work is below Portman, because it is. She brings her normal allure to the proceedings, but ultimately doesn't have enough to sink her teeth into. On the other hand, Kutcher looks right at home as the affable goof. He's on autopilot for sure, although if this is as far as his acting chops stretch then good on him for riding the wave for as long as possible. Kline and Elwes add experience, if not excitement, whilst young blood Gerwig and Thirlby show glimpses of why they're on the up in Hollywood.<br/><br/>I didn't feel attached to No Strings in any way.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Average, 3 - Good, 4 - Great, 5 - Brilliant)"
"lois-lane33","3","4","6","15 September 2014"," ""It's like a crime scene in my pants""
","Is just one of the classics uttered in this cheese doodle of a film. Others not far down the line include the all time great ""we are sluts we are sluts we are all just sluts"" & ""my underwear is dirty"" (referring to a gal who just gots her period the previous day) It's a freakishly bad movie about screwin' and sweet nuthin' else. I think that people go to these films lured by the prospect of a few laughs but when a film starts talking about screwin' by usin' the friggin' F word repeatedly ya knows ya gots droppin's for a movie. I thought this movie truly sucked and not because I'm a Natalie Portman hater-on the contrary I've seen her in some fairly good movies- same with Ashton Kushner. This just ain't a decent script and it makes you pity the characters. The writers seem to think they are endearing the characters to the audience but it does't work. The bad lines are so frequent they paint themselves onto your brain one after another like listening to someone speak in a bad dream. This film sucks. Really really really. It's like Seth Rogan wrote it. Maybe his penis did."

","OK... i was NOT expecting much from this movie but i was really WOW at the end!!!<br/><br/>Yes, the movie was alright for some but I LOVED IT!!! As a Natalie Portman FAN, i was really worried about her doing a full-on Comedy role... from her past films like Leon and the Star Wars movies (Her role: Padme Amidala has a SAD ending...) Closer, V for Vendetta, Brothers... her roles from these movies were sad and sweet and her recent film Black Swan - she was super-powerful and gave an Oscar Winning role as Nina!!! I was so happy after watching No Strings Attached - Natalie Portman was super, super FUNNY - she did an amazing job!!! There are scenes where Natalie Portman is over-the-top - but i think she was great... the amount of ''BAD WORDS'' in the movie is WOW... loads of it!!!<br/><br/>The movie overall was good - Ashton Kutcher was alright & funny..... did an OK/ good job! The side-actors were average and the soundtracks were good...<br/><br/>Anyways, No Strings Attached is a must-watch movie!<br/><br/>My review: 7/10"

","This movie was quiet charming to watch. If you love good funny romance, watch this, it will truly melt your heart, it might even relate to you. Its one of those movies that doesn't really get recognized because its a romance movie and most romance movies are the same, but there's something about it that sticks out and should be recognized.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman was great in this movie, her emotions felt real. As for Ashton he did alright. I'm rating this a 10, just cause Natalie Portman captured me in her performance and I'm suddenly a big fan of hers. And I love movies that makes me smile and tear up a little. Thats always a deal breaker to me."
"claudio_carvalho","7","10","21","5 August 2011"," Silly and Incoherent Plot, but Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher Make the Film Worth
","Fifteen years ago, Adam Franklin (Ashton Kutcher) and Emma Kurtzman (Natalie Portman) meet each other in a colony and every now and then they stumble on each other.<br/><br/>In the present days, Emma is an MIT graduated doctor and Adam is the stage assistant of a TV musical show and aspirant screenplay writer. When Adam visits his father Alvin (Kevin Kline), who is a successful TV producer, and finds that his ex-girlfriend Vanessa (Ophelia Lovibond) has moved to Alvin's house and is dating him, he gets totally drunk and calls every girl in his cell phone's contact list. On the next morning, he wakes up at Emma's apartment and they have quick sex. Emma does not want to have any emotional involvement and proposes a relationship driven by sex only without romance or commitment. But love is not possible to be rationalized and the couple is affected by their behavior.<br/><br/>""No Strings Attached"" is a romantic comedy with a silly and incoherent plot since the motives for the behavior of Emma are not well developed and she becomes an inconsistent lead character. The story is visibly inspired on the adorable ""When Harry Met Sally"", with elements of Glee and spiced with sex. <br/><br/>However, the film is cute and the chemistry between the lovely Natalie Portman and the pleasant Ashton Kutcher make the film worth. I believe that a high percentage of viewers love Natalie Portman and it is a pleasure to see this talented actress in any movie. <br/><br/>Kevin Kline has a small part but is also hilarious. This is the first time that I pay attention in Lake Bell and she is really a beautiful woman performing the role of a clumsy and nerd character. However several support characters are neither funny nor interesting. My vote is seven.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Sexo Sem Compromisso"" (""Sex Without Commitment"")"
"Samiam3","5","11","25","22 January 2011"," Not even close
","I should probably have seen it coming. Considering that neither Natalie Portman nor Ashton Kutcher have done anything remotely funny, and Ivan Reitman hasn't directed anything great since Kindergarden Cop, I wonder what it is that gave me hope that No Strings Attached could be any good. It's a bland experience, with bad acting, too much contrivance for comfort, and questionable focus. The vast bulk of the jokes fall flat, and the few that don't aren't very original.<br/><br/>Even from the get go, you have the feeling that this movie is doing something wrong. In the first few minutes it jumps from ten years, to five years to the present day, and asks us to accept the fact that two people who met at a party and haven't spoken since would remember each other after several years. It's hard to say whether laughter was the intended reaction, but it feels far more awkward to the viewers than it does to the characters. <br/><br/>It might have helped if anyone in the cast was trying, but nobody is. Ashton Kutcher, is potentially forgivable when considering that the role is way beyond him, but Natalie Portman, is not so easy to forgive. Her performance reeks of personality swings between girlish and womanish, she fails to sell emotion, and also she plays drunk like she's had no acting experience. Kevin Kline and Ludicrous are painfully underused in their supporting roles. This brings me to another problem with No Strings attached; too much of the plotting feels unnecessary. I would have liked it if the move spend more time with the lead couple. Instead, we have to ensure a time passing montage of sexual encounters, which rob us of the comedy and the credibility. <br/><br/>Whatever it is that may sound appealing about No Strings attached is probably misleading. It's far too lazy and incompetent to be worth anyone's time."

Emma is a doctor, and Adam is a script assistant for Glee like series. The pair decide to just have sex, and still remain friends, no romance. But will they hold up?<br/><br/>Ashton Kutcher and Natalie Portman have good chemistry, but there performances are pretty weak in the first half, but they get better a little has it goes on. And when it comes to sex talk, it was not clever has it tried to be, it came off sounding more annoyingly awkward. Kevin Kline shines as Kutchers movie star, pot smoking father.

"Ryan_MYeah","5","4","7","14 July 2011"," It's cute, it's just not cute enough.
","In the film, Ashton Kutcher plays Adam, a stand by assistant for a TV show who, after finding out his dad is dating his ex-girlfriend, calls up all the women on his phone until someone agrees to sleep with him. The next day, he passes out naked on the couch in a home of his once Summer camp friend Emma (Played by Natalie Portman). She's a medical resident in L.A. who's overly frightened of the concept of a real relationship. Together, the two of them create a system for themselves to use each other for sex at any time, until one of them falls for each other.<br/><br/>I wanted to like No Strings Attached more than I actually did. It's not terrible, but I really think there was so much untapped potential. First problem with the film is the script and tone. The film can't decide whether it wants to be a serious romance, or a silly, sometimes raunchy Rom-Com. The serious bits are probably the more interesting, but the film just flip flops from charming to dull too often.<br/><br/>The only real glimmer of hope is Natalie Portman. Emma is not that well written a character, but someone as energetic and charismatic as Portman brings full enjoyability out of it. It's hard to keep your eyes off of her in any scene she's in. However, despite moments of sentimental chemistry between her and Kutcher, the romance feels contrived, and not much of the other cast are that great. Even talents like Kevin Kline and Olivia Thirlby can't bring much out of their inconsistently written characters.<br/><br/>Overall, No Strings Attached is not that great, but as a date night popcorn flick... you're still probably better off choosing something else.<br/><br/>I give it ** out of ****"

","Reel Thing Rating: 1 out of 5 Reels<br/><br/>Since our job is to rate the lifelong relationship potential of Adam and Emma, we won't waste our time telling you how unbelievably contrived we thought this movie was. The whole thing felt like a much less charming version of A Lot Like Love. But again, our job is to rate the couple, not the movie, so we won't say anything at all.<br/><br/>Adam and Emma first meet as young teens at summer camp, and then have repeat collisions over the next few years. Their final encounter happens when both are well into their twenties and their careers and living in LA. After learning one day that his father has been dating his ex-girlfriend, Adam gets incredibly drunk and wakes up the next morning on Emma's couch, with no knowledge of how he got there. Emma takes him into her room where the two share an intimate moment together and then decide, mostly at Emma's insistence, on a ""no strings attached"" physical relationship. Unsurprisingly it is not long before they begin to have feelings for each other, despite the fact that they both try to deny it. Or to be more precise, Emma insists that they not have feelings for each other, and Adam feels compelled to go along with the charade.<br/><br/>We can't see much potential here for these two, and not just because of their attempts to convince themselves that they don't care for each other. Thousands before them have tried and failed to convince themselves of the same thing. We simply see no chemistry here, and no basis for a long lasting connection. Because of their feigned lack of feeling there has never been a discussion of their likes or dislikes, their values, or their future plans or dreams. So we have no grounds on which to judge their compatibility. In addition we don't think they are ready for a real commitment. Emma may be a doctor, but she's extremely emotionally immature. The sex seems to be good for both of them but you have yet to convince us that's a solid foundation.<br/><br/>We'd love to tell you these two are The Reel Thing, but we'd just be stringing you along.<br/><br/>Visit www.reel-couples.com to rate this couple."

","I was actually surprised to see the 6.2 rating, which is still relatively low. Based on the quality of the writing, acting and overall feel of the movie, it should be much lower.<br/><br/>This movie reminds me of the Kesha song ""Blow"", which is surprisingly boring despite all the hype and scandal that she thought were already injected into it (I thought her other songs were much better and was surprised that a Kesha song called ""Blow"" would be a candidate for elevator muzak). This song is still a ""hit"" though, probably to the same knuckle-draggers who gave this movie anything over a 5.1 <br/><br/>For a world class armchair athlete like myself, after about the 10th joke fell flat I essentially fell asleep and was like ""why is this almost 2 hours long?"" and ""WTF is Ludicrous doing in this movie and why is his part so lame?"" and ""What's with the creepy, typical loser friend? That guy makes me want to puke."" The whole concept that the Ashton and Portman characters are ""friends"" doesn't make any sense. They never knew each other. They only met randomly a handful of times and never developed a relationship until they decided to have convenient sex (which was only possible BECAUSE they were never friends...this contradicts the whole marketing campaign).<br/><br/>The problem with this ""pump and dump"" strategy is Ashton turns out to be too much of a cuddler for the clichéd ""daddy issues"" emotional vacuum of the Portman ""modern sexy woman"" character. The movie doesn't develop any of her emotional baggage but superficially it looks like this character isn't that much different from her Black Swan character, ie. she is messed up. She clearly has family problems and is emotionally distant and disturbed. I didn't find her performance in this movie any funnier than her wriggling, feather-plucking one in Black Swan.<br/><br/>I'm sick of these movies. Damaged people trying to have unattached sex to prove they don't have daddy issues is getting older than the old ladies smoking pot clichés that were rampant in the mid 2000s.<br/><br/>Movies about nihilistic promiscuity are boring and you people should be ashamed of yourselves.<br/><br/>You dirty, filthy beasts."

","First of all. I love Natalie Portman. She's my current favorite actress and #1 celebrity crush. But after watching this movie I realized that she came as a hypocrite in terms of credibility. Once she stated that she would never make the kind of movie that Jennifer Love Hewitt does. She thought she was better than that. But ""No Strings Attached"" is the kind of movie JLH would do! I couldn't believe the scene where Natalie holds a wine bottle while yelling and chasing two girls. Pumpkin! Now I hate that word if you know what I mean.<br/><br/>The plot is absurd but delivers expectations for those who are into romantic comedies with sex-oriented humor. The humor is made of sex jokes, funny situations, and physical comedy. Natalie Portman is a great actress and I totally believed her performance. Ashton Kutcher plays himself and that's always good. Lake Bell was really funny and sexy in her own way. I love that chick. Ludicrous was my favorite actor in this one. Kevin Kline also delivered a fine performance. Greta H. is a very talented and attractive blonde. I wanted more of her.<br/><br/>I would only recommend this movie as a last option to watch in the movies.

","As with most romantic comedies they are typically funny and predictable and most teach that love, and life is complex and unexpected. This film ""No Strings Attached"" stays true to it's title it shows love and life is complex and it's made enjoyable by plenty of eye candy scenes of hot steamy sex between the two lead characters! Can just sex lead to love the film leaves you the viewer hoping and maybe guessing still the film's main theme of sex shows that romance of the physical kind is to be enjoyed.<br/><br/>Directed by Ivan Reitman(""Ghostbusters"")this film shows that a romantic commitment is tough to obtain, but the naughty sex is very fun baiting and enjoyable. It involves Emma(Natalie Portman in a very sexy role)who after leaving Michigan for the lands of sunny California to do her medical interns as a doctor meets a boy named Adam(Ashton Kutcher) she knew him in college and now he's a young hotshot who wants to be a sitcom director/ producer. And right away the two agree to have a relationship of bed adventures and just good old fashioned sex.<br/><br/>And this film has plenty of enjoyable eye candy scenes of bed hopping as with each encounter the sex with Emma and Adam becomes more and more steamy and hot. Nice were seeing scenes of Natalie in those sexy light flowered blue and purple colored bras! Anyway as many may know and have experienced sex may lead to love as especially Adam feels emotional attachment, as little lady Emma feels she is to much of a traditional girl to go without a string, so the passions cool off.<br/><br/>Only after both want love especially more so Emma the film's supporting female characters shine more as love proves it finds people unexpectedly and at the least expected times. As Emma's female friends find love. Well what about her and Adam as the film proves and shows starting over is okay as even after all of the hot sex a chance of love still is possible even though it will be complex. Overall pretty good comedy it's a real treat of eye candy as it's theme of sex and bed hopping will have most viewers enjoying and seeing Natalie Portman was a real treat. It's title rings true more and more relationships are for only sex joy with no strings attached as love is only a complex hope."

After another meeting at a frat party, it's several more years before the two meet and eventually decide to have a physical relationship with what the title above implies. I'll just say this was a funny and touching rom-com with plenty of good scenes and lines from the two leads and many of the supporting players like that of Kevin Kline as Kutcher's dad, Lake Bell (who I initially thought was Amanda Peet) as Ashton's production associate, and ""The Office""s Mindy Kaling as one of Ms. Portman's roommates, among others. All of the above was directed by Ivan Reitman who's long provided many entertaining movies these past 30 or so years (of which one of his earliest, Meatballs, is represented by a poster shown in a couple scenes).

"EUyeshima","7","4","9","23 January 2011"," Portman Elevates a Formulaic Rom-Com with Provocative Possibilities
","When actresses of a certain caliber and age reach a certain level of potential bankability and critical respect, it appears inevitable that they do a standard-issue Hollywood romantic comedy. Talent becomes a less critical factor in these casting selections. Early last year, Amy Adams did one between ""Doubt"" and ""The Fighter"", a silly one set in Ireland called ""Leap Year"", and now it's Natalie Portman's turn. This 2011 film has a more provocative premise and a snappier tone, but the sensibilities are still very much in rom-com territory. As written by first-time screenwriter Elizabeth Meriwether and directed by industry veteran Ivan Reitman (whose last film was the overdone ""My Super Ex-Girlfriend""), the movie deftly asks a less than earth-shattering question: can two friends sustain a commitment-free sexual relationship without any emotional expectations? In an age when text messaging makes anyone instantly available, the answer naturally looks to be yes, but Hollywood convention intervenes.<br/><br/>Set conveniently in LA, the plot centers on the friendship between Emma, an overworked medical resident, and Adam, an overlooked production assistant on a ""High School Musical""-type show who longs to be a writer. Moving fleetly from summer camp to a frat party to an accidental run-in at an outdoor market, they definitely have a connection but never act upon it. In the meantime, their personalities take shape as adults nearing thirty. She is an unromantic pragmatist who has convinced herself that she doesn't need a relationship to have sex, while he is a pushover whose airheaded girlfriend dumps him for his father, a self-infatuated former sitcom TV celebrity. After an all-night drunken binge lands a naked Adam in Emma's apartment, she proposes they take advantage of their mutual attraction and start a purely physical relationship with no expectation of commitment. She's in charge, and he agrees to play along. Needless to say, both start to have feelings that pull them in predictable directions with Adam also dealing with his unresolved anger toward his father. There is no real tension to the central dilemma since we all know how the movie will end, especially with stars as attractive and laid-back as Portman and Ashton Kutcher playing the leads.<br/><br/>What I do like is how Portman doesn't subterfuge her own sensibilities as an actress to play Emma within formula. She plays a workaholic but on her terms as a sensible professional who needs to manage her schedule carefully. Unlike rom-com contemporaries like Kate Hudson, Anne Hathaway or Kristin Bell, Portman comes across as too smart to go through much humiliating shtick to get her inevitable comeuppance beyond devouring a box of donut holes. Even though Kutcher has more experience in this genre, he comes across a bit more substantive this time around and shows a natural rapport with Portman that makes the movie breeze along with aplomb. A solid supporting cast helps with Greta Gerwig (""Greenberg"") and Mindy Kaling (""The Office"") as Emma's sharp-tongued roommates; Lake Bell (""It's Complicated"") as Adam's dithering, sweet-natured associate; Jake Johnson and a low-key Ludicrous as his horndog buddies; and Kevin Kline as his vainglorious father. I didn't even recognize Cary Elwes as the veteran doctor whom Emma fawns over. Special mention should go to Rogier Stoffers whose bright-colored cinematography brings contemporary LA to vivid life."

","Didn't like it much. Portman is miscast. She's not sexy or womanly enough for the part. She is a fabulous actress in the right genre. Gerwig was wasted as a side character. She is very quirky and has a unique acting style. Kutcher is comfortable in his main genre. He doesn't seem to age much. Not really that funny, very crude and vulgar, and you don't really see that much anyway if your into sex comedies and alike. Just a lot of crude dialogue. Also I didn't care for either of the main characters. Who gives a toss really."

","No Strings Attached<br/><br/>If there is no string attached, you must seek immediate medical attention, or you could suffer toxic shock.<br/><br/>Oops!

","I noticed prior to seeing this film that there was a small collection of nay sayers who just dismissed this film as cheap trash, in comparison to Natalie Portman's ""Black Swan"".<br/><br/>Well it is not ""Black Swan"" and it is not ""Animal House"" It is ""No strings attached"" which is a new comedy with a new brand of situations. It's awkwardness is it's strength. It is not for anyone under 17 by any means. Unless accompanied by an adult, yada yada.<br/><br/>I liked Ashton in it, which he made many pretty explicit type scenarios somewhat comfortable when watching IMO, which i think is his strong suite, and I also enjoy Natalie even more. So if you take a look at Today's society relationship status.. especially LA and Plug it into the Mind who created animal house such a long time ago, this is what you get...<br/><br/>If you can't feel comfortable with sex and drugs in comedy, you won't like this movie. Yet if you do I would give a good two thumbs up.<br/><br/>On the downside, There isn't any female skin shown... not to be a pervert, but i mean this movie was once titled ""F*** Buddies"" prior to release yet it is all man ass, especially from Kutcher. I know Portman is kinda ashamed of ever showing herself in film which is very easily understood, being such a superstar. Yet just man ass was kind of a bummer. no pun intended. It was done very carefully mind you, in not showing any female anatomy, which is kinda ironic...Like the opening scene of ""Orgazmo""... Anyway.<br/><br/>All the same the film has a good heart, through many drug and sexual references. It is funny! not in an artsy or foreign film type way.. it is an American comedy with American humor... 6/10..."
"JKlivin88","5","3","7","6 May 2011"," Awful. Just awful.
","If you can't make an individual movie, if you have no new ideas, if you are going to totally set bases on previous love-comedies and make a very bad, very improvised film, then just don't try it at the first place: ""No strings attached"" is the case for all things mentioned above. Very predictable plot, total absence of humor, bad dialogues. This is a very, very handy movie.<br/><br/>You may want to see this film because it's new, and the female face of the year -Natalie Portman- is the star alongside Ashton Kutcher (who, incidentally, probably was the only decent thing around). But it is guaranteed that you will just throw away about two hours of yours. I strongly advise you not to do it. This is a bad movie, hoping to gain profit from the star names and the copy-paste of the script from previous films, almost copy-paste of the previous lines. Vwry predictable film, painly not funny, a waste of time. Awful.<br/><br/>P.S.You just need to see two scenes to realise how terrible this movie is, and how lucks any sense of humor: the scene where Natalie Portman wears the 3-D glasses on, and the other where one of her colleagues shouts ""we are sluts, Emma! We are sluts!"". Are you serious people? Things like these may would have been funny if they were not that ground-breaking (if someone watches this, surely they'll understand what I mean by saying that)! Nevertheless, it was much more than clear that the film authors just wanted to introduce some things like these, no matter if they fit or what. What the hell? Some people will find it amusing anyway, it's sure. But whether people generally like it or not, many of them surely will pay the price for the ticket, by the time they see the names of the cast. I repeat, this movie is terrible."
"mikerjones","7","2","4","6 July 2014"," Better than you might think
","I saw this film in a theater while on vacation. I think we saw another movie after this one, so there was a choice. Now, I love Natalie Portman but I don't love every movie she ever made. I hate Ashton Kutcher, but I don't hate every movie he ever made. That said, I thought this movie was watchable and somewhat amusing. I saw it later on TV and nothing changed my mind. There are some really good comedy moments, some really goofy moments, and some really cringe-worthy dialog. No spoilers there. The cast is terrific, even Kutcher did a decent job; Lake Bell can be hilarious. I believe any short-comings (and there are a few) are the result of the script and not the cast. So if you're not someone who absolutely hates rom-coms (and if you are you have no business watching this move or reviewing it - you've been warned) than there is a good chance you will find some things to like. That's about the best you or the movie can hope for."
"hall895","6","2","4","31 May 2014"," Very predictable, reasonably enjoyable
","It is what it is. No Strings Attached is another formulaic romantic comedy. OK, there's a bit of a twist in this one in that the couple doesn't actually want any romance. They skip the love and go straight to the sex, no strings attached indeed. There will be no feelings involved. Wham bam thank you ma'am. Same time tomorrow? But golly gee, these two just might start developing feelings for one another after all. Who ever could have foreseen that? There's a sense of inevitability about this movie from the very first minute. You know where it's headed. The movie may be on a journey to an obvious destination but at least it does a reasonably decent job of entertaining you along the way.<br/><br/>Ashton Kutcher and Natalie Portman play the couple in question, Adam and Emma. Kutcher is never likely to win any major acting awards but he is serviceable in fare such as this. He's just a big lug, endearing enough. And it's important here that he be endearing because in this movie it's obvious from the start that it's his Adam, not Portman's Emma, who is more open to the idea of love. You need to feel for Adam as he goes through the movie's tried and true romantic comedy formula ups and downs. Kutcher pulls off what is required of him. Portman meanwhile shows off a different side. After the dark, ultra-serious Black Swan it's nice to see her able to just cut loose and have some fun. This movie is certainly not uproariously hilarious but it has its funny moments and Portman plays her part, showing some comic chops. And of course she shows her vulnerability too because the rom-com formula demands it.<br/><br/>The arc of their respective careers has shown Portman to be clearly the more talented of the two leads in this movie. But Kutcher holds his own, he and Portman make a good match. The chemistry isn't perfect, the sparks never really fly. The movie tries to be raunchy at times but never really commits to it, ultimately the whole thing is a bit tame. No cinematic masterpiece to be sure but there are enough good moments to carry the film to respectability. All in all it's pretty good fun. The very simple story is spiced up a bit by some interesting supporting characters. Kevin Kline is a hoot as Adam's dad, a total cad. Lake Bell draws some laughs as an incredibly socially awkward woman who pines for Adam. Greta Gerwig, Mindy Kaling and Chris Bridges (yes, 'Ludacris') are among the others who wander in and out of the movie to provide a laugh or two. There's also a largely unrecognizable Cary Elwes who sadly gets absolutely nothing to do, a bit of a waste his casting was. Of course, as with all movies of this genre, the whole thing really rests on the shoulders of the lead couple. It's their movie. And Kutcher and Portman do enough to both entertain you and actually make you care about their characters. No Strings Attached is not a movie that rises above its genre, it doesn't stand out in any meaningful way. But for what it is it's not half bad."

"DICK STEEL","6","2","4","13 February 2011"," A Nutshell Review: No Strings Attached
","Trending is powerful. When an idea seemed viable, a series of films will get made, from end of the world stuff, to vampires and alien invasions, and it's even applicable to the romantic comedy genre. I wonder who came up with the recent thought about designing a film exploring the friends with benefits concept, and here we're faced with at least three of such films having Hollywood starlets in various stages of undress, from Love with Other Drugs, No Strings Attached milking the Valentine's Day weekend here, and soon Friends with Benefits starring Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis. Seems like f*ck buddies are getting mainstream acceptance with everyone jumping onto the same bandwagon in Tinseltown.<br/><br/>But more powerful than that, is the shift toward the alpha-female type of character, even if just for a while, laying the ground rules and setting the parameters in which a courtship, friendship and relationship should be based upon. Gone out the window are the demure and needy types, and in come female characters who know what they want, are high fliers, doing charitable causes and the likes, and just having the guys strung around their finger. Rudyard Kipling's ""... the female of the species is more deadly than the male..."" is steadfast here, where the only time the male characters are needed, is for that recreational purpose. They do not want commitment, nor settle down or want to be in a long term relationship, skipping past chances to get emotionally hurt, and prefer to keep things status quo in their singledom.<br/><br/>Ashton Kutcher goes against type since he's always the stud of any film and stars as Adam, an aspiring television screenwriter who has absolutely no luck with women, even having to suffer some loss of face with his ex-girlfriends preferring a relationships with his television star dad (Kevin Kline). Who is way older. But richer of course. Throughout his 15 years we see how he has this magnetic attraction for Emma (Natalie Portman) and vice versa, only that both of them fail to want to admit it, with Emma preferring a no-frills sexual relationship in lieu of a proper one that involves feelings. For a guy, I suppose this is something quite agreeable, so Adam goes for it.<br/><br/>While Love and Other Drugs got an M18 rating for its gratuitous nudity, this one was rated the same but had none of the showing of that much skin, only because it featured a pair of lesbians going at it while clothed. Both Adam and Emma only go at it like crazy jackrabbits in a montage, and other than that the narrative treaded on perfect rom-com ground, without quite the intelligent and interesting story that Love and Other Drugs had. Still, with Ivan Reitman (who makes a cameo too) at the helm, one would have thought that it may have offered at least something out of the ordinary, but no such luck as the film had it pat down right to the expected finale on how things would turn out in Hollywood.<br/><br/>If you think you've seen enough of Natalie Portman lately, think again. The current It girl who has been sweeping up awards for her Black Swan portrayal, she's having a busy 2011 as well with the upcoming Marvel summer blockbuster Thor and other films such as Your Highness and Cloud Atlas. While she and Kutcher share some delightful chemistry, being first of all good lookers is almost the requisite in any romantic film, the casting of the two who have such a difference in height also made it as passing jibes in the film, while you can't help but to notice some distracting camera angles being employed to make the difference none too jarring so that they can share the same frame, or perhaps Portman could have been standing on a soapbox.<br/><br/>Like one character said, we don't choose who we fall in love with, and we just do. That perhaps came out as one of the rare few times that you'll be nodding at some enlightenment, otherwise you'll be basking in some of the groaning bad innuendos and jokes, and wondering why the need for such a large supporting cast such as Cary Elwes, Ludicrous, Jake M.Johnson, Greta Gerwig, Lake Bell and Mindy Kaling all coming on as very rote caricatures. Sure it's good enough for that Valentine's Day lineup, but it's none too memorable once the lights come on, without the benefit of a strong story running parallel to the romance."
"abbyjsd","Null","2","4","1 February 2011"," Great Romantic Comedy!!
","This movie is about an extremely busy nurse who is looking for relationship that is strictly physical. They try to stay only sexual friends but it doesn't take long for their feelings for each other to grow into a love for one another. Ashton Kutcher's father falls in love with Ashton's ex- girlfriend and father and son don't speak for a while. The director chose a very conservative view on the physical interaction parts of the movie and uses a lot of humor to lighten the mood. There is a lot of sickening romance throughout the movie to make every woman in the world to fall in love with Ashton Kutcher's character. Natalie Portman is a great actress and shows her many talents of acting styles in this movie. She stayed serious throughout the romantic scenes and yet excelled in the comic aspects of the movie. I enjoyed this movie because of the romantic comedy atmosphere within a tangled relationship."
"Kamurai25","7","0","0","5 July 2020"," I wish this was a problem I had....
","Really good watch, would watch again, and can recommend.<br/><br/>Having just watch ""Friends with Benefits"" this feels like a drastically different movie: mostly on the basis that this is more about a neurotic woman's control issues extending into the fear of rejection and emotional pain. Not that it's wrong to be guarded in her manner, it's just that is what you call that.<br/><br/>Now, I've basically been in love with Natalie Portman since ""Leon: The Professional"", and have only liked Ashton Kutcher in ""Butterfly Effect"" (wildly polarized opinions on the movie) and ""A Lot Like Love"" (I hate baseball, and only seem to really like Amanda Peet in baseball themed video), so I had to ignore just being angry at him most of the movie.<br/><br/>The other significant difference between ""Friends with Benefits"" is that this has an amazing supporting cast, and a story past ""my crazy dad"". And in that support cast, there are examples of different types of women (and men) archetypes. Greta Gerwig was basically (eventually) the perfect woman, very appreciated, where Lake Bell was appreciative, but with ""quirks"", and either would have fine women / options if the world actually worked like that so reciprocate that appreciation if you have it.<br/><br/>But, of course, the story focuses on emotionally elusive control freak, and I'll admit a certain appeal to that. And the independent part of that is the appealing part, but how that character became an (almost) doctor and has it together is by avoiding the problems that she's having with Adam, and that only works so far when it's already there, which is what most of the movie is about: a woman being emotionally brave (there is no bravery without fear), and even thought it seems to be told from Adam's perspective (mostly), he doesn't have much going on other than sexing Emma in terms of adversity. The one thing that happens is quickly resolved because someone else wants to sex him, where as she is in a continuous state of confrontation.<br/><br/>While both movies have this light hearted air to them about the complexities of relationships ""Friends with Benefits"" almost seems cute compared to the adventures of this movie. Not everyone is going to deep dive on a movie like I will though, so I can't say this is a wildly great movie: it's still about pretty people having sex and complaining about it, so it loses some of the steam there."

Both plots are eerily similar but just like every other genre, if you succeed in using a similar formula, then what does it really matter? And technically this film came before 'Friends With Benefits'. Natalie Portman, who has truly become one of the greatest actors of this generation (and she's still under 40!), has great chemistry with fellow lead Ashton Kutcher, who expectedly begin to fall for each other after years of friendship. Much like the previously mentioned 'Friends With Benefits', the film is rounded out with a great cast of supporting actors, Greta Gerwig, Jake Johnson, Lake Bell, Ludacris, Mindy Kaling, and Kevin Kline.

"ironhorse_iv","5","0","0","21 April 2013"," I couldn't get attached with this movie. Too dumb and predictable.
","No chemistry at all. There is a hardly any chemistry between the two main characters in this Ivan Reitman's film. Emma (Natalie Portman) and Adam (Ashton Kutcher). These two actors can act, but this movie should have had two different leading actors who could be more vivid in their acting, like Justin and Mila in ""Friends with Benefits"" (2011) At least their faces were animated, they had chemistry, and they made the sex scenes very funny and easily watchable. I'm not saying that movie was great, but it's better than this movie. All we get is a bawdy comedy with a slow moving story in here. This movie just makes me depressed about how people view sex and relationships. So casual. So selfish. And we wonder why our culture is riddled with divorce and so many of us suffer from feelings of isolation and low self-worth. After first meeting at a summer camp as teenagers, Emma (Natalie Portman) and Adam (Ashton Kutcher) run into each other a few times when they're young adults but never manage to keep in touch, until Adam find out that his girlfriend was cheating on him with his dad (Kevin Kline). When Adam finds out he gets drunk and starts calling the women in his cell phone directory seeking a hookup with Emma. Emma proposal for a causal relationship or friends with benefits. He warns Emma that she'll fall in love with him, but she dismisses that idea and sets some ground rules to keep what they're doing from becoming too serious. I'm sure that you can guess how the main plot ends. They fall in love, they deny their love, they separate and they get back together. Nothing new added to already predictable rom-com genre besides the role reversal. Girl interested in sex but not commitment. Boy gets attached. Girl breaks up with boy then realizes error of her ways. Boy willingly takes her back. The important criticism is that the storyline is a quilt of ideas are recycled from other rom-com flicks with the use of clichés such as detachment and insecure. If you're in the mood for some boring, obnoxious, pretentious, shallow and tacky people and their petty problems, this is a movie made just for you. I found myself wondering why it was important that these small people, with their small thoughts and small problems should concern anyone. I don't find their love affair interesting nor did watching them help me with my own relationship. This movie is largely revolting for anyone who has any sensibilities about love, sex, and romance. The evident here is that it's not going to be possible to have a purely sexual relationship without any attached feelings, and we go into the story hoping for that redemptive lesson to come through. It finally does, but not until a lot of crude and lewd and nasty dialogue and visuals have taken place. People simply do not behave the way these pretty people all behave. Basically, the premise here is that people jump in and out bed without much, or any, thought and that the jumping is the subject of endless vulgar discussion over cocktails or dinner. Put another way, this film is vulgar nonsense. Nothing wrong with that if it is also entertaining, but really, this film is a clean miss. And when the lesson is learned at the end, it's half-hearted. These two don't belong with each other. The story line is nearly implausible, even for a rom-com. Transition between scenes is poor. Slow and boring. The best scenes are the doughnuts and period CD. The jokes are hit and miss. Off color and gay activity jokes was uncalled for and tasteless. Then there is the sex. The film had little nudity for sex comedy. I guess the R rating was due to the drug references because there sure wasn't any sexual chemistry between the stars. I don't mind it. Natalie Portman is still sexy to me, but if you want something better as far as a sex scene with a much better story then check out 2010 Black Swan. It doesn't have much nudity as well, but the sexuality tension is clearly noticeable in that, unlike here. I think it's because the film use the usual same camera angled sex scenes seen in every similar sex comedy movie. Ashton is pretty much Ashton in the film and doesn't give anything new to the role. Kevin Klein is just an unfunny old bag that indulges in depravity. How not funny. Old people being disgusting is awful. My second celebrity crush in this movie had to be Olivia Thirlby. Overall, it was the same when every other romantic comedy. Predictable dumb. This movie will be in the 1 dollar bin at Wal-Mart sooner than later."

"MovieManMenzel","6","3","9","24 January 2011"," Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher charm their clothes off in ""No Strings Attached""
","Adam (Ashton Kutcher) works as an assistant for a ""High School Musical"" type television show and is deeply in love with his girlfriend, Vanessa (Ophelia Lovibond). One day out of the blue, Vanessa tells Adam that she is leaving him because she isn't happy with his current lifestyle. To make matters even worst, Adam finds out that Vanessa left him for is his own father, Alvin (Kevin Kline). Now depressed and looking for affection, Adam turns to booze, his two best friends, and his cell phone as a way to relieve the pain. This is when Adam gets the brilliant idea to dial every woman in his phone book and try to convince one of them to sleep with him. After waking up from a drunken stupor, Adam finds himself in a apartment belonging to Emma (Natalie Portman), whom he has had a crush on since their summer at camp together. Happy to see her, Adam tries to pursue a relationship with Emma only to find out that she doesn't want to get involved in one. This is when the pair decides to try out a friends with benefits relationship with the hopes that neither of them begin to fall for one another. A surprisingly decent romantic comedy ensues...<br/><br/>After reading my plot description for the film, you are probably thinking to yourself that this can't possibly be good; it sounds so incredibly clichéd. While it is clichéd, the film itself is actually believable with real life scenarios. The fact that Portman's character Emma works in a hospital only helps with how believable the story is. I have friends who work in a hospital and I know how crappy their schedules can be. The fact that Emma has no time for relationships seems believable based on her career choice. Add on to the fact that Emma is afraid of commitment and being hurt only makes it more believable. A lot of the story works because of Emma. That's not saying that Ashton Kutcher's character didn't help the story because it did. Sure Adam was a nice guy but he was actually believable here. He worked as an assistant and not as some high profile role. He was just a normal everyday guy in this film and actually didn't seem like a cocky jerk or douche-bag like he normally comes off as in his previous films.<br/><br/>Along with believable human characteristics, Portman and Kutcher chemistry was the key element that made the film work. They have terrific chemistry with one another and even if you don't normally like Kutcher (like me) you can't help but admit he is likable here. The two play off one another from the get go and as the film goes on you can truly feel that these two people are in fact falling in love. Portman is extremely charming as Emma but also plays a very strong character, who believes she can truly take care of herself and doesn't need anyone. Her character here reminded me a lot like Anne Hathaway's character in ""Love and Other Drugs"" minus the illness subplot. I have met many women in my past who share a lot of the same characteristics that Emma had and the way Portman portrayed that role just added to it working.<br/><br/>While I had good things to say about the film, I also have some negatives. There were three elements about the film that really irked me. The first one was Kevin Kline, who I normally love as an actor, but he was a horrible miscast here. He just seemed out of place and his character just felt like an unnecessary filler. The next thing was the over abundance of sex jokes that seem to come flying out at the audience at a mile a minute pace. There were way too many of them and out of every 20 I would say about one or two of them worked. I get that this was a sex comedy, it's a film about two people having a friends with benefits relationship, but I don't need the jokes reinforcing that fact thrown at me every single minute. The last thing that really bugged me was the whole ""Judd Apatow Effect"" element of the film. I have mentioned this in a previous review but I hate when a film goes from a raunchy comedy to a romantic comedy with heart. To add to the typical ""Apatow effect"" there are usually a few best friend characters who seem to be there for plucky 'sexual remarks' comic relief. This film holds these qualities and I find this formula overused already. I didn't even see a point to Ludicrous (Wallace) even being in the film at all.<br/><br/>In the end, ""No Strings Attached"" is as predictable as it looks from the trailers but it doesn't end up being a complete disaster like one would expect. Portman and Kutcher both have great chemistry together and play realistic characters, which help make this simplistic and clichéd story work. While I feel this role is beneath Portman at this point in her career, it was nice seeing her play a role where she can have a little fun. I thought it was hilarious when Portman described Adam waving his penis around as well as the one-liners she spit out when the two played mini golf. Kutcher didn't make me a fan (at least not yet) but he did actually get me to enjoy him in a film. The film was enjoyable for what it was and provided some good laughs and some nice romance even with its flaws. I recommend this one to most who are looking for a decent date movie. It's definitely one of the better ones released from a major studio in the past few years.<br/><br/>MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""No Strings Attached"" is a 6.5 out of 10."

","OK I agree that the movie is predictable but what do you expect from Rom-Com's, they are meant to entertain you and this is what No Strings Attached does successfully . Its a cute love story overpowered with physical intimacy. The movie is definitely an entertainer with all the punches and funny situations which make you laugh. Ashton Kutcher and Natalie Portman (the odd couple) fits well together and especially Portman has done a really nice act. Soundtrack is good with some famous no's like Bleeding Love and 99 problems. There are certain liners which you will remember for long. Overall this movie is a great entertainer and deserves a watch."

","I thought this was pretty good. Sure, the ending was formulaic. What did you expect? The direction was unobtrusive, the photography good. Ashton Kutcher, who I had never seen in anything but a camera commercial, was okay. Not a de Niro, but doesn't claim to be, and didn't need to be. Some good good work from supporting cast members Ludicrous, Greta Gerwig, and Mindy Kaling. Lake Bell and Kevin Kline chewed just a bit too much scenery. I'm sure the director called for it, so it isn't a criticism of the acting. Natalie Portman was achingly pretty, and has decent comedic timing, something not all primarily dramatic actors have. A nice change for her after the swan thing."

","The best parts of the movie were, for me, all the scenes with Kevin Klein. Klein's character is hilarious and he plays it very well. The movie otherwise is, as most romantic comedies are, predictable; in this case, so very much so, but it's to be expected for the genre. I'm sure women love Ashton Kutcher for the handsome guy he is and the string of movies in which he's been portrayed as exactly that. Natalie Portman on the other hand has a broader portfolio of characters and her range has yet to find a limit so I suppose she can easily do eye candy stuff if she wants to; I would not object to that. I was hoping for more or less of her in this picture; you know exactly what I mean. <br/><br/>Kutcher and Portman appear to be having fun in their characters; I'd like to think they had fun making the movie as well. Good for them; good for us. I ponder the question no one has addressed yet Is this a chic flic? The ratings demographics indicate that it is so by a slim margin, so choosing the right words and conversation after the movie will be crucial to you guys hoping for your own happy ending. My advice is don't take my advice."

","""When Harry Met Sally"" has proved to be the moral template for most of today's romantic comedies, with the key classic statement: ""Men and women can't be friends because the sex thing always gets in the way."" In ""No Strings Attached"" Ashton Kutcher, who has become a sort of unofficial rom/com king, has finally realized a successful romantic conclusion after a series of poorly written film finales.<br/><br/>The jist of this film is simple and predictable. Kutcher and Natalie Portman were childhood friends who meet while in college and then later all in the space of 15 years.<br/><br/>Portman, who has emotional issues, only wants a sexual involvement, which Kutcher agrees to. Of course the obvious happens and leads to a romantic and happy conclusion.<br/><br/>There is also supporting help from Kevin Klein and Lake Bell.

"Hellmant","5","2","5","10 March 2011"," No substance attached!
","'NO STRINGS ATTACHED': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>Recent Oscar winner Natalie Portman stars in this raunchy rom-com about a couple of friends who decide to have a casual sexual relationship with 'no strings attached' in hopes it doesn't ruin their friendship. It co-stars the horribly miscast Ashton Kutcher in the male lead role and a handful of other minor celebrities in minor roles (like Kevin Kline and Cary Elwes). It's written by Elizabeth Meriwether and Michael Samonek and directed by Ivan Reitman (of 'GHOST BUSTERS', 'STRIPES', 'MEATBALLS' and 'TWINS' fame). The material is obviously beneath Reitman and it's odd that he would be interested in directing a film like this (although he is getting old). What's more unsettling is that Natalie Portman was interested in doing a film like this. Sure it's a hit at the box office and I'm sure she got a big paycheck but she usually sticks to more artistic fare or at least films with more substance than mediocre crap like this.<br/><br/>Portman plays a hospital resident named Emma who is afraid of commitment or any type of real reltaionship. Kutcher plays an aspiring film writer named Adam who's working as an assistant on a popular teen musical TV show. Adam's most recent girlfriend dumped him and started dating his father (Kline). Emma and Adam met as children and kept running into each other randomly throughout the course of their lives, every several years. One morning they decide to sleep together and Emma immediately enforces the rules that if they keep doing it, that's all it will ever be. As this goes on Adam keeps wanting more and things get complicated.<br/><br/>Portman's Emma character is pretty abusive to Kutcher's Adam and I think if the sex of the characters had been reversed this movie would not have gone over so well and have been seen as sexist. It's a new day and age though and the movie is primarily written by a woman from a woman's point of view. Even so the movie is mostly fluff and for the most part pretty poorly written. Reitman's directing does little to improve anything as well and is pretty uninspired. Kutcher is horrible as usual and brings the movie down even further. He should stick to supporting comedic roles because he's proved time and time again that he has no leading man acting chops. The chemistry between he and Portman is pretty bad as well and almost nonexistent. I keep wondering how the film might have turned out if they had cast a Jake Gyllenhaal or Shia LaBeouf. The material isn't good enough to warrant their involvement though and it's certainly beneath Portman. She's found her new status as Hollywood's most popular leading lady but just because she's holding a position once held by Julia Roberts and Sandra Bullock it doesn't mean she has to act like them. She's much better than that. She does do a decent acting job in the film none the less and looks breathtakingly beautiful (more so than possibly ever before). So if you're as big a fan of Natalie Portman as I am it's worth seeing just for that. Mostly a waste though.<br/><br/>Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVckRO-OANw"

","** out of (****)<br/><br/>Ivan Reitman's latest Hollywood cash cow, ""No Strings Attached"", looks like a humorous, offbeat comedy that'll make you chuckle here and there, and maybe tug on some heart strings (pun intended). You do get that here, but that's pretty much it. Don't get me wrong, this is a pretty decent film that just so happens to rise above the average rom-com, but given its potential, it could use a few tweaks. The film starts out as a slick comedy with some clever one-liners and an awkward tone, but as it progresses, it gets a little formulaic and then you think to yourself, didn't I see this before? See, this a tough film to review because I did enjoy the movie, and I understand Reitman's intentions, but I don't think he fully pulled off what he set out to do. I suppose you should venture out to see this movie if you have a date. It seems like any romantic comedy coming out in February will just be very dopey and syrupy. <br/><br/>No Strings Attached revolves around Adam (Kutcher) who's father is cheating on his ex- girlfriend. Meanwhile, Adam runs into the girl at a party that he met at camp when he was younger. Emma (Portman) decides to solve the problem with one key element: sex. So, Emma and Adam promise to have a physical relationship, but to limit themselves to friends. Kind of like friends with benefits. But, can they stay just friends? What if one is attracted to the other?<br/><br/>First off, the script is sharp. That's what makes this movie shine. The jokes are witty, to-the- point, and very funny. I laughed out loud here and there. It's definitely one of the funnier movies out there. Furthermore, the performers were solid. Portman can be sexy, hysterical, and charming all at the same time. Kutcher was surprisingly fun and just went along with the ride. The supporting characters also shined. The cast was just great. <br/><br/>Now the bad. While I loved Kutcher and Portman, I didn't really see any chemistry between the two. Maybe I missed something, but I didn't buy into it. Furthermore, the second half plays exactly like an American soap opera, just with a few funny gags thrown in there for good measure. Also, I thought the movie dragged a little toward the end. But I would prefer the film to run a little long than way too short. <br/><br/>All in all, ""No strings attached"" could've been worse. Thank God the characters this time around were charismatic, the script was well-written, and the gags packed a punch. However, given the talents behind the camera, the outcome should've been stronger. Nevertheless, this year doesn't stick out like a sore thumb. First, we had ""The Green Hornet"" which was a refresher in the action/comedy department. Now we have ""No strings attached"" which is a refresher (the first half anyway) in the rom-com department. I'd stick with a matinée or a rental on this one. It is worth seeing at least once.<br/><br/>Note: Also, couldn't this film been a PG-13? The sex was minimal, and even then, it was just quick cut-aways with no nudity, except for Kutcher's behind. Had some f bombs been excised, I can swear on it this film could've been a PG-13. It doesn't matter, just wanted to point that out."
"namashi_1","6","2","6","3 May 2011"," Decent Flick....
","Ivan Reitman's 'No Strings Attached' is a decent romantic-comedy, laced with charming performances by it's lead cast. Even the freshness attached to it, comes up as a sorta relief.<br/><br/>'No Strings Attached' stars Natalie Portman & Ashton Kutcher, as two friends who end up having sex one morning and begin to worry about their friendship being ruined. They then make a pact to have a 'No Strings Attached' relationship, that, to have casual sex without falling in love with each other.<br/><br/>The idea is fresh, and the writing in the first hour, especially, is interesting & enjoyable. But, like every other romantic-comedy, the second hour suffers from the usual clichés. However, the freshness in the first-hour doesn't let it's impact go a miss completely. Ivan Reitman's direction is fine. Cinematography is good. Editing is fair.<br/><br/>Performance-Wise: Portman & Kutcher, both, are equally charming. Portman gets it right from the very beginning, and doesn't fail to impress, yet again. Kutcher, like always, gets his timing spot-on. In the supporting cast, Kevin Kline gets very limited scope. He deserved more footage. Greta Gerwig is alright. Lake Bell is extremely natural. Cary Elwes is hardly there.<br/><br/>On the whole, 'No Strings Attached' is a decent watch."

","Emma (Natalie Portman) has always been on the reserved side, not comfortable with wearing her emotions on her sleeve. Even at sleepaway camp, where she first meets Adam (Ashton Kutcher), she has a difficult time consoling him when he admits his parents are divorcing. Later, when they meet again at a college frat party, she fails to extend a strong gesture of friendship toward Adam, despite their attraction for each other. Unbelievably, they meet a third time, when Emma moves to Los Angeles to complete her residency. Talk about fate! At this point, Adam's own father (Kevin Kline) has stolen away his former girlfriend and, once again, needs a hug or two. So, Emma puts forth an ""agreement"" between these two very comely folks. Could they just sleep together, no commitments, until someone better comes along for Adam? Or, until one of them starts to ""feel"" more strongly about a future relationship, when they can end it? Adam, who is still lovesick, agrees. Because Emma's schedule is so complicated, they meet for trysts at the drop of a hat. Sex is great. But, with Adam's friends (one is Ludicrous) giving him advice and a co-worker, Lucy (Lake Bell) showing interest in Adam, too, will he be the first to leave Emma behind? And, what about the arrogant young doctor who blithely tells Adam that Emma is his? This is quite a nice romantic comedy but its R rating, for language and sexual content, may not sit well with some viewers. As the tentative lovebirds, Portman and Kutcher are wonderful and so, so attractive. Kutcher, especially, gives a more understated performance than his usual goofball stuff, which is touching. The supporting cast of Kline, Ludicrous, Bell, Cary Elwes, and others is topnotch as well. The California setting is lovely, the costumes are terrific, and the camera work, script, and direction have plenty of style and smarts. In short, dear romcom fans, say yes to No Strings Attached very soon. Drag along others who are skeptical, too, for they will also like it."

Imagine saying to Kutcher when they're young adults: Come with me tomorrow.

The only thing movies like this do is to encourage young people to be promiscuous and to have completely unrealistic concepts about sex and relationships. If you live your life according to this movie's philosophy I guarantee you'll wind up miserable and your life won't have a ""fairy tale"" ending. Life is only like this for half a second.

"sddavis63","3","1","2","29 July 2012"," Pointless And Very Predictable
","I will give this movie credit for this: it did actually make me chuckle a few times. There are some amusing moments in it as Emma and Adam (Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher) try to sort out their relationship. Having met as teenagers at a camp, they've reconnected as adults and become ""friends with benefits"" - a euphemism, of course, for two people having sex with each other without any commitment. It's hardly an earth shaking premise. It is very much about sex, sex and more sex, and it's very predictable. You know that eventually these two are going to fall for each other in spite of their ""no commitment"" commitment, and you guess that in some way they're going to overcome all the obstacles and end up together. So the few chuckles that I did get out of this were very necessary to make the movie bearable.<br/><br/>One extra point for it is that there is a twist in this. It's not Emma who falls for Adam; it's Adam who falls for Emma and Emma who tries to brush him off at first. That's a gender role reversal, of course, which I guess also gave this a little bit of flavour that it wouldn't otherwise have had. On the downside, it's burdened with characters (mostly the secondary one but also Emma and Adam to an extent) that you really have trouble caring about. Sure I wanted the two of them to get together, but that was mostly because it would signal the end of the movie. (3/10)"
"Polaris_DiB","4","1","2","14 August 2011"," Unsupported
","Do you consider A Lot Like Love and Guess Who to be classics of rom-com cinema? We're in Ashton Kutcher as lead-man territory. The romantic sensibilities are the same in all of these movies, Kutcher's goofy exterior and sensible interior somehow hits a perfect note of completely dull. He's at his best when put into awkward situations that he tries to slip his way out of, but there is not a whole lot of that here.<br/><br/>Right then. So the story is about how nobody can be friends with benefits, and comedy ensues. Except these two are jealous coy lovers nearly from frame one (the first fifteen minutes or so goes through their back history of meeting in which even just seeing each other with potential relationships makes both of them look sad panda) and so what it's really about is Portman's character Emma trying to get over a crippling and aggressive fear of commitment. The territory in which to explore this is vast, and the scenes that actually do all work just fine. For some reason I have no real comprehension of, the movie engineers as many ways as possible of refusing to acknowledge its own core dramatic element. Probably the most egregious deviation is this completely random rival for Emma's affections, whose presence is so insignificant to the plot that you're practically editing him onto the cutting room floor in your own brain while you're watching him do his Snidely Whiplash thing. Homeboy's around for maybe three scenes and not a one of them is believable, the absolute worst being when he challenges Adam and says that Emma will be all over him after leaving Adam, without enough provocation and any true indication of Emma's interest. This whole folderol set up was meant to put a jealousy element into the movie that was already there and not in need of elaboration from a completely unbelievable and unnecessary side villain, who gets dropped the second the camera looks away and only returned back later to be literally left hanging, looking around, wondering what the heck to do and why he's in this movie.<br/><br/>Then there's the subplot about Adam's relationship to his father which works to move forward some important plot points, but manages to do nothing to develop Adam's character. The father is there to provide a couple reasons for getting closer to Emma so that their relationship doesn't stay static, but eventually the father gets regulated to ""Well if you love her fight for her"" territory. Seriously this movie spent more time ignoring its own actual premise than working through it.<br/><br/>Also, this couple actually wants each other forever from nearly every frame after the long expository flashbacks, so most of the movie is a matter of waiting around for Emma to come around. This could be frustrating but to be fair, so is being in that situation. To be realistic, the Emmas of our lives tend not to come around, and so this movie ultimately ends up playing off like the protracted pre-sleep wish fulfillment fantasy of the recent relationship reject trying to convince himself, ""She'll come around eventually.... she'll come around eventually.... she'll come around eventually..."" This is one of those movies that had just enough elements that it could have become about a million other interestingly realized movies, but the actual movie it resulted in is hardly worth saving. There's even one of those rom-com final lines before the relationship is consummated that was engineered for some nonexistent much better other movie to become a classic of heart-thumping cinema, but was unfortunately left in this movie instead.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"
"TxMike","Null","1","2","10 June 2011"," Profane in its concept, even the ""cute"" actors don't make this a worthwhile film.
","There was a time not long ago when dialog in movies pointed you to what might be happening, and the rest was formed in your own mind. You could make it as clean or as profane as you wanted. Not anymore, even the cute blond 20-something script writer for this movie spells everything out, with very base descriptions of body parts and body functions. It may work for teenagers but it doesn't work for thoughtful adults. It makes the whole movie come across as profane and dirty just for the sake of ""dirty.""<br/><br/>Then there is the overall concept, that it is just fine and normal for two long-time friends, now adults, to just hook up for casual sex any time either of them is horny, because that serves the same function as a good bowel movement when you are bloated. I am disappointed that fine actors chose to play these roles. The critic Ebert has an excellent review.<br/><br/>The girl is Natalie Portman as Emma and the guy is Ashton Kutcher as Adam. The best role however is Kevin Kline as Adam's dad, Alvin, who ends up hooking up with Adam's most recent ex-girlfriend. <br/><br/>I may be one of the few who recognized Cary Elwes in the low-key role of Dr. Metzner. Although he is nearing 50, with his youthful features and a light beard his character could pass for 35.<br/><br/>Not a very good movie at all, but those who enjoy profane comedic situations will likely enjoy this. <br/><br/>SPOILERS: Naturally Emma and Adam cannot go on forever with a no-commitment, casual sex arrangement. She is afraid to commit to anyone, but he loves her. When he expresses his love and she retreats, he calls it quits. But eventually she misses him too much and they end up together, happily ever after."

","Guy falls for girl. Girl just wants to have sex. Girl falls for guy but doesn't realize it and screws it up. Girl tries to fix things. Girl and guy fall in love at the end. This plot can be used for 85% of the romantic comedy films that are out there today. Just switch the who falls for who part first and you have your movie. You need one aspect of the film that makes it different and gives the viewer a reason for wanting to see it. This film's reason? Two attractive people using each other for sex. Let the fun begin. <br/><br/>No Strings Attached has the benefit of coming out before the carbon copy that is Friends With Benefits. The exact same plot line about people using each other for sex, which causes problems. The dueling films have a bit of irony to them. Natalie Portman stars in No Strings Attached and Mila Kunis stars in Friends With Benefits. So it looks like the duel for the spotlight from Black Swan isn't over and these two films make round 2. <br/><br/>No Strings Attached is Ivan Reitman's first R rated comedy since Stripes. The reason the film is rated R is because they use the F-Word a dozen times. Did that make the film funnier? Not really. If a film is rated R for the language, than I think it should use that to the film's advantage, this film didn't do that. The only bits of comedy that I enjoyed were the scenes with Kevin Kline, who plays Ashton Kutcher's father. He's a famous guy who had one successful show and catchphrase. His success draws the attention of one hot young lady, who coincidentally is Kutcher's ex-girlfriend. This revelation sends Kutcher on a drunken spree where he finds himself waking up naked on Portman's couch. They then decide to have sex and use each other for sex whenever, wherever. <br/><br/>There is a bit of conflict with this one guy who claims to be the type of guy that Portman would marry, while Kutcher is only the type of guy she has sex with in secret. This drama is never explored, it sets itself up to be nothing in the end. There have been quite a bit of films as of late that follow the trend of the female wanting to use the male for sex while he yearns for something more. Love & Other Drugs did the exact same thing, the problem with that film was that it couldn't balance comedy and drama very well. No Strings Attached has problems finding comedy to balance. <br/><br/>Portman is cute, as always. Kutcher is goofy, as always. The supporting cast outshines the main cast, as always. I didn't care if they ended up together in the end. I didn't care about their fights and I didn't care about the hot sex they would have. I simply did not care for this movie. It's clichéd, generic, cookie-cutter, whatever you want to call it. It's a film that you have seen a dozen times before. The question you need to ask yourself is does the prospect of Kutcher and Portman having nonstop sex interest you?"

","Greetings again from the darkness. If you have read even a few of my reviews, you know I am not typically a fan of the Hollywood Rom-Com. I find most of them lazy, lame, predictable and irritating. But when legendary comedy director Ivan Reitman (Ghostbusters, Dave, Stripes) gets involved, I will at least pay attention. Here Mr. Reitman directs a script that on the surface will examine the Friends with Benefits phenomenon.<br/><br/>The leads are played by Ashton Kutcher and Natalie Portman, and the twist here is that Portman's Emma is the driving force behind the agreement with Kutcher's Adam to not have a relationship ... only relations. Even Adam's friends point out to him that he is living every male's fantasy. So does anyone think this will really work? Of course not.<br/><br/>First, they are both just so darn cute! And Adam is oh-so-adorable as the sly one hoping to break through and convince Emma that he is worthy of her love. All the physical stuff continues as Adam works his job on the set of a Glee knock-off, battles with his dad (Kevin Kline) who is sleeping with Adam's ex-girlfriend (a wonderful Opehlia Lovibond), and Emma slaves away saving lives in her job as a brilliant doctor. Oh, and one of Adam's co-workers (a manic Lake Bell) has a mega crush on him, and Emma's little sister (Olivia Thirlby) finds true love as does Emma's friend Patrice (Greta Gerwig from Greenberg), who falls for Adam's best friend. Wow. All that love and our two heroes just have to keep things between the sheets.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the side stories are enough fun that the film is easily watchable despite the predictable nature of the premise. Even the Portman/Kutcher story is tolerable thanks to the gender-bending nature of their roles. I would have preferred to see the Friends with Benefits pact extended and examined (it worked in the Stieg Larsson books!). This is easily Mr. Reitman's best comedy since 1993's ""Dave"", which also featured Kevin Kline. It's nice to see Ms. Portman do something lightweight after her fabulous ""Black Swan"" performance, but I am really hoping Mr. Kutcher understands that someday he may really have to act and not just smile on cue."

","I love Natalie Portman. I love Natalie Portman. I love Natalie Portman. Ever since Closer (for quite obvious reasons) she has had my attention, but she is one of these actors that captivate anyones attention, without ever having to say a word. She truly is one of the most beautiful women on the planet.<br/><br/>Now let me stop obsessing over her, and talk about the film No Strings Attached. Adam (played by Ashton Kutcher) has just suffered the humiliation of finding out that his ex girlfriend has dumped him for his own father, and ends up contacting every girl in his phonebook until one of them agrees to have sex with him. This leads him back to an old school friend Emma (Natalie Portman). Although too drunk to go through with his intention in the evening, the morning after he and Emma decide to get it on as there is an instant connection. As Emma is a resident at a nearby hospital so therefore has no time for any kind of relationship, and has a history of not being able to let people get close to her, she decides that a friends with benefits situation is best for her. Adam obviously agrees to this (ermmmm who wouldn't?) and the story leads from there. <br/><br/>Obviously if you have watched any Rom-Com in the last 20 years you will know exactly what happens at the end of this film, but i have to say this film definitely has a freshness to it. The supporting cast (including Kevin Kline, Jake M Johnson (New Girl), and the very funny Lake Bell) help to boost the Com part of Rom-Com, which i always feel helps when the Rom part doesn't have anything majorly unique included in the storyline. <br/><br/>All in all, a very decent Rom-Com acted by two very attractive actors (yes, even though i am a man, i am confident in myself enough to admit that Ashton Kutcher is annoyingly attractive) If it was a choice between this or Friends with Benefits, i would watch both even though they are pretty much the exact same film. Then again, if you take away the characters and look at the story lines of most Rom-Coms, aren't they all the same story???<br/><br/>Thank you for reading :)<br/><br/>P.S I love Natalie Portman."

Nothing seems forced or contrived, and it just flows. The movie works with topics that concern our generation and looks at how life really is for many people. Many of us find that we can relate to these characters and the situations that they are going through, and we see that we're normal and get a laugh out of it.

","No Strings Attached is a romantic comedy film starring Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher together with Cary Elwes and Kevin Kline.Elizabeth Meriwether's screenplay is about two friends that decide to make a pact to have sex with ""no strings attached"".The film is directed by Ivan Reitman.<br/><br/>In this romantic comedy,Emma and Adam are life-long friends who almost ruin everything by having sex one morning. In order to protect their friendship, they make a pact to keep their relationship strictly casual or ""no strings attached."" that means no jealousy, no expectations, no fighting, no flowers, no baby voices. It means they can do whatever they want, whenever they want, in whatever public place they want, as long as they don't fall in love. Can you have sex without love getting in the way? And can their friendship survive?Your guess is as good as mine in the end.<br/><br/>The movie disappoints in a way that it presents an original idea but does not follow through in the end as it concludes in a clichéd and predictable way just like most romcoms. It benefits from the presence of the talented Natalie Portman despite her lack of chemistry with Ashton Kutcher due to not being on level with the former in terms of acting capabilities.Worse,the theme presented isn't really that modern as people already were into casual sex back in the 1970's.Too bad that the film decided to end to everyone's expectations.But nevertheless,it remains entertaining due to Portman's presence alone."

She decides to live her life and feels she doesn't deserves true happiness with a man. Then here comes the sensitive man who just is looking for true love.

I'm a huge Michigan Wolverine fan, so as the movie goes into the second scene with the lead male character at a Michigan frat party, It intrigued me to stay with the movie. Then of course with its crude humor and the awkward character that Ashton plays, this is a movie that showed promise. The love story was written well, and even though you know the outcome going into the movie, it was worth it. There are a few great lines from the movie, at times the movie slows down and it feels like it should end sooner. The one liners and the humor makes up for it.<br/><br/>In my B.S.

","What if your friends step in and say you might be a hopeless fool to pass up what you have despite how unconventional it appears? Yet, those tingling little jitters aren't there, that is unless you're afraid to confront them or are purposely pushing them away.<br/><br/>Fifteen years ago Adam (Kutcher) tried to get a little somethin' somethin' at summer camp with an emotional ruse about his parents getting divorced but was deflected from the unaffectionate Emma (Portman). Adam and Emma by chance catch each other five years ago at a frat party and she invites him to her father's funeral as if it's just some ""stupid thing."" He shares that he likes her but she's again upfront that they probably won't ever see each other. Now, one year ago they stumble into each other for the third time and he gets her phone number. From a drunken stupor about finding out that his dad is with someone he knows, he ends up at her place naked, thus starting their physical, get-in-get-out, wham-bam-thank-you-mam entanglement that comes with no strings attached, rules and boundaries included to make sure of it.<br/><br/>This is a comedy first and foremost, though it begins a little too headstrong and in the audience's face as there's no build up to the point-blank jokes. It's incredibly self-aware of its own ridiculousness and it becomes forced at times. Though after meeting more characters and getting an outline, this handles the unabashed and crude humor a little better as it turns over to the relationship angle. Despite the R rating--which is more for drug use and cursing--this takes a PG-13-like route about the physical side and doesn't exploit the angle such as provocative pictures like ""9 1/2 Weeks"" or the more extreme ""9 Songs"" as it's a little more fun and goofy than seductive. ""No Strings Attached"" also transitions between phases of growth as they continue to see each other more frequently to the point of appreciating one another and liking the stability--yet still don't use those no, no words like ""girlfriend"" and ""boyfriend."" <br/><br/>This starts wild and crazy and then lessens down to a mildly serious simmer that leaves the characters both torn between regretful decisions and emotional tangles. If it's not obvious enough this is going to get a little sappy for the hopefully romantic and everybody's going to end up some kind of winner no matter if it's how they planned it or even if it is who they thought it would be with. But that should have been expected from the humorous angle, as there's nothing dark or racy about this. Sometimes even coming with hip and trendy music and playing on the immature angle despite everyone's age.<br/><br/>""No Strings Attached"" on its surface is an easy movie that's made to be briefly rewarding and give a momentary good feeling when the credits roll. It comes with some challenges for the skeptics, such as how it deals with that coincidental thing called ""Fate"" that relationship movies abuse too often with all too convenient scenarios. Yes, this definitely has them--stumbling into each other at the coffee shop and all--but they're a little more buried than the normal formula as some complications arise and time is spread out. This borrows some conventions, as well as goes against a few, such as the guy being the fonder one despite growing up with an absent mother but instead a playboy, celebrity dad who chases tail.<br/><br/>The co-stars range from token black and gay guy, to socially awkward for the sake of quirkiness if we cinema goers haven't seen enough of it. The sister adds the element of marriage and the alpha male co-worker poses a threat by attempting to step in. Despite the clichés, some of the specific scenarios promote easy beguilement to the storyline even if they don't tally up enough to make this a classic down the road. Natalie Portman plays Emma by going through a few different phases from emotionless and direct to sentimental and confused. Her character development feels a little up and down as she attempts to transition back and forth till she's an adapted person, which makes the tone of the picture go from dealing with a risqué subject, to a rom-com, to reevaluating herself by searching for answers. There's not much to anticipate from Ashton Kutcher's role as he plays Adam with a big heart, which makes him spontaneous, giving and sometimes a little slow on the upkeep and spaced out, which gives him that teddy bear persona that he consistently carries from movie to movie."

","In 1989, the classic rom-com ""When Harry Met Sally"" posed the question of whether a guy and a gal could just be friends without sex getting in the way. A little over two decades later, ""No Strings Attached"" asks whether they can just have sex without love taking over. Of course, we are now in the age when so many rom-coms are much more sexually explicit and here we have an excessive number of references to body parts and sexual activity. Yet there is very little visual explicitness and the only naked body on show is male.<br/><br/>Diminutive (5' 3"") Natalie Portman is obviously trying to do something totally different from her intense role in ""Black Swan"" as Emma, a doctor with commitment issues, and, pretty though she is, this is not a natural role for her. Tall (6' 2"") Ashton Kutcher is more at home as Adam, an aspiring television writer who is originally willing to go along with the sex-only partnership. Like ""When Harry Met Sally"", ""No Strings Attached"" is written by a woman (Elizabeth Meriwether) and directed by a veteran of comedy films (Ivan Reitman) but it is not in the same class, while still being moderately funny and engaging."

For me, Natalie Portman is the best actress around. I absolutely love her. Ashton Kutcher is one the best comedian and charismatic actors around. He is confident, good-looking and -talking, so it's a near perfect match. Although the subject in the movie is very much about sex, we actually see few scenes of actual sex on screen. But it doesn't decrease the value of the movie. What can I say is that, if there would be any other two stars on the screen, the movie would get a lower rating from me, but as I said, they have picked the best bits.<br/><br/>Ashton Kutcher will almost certainly be remembered as Michael Kelso from the famous TV-series.

It was just stupid humor that was easy to understand. One thing I thought gave this movie something ""meat-on-the- bones"" was the fact that it was ""guy"" funny. Most people could relate to at least one character in the story making it a win for everyone. To be perfectly honest there was no deeper meaning to the characters or the plot it ran on. It was a light-hearted and easy going film made to entertain on a long Sunday afternoon. Then again maybe I'm just to picky. I would recommend just checking it out if you have the time.

Portman has done No Strings Attached and Your Highness aside from her amazing drama Black Swan. Cage has done pretty much anything else since Leaving Las Vegas, most of it being bland and goofy films that showcase his oddball sense of direction and hairstyles.<br/><br/>No Strings Attached is a romantic comedy, that at first seems like a different film making the characters shy away from romance and love, when ultimately we know what will happen. It doesn't take a genius to find out that Ashton Kutcher and Natalie Portman wind up together at the end of the film. Did you expect anything different? Movies like this are nice to watch, and most of the time keep a positive feel. But they are ruined by the inevitable outcome all of these movies have. The plot revolves around a medical student named Emma (Portman) and a TV executive named Adam (Kutcher). Both were the teenagers that knew each other, but never spoke in school and now they are starting to hang out more and talk with each other.<br/><br/>Emma is a workaholic and Adam just says ""yes"" to everything. When Emma says their relationship will be a sort of FWB style bond, Adam agrees and they have random sex on on/off occasions. Then they start feeling things for each other, we get a bunch of lovey-dovey between the two, and so on.<br/><br/>There are little perks to this movie. Jennifer Irwin has a minor role as one of the Television directors. I appreciated Irwin's work as Aunt Linda on the sitcom Still Standing, and she still doesn't seem like she changed her personality in this. Ashton Kutcher and Natalie Portman play a likable and cute couple side by side. Kutcher cleans up his act a little, and Portman has some fun with her character being a little foul-mouthed and outspoken. And we do get some cute dialog between them as well.<br/><br/>The R rating isn't as R as I would've thought. It's a questionable, high-maintenance PG-13 movie with a few dirty words. The sex scenes are extremely clean and are only suggestive. No Strings Attached is bumped up by a few smiles brought on by the cast and the dialog, but the plot and overall execution is just another, we-know-it-before-we-see-it sort of turnout. I expected a bit more daring acts from Kutcher and Portman together. Kutcher is a good actor in good movies, and Portman is on the rise to be an A list star. They only give their very early performance like skills in this film when they are so much more.<br/><br/>Starring: Ashton Kutcher, Natalie Portman, Greta Gerwig, Jake M.

At least she can hold some of the emotional scenes - UNLIKE her counterpart.<br/><br/>Ashton Kutcher's one-trick-pony acting style leaves this relationship in love purgatory. He couldn't shed an honest tear if his acting life depended on it. The viewer is just left with this feeling that his character has no feeling... for her... or for the audience. We needed his character to show some of the emotion that Portman had little trouble with. Ashton's only job here is to smile and run around half naked for a third of the movie.<br/><br/>Some of the supporting roles were nice additions both for their performances and their place in the story/script.<br/><br/>This was obviously a big budget production with a veteran director, but unfortunately Kutchers emotionless performance robs this romantic-comedy of the romance. That characteristic alone is enough of a serious flaw to drastically drop my score here.

","Ah, romantic comedies, hit or miss with me. But I tell you, it was Natalie Portman's year, like with most actresses coming up with an Oscar nod or win, they get the over exposure with romantic comedies around their performance of a lifetime. I was questioning if this looked like a good film or not, Ashton Kutcher is an alright leading man, definitely not in the same league as Natalie, but I was willing to give it a shot. No Strings Attached while does follow the same formula as most romantic comedies is actually better than most. I liked that for once the girl pushes away vs. the guy who is always insecure to get into a relationship, most girls in romantic comedies are portrayed as psycho stalkers who cannot live without their man, it's just insulting. Though predictable, the characters are likable and that's what makes this movie worth the watch.<br/><br/>Emma and Adam are two friends who keep bumping into each other after years apart from each other. Emma and Adam meet again through their mutual friend Patrice, when Emma is a resident in a local hospital and Adam is the assistant on a High School Musical like show, with aspirations of becoming a script writer. Adam becomes distraught when he learns that his eccentric father is having a relationship with Adam's ex-girlfriend. Determined, Adam starts calling every woman in his cell phone. The next day, he wakes up after a drunken night to find out that he text-messaged Emma and came to the home she shares with some other residents. Emma leads Adam to her bedroom to retrieve his pants, when the two of them wind up having sex. Because Emma does not believe in love Emma proposes that they have casual sex with each other, setting some ground rules for each other to prevent their relationship from becoming too serious. At first things go well, but then Adam starts becoming jealous of the possibility of Emma being with another doctor. Although denying that he is jealous, Adam starts presenting her with gifts. Then when he starts to take her advice and tries to move on, then she starts to get bit by the jealousy bug as well.<br/><br/>Like I said there are flaws, the ending does cop out a little bit I think and Ashton Kutcher's character is written a little too good to be true on the boyfriend level. But I have to admit these are very good looking people and if a guy had Natalie Portman I'm pretty sure he wouldn't want to let her go like girls wouldn't let go of Ashton, so I might be wrong on that level. Also Natalie's character really didn't need the cliché friends that every romantic comedy has, I mean if you're a doctor, are you honestly going to have 5 roommates? I can understand one roommate, but 5? But that's real nit picking and obnoxious, so I'll let that go, because I have to say that this was an enjoyable movie. Who said I can't like romantic comedies? Well I did, but No Strings Attached held it's own and I would recommend this if you're looking for a cute movie for the night.<br/><br/>7/10"

This is a bad movie!<br/><br/>I just recently watched ""Love & Other Drugs"" and my first thoughts were that it was a porno flick with a plot, but then it progressed to a representation of someone's struggle with relationships due to her health condition. So there was a very nice psychological content for me to play with and get my mind off the sexual content. So ""No Strings Attached"" kind of follows the same premise, but it never develops into a grown up subject because it keeps its very dumb sense of humor as the biggest priority.<br/><br/>Yet again, if drunkenness - badly played, by the way - and references to ones genitals are your idea of a good laugh, then it's fine. If you favor other things, then stay away."

","While going into this movie I knew that it wasn't going to be great, as most of these types of movies are never great. However, as most movies such as this, I figured I'd get a few laughs in and perhaps a feeling of giddiness. Well, that didn't happen. The movie started off raunchy, and awkward and for the most part it continued this way. Toward the middle of the movie I was just completely disgusted by the jokes and was just waiting for it to end. The movie was just all wrong. I should have probably known that it was going to be this way, because it seems as when an actor/actress wins an Oscar the next movie they are in is completely a miss."

","Adam (Ashton Kutcher) and Emma (Natalie Portman) agree to meet at mutually convenient times in order to have recreational sex without the inconvenience of an actual relationship confusing things. The only thing is that he was much in love with her when the arrangement started, whereas she has assorted hangups which make her phobic towards any sort of commitment. However, being as this story is situated firmly in rom-com land (albeit the modern version, which is rife with explicit language and raunch), we know from the start that it is only a matter of time.<br/><br/>And so, with little surprise, it pans out. But that doesn't really matter. Nearly all the characters here are good company, and even those who aren't that pleasant (Adam's initial girlfriend Vanessa (Ophelia Lovibond), for instance) are at least amusing.<br/><br/>There are few big laughs (although a sequence involving flatmates whose menstrual cycles coincide did draw laughter from women in the audience), but the movie is gently amusing throughout. Kutcher and Portman have a pleasing chemistry, and several of the supporting characters have some solid moments (Kevin Kline's has-been TV star Dad is particularly good fun).<br/><br/>There are no surprises anywhere to be seen, but I liked this movie nonetheless."

","No Strings Attached is an enjoyable romantic movie. Natalie Portman plays role of emotionally stunted Emma, who is training to be a doctor. She has neither time nor inclination for romantic pursuits. When she does gets entangled with Adam, an aspiring script writer, it is Emma who insists on Sex without Romance. Quite an inversion, as it is mostly the guys who are have an aversion to romance, but understandable considering her chosen career path.<br/><br/>No Strings Attached has enough of funny moments but I won't go so far to bill it as a romantic comedy. It is more of a romantic movie with funny moments. Both the leads have done a really good job, making the movie immensely watchable."
"KineticSeoul","6","1","4","20 May 2011"," Formulaic, but a decent romantic comedy...Just a bit overrated
","The trailer of this movie didn't hype me up at all to see it immediately, but overall it's a decent romantic comedy. It's formulaic in some aspects and goes in a direction where Ashton constantly brags about his features without proof to the audience. Which might be a good thing for guys but it kinda shows why he wanted to be in this movie, because of the dialogue that hypes him up. The plot is about a guy who is looking for a relationship with the girl he likes, but the girl just wants a sex friend. Also some guy audiences might be disappointed cause it shows Ashton being more revealing than Natalie Portman, in fact there is no nude scenes for her because she is under a contract or something. Overall it's a decent comedy, not all that funny and is overrated a bit by some reviewers in my opinion, but still a decent romantic comedy...Nothing all that special. The flaw of this movie is the formulaic and very predictable direction and parts and dialogue that is just not believable at all. Also the pacing of the movie slows down after the first hour. The main positive thing about this movie is that the two characters are relateable in some aspects.<br/><br/>6.5/10"

"montera_iulian","6","1","4","21 February 2011"," ""Love and Other Drugs"", all ""Spread"" around.
","Ivan Reitman, the director known for his long collaboration with Bill Murray, gave me enough reasons to worry about this flick only by the look of the trailer. No Strings Attached looked just like another cheap and average romantic comedy full of glam scenes and clichés. Is it the case here? Yes, it probably is. But something changed my judgment on this movie right after I left the theater. I said to myself: ""wait a minute, this movie ain't that bad so I need to write about it as soon as I could"". Well, here I am.<br/><br/>The film starts horrifying and amateurish. Nothing connects me with the characters, nothing impresses me, the jokes are so lame that even a true ""blond"" won't laugh at them, the pacing is incredibly boring and the clichés are falling like the ""bieber-tears"". I was obviously panicked. However, there was a point were things started to get better. The movie started to awake itself from the coma. Everything started to make sense again. I was breathing because the air was fresh. The film actually started to get entertaining. Well, thank god because that's what I was expecting from this. I expected a simple combo between ""Love and Other Drugs"" and Kutcher's other ""playboy"" film ""Spread"". This mixture is the perfect description this movie could have: ""Love and Other Drugs, All Spread Around"".<br/><br/>Basically the film is more than simple. Two friends, Emma (Natalie Portman) and Adam (Ashton Kutcher) become sex-buddies. Of course you know the twist here... C'mon guys... they fall in love. But that doesn't ruin anything because this is a great dating movie. There are a lot of goofy situations because you have Kutcher's same character, there are a lot of romantic moments which may seem to be similar or even identical to any other one thousand romantic moments which you all seen in other movies but that won't bother you because the execution is not wrong this time. So, you have the formula, you got the execution, what's next? The acting... While Kutcher does what he knows to do best, goofing around and run after girls, talk to the phone or eat a stake, Natalie Portman is too good for a movie like this. She gives a great performance even though it was not necessarily required. The emotions, the different emotional states, the delivery is better than I expected. That made me feel good and acknowledge that at least I could find interest in a character.<br/><br/>The technical execution is not something to be worry about so I won't talk about it since it's nothing special but I will admit though that the chosen songs were pretty good and they fitted the movie's identity. Excepting the first 20 minutes were everything was a complete chaos, a utterly mess, No Strings Attached starts horrifying but ends up more than satisfying. It's definitely a date film that I recommend. It's funny, cheesy, sweet to look at and strangely enough, innocent. Just don't hate on it."

","i usually don't watch stuff like this. do chicks watch stuff like this? who watches stuff like this? i dunno but i'm in a relationship with someone who adores Ashton Kutcher, so to be nice i watched this. can't say i was real impressed except for the fact that it was a little more likable than i expected it to be.<br/><br/>normally i'd say i'm the wrong person to review a movie like this, it's really not my kind of thing, but i told myself that i would commit myself to writing on every movie i watched no matter how old or innocuous it may be. it's a therapy thing. but i'm at a loss for words when things get this unimportant and superficial. here it goes.<br/><br/>Ivan Reitman directed this? really. he's obviously getting old. 'Stripes' is one of my favorite comedies of all time and i find it hard to fathom someone who directed a movie with such kick to it directed a light weight marshmallow like this.<br/><br/>i tried hard to pay attention to the storyline at the expense of my brain turning into mushy drivel. the pay off wasn't half bad. it actually had a little something to say and wasn't without a certain amount of self reflection. mostly i don't like the kind of people that this film was peopled with, but i tried not to be too judgmental. live and let live i always say. sure these people were all smug, egomanical jerks, but they seemed to be struggling a little with their existence and seemed willing to ask some questions about themselves and things. that's all i've ever asked from people, show a little reflection and insight into what you do and what motivates your behavior. i mean you're not animals right? right? at least i hope not. mostly in real life people practice very little self criticism or reflection about anything. most people are all action and no thought.<br/><br/>this film was pretty typical of most Hollywood garbage. it makes sex look easy and all you have to do is want to have sex and it shall come. whoa. my brains fall out just thinking about the silliness of that notion. it also, as usual, attempts to paint a cheery portrayal of gay life. another stupid notion. yeah right. all gay people sit around watching 'Glee' or lying on the floor having pseudo menstrual cramps with the girls. and no matter how overweight or homely you are you can always score with a really cute guy easily. whoever wrote that crap must either be straight or seriously deluded. STOP WITH THE WHITEWASHING Hollywood! it doesn't wash with a lot of us.<br/><br/>also the rapper Ludicrous was a total joke here. does he really want to act so bad that he is willing to sell out and be the one token black face in a film that is a sea of white faces. there really were little or no black people in this film. not even the film extras. typical Hollywood. good to be conscious of your sexuality but not about your racism. shame on Ivan Reitman.<br/><br/>love and relationships are just about the most difficult thing you will do in life. even casual sex probably doesn't come all that easily, but i wouldn't know anything about that.this movie makes having sex and love look so easy. a deluded, silly and shallow notion of things. love hurts whether it is right or wrong.<br/><br/>at least the idiots that this movie was about attempted some reflection on their mindlessly one track behavior. but the list of wrongs here is a little too long for my taste. especially when Natalie Portman's ugly ""grenade"" of a best girlfriend informs her that if she continues to be depressed or a downer she will ""seriously have to avoid her in the hallway"". typical of current insensitivity which is so trendy and popular. especially with ugly, fat, ""grenade"", ethnic girls. that didn't sound nice did it? well neither was the girl's behavior. Hollywood is pretty messed up. had to prove a point.<br/><br/>as for Ashton and dumb little Natalie Portman? well neither one has ever impressed me much, but they are both likable enough presences and did well to help tolerate this trivia. they can definitely act and are affable enough to radiate a certain amount of warmth and sweetness. as a matter of fact Kutcher and Portman sum up the whole experience here, the film like the two actors, is kinda cute."

","In this comedy, Emma (Natalie Portman) and Adam (Ashton Kutcher) are life-long friends who almost ruin everything by having sex one morning. In order to protect their friendship, they make a pact to keep their relationship strictly ""no strings attached."" ""No strings"" means no jealousy, no expectations, no fighting, no flowers, no baby voices. It means they can do whatever they want, whenever they want, in whatever public place they want, as long as they don't fall in love. The questions become - Can you have sex without love getting in the way? And can their friendship survive? <br/><br/>Now, let me start this by saying that I'm a huge fan of Natalie Portman. She's, in my opinion, the best actress out there, by a long shot. Every film she's in is that much better because of her and she has given some amazing performances throughout her career. Suffice to say I have seen everything she has done so far and felt obliged to watch No Strings Attached as well. However, I had really low expectations for this film. Let's be honest, comedies usually suck, let alone romantic comedies starring Ashton Kutcher. Honestly, I was entertained by the film but it's your run of the mill rom-com. The plot is extremely predictable, the jokes for the most part are silly, childish and not clever at all, and the film uses the same formula of every comedy that has come from Hollywood in the last decade. There's even the goofy sidekick to provide comic relief.<br/><br/>Regarding the acting I thought Kutcher did an OK job but he never truly gives himself into the character. In short he was a bit wooden. Portman on the other hand, can do no wrong. I think the reason why I was able to somewhat enjoy the film was definitely her presence and with any other actress this film would have been much worse. All in all, it's a formulaic rom-com that benefits from one of its lead actors but it's still a very weak effort.<br/><br/>6.5/10"

","No Strings Attached (2011) <br/><br/>** 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>Friends Emma (Natalie Portman) and Adam (Ashton Kutcher) decide to try to be lovers with no emotional connection and while the non-stop sex works at first soon Adam begins to have feelings, which pushes Emma away. NO STRING ATTACHED isn't going to be mistaken for a Bergman film nor is it going to win any awards at the Oscars but considering what the film is it works fairly well even though you know where it's going and what route it's going to take to get there. It was kind of refreshing seeing an R-rated romantic comedy again since the majority of them over the past twenty-years have been aimed at the PG-13 market. You know, those romantic comedies where even the adults act like dumb teenagers. Either way, this film here isn't perfect and has a lot of issues but on the whole it was a pretty fun film. It should go without saying but what will make or break a film like this are the two leads because if there's not any chemistry then there's no where for the story to go. Portman and Kutcher really do seem like they'd be an odd pair to put together in a film like this but it actually makes the story work. You really can look at these two characters, see how different they are and believe that they'd be in a sex only relationship. Kutcher is basically playing himself but there's no question that he can have a charming side and it's on full display here. He can deliver the sly lines without any problem and he comes across as a good-hearted guy, which is exactly what his character is. Portman delivers a fine performance as well as she has no problem playing this workaholic character with a few personal issues of her own. I'm sure many people might feel that a role like this is below her but she turns in a memorable performance and handles the raunchy humor quite well. Portman and Kutcher have no problems coming off like a real couple as they work well off one another and that's pretty much all you can ask. Kevin Kline gets a few good spots as Kutcher's famous father who has a few drug problems of his own. It was really fun seeing Kline again and he delivers a fun performance. An almost unrecognizable Cary Elwes is in good form as are Greta Gerwig, Lake Bell and Ludicrous who play the friends. The biggest problem with the film is the screenplay, which is your typical romantic comedy stuff meaning you know where the film is going to go and there aren't any surprises along the way. Even before the movie starts you know how it's going to end and sadly the final twenty-minutes really go out of control because what you know is going to happen just keeps getting pushed back to the point where the movie overstays its welcome. The start of the picture also suffers from some pacing problems but the middle section contains some good raunchy humor, funny sex scenes and the two stars certainly make it cute and charming."

","Yeah, while watching, I really felt very disappointed, what a bummer this one is. You expect so much, much more from Natalie Portman. But then, some time after the halfway mark, there is a marked improvement fueled by that restaurant scene, let's call it the Burning Man conversation, with Emma telling Vanessa the score exactly as it is, and swaying me over towards her for the first time.<br/><br/>But prior to that (and remember what I often mention in my reviews: First Impressions Count, they define the experience you're gonna have of the movie - very few pictures improve as they go along, so judgment is made very early on), this movie, this big star-driven effort, plods along like there's A Lot Of Chains Attached.<br/><br/>Besides Young Emma, whom I soon began thinking should rather grace the screen again, the only really cute thing during the first half is the impressions done by that Saturday Night Live girl - Nemo and Drew Barrymore. What a scene-stealer. Then, the hilarious girl-girl scene. <br/><br/>With somebody like Ivan Reitman at the helm, you would certainly not expect that such a drab performance by the female lead would persist all through the first half. I mean, any director watching the inflow should have noticed the under-performance. ESPECIALLY if she's NATALIE PORTMAN.<br/><br/>But do note that unlike the other reviewers here, I am pointing out that there is an improvement as the flick progresses. I was actually mentally preparing myself for the scything comments I was gonna make about this big production that fails to deliver, but Natalie (and the script) does better further on. Too late though.<br/><br/>Truth remains, it needed, at the very least, a partial remake.<br/><br/>And I remember only too well that decades ago I predicted such big things for Natalie after first seeing THE PROFESSIONAL. At her best in NO STRINGS ATTACHED, she is just run-of-the- mill. I am grading on a curve, tall trees catch more wind, and all that. <br/><br/>Maybe Natalie was taking a break here, just kicking back?"

","Well, this is classic romantic comedy when one of the characters want to date, and the other one only wants sex. That's an ordinary issue of life, and I didn't know it was universal-- well, maybe I thought it only happened in my city. One curious thing is that usually in this kind of relationship the male part is the one who wants only sex instead of a commitment, and in this flick the girl is the liberal one. Maybe that's a tendency coming from our society to equate the genres, considering that other recent movies like ""What's Your Number?"" and ""(500) Days of Summer"" already showed this trend. That assimilation is happening mainly in the USA, and since Brazilian's society is much likely Americans, we are advancing in the same speed. Maybe that's a sign that soon there will be no big differences between men and women. Speaking about the movie itself, it's well acted, written and directed. Nothing above the expected, and unfortunately appeals to Hollywood clichés in the end, but it's interesting to notice a difference kind of work from Natalie Portman."

Although the script does a reasonable job with the flaws it really doesn't explain how such a premise could even enter someone's head without there being a string attached, no matter how flawed their character is.<br/><br/>But the idea provokes a fairly entertaining series of episodes where the leads Emma (Portman) and Adam (Kutcher) test each other to the point of distraction, the only difference to an ordinary romance being the falsehood constructed at the very start of the relationship.<br/><br/>The acting is largely good with a range of characters to ease us through the episodes that zig-zag us around the houses in a chase that has one of two endings - either they have a proper relationship or they don't, and long before the end we know the sex only thing is not working.<br/><br/>So we have to work quite hard to get to the conclusion but it is a pleasant enough duty to perform with Portman and Olivia Thirlby as Katie being the star turns. It is good enough to want to see again but not so great you'll regret it if you don't.<br/><br/>Six out of ten."

","'No strings attached' is about a problem that many people suffer, in particular when they are young: you want to have it all.<br/><br/>In this case, it's sex without the restrictions imposed by a serious relationship. Predictably this does not work, but the youngsters in 'No strings attached' have yet to find out.<br/><br/>This film's main attraction lies in the clever way its story is told. Lighthearted, with a touch of humor, & easily recognizable for everyone. Attractive to both males and females, for the plot carefully gives room for their two different views.<br/><br/>All in all, 'No strings attached' is a nice light comedy. I wouldn't call it great, but it surely provides you with 104 minutes of genuine entertainment."

","This movie ALMOST did it for me. It was kind of slow to set up, with some stereotypes that seemed like representations of other stereotypes from other movies. Natalie Portman nailed the character of the girl who has intimacy issues but tries to deny it, until things suddenly get serious, then it really hits her that she might have lost Adam and the chance at something real. The scene towards the end where they meet outside the hospital...I started to tear up a little and get misty eyed...but then the dialogue suddenly turned very corny (""if you come one step closer, I'm not gonna let you go"") which suddenly made the whole scenario unreal so it lost me. With some re-writing, this could have been a really touching story with a lot of truth to it. But instead they settled for some trite re-hash and a patchwork movie that didn't quite seem to know what it was as a story or genre. Very disappointing because despite the cookie-cutter beginning, this movie had me hooked but then lost me."

Yes, even Ashton Kutcher actually acts in this film. Well, perhaps not all the way through - his performance improves throughout and he ends the film well. Olivier he's not, but he is better here than in all of his other films (combined).<br/><br/>Well written and very well directed. Even given the free wheeling sexual nature of the film, there is nary a skin shot, except for Kutcher's butt early in the film; yet, somehow the passion and sexual trysts are totally believable.<br/><br/>This is not an award winning piece for Portman (unlike Black Swan); still, she does bring a level of class to the film.<br/><br/>Well worth a trip to the theater for a couple of hours of fun and laughter."

","The Story Emma (Portman) is afraid of relationships, so after she impulsively gets into bed with Adam (Kutcher), she suggests that they ""use each other for sex"" on an ongoing basis, on the condition that no romantic feelings are allowed. If one of them falls in love, they are to end it.<br/><br/>The premise is nothing new, of course: Jerry and Elaine acted it out (complete with similar ""ground rules"") on Seinfeld just under twenty years ago in an episode entitled, ""The Deal,"" and it's been used many times since, on Grey's Anatomy, for example. However it's as though everyone involved took the weak premise as a challenge, and turned it into something, if not great, certainly good. The jokes are clever (some even made me laugh out loud), the two leads are charming, and it all works.<br/><br/>Something odd Portman's friend and costar in Black Swan, Mila Kunis (who presumably also remembers Kutcher from That 70's Show) has a movie called Friends with Benefits in post-production. She and Justin Timberlake star as friends who decide to have sex without romantic entanglement. The trailer includes a premise-establishing conversation that's pretty much lifted from the script of the aforementioned ""The Deal"" episode of Seinfeld. But let's call it homage.<br/><br/>Something eerie... Both Portman and her friend Kunis are, according to IMDb, 5'3""(1.60 m.). Kutcher is seventeen feet taller.<br/><br/>In any case, the ""sex buddies"" storyline is now officially its own romantic comedy sub-genre.<br/><br/>Why you should see it You like funny dialog and good acting, and are willing to look past an overused premise.<br/><br/>Why you should avoid it You hate romantic comedies. You hate Ashton Kutcher. You hate Natalie Portman. No, scratch that last one. Not possible.<br/><br/>--from my review at www.1man365movies.com"

","We meet the young friends at a party when everyone is pairing off, Emma (Portman) and Adam (Kutcher) are not together, just friends despite the ill judged, both story and script wise, vulgar comment from Adam.<br/><br/>We spiral through a few years with the pair meeting again and then again and so forth. At no point does the relationship change until, well it does. Friends no more and now, if not lovers, then ""Friends With Benefits"" (not to be confused with film of the same name) or ""Bed Buddies"".<br/><br/>The crux of the story is, can you have a sexual relationship with regular meetings, whenever the mood strikes, without that pesky love thing and petty jealousies getting in the way. In real life this may be more complicated to answer but in the movies, the answer to provide a three act story, is that you cannot.<br/><br/>Adam is an assistant on what appears to be a ""Glee"" wannabe TV show. He is desperate to write but with little opportunity to do so, whilst he remains in the long shadow of his father ""Alvin"" (Kline), a much loved TV show character with his own annoying catchphrase. Dad is aging disgracefully and when he starts recycling, not paper but his sons girlfriends, their relationship understandably takes a hit.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Emma, so buttoned up she actually does not have any buttons just in case, is the emotionally barren daughter of a equally frosty mother. Emma is a rather improbable busy hospital doctor with the obligatory movie gay friend mixing it up with her two girl flatmates, the four providing great comedic possibilities that are not really explored.<br/><br/>There is little chemistry between the main pairing, neither are terrible but Portman is not on top form and Kutcher seemingly plays a facsimile of the real Ashton Kutcher yet again. Lake Bell as ""Lucy"", admiring Adam from not so far, is more amusing. Striking a note just a restraining order's width away from stalker and with the awkwardness to match when presented with her prey.<br/><br/>Kline looks like he is enjoying himself but this is very lightweight film that still manages to strike the odd bum note in tone. Whatever happened to chaste comedies like ""When Harry Met Sally"" and ""Youv'e got Mail"", do we really need to know someone is putting on a condom?<br/><br/>Perhaps a comedy where both parents are not rich, with expensive weddings and lives might strike more of a note with cinema-goers. <br/><br/>It remains to be seen if the more recent ""Friends with Benefits"" strikes a better balance in tone. Certainly in this film you may find your female partner shouting, ""just what do you want lady?"", as the film draws to a close.<br/><br/>Summary <br/><br/>Not without some merit but overall, a middle of the road Rom Com with the emphasis on comedy rather providing any insight on the subject matter or any real life situations.<br/><br/>http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.com/"

I think not! But from looking at those titles, there's always one that's better quality than the other. And if you're trying to decide which one is worth your time. Let me help you make that decision. <br/><br/>Both 'No Strings Attached' & 'Friends With Benefits' are typical and predictable, definitely something for the ladies. Both portray a modern female character who are empowering and career focused & don't want a serious relationship. But we can all guess what happens at the end, women hormones and emotions take over. <br/><br/>But if we're going to compare the pair, 'No Strings attached' takes the cake hands down. The film's script takes on a much wittier approach and gave me a few chuckles and giggles. At the same time there were scenes that got me a little choked up. It was a good mix of comedy and romance like the genre suggests. <br/><br/>Not to mention Kutcher and Portman who were portraying these typical characters, seem to have more chemistry and didn't make my skin crawl. Even the older wiser character in both films, played by Kline (Adam's Father) had more of a distinct characteristic and was flawed and funny as oppose to the 'Friends with Benefits' counterpart played by Clarkson (Jamie's mother) who's character failed to even resonate in my memory.<br/><br/>'Friends with Benefits' is a Justin Timberlake fans only film. Mila and Justin made a good effort, but if you're looking for a film with a typical plot that would make you laugh and cry. You'd be better off checking out Reitman's 'No Strings Attached' attempt. <br/><br/>Even though the 'No Strings attached' tag line appears to be directly ripping off 'Friends with Benefits'. How I see it is, if you're going to do something that's been overdone and clichéd. Then do it well. And 'No Strings Attached' did just that"

","The first of many films Natalie Portman did in 2011 was No Strings attached, a romantic comedy with a similar premise to a film called Love and other drugs. This film stars Portman and Ashton Kutcher, and that film starred Jake Gylenhaal and Anne Hathaway, and was better. But No Strings attached isn't bad, from Romantic comedy standards.<br/><br/>Portman and Kutcher play old friends who bump into each other one night, and then years later do the same, and then, during one meeting, they decide to be friends with benefits(that movie will be a rip off of this one). They will have no strings attached sex. But as they start to do this, Kutcher begins falling for her, but shes not really that into him.<br/><br/>The two leads are likable, and the movie is cutesy in its little way. But the supporting characters are the funny thing about it. No strings attached has a couple of funny characters that make the film light up a little.<br/><br/>I sort of liked the movie, and compared to some other romantic comedies its decent. But it is cliché and predictable, but thats why all romantic comedies suffer. The two leads have chemistry though, and for that, you should give no strings attached a go on DVD.<br/><br/>B-"
"Robert_duder","Null","0","2","12 July 2011"," A sort of forced Portman/Kutcher vehicle that is fun but also flat at times
","No Strings Attached looked like it was exactly that. A film that would provide some laughs, good times, but then you mostly leave it behind and forget all about it and that is for the most part exactly what it is. However, given the names on this film I think many go in expecting a lot more especially from Natalie Portman who is definitely rising up as the hottest, best young actresses in Hollywood. For the most part I agree. The film however doesn't provide as many laughs, or gags or Kutcher's trademark physical comedy that he could have done a lot of in the film. The romance is pretty light given it is the focus of the entire film and while both actors are talented, their chemistry wasn't huge and fiery. It wasn't bad chemistry, don't get me wrong, but better chemistry could have pulled the film from mediocrity.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman is Emma. Emma is free spirited, strong, a medical residence, a modern day woman. Unfortunately for Portman the character doesn't really go to any depths beyond that. She is cute and lovable and sexy and then that's all they need from her so they leave it at that. The same could be said for Ashton Kutcher who plays struggling writer Adam. The difference is Kutcher manages to put a little more emotion and down to earth charm to his character (something that is really his trademark.) He isn't exactly any different than he is in any other romantic comedy but you do relate to him and find him watchable. The two of them fit together, and certainly make for a hot couple physically. I just wish they had given both of them more to work with character wise. The supporting cast (the typical friends in the relationship) are mostly just romantic film fodder. They are decent and fun but do not stand out in any way even rap star Ludicrous. None of them make themselves significant to the story or film.<br/><br/>So is the director a fresh youngster still learning the ropes? Nope. It is legendary director Ivan Reitman. He knows comedy like few others, and also has created and directed some of the most legendary film characters in history. Here is the issue. I firmly believe No Strings Attached is a true Hollywood studio film meaning they had the rights, wanted to slap it together and get it out there to make money. I know often actors and directors etc. are under contract to studios and I think that's why talented Hollywood people end up in fluff that isn't exactly up to their standards. No Strings Attached is not a bad film and if you're a fan of Kutcher or Portman you will likely enjoy it but don't expect it to blow your mind. I think the upcoming complete copy ""Friends With Benefits"" starring Justin Timberlake (a proved hilarious comedian) and Mila Kunis looks like they might have taken the concept and star power and put more work into it. No Strings Attached certainly won't leave a lasting impression. 7/10"

","From director Ivan Reitman (Ghostbusters, Twins, Evolution), this came out in cinemas two months after Sex & Other Drugs, they were not competing the same year, but they are both similar films with subtle differences, I watched this one second. Basically Dr. Emma K. Kurtzman (Natalie Portman) and Adam Franklin (Ashton Kutcher) met each other in their youths at summer camp, and since then they have been bumping into each other few years, Adam writes and assists on a TV show and Emma is a nurse. One day Adam finds out that his washed up actor father Alvin (Kevin Kline) is having a relationship with his ex-girlfriend Vanessa (Ophelia Lovibond), and he goes out to forget all about it drowning in alcohol. Next morning he wakes up in Emma's house, he finds comfort in her to talk about many things in his personal life, and soon enough they have sex. This becomes a constant thing and they decide to become ""sex friends"", restricting the relationship to sex only, as she is not comfortable with dating or being completely in love with someone. She also decides to hide this sex only relationship from her friends and house-mates Patrice (Greta Gerwig) and Shira (Mindy Kaling), and for a while things are going well in the non serious sexual encounters. Adam starts to get jealous if she hangs out with other men, and he becomes even more distraught when he finds out his father Alvin and Vanessa are planning to have a baby, and Emma is getting increasingly uncomfortable with dating, even on Valentine's Day. It is when Adam announces that he loves her that she really gets angry, saying that he should be with someone who won't hurt her, and after dropping her off at a hospital they unofficially break up. Six weeks later production assistant Lucy (Lake Bell) submits a script Adam wrote for the show he works on, and it is accepted and he becomes an official script writer, while Emma is breaking down missing him, spending time with her sister Katie (Olivia Thirlby) who is getting married, and her widowed mother Sandra (Talia Balsam) who has a new boyfriend. She tries to call him but he seemingly ignores her, but she really wants to be with him and goes to his house, but she is devastated to see him arriving back with Lucy, but she misreads her being a new girlfriend. They were planning to have sex, but they are interrupted when Adam receives the devastating news that his father is in hospital having overdosed on cough syrup, and Vanessa confesses she no longer wants to be with an older man, or around any old people for that matter. After initially having a heated phone call, Adam and Emma get together to make up, and they attend her sister's wedding together wondering what will happen next, in the end we see them holding hands. Also starring Cary Elwes as Dr. Metzner, Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges as Wallace and Jake M. Johnson as Eli. Kutcher is I guess likable and charming enough, Portman, who starred in Black Swan around the same time, is beautiful and sweet as his love interest, and together they make a good on screen couple, it is not necessarily original with the in love, breaking up and back again part, and the ""sex friends"" that fall in love is a bit obvious, but it is not a bad romantic comedy. Worth watching!"

","The cast in this film was spot on. It was particularly refreshing to find even the smallest of roles, uttering what could be the most innocuous of lines, laugh-out-loud funny. The Kutcher- Portman relationship rang true, outstripping any buzz about stripping, and one had the feeling the actors cared both about the script and each other. Kevin Kline is, of course, a national treasure. First time I've seen Greta Gerwig, Lake Bell, Ophelia Lovibond, Jennifer Irwin, or Olivia Thirlby (or noticed them) and they were all fantastic. And though I'd seen Mindy Kaling, Talia, Balsam, Jake M. Johnson, Ludicrous, and Abby Elliot before, they made the often-bandied belief that ""In America there are no ensemble actors"" seem like an outright lie. Cary Elwes was phenomenal with less than a half-dozen lines (and nobody does ""lame"" like him). There was so much less-is-more from the cast as a whole that the experience was lifted toward the sublime."
"Superunknovvn","5","0","1","5 May 2011"," Okay for what it is, but incredibly blimpish
","Of course I didn't expect a subversive movie, when I started watching ""No Strings Attached"", but parts of it seemed unintentionally blimpish considering how hard the movie strives to be the exact opposite. With the working title ""F*** Buddies"" later changed to ""Friends With Benefits"" then changed to the final title, ""No Strings Attached"" obviously sells itself as a liberal kind of romantic comedy, one that acknowledges the lifestyle of modern, young people. Boy does it miss its mark.<br/><br/>Firstly, it's so incredibly old, boring and simply unbelievable to have characters in a movie who fit together perfectly and are happy with each other, BUT for some reason are afraid of relationships and the three words ""I love you"". I don't buy it, and I don't wanna see it anymore. It's the biggest RomCom cliché ever and I don't people have ever enjoyed seeing it. So can we please stop having it in romantic movies?<br/><br/>Secondly, the way the movie promotes equal rights is just phony. For instance, there is a gay character, who just serves one purpose: to show how the movie is okay with gay people. It's the definition of token. That character plays no role in the movie whatsoever, and still there's a couple of scenes where the joke is on him, not least the first time we get to see him and are to assume for a second that Ashton Kutcher had a drunken one night stand with him. The reaction the movie wants from us in that moment is to go: ""Oh my gosh! Kutcher had sex with that ugly fairy!"" And frankly, that's just insulting. I'm going a bit off topic now, but it's kind of like that moment in ""Paul"" where the alien makes vulgar gestures that reference anal sex between two men first, and then ""redeems"" itself by saying: ""It's okay, I don't mind gay people."" It is still disrespectful, goddammit!<br/><br/>Thirdly, the movie thinks it's progressive, because Kutcher is the emotional guy in the relationship, whereas Portman is distanced, concentrates on her career and then in the end turns out to be the one who has to fight to get the guy back. You know, the classic pattern, but with the genders switched. Only problem: It's AT LEAST 10 years too late for that! This is nothing new, dear makers of this movie! If anything, it's a pretty sad testimonial to how long it took for Hollywood to realize that people can think outside the box of what is the expected behavior of men and women.<br/><br/>Well, having said all that, I have to admit that the movie is not incredibly bad. In fact, if you like Ashton Kutcher and Natalie Portman, you're probably going to get a couple of laughs out of this. Kevin Kline is wasted, Ivan Reitman is nowhere near the top of his game, the script has a thousand flat characters and some cringe-worthy scenes (the period-mix tape, anyone?) but yeah, ""No Strings Attached"" has its amusing moments, too. It's just a bit hard to enjoy them, when the movie's general mindset leaves such a bad taste in your mouth."

And that break brings in wisdom. <br/><br/>'No Strings Attached' is not the typical love story but not a very extraordinary love story as well. Theme wise a bit similar to many romantic movies but more closer to 'love and other drugs'. Proves again that relationships don't work only for sex. The movie is not boring. And it's not extra interesting. You may just sit back and watch the love story roll out with quite a lot of talk about sex and its related in the first half. As it goes it becomes a little serious and dramatic in a point or two. And brings in humor as well time to time. That's it!<br/><br/>Having the Oscar winning Natalie Portman kicks off well.

","There are only two reasons you go to watch thiz movie. First bcoz of ""Black Swan"" (2010), you want to see Natalie Portman! Or you're one of those who think Ashton Kutcher is cute! The story follows Adam (Kutcher) and Emma (Portman) who are friends since childhood. Somehow they promise to use each other for physical reason which is sex! It's exactly what Anne Hathaway did with Jake Gyllenhaal recently in ""Love and Other Drugs"" (2010). They want sex, but in the process to that they find something more special. Kutcher has fun and easy-going character (where he did just well most of the time). On the other hand, Portman gives a balancing to their interaction. It's good, not bad at all for sure, but it's like using big Bazooka to kill a little bird, completely waste of talent. The movie comes from the Director who is the father of ""Ghostbusters"" (1984) and Arnie's ""Kindergarten Cop"" (1990). The fun factor is still on the air for about half hour of the beginning, we could still feel the excitement and freshness, afterwards the movie becomes a never-ending boredom. In my note, what happened to modern Rom-Coms nowadays, it's almost impossible, making movie without raising Gay Issues. For example in thiz movie, one of Portman's best friends is gay, and so with one of Kutcher's best friends also has gay parents. Another factor that occurs to most of modern Rom-Coms lately is the use of vulgar words and irreverent dialogue, it's totally unbearable, including thiz one. By the way, if you came to see Portman being naked in the first place. Well, instead of that, you get Kutcher being naked! It's pretty ugly for the one who expects more. One good evidence of the situation that describes you fell when no strings attached.<br/><br/>Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE: http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com"
"r-sab-08","8","0","2","12 March 2011"," This movie really connects
","This movie to me connects to the sex industry in a way, those guys have sex just for relief,money and a good time and they try to keep it as its all a business nothing else. This is exactly what this movie is about and it delivers well,two people that have met each other since they were kids, 21 years ago. Turn out into sex buddies. I really enjoyed it both Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher acted really well. There was some good laughs,hot sex scenes and love in this film so i give this a 8/10 if your a couple or just a bunch of girls/guys your better off watching it but with your family is just a no.And on a side note. It was like watching sex with girls around you."

","""No Strings Attached"" is a terrible film. Thematically, and very superficially, it resembles ""gender cinema"" of the 1960s (eg ""Love With The Proper Stranger"", ""The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie"", ""Shampoo"" etc), in which supposedly ""feminist"" female characters free themselves from the shackles of patriarchy to become, quite ironically, emancipated, one dimensional, ""no strings attached"" sex objects for men, before realising that, actually, polyamory is overrated and nothing beats good old fashioned monogamous family values. These ""liberation movements"", and films, didn't really change anything, so much as they opened up the female workforce for exploitation (feminism always ignored class in favour for gender discrimination and sexist oppression). With twice as many employable people on the market, wages then went down.<br/><br/>The film stars Ashton Kutcher and Natalie Portman. Kutcher's films are all about his giant ego and smug, pretty-boy body obsessions. Here, a thoroughly pleased Portman (""Watch me, love me, celebrate the wonders of my gym"") matches Kutcher's narcissism blow for blow, the actress celebrating her newfound womanhood and bodily confidence by constantly thrusting her boyish frame in our faces like she's desperately auditioning for a bored paedophile.<br/><br/>4/10 – Worth no viewings."

","Natalie Portman's name in the credits will lure me into any film, and when paired with the ever- so-underused Ashton Kutcher I was quite intrigued as of what was to come. My excitement, let me tell you, was all in vain. Even by romantic comedy standards, ""No Strings Attached"" is an abomination. The basic idea, two people having sex without a relationship, isn't nearly as scandalous as it hopes to be. In fact, I've seen more controversy evoked by an episode of the Teletubbies. The clichés are so over the top it becomes impossible for the viewer to let them slide. And most importantly, it lacks the most essential ingredient of a decent romantic comedy - character chemistry. I would've rather watched siblings making out.<br/><br/>How Portman went from making Black Swan to this shall remain one of the great mysteries of mankind. Obvious Jew-jokes aside, I know this is a blockbuster movie that must have come with a big, fat paycheck. However, for an A-list actor that can hardly be the main motivator so we can only keep guessing. Perhaps the appeal was Kutcher, but as it seems like, judging by the on-screen action, she would rather have intercourse with a syphilis-ridden slug this seems quite unlikely."

","I expected No Strings Attached to be a raunchy/romantic comedy and it was really good as that. I love Natalie Portman's versatility as she just did Black Swan and seeing her do well in this makes me a fan of her and I respect her a lot. This is Ashton Kutcher's ""home ground"" and he did good also. The movie had it fair share of laughs, it wasn't hilarious or fall off your chair laughing funny but it was funny. I enjoyed the story lines behind each of the characters, it was nice to watch as each unfolds however the movie is a bit predictable which I didn't really like. This quote stayed with me from the movie: ""We don't pick who we fall in love with and it never happens like it should"" and it pretty much sums up this movie All in all,if you like the cast and in the mood for a romantic comedy then this is the movie for you!"
"rockinradha","5","0","1","14 February 2011"," No strings attached has no USP
","I will not waste time on the plot.....everybody knows it.....can friends with benefits stay without falling in love???? we also know how the movie will end as is true for most movies in this genre.<br/><br/>What however makes predictable plots click is the characters and the humor. However no strings attached lacks memorable characters or memorable moments. Most characters are stereotypical. We see ashton kutcher doing what he does All THE TIME these days i. e play a love sick puppy while natalie portmen stars as his ""commitment phobic"" sex friend. Yes we understand that for too long the guy was commitment phobic however that is no reason for every rom com movie to portray a commitment phobic girl thinking that its different. Its not anymore.<br/><br/>There is some chemistry between the leads (esp the first time they hook up) but that alone is not enough to save you from yawning and waiting for the intermission.<br/><br/>The supporting characters are all blah except for......no wait they are all BLAAAAAAAAH<br/><br/>I would only recommend this movie for people who wanto take a quick nap in the theater"
"batudingin","7","0","2","9 February 2011"," Feels like a very long trailer
","Due to its pacing and sudden change of scenes, this one is not a Woody Allen movie. However it is still quite enjoyable. I have great fun watching it, but not with great expectation. Do not go if you do have great expectation after seeing the trailer. This one feels like a very long trailer.<br/><br/>The score is terrible. Although I can understand the lyrics of the music is to emphasize the movie's premise. It does not add to the scene at all. And it is quite a shame that happened. And this one feels like it needed a laugh track somewhere, maybe from the extra characters. Since I watch it with people that has no preference of the jokes based on pop culture. It is lost in translation with the subtitles.<br/><br/>The extras was great actors and actresses, somehow has bad script. OK, not all of them are good. But the sister, the waitress, the doctor's friends are good. With better script, I do think it will be better.<br/><br/>It is a fun movie. The ending is not surprising. Nearing valentine's day, my advice is to watch others first. However you can watch it rental later without regret you haven't had big screen experience."
"ocsummerbabii","6","0","2","30 January 2011"," A chuckle here and there...
","Sometimes its nice to go see a light-hearted comedy which allows you to appreciate the finer things in life, such as a chance sexual encounter with a stranger. Especially when these strangers are as attractive as our leads. This obviously isn't a film for the kids and it was vulgar to the point where some scenes came across as tacky, but either way it earned laughs and that was the point in the end. Kutcher redeemed himself with this one, he's never really been an A actor, his performances are all pretty boy with no real flare, but in this one we can actually see some depth as he deals with the ups and downs of Portman. Portman on the other hand was hysterical to say the least, she was cute and bubbly and more importantly she had fun with her role. It was challenging for me as an audience member to walk out of Black Swan with awe and such respect for this woman, and then soon after witness her talk about a period mixed cd. There wasn't anything special about the directing or the soundtrack. It's your average cookie cutter romance, they just upped the sex. I recommend it, if you want a film to pass the time, which will make you smile. Just know, that you won't leave, move or touched. You just might have a smirk on your face."
"movieswithmitch","5","0","2","23 January 2011"," Almost a good Kutcher film, but no cigar.
","Mitch Hansch/ movieswithmitch.com<br/><br/>Now close your eyes. Imagine planning the perfect romantic night at home for your love. They come home to a spic and span house/apartment that you've meticulously cleaned all day. Those pecan scented candles they love are everywhere even though you have a minor allergy. A sensual CD mix of Neil Diamond and Lil' Wayne nobody thought would ever work but does plays as he or she follows the trail of rose petals leading to the kitchen where a seven course meal of everything they desire the most is waiting for them, finishing with that Warm Chocolate Chip Lava Cookie Maple Butter Blondie they had at that fancy restaurant that one time that blew their friggen mind! You can't believe how perfect the night has gone. They've got that look in their eye like they're going to do that thing to your ear that you've only read about in books but first your loved one requests a romantic movie to clinch the night before you retire to the bedroom. You reply, ""one step ahead of you my love. I bought ""Just Married"" for us to watch"" (she or he shakes their head no). No worries I also got ""My Boss's Daughter"" just in case. No? O.K., what about ""What Happens in Vegas"", or ""Valentine's Day"", or ""Killers"" (all angry no's as your mate grabs the car keys and says they and the kids will be staying with their mother for a while. <br/><br/>You blew it! That's what you get for shopping in the bargain bin. <br/><br/>Sorry I had to paint such a long illustration but it's important to know how the most perfect of efforts can be spoiled by one big mistake. In this case, the Kutcher mistake. Fair to say I'm not a big fan of his screen efforts. I'd rather be Scott Bakula's Dr. Sam Beckett from a ""Quantum Leap"" episode stuck as a roadie at the Lilith Fair than watch his movie marathon. Oh boy. But each effort deserves a fresh slate of honest criticism and alas, Kutcher does rise...as much as he can rise in ""No Strings Attached."" His performance here is the most sweet and effective I've seen him, really making you feel for the bugger. Don't want to give a back handed compliment but you play better when you have better to play with and he's never had as good as Natalie Portman to play with (pun intended) (no disrespect Katherine Heigl...o.k. a little disrespect). <br/><br/>Kutcher plays the overly sweet Adam who's an assistant for a High School Musical/ Glee type show but is really an aspiring writer and Portman plays Emma the self-professed emotional peanut-like allergic to relationships who's a doctor that works 80-hour weeks. Adam and Emma have been running into each other off and on for the past 15 years and when attraction erupts they agree to be nothing more than friends with benefits, if you know what I mean, and I think you do. Will they amount to more than just sex friends? Of course they will because Elizabeth Meriwether's first time screenplay is as formulaic as it gets. You know how it's going to play out from the beginning. ""No Strings Attached"" is a film that tries to go outside of the box with its crass dialog but it doesn't hold a dirty erotic dripping on the chest melting candle a la ""Body of Evidence"" to a Judd Apatow script which it desperately wants to be. Meriwether's script also suffers from overstaying its welcome on a honest, funny, or touching moment; not trusting the audience's intelligence. At the helm here is famed Ghostbusters's and Dave's director Ivan Reitman, who is just as much to blame for this. Rietman, who has more blunders than triumphs as the director, fails to take the opportunity to give this generation a relevant twist on the rom-com. <br/><br/>Supporting characters do go along way. Kevin Kline, Greta Gerwig, Jake M. Johnson, and Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges add a lot of comedic touches. I especially liked Lake Bell's nerdy timid performance as Adam's boss a great deal. But the real praise goes to Natalie Portman. Coming off of her Golden Globe win and probable Oscar win for ""Black Swan"", Portman takes to raunchy comedy in a way that we've rarely see her. Portman lights up the screen in a hilarious and sexy way, extending her incredible range as one of the most bankable actresses in the business. <br/><br/>With that said, I still can't recommend a film laden with all its obvious contrivances and missteps. Add ""No Strings Attached"" to the bargain bin of romantic night don't's.<br/><br/>Add ""this"" to the bargain bin of romantic night don't's. Proverbs 5:17-23"
