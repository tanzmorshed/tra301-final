"sieb-1","9","96","107","7 July 2004"," Reasonably good history, well acted and produced.
","The movie is a cut above most cinematic portrayals of historical events, likely due to it's being based on historian Cornelius Ryan's excellent book, and it's not as overproduced or staged as the film version of another of his books, The Longest Day. The producer admits to crediting one assault to the Americans, when in the event the British were first to attack, but overall the movie relates a good sense of history and geography, and respects the timeline of the actual events. It shows the national and class tensions affecting the Allied leadership, and gives a sense of the character of the participants. The writing gives the plethora of good actors something to work with despite no single leading role (and it's fun to watch so many actors in a single film.) Relevant information is included in the character's dialogue rather than through narration. The editing adds to the flow of events, balancing the suspense borne by the individuals involved with interest and action for the viewer. Add in the Intelligent direction by Richard Attenborough, and it makes this one of my favorite World War Two films."
"philip_vanderveken","9","108","124","29 September 2004"," What makes this movie so good is the realism, shown in every detail
","I'm a big fan of war movies and I already have a nice collection on DVD. One of them is A Bridge Too Far and I can only say that it is one of my favorites in this genre (if you can make a comparison between movies like A Bridge Too Far, Saving Private Ryan, All Quiet on the Western Front, Apocalypse Now... of course). What I really don't understand is why this movie never was a big success in the cinema's. Perhaps the people had enough of war movies ... and Star Wars was very hip and new at that time of course, but personally I love this movie. <br/><br/>What makes this movie so good is the realism. In most of the war movies of that period, everybody speaks English. No matter if it is a German, an American,... In this movie everybody speaks the language he is supposed to speak. There even is a difference between the English of the Americans and the British. But of course the use of different languages isn't the only thing that attracted me. Another good example is the fact that they didn't try to make all the Germans look like brainless killers, monsters without any human feelings. The movie showes them the way they really were: good and hard fighters who cared about their comrades just as much as any allied soldier, but who didn't just kill for fun. (Just for your information: I'm talking about the soldiers in the Wehrmacht here and not about the SS, even though not all SS-troops where that bad either. There are good and bad people in every army.)<br/><br/>The effort which was put in this movie is shown in every detail. The uniforms, the weapons, the landscapes, the cities..., everything really gives you the feeling the director wanted to give an accurate vision on what happened during operation Market Garden. Images from the movie were even incorporated in a documentary on this subject. That probably shows better than anything else how good this movie really is. <br/><br/>You probably ask yourself if there really isn't anything negative about this movie. Of course there is, but it never really bothered me. Therefore I reward this movie with a 9/10. Perhaps a little too high according to the average IMDb user, but for me it's sure worth it."
"barnabyrudge","7","173","203","10 November 2004"," Under-rated war epic.
","Quite a few bad things have been written about A Bridge Too Far. Richard Attenborough's elephantine recreation of the battle for several strategically valuable Dutch bridges in the winter of 1944 is a star-studded, lengthy and exhausting film (and many critics at the time seemed to be of the opinion that it collapsed beneath its own weight). Almost thirty years on, the film is now viewed somewhat more favourably. It may feel 30 minutes too long, and the need for so many stars in so many tiny parts is questionable, but A Bridge Too Far successfully shows a fierce episode of the Second World War in all its chaotic glory. Incredibly, there's no use of the computer generated effects during the big battle scenes that it is relied upon in modern films like Gladiator and Troy. The scenes in this film were shot pretty much as you see them - so the 35,000 parachutists storming Holland, the river crossing led by Robert Redford under intense enemy fire, and other such staggering combat sequences were filmed with thousands of extras and a good deal of meticulous planning and preparation.<br/><br/>The film is based upon Operation Market Garden, an Allied plot hatched towards the end of 1944 with the intention of ending the war in Europe. The concept behind the plan was to drop 35,000 soldiers into Holland approximately 60 miles beyond the German lines, to seize six vital bridges, and to reinforce the paratroopers by sending in thousands of ground troops. However, various mishaps jeopardised the mission and eventually the Allies were cut off and had to withdraw, suffering severe losses.<br/><br/>As stellar casts go, A Bridge Too Far still takes some rivalling. Among the many famous actors involved, these are just a few: Sean Connery, Robert Redford, Laurence Olivier, Dirk Bogarde, James Caan, Ryan O'Neal, Gene Hackman, Michael Caine, Anthony Hopkins and Elliott Gould. It seems pointless for some of the actors to be cast in these roles - true enough, Connery, Bogarde and Hopkins get decent roles and a fair bit of screen time, but was it really worth paying Redford $2,000,000 for his ten minute heroics? Could a decent actor have not handled the role for a fraction of that amount? Is Gene Hackman really the correct choice for Polish officer Major General Stanislaw Sosabowski? Should a light comic actor like Elliott Gould be doing his cigar-chomping ""fun"" turn in a movie as serious as this?<br/><br/>Luckily, the film is a big success on other levels. The cinematography is extraordinary; the music is suitably stirring; the potentially confusing story is handled with clarity and true-to-the-facts sensitivity; and amid the chaos a number of very memorable scenes emerge. A Bridge Too Far is a very good war film - maybe the biggest war film ever conceived (The Longest Day and Saving Private Ryan included) - and I feel that, although it has a few casting flaws, it is in almost every other department a great, great achievement."
"arnold2ice","9","118","141","4 July 2004"," A great war (and anti-war) movie
","I'm not a fan of hyperbole but this may be one of the greatest war movies ever made. It works on a number of levels. While being historically accurate it shows individual and group heroism without glorifying war. The players, German and Allied, are presented as human beings caught up in something bigger than themselves. No attempt is made at ""jingoism"" or gratuitous flag waving. It seemed to me to be refreshing free of moralistic or political statements. It simply let what happened speak for itself. For a history buff like myself it spoke volumes.<br/><br/>The movie is flawless. As mentioned above, it is surprisingly accurate. As one would expect from the cast, acting is first rate. Not a single scene is wasted.<br/><br/>This is a ""must see"" movie for anyone who appreciates movie making."

","As a resident I am, logically, interested in the history of my city. And knowing what went on here, I heard the stories from my grandmothers/fathers, they were just children at that time, it was so inspiring and emotional too watch this.

I'm so glad and proud that every year our city and our local football club(Vitesse) pays our respect tho what those people did, every year during the airborne remembrance, Vitesse plays a special airborne match, during the league(no friendly) on this day they have a special kit, in the colors of the 1st airborne division, all the veterans that fought in this battle are invited to come over, including family, and a lot of other British tourists, and it's amazing to see how my city still pays their tribute. <br/><br/>Lest we forget!"
"dr_foreman","9","91","108","23 January 2004"," my favorite WWII movie
","""Private Ryan"" may have served up more blood and guts, but it had a fanciful plot and it didn't really tell audiences anything about D-Day.  By contrast, ""A Bridge Too Far"" is like something the History Channel would produce; it's full of maps and narration and endless tactical discussions that, amazingly enough, really held my attention - and really enlightened me about the battle of Market Garden.<br/><br/>It helps that the ensemble cast is great - perhaps the best ever assembled - and the characterization, though a bit thin (as in most war movies), is certainly good enough considering how heavily the plot dominates.  The film's one major weakness is that it telegraphs the battle's result from too early on; all the smart characters think that the operation will be a disaster, and lo and behold, it's a disaster.<br/><br/>I love this movie anyway, maybe because of the production style, which is more realistic than the cornball war films of previous decades but not quite so over-the-top as ""Private Ryan.""  The battles are both thrilling and terrifying, a nicely struck balance.  When the end credits roll, I always feel tired - like the characters - which is a testament to how involving (and effective) the movie is."

","Richard Attenborough's monumental war drama is about one of the most stirring battles of World War II, based on the best-seller by Cornelius Ryan... The film presents the most impressive all-star cast ever assembled for a single production...<br/><br/>World War II's ""Operation Market Garden"" would have put the Allies in control of the major road leading into the industrial Ruhr, the heart of the German war machine... The war would have ended in a matter of weeks... Instead, what Market Garden left in its wake, through a combination of costly miscalculations, bad weather, battlefield politics and tactical errors, were more than 17,000 British, American, Dutch and Polish casualties, nearly twice as many dead as in Normandy...<br/><br/>On Sunday, September 17th, 1944, the largest assemblage of gliders, bombers, transports and fighters ever involved in a single mission flew over eastern Holland, and dropped 35,000 assault troops along the 64 mile road corridor between Belgium and Arnhem, the Dutch city on the Rhine River...<br/><br/>This airborne army - the Market phase of the operation - was assigned the task of taking and holding the six major bridges along the corridor... <br/><br/>Smashing through the crumbling German resistance along the way, the British Corps tanks and infantry - the Garden phase - were to link up with the paratroops and, with their help, drive the retreating armies of the Third Reich back into their own homeland...<br/><br/>The Germans, however, correctly guessed the British plan and formed a ring of armor around the approaches to the bridge at Arnhem... The result was near slaughter for all the allied forces and an enormous number of German dead...<br/><br/>Col. John Frost (Anthony Hopkins) and the survivors of his 2nd Battalion battered their way through heavy German fire to the northern end of Arnhem bridge, where they took up a strong position in houses over-looking the entire bridge...<br/><br/>For four long days and nights, Frost and his 'valiant few' held this tenuous position against superior German tanks and infantry... The Dutch civilian helped by piling the bodies of the dead - friend and enemy alike - in forbidding barricades across each major street to prevent Germans from reaching Frost and his men at the bridge...<br/><br/>Major General Roy Urquhart (Sean Connery), Brigadier James Gavin (Ryan O'Neal), Lieut.Col Joe Vandeleur (Michael Caine) and the rest of the Allied commanders met with much the same resistance and disaster...<br/><br/>At the Nijmegen highway bridge it became obvious that the British tanks would be stopped until the bridge's northern end could be taken by an assault crossing of the Waal River... This brave action, executed in a full clear day under murderous German fire by Major Julian Cook (Robert Redford) and his battalion, has been described by witnesses as one of the most heroic deeds of arms in World War II...<br/><br/>Delayed by ground fog in England, both replacements and badly-needed supplies were late in arriving... Communication was so bad; most of the food and ammunition fell into the hands of the Germans...<br/><br/>The Polish Parachute Brigade, under Major General Sosabowski (Gene Hackman) command, held up three days by the fog, finally made their drop into a deadly thick shower of German rifle and machine gun fire... Many died before they touched ground, and the rest met with further disaster...<br/><br/>Casualties were enormous and the hundreds of British wounded were placed in the Beautiful home - of Dutch heroine Kate Ter Horst (Liv Ullman) - offered as a surgery and the small hotels provided some bed space for the worst casualties... <br/><br/>Laurence Olivier (Dr. Spaander) wins a cease-fire from the German Lieut. General Wilhelm Bittrich (Maximilian Schell), in order to bury the dead and surrender the wounded...<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Col. Frost and the last few at Arthem bridge were taken prisoners by the Germans... Only a few escaped... Vandeleur's advance was stopped cold... Urquhart hopelessly surrounded planned a retreat down the river... The Germans, lighting the river with rockets, began firing on the fleet and only some made it to the other side...<br/><br/>The following morning, Padre Pere, a British Chaplain who stayed behind with his wounded men, noticed the mysteriously frightening silence that prevailed throughout the whole Oosterbeck area... All of the surviving patients realized that they were now German prisoners... The battle of Arnhem was over...<br/><br/>This is an enormous story of an horrifying human disaster... A plan formulated by Field-Marshal Montgomery and sanctioned by General Eisenhower... The film shakes you... The pity of it touches you...<br/><br/>Richard Attenborough has consolidated his position in the British cinema by directing notable films based on true characters and events: ""Young Winston,"" ""A Bridge Too Far"" and then had a phenomenal success with ""Gandhi,"" winner of 8 Academy Awards..."
"ryls","10","89","113","7 November 2004"," Last Great War Film Before ""Ryan""
","A Bridge Too Far was the last of a long line of the ""General's"" war-films that came out of Hollywood since WWII. Afterwards, the production for these films wavered, probably because of the fact that A Bridge Too Far did not fare so well in the box office.<br/><br/>One of the main reasons A Bridge Too Far did not succeed as it might have was because of the American audience. The film was a) targeted towards a British audience and b) made very soon after the end of America's involvement in Vietnam. The combination of time and subject killed the film. But anyone can tell you that every time this film is shown on a TV broadcast, the ratings are quite high.<br/><br/>The film itself, contrary to what many would claim, IS NOT another glorification of American heroism. While there is a certain American involvement which is rightly due, the film is very much centered on the Brits at Arnhem. Afterall, they were the ones that got massacred, right? Adding to that, the initial setup of the operation (which the film took surprisingly long to cover, and probably killed off the interest of the average movie-goer/critic) was almost solely concerned with the British planning, with one or two references to the American G.I. (I guess they had to put in those mini-episodes of American servicemen to attract the American viewing public).<br/><br/>But enough about the bad side of the film, now onto the amazing part:<br/><br/>This is the first film I have seen from that generation to create a realistic picture of what the setting was like (down to the very streets and houses of Holland, which, for comparison, The Battle of the Bulge managed to get ALL wrong --- as a sidenote: if you have seen the aforementioned film, have you noticed how during the climatic battle, tanks drove across a DESERT? The battle took place in January during the WORST winter storm of Europe in Belgium... and how they managed to convince the public that if a tank is painted with an iron cross, even though it's an American M48 main battle tank built in the late 50's, that it must be a German Tiger tank... sorry for the rambling). I am most impressed by the Arnhem bridge itself (sadly, they dedicated much too short a sequence of cheering soldiers to the bridge at Grave, which is probably one of the greatest Allied success EVER for a bridge assault, up there with Remagen and Pegasus), which is shot on location with probably the most accurate feel of just how desperate the situation was (and none of Private Ryan's heroism/John Wayne-invincibility either). <br/><br/>Characters are excellently portrayed, although how they really acted historically might be somewhat different. Camera-work was phenomenal, given the difficulty of shooting on scene (they couldn't close down the Arnhem Bridge for extended periods of time, one must realize). The most dramatic sequence was probably the launch of the planes and the subsequent breakout by XXX Corps, which to this day remains my favourite battle sequence in any movie (yes, even when compared with the Omaha scene from Saving Private Ryan).<br/><br/>Like the movie, my review has become unnecessarily long. But to conclude, this film deserves a good watch, or maybe even a couple of viewings, for any serious history/war-film lover or those who just want to learn more about those who have sacraficed so much for us. 9/10."
"bkoganbing","9","24","28","28 February 2008"," The Allies Overreach
","Although A Bridge Too Far, the story of the Allied failed offensive operation in the Netherlands known as Market Garden is based on a book by Cornelius Ryan who also wrote The Longest Day, it doesn't quite reach the classic heights of that film. Maybe because the Allies don't quite reach their objective and pay a terrible price.<br/><br/>I'm not quite sure that Dwight D. Eisenhower did not leave World War II with the biggest migraine headache of all time, having to contend with all the egos he did there. You can read the various memoirs and books about his subordinates, both British and American and the common thread that runs through all of them is how if Ike only listened to me, the war would have been over six to nine months earlier in Europe. And the sad thing is he had to balance military with domestic political considerations for both countries.<br/><br/>The events of September 17-25 of 1944 are what A Bridge Too Far depict. The idea was for Allied Airbourne Divisions both American and British to take a series of bridges in the Netherlands to facilitate the Rhine crossing into the Ruhr Valley of Germany. This was and is Germany's industrial heartland. Imagine if you will an operation to take bridges across the Ohio River to invade the industrial mid-west in the USA and you have some idea. Then the ground troops would invade and link the various isolated airborne troops and everybody go across the Rhine and into Germany. <br/><br/>In his memoirs one the best British commanders of World War II, Sir Brian Horrocks said that if the Allies had known that the Germans had mined the Schelde estuary leading to the port of Antwerp, Market Garden might have been feasible. If they had the use of Antwerp, because they had taken it at considerable cost, a steady supply line might have been available and half of what you see in A Bridge Too Far wouldn't have happened. The other big failure of Market Garden was the lack of usable roads to get the Allied tanks over. Horrocks is played by Edward Fox in the film and he's in command of ground troops. The Airborne Commander is Frederick 'Boy' Browning played by Dirk Bogarde.<br/><br/>The best role in the film is that of Sean Connery as the Commander of the most forward of the Allied Airborne armies playing General Roy Urquhart. It's quite true as depicted in the film that Urquhart was prone to airsickness. Urquhart spent nine days at the bridge too far as it turned out at Arnhem. He very nearly became a prisoner of war as his very graphically shown. Had the Germans captured Urquhart he would have been the highest ranking Allied General taken prisoner since General Richard O'Connor in the African desert in 1940.<br/><br/>Lots of American and British name players populate director Richard Attenborough's cast. Ryan O'Neal is General James M. Gavin a hero at D-Day whose 82nd Airborne was put under British command and did their job. Robert Redford is a major who makes a heroic attempt to rescue Connery's forces. James Caan has a nice part as an Army sergeant who forces a tired army doctor played by Arthur Hill at gunpoint to operate and save his lieutenant's life.<br/><br/>One of the best scenes in the film is Laurence Olivier as a Dutch doctor who is treating Allied wounded at Liv Ullman's house who goes and asks for a truce to get his wounded into the tender care of the Nazis. S.S. General Hardy Kruger would just as soon kill them all, but Maximilian Schell as German commander Bittner allows the truce.<br/><br/>One thing I loved about A Bridge Too Far is John Addison's music score for the film. It's right on par with the theme from The Longest Day that Paul Anka wrote.<br/><br/>Military historians will love A Bridge Too Far, it's a great example of one of the 'what ifs' of history."
"stryker-5","Null","95","124","14 February 1999"," ""It's All A Question Of Bridges""
","""Quite frankly,"" observes 'Boy' Browning, ""this kind of thing's never been attempted before.""  But it has.  In 1962, ""The Longest Day"" gave the epic star-studded treatment to the D-Day landings, and here we are, 15 years on, doing the same for the Arnhem debacle.  It has to be said, the film looks great.  From the gently-tinkling light fittings in the Dutch resistors' home to the beauty of the tank tracks in perspective, this is a gorgeously-photographed movie.<br/><br/>In 1944, the German armies were being pushed back across the Low Countries.  The Allies' great strategic problem was the Rhine, the wide river which formed Germany's western border.  A daring plan was conceived which would overcome the Rhine obstacle and open the road to Berlin. 'Market Garden', as the plan was codenamed, involved parachuting spearhead units onto the great bridges over the Rhine and securing them for the critical few hours it would take for an armoured column to drive up and relieve them.<br/><br/>It is easy now to point to the flaws in 'Market Garden', but at the time it looked like a daring and viable alternative to slogging it out against the Siegfried Line.  No-one had anticipated that the Dutch people would pour out onto the streets in throngs, thinking that they had been liberated, and thus bog down the armour.  The intelligence indications of heavily-equipped German units in the zone were ignored because they were inconvenient.  Critically, the plan allowed for only one solitary road to be available to the Irish Guards for the all-important northward thrust.  The film illustrates very effectively the way in which a plan can develop its own momentum, regardless of the shortcomings which riddle it.<br/><br/>The sequence of the boarding and dropping of the paratroops is a thrilling spectacle, shot on a colossal scale.  The German ambush which delays the rolling of the armoured column is another terrific action sequence.  Attenborough keeps tight control of a big, complex story, and interlards the large-scale stuff with 'human scale' passages, like James Caan's rescue of his buddy (incidentally, the tracking shot which follows his jeep through the forest is quite remarkable).<br/><br/>The fighting at Nijmegen is brilliantly-filmed.  Note how the street on the British side grows increasingly littered with war debris as the battle rages.  Robert Redford's assault across the river is a symphony in olive drab, leading to a wonderful moment of exhilaration.<br/><br/>Whether the viewer finds the singing of ""Abide With Me"" moving or grossly sentimental will depend on personal taste, but the subdued ending is very satisfying.  'Market Garden' may have helped shorten the war and may have achieved most of its immediate objectives, but it has to be seen as a tragic mistake.<br/><br/>The film is slick, professional and very pleasing on the eye.  One can't help wondering, however, if this kind of 'tank opera' was worth the effort, given that ""The Longest Day"" had done it all so splendidly a generation earlier."
"m0rphy","Null","84","112","26 June 2002"," A FAILED GAMBLE
","This video portrays with great precision in an almost acted documentary way the failed attempt in September 1944 to end WWII early based on the plan conceived by Field Marshall Bernard Law Montgomery of El-Alemain (with Eisenhower's approval).The Allies by this time had advanced deep into Belgium almost to The Dutch border but the advance suddenly slowed due to their out-running lines of supply and their inability to take a servicable port intact nearer their front line.Supplies were still being transported from the won Normandy beachheads a distance of over 500miles.<br/><br/>The Plan involved dropping British, American and Polish paratroopers at strategic bridges in the Netherlands such as The Son, The Grave, Nijmegen, to be taken by the American 82nd and 101st Airborne and the prize, Arnhem to be taken and held by British paratroops.Once all these bridges were captured and held, The British 1st Army would drive up the road linking them, thus giving the Allies a springboard to the Rhine and Germany.It was code-named ""Operation Market Garden"", Market being the airborne drop and Garden the drive up the road.That was the theory. The planners overlooked,by ignoring seemingly on purpose aerial reconnaisance photos which indicated that Dieter's SS Panzers were resting and re-equipping in the Arnhem area. The Allies' communications equipment had not been tested thoroughly enough e.g. ""walkie-talkies"" worked in open country but what about in built-up areas?Did they have the right sort of crystals fitted?The daily air drops to re-supply lightly armed paratroops could not work if the paras were not in their coded/designated drop zones. Amazingly after the strategic withdrawal from Arnhem, Montgomery is purported to have said it was ""90% successful""!<br/><br/>This film, directed by Richard Attenborough, was made in 1977 with a galaxy of well known stars i.e.:Dirk Bogarde as General Boy Browning,Lawrence Olivier, Liv Uhlman,Ryan O'Neal, James Caan, Robert Redford, Gene Hackman,Anthony Hopkins, Sean Connery and Michael Caine.They all play historical figures but for me the most effective was Edward Fox playing General Sir Brian Horrocks.The latter presented a UK TV series on WWII in the 1960's and Fox's mannerisms and speech patterns were unerringly similar.Please bear in mind that since the recent film ""The Saving of Private Ryan"", special effects in war films have gone up a quantum leap, e.g. the havoc that bullets/bombs/morters etc can wreak on the human body.So you are looking at 1977 special effects.Nevertheless the equipment including the DC3's and filming of the actual paratroopers drop into The Netherlands was most impressive.Sometimes the dialogue is a little stilted to modern tastes but this is or should be speech patterns from 1944.It was General Boy Browning who stated ""...but sir, I think we may be going a bridge too far"" when he met with the Allied top brass to oversee the plan which he had to execute.This is certainly one of the seminal WWII war films and the only one which concentrates on this failed strategy to liberate the Low Countries.<br/><br/>If you can forget the famous actors and get into their characters and have a sense of modern history, this long film will stimulate you."
"Theo Robertson","8","47","62","17 September 2003"," Good Account Despite The Monty Bashing
","I loved THE LONGEST DAY when I saw it as a child in the mid 1970s but have gone off it over the years because the characters are more like carichtures rather than real people and the dialogue sounds more like thought processes rather than spoken speech . I guess this is down to Cornelius Ryan not understanding the difference in writing a book and writing a screenplay . The film version of A BRIDGE TOO FAR the second of Ryan's trilogy giving the definitive account of the last year of the war in Europe is superior to THE LONGEST DAY simply because William Goldman has written a superior script than the one Ryan wrote . I can only fault Goldman's script for two things<br/><br/>1 ) Some obvious exposition throughout the first 45 minutes , though this probably isn't a fair criticism unlike .....<br/><br/>2 ) The Monty bashing . Along with SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and BAND OF BROTHERS this movie doesn't fail to put the boot into General Bernard Law Montgomery with a bunch of German Generals stating "" Not even Eisenhower would be stupid enough to use Montgomery "" and you do get the impression some people who get their history via war films will quickly come to the conclusion that Monty was the worst commander in human military history , never mind British military history . If Monty had a fault - And the only time it showed itself was during Operation MarketGarden - it was that he was too cautious but it should be remembered that he spent several years fighting on the Western front during the first world war . The likes of Patton , McArthur and future US president Harry S Trumann also fought in that conflict but America didn't enter WW1 until the spring 1917 and didn't contribute to any significant fighting until almost a year later . Unlike the British the future American commanders didn't experience a slaughter house like the Somme which had a profound effect of on Monty's psyche . It should also be remembered that no Western leader was better for turning a holding action into an offensive as seen at El Alamein and there was no better Western leader than Monty for a defensive holding action as seen at operation Goodwood in June 1944 . The problem with operation MarketGarden was logistics , intelligence reports , communications and just plain bad luck , not leadership<br/><br/>That criticism aside Goldman' script is a good one . Of course some facts and figures have been changed or omitted but the script does point out that great courage was shown by both sides and Goldman must be congratulated for including a scene where a Waffen SS trooper dies in a brave but vain attempt to save his commanding officer who is burning to death . The Waffen SS committed countless atrocities during the war but they were Nazi Germany's elite fighting force also capable of extreme bravery under fire so it's good to see a more balanced view of history , something not seen in more critically aclaimed productions like BAND OF BROTHERS and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN<br/><br/>It's a shame A BRIDGE TOO FAR didn't do all that well at the box office or receive the critical acclaim it deserved , but STAR WARS came out at the same time thereby destroying the popularity of historical blockbusters with all star casts . It should also be pointed out that the anti-war sentiments of the film are surpassed by Vietnam movies like APOCALYPSE NOW and PLATOON but how do you make an anti-war film featuring the second world war as a backdrop unless you're a German ? I remember talking to my schoolmates in 1982 after this was shown on TV the previous night and we all agreed at the time this was the best war movie ever made . Looking back now it's not , but it's still a very good account of men in battle<br/><br/>Footnote : Check out Ryan's book THE LAST BATTLE , the final - And best - book in the trilogy that tells of the last months of the second world war"
"rmax304823","Null","19","23","28 November 2001"," Accurate, flawed
","I applaud Attenborough for having made this movie. What a headache its filming must have been. It's accurate in a sense both material and overall.<br/><br/>His P 47s may be mock ups, but he used genuine World-War-II era M-4 ""Sherman"" tanks. (God knows how he managed to muster them.) I can't vouch for the German tank -- there is only one shown on screen and it could pass for a Panther. I also admire him for having the daring to make a movie about an unmitigated Allied defeat. As a whole, movies in this genre depict a victory on the part of the nations producing the movie in the first place.<br/><br/>""The Enemy Below,"" ""Zulu,"" ""Torpedo Bay,"" ""Die Brucke,"" just to give American, British, Italian, and German examples. The list goes on. About the only time we're permitted to witness defeats for ""our side"" is during a heroic last stand against overwhelming odds (""Bataan"") or when the defeat is the result of dirty pool (""Pearl Harbor""). But here, with no excuses, Attenborough delivers a different message entirely.<br/><br/>The performances are as good as can be expected from actors who have so little time to develop their characters. The battle scenes are realistic enough, without their shoving our noses into spilled intestines. <br/><br/>Attenborough is not a splashy director but he has a couple of things go on that are worth noticing. The Dutch citizens who first greet the Allied troops joyfully as liberators wind up being slaughtered and their cities destroyed by the war that is thrust on them. Civilian suffering tends to get short shrift unless one of them is Sofia Loren or somebody. Another worthwhile touch, a small one. The British politely take over one of those large super-scrubbed middle-class Dutch homes as a hospital -- ""just for the slightly wounded, Ma'am."" And as the first soldiers enter they step over two kids playing with a toy train on a thick creamy rug -- and a few drops of blood sprinkle the carpet. <br/><br/>Two other observations. ""The Longest Day"" is sometimes compared unfavorably to this film for a number of reasons, many of them justified. But ""The Longest Day"" was made under restrictions that had been lifted by the time this movie was produced. Zanuck wanted to show more of the slaughter at Omaha Beach but was prevented from doing so. He was similarly prevented by prevailing folkways from showing Allied troops as more brutal. And he originally filmed the closing scene of the movie not with a triumphant parade of victorious infantrymen marching up the slopes to a peppy military tune but with an forlorn, exhausted, empty grunt, sitting at the water's edge and listlessly tossing pebbles into the waves. The scene had to be deleted. A bothersome thing about ""A Bridge Too Far"" is that, at least as I've seen it on TV, I can't easily tell who is where. In Ryan's book it's easy enough to follow events and characters but, as edited, this movie is pretty confusing. When five of the major actors all show up together on a balcony, it came as a big surprise. I thought Connery and one or two of the others were still trapped behind German lines! I don't know whether this confusion is due to poor editing or a ministroke."

","A largely historically accurate depiction of the failed Operation Market Garden, this is a thrilling and engrossing epic war film which explores the absolute necessity of a great deal of preparation in staging a major military operation. Based on the 1974 book of the same name by Cornelius Ryan, it concerns an attempt by the Allied Forces to capture several strategically important bridges in the Netherlands in the hope of breaking the German lines. Had it been successful, it was hoped that World War II in Europe would be over by the end of 1944. However, as Kate ter Horst observes during her opening narration, victory by Christmas was a frequently expressed but seldom achieved hope in many previous wars and, sadly, this one was no different. Almost all of the participants' real names are used and several of them even served as military consultants. The film benefits from an absolutely fantastic script by William Goldman and first rate direction by Richard Attenborough in both the quieter character scenes and the hugely impressive battle scenes. The score by John Addison, himself a veteran of Market Garden appropriately enough, adds a great deal to the film.<br/><br/>There are many reasons for the failure of Market Garden but the general consensus among historians seems to be that the major one was that Field Marshal Montgomery's plan was inherently flawed and poorly thought out. Monty is not depicted as a character but there is a great of criticism, albeit most of it implicit, levelled against him throughout the film. In reality, he died the year before the film was released. I imagine that he would have certainly taken issue with it otherwise. What is depicted in the film is an extreme reluctance to question his plan. This is best illustrated when a Cassandra-esque young officer named Major Fuller, played by the great Irish character actor Frank Grimes, is forced to take a leave of absence for ""rocking the boat"" when he points out its numerous inconsistencies and elements which are more reminiscent of wishful thinking than sound strategic planning. However, much of the blame in the film is assigned to General Frederick Browning, who is wonderfully played by Dirk Bogarde. He is depicted, very negatively, as an arrogant and shortsighted man who refuses to entertain the suggestion that the plan will not work. At least not until after it has already failed when he comments, in the film's final line, ""Well, as you know, I always felt we tried to go a bridge too far."" Prior to that, Browning took great pride in the fact that the planning and organisation of the operation, the largest airborne offensive ever attempted up to that time, took one week. As the film develops, it becomes clearer and clearer that more time should have been taken in the planning stage. As in reality, it was surprisingly slapdash. All I kept thinking was, ""Someone had blundered / Theirs not to make reply / Theirs not to reason why / Theirs but to do and die."" Like Monty, Browning was dead by 1977 but his widow, the author Daphne du Maurier, unsurprisingly took huge exception to his depiction in the film.<br/><br/>The film has an all star cast but Sean Connery probably has the biggest role as Major General Roy Urquhart, the commander of the 1st British Airborne Division which finds itself cut off from the outside world due to useless radios and far fewer jeeps than were promised. This leads to his forces being besieged in Arnhem, the site of the most important bridge, for nine days instead of two. As a result, they suffer an 80% casualty rate. Connery gives a great performance as Urquhart, who becomes increasingly frustrated by the problems besetting his men but manages to keep his cool throughout. Anthony Hopkins is excellent as Colonel John Frost of the 2nd Parachute Battalion. In his first scene, he is depicted as being overly confident as to the prospect of victory as he tells his batman to pack his golf clubs and even his dinner jacket. However, his forces suffer the brunt of the German assaults at the Battle of Arnhem in some of the film's best scenes which unhesitatingly depict the brutality of war.<br/><br/>James Caan likewise gives a great performance as Staff Sergeant Eddie Dohun, whose loyalty to his critically wounded superior Captain Glass is touching. The only major cast member who does not speak a word of English in the film, Maximilian Schell is brilliant as General Wilhelm Bittrich of II SS Panzer Corps, who leads the attack on Arnhem. He displays a glimmer of decency when he orders a three hour ceasefire to allow for the evacuation of the wounded. Liv Ullman, the only woman to receive star billing, has very little screen time but she is wonderful as Kate ter Horst, the Dutchwoman who helped care for the wounded. The film also features strong performances from Laurence Olivier, Michael Caine, Edward Fox, Hardy Krüger, Wolfgang Preiss, Robert Redford, Elliott Gould, Christopher Good, Paul Copley, Denholm Elliott and Stephen Moore, among many others in a film with dozens of speaking parts. The weakest link is Ryan O'Neal, who seems a bit lost, while the generally very dependable Gene Hackman's Polish accent leaves a great deal to be desired. Attenborough has a one second cameo as an escaped mental patient, his only appearance in a film that he directed. Unlike many actors turned directors, he clearly had no interest in directing star vehicles for himself.<br/><br/>Overall, this is an absolutely brilliant film which does not hesitate to portray the Allies in a less than flattering light. I suspect that this is the reason that, like Attenborough's classic anti-war film ""Oh! What a Lovely War"", it was completely ignored by the Oscars. I think that it deserved a Best Picture nomination, again among many others."

","Last week, September 13 to 19, 2004, Operation Market Garden happened exactly 60 years ago. It was maybe the last remembrance of Operation Market Garden with a sizable number of veterans present from as far afield as Australia, the USA, Britain, and Poland. It was VERY impressive to see them marching or driving over the John Frost Bridge in the centre of Arnhem, where the battle had its climax. The veterans I talked to told me they really enjoyed the warmth with which they were received, by both the young and old Dutch people. Many were moved emotionally.. and many visit the remembrance annually, as far as their health permits (they are all in their 80s of course).<br/><br/>Other memorable events were the air droppings on the Ginkelse Heide (heath), and the ceremony at the military cemetery at Oosterbeek, attended by the Queen of Holland and the Prince of Wales.<br/><br/>For those who are interested, here are some good websites with info on the battle:<br/><br/>http://www.marketgarden.com<br/><br/>http://members.lycos.nl/marketgarden44<br/><br/>http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/war/wwtwo/battle_arnhem_01.shtml<br/><br/>http://www.rememberseptember44.com<br/><br/>Hope someone found this useful.

","A Bridge Too Far (1977)<br/><br/>Plot In A Paragraph: The story of the Battle of Arnhem during World War II. <br/><br/>Connery has one of the more substantial roles in Richard Attenborough's all star cast. (Said to be the most expensive cast in living memory) Thwre were famous actors everywhere. Gene Hackman, Michael Caine, Robert Redford, James Caan, Elliot Gould, Anthony Hopkins, Edward Fox, Laurence Olivier and Dirk Bogarde amongst others. Connery was General Urquhart in his first combat drop, and again he delivers a solid performance. <br/><br/>Like watching Saving Private Ryan, all I think watching this movie is what a waste of human life. The amount of soldiers whose lives were lost in this operation due to bad planning based on poor intelligence and faulty radios leading to a complete breakdown in communication is staggering!! When told his superior was ""proud and pleased"" Connery growled that he went in when 10,000 men and came out with less than 2,000. <br/><br/>In a year dominated by the first Star Wars ($300 million) and Smokey & The Bandit ($127 million) A Bridge To Far still managed to gross $50,000, despite being in direct competition with them, to become Connery's biggest hit outside of the Bond Franchise. It ended 1977 as the 7th highest grossing movie of the year. Another best for Connery as no movie he started in outside of the Bond moves had broke the Top 10 grossers of the year."

","Extremely bad plot. Ryan O'Neil is a full general at maybe 30 years old? Impossible to believe. No overview of the ultimate objective. The movie focuses on many lesser scenes--like Sean Connery running from a tank in an alley--that have nothing to do with the plot. Scenes that could be a part of any movie and do not relate to the objective of the bridges. Too many big-name stars that dilute their roles to supporting and nothing more. No coherence between the scenes. The plot is completely lost in all the small scenes and scenarios. Well acted by the stars, but I'm sure they knew it was a horrible script. It's just a disaster of a movie. If you like war scenes, you'll like it, but as a historical story of Montgomery's failed plan to capture these bridges and shorten the war, it completely misses the point. Also, where is Montgomery...the British general who thought up the operation? We need a foil to blame not only the failure of the operation on, but also the failure of the film. The film is as disastrous and expensive as the actual operation."
"bowmanblue","9","7","9","8 November 2014"," One of the best accounts of a military failure ever
","'A Bridge Too Far' was never a blistering success at the box office when it was originally released in 1977. People felt that World War II films were a little 'old hat' by then, so there wasn't as much interest in it as there possible could have been if it was released a couple of decades earlier.<br/><br/>Plus, when the history textbooks are studied, you hear a lot about the D-Day landings, the Battle of Britain and so forth. However, 'Operation Market-Garden' rarely gets a mention. It was an audacious plan by the Allies to take four bridges in only a few days time in the middle of German-held Europe, thus ensuring a vital route of supplies is maintained to the Allied forces fighting on the frontline.<br/><br/>A plan of this magnitude and intricacy could only be done justice on an epic scale. And, to the film's credit, it does just that. It has a stellar ensemble cast, including such greats as Sean Connery, Anthony Hopkins and Michael Caine, all of which play different Allied military personnel at various points of the mission.<br/><br/>Without wishing to give too much away, perhaps one aspect of the film's success may be down to the fact that the 'goodies' don't necessarily win. It's unlikely that most of us would appreciate a World War II film where the Germans come out on top, however, history was not kind to Operation Market-Garden. It went ahead and, in one Allied General's own words ""Was over 90% successful."" Unfortunately, a catalogue of errors – some manmade and others beyond the Allies' control – contributed to it being labelled one of the biggest mission failures of the latter half of the war.<br/><br/>If you like your war films, you should love this. It's big, powerful and doesn't pull many punches when it shows the horror of what soldiers on all sides went through. You need to be okay with ensemble casts. There could probably be a film made about every character featured in this film. But there isn't enough time for that, so we do have to sacrifice a little character development in favour of condensing the mission down into a watchable viewing.<br/><br/>'Saving Private Ryan' may have a better budget, but A Bridge Too Far has a raw, epic feel that really makes it come across like a history lesson which more battles and stars."
"vinceb-3","1","22","36","1 April 2010"," Boring!
","I purchased a United Artists Cinema Greats Collection that included Judgment at Nuremburg, Paths of Glory, 12 Angry Men and A Bridge Too Far. Oh well, three out of four ain't bad. Considering this film lasts nearly three hours, it's amazing how little we learn about either the Germans or Allies involved in one of WWII's biggest blunders. It's like 10 different movies in one, and the result is unsatisfactory. Perhaps the producers thought that securing the services of several A-list actors would produce box-office gold. Simply, it doesn't work. The Elliott Gould character, for example, is neither interesting nor funny. Supposedly a brilliant, cigar-chomping, wise-cracking American hotshot, he is a buffoon with a ridiculous smirk etched on his face. I mean, did somebody actually think this would be hilarious? The superb talents of Robert Redford and Laurence Olivier are completely wasted, and the James Caan vs. doctor scene made me cringe. Speaking of Caan, I watched the scene three times where he eludes capture by driving a jeep through the teeth of a German unit. By my unofficial count the Germans were 0-for-367 in their attempt to gun down Caan, with most of the shots from point-blank range. It was fitting since this movie is one giant misfire."
"funky_dunc","9","11","16","5 October 2005"," A film too good
","A Bridge Too Far tells the story of Operation Market Garden, a campaign dreamed up by Montgomery to take a series of bridges over the Rhine that would allow the Allies to invade Germany's industrial zone and thus end World War Two by Christmas 1944.<br/><br/>Suffice to say the mission failed and A Bridge Too Far deals mainly with the failed attempt to take the bridge in Arnhem, Holland.<br/><br/>The film is typical Richard Attenbourgh. It has the feel of David Lean: long shots, dazzling cinematography and an epic length (over four hours). The film also features one of the most stellar casts ever. A virtual who's who of 'seventies cinema, plus a few of Dickie's luvvie mates (Olivier, Bogarde). Admittedly most are not in the film for very long but all make an impact. This is especially true of Robert Redford as he crosses the Rhine shouting ""Hail Mary, full of grace!"" The two standouts though are Sean Connery and Anthony Hopkins. Connery fully convinces us that he is Roy Urquart, a battle hardened general, a million miles from 007. Hopkins is truly outstanding as a stereotypical British colonel fighting a losing battle. He shows the arrogance and self belief of the officer class and its hard to believe that he went onto be Hannibal Lector.<br/><br/>The film offers an unrelenting view of war. Attenborough pulls no punches. The film has no Saving Private Ryan style effects but somehow is more powerful for having less gore. He also makes sure everyone involved, British, Americans, Poles and Germans, gets an equal amount of treatment. There is none of the trite patriotism that exists in other war films here.<br/><br/>A Bridge Too Far is perhaps the ultimate World War Two film. No glorious victories, no petty heroism, just a clear document of the reality of warfare."

","Picked this up at a DVD store, had no idea it would be this good. I was a bit astonished at IMDb's rating of the film... 7.3?! WHAT?!! Should have been in the Top 250 for all I know. Because the ingredients of a dazzling film is all here, in this movie.<br/><br/>To start off, the cast. Sean Connery! Michael Caine! Gene Hackman! Robert Redford! Anthony Hopkins! Elliot Gould! Laurence Olivier! Dirk Bogard! Ryan O' Neal! Edward Fox! An A-list cast ensemble of their time, on the screen for our enjoyment. Need I say more? The story is good, it is accurate to the real battles (as well as the novel), and it has its fair share of dramatic moments to boot without getting too melodramatic. The dialog is good, and it's great to see Germans speaking their own language for once instead of English like the greatly flawed film Midway.<br/><br/>The music by John Addison is also commendable, as it is throbbing and heroic, really suits the military scenes as well, and it is not heard during the action scenes, this is good as it prevents the grittiness of war from being distracted by the glorious score of the film.<br/><br/>The cinematography is lush, beautiful, and scenic. This makes the battle scenes majestic and the slow moments poignant. The scenes with the paratroopers preparing for the jump makes your jaw drop in amazement and wonder as you say, ""How'd the hell they'd do that?"" And that's in the 70's, folks! The direction by sir Richard Attenborough is wonderful, kinetic and gripping. The battle scenes are astounding, with real army tanks and real soldiers as extras duking it out on the battlefield. It is truly a sight to behold. As for the paratrooper scenes, I don't know how he did it. The action is raw, in-your-face and intense, and quite graphic at times. That's the real spirit of war.<br/><br/>In short, it's a war near-masterpiece, a criminally underrated one at that. Give this a try.

"BDrifter","Null","8","11","18 January 2004"," Re-enactment of the attempt to end WWII by Christmas 1944
","In the autumn of 1944 Field Marshall Montgomery conceived a plan called Operation Market Garden that would open a corridor across the Rhine river and allow Allied troops to attack the heartland of Germany. When he and his staff devised the plan the Allied forces were being held in their positions by both German resistance and lack of supplies. At the time it appeared the war would evolve into the same static-front contest of attrition which occured in the first world war and led to horrible loss of life on all sides.<br/><br/>A Bridge Too Far is such an accurate portrayal of the events which occurred during Operation Market Garden that much of the criticism for the film is veiled criticism of the plan itself and of the actions of the participants. The criticism of Montgomery is undeserved, as he was a capable, if seemingly over cautious general. The plan was the boldest of any that were made during the war and the reasons Eisenhower approved it instead of one by Montgomery's rival Patton are valid. The results of the operation have been incorrectly regarded by some as a failure, but in fact it made the defense of Germany untenable and facilitated the final push into Germany during the spring of 1945.<br/><br/>The film itself is well written and contains imagery of battles and troop movements of a scale that has not been equaled, at least in any realistic manner. Earlier comments have been made that Attenborough's attention to detail has resulted in an overly lengthy film but I disagree with that assessment. Any film which depicts a part of the war which directly effected the second half of the 20th century should be given as much time as necessary to tell it's story. There is only one part of the film that has no direct bearing on the narrative of events and that is the sub plot involving James Caan's character, which does add 20 minutes to the running time of 3 hours.<br/><br/>The scenes showing the drop of the British and American airborne forces are visually stunning and worth the price of a DVD for their own sake. Anthony Hopkins is at his best as the unenviable forward commander at the final bridge at Arnhem. My only regret is that the actual glider landings were not depicted, presumably because of the risk involved.<br/><br/>The film should be considered required viewing by anyone who claims to be a war film fan, or anyone interested in the events which occurred during the second world war."
"SimonJack","10","9","13","14 November 2015"," One of the best historical war movies ever made
","""A Bridge Too Far"" is one of the best war movies ever made. It's based on a 1974 historical novel by Cornelius Ryan who also wrote ""The Longest Day"" in 1959. Ryan was highly regarded for the detail of research for his books. He strove for accuracy and authenticity. Ryan was born in Dublin in 1920 and became a British war correspondent for The Daily Telegraph in 1941. He went on 14 bombing missions with the U.S. Army Air Forces. On D-Day (June 6, 1944), he flew over the Normandy beaches in a bomber. Then, after returning to England, he went to Normandy on a patrol boat the same day. He later covered Lt. Gen. George Patton's Third Army, and then reported on the war in the Pacific. <br/><br/>Ryan's ""The Longest Day"" sold millions of copies and was the basis for the 1962 movie by the same name. He wrote the screenplay for that blockbuster film that won two Oscars. In an item in Time Magazine of Dec. 9, 1974, Ryan was quoted: ""What I write about is not war but the courage of man."" There can be no doubt about that in his two books that were made into two of the best historical war films of all time. Besides the logistics, planning, and background details and facts, Ryan incorporates the characters and personalities of individual men in his stories. He covers Allied and Axis forces alike, from generals to sergeants to privates.<br/><br/>""A Bridge Too Far"" is about Operation Market Garden. It has gritty, tough, scenes of men in battle on both sides. Much time is devoted to the fighting of the British 1st Airborne Division in the Battle of Arnhem. The advance airborne battalion under Lt. Col. John D. Frost (played superbly by Anthony Hopkins) captures one end of the Arnhem bridge and then holds out for nine days. All this with ammunition running out and no resupply or reinforcements, while the Germans throw heavy artillery, tanks and mechanized infantry attacks at them. Elsewhere, the rest of the division commanded by Major General Roy Urquhart (played superbly by Sean Connery) is divided, cut off and surrounded by German forces. <br/><br/>Operation Market Garden failed because the Allies did not capture the Rhine bridge at Arnhem and had to retreat. It was planned to spearhead a drive to capture the Ruhr Valley and shut down Germany's war production plants. The American 101st and 82nd Airborne divisions did secure river crossings at Eindhoven and Nijmegen, respectively. But the British XXX Corps met with strong German opposition and slowed to a crawl on the ground. It failed to reach the British paratroopers 64 miles away in just two days as planned. So, the whole operation bogged down, with only the ground gained to Nijmegen. <br/><br/>""A Bridge Too Far,"" covers the entire Operation Market Garden. For the first time, the public got a look at the foibles and errors in planning this major wartime operation. The film shows the questions raised by various commands and officers at the time. The major foul- ups were many, and the outcome was disastrous for the British and Polish paratroopers. Just over 2,000 of the 10,000 plus British and Polish force were able to escape when ordered to retreat. The rest were killed, wounded or captured. <br/><br/>Not a single radio worked for the British Airborne forces, so they couldn't communicate among their units or with headquarters. How could they go into combat without tested and working equipment? The film shows how. The planners put the landing zone for the Brits eight miles from their target bridge. So a surprise strike and quick capture of the bridge wasn't to be. But the Germans would have time to cut off units and surround them. There weren't enough aircraft for all the forces to strike together the first day. So, units were dropped over three days. Again, there was no surprise or catching the Germans off guard. Instead, they had time to surround the British landing zone. The top brass dismissed aerial photography that showed hidden German tanks. The operation leaders didn't believe or trust the underground reports they received. Yet the Dutch had been reliable for four years. And, when unit commanders expressed concerns, the top brass dismissed them. There were many signs of military incompetence at various levels in this film, but mostly at the top. <br/><br/>""A Bridge Too Far"" is an independent film made by Joseph Levine and Directed by acclaimed English actor and director, Richard Attenborough. The production team and crew read like a British telephone directory. The cast includes 20 big name American and British actors of the day. Numerous Allied commanders from Market Garden, now retired, served as consultants during the making of the film. Besides Urquhart and Frost, already mentioned, these included Maj. Gen. Brian Horrocks (played superbly by Edward Fox), Brig. Gen. James Gavin (37 years old at the time, and played very well by Ryan O'Neal), and Brigadier Joe Vandeleur (played superbly by Michael Caine). <br/><br/>The movie was filmed at several locations in The Netherlands. There are some small equipment goofs, but the military equipment and armament are very impressive. The special effects are ""dynamite."" The filming of the C-47 ""Dakota"" transport planes and the towed gliders is wonderful. The parachute jump is one of the best and most impressive I've seen on film (I am a former paratrooper). And the musical score for the film is excellent. <br/><br/>This movie didn't receive a single Academy Award nomination in 1974. And it was a year that had very few good films. So, Hollywood blew it by ignoring this great movie. The film did win three BAFTA awards with four more nominations. ""A Bridge Too Far"" will likely be held as one of the great historical war movies of all time."

The motion picture was professionally directed by Richard Attemborough . <br/><br/>The flick was based on historical events , these are the followings : Operation Market Garden (17–25 September 1944) was an unsuccessful Allied military operation, fought in the Netherlands and Germany in the Second World War. It was the largest airborne operation up to that time. Field Marshal Montgomery's goal was to force an entry into Germany and over the Rhine. He wanted to circumvent the northern end of the Siegfried Line and this required the operation to seize the bridges across the Maas (Meuse River) and two arms of the Rhine (the Waal and the Lower Rhine) as well as several smaller canals and tributaries. Crossing the Lower Rhine would allow the Allies to encircle Germany's industrial heartland in the Ruhr from the north. It made large-scale use of airborne forces, whose tactical objectives were to secure the bridges and allow a rapid advance by armored units into Northern Germany.Initially, the operation was marginally successful and several bridges between Eindhoven and Nijmegen were captured. However, Gen. Horrocks' XXX Corps ground force's advance was delayed by the demolition of a bridge over the Wilhelmina Canal, as well as an extremely overstretched supply line, at Son, delaying the capture of the main road bridge over the Meuse until 20 September. At Arnhem, the British 1st Airborne Division encountered far stronger resistance than anticipated. In the ensuing battle, only a small force managed to hold one end of the Arnhem road bridge and after the ground forces failed to relieve them, they were overrun on 21 September. The rest of the division, trapped in a small pocket west of the bridge, had to be evacuated on 25 September. The Allies had failed to cross the Rhine in sufficient force and the river remained a barrier to their advance until the offensives at Remagen, Oppenheim, Rees and Wesel in March 1945. The failure of Market Garden ended Allied expectations of finishing the war by Christmas 1944."
"SgtSlaughter","7","9","13","28 June 2003"," Accurate, Stunning and Shallow Epic
","Director Richard Attenborough's ambitious WWII drama is the last of the real epics. There would never again be a big-budget Hollywood re-creation of an actual campaign with as many international stars and colossal battle scenes. As a critic, I don't know whether to be disappointed or thankful.<br/><br/>This is a really fine film. Despite its lengthy running time, it's historically accurate and loaded with amazing performances. If you're a history buff, the length shouldn't bother you; but if you enjoy typical Hollywood heroics, don't even bother picking this one up.<br/><br/>In the fall of 1944, Montgomery devises a plan to bring an end to the Second World War swiftly. The plan requires Allied paratroopers to drop 300 miles behind the German lines in Holland, where they will secure three important brides. Then, armored units will punch through, linking up the three brides and providing a stable route into the heart of German's center of manufacturing. As the Allied forces launch their attack, Attenborough fills the screen with amazing wide shots of tanks, planes and parachutes. The execution of the plan is a beautiful affair, and at first it's hard to believe that this operation would turn into one of history's biggest disasters. As soon as the first parachutist lands, things begin to go wrong.<br/><br/>Performances are stellar all-around. On the British side, Anthony Hopkins is a standout as Colonel Frost, whose paratroopers capture the end of one bridge but get more than they bargained for. He and his men hold out despite overwhelming assaults by the SS and Panzer units. Dirk Bogarde (""The Password is Courage"") makes Lt. Gen Browning despicable jerk, as he sneers at anyone who criticizes Montgomery's plan; he says with self-assurance ""We shall seize the bridges with thunderclap surprise and hold them until they can be secured,"" as if nobody stands in the way. Sean Connery (""The Longest Day"") and Michael Caine (""Zulu"") turn in fine performances as well. Gene Hackman (""First to Fight"") is a Polish Colonel who is skeptical of the plan, and easily the best performer among the large ensemble. Attenborough also pays tribute to the Americans, although Ryan O'Neal, Elliott Gould and James Caan (""Submarine X-1"") are all limited to cameo roles. Robert Redford (""War Hunt"") is a standout in a short segment as Major Cook, whose men have to make an assault on a German garrison in small rubber boats under heavy artillery and machine-gun fire. The Germans are portrayed as humans, not demonic Nazis: Maximilian Schell (""Cross of Iron"") is a dedicated officer who is merciful to prisoners; Hardy Kruger (""The Battle of Neretva"") is dedicated to holding his bridge; and Wolfgang Preiss (""Anzio"") gets to do a bit of Hitler-bashing near the film's opening.<br/><br/>Attenborough places his characters in the midst of huge, chaotic battle sequences. The camera captures hundreds of planes, tanks, vehicles and extras, but also goes into the trenches with the grunts. Both the spectacle and personal struggle are emphasized. The best of these sequences, hands-down, is the aforementioned river crossing. An American battalion must cross the Rhine in flimsy rubber rafts, while German fire rains down; once they get across the river, they have to punch through the German lines and then move onto a bridge rigged for demolition. This sequence is intense and magnificently shot, with a great concluding scene.<br/><br/>There are two major thorns in the side of this film, though, which hampers it's effectiveness from the first scenes until the conclusion. It's frustratingly slow-paced, and seems to take days to slog through a three-hour running time. The plot is about planning a mission, sitting around and waiting to execute it, then executing it and having to wait some more for information, reinforcements, supplies the movie about waiting for things to happen, not about things happening.Roughly the first third of the film is spent clarifying who the main characters are and what they will do. Since the actual campaign was so massive, the film has to be massive to cover all of the details too massive, in fact. The other flaw is that there are so many characters, and so much going on, that you can't really appreciate the sacrifices made because before there's a chance for an impact to be made, the actors are shuffled offstage to make room for the next big cameo appearance. The three aforementioned massacre sequences, Caan's one big scene in the hospital and Hopkins' character are the only ones who make any major impact.<br/><br/>Still, one can't help but enjoy a movie like this, at least to an extent. It's got some of the biggest and best choreographed battle scenes ever shot and contains some of Hollywood's biggest stars of the 1970s. It may look and sound like a history lesson, but it's an interesting and exciting lesson to learn."

","This is a very waterlogged war film, notable today only for its mammoth star line up and for being a rare war film in that it depicts a German victory. The director has attempted to make the film as comprehensive a telling of Operation Market Garden as possible, but has instead (or because of this) left us with an over-crowded and at times heavy-handed mess.<br/><br/>The film starts out well, conveying well the war-office politics which, borne out of an arrogant zeal to end the war swiftly, ended up dooming the entire operation. Pointing out sound reasons to delay the launching of the air drop, which would save thousands of lives, was regarded as 'rocking the boat.' Notable was the character of Fuller, who saw the presence of German tanks as a good reason to call off the mission. When he pushed for this, he was forced to take 'some leave' for exhaustion. The mission went ahead - straight into a few German Panzer divisions. Following Fuller's advice (based on sound intelligence), would have saved a few thousand men, and probably the mission; but Allied command wanted the boys home for Christmas, and Fuller was rocking the boat - touché.<br/><br/>Indeed there are also some fine battle sequences incorporating great special effects. But these are few and far between in this three hour movie. These good points, including the wonderful cast and a brilliant score, are just not enough to make this film worthwhile as anything but a curio. The rest is all downhill.....<br/><br/>The screenplay is simply awful - there is just too much going on in the events which are the subject of the film, and this muddles the movie. Even if you are following the film closely, at times you are left wondering if you've in fact missed something when a quick rewind to recap shows that you haven't. A lot of self indulgent, meandering direction from Attenborough doesn't help the matter either. He also seems to enjoy over-exposing the film in many scenes, so that sunlight glows in a blurry manner, creating a sepia kind of image. This looks terrible, and is reminiscent of some dreadful films by Tony Richardson.<br/><br/>The star line up, though magnificent is ultimately unnecessary. It only ends up distracting the audience from the film's plot. Sundry big names appear in totally unnecessary cameos, most of which simply detract from the main plot; this, I feel, adding to the confusion of an already muddled screenplay. Laurence Olivier and James Caan appear in two completely pointless almost-cameo roles. Both the roles are completely beneath these actors, and the pretentiousness of the director to include these scenes (especially Caan's) is clearly evident in their suplerfity. The dialogue between James Caan's character and the field doctor was simply inane, and should have just been cut.<br/><br/>The scene towards the end, in which the leading officers of the operation stand atop a bell tower and contemplate why the mission failed, is simply a straight rip-off from the ending of The Charge of the Light Brigade in that each tries to blame some other aspect of the planning which led to their own section failing. The actual final ending of the film was bland, and very heavy-handed. Totally unsatisfying - especially after three hours.<br/><br/>And all through the film the national-specific clichés of the characters was abysmal. The two American leads (Ryan O'Neal and Elliot Gould) were just cardboard-cut-out US stooges - cigar chomping, loudmouths always rattling on about 'American ingenuity' and the need 'to try', and wishing to emulate George Washington in battle. The British were no better - if not worse. There was just so much 'Chin up laddy', and 'better luck next time old boy - eh' going on that the film began to play like a parody of a war film; so much so, that by the end of the film you are relieved that the Nazis have won the day - if, of course, you are still awake to care by this stage.<br/><br/>This film requires patience, as most films with such run time do; but most other long films have the virtue of being able to hold your attention by providing a solid evening's entertainment. A Bridge Too Far doesn't have this virtue, because it has attempted to crowd too much into its clumsily handled screenplay. It is a worthwhile film for war buffs, as there are a few rewarding battle scenes; but one has to wade through veritable spools of self-important and confusing - sometimes down-right boring - celluloid to get to them. To the casual viewer this is not an enjoyable prospect, and not even the star power of the film can make such a task worthwhile."
"TankGuy","10","10","15","14 February 2015"," ""The forest that once was green, was coloured black by those killing machines""
","By September 1944, the allies were exploding with confidence due to the D-Day victory. Field Marshall Montgomery devised an ambitious plan to thrust into Germany and end the war by Christmas. Christening this plan ""Operation Market Garden"", allied brass intended to parachute hundreds of troops into occupied Holland where they would capture a series of strategically important bridges. Once these bridges were secured, more troops would push across the Lower Rhine and into Germany where they would destroy the Nazi's munitions plants. Montgomery was positive that the plan would succeed, however this was not to be the case. The fact that the allies hoped to establish a total victory all too soon led to Operation Market Garden becoming one of the most calamitous tactical failures in military history.<br/><br/>Executed in the same style as The Longest Day, ABTF chronicles the disastrous events of Operation Market Garden in awesome fashion. Like Ken Annakin in 1962, Richard Attenborough gives us a sturdy history lesson. Dickie's lesson however, is wrapped in poignant anti-war subtext. Until this point, anti-war movies only saw fit to show the debilitating effects of war on the soldiers. ABTF cuts much deeper by depicting the effects of warfare on civilians, thus the film succeeds amazingly. These anti-war overtones are at their most powerful when the town of Arnhem is razed to the ground by German tanks, but hit hardest when a distraught elderly woman and her confused son are thrust into the fighting after their home is overrun by Lieutenant Colonel Frost and his forces. Also later in the movie, a young Dutch woman is forced to turn her house into a makeshift hospital for allied casualties. Yes, the film's anti-war subtext is laid on extremely thick, but the ugliness of war is it's selling point. Richard Attenborough goes further to criticise the decisions made by the allied high command. Most of the Generals who appear in the movie are depicted as overzealous toffs who stubbornly send their soldiers to be massacred at the expense of efficiency. The highlight of the film comes when James Caan's Sergeant threatens to shoot the U.S Medical Colonel unless he removes the bullet from Caan's dying Captain's skull. Proficiently executed with meritorious tact, the entire sequence is a robust testament to consequential writing and sharp acting. It also brilliantly showcases the crippling pressure under which real life soldiers have to fight. ABTF is light years ahead of it's time in terms of cinematography. The scenes showing the allies landing in Holland boasted a series of most impressive subjective POV shots of paratroopers plunging through the air. The said shots certainly wouldn't look out of place in a contemporary first person shooter game.<br/><br/>As with The Longest Day, ABTF is blessed with the advantage of star power. Awe striking portrays come from Sean Connery, Robert Redford, James Caan and Edward Fox. Gene Hackman stood out as Major General Sosabowski, as did Elliott Gould as the cigar chomping Colonel Bobby Stout. The latter is the stereotypical American Colonel, although clichéd as he may appear, Gould's professionalism transforms Colonel Stout into a staunch character. Other vivid performances included Anthony Hopkins as Lieutenant Colonel John Frost, Michael Caine as Lieutenant Colonel J.O.E Vandeleur, Maximillian Schell as Lieutenant General Bittrich, Arthur Hill as the American Medical Colonel and Liv Ullmann as Kate Ter Horst. Laurence Olivier gave a profound performance as the kindly Doctor Spaander and so did Hardy Kruger as Major General Ludwig and Michael Byrne as Lieutenant Colonel Giles Vandeleur. Be sure to look out for a pre Cheers John Ratzenburger as a U.S Lieutenant and Donald Pickering as Lieutenant Colonel Mackenzie. Tight editing allows the battle scenes to be both engaging and taut. The stunts and special effects have the full power to excite with the engagements on the Arnhem bridge and amphibious assault on the German held river bank plus the subsequent attack on the Nijmegen bridge packing spectacularly cuspidate suspense!. The action scenes, especially the streetfighting(which is some of the most realistic I've ever seen in a war movie!), were given a brutal edge thanks to the use of modern camera techniques and moderate inclusion of gore.<br/><br/>ABTF is a biting comment on the hideousness of war, but can also be read as a severe essay on the repercussions of overenthusiasm and conformity. Handled with commendable tact by Richard Attenborough, ABTF has more than enough strength to pull any war movie or history buff in. 10/10."

It was the biggest airborne assault in history. <br/><br/>Director Richard Attenborough try to make a grand scale war movie. The stellar cast is not to be missed. The scale of this film is massive. It is before the time of the computer. It does take a little while to set up. There's a lot of things to show before the action starts. But once the action starts, the film moves along quite well.<br/><br/>Vandeleur (Michael Caine) leads the advance on the narrow road to reach the bridges. Frost (Anthony Hopkins) leads his men and reaches the bridge in Arnhem. Urquhart (Sean Connery)'s men land near an asylum and can't get to the bridge. Sosabowski (Gene Hackman)'s men are held back by the weather.<br/><br/>This is one of the best grand war movies. It comes out the wonderful traditions of The Longest Day and Tora! Tora! Tora!

"newtondunbar","9","6","8","14 April 2013"," An Under Rated War Film
","Roger Ebert trashed this film when it came out for being too violent and containing too many stereotypes. He obviously was asleep during the film as he completely missed what Director Attenborough achieved in this excellent item of WW II history. Attenborough didn't simply tell the story of why this Allied operation failed, he explained the reasons as well. This was difficult to do on film because the root explanation concerned a state of mind that existed in the high command a that point in the war. It was state of 'insouciance'; a smug, self confidence in their own infallibility. This lead to a serious under-estimating of the enemy and an unwarranted over confidence in the plan. Attenborough portrayed this partly through the brilliant acting of Dirk Bogarde who played General Browning, one of the instruments of the failure. People, even legends like Ebert need to pay attention when they plan to review a film."

","I just finished watching ""A Bridge Too Far"" for the first time, and got on here to check out if that was, indeed, Gene Hackman, and a less-than-glamorous remark was under user comments.<br/><br/>Let me remind you that, being a student of history, especially WW2 history, the movie is rather accurate.  It does involve a bit of speculation, of course, and the screenwriter did take the usual poetic license with character development.  But as far as I can tell, the big names were not just stuck in there ""to make a boring movie appealing"".  If I remember correctly, those ""characters"" (the generals/soldiers portrayed) actually did exist and play major roles in the battle.  And hey, if you're making a movie that has six or seven large roles, why not try to get the biggest names for those roles that you can?<br/><br/>You have to realize, this is history.  As one writer commented, yes, after a while the audience might feel battle weary... but how do you think the GI, the British soldier, felt after almost two weeks of constant, intense battle?  I did, personally, feel as weary as Sean Connery near the end... or how about the officer who cracked his spine in the jump?  Don't you think he felt weary?<br/><br/>Attenborough did an excellent job, I felt, of portraying the battle.  It was a perfect example of how General Montgomery often reached past what was reasonably possible, and in this case, it was particularly disastrous. Caen on D-day... HA!  But in that case it didn't result in such terrible losses.<br/><br/>While you shouldn't watch this unless you have almost three hours to spare, it is a good portrayal of the battle, and remains the single most glaring demonstration that you should never plan a battle by relying on a single road."

Too bad he picked Dickie Attenborough to direct, the man who has no sense whatsoever of crisp pacing, the man who never met stentorian music that he wouldn't over-use, the man whose photograph can be found in any good dictionary next to ""lugubrious."" Attenborough manages to suck every iota of momentum out of this story; his work here is one of the truly awesome spectacles in the history of bad directing. Just in case you get roped into watching this bloated piece of junk you can perhaps amuse yourself by laughing at the terrible performances (memo to Ryan O'Neal - generals during the Second World War did not strut like '70s L.A. beach studs) and nodding your head at the three or four not-half-bad performances. Michael Caine. Sean Connery. James Caan - his work here is way too mannered but intensely charismatic; one can see in that massive and rugged face why he was thought of for a while as the next Brando.

We have a series of protagonists who each get their obligatory 2 lines of dialogue before cutting to the next sequence.<br/><br/>The actors were not at fault - and one wonders why such big names from the Hollywood pantheon like Olivier and Redford agreed to be cast as characters with very 'little meat to their bones' so to speak. Contrary to the praise Goldman received for writing this film - in my view he's actually written a big turkey. The poor box office receipts would tally with this view. The public know a bad 'un when they see it!<br/><br/>A shorter running time, a stronger point-of-view narrative from say Bogarde's character General Browning, would have made this film far more effective. It seems that Attenborough was so keen to get his historical facts right, that he forgot to think of the needs of film lovers and cinema-goers. The only way this film could have succeeded was as a drama-documentary.<br/><br/>Overly ambitious project, obsessed with the details of the key events, renders this a forgettable war pic. <br/><br/>If you ever get the chance try and see the rarely seen and vastly under-rated 'All Quiet On The Western Front' starring Richard Thomas and Ian Holm.

","The above is from the back of a similar book about the Battle of Arnhem called A Bridge At Arnhem. It was the biggest blunder ever. The ironic thing about it is this: The plan wasn't conceived by a general known for his bold strokes of genius like James Gavin. Who conceived of this ill-conceived plan? Back on September 10, 1944, the top Allied commanders met at SHAEF headquarters. It had been conceived of by none other than General Montgomery as a means to end the end the war. The plan, code-named Operation Market Garden, was to drop paratroopers in broad daylight. A big mistake. It should have been done in the pre- dawn darkness. Some have argued that the British didn't inform the Dutch Resistance. Why? When it was already compromised by the Germans? Did the planning overlook the ferry that ran daily on the Lower Rhine? Probably yes. The Germans knew about it and they weren't about to give up The Netherlands without a fight. The Allies' drop zones, (DZ's), were two miles from their destinations. Why? What was the purpose? To seize three bridges. The Grand Prize was the bridge at Arnhem itself but the British First Airborne, under the command of General Roy E. Urquhart, the commander of the British First Airborne, was supposed to hold the bridge for seven days until they were relieved by XXX Corps. But XXX Corps never arrived, because it had been effectively stopped by the Germans. What was General Browning's reaction to the failure of Market Garden? ""I think we may have gone a bridge too far.

PATTON is saved by a gigantic central performance. It turns out that a protagonist is a useful thing in an epic. It's a big drawback of the all-star cast that nobody really stars. There are too few scenes with each character to define character, so it's hard to care.<br/><br/>Attenborough takes pains to keep us informed of the big picture - small errors add up to gross negligence and eventually cost thousands of lives - but what's happening in any given moment is less clear. When James Caan's stuck in that Jeep - is he between two sets of Nazis or three? Why does he go for the gun, then change his mind and make a run for it? Clearly, there was insufficient coverage to make the scene coherent or interesting. The economical decision after the fact would be to cut the scene.

","""A Bridge Too Far"" is a bit of an odd bird: an all-star blockbuster epic about an epic failure. It probably demolished the whole genre of epic war films single-handed, at least for about twenty years or so. It's a bit of a downer, to be honest. But compared to ""The Longest Day"" or ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" or ""The Battle of Britain"", it's a better film, with stronger performances, finer craft, and greater feeling.<br/><br/>Director Richard Attenborough, himself a veteran of the war, shows Operation Market Garden from as many angles as he can. The film actually begins with a Dutch family in Arnhem, before moving on to the Allied and German generals. From the plans and briefings the story moves into the field with the paratroopers, and Sir Richard manages the great feat of rendering all the scene changes and different points of view quite clear. Recognizable actors -- Sean Connery, Anthony Hopkins, Robert Redford, Elliott Gould, Michael Caine -- help more than hinder the production, though I'm sure some viewers will find their presence distracting and unnecessary.<br/><br/>Most remarkable is the balance achieved between praise and criticism. The heroism and bravery of the soldiers is never questioned -- nor, for that matter, is the sincerity of the generals who led the operation. The catastrophic failure is depicted as a combination of poor planning, uncooperative weather, and faulty intelligence that underestimated the size of the German opposition. No one is made a scapegoat: a failure of this size is a group effort.<br/><br/>This approach makes portions of ""A Bridge Too Far"" quite stirring and exciting, if you like that sort of thing. The sight of Dakotas dropping hundreds of paratroopers over Holland is a stunning spectacle, as are the columns of tanks and battalions of costumed extras. The music by John Addison -- who had actually served in XXX Corps during Market Garden -- is at times uplifting, at other times ironic, and ultimately melancholy, all with variations on the same melody.<br/><br/>The destruction of Arnhem and the brutal fighting between the British paras and the German SS is shown in unflinching detail. Attenborough is less interested in the combat -- though there's plenty of it -- and more determined that we see the wounded soldiers who pile up after every battle. In one scene an officer has to step over the bodies of his men to get from one part of the house to the other; they crowd the hallways and staircases and cover the floor. In a later scene, he communicates with his radio operator through a hole that's been blown in the floor. The Hollywood style has always been to show the action and skip over the aftermath, making ""A Bridge Too Far"" startling in its realism. The last scene shows the Dutch civilians leaving the devastated town, a reminder that wars and battles don't simply end once the shooting stops."

"classicalsteve","4","9","15","6 June 2016"," A Movie Too Many Actors and Clichés--Sadly Not One of Attenborough's Better Efforts
","Quentin Tarantino once said it's best for characters in an action film to avoid discussing ""the plot"" too much. In ""A Bridge Too Far"", the dialogue and settings are so campy and obvious, the experience lapses into too many cliché scenes. Also, there are more stars in this film than in the Milky Way Galaxy. As the film moves along, name and star actors keep popping up: Sean Connery, Gene Hackman, Eliot Gould, Anthony Hopkins, James Caan, and Ryan O'Neil are all either donning officer's uniforms or privates' gear, and I've named only about half of them!<br/><br/>The story is certainly one worth exploring in a film: the failed military plan Operation Market Garden which occurred during early Fall of 1944 in which allied troops attempted to infiltrate Holland and push over bridges of the Rhine to enter into Germany as a means of more quickly ending the Second World War. It's not the actual story which is the problem; it's the realization which has much to be desired. Nearly every scene is filled with silly cliché drivel which has been used in war films from circa 1950 to 1965. It has much of the same issues as its predecessor ""The Longest Day"", in which high command, officers, and troops are constantly spewing over-the-top and/or unrealistic statements about the purpose of the endeavor.<br/><br/>Even without having viewed this film before, I predicted who would play which character. The following are those on the allied side. Gene Hackman obviously would be one of the lone voices to object to the mission, and he was cast as Stanisław Franciszek Sosabowski, a Polish General aiding the allies. Hackman's accent doesn't sound Polish but like bad Scottish as he rails against the allied leadership concerning the attack! Michael Caine as Colonel Joe Vandeleur pops up in a few scenes, often running around in a jeep wearing an ascot tie and sporting binoculars. I wasn't exactly certain where he fit into the operation. Eliot Gould as Col. Robert Stout is also often in a jeep, swearing with a cigar in his lips. He seems like a throw-back to his character in the original M.A.S.H. film (not the television show) where he played Capt. ""Trapper"" John McIntyre, who also sported a cigar. Ryan O'Neil plays Brig. Gen. James Gavin whose character in the film is so ambiguous I didn't understand that he was in fact a general who did go on para-trooping missions with lower-ranking enlisted men. Ryan seemed far too young in the role of a bona fide general.<br/><br/>The German side is little better. Hardy Krüger and Maximilian Schell lead among the German officers, but their dialogue and characterization ring of the issues in ""The Longest Day"". In other words, the Germans are portrayed as rather incompetent nincompoops who are constantly at attention like toy soldiers. One of the more silly exchanges is when one of the German high-command learn of the Allies para-trooping, they are dismayed they would be landing 12 km (about 7 miles) from the bridges over the Rhine. Duh. They're not going to land right on top of enemy lines, and the bridges are guarded by German infantry, which is shown later in the film. At one point, they also intercept allied plans from a wrecked Alley plane, but the high command immediately tosses them away, claiming they were placed there by the Allies as a means to fool the Germans. In point of fact, such plans were always brought to special intelligence departments for analysis by experts. In a similar story recounted in ""The Man Who Never Was"", the Germans received a planting of bogus plans aboard a wrecked airplane with dead ""pilot"", and they are eventually given to the Germans for intelligence analysis. That film was made 20 years before ""A Bridge Too Far"" and was far more realistic. <br/><br/>The incredible dialogue is what really makes this film. Consider the following with James Caan: Private: You tell me, Eddie. You tell me I won't die. Caan: All right, you won't die. Private: No, no. Guarantee me. I want you to guarantee me I won't die. Caan: I guarantee you. Soldiers in combat don't really talk like this. Most of the time if not all the time, they avoided talking about death. Here is an example from the German side: General Ludwig: Forgive me, but there is a battle. And we are in the process of winning it. Dr. Jan Spaander: Winning and losing is not our concern - living and dying... is. Do people really talk like this in the midst of war? I don't think so. <br/><br/>This film experience is like looking for Hitchcock in a Hitchcock film: everywhere different name actors pop up and you find yourself wanting to find the next one which is shown on the poster with little boxes for all the movie stars! The problem is there are just way too many roles for name actors, and I was getting confused as to where I was or which character was doing which task. It would been far better to focus on fewer characters and develop them well instead of relying on every war cliché imaginable and hoping it sticks like spaghetti thrown against the wall. Sometimes it sticks, but more often it doesn't."

Definitely unfocused, but Attenborough pulls it off with considerable historical accuracy and his signature deft touch retelling of this sprawling military debacle. He makes excellent use of his tremendous cast, instead of just having them making appearances.

"rick-520-6264","10","8","14","9 January 2015"," An unmatched epic
","Since I first saw it over thirty years ago, A Bridge Too Far remains one my favourite films of all time. In addition to the all-star cast that provides the right amount of weight to the characters, the fact that director Richard Attenborough was able to put together the vast and well-choreographed combat scenes with such accuracy remains excellent viewing today as it was back when the film was made. Back in 1977, there were no special CGI effects to plug the obvious gaps, and thousands of extras were used.<br/><br/>Covering the planned attack on the German western flank with the aim of securing a path into the German industrial heartland, Operation Market Garden was a massive undertaking, conceived by British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery in short period of time. Central to the mission would be the landing of over 35,000 airborne troops from Britain, the United States and Poland.<br/><br/>The story flows nicely, and while I am a history buff and know all of the characters, my girlfriend who finally watched the film with me after years of having me bang on about it was able to follow it easily. I guessed it helps that she has become familiar with Waffen-SS formations and loves US jeeps! From what I have seen and heard over the years, most if not all of the main roles were excellently written. Sean Connery is excellent as Maj. Gen. ""Roy"" Urquhart and Anthony Hopkins plays Lt. Col. John Frost with an aristocratic authority, but the star of the show is the excellent Edward Fox as Lt. Gen. Brian Horrocks - especially for his rousing speech prior to XXX Corps setting off on the narrow road to Arnhem.<br/><br/>Every aspect is touched nicely, from the impact on the soldiers from all sides as the battle progressed, through to the ordinary Dutch civilians from the underground father and son team through to Kate ter Horst (Liv Ullmann) and Dr. Spaander (Laurence Olivier).<br/><br/>However what really stands out for me is the scriptwriter's treatment of the Germans, right at a time when feelings about the Second World War were still raw for many (including Dirk Bogarde, who once said that he would exit a lift if a German walked in). They are treated with an accuracy and sensitivity, more so as the two main divisions featured in the film are Waffen-SS - for long seen as the baddest of the ""bad guys"". Unlike other films of that time such as ""The Battle of the Bulge"", ""Where Eagles Dare"" and the like, none of the German officers are ""ve haff vays of mekking you talk"" cardboard cutouts - probably helped by their speaking German rather than English in a silly accent.<br/><br/>Hardy Krüger's SS-Brigadeführer Ludwig (a character based on SS-Brigadeführer Heinz Harmel, commander of the 10th SS Panzer Division ""Frundsberg"") is rightly portrayed as a hard but fair officer, and his immediate superior SS-Obergruppenführer Willi Bittrich is truthfully shown as a consummate professional soldier - battle-hardened yet not beyond showing compassion for his enemy. Both ""Frundsberg"" and the 9th SS Panzerdivision ""Hohenstaufen"" (comprising the II. Panzerkorps) were widely respected by their former enemies, and truly lived up to their reputation as an elite military formation.<br/><br/>There are some slight quibbles - rollbars on Kubelwagens, the composite grey Panther tanks, the senior Waffen-SS officers' collar patches being of an older variant, the use of the Wehrmacht term ""general"" as opposed to proper SS ranks - but these are really the domain of the military geek like myself who has watched the film well over a couple of hundred times.<br/><br/>One sad side story concerns the commander of the ""Hohenstaufen"" 9th Reconnaissance Battalion, SS-Hauptsturmführer Viktor-Eberhard Gräbner (mistakenly called ""Paul Grabner"" in the cast list). He had been awarded the Knight's Cross earlier in the summer, but he wouldn't actually get to wear the award until September 17th - the day before he died on Arnhem bridge.<br/><br/>Operation Market Garden carried a heavy cost for the Allies, but despite the huge losses and Germans coming out on top it did probably shorten the war - though not by Christmas of 1944 as Montgomery had envisaged. It remains in itself a disaster, but ultimately a heroic one.<br/><br/>In all, A Bridge Too Far strikes the right tone and balance, and tells the story as it is wile allowing us to get to know the personalities involved. It still stands high today, and remains in many ways an unmatched classic."

","We have here a typical case of patriotic war film with more stars than your average Christmas tree, with the usual convention that the bigger the star the more heroic they are.  However, there is a problem: the historical incident depicted here was a military failure, from an allied point of view.<br/><br/>And this problem is a big problem.  There is nothing wrong with telling the story of a failed military action, but it just does not work if you tell it in the ""just look what great chaps we have fighting for us"" subgenre of war film.<br/><br/>An added problem this subgenre continually suffers from is the Towering Inferno syndrome: the big stars will survive/succeed and we know it.  When Ryan O'Neal enlists Robert Redford for a suicide mission we just know that this means the death of most of his soldiers but our star will come through unscathed."

","If you don't want to read about Operation Market Garden watch this film.This movie is an extremely accurate historical account of the mission. The casting is perfect. I can think of no one better to play each part than the cast that was chosen. Each scene is brilliantly acted. The only negative element that I noticed was that General Model was portrayed more cowardly and ignorant than he actually was.The film starts off in Germany with the staff welcoming back General Gerd Von Runstedt to command in Holland. Previous to his return (not shown in the movie)General Von Runstedt was removed from command when he could offer no other advice to Berlin other than ""surrender"". Obviously Hitler and the High Command did not like this attitude and he was replaced by General Von Kluge. It is believed that Von Kluge had been involved in the assassination attempt on Hitler in July and in about 44 days he was summoned to Berlin. He committed suicide on the way. Again, another new commander was appointed. This time it was Field Marshal Walter Model. Model had the same orders as Von Kluge. In September 1944. he set up as best he could, the German line defense south of the Netherlands' main rivers. With all that territory, there were too few men to stand any chance against the Allies. Many times Model asked Berlin to send help. But Germany didn't have any reinforcements to send. There were shortages in the East and everywhere else.Thus they they pressed wounded, young and old men,and even boys into service. They were all sent to the Netherlands with police, cooks, clerks, recovering soldiers and anyone else to prevent the Allied advance at all costs. Now Model's line stretched from Antwerp (southwest Holland) to Maastricht (south Holland). The 15th Army was ordered to prepare for an assault on Antwerp. He thought maybe there would be a chance to isolate the British troops. Model also ordered the 2nd SS Panzer Corps to retreat towards Arnhem. Again, the High Command was less than satisfied and Model was replaced by Von Runstedt. Even though Model had brought this corps to Arnhem to rest and refit, his decision is one of the reasons, if not the reason, why Operation Market Garden failed.So lets give Model some credit! Other than that, there is nothing I can say that hasn't already been said. The Bridge Too Far is one of the best war films ever and should be part of every History and or War Buff's collection."

The German army was on the run. Enter Field Marshal Montgomery's folly. Operation Market-Garden: an army, 35,000 Allied airborne, with vehicles and artillery, dropped in the Dutch countryside still occupied by Germans. Goal: take five bridges and the road connecting them so Montgomery's Second Army would triumphantly reach the last bridge at Arnhem, thence into Germany. All the bridges but Arnhem Bridge were taken.<br/><br/>If only everything had gone strictly by schedule, it would have worked, but 75% of Montgomery's plan was left to chance. For example. Supply drops and reinforcements delayed by weather. Break-down in radio communication. German panzer divisions resting in Arnhem because it was ""a peaceful sector where nothing was happening"" -- a deadly coincidence, that. And so on. A week later, Operation Market-Garden became a withdrawal, after the Allies lost 17,000 troops.<br/><br/>A bit of trivia not mentioned (as of this moment) in the IMDb trivia page for this flick? This was a pivotal film for Sean Connery's agent. Other major movie stars signed on to be in the movie -- at respectable movie star salaries -- only after hearing that Connery had been signed for the film, and that they would be in a film with Sean Connery (so cool for them).

"Red-Barracuda","8","4","6","28 November 2015"," One of the all-time great downer war movies
","A Bridge Too Far is a war film obviously a product of 70's cinema, in that it takes a decidedly uncelebratory route in telling its story. The very fact that it focuses on a famous Allied military disaster is an immediate pointer. Set during the final stages of World War II in 1944, it finds the Allied command in over-confident mood on account of their recent advances on D-Day. The top brass devise a knock-out punch where troops will pierce through Holland from the air and from the ground, taking advantage of low demoralised German numbers. The key being the taking of several bridges, culminating with a crucial one in Arnhem. The problem is that some early warning signs are ignored, which report a much heavier German presence in the area, the operation is given the go ahead regardless only to discover that area is swarming with crack SS troops.<br/><br/>Directed by Richard Attenborough, this is an example of a type of film that they simply cannot afford to make any more on account of its ludicrously high calibre ensemble cast. We have Sean Connery, Ryan O'Neal, Anthony Hopkins, Edward Fox, Michael Caine, Dirk Bogarde, Laurence Olivier, Robert Redford, Gene Hackman, Maximilian Schell, Liv Ullman, James Caan and Elliott Gould. It's an unbelievable set of actors to have at its disposal and the film does, for the most part, make good use of them. Not only this but it's visually a treat with beautiful photography and great on-location sets, particularly in Arnhem. The battle scenes were well recreated and it did overall give the feeling of a commendably balanced portrayal of events. This extends to the way that the Germans are depicted, where we have SS men shown in ways that didn't have them as utterly sadistic and evil as is usually the way. This overall measured approach is one that serves this material well in that this is pretty far from jingoistic stuff. It's a pretty doom-laden film in actual fact but I like the fact that it is unafraid to pull its punches and be like this. For this very reason, coupled with the great production values and direction, this remains one of the all-time great war movies for me."

"azanti0029","10","4","6","14 October 2012"," Probably the last great war epic of its type to be made, and the best of the bunch...
","Now before I am accused of false praise I want to make it clear how I review a film. In my own head the primary purpose of a film is to succeed on its own level, to accomplish its own objective. So does this sweeping film with a plethora of stars in an ensemble piece achieve in telling the fateful story of one of the most daring operations of World War II, and the events in Holland of 1944 - Yes it does, on almost every level.<br/><br/>This is not Saving Private Ryan, a story of war told through the eyes of one man and his unit, this is the story of a whole operation seen from the perspective of many different individuals on different sides but it does have the realism and grit of that movie and the grandeur of scale that movies these days can rarely emulate. Only a few other films have been made that can compete with this, the excellent but rather sanitised The Longest Day, and the epic but horribly misrepresented and historically inaccurate Battle Of The Bulge.<br/><br/>A Bridge Too Far is basically the story of Allied over confidence gone wrong. The plan was to end the war by Christmas with the intention of capturing a series of bridges with three Airbourne Divisions and one brigade, the last bridge of which sat over the upper Rhine and would give the good guys a back door into Germany. Seemingly defeated, everything looked promising for the operation, but things of course in battle rarely go according to plan.<br/><br/>Richard Attenborough packs tremendous detail here into every shot of the film and the special effects still hold up well today. No CGI for the parachute scenes here, they had to drop 800 extras for real on this movie. And the film has several tremendous set pieces to recommend it, from the crossing of the river Waal by the 82nd Airbourne to Grabners SS recon platoon charge over Arnhem bridge against dug in British Paratroopers.<br/><br/>Close to three hours in running time the film never the less moves at a cracking pace and is rarely if ever boring. Liv Ulman plays with great care the woman Kate Ter Host, who was instrumental in providing medical care for the besieged British forces at Osterbeek (A woman who deserves a movie about her life, and will get one if I have anything to do with it) and the ensemble cast from Sean Connery, Lawrence Olivier, Dirk Bogarde to Robert Redford all act with appropriate levels of pomp and bravado as is befitting to their various roles. Acting geeks might wish to spot a whole host of talent in supporting and minor roles from Alun Armstrong and Ben Cross along with the excellent Paul Copley, all doing a fine job of filling in those small but crucial scenes. Michael Caine and Edward Fox both do fine jobs as the commanders of the British armoured cavalry leading the way.<br/><br/>A Bridge Too Far works because its well written, well acted, well directed and above all it is truthful. Some characters have been amalgamated here and there to consolidate facts and people for time, but there has been no alternation of events. This is a film not to be missed, even if you do not have an interest in military history its unlikely that you won't be moved by the calamity of the events that unravel in this story of why war sucks and how the best intentions of a few people led to the needless deaths of many.<br/><br/>This is Attenborough at his finest hour and this film is often criminally overlooked or under stated in biographies and analysis of his work, which as one of the finest epic war films of all time, it should never be. Critics should take note and add it into their lists of one of finest movies of its type ever made. It is unlikely we will ever see its type again, more so the pity."

","A huge international cast stars in ""A Bridge Too Far,"" a world war II film based on the Cornelius Ryan novel.

General 'Boy' Browning (Dirk Bogarde) who supposedly said something like, ""I always said we were going a bridge too far."" The film tells the story of operation Market Garden, an attempt by the allies to end the war by securing three bridges in Holland that allowed access over the Rhine into Germany.<br/><br/>Unfortunately it was a complete disaster.<br/><br/>There were too many contingencies not planned for by the Allies, plus the German presence was much stronger than expected. And the Germans got stronger since they were getting the Allies' supplies - when the parameters changed, no one told the planes, and all the signaling in the world didn't help because the pilots were trained not to pay any attention to ground signals. So the divisions were running out of food and ammunition. Some of them couldn't actually get to the bridges -- all kinds of problems.<br/><br/>The scapegoat for all of this in the film is Lt. General Browning for several reasons. One - the characters of Patton, Montgomery and Eisenhower were not featured in the film; the funds for the movie came from the U.S. and Browning, being British, seemed a good bet; and lastly, Browning was dead and couldn't complain.<br/><br/>Alas, Browning was well known. He not only served in WW II but worked for Queen Elizabeth, and on top of that, he was married to Daphne du Maurier. She and Browning's children were offended by his portrayal in the film as a cold-hearted general who ignored good Dutch surveillance. His portrayal was the subject of editorials in the British papers and letters to the editor from Richard Attenborough, the director.<br/><br/>Dirk Bogarde didn't take kindly to the portrayal he was directed to give by the script and director either and felt completely betrayed by Attenborough, his director and next door neighbor, causing a rift between them that was never completely fixed.<br/><br/>In truth, indeed, Browning reported to Montgomery who wanted a big success in Holland and he did ignore good information about panzer divisions in Holland; in fact, the soldier who complained that the surveillance was being ignored was put on sick leave.<br/><br/>This all sounds like it was an enormous part of the film, but it wasn't. At the time, though, I think a prejudice against Bogarde being gay also played into the complaints.<br/><br/>The film is filled with huge battles and has some very exciting and poignant sequences. Though there are so many divisions and commanders, it's directed well so that it's not hard to follow.<br/><br/>A slice of World War II that reminds us again of the terrible loss of civilian and military life and mass destruction. Not a bad idea for memorial day."

","This was an enormous adaptation by director Richard Attenborough 0f Cornelius Ryan's novel and it features one the largest all-star casts in cinematic history. The film explains the rendering of a daring, but ultimately disastrous, raid behind enemy lines in Holland during the Second World War, what became known as 'Operation Market Garden'. In an effort to end the war sooner, the Allied High Command plans an attack that will drop thousands of paratroopers behind enemy lines and then send the armour (XXX CORPS) in to meet up with them and secure several strategic bridges.<br/><br/>The film boasts an excellent cast full of big name stars such as Dirk Bogarde, James Caan, Michael Caine, Sean Connery, Edward Fox, Elliott Gould, Gene Hackman, Anthony Hopkins, Hardy Kruger, Laurence Olivier, Ryan O'Neal, Robert Redford, Maximilian Schell and Liv Ullmann – just the top line. It secured good reviews at the time and was a modest success at the box office (competing with Star Wars!!). Lord Attenborough however can still look back and know that it was a worthwhile project despite the lack of obvious peer accolades. The film has been criticised by reviewers because has so many stars and, despite runtime, limited character development. I'm sorry but I just can't agree. I found myself easily getting attached to Connery, Caine, Hackman and Hopkins characters. <br/><br/>All the players do a brilliant job – for a film packed with big name stars it has to be said there were no – 'look at me I'm the best' performances – perhaps because they were dealing with such as serious subject. Yet comedy still plays a large part, mostly British 'stiff upper lip stuff' that non brits will not readily identify with. Examples would be Connery's response when asked if he wants a cup of tea or Hopkins batman wondering why he'll need a dinner jacket.<br/><br/>Edward Fox gets a lovely opportunity to show why he's such a good actor with a great speech to his officers (that really occurred). Redford leads a boat crossing reminiscent the charge of the light bridge (but a little more successful) and Connery steals every shot he's in, making you really believe he is Major General Urquhart. Lord Olivier plays a Dutch doctor (well he also has a Danish Knighthood) extremely well and with great sensitivity.<br/><br/>I have to say that it is small details that makes the movie for me, the blood dripping onto the blood beside the child, the brave paratrooper recovering the canister and Liv Ullmann reading to the dying soldier. Beautifully shot with reasonable pace and the increasing sense that this one may unravel means that, at least for this writer, the 3 hours flies by. The sense of hopelessness is nicely described by one of Connery adjutants when he states 'it's hard to stop tanks with rifles and machine guns' after they learnt they've landed on top of two SS Panzer divisions.<br/><br/>There is also a great deal of humour in the movie (most of it slightly off kilter and terribly British). The contrast between Caine and Goulds character, Major Wells with his umbrella, Sean Connerys comment about God being a Scotsman. There are lovely and tragic moments scattered throughout the film which give careful insight into the humour sometimes discovered in combat situations. <br/><br/>A finally note should be made of Attenborough's attention to historical detail. From the weapons they use such as the Piat against the tanks, to the type of house to house street fighting, Major Gen Urquhart getting cut off and the Germans finding the allied plans. Seldom have I know a film that claims to follow a true story that has such rigorous attention to historical events. In order to achieve this they pulled in lots of military and technical advisor's (if you've watched the film you may know some of these names): Frost, Gavin, Gregg, Horrocks, Morgan, Ryan, Urquhart, Vandeleur, Van Eijk.<br/><br/>There is a lovely vignette that during the shooting of Hopkins run between buildings Johnny Frost who retired as a Major General said at one point:<br/><br/>'No no dear boy I don't run like that'<br/><br/>They re-shot the scene twice with Hopkins being covered each time up debris from the explosions. Eventually they kept the original take as the most believable! John Addison's music score will have you humming along for a number of days and the CD is well worth buying. Oh and the Special Edition DVD is out."

The cats is all star-studded and shines all the film throughout, with all the best cast in small, but significant roles - Dirk Bogarde James Caan Michael Caine Sean Connery Edward Fox Anthony Hopkins Gene Hackman Hardy Krüger Laurence Olivier Robert Redford Maximilian Schell - among many. The film leaves no open ending, with a message that is clear and clean - war is terrible, and there are no good deaths. A Bridge is shot very much in The Longest Day or A Battle Of Britain style, where all the actors speak their languages, and the subtitles are of great help. The 3 hours of the length may seem a bit too long for some, but for war film fans this work flies like a lightning and gives almost not a second to breathe. Very tense tempo helps and adds much to the splendid work of cinematography. Highly recommended"

","After reading some of the other user comments i'd just like to say a few words to the Americans who were Brit bashing.<br/><br/>Firstly, if you're going to impart your wisdom upon us - LEARN SOMETHING ABOUT THE WAR BEFORE YOU DO. Surprise, Surprise, the war actually began in 1939 (Micheal Caine who stars in this film, famously withdrew his children from American school after they had been taught that the Second World War began in 1941!) By the time of the Market Garden Operation, Montgomery was a Field Marshall, not a General - he had been promoted. The year 1942 was the turning point of World War 2, It was the year the German army suffered it's first major land defeats and reverses - at Stalingrad and at El Alemien. The war had been won - mostly thanks to the Russians who suffered the most atrocious losses imaginable on the forgotten Eastern Front. The turning point of the war had come before the American forces had barely crossed the Atlantic. Montgomery was the hero of El Alemien and a master of the classic pitched battle. Patton, while an expert in mobile warfare proved to be totally inept when it came to assaulting fortified positions such as those around Metz - where he just sent wave after wave of tanks to be shot to pieces by German artillery, because that was the only tactic he knew.<br/><br/>
The trouble was that when Montgomery devised 'Market Garden' he was attempting a Patton like manouver, it is true that both men despised each other and each wanted to be the first to Berlin - in fact had Eisenhower listened to Montgomery and pushed on to Berlin at the end of the war, the entire face of post-war Europe would have been different. 'Market Garden' would probably have worked, had it not been for the unlikely misfortune that an SS Panzer division just happened to be stationed in Arnhem for repairs for a few days.<br/><br/>It is disappointing that the director, Attenbourgh - an Englishman himself, at times resorted to the tired and false Hollywood cliche of the British as being inept and over-cautious, 8000 of our boys died at Arnhem.<br/><br/>
Perhaps now you are beginning to realize that your sheer ignorance is why you are so disliked in the world?"

This film clearly showed what it was like fighting the Germans and how at times each side had compassion for the others in treating and caring for their wounded, nothing like the fight with the JAPS.

","Some of the naff comments posted here make me wonder if people were watching the same movie, or what they were smoking or drinking when they did. Warts and all, this movie rewards repeated viewing. I just watched it again only to check on the presence of a certain military vehicle, which appears near the beginning (long story), and I ended up watching the whole thing again - and then reviewing certain scenes and shots. What I really appreciated this time around were classic cinematic techniques of visual storytelling, many of them noted in other comments. And it is without question, one of the best war movies made. Yes, it suffers dramatically because it stays close to the facts. Yes, it is confusing, and reading up on the story of Op Market Garden can help ease the confusion - but it is true to the larger facts and issues. On the cast: most of the Americans they got wrong - I have never, ever understood Ryan O'Neil's presence in the movies. Redford was Redford, same as he is in every picture. Gould - feh. Hackman, great actor, but wrong here. Caan I actually thought was fine (his Capt. Glass was actually a Canadian actor, Nicholas Campbell, latterly best known as coroner Dominic DaVinci on DaVinci's Inquest). <br/><br/>Most of the British they got right, some note-perfect others were OK, albeit some in a rather clichéd way, but better than most of the Yanks. And for the guy who said that John (Cliff Claven) Ratzenberger was uncredited as an American officer, well, he is credited. And for the guy who was commenting on the PIAT - the correct term is Projector, Infantry, Antitank - and while a seemingly odd weapon, what with the spring and spigot arrangement, when used as designed it could be quite effective. A Canadian called Smokey Smith was awarded the VC for using it quite lethally against German panzers in Italy. True, the panzerfaust and bazooka and their descendants (like the RPG-7) are more powerful and effective, but the PIAT had its day. Details of weapons and equipment were as good as it gets, given the limitations of movie making - no obvious clangers among the vehicles (OK, rollbars on Kubelwagens,and a lot of fudged German kit) - I'm sure there are purist quibbles. Sure nice to see the Bren carriers among the Shermans, Jeeps, M3 halftracks, QLs, etc., and the scout cars, Caine's Humber and the Dingo are spiffy. Those fighter bombers, yeh, they sure weren't Typhoons, so I guess we were supposed to pretend those Harvards were P-47s - they made me think more of Brewsters or pre-war Severskys. <br/><br/>The Auster was a nice touch (I grew up with RCAF DC-3s overhead all the time, so they weren't such big novelty to see - I miss them now. There was one at the airport recently - I heard its engines and knew right away what it was.) And yeh, it would been nice to see more of the Horsa gliders - especially since they were done so well (with models) in The Longest Day - but a little matte work is a much as Attenborough was going for in fudging the aviation stuff. Oh, and I like Addison's score, too, bombast and all."

","They don't make them like this anymore - thank goodness! If I were asked to sum up this film in one word, cringeworthy would suffice. This particular episode in WWII may well warrant a film, but they could have done better with a tenth of the number of 'stars' and a four-times better script. For pity's sake, every one of the sprawling individual little scenarios consisted of the kind of hackneyed stereotypes which began to be outdated in the 1950s and early 1960s. One could forgive the 'knocking the Hun for six' jingoism in 'The Dam Busters' as the wartime Pathe newsreel propaganda had not fully died down when that film was made, but 'A Bridge Too Far' was made in 1977 and Levine and Attenborough had no excuses for such twaddle. I'm not sure whether it was the American officer chewing on his cigar, or the British officer with his umbrella, or the 'rebel without a cause' always played by James Caan, or the immortal superhuman James Bond in uniform always played by Sean Connery, which annoyed me the most. Or, perhaps it was the limiting and wooden script given to Dirk Bogarde, who, along with Olivier, were wasted in cameo roles. The final damning indictment on the film was completed by the Pathe newsreel type music and the nauseatingly predictable and stereotypical background speech and shouted comments of the soldiers 'all doing their bit'."

","Richard Attenborough again directs an all-star cast about operation Market Garden. The Allies attempt to parachute behind enemy lines, secure bridges, and meet up with ground support to sneak into the Ruhr Valley in Germany during the Fall of 1944. The film is based on Cornelius Ryan's book of the same name. The details of the film are mostly authentic, right down to the equipment and artillery used in battle scenes. The film does a good job of setting up the unlikely premise of the Allies parachuting thousands of men behind enemy lines in order to target the industrial area in Germany. However, there are far too many leaders, characters, and scenarios to follow to build an impact and make sense of the film.<br/><br/>There is no protagonist in the film; therefore it's hard to identify with any one situation or event. Instead, the actors are featured in what turns out to be a string of cameo scenarios, which are connected by mostly off-screen plot-lines. Individual scenes stand out like James Caan eluding Germans and forcing Arthur Hill to operate at gunpoint, Sean Connery getting holed up in an attic to avoid capture, and the tedious back and forth battle between British and German forces for a bridge. Attenborough seems more concerned with getting specific details about the operation correct than in making a film about a failed operation. However, unless one is a student of this particular operation, it is difficult to understand the interconnectedness of each battle and its purpose and or effect on the operation. The battle scenes are realistic, and the soundtrack is first rate, but ultimately, as with many all-star cast war movies, the film is weighed down by its huge budget, lack of a protagonist, and lack of character and plot development. **1/2 of 4 stars."

","Watched it recently on video after a gap of at least 10 years and remains one of my favourite war movies, with a star-studded cast, stirring musical score and enthralling, yet tragic, storyline. Only downside is it's complexity. Read Ryan's books and you'll find out more about this critical Allied defeat in WWII. It covers facts vital to the result of the mission that the film left out, such as the Allies' failure to capture the Belgian channel ports that would have eased Market Garden's re-supply problem and the critical mistake of not dropping the paras at Arnhem in one full drop, resulting in the loss of surprise. The book also clarifies the casting of Ryan O'Neal. General Gavin, who he portrayed, was in his late 30s at Arnhem - so Attenbrough was spot with O'Neal. I also felt General Browning, played by Bogarde, was unfairly depicted as the villain. After all, he warned Montgomery, his immediate superior, that going for Arnhem Bridge was a 'Bridge too far'."

The score is top-notch and research quite good. C47s were painted the wrong color, but apparently that was a director's decision....but name me any other movies where you see a PIAT anti-tank gun in action. As an aside, despite what some armchair historians may think, Ryan O'Neil was actually older than General John Gavin (the person he portrays) was at Arnhem.

The generals are depicted as inept and cowardly, the Allied armies disorganized for the most part.  <br/><br/>It does reach back to the gung-ho war pictures of the John Wayne era in an attempt to pump some bravado into the action, but the dialogue is so ludicrous and the characters so transparent that it all falls flat.  The scenes with Anthony Hopkins are painful to watch, and can anyone believe Robert Redford as an Army major who says ""please"" when rallying his troops?<br/><br/>William Goldman has written some excellent scripts, but this one was just terrible.

I do agree with one of the negative reviewers that, while I think he was a tad harsh his overall rating of 1 (IIRC), the scene where James Caan rescues his buddy by driving an open jeep through dozens of alert Germans is rather extremely unbelievable and thereby unintentionally hilarious. The poster claims he counted shots and that the Germans were something like zero for 367 in taking shots at Caan's jeep, with many of them at point-blank range. He's probably not far off with that count! This is worse than some of the scenes in Star Wars where the bad guys are unable to hit Luke & Co. with LASER weapons at equally close ranges. At least Caan was in motion but still, it's ridiculous.

The majority of the people you have written comments on this film believe this not to be the case.  I have studied military history and even serve within in it.  There has never been and never will be a military operation that will achieve all its aims by the means first thought of.  John Keegan wrote that 'No plan survives first contact with the enemy'.  And, therefore, by their reasoning no military operation is successful.  Mistakes happen and people don't always come through.  The sad and cruel reality of war is people die and most of the time pointlessly.  I don't like it but it is true.<br/><br/>The film was designed to highlight the actions and achievements of the individuals involved.  The men on the ground held out longer than anyone could have expected and against greater odds.  The film should be viewed as a memorial to those that were willing to fight for something better irrespective of whether the last bridge was secured.<br/><br/>Either way this is a film worth watching at least once just so you can understand what your freedom cost."

Aside from those and the music, a fine fine film.<br/><br/>It's a faithful version of Cornelius Ryan's epic account of Operation Market-Garden and the Battle of Arnhem, directed with gusto and honesty by Richard Attenborough, whom I believe is a veteran of the battle. The casting is brilliant, except maybe for Ryan O'Neal, who plays the boyish Jim Gavin, well, *too* boyishly. (O'Neal was 37 during filming, and Gavin was the same age during the battle, but Gavin had two years of battle-hardening under his belt -- his boyishness was relative to older soldiers, not to Hollywood stars!) And aside from the clunky retro German tanks, and the over-obvious use of roll bars on the Kubelwagens, the machinery assembled has rarely been exceeded. Look at all those Shermans! See the beautiful C-47s! (Even though it's fairly obvious not that many of them were airworthy, after repeated viewings.)

","A Bridge too Far is an epic war film about the failed Opperation Marketgarden in World War Two where the allies hoped to have a quick push through the Netherlands and into the Ruhr region of Germany, her industrial heartland. This film takes a look at the operation from a number of points of view, from the Dutch Resistance, the British high command, British and American ground troops and the German commanders in Holland. This film takes a look at mistakes made by commanders of the operation and how the mission was a failure despite the best efforts of the ground troops. This film avoids the cliché of making all Germans and Nazis as evil characters which was possibilities a more truthful portrayal. There was no mention of the SS or things such as the Holocrast. The film is also well directed by Richard Attenborough who is good at casting and the battle scenes were good. I wouldn't be surprised if this film helped influence Saving Private Ryan. A Bridge Too Far is a bold attempt of making a film, it was long, nearly 3 hours, but I think that it was needed and it couldn't have been shorter then 2 hours 30 minutes. The film also ends in a bittersweet note, and that was properly why this film was that successful at the box-office because people at the time didn't want to see a film about a military failure. The only think I didn't like about the film was the fact that Americans were shown to be be very noble and wanted to help out other soldiers regardless about anything else whilst the British were too prudent and did not want to go against there orders. In real life it would have been more of a mix in both armies. However A Bridge Too Far is a good film and is well worth watching, especially if you like war films or interested in WWII."

","Many of the World War II films contemporary to the War are finely acted, or full of carefree sing-and-dance numbers. Un-bitter pieces with clear conflicts and villains. <br/><br/>This film is released in 1977...the same year Star Wars came out - and allows for a different mood. Having sufficient distance from the World War, with two other American conflicts in between, a more ambiguous view of both the Allies and the Axis powers emerges. Not that the Nazis are suddenly good guys, but they have their problems too.<br/><br/>The plot is influenced by the point of view of all of those having to take orders from above and follow those orders to their best ability. Even when they know failure is more likely than not, even though ""what was supposed to happen"" didn't happen and now they have to improvise, not only to save themselves, but to save the other guys that are counting on them.<br/><br/>To my eye, this film combines old-school film-making, real craftsmanship in both scale and detail, while navigating the plot's tightrope of tough decisions and lucky breaks. Beautifully illustrated for both the Good Guys and the Bad Guys is the notion that the men in the field suffer when commanders have lost situational awareness. A degree of satisfaction may be removed for some viewers due to the absence of a clear hero,winner, or lesson learned. <br/><br/>All-star casts don't always ""work"" but this one does and I would argue it contends with The Great Escape just on that particular point. Jamming all those jewels into one setting sometimes makes for gaudiness, more than elegance. Not so for either film!

Apology?<br/><br/>Quite apart from the historical significance of the event (and the significance of the film of the event), this is rather worth watching. It isn't because of the story, which is muddled and drifts off into ratholes like the operation. (Remember how clear everything was in `Seven Samurai')? It isn't because of the acting, which in general is British `tea-pot' acting. That is except for Anthony Hopkins.

What makes this special is the camera. The shots of the airdrop from that first flash of beige planes until Sean Connery takes charge is brilliant filmmaking. The focus on tank treads, on glider towropes unfurling; the POV shots of dropping soldiers, the rise of the attacking tanks over the bridge. Although one loses the narrative thread of what's happening where spatially, the viewer certainly gets a feel for the machinery so it makes sense when Connery's group is stuck without it. The bridgemaking sequence flows like the water under it and seems to have the same inevitable inertia.<br/><br/>Now think about this: no helicopter shots. no slowmotion. no CGI, no compositing, no filters -- just the vision of one man and a simple camera in the moment of happening. (just like Connery's bunch with their shoes and rifles and little else while all the technology is set apart, waiting. Every framing trick Speilberg pulled in `Private Ryan,' you can see here except the underwater shots. And better, less cluttered with the need to thrill. Unsworth, the cinematographer, apparently learned from Kubrick because he was as transformed by `2001' as the characters of that play.<br/><br/>Some of this vision was appropriated by Malick in his epic war poem `Red Line.'<br/><br/>Ted's evaluation: 3 of 4 -- Worth watching."

","This is one of my all-time favourite war epics. Its not just a movie it deserves the title 'Epic'.<br/><br/>An all star cast that works very well together. Excellent production values. Where the heck did they get ALL that equipment from? Extraordinary. A script that never flags, is always consistent, relevant, to the point and yet very humorous where it matters. It bears repeated watching. I'd place it alongside classics like 'The Longest Day', without any problem. There are probably historical inaccuracies to do with chronologies or issues not mentioned below, but I'm not bothered by them. If I wanted abs. historical accuracy I'd watch a documentary, not a movie.<br/><br/>I don't know if the following will be regarded as a spoiler so I'll put a warning just in case: There is to my mind only one problem with it, and this is no fault of the producers or the technical staff. It can't help being made in 1977. Unfortunately being filmed for the most part in urban settings, all those settings (architecture, clothing/hairstyles etc.) are contemporary to 1977, not to 1944. I've only just noticed it watching it now. It reminds of a similar problem with Anzio the movie with Robert Michum about the landings in Italy. The end scene of that film was entirely 1960s/70s. Spoilt the effect. But with 'A Bridge...', what could they do? It would have made an already vastly expensive undertaking costly beyond anyone's resources to have got everyone, all the Dutch civilians, to be kitted out in 1944 styles. And to build original looking sets for all the scenes. The expense would have been impossibly outrageous (before CG might have done the job). 1977 was probably the last time they could make an epic of WW2 with equipment available as originals or mock-ups. So, with that caveat, I give it a 9. It really deserves 10, but I think 9 says it all anyhow."

","In the opening hour of Richard Attenborough's monumental Second World War epic, Major General Robert Urquhart, played by Sean Connery, is greeted upon parachuting into Holland by lunatics who have escaped from a nearby asylum. This image sums up perfectly the tragicomic circumstances of Operation Market Garden, an Allied offensive in 1944 that led to some 30,000 casualties between the two sides.<br/><br/>'A Bridge Too Far' is the last in cinema's tradition of grand battle epics, marked by such blockbusters as 'The Guns of Navarone,' 'The Longest Day,' and 'Patton.' All of these titles sported major casts, large-scale action, and outstanding production values. While Spielberg's 'Saving Private Ryan' has paved new roads for the genre, 'A Bridge Too Far' marks the end of a special time in Hollywood when vast arrays of talent came together for a single project. It seems unlikely that another such film will appear in the near future with production costs skyrocketing, so it's quite appropriate that 'A Bridge Too Far' has something of a last word on the Second World War's bloodshed.<br/><br/>Adapted by screenwriter William Goldman from Cornelius Ryan's popular book, 'A Bridge Too Far' steers us through the hasty planning, poor execution, and horrific aftermath of Market Garden, a high-stakes offensive for ending the war in Europe by Christmas 1944. The plan, 'credited' to Bernard Montgomery, involved dropping 35,000 Allied soldiers into Holland to secure key bridges, funnel trailing armies into Germany, and capture Berlin. In other words, Market Garden - the largest aerial operation in world history - was a parachute version of D-Day.<br/><br/>Montgomery's plan was first revealed by Lieutenant General Frederick Browning, depicted as a snooty figure by Dirk Bogarde. Several generals received the plan with enthusiasm, such as Lieutenant General Brian Horrocks (Edward Fox) of British 30 Corps and U. S. Major General Maxwell Taylor (Paul Maxwell). Others, however, looked upon it with reservations: Robert Urquhart, Brigadier General James Gavin (Ryan O'Neal), and Major General Stanislaw Sosabowski (Gene Hackman) were amongst those who found the risks too great. Yet Allied leadership, seeking an end to the war, cooperated. Warnings from Dutch intelligence on the presence of German tank divisions were ignored and the Allied generals quickly discovered their mistake.<br/><br/>Most of the film's running time is comprised of Allied efforts to secure the Dutch bridges, with leading Hollywood and European actors making appearances. Included are Michael Caine, James Caan, Elliott Gould, Anthony Hopkins, Laurence Olivier, Liv Ullmann, and Hardy Krüger. Because of space limits, a great deal of talent must be left out here. Filmed at original battle sites, 'A Bridge Too Far' is packed with tanks, jeeps, airplanes, and heavy artillery. Hundreds of extras, including paratroopers, fill expansive action scenes made years before the digital magic of CGI. <br/><br/>While sympathetic to men in combat, 'A Bridge Too Far' portrays the Allies as bringing a great deal of failure upon themselves. Besides paratroopers fighting with rifles against German tanks, we hear of crystal radios that don't work, watch supply drops that always miss their target, and enjoy Allied vehicles standing on roadsides (in a plan of 'thunderclap surprise'). Caution should be exercised in watching history through the lens of a filmmaker, but it's hard not to think of Market Garden as a study in human ineptitude and ask how the Allied generals could've won any battles, let alone this one.<br/><br/>'Bridge' reaches its high point at the 130-minute mark when Allied soldiers become increasingly desperate to break through Nijmegen. In need of boats to move across the River Waal, a unit led by U. S. Major Julian Cook (Robert Redford) is forced to row through a smoke screen in rafts while S. S. Panzer divisions leisurely wait on the other side. Amidst these soldiers' incredible bravery, the operation takes on an air of farce, as if the Allied leadership planned these tactics while in a nightclub.<br/><br/>Richard Attenborough, whose directorial résumé includes 'Gandhi,' 'A Chorus Line,' and 'Chaplin,' has given more than enough justice to these broad events. Despite having to manage a huge cast of stars, Attenborough makes his actors work as a cohesive unit, with none of the roles taking on a cameo-like feel. His characters are interwoven through the storyline, returning to the fore at various times and maintaining their human interest. Though William Goldman's script feels clichéd and spits up encyclopedic facts to keep the viewer informed, the actors' enthusiasm overcomes most of its weaknesses.<br/><br/>The production was nicely filmed by Geoffrey Unsworth ('Cromwell,' 'Superman') and superbly edited by Antony Gibbs ('Rollerball,' 'Dune'). Composer John Addison has made a repetitive soundtrack, but gives appropriate color to the film's plot line. Interestingly, Addison was a soldier in British 30 Corps during the Market Garden operation.<br/><br/>While epic war films are nowadays compared to 'Saving Private Ryan,' much has to be said for 'A Bridge Too Far,' which offers a different perspective on how the Second World War was fought. Aside from moments of lame humor, Gene Hackman's bad Polish accent, and (for many viewers) an extreme running time, Attenborough's opus is a fitting tribute to the men who fought in an operation of good intentions but atrocious design. <br/><br/>In 2005, MGM appropriately released a collector's edition DVD set of 'A Bridge Too Far' with commentary and extras. Already in wide circulation is a 1998 disc with only United Artists' theatrical trailer supplied. Though this earlier release is lacking in sound balance, its visual transfer is well-done with minimal artifacts. The film is presented in widescreen with its original stereo track and a French 'dubbing' option; subtitles are provided in French and English. Monumental by today's standards, 'A Bridge Too Far' is an absolute must for war film collectors and those with historical interests in Europe.<br/><br/>*** out of 4<br/><br/>Roving Reviewer - http://rovingreviewer.blogspot.com"
"denhams","6","4","10","8 August 2006"," Good, but a bit hokey
","I have been researching this battle for a job I'm doing and have read Cornelius Ryan's book and watched the movie. I first saw it at the movies with my anti-war, ex-soldier father, in the late '70s and on the big screen, and thought the opening battle sequences where Horrocks' Irish Guards break out from their start lines behind a rolling barrage was pretty wild and probably an accurate depiction of war - very frightening, in other words.<br/><br/>Although this is a mostly accurate depiction of much of the operation, it suffers a bit from a touch of the Hollywoods ... a bit of nonsense thrown in here and there (although it's nowhere as bad as another piece of British war dross, the Battle of Britain - how could something so promising for so many deliver so little to so few?). As for the Brit bashing, I'm not so sure it is: Eisenhower and his staff were apparently knocked off their feet when the over-cautious Montgomery walked in with arguably the most ambitious battle plan devised in WWII and dropped it on the table.<br/><br/>One US officer is quoted as saying that he was more surprised than he would have been had the teetotal British general walked in with a raging hangover. Had the plan worked, and it might have done, the war would have been over sooner than it was and a lot less people would have died in the process. Even the US staff officers were impressed. Alas, everything that could go wrong, did.<br/><br/>The Brits, however, as any serious history buff knows, didn't stuff up everything they did: the score's about equal with the Americans - and just about everyone else involved in the war, for that matter - but it's always good sport to stereotype the English, who never seem to complain! It also makes for fun cinema. Ryan O'Neal's character, by the way, is historically accurate. He was young, and young looking, and apparently quite the dashing West Point style army officer. My favourite character, though, is Edward Fox, who plays the determined, upper-crust British career soldier to a tee.<br/><br/>Yet Attenborough's valid attempt to get the anti-war message into the movie makes it a touch hokey and it detracts. The casualty figures themselves would have been enough to inject that sentiment. Also, much of the fiercest action took place around the Arnhem Bridge and in Oosterbeek, where the close-quarter fighting between the British 1st Airborne and the SS was similar to that of Stalingrad and resulted in casualty figures estimated at 50 per cent on the German side ... and that's underplayed in the film and made a lot of the time to look like a pack of certifiably mad, stiff-upper-lipped Englishmen out playing cricket on the village green with a nice cup of tea thrown in for good measure.<br/><br/>The reason it flopped in the US may have had something to do with the fact that it was a mostly British operation and a mostly British screw-up and therefore a mostly British story. While it has appeal on that side of the Atlantic, throwing in a few big-name American actors just doesn't give it enough of an American flavour for the US box-office (but rightly so if it's to be historically accurate). The music didn't help either, but parts of the movie are great and the all-star cast does lift it beyond the mundane, if you can get past Gene Hackman's strangled-cat attempts to reproduce a Polish accent.<br/><br/>Still, it's not a bad way to pass a couple of hours, ... sorry, make that three."
"rev_fred_38","5","4","10","11 January 2006"," Well-acted but historically flawed
","The cast (just about every male American and British box office attraction at the time is included) and the acting are outstanding and the battle sanest the film has some serious historical flaws, particularly in the portrayal of the German side. Two SS division commanders who fought in the actual battle, Obersturmbannfuhrer Harzer and Brigadefuhrer Harmel, are combined into one fictional character, ""General Ludwig,"" and SS General Bittrich commanded the Second SS Panzer Corps, not the Second SS Panzer Division. This is distracting to someone who knows the actual history of the battle. Couldn't they find enough German actors to portray the actual characters? If they had done this differently, I would have rated this movie higher."

","Even with an all-star cast and more, the film fails to deliver as we see vignettes describing the situation that the English, American and other allied troops are in with regard to trying to free bridges on their way to Germany in 1944.<br/><br/>The battle scenes with the victims on the floor reminded me of those grave scenes in Atlanta in 1939's blockbuster, ""Gone With the Wind."" Everyone suffers.<br/><br/>Even the old woman, whose house is taken as a refuge for the wounded, can't stand noise and even she falls victim to a bullet when attempting to run out of the house to get a ""taxi.""<br/><br/>This attempt appeared to be a major blunder in fighting the war. Fortunately, we didn't have too much of those-otherwise, the outcome might have been different and I wouldn't be writing a review of this film right now."

There is no Wayne like propaganda,just the suffering on both sides fairly portrayed. <br/><br/>It was a big underestimation of the SS units they would be facing,battle hardened as they were. Fine performances in an all star cast,and capturing the futility and sheer blood letting of war make this an unforgettable classic.

"yakster1","7","2","4","6 December 2016"," The Last Great Epic War Film!
","I had read Cornelius Ryan's fine book before seeing the this and was eager to see the film version in the theatre especially when the cast became known. I've never understood the critics hatred for this film when it came out especially from the big names (Ebert, Maltin, Kael etc) because as evidenced here, viewers certainly like it. Although it does have its good points and bad. First off, for any lover of big, epic war films it must be seen for its production values alone. Joseph E. Levine spared no expense from filming at the actual locations in Holland to the all-star cast (more on this later). With many of the main players acting as consultants, the historical accuracy is also something for WWII buffs to revel in. Many find the plot confusing yet Edward Fox (excellent) as Horrocks explains the entire operation early in the film so we know the general outline from what is a massive undertaking. The acting, mostly from the Brits (Connery, Caine, Hopkins, Bogarde,) is pretty good whereas the Americans pale in comparison. Ryan O'Neal further stakes his claim as one of the worst actors ever with his whining Gen. Gavin and Gene Hackman sports the worst film accent this side of Jean-Claude van Damme explaining he is from ""kebec"". Another criticism is that it is top heavy with stars, with many with little screen time. If James Caan's character was cut from the film it would not deter it one bit. Same thing with Elliot Gould. You did not need an actor of that stature (back then anyway) in a bit part. Olivier also has a small part but makes the most of what he has to work with. All in all, a truly big, epic film that should be see by anyone interested in an unknown story of WWII. Just don't expect a happy ending."
"grantss","9","2","4","13 May 2016"," Superb WW2 drama
","The true story of Operation Market Garden, the Allies' attempt, in September 1944, to hasten the end of WW2 by driving through Belgium and Holland into Germany. The idea was for two US airborne divisions to take the towns of Eindhoven and Nijmegen and a British airborne division, reinforced by a Polish airborne brigade, to take the town of Arnhem. They would be reinforced, in due course and in turn, by the British XXX Corps, land-based and driving up from the British lines in the south. The key to the operation was the bridges, as if the Germans held or blew them, the paratroopers could not be relieved. Faulty intelligence, Allied high command hubris and stubborn German resistance would ensure that Arnhem was a bridge too far.<br/><br/>A very well made film on one of WW2's more controversial operations. The movie captures well the scale of the endeavour and the heroism and resourcefulness involved. While most of the scenes are from the Allied side we also see the German command's perspective, and thus the strategic situation. <br/><br/>Very realistic and historically accurate.<br/><br/>Incredible cast, probably the greatest whose-who of actors ever assembled for one movie: Sean Connery, Laurence Olivier, Gene Hackman, Robert Redford, Anthony Hopkins, Dirk Bogarde, Michael Caine, Ryan O'Neal, Edward Fox, James Caan, Maximilian Schell, Hardy Kruger, Liv Ullman, Elliott Gould, Denholm Elliott.

"dazfiddy","8","2","4","17 April 2012"," An all time classic war too
","It is rare that Hollywood makes a war movie about a disastrous campaign, and yet A bridge too far is just that and more. If you love epic war movies like Midway, The Longest Day or Battle of the Bulge, then this is for you. <br/><br/>Directed by Richard Attenborough, and scripted by William Goldman,based on Cornelius Ryan's best seller.Bridge delivers all that you need from a good war film such as courage, bravery and sacrifice. Boasting an all star cast that includes Michael Caine, James Caan,Sean Connery,Dirk Bogarde, Robert Redford and Elliot Gould, this is a must see.<br/><br/>The film focuses on the attempt by the Allies in 1944 to end the war by capturing key bridges in Holland and then advancing into Germany. It was an audacious plan, devised by Field Marshall Montgomery who believed that the Germans were near collapse. The plan, named Operation Market Garden, required a three airborne divisions to capture and hold the bridges long enough so that a mechanised army can relieve them. It was the largest airborne drop in history. It would have been an amazing victory had it succeeded.<br/><br/>Needless to say, it all goes terribly wrong. The film does not hold back in depicting the mistakes of the Allies from bad intelligence, massive egos ,poor planning and down right incompetence. The film also shows the thinking from the German side, and also we get the point of view of he Dutch people.<br/><br/>My favourite scene is the attempt by Major Julian Cook, played by Redford to capture Nijmegen Bridge by a river crossing. The paratroopers are subjected to merciless barrage of machine guns and mortars by the Germans.<br/><br/>A mark of a classic is that you can watch time and again, and still be entertained.Bridge delivers in spades."
"paul2001sw-1","7","2","4","19 August 2008"," A convincing portrait of war
","'A Bridge Too Far' is the story of a British military disaster from the later stages of World War Two, made in 1977 (at sufficient distance from the war to enable a nuanced view of the conflict). In essence, it's a conventional war movie, made on a lavish scale and with an (over?) starry cast, e.g. Gene Hackman's turn as a Polish officer is not perhaps the most convincing performance of his career. More generally, there's little casting against type, either in terms of the actors on in terms of Hollywood racial clichés: the English upper class bear most of the guilt while heroic Scots and Americans are the lions led by donkeys. What is good about the movie is it's attempt to seriously detail the full course of a complex battle; and some of the set piece scenes (such as the parachute drops) are impressive for a film made before computer animation was available, although I found the score a little too directive. Overall, the movie is perhaps too fictionalised to work as documentary, but too broad in scope to satisfy in the way of the best fiction. But it convinces as a portrait of what this war must really have been like for those who had to fight it."
"mastell","9","2","4","12 March 2008"," Maybe the best war film of all time?
","Firstly, I should point out that I'm something of a military history nut, and the conflict of the Second World War is one that I'm particularly interested in. I am a fan of most war movies, but this is one that for me stands above most of the other offerings over he years.<br/><br/>To begin with, the objective movie goer, who may have real knowledge of the conflict and specifically ""Operation Market Garden"" must be drawn to the incredible cast list. I mean, I can't really think of a better virtually all-male list, containing some of the best acting talent from both sides of the Atlantic as well as some solid continental actors. With such a plethora of acting talent available, as well as the then extremely large budget available to him, Dickie Attenborough easily had the resources to make a classic.<br/><br/>Whilst some may find the length of the film to be a bit tiresome, for someone such as myself who can't stand to see details skimped on, this helps to craft the storyline very effectively, moulding the rather hurried military planning with much of the human stories of those involved in making the military decisions not insignificant either. The contrast in characters, from the supremely confident, at times seemingly arrogant General Browning, to the brooding, doubting figure of General Sosabowski, to the fantastic General Horrocks, played wonderfully by Edward Fox. Whilst many, justifiably probably, can claim this as a ""top-down"" military film, it does not neglect looking at the actual fighting and the lower ranks involved in that. The action scenes, whilst not the crowning achievement of the film, are brutal and realistic, and complement the more actor performance driven parts of the film well.<br/><br/>Many might consider this a purely masculine film, a point which I find hard to contradict, as I don't know many (in fact none) girls who really like this film. That's fair enough, as war films generally have a massively male audience. Also, don't watch this expecting a simple Anzio/60's war film narrative. Rather, it's more for the discerning military buff, which whilst it has holes and inaccuracies in it (the portrayal of Browning, whilst very good, is a bit harsh, and in fact it was doubtful if the Guards armoured division could have broken through to Arnhem, despite what the film implies), generally it is very well made and a throughly good watch. Best war film since ""The Longest Day""."

","This is one of the best war movies ever made. I've seen it first as a kid, in a movie theater, and I was impressed. Seven or eight years later, I saw it again on TV, taped it and was equally impressed. A short while ago I bought a DVD, special edition, of this movie and my impression still holds after all these years. This is a great film, it packs so much action, humor, wit and beautiful performances by equally great actors, and directing is superb. In those days it took a lot of hard work and skill to portray the operation ""Market Garden"" which was the biggest airborne assault to this day. The film was made before CGI and all other computer wizardry, and if you compare it to ""Saving Private Ryan"", it looks a bit dated lake an old car, compared to the new one, but when that car was made using superior workmanship, it can always stand equal to anything new.<br/><br/>The one thing this film has plenty and ""Saving private Ryan"" does not, is a lot of charm and beautiful witty dialog. The scene in which Christopher Good (Maj. Carlyle), explains to Anthony Hopkins (Gen. Frost), why he is always carrying an umbrella, even into the battle, is a pure example of how this movie works throughout it's course to the downbeat but true finale. It would be hard and space consuming to list all the fine work from all the top actors, and the only thing missing in this picture, in my opinion, is casting of Steve McQueen, who sadly declined an offer of to participate, because he didn't want to appear in an ""all star"" movie.

","""A Bridge Too Far"" is a very fine film record of a spectacular Allied gamble and failure which was calculated to end World War II much earlier than it did end. Sadly, it failed, and the Soviets were the first into Berlin, setting the stage for the Cold War. As a film, it has a fine international cast, too numerous to mention. One thing that stands out is how much better the British stars (Michael Caine, Sean Connery, James Fox especially) are than the Americans (Elliott Gould and Ryan O""Neal especially). The movie sets the stage for the tragedy to come by intercutting the British, American, German military planning and deployments with scenes of Belgian civilians, both passive and resistance. The air and ground assaults are masterfully presented, as are the desperate battles in and around Arnhem to hold on in the Allied case, or to dislodge and capture the paratroopers on the German side. A good film in the tradition of ""The Longest Day""."
"JKwiat5787","8","2","4","15 July 2006"," Read the book...
","Beiung a World War II history buff, first I saw this movie, then I read the book. As a story adapted from a book, I tend, maybe unfairly, to compare it with the Harry Potter series. ""Bridge' was made with 1977 special effects technology, which had to recreate events which actually happened. The Potter stories used computer technology to conjure up a fantasy world. The comparison comes, as I said, from the fact that both are movie adaptations of books. <br/><br/>I saw the film in the theater but can't remember having been wowed by the jump sequence, which I'm sure must have been breathtaking. Likewise for the artillery bombardment which preceded the initial attack of the Irish Guards. <br/><br/>A similarity to the Potter series is the fact that due to time constraints, a great deal of background information (from the book(s))has to be left out. Some things which might be regarded as errors reflect the fact that screenwriters aren't necessarily historians. Browning, in the first meeting with the three division commanders involved, claims that 'this sort of thing hasn't been attempted before'. Not only is he ignoring the 18,000 man airborne drop into Normandy in the pre-dawn hours of June 6, 1944, but he seems to have forgotten that the Germans attacked Crete in 1941 with 20,000 paratroopers. They took the island but suffered shattering casualties in the process. Gavin may allude to the fact that there was a large-scale German airborne assault in Holland in 1940, which was targeted at bridges and airfields and suffered heavy casualties.<br/><br/>I tend to wonder what Brits think of the disparaging remarks regarding Field Marshall Montgomery which were written into the conversation between Von Rundstedt and Model. Having read other books about the war, I have a little bit of an idea of the problems that Montgomery was facing with regard to manpower. Put simply, while the Bristish soldier, man for man, is as tough a fighter as you'll find, Britain, being a small Island nation, has a tough time fielding large armies. That's why an American wound up with Supreme Command; most of the troops on the western front were ours! Put simple, Monty couldn't afford having his army suffer heavy casualties; that evidently affected his style of command. He liked to stack the deck in his favor as much as he could, before launching any operation. My main criticism of him is that he tended, as Abe Lincoln once said it, to 'cackle before he laid his egg'. Which means he'd talk about how he was going to do this and that to his enemy, then not have to cover up a bit if things didn't go according to plan. Like at the end of the movie, when Browning tells Urquhart that Monty thought that Market-Garden was ninety percent successful. It's more like an American football game, where the home team drove the ball seventy-five yards to the opponents five and came away with no points, and got a lot of players hurt in the process. How could you say that the operation succeeded, when all along everyone said that failure of any part of the operation meant total failure? <br/><br/>My main praise of the picture has to do with how much of the story got told accurately and well in the time allotted. I went back to the book to find out that Anthony Dean-Drummond, the British signalman who was worried about his radios working in Holland, was worried about exactly that, and that they failed in the manner depicted. <br/><br/>My main criticism has to do with General Sosabowski's comment at the end of the story. ""I know what let's do today. Let's play the 'war' game' Everybody dies'. If he felt that way, he should have put his comments in a letter to Herr Hitler in Berlin, who seems to have been an individual who thought that war was truly a fun thing to participate in. (?!) You have to read a lot about him, and watch movies like 'Triumph of the Will' to see that. Sosabowski's comment sounded to me like he blamed the Allied High Command for starting the war. As a Pole, he probably was on hand when the Germans invaded Poland in 1939. he should be the most rabid general Officer in that group. The British officers should be next; the order being, who's homes got bombed by the Germans? The Germans never bombed the United States, but their U-boats sank lots of our merchant ships, so that's the only reason why Gavin and Taylor might harbor personal animosity against the Germans. War is easier if you hate your enemy, and Sosabowski should hate the Germans viciously for what they did to Poland."

His unit (2nd battalion) attacked the bridge directly;While Major Cook's 3rd battalion ( the Redford character) assaulted the bridge via river assault. Nonetheless both operations were successful.

","This movie is by far the best WW2 movie I have seen. While it may lack a single main character, it has a very detailed plot, and represents the events of one of the biggest blunders during the war, in a great depth. I was not familiar with the history or the event when I saw the movie. When it was over I knew all I could about the story. Watching numerous documentaries after that did not add a single bit of information to what I have learned from the movies. The lack of a main character is indeed compensated by multiple characters in the movie, each performing great and adding to the whole picture. Not only the movie reveals the story, it indeed reveals the personal feelings of each of the heroes in detail, and makes you understand how such a blunder was possible. The overconfidence, personal pride, lack of experience, pure incompetence, politics, it is all there and much more. You can see the events trough the ayes of the solders, the civilians, the Americans, British, and Germans. When the movie is over, it will be like you have been there, and you have seen what WW2 was toward its end. With all the glory and all the disasters on both sides. What the movie may lack is a bit of better ending. While it is commonly accepted that operation 'Market Garden' was a huge blunder, at the end of the movie it appears at least as a partial success. It is impressive that trough all the horror of the movie, it keeps a signs of a good spirit, and does not leave you with only the bitter taste of the lost battles. Finally in addition to being precise to the events, and exposing in depth all the characters involved, it is very entertaining, and will keep you intrigued for the whole time. This movie is so full of events, that any form of boredom is out of question. I greatly recommend this movie to everyone."

","This is undoubtedly one of the finest war movies ever made. No other film comes close to matching the quality of the cast in A Bridge Too Far. There are a whole plethora of big name stars in this blockbuster, all at the top of their game. The film is centred around the disastrous Battle of Arnhem in which the Allies suffered heavy casualties as the Hun refused to concede defeat, despite the fact that Germany was doomed to failure in the Second World War. The film is not exactly accurate in some of its portrayals, not least the scene when Robert Redford storms one of the bridges. In real life it was a Brit who carried out that role, but Hollywood is Hollywood! Regardless, the film is superb, moving performances conveying the horrors of war. Well worth seeing."
"Wulfstan10","9","2","4","22 March 2005"," An Excellent Film About WWII
","A Bridge Too Far is among the best films out there that are actually about the events of WWII, as opposed to being simply set during the war, etc. The fact that it really aims to portray the actual events of Operation Market Garden is one of its strengths, and the film overall succeeds quite well.<br/><br/>For the most part, it is quite accurate about the events, especially as movies go. There are some things that have been changed around a little bit, and clearly some license has been taken with specifics, but on the whole the film is unusually accurate. This is true even down to very small incidents, so that essentially the specific events involving specific historic characters are for the most part basically real, rather than involving fictionalized events in a greater ""real"" historical context.<br/><br/>The film also does a very good job in cinematography, filming the battle scenes, costumes, props, scenery, etc. This is especially true for 1977, adding great realism and thoroughly helping it to fulfill its great strength of being a basically accurate portrayal of real events. The film also succeeds well at showing the heroism, brilliance, stupidity, waste, compassion, and brutality one encounters in war and those taking part in it.<br/><br/>The film also involved great efforts in terms of showing the scale of events, realistic equipment, and the like. A good example is the part showing all the Allied planes and paratroops. The main failing in this regard is the use of usually newer tanks, modified a bit, as German tanks, but this is not really worth complaining about considering the relative lack of such vehicles, etc. (unlike, say, Shermans). <br/><br/>Some seem to have felt that this movie is too long, but I disagree. When a movie is good, and the scenes are all important to show the events at issue, plot or character development, etc., then I don't care how long a movie is. Here, there may be a lot thrown in, but it is compelling and the elements are for the most part important in showing what happened, which is what the film is trying to do. To cut material out would have been detrimental to the film and weakened its portrayal of the bold (arguably reckless) Operation Market Garden and its ultimate failure to achieve its real goal.<br/><br/>One of my criticisms of the film is one that seems to be shared by many. There are arguably too many stars in key roles ranging from big to small, and this tends to focus viewers on the numerous stars and their own personae, especially since at least one of them is almost always present. However, the fact that for the most part these are good actors helps compensate for this, while some of the actors clearly were outstanding choices to play their parts.<br/><br/>On the whole, this is an outstanding film about the war. If one wants to watch a compelling, exciting, and gripping, yet fairly educational and accurate WWII film, this should be among the top choices."

","When I rented this movie I didn't have the highest expectations<br/><br/>since it only has a 6.9 on this site.  However, I was pleasantly<br/><br/>surprised by the movie and it is one of my favorites.  Richard<br/><br/>Attenborough put together a fine cast and crew.<br/><br/>The ups: Most of the cast (that is, Dirk Bogarde, Michael Caine,<br/><br/>Sean Connery, Edward Fox, Elliott Gould, Gene Hackman, Anthony<br/><br/>Hopkins, Hardy Kruger, Laurence Olivier, Robert Redford,<br/><br/>Maximilian Schell, and Liv Ullman) do a very good job in their roles. <br/><br/>I was especially pleased by Anthony Hopkins, Michael Caine, and<br/><br/>Sean Connery.  Also good was Robert Redford in a role that was<br/><br/>only meant to attract a bigger American audience (since he<br/><br/>appears two hours into the film).  John Addison's score is very<br/><br/>good; it brought back memories of classic scores like The Bridge<br/><br/>On the River Kwai's and The Great Escape's.  I could go on and on<br/><br/>about the sensational production, but I don't feel like it right now.<br/><br/>The downs: Besides Robert Redford's pointless casting, there are<br/><br/>other problems with the actors.  Ryan O'Neal just wasn't very<br/><br/>convincing at all in his role, with some of his lines sounding<br/><br/>almost purposely artificial.  Also, James Caan must have gotten a<br/><br/>face lift after The Godfather, because his facial expression is pretty<br/><br/>much the same throughout the movie.  His role at first seems<br/><br/>pointless, but then the story of the little guy had to have been told. <br/><br/>Also, man probably argue that the movie dragged on too long. <br/><br/>Since I am interested in WWII history, I realized that Operation<br/><br/>Market-Garden was an epic mission with great importance, but I<br/><br/>would've been just as happy with the movie if it was about fifteen<br/><br/>minutes shorter.<br/><br/>In the end, I was very pleased by the movie and I highly<br/><br/>recommend it.  9/10"

No problem, doesn't change history or detract from the story, God bless capitalism!  So if it's not one of the top ten war movies then it is not too far behind; an an excellent overview of the efforts and errors made by the Allies in this operation, and sticks pretty well to Ryan's approach to getting the story told.

Another viewer wanted to know if the scene in which Sergeant Dohun really pulled a pistol on a doctor who had refused to look at his apparently dead captain was real or just ""Hollywood.""  The answer is easily obtainable if one reads Cornelius Ryan's epic account of the battle, from which the movie derives its title.

"trpdean","Null","2","4","28 November 2001"," Very well done movie of conventional style
","This movie is naturally often compared to The Longest Day. Both have enormous casts of stars involved in a number of subplots telling  the story of a major campaign in W.W.II and both are taken from Cornelius Ryan wonderfully detailed books. <br/><br/>However, unlike The Longest Day, this movie is of a flawed military campaign and was made after Vietnam by a dovish older director (Richard Attenborough) with a fine but conventional style. The contrast with the graphic violence of other movies at the time and since (from Mean Streets to The Deer Hunter, Apocalypse Now to Do the Right Thing, Goodfellas to Saving Private Ryan) makes the movie's style (and its  determined use of many huge stars) appear old-fashioned. Yet you sense that the tone of Saving Private Ryan is what the director wanted - he doesn't quite get it because there are too many stories. (Had he shown only the Anthony Hopkins group at Arnheim, he may have achieved more of the effect he wanted). Thus, the movie falls a bit between two stools. It uneasily has both a derring-do musical score and a darkness about the carnage one sees in ""Enemies at the Gates"". The movie has both the sort of humor always shown in war movies before the 1970s (the roles of Elliott Gould and to some extent James Caan come to mind) and a compassion for the wounded one would see in very anti-war movies such as Platoon. <br/><br/>Overall, I quite liked the movie- the story itself is far more interesting than most movies, and the acting is quite good. The many star parts are both enjoyable and distracting.<br/><br/>I'd definitely recommend it - just know that its style isn't as harrowing in the way of movies such as The Deer Hunter, Platoon or Saving Private Ryan, nor is its content the kind of flag-waver such as movies like Rambo or made before Vietnam. It's a very enjoyable mix."

","The 1960's and 70's were filled with all-star epics that dealt with particular incidents or battles or victories or losses during World War II, and only a handful of them have stood the test of time. There just isn't enough time even in 2 hours and 40 minutes to give each of these international stars a chance to create a memorable character let alone give a great performance. Every time you turn around, there's another Oscar winner, another romantic heartthrob, another action hero on screen, and in a few incidents, their appearances are met with laughter. Gene Hackman, for example, is supposed to be a Polish general, but why did he choose to speak with an Irish brogue?<br/><br/>Ryan O'Neal and Robert Redford may have had all of the ladies hearts aflutter through ""Love Story"" and ""The Way We Were"", but they are completely wasted here. Sean Connery, Dirk Bogarde and Edward Fox are commanding in their larger roles as officers, and actually get some meatier material. Michael Caine is amusing, but basically playing Alfie in an officer's uniform. But this is a film about moments, not everything neatly wrapped up together, and this makes it a complete disappointment from the start. The presence of Elliot Gould gave wags another excuse to comment on his being in pretty much every film that came out in the 1970's. Liv Ullman is the only female among the cast of international stars.<br/><br/>The film starts with a sweet narration of where the war was going in 1944, indicating that it was only a matter of time before the Germans were smashed, but it isn't quite over yet. There are more big battles, more challenges, and definately a lot more casualties. The small moments will stick in your mind more than the big battle scenes which we've seen over and over. One particular moment involves an innocent pre-teen Dutch boy, seen earlier with his parents in a joyful moment where they realize that, even as losers in the war, it will be over soon. He later rides his bike along a country road where he is stopped by a Nazi soldier, explains himself (in German), and is allowed to pass. There is obviously some big wig at the estate guarded by rifle pointing soldiers, and tanks line the highway where he passes as well. Without saying a word, he says much, and that makes the film briefly profound. Big memorable moments include a scene where hundreds of soldiers parachute out of British planes onto dutch soil which to a German soldier in 1944 probably looked like a plague of locusts storming in.<br/><br/>The huge titles that keep telling the viewer where the setting has changed to becomes majorly distracting over a while, covering the upper part of the screen rather than more sensible small lettering on the bottom. The film surrounds efforts of the British to surround and maintain control over bridges in Germany near the Dutch border, a simple plot, but more complicated in accomplishing. The arriving British troops get a rousing, loving welcome by a bunch of inmates who have escaped from a mental institution, and later by the grateful residents of a border town near one of the bridges.<br/><br/>It is obvious that every one of these films seemed to want to out-do the previous ones in the number of planes being shot down, tanks climbing over the rough terraine turned into a battlefield, and any type of noisy explosion. On a big screen, it looks fantastic, and also includes a profound musical score, but this is nothing really all that new. Director Richard Attenborough fortunately learned by the time of ""Ghandi"" that epics work much better when focus is on character, not on action, and didn't overdo the number of star cameos that were not necessary. Once again, the German officers are allowed to speak in their native tongue with no subtitles needed, and their phony charm and aggression is obvious even then,"

","Usually when you read the term ""stellar"" applied to a cast, it's more for marketing purposes to convince us that the cast is better than we might want to think - well not so, here. Connery, Caine, O'Neal, Olivier, Bogarde, Hackman, Hopkins, Caan, Schell & Liv Ullmann all chip into this true telling of ""Operation Market Garden"" - a co-ordinated attempt by the allies to use almost anything that will fly to parachute troops behind Nazi lines. Their purpose: to secure strategically important river crossings before the enemy have a chance to blow them to smithereens. Their missions are fraught with dangers - bad intelligence, bad weather as well as a tenacious and well established enemy. The planning and actions scenes give a clear dramatic indication of just how logistically complex and risky this whole procedure actually would have been; and as war films go it is much less gung-ho. It is, however, very long - and a bit more judicious editing would have helped keep it more taut."

","I have just seen ""A Bridge Too Far, (1977). It was directed by Richard Attenborough. It has so many big, well-known stars that you might think that it was hoped that because of them, the film couldn't possibly fail. I'm thinking that they left Elvis out merely out of a semblance of modesty. However, having modern-day movie heroes as main characters did not actually translate to the vast scope of the heroic effort of the mission. The chief officer of the operation tried to liken, for our edification, the situation as the Germans are the bad guys; the paratroopers as the homesteaders; and the Thirty Corps as the cavalry. Such was the mentality of the screenwriter.
In the AHC episode of ""Those Damned Engineers,"" the arc of their story had elements of danger, the unknown, surprise, moment-to-moment taut chess-like precision moves which evinced the superior caliber of U.S. forces. ABTF is stilted and wooden. The contrast is so evident. This story should be retold in the way AHC-TDE keeps the viewers on the edge of their seats and leaves them awestruck. And so grateful for Divine intervention.

","One of the most glaring problems with this film is that Ryan O'Neal was far too young looking to be a General. Otherwise, it's a pretty fair but long film. This is the true story of Operation Market Garden, an assault that was designed to propel the Allies deep into German-held territory and capture key bridges over canals and rivers. I think the combat scenes were overall pretty well done. Michael Caine does a fine job in his role as the leader of the ground assault that is supposed to relieve the paratroopers. Trouble is, those pesky Germans put up a lot more of a fight than was expected (mainly due to faulty Allied intelligence as far as what German units were in the area). There was also some stupidity portrayed on the Allied side. Result, the ground units never reached the British paratroopers at the last bridge. (Hence the title A Bridge too Far). As I said, the film is overall pretty well done. This film just didn't grab me and I consider it to be a run of the mill (albeit LONG) war film. I gave it a 6."
"timdalton007","8","2","5","4 February 2016"," A Triumph Of The War Film Genre
","Launched in September 1944, Operation Market Garden was meant to be the battle that would be the beginning of the end of the Second World War in Europe. An ambitious plan to drop 35,000 paratroopers behind German lines in Holland before being linked up with by British ground forces, to say that things didn't go to plan would be an understatement. Based on Cornelius Ryan's 1974 bestseller, this 1977 film present a epic portrait of the incredible highs and lows of the operation.<br/><br/>Ryan's previous book The Longest Day had been turned into a film in 1962 and it is difficult as a viewer not to make comparisons between the two. Both are large scale films with large all-star casts (with the two films even sharing at least two cast members in different roles Sean Connery and Wolfgang Preiss), action sequences, large budgets and an emphasis on telling a dramatic story while sticking pretty closely to actual events. As with The Longest Day, all of these elements serve the film well. <br/><br/>Given the sheer number of characters that the film presents, the all-star cast is something of a bonus to the film. While having recognizable actors playing roles can be distracting at times, this film is a case of where that casting actually helps rather than hinders. Having actors like Connery, James Caan, Michael Caine, Edward Fox, Gene Hackman, Anothony Hopkins, Laurence Olivier and Robert Redford allows the viewer to have someone to latch onto and remember who that character is and where they are during the film's nearly three hour running time. Even better, all of them turn in solid performances that add to the film's mosaic like portrait of events though each gets a moment to shine from Fox's briefing scene as British Lt. Gen. Brian Horrocks, Connery as British First Airborne leader Major General Roy Urquhart, Hopkins as paratrooper Lt. Colonel John Frost who leads British troops clinging onto a vital bridge and Hackman as Polish paratrooper leader Sosabowski who serves as something of a voice of oft-ignored reason. Even in smaller roles are well cast including Frank Grimes's Major Fuller, Jeremy Kemp and Denholm Elliott as excruciatingly bureaucratic RAF officers and Arthur Hill as an American Army surgeon. It's a solid cast to say the least.<br/><br/>The film's production values are strong and come across at their best in the film's many battle sequences. The recreation of the largest paratrooper operation of the Second World War is no easy feat today, let alone in the pre-CGI era. Yet the film pulls it off magnificently thanks to a combination of effects, costumes and making what was likely a handful of surviving pieces of equipment (including transport planes and armored vehicles) which brings it to life splendidly. There's also some strong camera work as well from legendary cinematographer Geoffrey Unsworth as well as some incredible point of view shots of paratroopers jumping during the film's two biggest sequences. The use of location filming which often returns to the actual places helps with the film's verisimilitude as well. The editing is strong as well, especially in the battle sequences which create the air of chaos and confusion to give the viewer an idea of the ""fog of war"" first hand. Combined together with the direction of Richard Attenborough, the film is a triumph to watch from a technical point of view as much as it is acting wise.<br/><br/>Screenwriter William Goldman deserves significant praise for being able to take the 670 book and create a workable screenplay that, like the book, tells the story of Market Garden from all sides. Having recently read Ryan's book, it was surprising to see how much of the events and dialogue in the film came from the book and were well presented in the film. Indeed, many of the sequences that might seem corny and unbelievable such as the sequence where Caan's Sergeant Eddie Dohun rescuing his captain and forcing an Army doctor to look at him, Connery's Major General Urquhart becoming trapped behind German lines and many of the frustrations experienced on both sides can be directly traced to the original source material. Like The Longest Day before it (which Ryan adapted), this film allows the viewer a chance to get the feeling of history unfolding throughout.<br/><br/>Yet it does more than just play as a highlight reel of Ryan's book. Perhaps even more impressive, Goldman's script (and the film itself) captures the tone and message of the book. That brave and good men acted courageously and against great odds but for what purpose many were left to wonder. The film's final minutes portrays this beautifully with little dialogue and a haunting final scene. It's something that further sets the film apart from many others in the war film genre. <br/><br/>Which isn't to say the film isn't without flaws. Goldman's screenplay is rather unfair to British Market Garden commander Browning (play by Dirk Bogarde) who becomes something of a stand-in for British Field Marshall Bernard Montgomery who always stays off screen which might explain the odd quality to both the writing of Browning and Bogarde's performance. There is also the score from composer John Addison which is sporadic but full of a heroic tone that oddly seems out of place with the tone and events depicted by the film. Both are fairly minor quibbles though given the film as a whole.<br/><br/>A Bridge Too Far is far from your typical war film. That is in large part due to its combination of all-star cast, strong production values and attention to historic events. It's a faithful adaptation of a book that captures its sweeping vision and rich details. Despite some flaws, it's a film that nonetheless stands as an example of both its genre and good filmmaking in general. It also shows the power of film to bring history to life without being patronizing, overly dramatic or dull. That's something rare in its own right."

","Before some liberal comes down on me saying ""since when is war ever great?"" I would like to state that this is probably the last marginally-realistic ""epic"" from the second generation of war movies (1941-1977) that focuses more on the event rather than the people, as is the case with these films. The vast, expansive movie covers Operation: Market-Garden closely following dozens of grunts, generals, and civilians in the midst of it.  General ""Beanhead"" Montgomery was one of the biggest flaws of World War II and had he been in charge longer, the British Army probably would've ceased to exist because he would've suffered too many Pyrrhic victories.  Every time Eisenhower gave him the reigns to the war effort, he went off and crashed it leaving Patton to save the day. This is a shame because the British grunts of the war--as well put in the film--fought with great courage and skill, only to have their commanders make some of the worst decisions in military history. Heck, ALL sides are presenting as acting with great professionalism though the Germans are still shown in their stereotypical fashion of goofiness and mindlessness.

","The story set around and about 'Operation Market Garden' itself, seems like good enough material to make a good movie with. It however is a very complex thing when one tries to tell the story of 'Operation Market Garden' from every view point possible; Americans, the Polish, the Britts, Germans, the Dutch. This movie tells all of the stories of basically every brigade involved during the 'Operation Market Garden'. Sounds like a great and fair tribute to all those who were involved. After all I often hear people complaining when an Hollywood WW II movie only focuses on the Americans, as if they were the only ones who fought and help to win WW II. To those persons who often complain about this, I recommend them to watch this movie. They will have to come to the conclusion that a movie that tells the story from every point of view, is unnecessarily confusion, overlong and focuses on far too many characters and plot-lines.<br/><br/>The failure of the (over)ambitious 'Operation Market Garden' is a fascinating story. Had the operation fully succeeded, it would had ended the war before Christmas 1944. This movie does provide good information about the mission and the battles fought during it and the parties involved. Purely based on that this movie is a good and educational one as well. A movie however needs more than just a fascinating premise. There are several problems with ""A Bridge Too Far"" that make this movie a, what I would like to call, flawed grand epic. The movie is still big and uses lots of sets and extras but none of it really impresses since the movie tries to cover way too much of the story and focuses too little on the effects of the war on the characters. It makes the movie feel very stylized and not humane and realistic enough.<br/><br/>There are countless unnecessary sequences but above all there are way too many and unnecessary characters. The movie has an immensely impressive looking all-star cast but at the same time that also is the down fall of the movie. Basically every star of the movie is given just as much screen time. Sounds fair but it just doesn't work out well enough. The movie doesn't always flow well because of this and the movie focuses on way too many characters that remain too shallow, a direct result of the fact that the movie tries to cover too much story and characters. Sure, most actors are a delight to watch in this movie and they probably also are one of the reasons why this movie still remains a perfectly good one to watch. But just think about it. Were the Ryan O'Neal, Laurence Olivier, Liv Ullmann roles, for instance, really necessary? They add nothing to the story and you might even say that their roles only work distracting. They and many others, play roles in the movie, that in any other normal movie would had been an 5 seconds role but however due to the fact that they are being portrayed by big-name actors, the roles are far too much extended and stretched out. This really is the biggest problem of the movie.<br/><br/>A result of this all is that the movie also remains a pretty shallow one. It's just a documentary like observation of the events which occurred and it fails to capture any emotion or show the true horrors of war.<br/><br/>The movie is however a good looking one. It's pretty obvious that not all the money was just spend on the cast. The settings are good and the movie was filmed in- or directly around the places at which the events of 'Operation Market Garden' also occurred in real life. It gives the movie a certain bit of extra and adds some realism. The movie becomes nowhere exactly spectacular but there are some well filmed battle sequences that don't really impress but are good and memorable enough.<br/><br/>The musical score by John Addison is very good and makes the movie also very recognizable, unfortunately it was the only good and memorable score by Addison, at least that I know of.<br/><br/>Richard Attenborough's movies always have both hits and misses and that goes for this movie more than any of his other's. This movie has many misses but still the positive things about the movie make this a, still good enough one, to watch.<br/><br/>It still is the ultimate movie to watch if you're interested in 'Operation Market Garden', however if you like a good WW II movie that is realistic and impressive to watch, this is not a movie for you.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

"user-415-133374","9","1","2","30 July 2018"," An excellent war film...with only a few flaws
","""A Bridge Too Far"" is an excellent war film and the template for which all other Second World War epics should be compared. The history is excellent, the acting extraordinary, and the film tells in a clear and concise manner what was otherwise a very complicated combined ground and airborne military campaign.<br/><br/>With that said, there are a few notable flaws in the film. First and foremost...the miscasting of Gene Hackman. In the film, Hackman portrays the Polish general Stanislaw Sosabowski. Hackman does his best, but the acting simply doesn't work. Aside from a poorly done Polish accent, Hackman does not portray well (although he tries) the sheer dejection that Sosabowski must have experienced being sidelined by Allied generals who thought Poles were of little use in military operations. Add to it, this film for Hackman was stuck right in between ""The French Connection"" and ""Superman"". It is a totally alien character for Hackman to be playing and it shows.<br/><br/>Second, we have what is generally referred to as the ""innocence of the SS"". The late 1970s were a very interesting time for Germany and its memories of World War II. A lot of the Waffen-SS veterans were attempting to gain government recognition for military pensions and there was an overall movement building, on both sides of the Atlantic, that Waffen-SS soldiers were simply front line troops who did their duty, separate from the atrocities of the Holocaust. <br/><br/>There were certainly Waffen-SS members who were not criminals, however ""A Bridge Too Far"" portrays the Waffen-SS as an honorable fighting force which is respected by the British. Nothing could be further from the truth, in particular case of the 2nd SS Panzer Corps (figured prominently in the movie) which was deeply entrenched in war crimes and had commanded some divisions, especially on the eastern front, which had committed numerous atrocities. The 10th SS division Frundsberg, to be fair, was one of the few SS divisions which was not involved in any significant war crimes; however, the division commander Heinz Harmel asked his name not be used in the film, most likely since memories of what the SS truly stood for still lingered, even thirty years after the war.<br/><br/>Overall, ""A Bridge Too Far"" is an excellent film and highly recommended for any aspiring historian of the Second World War."

","Record breaking war movie, in sheer size of the production. Biggest production ever in movie history. ""A Bridge Too Far"" tells the true story about the invasion of Holland during WW II, which was bigger in size than D-day in France and which caused more casualties.<br/><br/>Greatest cast of movie stars ever ensembled in any movie in the entire seventies, featuring an incredible number of 14 oscar winners: Sean Connery, Robert Redford, Gene Hackman, Michael Caine, Laurence Olivier, James Caan, Anthony Hopkins, Dirk Bogarde, Liv Ullman etc. Acting performances are excellent. How could it have been otherwise, with such an unique cast of movie stars from the seventies. Everybody who was famous at the time played in it. Steve McQueen was the only star that refused to take part, because he wanted a bigger paycheck. Since this huge war movie production was already crumbling under a huge financial burden, Steve McQueen's paycheck demands were rejected.<br/><br/>This war movie became the biggest grossing box office hit in Europe, but it didnt do well in America. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, but the film was completely ignored at Oscar time for daring to expose the fatal inadequacies of the Allied campaign.<br/><br/>Almost 3 hours long, but enticing from beginning to end. Never bored me for a minute. On the contrary, even though I have seen this movie dozens of times I still get excited by it. Young people however may find it a bit long drawn at moments, because there arent lots of funny ""Star Wars"" like explosions every 10 minutes.<br/><br/>Beware: there isnt a happy ending. Director Richard Attenborough made a movie that is enjoyable for the entire family, BUT he also clearly stated that he didnt want to make a movie that glorified the war. The ending of ""A Bridge Too Far"" is a big downer. You wont feel cheery at the end at all. Therefore lots of people WONT like the ending and downrate this movie on Imdb because of it. The ending (last half hour) is true to life though, because everything is being portrayed as has happened during World War II. War aint fun, but this movie is still very glorious, uplifting and even quite funny at some other moments. Really suspenseful too, even though I already know exactly how everything will play out.<br/><br/>Endnote: there is an excellent additional bonus DVD which features hours of real life war footage from World War II including a short documentary about the making of this biggest war movie of all time.

"g-bodyl","9","1","2","15 July 2014"," Ambitious War Film!
","A Bridge Too Far is a very ambitious war film and I would even go as far to call it as the most ambitious film ever made. What makes that special is that the event the film is based on was not even an Allied victory. There was concern that people wouldn't want to see a film based on defeat, but it is more than that. It shows how the Allies will go all out to defeat the Nazis. In a time before CGI, there are some amazing visuals here, mainly the paratroopers jumping out of the planes. That was very impressive to watch.<br/><br/>Richard Attenborough's film is about how ""Operation Market Garden"" was implemented in 1944. Basically the plan was for Allied troops to fall in behind German lines and take three bridges from their command. But things go awry thanks to faulty command, bad weather conditions, dwindling supplies, and more.<br/><br/>If there is a film that has many superstar actors, this is the film to see. There are many brand-name stars and I only wish some of them had more screen-time. Everyone does an excellent job, regardless. With a cast consisting of Sean Connery, Gene Hackman, Laurence Olivier, Anthony Hopkins, Robert Redford, and Michael Caine, what could possibly go wrong? <br/><br/>Overall, A Bridge Too Far is worth watching, only if to see the ambition and creativity that was put forth into this film. This film requires patience, because it is a little overlong and there are moments without action. But all-in-all, this film gives us a first-hand look at one of the little known battles in World War Two. I rate this film 9/10."

ABTF also has an impressive cast. Did anyone else notice that even ""Cliff"" from ""cheers"" (John Ratzenberger) is in this? He portrays one of Robert Redford's men. I noticed in the ""Quotes"" section someone wrote a sentence ending with :...""World War II era bomber dropping 'ordinances'."" What a bomber would drop would be ""ORDNANCE."" There is no letter ""i"". An ""ORDINANCE"" (WITH an ""i"" is a municipal or county law. Or perhaps maybe this person DID intend to say that the bomber was dropping municipal laws!"

","An incredible production with an all star cast riding the wave of films like ""Midway"", ""Tora Tora Tora"", and trying to recapture some of the glory of old war movies like ""Tobruk"" or ""The Desert Fox"", ""A Bridge Too Far"" tells of a lesser known effort during the allied advance against the Nazi forces during the second world war.<br/><br/>I'm guessing lots of other reviews have tapped on the history upon which this film is based, so I'll skip that. But it's important to understand the context in which this film was made. As others have mentioned on the bulletin board and in reviews, there seems to be a bit of an anti- war message going on here. I think that's fair, but I also think it's important to know that this film was not only trying to recapture the spirit of the old war films, but was in fact also following the anti- Vietnam war movement, both conflict and social upheaval regarding the US inheritance of what started as a French colonial struggle had ended a few years before. But the imagery, hype and reality of the Vietnam conflict was still fresh in American minds, as well as our allies.<br/><br/>So when the film makers set to produce an old fashioned World War 2 film, they kept the modern anti-war sensibilities in mind. Ergo we get a lot of exposition regarding the human struggle as the conflict, specifically Operation Market Garden, rages on. We're treated with various scenes that sometimes don't always move the plot and story forward, but are intended to add a human dimension. The subtext is that paranoid egos dictate the scale and nature of the conflict, and that only the truly mad engage in such operations.<br/><br/>Untrue of course, but it is art. If conflict on any scale were only initiated by the insane, then we wouldn't have bar fights or fights at sporting events, nor gang warfare in urban hubs. Warfare is an extension of those basic human traits, and as such groups of humans wage it against one another when resources (tangible and political) are denied them. That's the thing that's really missing in a lot of war films, or films about any kind of conflict. It's perhaps unfair of me to put such a comment onto a film like ""A Bridge Too Far"", because the film itself deals with a specific battle, and not geo-politics of the time. We understand the context of the war itself; its origins and reasons for its conflation, and so we don't get a background history telling us why the Allies are fighting the Nazis. We understand that, so we're presented with a table setup to show us the struggle, exterior and within.<br/><br/>Does the film achieve its goals? When I first saw years and years ago the one element that really hit me was the struggle of the British detachment at the bridge. What they do and how both history and film unfold for them is something that will touch the military heart.<br/><br/>As for the anti-war elements, they're there. Some are impressive, but seem very much out of place, where others seem appropriately functional within the story itself. Again, the real history of the war was that the Nazis were trying to hold onto mainland Europe, taken through military conquest with the hopes of building an European empire. The social format for the Nazi (short hand for National Socialist) regime based upon a doctrine of ethnic superiority, and in this way a sense of entitlement. Without that knowledge ""A Bridge Too Far"", today, seems like a boisterous war film with some anti-war sentiments. I'm sure that was the original intent.<br/><br/>But does it work? As a film it's entertaining. As a message on the horrors or war, or of human psychology as to the causes of death and destruction, I think it's a failure. As an examination of the plot elements that saw what went wrong with operation Market Garden, it's mildly successful. As large as the battle scenes and other scene requiring massive amounts of extras were, there were some other scene that could've used more extras, specifically Sean Connery's sequences. You never get the sense of the size of his forces. Ditto with some of the German sequences as well. The Nazi forces are essentially a nebulous enemy to be taken on. We know the scope and emotional-size of the allies, but not their opposition. So there we see a bit of a discrepancy in size portrayal. <br/><br/>All in all a decent watch. Give it a spin on the old DVD player."

","World War Two lasted four years. When Cornelius Ryan published his book thirty years later, it became in retrospect the gigantic historical saga of the Allies' attempt to break through the German lines at Arnhem in the Netherlands. In this massive effort, the combined armies hoped to secure a number of strategic bridges into the Ruhr valley which was the Industrial heart of the German war machine. Although conceived by Field Marshal Montgomery and given the code name ' Market Garden' it was designed to be implemented and completed within 2 to 3 days. Unfortunatedly, the plan was frothed with inaccurate information most of which was either disregarded or ignored. As a result thousands of Allied soldiers were either ambushed, massacred or forced to surrender. This film called "" A Bridge Too Far "" is a monumental undertaking, directed by Sir Richard Attenborough offers a stellar collection of some of the finest movie actors available and include among others Dirk Bogarde, James Caan, Michael Caine, Sean Connery, Edward Fox, Gene Hackman, Sir Anthony Hopkins, Ryan O'Neal, Robert Redford and Sir Laurence Olivier.

","Film Review: ""A Bridge Too Far"" (Seen Nov 2008)<br/><br/>In the 1950s and early 1960s it seemed that almost every second movie was about the Second World War, but by the time this one, the story of the unsuccessful Allied attempt to outflank the Germans and secure the Rhine bridges in August 1944, was made (mid 70s) interest had waned somewhat and this movie was not a box office success, unlike ""The Longest Day"", the story of the D-Day invasion in 1944. from the same writers.<br/><br/>The basic structure used here is a number of interweaving stories; we see the action from the point of view of the top brass, the field commanders, the ordinary soldiers, and the civilians caught up in the battle. Almost all of this is from the allied point of view, though there are some scenes with the German high command (Hardy Kruger and Maximillian Schnell) which are inexplicably in German, with no sub-titles (I watched the film on Turner Classic Movies in Budapest). We viewers of course have the benefit of hindsight, but it has to be said that the British generals involved, especially General Browning (Dirk Bogarde), were over-confident in what was a very risky operation. The Americans, (embodied in Ryan O'Neal, a ridiculously young general) and the British field commanders (Michael Caine, Sean Connery and Antony Hopkins were more realistic. The weather held back Polish reinforcements (improbably commanded by Gene Hackman), the operation's plans fell into the hands of the Germans (who initially thought they were a ruse), the radios were defective, and the Allied intelligence as to the location of German tanks was also defective. <br/><br/>The film succeeds as a spectacle. There are plenty of big bangs, bullets and so forth, and the devastation of modern warfare graphically illustrated. There are so many big-name actors one has a hard time remembering them all, though some are unmissable, such as Laurence Olivier as a Dutch doctor. It is of course the story of an allied defeat, but in some ways more interesting than if the operation had succeeded (by this time in 1944 an Allied victory in Europe was in sight and only significant German thrust occurred afterwards the ""Battle of the Bulge"" in the Ardennes in late 1944). One learns more from failure than success. Somehow the Polish commander got the blame for the failure, though General Browning was sidelined afterwards as well.<br/><br/>At the end of the day a war movie is a war movie. This is not ""Apocalypse Now"" but is above average for the genre. If it had been made in the 1960s it would have been acclaimed, but by the late 70s our view of war had changed, as the success of ""Apocalypse"" demonstrated."

No doubt those who set up the operation where canonised and decorated and those killed forgotten. Richard Attenborough can feel a sense of achievement with this film which was much berated on initial release. Maybe time and real assessment can only be made when comparison is made with the rubbish known as art that now pervades our cinemas and airwaves.

Operation: Market Garden was a definite Allied defeat, and is accurately portrayed as such in the movie. The movie has what is quite possibly the single greatest cast ever assembled. With names like Sean Connery, Anthony Hopkins, Robert Redford, and Gene Hackman, among others, A Bridge Too Far was able to accomplish the goal of making a movie displaying the aspects we normally don't get to see in the genre of War films, World War 2 films in particular. No dramatic rescues or love stories added here. Though it has a few historical inaccuracies, the movie's quality does not suffer from it. The one downfall, as cited in an earlier review, is the situational confusion that ends up confusing the viewer. It is nigh impossible to be certain where characters are at any given time during the film. That aside, A Bridge Too Far brilliantly brings to light a rarely illustrated element of war, defeat, and is excellent in doing so."

After Normandy, the Allies attempt to catch the Germans by surprise by dropping behind enemy lines roughly 40,000 troops. But violating one of the first rules of warfare, they implemented the operation much too quickly and with insufficient forethought to the possible complications. Had DDay been so poorly planned, we'd all be wearing lederhosen und humming Wagner. Good ole Monty! Regarding the movie, it ironically imitates most of the miscues of the military operation that it depicts. The ideas are good, but the scope of the project was just way too large to coherently squeeze into a near 3 hour film and the disjointed multiple story lines end up zapping most of your interest in the outcome. But...I don't know if you will ever see a cast like this assembled again. Check out the names, wheeeeew!

","A Bridge Too Far is an ambitious film. It´s epic in scale, has an impressive cast, and lasts nearly three hours. It contains some brilliantly orchestrated battle scenes and stays close to historical fact. But it lacks drama and many of the actors are wasted, particularly the Americans. Only the British characters are well written. Sean Connery is particularly good as the frustrated General Urquhart. Anthony Hopkins and Edward Fox also stand out. But by the end of the second hour the film loses its momentum. Robert Redford leads a river assault to capture Nijmegen bridge but ,hair-raising though it is, the audience is bound to feel more than a little battle-weary by then, and Redford only seems to have been thrown in for our curiosity. Most of the actors are used in this way. The big scenes sustain our interest, however; the German retreat at the beginning, the immense para drop over Holland, the rolling barrage that devastates the German positions, the armoured assault by the Waffen SS across Arnhem bridge; these are spectacular. Worth a view."

","This is inferior to The Longest Day in my opinion, but A Bridge Too Far is still a pretty accurate epic and a worthy addition to the film collection of any WWII enthusiast.  A Bridge Too Far takes slightly more license with the facts than in The Longest Day, with several characters being combined into one and so on, but it is still a better movie than some reviewers have given it credit for.  One user commented that 'you just know Robert Redford is going to come through unscathed', supposedly because he is a big star. Redford was portraying real-life Major Julian Cook, who did come through unscathed, therefore the film was merely being accurate.  I thought all the actors did well with their roles, with Edward Fox being as entertaining as usual, although Gene Hackman's Polish accent sounded a little forced.  On the German side, it was a plus to have the Germans speak their own language, and I enjoyed war film veteran Wolfgang Preiss' brief appearance as Field Marshal von Rundstedt; he portrayed von Rundstedt's weary pessimism very well.  The spectacle of the massive paratroop landings was very impressive as well, and the plight of the Dutch civilians, caught between two massive armies, received the attention it deserved.

","A Bridge Too Far is a excellent movie.  It was made just as the big war movies were ending (Kelly's Heroes, Midway, etc.) and the serious, gory war movies (Apocalypse Now, The Beast) were about to begin.  It's actually more like a hybrid.  It focuses on the Operation: Market Garden abroad and not just to one squad or general.  It shows the battles without just blood and guts.<br/><br/>Movie making wise, it was wisely created but very long.  It's Cinematography was revolutionary especially for the paratroop scene.

"Marendil","10","1","2","30 November 2002"," A brilliant film, one of the best war movies of all time
","This is a meticulously accurate re-telling of Operation Market Garden, a bold attempt to end the War by Christmas, 1944.  Its cast is first rate, one of the most star-studded movies ever made.  At the time, even Edward Fox (who is exquisite in this film) and James Caan were top stars, coming off The Day of the Jackal and The Godfather among others.<br/><br/>
(Spoilers lurk below)<br/><br/>It's September 1944, the German Army is demoralized and in retreat, as the Allies have swept across the France and Belgium with startling speed. Field Marshal Von Rundstedt (Wolfgang Preiss) is re-appointed as the supreme commander of Germany's Western Front.  A bit of history is skipped over here, as historically Von' Runstedt indeed quipped ""End the war you fools"" in response to questions regarding what they should do, but in reality was not greeted with a smile but being temporarily sacked and called on the carpet before Hitler before being sent back to command.<br/><br/>To take advantage of the German retreat, Field Marshal Montgomery devised a bold plan to capture the Dutch bridges leading to and crossing the Rhine, then punch into the Ruhr with an Armor corps and capture the primary German industrial sector.  It calls for 30,000 men, the American 101st and 82nd Airborne Divisions, as well as the British 1st Paras and the Free Polish Brigade.  They will be dropped behind enemy lines and the British XXX Corps will exploit by speeding down 'Hell's Highway' and crossing the last bridge across the Rhine, the Bridge at Arnhem.<br/><br/>The score is first rate; an unforgettable inspiring tune that may confuse some as it may seem out of place in a movie chronicling a military failure. However, if you pay close attention, you'll note it picks up only when XXX Corps is on the move, the `Cavalry on the way to the rescue' as General Horrocks (a brilliant performance by Edward Fox--the best in the movie) puts it in a wonderful scene that sets out the parameters of the plan.  When I saw this when it was released, the music is what made the biggest impression on me, and even today I can hum the tune, often it comes unbidden when watching other heroic movies.  I suspect that many who object to the score see this as an anti-war movie, being an allied failure that shows how brave soldiers can be sacrificed for little gain, but this story is far deeper than that.<br/><br/>The acting is top-notch; this movie contains so many first-rate actors it couldn't be anything else.  In addition, the supporting characters are also remarkable well played.  The only complaint may be that so many fine actors mean some are only onscreen a short while, giving the impression some are wasted. Accents are mostly correct, and Americans will realize very soon that they're watching a British army in action much of the movie. Officers speak the King's English, enlisted men mainly rural and working-class accents.  In addition to Fox, Anthony Hopkins' performance is especially of note. He plays the correct Colonel Frost who brings his golf clubs and dinner jacket in hopes he'll need it, finding his unit surrounded and isolated on the last bridge for several days instead.<br/><br/>The Germans are not portrayed as soulless monsters, but brutal and pragmatic soldiers doing what a losing army needs to do in order to survive. Maximilian Schell as General Bittrich, gives a top rate performance as the commander of the SS Panzercorps division that was randomly re-deployed to the area the paratroopers will be dropping right on top of.  He can be cruel, ordering Arnhem leveled to make his defense easier; as well as merciful, allowing the British wounded to be evacuated when the Germans hold the upper hand.  Hardy Kruger does a fine job as his subordinate, a weary officer not impressed with the arrogance of many of his other superiors and willing to take things in his own hands and disobey their overly optimistic orders when circumstances require.<br/><br/>It is Bittrich's Panzercorps that foil the daring British plan.  It's pulled out of the line for R&R and deployed where it was though to be out of the way, in Arnhem.  Shortly before the drop a British intelligence officer gets reports from the Dutch underground that Panzers are in the area and even gets reconnaissance photos of them.  In reality this was Sir Brian Urqhart who would later become an Undersecretary-General for the UN, but his name was changed to Major Fuller in the movie as his last name is the same as Sean Connery's character, the general commanding the British Para division. There is a wonderful scene between Major 'Fuller' (Frank Grimes) and General Browning (Dirk Bogarde) where Fuller attempts to get the drop stopped because of the Panzer reports, and Browning explains there is too little info on them and so many drops have been cancelled that this time `the party's on.'<br/><br/>General Browning is more or less presented as the 'villain' which is somewhat unfair.  It's a documented fact his position was they were trying to go `a bridge too far,' though he wouldn't allow his reservations to inhibit his subordinates' morale.  He projected and expected a positive attitude, which some officers believe is their duty and an important part of winning battles and the war.  Also, it's not explained that some Dutch 'underground' were penetrated by the Germans and were passing on misinformation, a fact known to the allies before this assault.  In truth, the only reliable evidence he had was a few photos of tanks, and thousands of others that showed nothing unexpected in the area.  He theorized they were not fully serviceable, and pointed out the British had guns too."

","well I thought this film was excellent with an excellent cast. As an American though, I do suggest that the negative bias towards our British allies in the film was quite disdainful. They were not that inept in their conduct in the war. The film had great historical rhetoric, unlike 'saving Private Ryan'. The battle scenes are very well orchestrated. They don't rival 'Ryan', although the last battle scene at the bridge in 'Ryan' was far to ""set-up"", this film is a great one. I highly recommend it. But it's an MGM release, so the DVD version is not cleaned up as well and the soundtrack only features Dolby Surround."
"Alex-372","8","1","2","6 June 2002"," One of the greatest war movies of all time
","**POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD**<br/><br/>To me, A Bridge Too Far is one of the most memorable movies ever made, because the landscape of the eastern/central Netherlands is so much etched into my consciousness. Even though the western and northern parts (the parts below sea level) are (sea) clay and rich, the eastern part is higher and therefore so sandy that only pines and heather will grow on it. This is the landscape in which much of operation Market Garden was fought out. Market Garden is of course the story of the Allied assault across Holland's rivers, which if successful, would have allowed the allies occupy the Ruhr region of Germany, it's industrial heartland, stopping the nazi war machine from re-supplying it's tank, airforce and infantry units with much needed replacement parts, ammunition, etc. If successful, it would have ended the war there and then. In the end, the Allies made it all the way to Nijmegen, but failed to secure the last bridge at Arnhem, heroically defended by the British paras (I'm getting steamed up just writing about it), who were overwhelmed because contrary to allied command's     assertions, there were SS panzer units still active in the area. The bridge they defended has been renamed the John Frost Bridge (the character in the movie played by Anthony Hopkins). In the end, the people of the Netherlands payed a heavy price as well, because after the railway strike in support of Market Garden, German command stopped the supply of food and fuel to the west of the Netherlands, resulting in a famine which took 18,000 lives during the worst winter in living memory. As a movie, this is a tour de force, with airial landings to rival anything The Longest Day or Band Of Brothers. An all star cast is used effectively to differentiate the many units and commanders. Standouts however, are Anthony Hopkins, Robert Redford, Dirk Bogarde, Edward Fox, but especially Sean Connery, as Scottish para major-general Roy Urquhart. If I had any problem, it's with the dutch people being played by international actors Laurence Olivier (although he is pretty good of course), but especially Liv Ullman as Kate ter Horst (her Dutch is nearly completely unintelligeble, even after repeated listening). Giving credit where it is due, outstanding performances are also Hardy Krüger as SS major-general Ludwig and Maximilian Schell (The Iron Cross) as Lt.-General Bittrich. This is not a perfect movie by any means, but it is one of the greatest movies ever made, certainly one of the greatest war movies. Don't miss it."

","People criticise ABTF because of the overload on stars - but thats one of the reasons I love it - one of the last films ever I think to have that huge blue chip group in one film:  Bogarde, Caine, Connery, Edward Fox, Gene Hackman, Anthony Hopkins, Kruger, Schell, Gould, Olivier, Ryan O'Neal, Redford, Liv Ullmann, Denholm Elliott, together with a load more you'll recognise.<br/><br/> The escalation of star salaries makes this more or less impossible nowadays, and I guess that's a reason it's interesting.  The film itself is well done with poignancy but not to an irritating degree.<br/><br/> The stars aren't reduced to cameos - many of them contrary to critics make a measurable contribution to the whole, and help to emphasise that war of the 1940s wasn't like today - without computers and effective communication noone had the heck what was going on in the middle of a battle.  Deprived of working radios, these guys could be a mile away from each other and know nothing.<br/><br/> One of the closing scenes has the major allied leaders on a tower, watching with binoculars the battle a few miles away.  It is a scene - never repeated in terms of the constellation on screen at the same time - that remains unforgettable for anyone interested in the history of actors of this century, and the pleasure they have individually shown millions:  Bogarde, Caine, Edward Fox, Gene Hackman, Ryan O'Neal, Robert Redford - All staring at Connery's guys marooned ahead.<br/><br/> For this scene alone, and for what it represents this film deserves significance.  The message of the film is well conveyed through the humanity of its director Dicky Attenbrough.<br/><br/> I agree with most of the positive comments of others and appreciate the ambition of the film - like the operation it describes, it must have been a logistical nightmare to execute and I salute all those involved - one gets the feeling as a viewer of the scale of such an operation and the guts of all those involved.  Compare it with the equally ambitious but incredibly flawed Pearl Harbour - well don't - I know which film I'd rather spend $200m on."

","I first saw this film when it was released and hadn't seen again in almost 25 years until it was shown on TV.<br/><br/>In 1977 I was fifteen years old and expected my war films to be exhilirating shoot 'em up adventures. Here the film was spectacular but ended in an apparent anticlimax.<br/><br/>Now I'm approaching 40 maybe I've learned a thing or two about war. There is spectacle here and the action scenes are wonderfully staged and photographed (thanks to Geoffrey Unsworth, one of this country's greatest cinematographers). The overall impression, however, is one of waste: waste of life, waste of effort. [Poss. spoiler]Even courage is wasted, attempts to rescue trapped comrades or retrieve lost supplies end in death.[End spoiler]. I found myself wondering: ""If this is what these men are capable of in war, what could they do in peace? We need this courage to be alive among us, not slaughtered in battle.""<br/><br/>So don't watch this film to see the Allies vanquish the Hun. The Germans win the battle but will lose the war; the Allies fight like hell and fall short. Human vanity, frailty, and good old Murphy's Law (""Whatever can go wrong will go wrong"") have appalling consequences. This is a *great* war film."
"bmcclain","10","1","2","10 September 1999"," The only honest film about World War II?
","Back in 1984 I mentioned this film treatment of Cornelius Ryan's book to my college roommate, who asked, perhaps rhetorically, ""Why make a war movie about a defeat?""<br/><br/>They're all a defeat for one side or the other, I suppose.  But more importantly, war stories are about humans attempting superhuman efforts -- bridges too far -- and often falling far short of their aims. <br/><br/>
In the John Wayne - John Garfield type of war movie, the second lead dies and the hero avenges his death.  In the Rambo series, the enemy are Bad Guys who get mowed down in comic-book fashion.  This isn't that kind of shallow story at all.  It's a complex, well-paced, even-handed story about arguably the largest failed military operation ever attempted.<br/><br/>Operation Market-Garden was the largest airborne assault the world has yet seen, coupled with an armored drive not exceeded until the ground phase of Operation Desert Storm.  Had it succeeded in opening a second front into the Low Countries and down the Ruhr valley, it could have ended the war many months and thousands of lives earlier than the following May.   It's to ponder:  The desperate snowy campaign through the Huertgen forest and the Battle of the Bulge might never have happened at all.<br/><br/>What happened is surely no spoiler for anyone who read the film's title -- an intelligence estimate ignored here, a foulup with radio crystals there, missed timetables on the route march -- all conspired to strand the entire British airborne force at Arnhem.  In the film, the British resistance to the last round of ammunition is underplayed and heartbreaking, as is the Rangers' desperate attack on the bridge and Polish Brigade's slaughter in an attempted night crossing.  Again and again, I perceived the thematic thread running through the story, that war, ultimately, is normal people attempting to overcome and survive the impossibly abnormal.<br/><br/>It's honest enough to make one cringe, and yet the Germans don't come across as villains.  It's possible to feel some shock and sadness as a British officer has to shoot a young German private in the back to avoid being discovered and captured in a Dutch house.  A German officer offers a British paratrooper some chocolate:  ""Would you like some?  It's excellent. English.  Your planes have been dropping this behind our lines."""
"secondtake","6","2","7","8 June 2016"," Too long, too much, but technically very well done
","A Bridge too Far (1977)<br/><br/>A must for WWII fans, but dubious for people looking for a drama that happens to be a war drama.<br/><br/>Here's why. First the upside. This was researched and choreographed in great detail. Some of the participants were at the original battle (or nearby). And there is a sense not of grandiose ""The Longest Day"" kind of drama, but of something that shows the nitty gritty of an important but not legendary battle toward the end of the war. There is a ton of action, very vivid and pyrotechnic, filmed with smooth precision, and edited down well even though the movie is still too long.<br/><br/>The downside is partly that the movie is too long. They include too much. And frankly, as good as the action stuff is, there's too much of it. The ability to do this kind of thing really well isn't reason to do it too much. (""Saving Private Ryan"" has the same dilemma, and I think faces it better, with the amazing filming of action at Normandy.)<br/><br/>Furthermore, this is all action and all history. That's probably enough for people who are into it—and it's gripping, for sure, at its best. But the key missing ingredient is real characters. There's an attempt to give each of the stars and their colleagues enough for the audience to grasp, but it's never enough. The problems of the campaign and the personalities that pushed for it and doubted it are clear. But they aren't convincing.<br/><br/>And one of the problems is there is just too much going on for such a short movie. That's no joke. It could have been a t.v. mini-series, and the characters could have been developed. Instead we get a few minutes screen time—at best —of most of the key players. And there are a lot of big names involved, each for a million to five million dollars each. And that's with Joseph Levine (the producer) pushing hard to save money. It never feels bloated, just superficial. Oh! There's Robert Redford, there's Michael Caine, there's Laurence Olivier, and so on, with their key but tiny appearances. Don't blink.<br/><br/>So we end up back with the history, and the brutality (and spoiled brat attitude) of the Nazi Germans. It's good (and horrifying stuff, for sure, but there are lots of better WWI movies on many levels. This one is for people looking to fill in gaps and get the specifics.<br/><br/>A last note. This came out after the shift in Hollywood to newer (""New Hollywood"") films in the late 60s, and it feels out of place. Other war dramas like ""Patton"" ""M.A.S.H."" and ""Catch-22"" all from 1970 and then just after this one in 1978 and 1979, ""The Deer Hunter"" and ""Apocalypse Now,"" all offer something more contemporary and compelling in terms of style and movie-making. And character."

","We begin with what looks like archival World War II footage. After D-Day, the Allies have turned the tide. Now, they expect to defeat the Germans. In September of 1944, with the war's end presumably in sight, American and British forces embark on a mission they hope will win the war by December 1944, so everyone can be home for Christmas. Being home for Christmas is a righteous goal. The mission involves Allied troops going into Dutch territory held by the Germans and gaining control of strategic bridges. History, the title, and tone of this production leaves little doubt about the mission's outcome...<br/><br/>Knowing how it ends doesn't always mean a story can't engage. Some stories are so engaging, you can watch them over and over again. We know Superman and Batman will return, but seeing their lives put in danger can still excite. Good story-telling qualities always help. Joseph E. Levine and his director Richard Attenborough are trying to make ""A Bridge Too Far"" work, but the film is quite exhausting. There is simply not enough story for the length. Back in the 1970s, Mr. Attenborough could not say, ""Save it for the director's cut."" So, we have excess in effective acting and explosive production scenes...<br/><br/>The basic story, of a failed mission, isn't even properly presented. One gets the feeling the Allies should only try to blow-up the bridges. Simply infiltrating German-held territory is a good way to get killed. With great gusto, Edward Fox outlines an impossible mission. Later, poor Dirk Bogarde nonchalantly explains it away. We're not sure if it was a suicide mission. The original ""I'll be Home for Christmas"" goal is forgotten. The subplots involve an all-star cast, but their characters have little substance. The better performances are given by lesser names, who blend into their undeveloped roles more successfully...<br/><br/>Arguably, the leading man is Sean Connery (as Robert Urquhart). He seems to be around most often and appears in command. Like several of the big names in the cast, he is always the Actor in his Role. Even more obvious are Ryan O'Neal and Robert Redford, implicitly and explicitly giving ""Hail Mary"" passes. Elliott Gould finds his character swinging on a cigar. Gene Hackman ventures into a Polish accent. James Caan shows muscle. The non-Americans are better, with Laurence Olivier blending best into his civilian character. Olivier perfected his movie camera acting in the late 1930s and never looked back...<br/><br/>As yet unmentioned are Michael Caine, Anthony Hopkins and Maximilian Schell. All are dependable performers and succeed by not sticking out like money-making box-office movie stars. Always good, Liv Ullmann appears later in the running time. There is a distinct line of Swedish acting excellence, running from Greta Garbo through Ingrid Bergman and Ms. Ullmann. They rarely, if ever, give bad performances. Geoffrey Unsworth photography is fine, as expected, but John Addison's music really needed a better story. The production costs are obviously high. But the causalities are even higher.<br/><br/>***** A Bridge Too Far (6/15/77) Richard Attenborough ~ Sean Connery, Ryan O'Neal, Robert Redford, Laurence Olivier"
"aramis-112-804880","6","2","8","11 August 2015"," Never Finds its Footing
","In the late 1970s Richard Attenborough, well known actors (""The Great Escape"") had done some directing and was anxious to make his David Leanesque hagiography of ""Gandhi."" To further establish himself with the moneymen, he had his arm twisted to show his stuff in ""A Bridge Too Far.""<br/><br/>""Bridge"" itself is a strange amalgam. Before, World War II movies were made to build up and honor the men (and women) who had fought, or died, or come home, after defending the world against Hitler. They were fairly simple. Hitler=bad. Anyone fighting Hitler=good.<br/><br/>But then a generation grew up who knew not Hitler. And they were unwilling to fight the USSR or its proxy Ho Chi Minh, because their ideals were the same. And they undercut war efforts any way they can, even by blatant perjury (cf. John Kerry). To the people who grew up without Hitler rattling his sword in their back yard, war was bad in every circumstance. Especially against Socialist or Communist totalitarian states that were Hitler-like but didn't have funny mustaches.<br/><br/>So along came ""A Bridge Too Far"" based on a monumental study of the Operation Market-Garden Campaign by Cornelius Ryan (""The Longest Day""). It suited the times well, since it showed a World War II campaign that went woefully wrong through a sheer case of ""Murphy's Law."" It even suited the times culturally, since the Germans in the film (Hardy Kruger, Walter Kohut, Maximilian Schell) are not really bad guys, they're just by accident of birth playing on the wrong team.<br/><br/>But how to market such a movie? Those who hate war (and America, btw, who came out on top in World War II) don't want to see a war movie anyway; however badly it goes, it won't match their imagination. And those who want to see Hitler kicked in the pants will see the allies kicked in the pants and Hitler triumphant. <br/><br/>The decision: advertise it by stars. Sort of a uniformed ""Murder on the Orient Express."" Back then, the more stars features were able to shove into little boxes on the posters, the more easily they breathed.<br/><br/>Movies were strange in the 1970s, and no one knew which way they were going to flop. They were still churning out the occasional extravaganza, but little, handmade pictures were also popular. Until ""Star Wars"" showed the way, they were all groping in the dark. And stars were strange in the 197s, too. Elliot Gould was a major star, and he got chosen (other unlikely headline stars like Alan Arkin and George Segal! did not).<br/><br/>So, Elliot Gould. When Steve McQueen proved too prestigious, they got, of all lousy choices, Robert Redford (for two million--a pretty penny, back then). Ryan O'Neal. And James Caan, another unlikely choice for being hot, thanks to ""The Godfather."" They went on to sign James Bond himself, Sean Connery. And a series of English actors prestigious (Olivier) and popular (Michael Caine, Edward Fox). They were after bankable names.<br/><br/>The most controversial was Dirk Bogarde, as Gen. Browning. Not that Bogarde, another big name of the era, was controversial. But the film, rather than book, rather hung the whole debacle of ""Market Garden"" around General Browning's neck like an albatross. Bogarde, who knew Browning in the war, hated his own portrayal and his relations with Attenborough cooled as a result.<br/><br/>Oh, and a very lively Addison score.<br/><br/>Add it all together, and what do you have? Well, the film was important to me. I got my learner's permit that day and drove the family to the theater (all but my mother, who never liked war movies of any kind). So I was impressed by it on the big screen. But seeing it later on TV I thought it relied less on its storytelling ability or its cinematic scope or its acting, than in blowing up things.<br/><br/>Overall, a sloppy mess, sort of like the Operation Market-Garden itself. It throws in a lot of soppy anti-war-clichés, but also a lot of heroics (Robert Redford has the job of leading what has been called one of the bravest action of any war, not just WWII, and for a disgustingly healthy paycheck).<br/><br/>Overall, who wants to see a movie where Hitler wins?"
"meritcoba","5","2","9","5 June 2016"," Death in color..
","When the allies dropped four airborne units(one a Polish brigade) into Holland near the end of 1944, only to have one of them defeated by unexpected resistance from German units and cheering crowds of Dutch, nobody took in account that they would make a movie about it some decades later. Perhaps if they had known, then their decisions would have been different, not that war gets to be more or less tolerable either way. <br/><br/>Cornelius Ryan provided the source material for the movie and if you want to try your hand on a book that holds the middle ground between a historical narrative and something readable 'A bridge too far' is certainly recommended. Ryan wrote several more books about the war, the Longest Day being also made into a movie some years prior to this one, but the one about Berlin never got made. Perhaps times had changed or that book was too much about German women raped by dudes from Siberia, I can't tell. We have Der Untergang as a substitute nowadays.<br/><br/>Mentioning the Longest Day reminds me of a question that has plagued me for a while now, which is: how and why did Sean Connery get to be promoted from Corporal in the infantry to Major-General of an airborne unit? This minor question is at the heart of the movie and it never gets explained. You might think I am pulling your leg, but after having seen this movie just now, this question actually is just a subquestion of the bigger one which goes: where are the people in this movie? <br/><br/>The movie plays out like a documentary filled with a fair share of Monthy Python stereo types, but without the intended silliness, and otherwise bland Americans. But maybe I am mistaken about intentions? The movie seems more like a race about who makes the least dumb mistakes and the Germans won, but only by a margin. Or perhaps we can say the Poles and Americans would have won, had they not been on the same team as the British. <br/><br/>This movie is noticeable different from that other Ryan movie where mistakes where made, but John Wayne was there to safe the day. Here no amount of upper lip stiffness, jolly ho hum and cigar gnawing can turn the impending defeat in anything else but one. And the funny bit: the Germans do not even have to lift a finger, just talk among the high brass a bit.For war is the business of high ranking officers who get mentioned in books and movies, the rest fulfill their duties by killing or getting killed.<br/><br/>While the star studded cast executes their moves, the only people who remotely resemble people are the Dutch, but again, only by a margin. The most silly is possibly James Fox who gets this amazing scene in which he drives past the troops under his command Jolly greeting those who are about to die. Dickie old boy, how is the leg? Still twitching, sir. Brave lad! Next scene sees Dickie's tank being brewed by a German 75 mm Pak, despite 25 pounders bombarding their position. Which makes one wonder why them Germans are only bombarded by airplanes after they shot to pieces the advance squad or why the English didn't use something heavier. But I am no general.<br/><br/>Some scenes later it is the Brits turn again to do something dumb by executing a frontal attack on a pillbox under the cover of broad daylight. Let's try that at night next time Hannibal Lector says. That is called learning on the job, for you. Pity it took some dead soldiers to learn that lesson, but I am sure he is used to dead bodies. The Germans some scenes later outdo the Brits by sending an armored recon unit across the enemy held side of the bridge which results in amazing carnage that has inspired painters. There is nothing so gripping as burning wrecks and dead bodies to inspire artists. <br/><br/>By this time one wonders what kind of movie this is supposed to be? If someone said it is an anti- war movie, than I might believe them forthwith. But we will never find out I suppose and the only thing one can say is that compared to that earlier Ryan movie it has far less people in it, but then, this one is in color, so who is complaining?"

","Although filmed on a spectacular scale and based on Cornelius Ryan's best-seller about a huge military blunder during World War II, A BRIDGE TOO FAR tries hard to keep the viewer enthralled for three hours but narrowly misses because William Goldman's screenplay had too many facts and incidents to relay. Not that this is a failure by any means--but it tends to become tedious after the second hour with one disastrous mishap after another being played out.<br/><br/>What holds the attention throughout is the presence of an all-star cast, all performing extremely well, some of whom have only cameo roles. But Sean Connery, Michael Caine, James Caan, Edward Fox and Dirk Bogarde each make strong contributions with Connery outstanding in the largest role.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are as realistic as anything ever filmed--sometimes painfully so--and there is a stark realism to the entire story under Richard Attenborough's taut direction. <br/><br/>As good as William Goldman's script is, three hours is a long time to spend on an overwhelming military blunder. If everyone had listened at the beginning to Gene Hackman (as the leader of the Polish brigade) the outcome might have been different. Perhaps his Polish accent was too strong for anyone to understand him. He had me looking for subtitles.<br/><br/>John Addison's military score is effective but nothing that lingers in the memory--as, for example, the military tune for BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI. <br/><br/>

"filipemanuelneto","4","1","3","21 April 2020"," An epic film, a documentary or a public trial?
","This film is one of many war films, based on World War II events and operations, that were made during the 60s and 70s. In this specific case, the film brings to the screen the famous Operation Market Garden, which took place in 1944, and that was a military disaster for the Allies.<br/><br/>The idea of this military operation was to conquer a series of bridges over Dutch rivers and canals, paving the way for the Allies through German defensive lines in the country. With the Dutch plains and the Rhine over, Germany was in sight. For this, large scale parachuting and armored troops were used in order to take full advantage of the speed and the element of surprise. However, the plans were based on a misconception of the true German military force stationed in the region. In fact, the Germans had far more troops in the theater than the Allies thought, so that the German reaction to the attack was faster and more energetic than expected, considerably delaying the Allies' progress, leading to more human and , ultimately compromising the success of the operation. For a better idea of what this failure was, the Allies lost more soldiers here than in the entire D-Day operation.<br/><br/>This film, like many war films of this time, has no script other than the military operation, which is a historical fact. Of course, the way some historical characters were shown is not accurate (General Browning is an obvious case, and the film makes a bad judgment on him) and the lives of anonymous soldiers are fictional. But this is a film by Sir Richard Attenborough, who was detailed and liked films with touches of realism - Gandhi is his most perfect example and looks like a documentary. Here it is the same: the film looks like one of those fictional recreations that are now common in history documentaries, only in epic proportions. This has a good thing: the details and production values were meticulous and everything seems extraordinarily real, from the sets to the costumes, from the sound effects to the special effects and combat scenes. Cinematography is equally good, although obviously dated, and it is clear that it is a film with several decades. But I handle it well. Worse was dealing with the length of the film: it had little script for a three-hour film.<br/><br/>Finally, one last word for the cast, where there are several actors that we know very well today. Movies like this are almost nests of stars, and that sometimes turns against the film itself. Sean Connery is one of the most resonant names and was already a renowned actor at that time. He did not disappoint, achieving one of the best performances in the entire film. Walter Kohut and Ryan O'Neal did quite well too. Dirk Bogarde was fine, but his character is totally ill-considered and does not correspond to reality. Gene Hackman, still relatively discreet, comes to us with a super forced accent. Michael Caine and Anthony Hopkins go relatively unnoticed among so many others.<br/><br/>Too long, this is a film with documentary ambitions, with many good actors appearing discreetly and some characters, based on real people, being the target of an authentic public judgment. It works, but there are better."

","Probably no event in history has received more attention than WWII. Nevertheless, Richard Attenborough's sweeping epic captures a failed battle during that war. ""A Bridge Too Fair"" focuses on Operation Market Garden, wherein US and UK troops developed a false sense of security from D-Day. September 1944 got spent trying to take the Netherlands from the Nazis...to no avail.<br/><br/>This isn't a good guys vs. bad gays movie. The characters are simply who they are.

"gab-14712","8","1","3","18 October 2017"," Admirable Effort!
","An admirable effort. That is what I can call this 1977 Richard Attenborough feature A Bridge Too Far. This movie had all the ingredients to become a war classic. A great director, an all-star cast (and that is putting it lightly), a World War Two story that no one seems to know about, and the promise of Nazis being destroyed. The thing is, the film does not live up to its full potential. In that sense, the movie is a slight disappointment. I wanted to really enjoy the movie, but I mostly got mild entertainment. Based on from what other people say, my opinion seems to be what the majority thinks. A good war movie, but it could have been much better.<br/><br/>Now why exactly isn't this movie heralded as an all-time favorite? I actually think the main reason lies in the story itself. The story is interesting, but it is about an Allied failure. People don't want to see that, especially since the time of this mission was occurring as the Nazis were loosening their hold on Europe thanks to the strong Allied efforts. The movie also pushes three hours long, and the movie moves very slowly at times. This war film actually holds the least action in any war film I can ever remember. That is impressive considering the running time of the movie. My main concerns are the constant repetitions and the long running time.<br/><br/>That being said, there are some great things about the movie. Being a history film, the creators have the liberty to change the story to make a better movie. Not here. I value the historical accuracy, and I actually found it to be what kept me engrossed in the movie. It was a story I did not know much about, so I found this to be a learning tool. I also really enjoyed the performances from the cast. If you want a great cast, just check this film out. With a cast featuring Sean Connery, Gene Hackman, Anthony Hopkins, James Caan, Laurence Olivier, Michael Caine, and Robert Redford just to name a few. At the very least watch the cast do a fine job, even if some of their roles are glorified cameos.<br/><br/>So let's dive into a history lesson. This movie was about an unsuccessful Allied mission called ""Operation Market Garden."" It took place in September 1944 in the Netherlands and Germany. Basically, there were two sub-operations. The first operation consisted of Airborne forces being parachuted behind enemy lines to capture several bridges. That would allow the next operation, the ground forces to advance and cut off the heart of German industry. Mainly due to bad luck, poor communication, and bad weather, this operation failed at the Arnhem Bridge when the Allied forces at the ridge was overran, thus delaying an Allied victory.<br/><br/>Despite some problems, I thoroughly liked A Bridge Too Far. I consider it to be a serviceable war film because it does the story justice. The movie had strong potential, but I guess it wasn't meant to be. Strong performances are everywhere (especially from Anthony Hopkins and James Caan). The movie does have strong visual effects that thoroughly complement the story. So I guess that is another plus. I loved the admirable, ambitious attempt famed director Richard Attenborough did in trying to make this a masterpiece. I can see he tried so hard, but he does get somewhere with that effort at least. If you want to see a quality bridge film during this era, definitely watch The Bridge of River Kwai before this film. But if you're a sucker for war films, then this is a good one to watch.<br/><br/>My Grade: B-"

","The casting was brilliant except for Ryan O'Neill who was way too young to play the part of an American general. This was of course a true story, unfortunately it was filmed from an American viewpoint and some of the facts were distorted. Believe it or not, the Brits drink less tea than coffee!<br/><br/>This is not a film for everyone but there is something for everyone in it. After seeing this film you may have some insight as to why the British paratroopers have gained the reputation as being the toughest airborne troops in the world. Their nickname ""The Red Devils"" comes from the color of their berets and that has now been copied by almost all of the other airborne divisions from countries around the world."

","""A Bridge Too Far"" tries to follow in the footsteps of the other film based on a Cornelius Ryan book ""The Longest Day"" by relying upon a passel of international movie stars.<br/><br/>But the secret of ""TLD"" is that it succeeds for a different reason-namely the incredible atmosphere created by both black-and-white cinematography and the unusual technique of having multiple directors. ""ABTF"", unfortunately, lacks any sense of atmosphere at all, and consequently winds up as a series of vignettes in search of a soul.<br/><br/>There are some highlights from the cast, however; specifically Edward Fox as Lt. Gen. Brian Horrocks, who positively brims with conviction; and Anthony Hopkins' beautifully understated performance of Lt. Col. John Frost, which really anchors the film once we reach Arnhem.<br/><br/>But there are some equally dreadful lowlights as well; Ryan O'Neal is unbearable as Jim Gavin in a portrayal that manages to reduce one of the most enigmatic soldiers in American history to a whiner you want to slap every time you see him. And Elliot Gould is simply ridiculous.<br/><br/>The battle scenes, while containing a great deal of authentic equipment (though no one ever gets German tanks to look right), feel merely like a bunch of reenactors getting together for a weekend of fun. The whole movie tries to give the impression of sincerity but has the quality of a history lesson without any heart whatsoever; and that is the worst way of all to experience history."

","It is a film that might have benefited from a Jayson Blair rewrite: Just as Anthony Hopkins as Colonel Frost and his Red Devils are about to collapse against the might of two SS armored divisions, suddenly a rumble sounds across the Arnhem Bridge as the tanks of XXX Corps dash through. Out of the turret of the lead Sherman pops Tom Hanks as Capt. Miller, asking if Frostie needs a hand with these pesky Krauts.<br/><br/>Of course, that's not how ""A Bridge Too Far"" ends, and it's that historical accuracy that cost the film at the box office, that and ""Star Wars."" It's a film that hangs around in the public consciousness mostly because of its metaphorical title, and as the curtain-dropper for the argument whether Montgomery or Patton was the better commander. But its downbeat nature, and sometimes scattershot narrative, keeps one from embracing it too closely.<br/><br/>That said, its one of the best war movies ever made for about an hour or so. Then the paratroops start to fight for the bridges and the fog of war slips in. Where is XXX Corps? Why is 1st Airbourne split apart? Is James Caan with the 101st or 82nd? What was the real story with the bridge at Nijmegen? These are individually small caveats, but they mount up.<br/><br/>Sir Richard Attenborough is often an annoyingly pedantic director, but he's great here despite overselling the Colonel Blimp angle with the British high command. The opening scene, with the Dutch family quivering under a candlelit nimbus straight out of Vermeer as the news of German retreat fills them with an almost unbelieving hope, is sublime setup for all to follow, and the battle scenes around Arnhem have a realness to them that's both painful and rousing.<br/><br/>The acting is hit and miss. The Brits have it decidedly better, with a store of great performances. I started out liking Edward Fox best as the plummy and affable General Horrocks, sort of a UK Patton without the killgore attitude. Then I took to Dirk Bogarde's General Browning, who is made the heavy probably because Monty was still alive when the film was being filmed, but carries a real human pathos beneath the smug bluster. Now I really like Hopkins' Frost, especially that wordless scene near the end when Maximillian Schell offers him a chocolate. A masterpiece of underacting from Hannibal the Cannibal, but he's that good all the way through.<br/><br/>Who isn't so good is Hackman as the Polish general (strange he is made such a whiner in the script), Olivier's tentative Dutch doctor, and especially Liv Ullmann. Her prayer for the soldiers to have a few moments to die in peace comes across as icky and false, as does her near-tears delivery throughout. Ryan O'Neal seems the first general made entirely of wood, and is outshone by the no-name playing the other U.S. airborne commander.<br/><br/>The second half of the film, drenched in blood and chaos, falls beneath the standard set at the beginning probably because it rubs our nose too much in all that went wrong. Historical accuracy without nimble storytelling can be off-putting, as is the case here. It's never a bad movie, and the river crossing at Nijmegen is crisp and intense, but like the Allied advance itself, ABTF kind of pulls up short without an adequate reason why.<br/><br/>Incredible score, though. That was something I used to hum in my head for days after seeing it in my youth, and it really carries across the sense of joyous expectation that informed the Allies at the mission's outset. Pay attention to how its cleverly reconfigured during the drop and the Bailey Bridge building; it tells the story as well as anything on the screen."

","War inherently is a cinematic subject, particularly 20th century warfare. Filmmakers find resonance between the subject and the craft because of the similar constructions: armed forces and plans, which mirror actors and scripts. Explosions, gore and death are expected, so the actual drama usually hinges on leveraging tension, or an ironic outcome.<br/><br/>'Market-Garden' was one of the war's biggest ironies -- an overwhelming invading force that was halted mostly by fate and accidents favoring the last-ditch opposition in the West. So in that sense, the movie 'captures' the irony.<br/><br/>The story itself seems jumpy and disconnected; on the other hand, you could give each day of this 9-day battle its own feature. So squeezing something comprehensible into 3 hours is impressive. This is why the ensemble approach is necessary -- we need recognizable faces to anchor the thing.<br/><br/>Mostly it's a downer...an alien observer would think the Allies lost the war. But it is refreshing today to see actual planes, actual parachutes, and actual hand-held footage -- the actual material of that war and the *filming* of that war -- in contrast to computer generated verisimilitude."

","William Goldman adapted Cornelius Ryan's non-fiction WWII book from 1974 detailing Operation Market Garden, wherein 35,000 men were dropped behind enemy lines in the Netherlands: two divisions of U.S. paratroopers were responsible for securing the single road (a sticking point) and bridges up to the city of Nijmegen, while a British division was to land near Arnhem and hold both sides of the bridge, supported by a brigade of Polish paratroopers. The operation, a failure, was intended to allow the Allies to break through German lines and seize the bridges in the occupied Netherlands. Extraordinarily detailed and well-researched document, somewhat hindered by the sudden appearances of Elliott Gould or Robert Redford or James Caan. All-star films (particularly disaster movies or large-scale epics) were commonplace in the 1970s, but today the anachronistic appearances of so many famous faces works against the film's seriousness as a document of wartime. Technical aspects are all first-rate. Geoffrey Unsworth's cinematography is wonderfully vivid in the outdoor scenes of strategy and battle, but he can't do much with the classroom sequences of various major generals studying the plan of attack laid out by the commanding general of the British Airborne Forces Corps (Dirk Bogarde), who acts sinister although he isn't intended to be. Worthwhile for historians, yet director Richard Attenborough's attempt to give personality to as many of the players as possible stretches out the running time for a war-movie too long. ** from ****"

Similar films, such as ""Midway"", seemed to spend ALL the budget on stars and there was little left for anything else...such as a decent script or the limited and appropriate use of stock footage.

Again and again, you see troops being tossed into various fronts...with mostly expected results since you know ultimately the Germans won this battle and pushed off the offensive. It's competently made and the director used some creativity to make the battles seem more realistic (such as the use of fake Sherman tanks...as discussed in the IMDb trivia). My only reservations are the film's length, the odd casting of Gene Hackman (what WAS his accent?!) and the way the film seems to go out of its way to portray General Browning as a complete horse's butt...and I am not sure if this is reasonable or not.

","Like the battle itself in real life, the film A Bridge Too Far had mixed results. Most of the performances were either adequate or very good, but there were a few red herrings as well. Elliot Gould was terrible as an Airborne officer. He just doesnt have what it takes. I was in the Airborne in North Carolina and Gould played the role like a cartoon character. I hate actors who do that. Another completely unbelievable character in the film was Ryan O'Neal, who has about as much military bearing as Jack Benny. Some roles were well-acted, however, with James Caan in a standout performance, as well as the dependable Gene Hackman as a believable screaming eagle. Maxmillan Schell and Hardy Kruger were very good as Germans, and Liv Ullmann and Laurence Olivier were sound as well. Michael Caine and Anthony Hopkins, two of my favorite actors, seemed to get lost in the dialogue and storyline. Richard Attenborough, who is a consummate professional, was merely making this film to get funding for the highly successful Gandhi; a good parlay for him. The worst part of the film, however, was the music, by John Addison, who was the score writer for the happy-happy Tom Jones film. He is very good with light music, but this film is the antithesis of light music, and required a heavyweight musical score in the style of Elmer Bernstein or Maurice Jarre.

"antimatter33","8","0","1","9 June 2019"," Difficult to evaluate, but virtues far outweigh defects
","First - for war film buffs this film is a great treat that bears repeated viewings. There is great attention to detail and period accuracy, all done in rich color and sharp focus. A true fleet of C-47s was assembled to make the spectacular sequence covering the airborne drops. The walking barrage of the Irish Guards is reproduced with terrifying force. The inner city fighting has a closeness and tenseness that proves that effective battle cinema need not be peppered with severed limbs and exposed entrails. The uniforms, rank insignia, and equipment on all sides are done with historical accuracy in mind. The actors have been chosen for their resemblance to the characters they enact. No film about WW-2 was ever done with such attention to accurate detail. And the history itself, the course of the battle, is well represented, at least to those who already understand the course of events.<br/><br/>And that brings us to the second point - the plan for battle itself was so complicated that perhaps director Attenborough could have done a better job laying out the rationale behind the plan, and given more attention to elucidating its individual components - perhaps by onscreen time and place markers, as was done in ""The Longest Day"". It is easy to get confused, and easier still because of the richness of what is seen on the filmmaker's canvas. There is little time to pause and think about how the various events are connected either in space or in time. For example, although I had a fair understanding of the battle, I had to remind myself which side of the river the Germans were on - and of course it was (mostly) the north side at Nijmegen, and the south side at Arnhem. Indeed, the films greatest expository flaw is in failing to consistently distinguish by cinematic clues the spatial relation of the towns, waterways, and bridges, and the disposition of the attackers and defenders among them. By the time the Poles enter the battle, a viewer without foreknowledge will find himself completely confused about who is where, and what is actually happening.<br/><br/>And that, in my opinion, is a grave defect in this otherwise magnificent film, and one that keeps it out of the very first rank of martial films. Nevertheless, I give this last of the great WW-2 epics a well-earned 8/10 for its ambition and its attention to detail. And of course, with repeated viewings it becomes easier to sort things out."

In fact, the plot as a whole is quite hard to follow in the course of this overlong and over-repetitive screenplay.<br/><br/>Best-known of the officers is Frederick Browning (Dirk Bogarde), commander of the Airborne Division, who is generally blamed for going into denial about enemy strength. He declares that the wehrmacht is down to schoolboys and pensioners, and when shown a picture of several tanks beside one of the bridges, he claims they're not operational. But neither Bogarde nor any of the others is able to carry conviction as a regular officer, who has spent his whole career deferring to higher authority. Sean Connery and Michael Caine in particular are unable to camouflage their rebel blood. More believable, at least, is Edward Fox as the sociable and popular Brian Horrocks (""Pack my dinner-jacket""), who gets a loud cheer as he delivers a briefing.<br/><br/>Interestingly, the German officers are all shown speaking German, with no dubbing or sub-titles, clearly meant as a decisive step away from the German accented cod-English that filled-up all those cheap black-&-white war-films of the 50's.

To go into detail about every plot line would be too extensive, but this is a very heavy, dramatic, tense film with lots of featured battles and missions.<br/><br/>While other war movies were rewarded with Oscar nominations or wins, this film was completely ignored during the awards season. The direction and production values were impeccable, and with an all-star cast to draw audience appeal, I have no idea why the film wasn't nominated for anything.

Yes, everyone gives their all in the movie, but the two mentioned actors put a great deal of emotion into scenes where the script didn't give them much to work with. Sean Connery is the man who hears the title line, ""I always felt we tried to go a bridge too far,"" spoken, and his reaction is multi-layered and perfect. Robert Redford is given the line, ""Half my men are killed, and you're just gonna stop and drink tea?"" which could have sounded corny and awful, but he turns it into something worthy of an Oscar clip.<br/><br/>In lots of war movies, there are a couple of lead characters who survive the entire film, and one person who ""buys the farm"" and doesn't make it home. A Bridge Too Far isn't the typical war film of earlier decades; it's more similar to Saving Private Ryan or Glory. There are dozens upon dozens of characters, and lots of people die. Be prepared. This is a very tense movie, and sometimes it's difficult to watch. Robert Redford is given a mission to take his men across the water, and the Germans start shooting at them from the bridge they're heading toward. They can't shoot back because they need to use all their strength to keep rowing to safety. Redford and his soldiers start repeating ""Hail Mary, full of Grace"" over and over, knowing at any second they could be killed mid-prayer.

","A Bridge Too Far falls under its own weight in many ways with a lot of distracting cameos and an overly bombastic score. Also, it stumbles right out of the gate with a completely historically inaccurate and oversimplified narration that certainly angered any veterans of the Eastern, Italian, or African Fronts by erroneously claiming that up until D-Day the Germans were winning the war. Much of the rest of the writing falters under banalities and clichés, with some real life historical figures such as British General Browning and German Field Marshall Model portrayed as utterly incompetent (winning The Battle of Arhhem only because of luck and British hubris rather than due to his own ability). As usual for most old-fashioned war movies, the Germans are portrayed as largely heartless and often doltish with the Americans heroic, the British pompous, and the Poles and Dutch as noble victims of their circumstances.<br/><br/>However, the film has a lot going for it that World War II films up to that point hadn't done. The battle scenes manage to attain a level of chaos, brutality, and realism unmatched for another 20 years. In addition to showcasing a lot of fairly accurate equipment, the action is edited well with great sound design (aside from those squeaky ""beep"" ricochets) and pyrotechnics. The scene where XXX Corp. first encounters the German lines with its devastating artillery barrage and then stumbling into an ambush ranks among my favorite war scenes, accurately portraying the sheer wide-scale savagery and how quickly great plans can fall apart.<br/><br/>As usual for ""big"" movies of the time, there really isn't a plot or character arcs because of just how many overlapping stories and vignettes there are. A few bigger stars like James Caan, Robert Redford, and Elliot Gould get only 2 scenes - one small one to introduce their character and one larger one in which they do something memorable to service the action, usually calling back to something their character said in their introduction as though each one had some vaguely ironic prescient ability. Some of the stunt-casting actually makes the film worse, such as Gene Hackman doing his best but completely failing to fool anyone into believing he's Polish.<br/><br/>History buffs, such as myself, will get a big kick though out of the straightforwardness of the presentation of Operation Market Garden. It's interesting even to see the generals posit over maps and see their plans come to fruition inter-cut with the small stories of the regular people on the ground. The operation certainly deserved a big picture to tell its story and with impressively mounted spectacle in the age before CGI and visual effects. The larger screen you watch it on and the more interested in WW2 history you are, the more impressed you'll be."
"antagonist117","6","0","4","7 December 2013"," A great production marred by a weak script and lazy characterizations
","As this script tells it, Operation Market Garden was a guaranteed failure from the beginning. Virtually everyone from the top of the command chain to the bottom knows it, Americans and Brits and Poles know it, the Germans know it, and they all say it in no uncertain terms. Had this been the case in reality, it is too far a stretch of the imagination to believe that Montgomery and Eisenhower and their civilian superiors would have approved it. Similarly, the script's characterizations are too plainly communicated. The whole needless arc of a gruff non-com (James Caan) and a scared young officer who looks to him for protection is predictable from their first exchange. The movie's casting is hit and miss. It's packed with A-listers, and while some are excellent in their roles and bring much-needed subtlety to the proceedings (see Sean Connery and Anthony Hopkins and their long-awaited radio exchange), some are just distracting (see Robert Redford's shameless mugging and Gene Hackman's embarrassing attempt at a Polish accent). Yet despite its many problems, ""A Bridge Too Far"" is an impressive production and a fun one. The quality of the action set pieces matches or exceeds those in classic WWII films like ""The Longest Day"" and ""The Battle of the Bulge."" A paratrooping scene in which the sky becomes choked with planes and people is shot from every possible angle, including the point of view of the nervous jumpers as they slowly fall to earth. The combat sequences show with humanity and intensity the various components of the operation and the disasters that befall them."

","For me the only selling point for this movie was Bill Goldman's screenplay. Although I have seen several films in which he acted plus a couple he directed I've never been particularly enamoured of Dickie -all-I-want-is-a-knighthood Attenborough and 'names' like Olivier in cameo roles are more likely to turn me off than on. Nevertheless, having bought the DVD at a giveaway price on the strength of Goldman's name I watched it without being bored, relishing to occasional Goldmanism and more or less absorbing a piece of history. Essentially it could be described as a monumental cock-up in which several factors conspired to defeat a plan that was itself half-cocked. Despite being a tad overlong it is, on the whole, watchable."

","As genres go, the war movie went through a fairly slow and awkward evolution. During the 40s and 50s, when all the other genres were busy growing up, all war pictures were produced as propaganda or respectful tribute, simply due to the needs of the era. By the 60s and 70s the genre was making up for lost time with not only anti-war movies but also war comedies and even war musicals. A Bridge Too Far turns away from such frivolity, back to those earlier pictures that recorded events of the past conflict, but this time around it is to tell one of the less successful stories of the Allies in World War Two.<br/><br/>Many war stories have been told through the eyes of one or two characters, with shifting historical episodes taking place as a backdrop. Screenwriter William Goldman's takes the reverse approach. His script is first and foremost a description of events, from which various personal stories are thrown up. And charting as it does a full scale military operation, A Bridge Too Far features numerous characters and numerous tiny stories. With such fleeting glimpses it is difficult to make much empathetic connection to the material. And yet the whole thing is structured to provide a blend of the informative, the exciting and the moving. Some characters exist purely for historical detail, others are heroes of a brief action set-piece, while others still are mouthpieces for a bit of commentary.<br/><br/>Director Richard Attenborough was proving himself to be a specialist in war and historical pictures, and you can see him here perfecting the broader sweep that would soon win him an Oscar for Gandhi. He shows real economic expression, often putting an individual story in the foreground and a bigger happening in the background. His arrangements are clear and meaningful, which also helps in the fast paced action scenes. We get a real impression of the speed at which combat takes place, with enemies popping up and people being shot with barely enough time for us to process them. The editing of Antony Gibbs is instrumental here, never allowing a shot to carry on for an instant longer than it needs to. Still, Attenborough uses far too many close-ups for the needs of the picture, at times making them standard shots when they ought to be played like trump-cards for key moments. He also wastes time with banal bits of metaphorical business, like the train-set spinning round in circles.<br/><br/>As usual with an Attenborough picture we get the full range of Dickie's acting buddies, and this is perhaps his most impressive ensemble yet. Unfortunately what with all the bit playing going on here many of them are simply filling a slot – the cool arrogance of one upper-class general, the gung-ho naiveté another, the nervousness of some junior officer – at least, that goes for the British cast members. The Americans are a more interesting bunch; James Caan and Robert Redford giving believably impassioned but unfortunately brief performances. The standout is Gene Hackman as Polish general Sosabowski, who brilliantly conveys through his suppressed anger at the incompetence of his allies, the fact that, as representative of a conquered nation his perspective on the combat is somewhat more realistic. Ryan O'Neal also stands out but for all the wrong reasons. It suddenly struck me watching his dreadful turn in A Bridge Too Far how much O'Neal resembles George W. Bush – he has the same deadpan delivery and gormless expression.<br/><br/>However A Bridge Too Far is too major an epic to allow these minor gripes to spoil it. This is where the picture's bitty structure and legion of characters comes in useful. Don't like this actor? Never mind, he only has two scenes. And in spite of its lack of a overarching personal story to bind the narrative together, A Bridge Too Far does do a very decent job of telling the big historical story. It's almost as effective as a documentary, and is certainly more entertaining. There are many pictures that ought to have been successful, but somehow failed. A Bridge Too Far ought to have been a failure, but is somehow a success."

","Here, I won't write about the starry cast or the plot, elements that can be found aplenty in other posts and summaries.<br/><br/>This is a magnificent war movie, noticeably for its impeccable camera work and no-gimmick, genuine war vehicles and tech. All in splendid colours in the original part of the world it took place in.<br/><br/>This is also a film with surprisingly little bias; Germans, Brits, Yankee and Polish soldiers' POV is shown, as well as these of the Dutch citizen, resistance or not. The film begins with an over-dramatized recap told by one of the last character seen in the film, a civilian woman caught in the war. Civilians, usually scarce in these kind of movies, are taking their rightful place here.<br/><br/>However, where the movie is not as successful IMO, is in its painful, elaborate way of hammering on the point; Typically, somebody says something and the very next thing you see on the screen is exactly what that characters said happening, accompanied by an obvious musical score.<br/><br/>The music, while I'm at it, would have been quite alright if piped with a little more subtlety, but it is all over the place, loud and proud, and on this point is in the style of the film itself; over-produced. No need to be WWII expert to predict the outcome of the movie 10 minutes after it began, for the not-too-subtle hints that are given with liberality here and there.<br/><br/>Because that's the real problem of the movie; It is big, ambitious and ponderous, the beat being much too slow and heavy for the sake of inserting all of these starry cameos and to prove how serious it has been researched. Hackman's accent is also terrible, BTW.<br/><br/>However, it is an unusual little gem of the genre, the last real large-scale war movie before the CGI era, and one about an allied defeat to boot. The film sure would have benefited from a sharper, more focused POV, but the makers wanted it universal, and universality itself isn't without some good aspects, sometimes.<br/><br/>All in all, a movie that is head and shoulders above the average for this genre. Well worth the lengthy time it takes, IMO."

","In the tradition of other documentary style war dramas e.g. ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"", ""Battle of the Bulge"" and ""The Longest Day"", to name a few, ""A Bridge Too Far"" documents an ill-conceived mission designed to end the war earlier that failed miserably. Operation Market Garden was designed by Field Marshal Montgomery and many warnings and messages from various allies in occupied Holland were ignored causing many casualties to the military and Dutch citizenry. Like all these films it has a star studded cast of Brits, Americans and Germans including Sean Connery, Michael Caine, Edward Fox, Dirk Bogarde, Anthony Hopkins, Gene Hackman, Ryan O'Neal, Elliott Gould, James Caan, Robert Redford, Hardy Kruger, Maxmillian Schell and Liv Ullman as well as many recognizable character actors. The film is loaded with many very memorable scenes and terrific acting. It is beautifully filmed by Geoffrey Unsworth with an intelligent script by William Goldman and Cornelius Ryan who wrote the book. The music score by John Addison is brilliant and the main theme has become a standard for military bands. I saw this when it came out in 1977 and was quite impressed. Since then I have seen it multiple times on TV and have bought the DVD and now the Blu-Ray version which is incredibly beautiful. This is one not to miss."
"Poseidon-3","Null","0","1","22 April 2009"," A movie too long, but, at times, an impressive one.
","The 60s and 70s yielded quite a few all-star WWII epics and this is one of the better ones. The list of names is a very impressive one, especially when one considers the year in which this was made. The film concerns the disastrous British operation Market Garden, in which troops were to be parachuted into various locales near key bridges and then supported by ground forces to arrive shortly thereafter. Unfortunately, thanks to weather conditions, a few surprises from the enemy and other unwise decisions, the operation was not wholly successful and many lives were lost. A large collection of major actors appear in various parts based on real life participants, frequently using the actual names of the men. It's a long, detailed account of the mission, perhaps a little too involved and chock full for its own good at times, but there are memorable vignettes throughout. Hopkins plays a Lieutenant Colonel trapped with his men in a house that is eventually almost leveled by shellfire. The destruction of the town he's trying to liberate is very vividly depicted. Caan has one of the most unforgettable scenes as a Staff Sergeant determined to keep a promise to Campbell, one of his men. Some of the casting is questionable and will satisfy or disappoint according to taste. Gould, for example, is not believable at all in his role as a Colonel and Redford, though his sequence is decent, comes off as rather ridiculous in his raft-rowing moments. Hackman's entrance into the film is clever and is deftly handled by director Attenborough, but his accent is almost distractingly bad. Bogarde is good as the rather pompous man in charge of everything and Caine and Connery are dependably solid. It's refreshing to know that Ullmann's character, a wife and mother who opens her home to wounded soldiers, was a real life person and not someone just shoehorned into the film to provide a feminine presence. Generally, though some facts and scenarios were altered in order to work in the film, the movie keeps the story true to what happened. One case in which this backfired was the casting of youthful O'Neal as a Brigadier General, who really was the age of his real life counterpart, but who was derided by the public and critics for being all wrong. (Truth is, O'Neal, himself, perhaps, wasn't the right actor for the role, age aside.) Filled with plenty of action, gunplay, bombings, blood and a certain degree of gore, it's not necessarily an uplifting film since it demonstrates the futility that exists in warfare and more so the incredible waste, destruction and death in it."

","Many of the commenter's posts about, 'A Bridge Too Far' hits the marks about the above average attention of this films attention to historical accuracy, and for that I give it kudos. The use of subtitles with Germans and Dutch speaking their native tongues is another plus as well. <br/><br/>One point well taken by another poster is this film condensed Two SS division commanders who fought in the actual battle into one fictional character. A small amount of this type of creative license is acceptable if it does not sacrifice historical accuracy as egregiously as U- 571 depicting Americans as the first to capture an Enigma machine when it was the British that were the first to capture this device from a U-Boat. All in all ABTF kept historical facts pretty well on the mark but by no means perfect. The movie depicted the Polish paratroopers being shot at in the sky at their drop zone which is inaccurate, they were warned off in time when amazingly one of British Airbornes radios were working to warn off the drop which was changed to another spot. There are other inaccuracies but the filmmakers certainly had integrity in the historical depiction of Market Garden, not perfect, but it's by no stretch of the means a U-571 which is a churlish movie.<br/><br/>I think the film would have been served better by using unknowns for the major characters. The battle scenes could have been made more clearer as to just where they were taking place without having to resort to 'take note audience' type dialog by the principals for audiences unfamiliar with the historical facts about the battle, but of course, if not deftly done, this can make a film of this nature very ponderous; keeping the narrative flowing while giving a sense just where in the three cities (Eindhoven, Nijmegan & Arhnem) the action is taking place is difficult.<br/><br/>My biggest gripe about this film is John Addison's musical score which sounds like the music from Alvin & the Chipmunks. I really thought the score was a major minus to the film. It sounded as if Addison was doing a weak imitation of the major fanfare from 'The Longest Day' by Maurice Jarre. <br/><br/>With all the money spent on this film, it was crying out for a Jerry Goldsmith score or at the very least Ron Goodwin who scored many WW-II pictures such as, 'Battle of Britain (1969)', 'Where Eagles Dare', '633 Squadron' & many others. I would be so bold as to say the score was incompetent. It lacked any kind of emotional depth and did not convey the proper emotive qualities for the various stages of the film. A very one-dimensional score by John Addison.<br/><br/>A very exemplary film with great pains to get original military hardware or fabricate facsimiles of equipment not available. Loved it when they showed the Bailey bridge being thrown up and the collapsible boats the Americans used to ford the river at Nijmegan."

","From BAFTA nominated director Lord Sir Richard Attenborough (Gandhi, Cry Freedom), this may not the best war film I've seen, but certainly worth watching. Set near the end of the Second World War, the Germans have lost most of France, and allied forces decide to hit them a final time, this is operation Market Garden. This film follows the armies of Britain, America and Poland as they attempt to capture three bridges behind enemy lines in complicated parachute and armoured assault, most important bridge being Arnhem. But the combination of poor allied intelligence and two crack German tank divisions meant the final part of the operation was doomed to failure. With an all-star cast, in alphabetical: The Blue Lamp's Sir Dirk Bogarde as Lt. Gen. Frederick A.M. Browning, young James Caan as SSgt. Eddie Dohun, Sir Michael Caine as Lt. Col. John O.E. Vandeleur, Sir Sean Connery as Maj. Gen. Robert E. Urquhart, BAFTA winning Edward Fox as Lt. Gen. Brian G. Horrocks, Elliott Gould as Col. Robert Stout, Gene Hackman as Maj. Gen. Stanislaw F. Sosabowski (putting on a ridiculous Polish accent, it's worse than Dick Van Dyke's cockney), Sir Anthony Hopkins as Lt. Col. John D. Frost, Hardy Krüger as Maj. Gen. Ludwig, Barry Lyndon's Ryan O'Neal as Brig. Gen. James M. Gavin, Lord Sir Laurence Olivier as Dr. Jan Spaander, Robert Redford as Maj. Julian Cook, Deep Impact's Maximilian Schell as Lt. Gen.

","While this film isn't a standard war movie with a definitive start and finish, (it's more a series of small vignettes, with the greater plot as a backdrop) this is quite a satisfying film. The overall plot is one of Stranded British troops holding off German forces at a Bridge along the Arnhem river in Holland (the Netherlands if you prefer). The story is a telling of an actual Allied campaign known as Market Garden, where the Allies would drop thousands of paratroopers behind enemy lines at several key bridges, with the anticipation that reinforces troops would soon come to their aid. It was a total disaster fraught with conflict between English and American commanders, and a total lack of coordination of proper supply. There are so many outstanding performances here, and there are a bevy of iconoclastic actors. Gene Hackman, James Caan, Sean Connery, Michael Caine, Elliot Gould, Lawrence Olivier, Robert Redford, Max Schell, Anthony Hopkins, and the list goes on. An eclectic roster of Hollywood's who's who, and they all give sparkling performances. Each is given their own vignette, highlighting the different terrible aspects of the campaign, but not all tying together like other films. There's the slaughter of the Polish paratroops, the overstressed MASH units, the understaffed British troops in Arnhem, etc. Each really highlights a different aspect of the campaign, instead of focusing on one main theme, or highlighting a specific aspect of the campaign, like a specific company, but all in all, the wonderful performances more than make up for this flaw."

Maybe it's because I'm of a younger generation than the filmmakers that some scenes seem a bit old-fashioned and almost melodramatic. The movie is good, but I think it could have been much better if some scenes were emotionally stronger and some melodramatic scenes were cut out. It is also annoying when the woman in the prologue says that the war is still going Hitlers way in 1944. You wouldn't expect such a comment in an otherwise so accurate movie.

","War films should never be confused with history, no matter what their pedigree. A Bridge too Far is based on the book of the same name, by Cornelius Ryan. The book is a serious, and accurate work of fact, the film much less so. It is not possible to condense a battle, which lasted many days, into a couple of hours. However some omissions are unforgivable. <br/><br/>For example. In the film General Horrocks briefing gives the impression that XXX Corps alone is involved in the ground attack. This of course is not so. V111 and X11 Corps advance on XXX Corps flanks, in fact the whole of the British 2nd Army is involved. This leads to the worst omission of the film. The commander of the 2nd British Army, the man who was in overall command of Operation Market Garden, is not represented in the film, and I think not even named. This insult is compounded by the fact that General Patton is mentioned twice, even though he was not involved. If you are reading this, and you have seen the film, but you do not know who I am referring too, shame on you, you need to read more.<br/><br/>The scene towards the end of the film, when Generals Gavin,Horrocks, and Browning discuss whether to keep trying, lacks the presence of the General who made the decision Who was that man?

Ludwig seemed morose but that was hardly his fault as he had few speaking parts. I don't know what it is about his face but he doesn't strike me as German. He looks more like an American baseball player. By the way, for those who are confused why Maj. Gen. Ludwig (Hardy Kruger)took orders from Lt. Gen. Bittrich (Maximillian Schell), it must be explained that within the rank of generals, a lieutenant outranks a major. <br/><br/>Gene Hackman was terrible with that unlikely Polish accent. Ryan O'Neal, Robert Redford and Eliot Gould were so-so, ho-hum. Dirk Bogarde as a British martinet and ""Col. Blimp"" was a lot of fun but the role did not really fit his handsome looks. We must thank Sir Laurence Olivier for deigning to take the role of what could only be called an ""extra.""

Bittrich : No authentic looking Tiger and the later model Panther tanks. <br/><br/>What I liked most was the musical theme composed and conducted by John Addison who was a veteran of Market Garden having been a soldier with the XXX Corps (British) under Gen.

I've made it a point to watch ABTF every few years from then on, and wow, it's a damn fine flick, isn't it?<br/><br/>It was a series of firsts for me, I can't speak for anybody else:<br/><br/> For the first time, we don't get the soldier clutching a bloodless wound and dying a quick, tidy, glorified, recruitment office approved, old Hollywood death.<br/><br/> For the first time, we get insight into the interminable waiting by civilians like you and me, followed by a blinding ray of hope, followed by indescribable horrors.<br/><br/> For the first time, we get a sense of the hellish logistical maze that major military operations must work out, compromising itself and the lives of thousands of men, because of an appalling lack of vision by some petty official (""We'll land you 10 miles out of town, since we cannot afford to loose a single glider"").<br/><br/> For the first time, we see how the little details can do the biggest operations in (""It seems, sir, that the radios have been supplied with the wrong crystals"").<br/><br/> For the first time, we see the astounding stupidity of mankind (that's the race I belong to, I'm sometimes ashamed to say) taking the form of Volksgrenadier boy soldiers.<br/><br/> And  the paratrooping sequence.  The artillery shells coming closer and closer.  The construction of the Bailey bridge.<br/><br/>Any weak elements of the film are overwhelmed by sequences such as these.<br/><br/> Furthermore, it is to Cornelius Ryan's gigantic credit that he shows, in both TLD and ABTF, german officials as genuinely human, as opposed to caricatures.  Spielberg STILL succumbs to this childlish temptation.<br/><br/> Just a couple of thoughts:<br/><br/>1.  Gen. Gavin (Ryan O'Neal) is not necessarily too young to be a General. During wartime, the size of an army balloons, red tape shrinks to a minimum, and gifted leaders can quickly achieve extremely high rank.  Accordingly, once war operations come to an end and the size of an army deflates, to compensate, many high ranking officials are demoted back to their pre-war rank.<br/><br/> 2.  Somebody mentioned something about americans arriving at the end of WWI, therefore not having lived the full, debilitating horrors of trench warfare, as Montgomery did.  Fiddlesticks.  It was americans who invented trench warfare during the Civil War.  If european generals had bothered to study the american military experience, WWI would have ended much sooner. What the american army did in 1917, when on the offensive for the first time, was attack in ZIG-ZAG with many flexible units, instead of full frontal assaults right at pillboxes with machine guns.  Thus, american tactics quickly sent dumbfounded germans reeling into defeat.<br/><br/> Some films have to be three hours long, and this is one of them.  Any way you look at it, ATF is a thrilling, horrifying, thought- provoking, all around excellent film.   A grand slam.<br/><br/> Now where's the definitive Russian Front epic, the life and times of Andrei Zhukov, Grand Marshall of the Soviet Union? Now THERE'S an epic, Leningrad, Moscow, Stalingrad and Berlin, clocking in at just under four hours, whaddya say?"

","""A Bridge Too Far"" is one of the relatively few war ""epics"" which makes a genuine attempt to get the facts right. Criticism of the movie doesn't take into account how difficult it is to maintain the kind of dramatic tension you get in fiction when you are dealing with reality.<br/><br/>There are a few scenes in this movie which make it special to the war movie buff. The limitations of not having the right equipment will always be there when you are trying to depict the largest military conflict in history, but there are some really great moments. The Spitfire that flies low over a young Dutch boy on a bicycle and ""waggles"" its wings captures the hope that must have filled the people suffering under German occupation that liberation was coming. The rear echelon bumbling that sends the largest paratroop force in history into battle with radios that don't work really sums up so much about military history and the reasons why things go wrong in war.<br/><br/>The sound effects of a German anti-tank unit first withstanding a rolling barrage and then recovering to counterattack a long line of Allied tanks are the most realistic I have heard in a war movie.<br/><br/>The restaging of an apparently suicidal river crossing in rickety ""collapsible"" English boats captures the real heroism that was a part of the experience of so many men in that war, and the drama of the scene, while heightened by the presence of Robert Redford, does not depend on him being in the scene to make it riveting.<br/><br/>The depiction of British paratroops fighting for days to hold the ""bridge too far"" that gives the movie its name is amongst the most realistic depictions of warfare you will see. It might be difficult to believe when you see it, but the fighting at Arnhem has been recorded in minute detail and doing some research shows you the movie is spot on.<br/><br/>The attention to detail is fascinating in small ways. This is about the only movie in which you will see British troops using the ""PIAT"" - the Personal Infantry Anti Tank weapon that looks like something out of a Roadrunner cartoon - but it was real (and really hopeless when you compare it to the American bazooka and the German Panzerfaust).<br/><br/>The movie is not entirely accurate, and the fact that there is no happy ending makes it an unlikely story to be made into an epic, but the film immortalises the largest parachute drop in history, and war movie buffs have to be thankful that it was made, despite considerations of history and the antiwar sentiment that made it a failure at the box office."

","Probably as a result of the Vietnam years, an era was coming to an end.  The days of the big budget Hollywood epic that focused on historical events were giving way to more personal anti-war movies.  Like The Longest Day and Tora Tora Tora, A Bridge Too Far is a mostly true account of one of World War II's major battles.  By late 1944, the outcome of the war was not in question, but the way it would be achieved and at what cost still were. Hence, the Allies tried to make a quick push that would break the German Army.  Their plan was to seize a major road over several rivers, but as history proved, the plan went ""a bridge too far"".<br/><br/>That said, this movie is very well-made.  It has good production values and seems fairly accurate (very accurate for Hollywood).  The all-star ensemble cast is very good with standout performances by Anthony Hopkins as the trapped British commander and James Caan as a American sergeant who won't go back on his word.  The cast is rounded out by Dirk Bogarde and Edward Fox (the architects of the operation), Hardy Kruger and Maximillian Schell (German generals), Sean Connery and Michael Caine as a British general, Laurence Olivier as a doctor, Liv Ullman as a Dutch civilian, Gene Hackman as the leader of the Polish brigade, and Elliot Gould, Robert Redford, and Ryan O'Neal as American officers.<br/><br/>The movie has some very suspenseful moments but its ability to compel wavers at times.  The movie is also just a little overlong.  Some viewers may have a hard time looking past the stars and getting more involved in the plot. Overall, these minor flaws don't detract from the film which is definitely worth seeing, especially for World War II buffs.<br/><br/>*** out of ****"

","When I first saw this, in the summer of 1977, it was the Greatest War Picture of All Time -- except for Patton, of course, which isn't even in the same class.  It is grotesquely dated now, although I think it's all the fault of the music.<br/><br/>Ironically, I own the soundtrack on LP and was a big fan of it at the time -- perhaps that's why I'm so sensitive to it now.  But today it strikes me as bombastic, and a throwback to the kind of music you'd find in a 40's WW2 extravaganza.<br/><br/>Disregarding the music, it's a good film.  The explosions, as was the style until Saving Private Ryan, are way too flashy -- bright orange blossoms of pyrotechnic orgasm punctuate every battle scene.  Aside from those and the music, a fine fine film.<br/><br/>It's a faithful version of Cornelius Ryan's epic account of Operation Market-Garden and the Battle of Arnhem, directed with gusto and honesty by Richard Attenborough, whom I believe is a veteran of the battle.  The casting is brilliant, except maybe for Ryan O'Neal, who plays the boyish Jim Gavin, well, *too* boyishly.  (O'Neal was 37 during filming, and Gavin was the same age during the battle, but Gavin had two years of battle-hardening under his belt -- his boyishness was relative to older soldiers, not to Hollywood stars!)<br/><br/>And aside from the clunky repro German tanks, and the over-obvious use of roll bars on the Kubelwagens, the machinery assembled has rarely been exceeded.  Look at all those Shermans!  See the beautiful C-47s! (Even though it's fairly obvious not that many of them were airworthy, after repeated viewings.)  Watch the Dutch Air Force parachute into their own country, standing in for the British 1st Airborne Division, its Polish contingent, and the American 101st and 82nd Airbornes!  Technically, everything looks great.<br/><br/>But the jarring music takes away the versimilitude on a regular basis. Turn it down!<br/><br/>Maybe a Special Edition DVD could be produced, separating the music and offering a version sans music, in addition to the 5.1 vs. 2.0 soundtracks... or maybe just a version with the damn music a little quieter.<br/><br/>

The studios no doubt believe (with justification) that there's more money to be made making movies of ""our boys"" bravely blowing the enemy off the map.

Although this is a rousing helter-skelter action epic with the massive operation portrayed in a suitably massive way, there is a heavy anti-war undertone.It successfully portrays the vast waste of human life invvoled and offers no happy ending to justify the suffering.Few directors could handle such a film with the deftness and compassion that Attenbourough applies.His action scenes are breathtaking,while the casualty sequences are genuinely heart-rending. The cast is amazing,drawing together the top acting talent from Britain and the USA.Particularly strong performances include  Anthony Hopkins',Sean Connery &  Edward Fox as three of the British cammanders most closely caught up in the fighting.A degree of comic-relief is provided by the superb Elliot Gould who's brief appearance includes one of the film's most memorable moments.Michael Caine is laconic,Lawrence Olivier and Liv Ullman are compassion personified,Ryan O'Neal is intense and harassed and Gene Hackman gives one of his best perfomances of all time as a Polish General with grave misgivings about the whole thing. Dirk Bogard, as overall commander Gen.Browning is given the uncomfortable task of bringing humanity to the man who the film blames largely for the operations massive casualty count and he hits the right mark every time.

","I've read a lot of the reviews for this movie, and most merely discuss the film's accuracy, or the reviewer's own personal opinion of the real life characters portrayed in the film. Because this film focuses so much on accurately portraying Operation Market Garden, you lose the feel of suspense that one gets from most war films. The film makes up for it with beautiful cinematography, and amazing score, and . Unfortunately, the editing could not save the film's fairly disjointed plot outline. This movie skips around a lot, so you have to pay close attention to the setting of each scene. Some scenes which should have been important were hurredly placed into the movie, or so it would seem, and lose a lot of their effect. They also stick out like a sore thumb towards the end of the movie, where Attenborough seems to try to tie up countless loose ends in a half hour. For some,  the ending may be unsatisfying, but I after a second viewing I realized how much I liked it. There are a lot of characters to keep track of as well. Luckily, with the all-star cast of ""A Bridge Too Far,"" it's fairly easy to remember which lead is which. All of their performances are excellent, with the exception of a rather overdrawn Ryan O'Neale. If you can sit through another war movie, I would put this one at the top of your list to see."

My point is that, as confirmed by the excellent History Channel's ""History vs. Hollywood"" review of this movie, the legendary producer Joseph E. Levine spared no expense to create this movie as an accurate depiction of historic events.  When combined with superb script, cast and director, ""A Bridge Too Far"" achieves what other great WW II epic movies do not - adherence to real people, action and factual honesty.

The Sherman tanks really look good; the uniforms, the hairstyles, the language - everything combines to create a ""real"" depiction of 1944.<br/><br/>The events depicted are all true. For example, the words used by Horrocks (Edward Fox) during the pre battle briefing are based on reality. Even the leather jerkin and woolly jersey he wears are exactly as in reality. His accent is spot on, too - see ""World at War"" to see the real Horrocks being interviewed.<br/><br/>There is the perennial problem of the German tanks. No modern war film has depicted German tanks accurately (except Saving Private Ryan). This is simply because they are all in museums. Sherman tanks are relatively cheap to hire.<br/><br/>There is the indefineable feeling that one really is watching the original operation. In one scene, a US paratrooper drives a jeep across a field. As he drives, we see the remains of a battle that wasn't even filmed. All the camera shows us is the *remains* of the battle. And it really works.<br/><br/>The acting is very good. I mentioned Horrocks before, played by Fox. Other performances of note include Anthony Hopkins as a believeable John Frost; James Caan also plays in one memorable scene.<br/><br/>But nonetheless, the truthful moviewatcher cannot help but admit that this film has flaws. Firstly, the film was based on the nonfiction book by Cornelius Ryan. This means that the film has to make its own drama, its own structure. This doesn't quite work. Some bits, esp. towards the end, stick out. Like the fate of the polish brigade, which is almost depicted off-hand. As a whole, from the literary perspective, the film is not exactly brilliant. In fact, someone who knows nothing about the war might get a trifle bored towards the end. No clear resolution, no great victory.<br/><br/>But that is not to dissuade the potential viewer. If you like war films with lots of realism, explosions, and some very fine acting, see this film."

It couldn't have been easy to deal with all these egos. It's accurate, as far as I understand it, and the actors are given solid scripts. Particular standouts, not surprisingly, are Anthony Hopkins and Gene Hackman. The latter as a Polish General is very well done. And Hopkins is at his best here. The weariness of his character is well done. He seems to be a typical English prig--stuck in a totally bizarre, brutal situation, with very competent German soldiers trying to kill him. And his amusement at wearing forest camouflage in the middle of a city, after they've moved into it, is a nice moment. <br/><br/>There are some who hate war movies because it seems to glorify the killing. Yes, there's some of that--but we would likely have stopped having wars a long time ago if somebody didn't believe it was worth killing to get what he wanted. We can all be as sanctimonious as we want, but war happens. And it's a momentous occurrence, worth making a movie about. <br/><br/>IF there's a flaw here, i'd probably say it was the Caan role, he does the best he can, and it's well filmed, it's just not that interesting. It takes up time, and though I think the movie is not over long, there are other things I'd rather be seeing. <br/><br/>Overall, take it in, ignore the critical comments, I remember when it came out, not a great time for war movies--the late seventies were a pretty dismal time.

","This is a sombre, bloody, and lavish account of the failed Market Garden operation by the Allies. It details how things fell apart for the Allies despite significant planning and commitment. The dramatic, epic unravelling of this great attempt to secure the North in hopes of establishing a port for communications will probably be lost on some people (eg. the Maltin review) as it tells the story from the point of view of the various nationalities involved, perhaps confusing less attentive or interested viewers.<br/><br/>The movie differs from ""The Longest Day"", for example, by being very bloody, and pointedly shows the Allies taking it on the chin. The ugly reality of defeat is on display in this very un-Hollywood movie. The sense of fear from the soldiers - including generals - is communicated, which is wasn't nearly as well in ""The Longest Day"". These are clearly individuals, not just the generic movie GIs.<br/><br/>Look for all the subtle Attenborough touches in this movie: eg. the faint ""help me, help me"" of a dying soldier forgotten on the rivers edge in a nearly motionless and soundless scene, an immediate counterpoint to the frenentic depiction of Robert Redford's ""Hail Mary"" river crossing. Or the shovels of dirt, containing spent bullet cartridges, being used to bury a soldier. This is a movie with gritty real-world texture, and a great ode to the suffering of the brave fighting men who took part."
"escoles","8","0","1","22 August 2000"," Answer: Yes.
","Michael Coy's comments are comprehensive and hard to augment, but I feel compelled to answer: Yes, it was worth it. _Longest Day_ closed glorying war, and in large part glossing over the carnage wrought on D-Day.<br/><br/>
_A Bridge Too Far_ serves the important purpose of bringing Cornelius Ryan's continual focus on the human cost back into the frame. It has the single-director's focus that the earlier film lacked, and applies a new standard that reaches beyond movie-star to get more natural, more real performances. <br/><br/>All that remains is a completion to Ryan's ""war trilogy"" by filming _The Last Battle_, covering the brutalities and ambiguities of the conquest of Berlin. But with its moral ambiguities (I'm reminded of the Russian commander who urges  nuns in a hospital to make themselves scarce, because 'the men following mine are not so disciplined') would be difficult to pass by the script doctors in this falsely moralistic age."

","A movie that depicts one of the worse military blunders in World War II. All the battle scenes reflect the horrors of war at its best.  Dirk Bogard and Sean Connery make a breakthrough performance.  Definetely a must-see war film.  Hell, it has a better story line than Saving Private Ryan"
"toopier","10","0","1","27 June 2000"," twice as good as ""the longest day""
","One of the best WWII movies made after 1960. Realistic in that the ""good guys"" don't always win, and the bad guys aren't always demons. I believe that this story, however, was stolen from another book...""The Cauldron"" written by British author Zeno in 1966."
"JAM-31","Null","0","1","18 April 2000"," Impressive Late 70's All-Star-Cast Epic
","Whether or not this is your type of film, you have to admit that the spectacle is very impressive.<br/><br/>The airdrop sequence (photographed long before CGI) is an awesome sight.  So are the battle scenes.  The movie is told in the style of the day, of an all-star-cast war epic.  The battle scenes are huge, bloody, and explosive, but they don't cause fear and put you right at the center of the battle the way that, for example, ""Saving Private Ryan"" did.<br/><br/>I liked all the performances, and most of the casting choices were dead on (Connery and Hopkins, for example, but excluding Max Schell, who did well with the part, but I believe the real Bittrich was bald.)  I also really liked the performances of Michael Caine, Elliot Gould, and Ryan O'Neal.<br/><br/>The score of the film is great.  Typical historic license is taken for some parts of the movie (The British, not the US under Major Cook, captured that bridge), but as a whole it seriously lets you understand the tragedy of Operation Market-Garden.  I recommend this highly to any fan of the genre."
"hgallon","Null","0","1","7 February 2000"," Nine point nine, recurring
","Previous comments have praised this epic's scale, accuracy, the intensity of its action sequences, etc. My own score would be nine point nine recurring out of ten. The remaining vanishingly small fraction of dissatisfaction is accounted for by one or two little niggles...<br/><br/>The gliders. We see them loading, taxiing, taking off, and scattered in profusion around the landing zones. But we see them flying only by the courtesy of special effects, and we don't see them land. This would be a shot on a par with those taken from the aircraft and the paratroopers' perspectives during the the jump sequences. It would also highlight just how important these gliders were to the airborne formations.<br/><br/>The maps. On the big screen, they are shown in briefings and planning meetings and they very effectively convey even to a non-military viewer the plans and progress of the operation. When the film is transferred to video, either they become so small that the vital details are lost in the blur, or they are cropped out of shot.<br/><br/>The jibe about ""bringing the boys home for Christmas"". Dickie Attenborough let his pacifist views show through here, but missed the point. ""Market Garden"" was not comparable to the blinkered strategy of World War I blimpish generals. It was a gamble, true, but a justifiable one. What is Attenborough saying ? Don't risk anything, pick on someone smaller, like Saddam Hussein ?<br/><br/>Studious viewers might like to read ""Slaughter over Sicily"" by Charles Whiting, for the tale of another airborne operation which went wrong. Perhaps this is another subject waiting for a film ..."

","this is the second best war film i've ever seen. It was the best until i saw ""Saving Private Ryan."""
"irgwonder","Null","0","1","17 December 1999"," One of the most historically accurate movies I've ever seen
","This movie is one of my favorites. After reading Corneilus Ryan's book, I realized how accurate this movie actually is. Why the critics didn't like it, I don't know so don't ask. The one complaint that other reviewers had was that it was too long. I can sympathize with them, if not agree with them. I personally think this movie was just right. It captures the scale of a battle that had twice as many casualties as D-Day, a favorite subject for movies.<br/><br/>A Bridge Too Far is wonderfully filmed. The scene where the camera takes on the perspective of a soldier jumping out of his C-47 transport plane is a very impressive shot, as are most of the combat scenes (I won't say which ones in order not to spoil it). The equipment, like the real-life Sherman tanks as opposed to the Korean-war vintage tanks too commonly used in WW2 movies, is as historically accurate as the events. A note on Ryan O'Neal. His character, General James ""Jumppin' Jim"" Gavin, was the youngest general in WW2 at the age of 38 and looked young at that. He wasn't 51 or 52-years old like he's portrayed in ""The Longest Day"" as noted by another reviewer.<br/><br/>I personally prefer ""A Bridge Too Far"" to ""The Longest Day"". I think ""A Bridge Too Far"" is so appealing to me because there's been who-knows-how-many movies made about D-Day while this is the only one about ""Market-Garden"". While it uses the same principles as ""The Longest Day"", I think it uses those principles better from a historic point of view. If you're seeing this just as an ordinary movie, this might seem like an incredibly long movie and I wouldn't suggest seeing it. However, if you like an historically accurate war movie, this is one of the best."
"Andresen","8","0","1","19 November 1999"," Gene Hackman AND Michael Caine in THE SAME FILM!
","There is a theory (proposed in Roger Ebert's Little Movie Handbook) that everywhere on earth, 24 hours a day, somewhere on cable is at least one movie featuring either Gene Hackman or Michael Caine.  Once I became familiar with the ""Hackman-Caine Principle"", I realized that not only is this probably true, but that ""Six Degrees of Gene Hackman"" is even easier to play than ""Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon"".  One day while milling around my video library, I realized that ""A Bridge Too Far"" had BOTH Hackman and Caine in it, and even though it probably isn't on cable much, I found some cosmic significance in that.  With the aid of the trusty IMDB search engine, I found out that this is the lone link in the Hackman/Caine matrix.<br/><br/>By the way, ""A Bridge Too Far"" is a very fine movie, especially if you're in the mood for a WWII epic (which I frequently am), although ""The Bridge at Remagen"" is a better WWII bridge flick.  ""A Bridge Too Far"" struggles to be a great epic, and has some wonderful moments, but falls a bit short. Overall, I'd give it a 6 or 7 out of 10, which is right where the IMDB voters have put it."
"BlueNote-3","Null","0","1","22 September 1999"," Thoroughly entertaining and interest raiser
","I have seen this movie many times. It is of course very entertaining. It also inspires one to further knowledge. That is partly due to Cornelius Ryan's story, but is also attributed to the fine pictorial detail in which it was crafted. The atmosphere in which the viewer is plunged is one of absolute realism. Watching the movie raised my interest in the history of that event, and I have since spent quite a bit of time reading all sorts of material on the subject, wanting to learn evermore. This effect from a movie is an undeniable sign of quality.<br/><br/>The casting is an extreme overkill. I believe that military engagement movies don't require all that talented actors. It is specially true in this film, it spanning such a large scale. Every actor here gives an average performance, as the scripts/direction yields an under-utilization of almost all caracters. What a waste!<br/><br/>I do have these specific comments though: Anthony Hopkins as Col. Frost is very credible and entertaining. Ryan O'Neal to me is simply a bad casting and I wish there would have been another actor in Gen. Gavin's role. Edward Fox's rendition of Gen. Horrocks is also quite enjoyable.<br/><br/>If the subject of war doesn't literally appall you, you're going to benefit from watching this movie. I also recommend multiple viewings, to anyone driven by details."
"slawalin","9","0","1","6 September 1999"," Give credit for realism
","The one thing that impressed me most about the movie was the realism in the equipment. For example, real Sherman tanks were used in the movie, which was quite unlike ""Patton"" or the horrible ""Battle of the Bulge"" which used post-war American tanks for the Germans AND the Americans! I appreciate it when filmmakers take the time to ensure realism. Too many filmmakers get lazy and don't take the time to make movies historically accurate. They call it ""creative license"", but I call it sheer laziness."
"rhv_YS","Null","0","1","2 July 1999"," Better than what the critics say
","It's a mystery why the critics don't like this movie.  Leonard Maltin calls it lifeless and overproduced.  But I believe that this is Lord Richard Attenbourgh's best film.<br/><br/>Attenbourgh hides his displeasure of war here and tells the story of the 1944 attempt of the Allies to win WWII by dropping airborne troops into enemy-occupied Holland and sieze bridges until the main army arrives.  The plan is killed my Allied mistakes, like the fact that all the paratroopers supplies are dropped on ememy territory, and the late arrival of the Poles, who are the assist the British paratroopers and the fact that there was no major offensive to help push everybody along.<br/><br/>Unlike Attenbourgh's earlier attempt (the crazy ""Oh, What A Lovely War"")and later attempts (""In Love and War), his anti-war attitude is hidden and the camera is neutral, showing the Americans, British, Allied, Dutch and Nazis as people caught up in war and forced to try to save themselves.<br/><br/>The movie is based on a novel by Cornelius Ryan, who wrote ""The Longest Day.""  The movie has many similarities with ""The Longest Day.""  It's mainly about the men who fought the war than with the leaders and it centers on both sides.  It's also important to note that the Germans and Dutch speak their own languages, unlike ""Midway"" and like ""Longest Day"", ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" and ""Patton"", which makes it more documentary like.<br/><br/>This movie is helped by an all-star cast and can only be seen in its Panavision glory.  Please watch it in the widescreen edition either on Videocassette or DVD."
"bwaynef","Null","0","1","18 April 1999"," Sprawling and shapeless
","""A Bridge Too Far"" is a sprawling, shapeless epic with Ryan O' Neal looking desperately out of place as a General.  O' Neal, then in his late 30s but looking 10 years younger, plays the same person inhabited by then 51 or 52 year-old Robert Ryan in 1962's ""The Longest Day.""  The perpetually boyish O' Neal looks like he would be perfectly cast as Jimmy Olson in a Superman movie, not as a WWII General.  The film as a whole is a wearisome affair, just as the majority of critics claimed when it opened in June 1977, the summer of ""Star Wars.""  Perhaps ""Star Wars"" would have been a better title for this film since it is, in the tradition of ""The Longest Day,"" stuffed with the species.<br/><br/>But few of these ""stars"" have enough screen time to distinguish themselves. Chomping on a big fat cigar, Elliott Gould is a mere caricature of dozens of other dogfaces in dozens of other WWII movies.  As already noted, Ryan O' Neal, who probably has the most screen time of the American actors, is miscast, much too boyish to be believable as a General.  Robert Redford, perhaps the biggest marquee name at the time of the film's release, gets the star treatment, being introduced (in the last 45 minutes or so) with a closeup that seems to cry out, ""Hey kids, look who's here!""  Redford is there all right, but I found myself wishing that Richard Attenborough were not.  The actor turned director who, five years later, would lead ""Gandhi"" to an eight Oscar sweep, is out of his element in such a huge production. The intimacy of 1993's superb ""Shadowlands"" is more his style.  ""A Bridge Too Far"" never gains momentum, and John Addison's wimpy music score doesn't help at all."
"Sven-8","8","0","1","9 September 1998"," Very faithful to the book, which is a rarity.
