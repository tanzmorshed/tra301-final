","In bringing together elements from Inglourious Basterds, Ocean's Eleven and Museum Hours, George Clooney certainly had plenty of opportunity for a rich and interesting story. War heroes who appreciate fine art played by the likes of Clooney, Matt Damon, Bill Murray and John Goodman (plus a few ""that guy""s), attempting to steal back priceless works of art from the Nazis, it sounds amazing.<br/><br/>So what went wrong? Well, to begin with, for a movie about a team, we're given very little time with them as a group. Almost immediately they pair off on their own little adventures. Instead of using these exploits to let us know a little more about the characters as individuals, we get the usual oddball pairings and some mildly amusing, but ultimately hollow, vignettes. Even when we lose some of our team, it really feels like nothing more than just something that happened on the trip, like ""oh, and I also saw a horse."" We have hardly any sense of them as a group and far less about them as people. The only character whose motivations we can understand is the one played by Cate Blanchett, but her limited chemistry with Matt Damon dooms what little redemptive quality her character had.<br/><br/>Also, and particularly troubling for a movie involving art, George Clooney's lens has little reverence for the work it shows. Though the film heavy-handedly ponders whether a piece of art is worth a human life, the camera never does. Even when a character lays down his life for a sculpture, it comes off less dramatic than inevitable. The film treats the works as being mostly historically significant and never finds that lover's gaze that tells the audience why.<br/><br/>What we're left with is a bag of spare parts. It's a popcorn movie with no setpieces. A war movie with no battles. A heist movie with no scheming. An art movie with no inspiration. Were they to have found some of Inglourious Basterds' bluster, Ocean's Eleven smarts or Museum Hour's insight, they may have found a formula that works, but that's not the movie we have here. I'll be damned if George Clooney doesn't look good in a moustache, though."
"CanuckGirl","4","167","209","7 February 2014"," Danny Ocean stars in ""Saving Private Art""
","If you want to see George Clooney play George Clooney, Matt Damon play Matt Damon, Bill Murray play Bill Murray, John Goodman play John Goodman, and Jean Dujardin play a clichéd Frenchmen (right down to the French beret and scarf)...in a incredibly mediocre film based on a compelling true story that's badly written and directed, go see ""The Monuments Men"". It's an ""Oceans 11"" team of art curators, historians and architects sent into France and Germany. Their mission? ""Saving Private Art"". The obstacles? Almost none, once they knew where to look. It was apparently the easiest art heist in history. The plus side? it's a stretch...but I did like Hugh Bonneville playing someone kinder and gentler than Lord Grantham in ""Downton Abbey""...and Cate Blanchett? She's always great, but she truly doesn't have much to do here, other than speak with a French accent and look irritated. Don't be fooled by the star-studded cast like I was. This movie is a waste of your money and time. All of these actors have made far superior films. And this story would have been better served by a more accomplished screenwriter and director."
"mikerapuano","6","287","371","9 February 2014"," Not nearly the worst film of 2014, but the most disappointing one so far.
","The Monuments Men is directed by George Clooney, staring himself, Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Jean Dujardin, Bob Balaban, Hugh Bonneville, and Cate Blanchett. It tells of a group of soldiers tasked to locate and preserve pieces of art that have been stolen by the Nazis during World War II.<br/><br/>It's no secret that The Monuments Men was one of everyone's most anticipated movies of 2013, and looked like a solid awards contender, until it was pushed to a February release date, purportedly due to the need for more time to be spent on the special effects.<br/><br/>The truth is, The Monuments Men could be, and really should be much more entertaining than it is. The best part of the film, and at the same time, its major problem, is the script. There are seemingly continuous laughs coming from quick one liners and witty character interactions, which keeps the audience somewhat engaged, although with such bleak subject matter, it's debatable that a movie dealing with the eradication of an entire culture's achievements should be as lighthearted as it is. But the flaw with the script is that it seems like the first act eats up almost all of it's running time. It's as if the film is missing large portions of the actual plot to make room for massive amounts of unnecessary exposition. Secondly, the film's characters are stale and one dimensional at best. I invite anyone who sees the film to wait an hour after finishing the movie, and try to remember even three of the character's names or what their role in the mission was. There isn't a moment in the entire film where it isn't simply John Goodman or Bill Murray dressed as World War II soldiers and not fleshed out characters. Albeit all of the actors are exceedingly fun to watch, I assume that just watching all of these actors talk together at a press conference would be just about as entertaining.<br/><br/>The Monuments Men isn't even close to the worst movie of 2014 by a long shot, even though it is only February, but it's arguably the most disappointing film of the year as of yet. I take no pleasure in saying this, but it's noble intentions fell utterly short due to awful pacing, and forgettable characters. I haven't read the book, but I have to think that it must be much better constructed and does this fantastic real life story more justice."
"GodofGSXR1977","3","149","189","9 February 2014"," If Disney Made A World War II Film
","This film is definitely not terrible but missed a big opportunity at making something memorable. And needless to say it unfortunately has a lot of problems that do it (and its intriguing story) a huge disservice. Before listing the problems I will note its positives: The acting, cast, direction and visuals are all good. OK...<br/><br/>And now the problems:<br/><br/>1) The quips and zingers every few minutes: Is this a sit-com or a drama about Nazis stealing art? It was hard enough to believe any of these characters are allowed to simply meander around Europe without strict supervision but even less believable that these men snap out witty one- liners back and forth after every few minutes. And the problem is that these one-liners are often during times of implied danger or tension, which gets broken immediately with the comedy relief.<br/><br/>2) The musical score/tone is absolutely bizarre and out-of-place in many areas: When taking on a subject as serious as WW2, it's not a great idea to constantly have happy-go-lucky comedy relief music going on in the background. It really is tonally all over the place and is out of place when considering the message trying to be sent about the importance of human art/culture, etc. Half the time I was expecting either a Broadway musical dance-line to jump out and start kicking their legs in front of the screen or at least see the Rocketeer fly past a Nazi blimp.<br/><br/>3) The one dimensional characters. We learn very little about the actual personalities of the main characters so there is little to invest in, especially between the characters and their relationships. It's hard to feel bad for characters who you don't know and are acting really stupid in very dangerous circumstances. I also felt there were many scenes missing from the film because we never see the main characters even bond or have much meaningful dialog within the first hour of the film, and are expected to cry for characters we do not know and expected to care about relationships we have not established.<br/><br/>4) The villains (are even worse:) The bad guys (Nazis of course) might as well have been twirling around their mustaches and laughing maniacally. Are we to believe that even the ""bad guys"" in a real historical situation did not have other emotions besides crazy and evil? And as if if the Nazis were not bad enough villains, the writers needed to include a sub-plot with the big bad Russians, who although helped us beat the Nazis, are apparently evil for wanting to take art for themselves, I guess.<br/><br/>5) Missed opportunities: Many scenes have a lot of potential to lead up to something interesting, intense, or memorable. They never deliver in any way, however. Every single moment where there is action,drama, or a threat of danger/death, it is resolved with some type of comic relief or very random exposition designed to move to the next scene as quickly as possible. Very sad to say because every scene starts out with promise, then fails.<br/><br/>6) The heroes/the Title: Not even sure about the accuracy of this film: But if true, the heroes are not even the Monuments Men, but the ONE German-speaking member (hired on a fluke) who figured out where the art was being hidden and the same guy also finds hidden Nazi gold. It should have been named after this one character, the other members are idiots. Any man who steps out of a vehicle in war-torn France to offer a cigarette to a horse, deserves to be shot.<br/><br/>7) The WW2 tropes cliché festival: Yet again another movie showing the ""greatest hits"" of WW2, relying on its audience to be a bunch of stupid simpletons who only respond to iconic images or names they know from grade school text books. ""OH, OMAHA BEACH! OH, BATTLE OF THE BULGE! OH, SCOWLING Hitler! OH PICASSO! THIS ALL MEANS SOMETHING!"" .. No, it's time to stop going for the low hanging fruit and bring something unique.<br/><br/>8) ""If it weren't for us you'd be speaking German"" ... This is an actual line from the movie, directed at a French woman from an American soldier. The problem is that only a few scenes before we see a German Nazi soldier speaking English to that very French woman. So apparently she would have been speaking neither German or French, she'd be speaking English so that the English-speaking audience wouldn't have to read subtitles. Ridiculous jingoistic quips would work fine in a more clever WW2 film, but definitely not this one.<br/><br/>9) Last but not least: George Clooney as Danny Ocean/Prince Charming/Hero Astronaut:<br/><br/>I cannot take him seriously in a WW2 film when he does the whole ""I'm not just a pretty face"" smooth talking nonsense. In an Ocean's 11 film, yes. He's a good actor, why did he choose to play it like this AGAIN? It's annoying and takes us out of the movie, especially when trying to believe him as a humble hero who cares about art and not just how cool he is."
"napierslogs","5","209","275","8 February 2014"," Telling an historical story comedically and missing a level of entertainment
","""The Monuments Men"" is a group of men (in real life around 350, and in this film 7) who are tasked with saving the historically and culturally significant monuments, fine arts and archives during World War II. They have to find and return that which the French hid and the Germans were finding and stealing and then hiding. And the film decided to tell this story comedically.<br/><br/>The film took a really long time to get going as they wanted it to be about the men that took on this task. But they changed their names and I also couldn't tell you a single characteristic of any of them. The men were paired off so they each had their own region to investigate, but none of that was interesting. The worst part was giving James Granger (Matt Damon) and Claire Simon (Cate Blanchett, representing the real- life heroine Rose Valland) a love story. They did have a reason for such nonsense, or how about just sticking with how it actually happened.<br/><br/>George Clooney has said the film is about 80% accurate, and that seems fair enough. But the problem isn't the historical inaccuracy; the problem is that the cheap humour diminishes the very people and story they're trying to empower. The humour was just a handful of lines wanting to kill Hitler and standing on a landmine. It just didn't make the film entertaining. The story could have done that but it didn't become interesting until they started discovering where the Germans hid the art. Coincidentally, the same point when the film started following the real story.<br/><br/>""The Monuments Men"" very clearly wanted to help remember an important part of history and spark a debate about the cost of war on soldiers, civilians, and history and society. The debate is raging on, but the film missed the level of entertainment by not trusting its audience to be interested in exactly what happened."
"PWNYCNY","Null","121","163","7 February 2014"," Bland movie telling an important story.
","The movie deserves an A for effort but misses the mark dramatically. The question is: why? The story is evocative and the cast is excellent. Where the movie goes wrong is how it presents the story. The movie attempts to inject a whimsical element in story which is out of context. There was nothing whimsical about the plan to save priceless artwork. Also, the story moves at a slow pace and inspires little if any excitement or drama. The discoveries of the hidden artwork has little dramatic impact, nor do the interpersonal relationships between the characters which in the movie are shallow. Even the attempt at romance comes off as tepid and half-hearted, as well as implausible. The idea of a young, handsome, married American officer, alone in Paris, having dinner in the apartment of an attractive, intelligent, single French woman who made him dinner and not staying for at least another drink is a stretch. True, he is married and his faithfulness is commendable, but still .... The movie does have some strong dramatic moments, but in general the story is bland. Yet despite the movie's drawbacks, it still manages to tell a story about an historical event of great importance and significance, and for that reason alone is worth watching."
"steven-k-beck","1","62","85","14 February 2014"," Very Disappointing Film
","This much anticipated film is a dud. Too bad, as it had the chance to tell one of the more fascinating stories of WWII. A plodding plot drove a dozen viewers from the theater well before the film's end and Mr. Clooney wasted what could have been, at the very least, an entertaining cast. The thinly developed characters - Bill Murray seemed to have no more than four or five lines - gave the actors nothing with which to work and the viewer next to no emotional connection. I was hoping for a somewhat serious take with a few dashes of Oceans 11/12 and Kelly's Heroes spliced in, but found only one of the more disappointing films of the last few years. And the movie's fixation on cigarettes was a bit over the top. Yes, smoking was a big part of a soldier's life in WWII, but making a smoke part of the supporting cast is a little much. Any interest in this film is probably best sated by waiting for its release on cable. Not recommended."
"Ricc0","3","10","11","11 January 2017"," A Total Disaster.
","Based on real events, this film was a disaster! I'm writing this review while the film is still rolling... well it took me 4 days (everyday watching a bit of it) to get to the last half an hour of this film and I cannot bear watching one more second. If I was watching it in a movie theater I'd surely walk away.<br/><br/>In the true story, a force of around 300 men chased a huge number of European art treasures to save them from the Nazis and rescue the heritage of the Western civilization. I guess that the number of men was enormously reduced in this film so that the viewer could relate and connect to the characters.. well probably I couldn't care less even if a bomb demolished them all. Some of the real events were altered to serve the dramatic portrayal and every time the film tried to look serious the scenes only seemed hilarious.<br/><br/>The WAR COMEDY film was not funny and the war action scenes were so badly executed that they seemed like rehearsals.. For a moment there I thought that the main characters did not care about what they were doing.. as if some of them were forced to do it.. and this goes even for Cate Blanchett! I don't know how the movie managed to make her look so bad.<br/><br/>I did not really expect something so serious, but at least a light movie that makes you laugh.. something like ""The Men Who Stare at Goats"". Yet, this movie failed at every level. I only gave it 3/10 because it is based on a true story that was historically quite important. Or else I consider it only slightly better than ""Battle of Los Angeles (2011)""."

","In 1943, the American Professor Frank Stokes (George Clooney) convinces President Roosevelt that the art stolen by the German should be retrieved and he recruits six art experts to form the Monuments Men's unit to travel to Europe with him to search the treasures. On the arrival, they split to several cities to guide the Allies to find the arts to return them to the owners.<br/><br/>I do not know how accurate ""The Monuments Men"" is but this movie has a boring story, terrible screenplay and unconvincing performances. The movie is neither a drama nor an action movie or comedy and has several main characters divided in subplots, some of them interesting and others pointless. In the end, ""The Monuments Men"" is a very disappointing film and sort of war propaganda. My vote is four.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Caçadores de Obras-Primas"" (""Masterpieces Hunters"")"
"danew13","4","15","18","15 May 2014"," Seems Like a Very Bad Made for TV Movie
","The main theme that seems to run through this film is a love for cigarettes, not historic accuracy. It certainly wasn't a love of art. Because as an art form itself, the film was bad, which is more amazing due to the large stellar cast.<br/><br/>The main problems with Mon. Men are a lousy script, filled with pointless time wasting padding and an attempt to recover art all over Europe in 90 minutes or so.<br/><br/>It begins in 1943 when Clooney is trying to convince the Roosevelt to form a unit to rescue looted art. He's using the bombing of Monte Cassino in Italy as an example of what could happen to object'art all over Europe. The problem here is, Monte Cassino wasn't bombed until 1944.<br/><br/>Then it takes an entire year for his unit to be formed and six months later in July 1944 they land in Normandy to being their 10 month quest, which is filled mainly with boring small talk and careless excursions around enemy territory as if the war was over.<br/><br/>Their final big haul of art comes on the heels of the Russians arriving. They have to leave immediately, which in fact takes 10 minutes of disbelief. <br/><br/>Seeing this film you get the feeling Clooney feels he can sell anything to the public."
"dukeb0y","3","26","34","12 February 2014"," Interesting, to a degree.
","Only three stars. First, a glaring mistake. When the map of April 1943 is shown to President Roosevelt, is clearly shows Vichy France. Which no longer existed after November 1942. A similar map is used in 1944. Doesn't anyone check a history book?<br/><br/>I will agree, this movie is interesting, but poorly structured. For example, we have no clue as to how the extra soldiers were ordered to help the 'Monuments Men'(MM). The MM find a mine loaded with art, then suddenly, 100s of men and trucks show up to retrieve it. And yet earlier, a MM, could not even get two extra soldier as guards to go with him.<br/><br/>As far as the sets and equipment, it gets a passing grade. The Kubelwagen was a nice touch.<br/><br/>Three stars, that's it."
"dazfiddy","4","9","10","21 November 2018"," Totally unmemorable
","It is amazing that World War Two can still throw up interesting subjects for a movie such as this one. Allied teams sent into liberated Europe to claim art stolen by the Nazis. Director George Clooney has assembled a great cast including Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Cate Blanchett and Hugh Bonnevile. The movie does not work. There is no drama, no tension or even a scene that will linger in your memory. It is a very mediocre film. Maybe its a lack of interesting characters, or the poor script or the light hearted tone. It failed to click with me, and I love war movies! Luckily for me I watched it on blu ray rather at the cinema. The extras on the DVD confirmed what an interesting topic this is, and that Clooney's film failed to make it."

","What a waste of money and time. Had George employed the editors making the trailer to write, direct and edit this film, it might have actually been enjoyable. This was unfortunately one of the most disjointedly scripted movies I have ever had the misfortune to watch. The story was randomly hopping this way, that way, presenting completely unrelated anecdotes from the different missions the Monuments Men were on. As another IMDb reviewer (Wilbrifar) pointed out: "" It's like watching a sequel to a movie you didn't see; the characters are acting like ""here we are, old buddies together again in Part 2"" and the audience is left totally out in the cold because there was never a Part 1. "" That is very much how the movie felt; the actors were proficient in delivering their lines as well as they could, given the nightmare of a script they had to follow - but there was no chemistry between any of them at any point, so when they were getting all joking and friendly with each other, it just looked and felt awkward; like being at a party where you're watching someone be overly friendly to someone else. I would never watch this again."

","Having read the original book from which ""Monuments Men"" is taken, I was very interested to see the movie. There is a really fascinating and historically important story here, and it could have made a great film. However, soon after the show begins, it all starts to fall apart. The reason? George Clooney. He directed, and he wrote the screenplay. It's amazingly obvious that in neither of these capacities does Clooney know what he is doing. The screenplay is an absolute joke, totally disjointed, disconnected, silly, trite, and incredibly amateurish for a major Hollywood star of Clooney's stature. The same goes for the directing. George Clooney is obviously a guy with a huge ego, capable of fooling himself and a lot of other people who should know better, that he knows what he is doing. Film-making schools should show this movie as a classic example of what not to do. It's fundamentally flawed in every respect. Editing, music, etc.------one is taken aback by the unbelievable ineptness. Co-stars Matt Damon and Bill Murray and John Goodman and the rest of the cast merely parrot their lines in strange, disjointed scenes that beg to be rewritten by someone with a brain in his head. On the one hand, I totally condemn this piece of Hollywood egotistical stupidity, but on the other I heartily recommend it as an example of how bad movies can get in the hands of people with enormous egos. Stick to acting, Clooney---for God's sake don't direct and write screenplays ever again."

","The plot is similar to Burt Lancaster's The Train, done in the early 70's. The major difference is that in The Train, it was French Nationals trying to save their national art collection that was being stolen by the Nazi's near the end of the war. Trains were used to transport the valuable art to Germany. The French showed ingenious tricks to fool the Germans . It was a very well done movie and Burt Lancaster showed his greatness as a true movie star. This mess Americanized the French which made it very unrealistic and dishonest. The All Star cast with poor script, and equally poor dialog, must have been a big financial incentive for the casting associate, because no one including Cate Blanchett earned there salary. It was a very disappointing performance by George Clooney. I will think twice before a see another movie with George Clooney in it."

Each of The Monuments Men characters come from the arts world and are driven into action by the need to save precious art works spanning across Europe. Bill Murray is a genius per usual but lacks when it comes to on screen time. I feel as though many characters like John Goodman are overshadowed by the likes of Matt Damon and George Clooney. They make themselves very prominent in the script but often take time away from those who would truly make this film shine (Murray and Goodman).

But MEN aren't the only problem The MONUMENTS fail to grab our attention as well. <br/><br/>First off, if you counted how many rationalizations are made about saving artwork when so many humans are dying, you might get dizzy. With an exception of a few untimely deaths along the way, the artifacts are lazily gathered like an afternoon garage sale shopping spree. With all the running around, there's hardly any threat, in any direction... And speaking of direction: Half the time it's difficult to tell where we are, what we're doing, or what each mission entails.<br/><br/>You'll hear a lot of comparisons with Quentin Tarantino's INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS, another underdog in peril WW2 flick that, in this reviewer's opinion, also wastes an ensemble cast of ragtag heroes. But at least that portrait had a scene-stealing villain: These guys could have used someone more than an off-screen historical tyrant to keep them on their toes...<br/><br/>In fact, if it weren't for the bombed-out buildings and sporadic gunfire, you'd forget there was even a war raging at all."

Matt Damon was completely gone for most the movie then just showed up out of the blue. I can't remember any of the characters names. I could go on and on. The cinematography was poor. The movie lingered on stuff that was not entertaining then rushed like hell to get through anything with a point. None of the cast cared and neither did I."

Never thought much about George Clooney, wanted to see it because of the cast (Matt Damon, John Goodman, Cate Blanchett, Bill Murray, someone I thought was Joel Grey but wasn't).<br/><br/>Every frame is art.<br/><br/>It's a movie for someone who loves art history and world history and beauty and risking everything for a cause greater than yourself.<br/><br/>Driving home, we wondered why this movie was not better received.

","I don't know what the critics expected this movie to be.. an action flick? a thriller? a war movie? Actually it is a war movie. It shows some of the worst of what happened to human beings during WWII. Clooney also takes the time to allow us to meet these men, who could easily have stayed out of it. Who instead, made the heroic choice to put themselves in great danger to save the soul of humanity - its art. Kudos to Clooney for not cheapening their story with the traditional Hollywood ""flick"". I did not know about this history event and I found it interesting and absorbing and I fell in love with every one of those men and I thank them for what they did."

","Actors are professional pretenders. Movies that depict real life events, or literary works,are successful if they present persuasive indications, hoping to capture the spark of reality on stage or screen.<br/><br/>George Clooney is a sentimental man who conceals his sentimentalism well. He makes movies whenever he can about topics, people, and issues he cares about.<br/><br/>Having read the book this film was based upon, I was looking for gestures, expressions, persuasive indications of a movement most people, including me until very recently, were not aware of.<br/><br/>A story in today's Wall Street Journal proclaimed that the desire to save, protect, salvage and restore, and allow the present and the future to continue to enjoy art - is ongoing - even in such places as Afghanistan and Iraq. That article also dramatized General Eisenhower's efforts to ensure that American soldiers were respectful and appreciative of other countries' cultures and their artistic and other achievements.<br/><br/>I thought that the exposition, the part of the movie that was slowest moving, where each character had to be introduced and developed, then inserted into the rather tense and nervous camaraderie, such as it was, was the weakest part of the film; but even this part had the feel of a recapturing of the mis en scene of 1944 global Armageddon in the world.<br/><br/>I often forget that many of the Chicago group that made Saturday Night famous: John Belushi, Bill Murray and many others, were classically trained actors. Bill Murray listening to a record while in the shower is a great moment in theater, in acting, in verisimilitude, the art of making the gesture, the moment, seem so real that the audience forgets it is only a movie.<br/><br/>The entire cast behaved as if they truly were the architects, curators, sculptors, and connoisseurs they were portraying, and I felt that the movie got stronger and stronger after the going got really tough in their mission.<br/><br/>Kate Blanchett plays a tough French woman smoldering with an inner burning anger, and she is convincing in every scene she was in. I thought that she inspired and uplifted Matt Damon's performance.<br/><br/>I think the quality of the writing is uneven, but that is true not only of art, but of life. Sometimes, ordinary people utter mundane statements; sometimes, we are inspired to be eloquent, elegant. I think that ""The Monuments Men"" captured that reality, too.<br/><br/>I would love to see it again, and I urge anyone who is interested in the idea of saving precious works of art from military and other predators, to read the book by Robert M. Edsel."

It was very unrealistic because most of the scenes were rubbish. I mean who would leave 1000 tons of gold and 16 thousand artistic pieces unguarded in an abandoned mine? How is it possible that there is no one on the streets of Bruge the night before the German withdrawal of the town? And there were many more scenes like this..<br/><br/>The story was very chaotic.

","In 1943 during World War II, the Allies are making good progress driving back the Axis powers in Italy , but there took place the greatest art heist in history . However, Frank Stokes (George Clooney) persuades the American President Roosevelt that victory will have little meaning if the artistic treasures of Western civilization are lost in the fighting. Stokes is directed to assemble an Army unit nicknamed the ""Monuments Men"", comprising seven museum directors, curators, and art historians to both guide Allied units and search for stolen art to return it to its rightful owners . But as the Monuments Men, as they were called, found themselves in a race against time to avoid the destruction of 1000 years of culture, they would risk their lives to protect and defend mankind's greatest achievements and especially to rescue Altarpiece of Gante and Virgin sculpture by Michael Angel . As an unlikely World War II platoon is tasked to rescue art masterpieces from Nazi thieves and return them to their owners. They are the followings : Bill Murray as Richard Campbell , John Goodman as Walter Garfield , Jean Dujardin as Jean Clermont , Hugh Bonneville as Donald Jeffries , Bob Balaban .as Preston , Dimitri Leonidas and Matt Damon (Daniel Craig was cast in a role but ultimately he dropped out due to scheduling conflicts. Matt Damon replaced him). <br/><br/>The Monuments Men is a 2014 American-German war-comedy-drama war film directed by George Clooney, written and produced by Clooney and Grant Heslov, and with all-star cast such as Clooney, Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Jean Dujardin, Bob Balaban, Hugh Bonneville, and Cate Blanchett. Loosely based on the non-fiction book The Monuments Men: Allied Heroes, Nazi Thieves and the Greatest Treasure Hunt in History, by Robert M. Edsel. This action drama follows an Allied group, the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program, tasked with finding and saving pieces of art and other culturally important items before their destruction by Hitler during World War II . Intentions are noble and its cast is impressive, but neither can compensate for The Monuments Men results to be stiffly nostalgic and curiously slack narrative . The picture is pretty well , though the sense that the film is episodic and poorly structured . Principal photography by Phedon Papamichael began at the Babelsberg Studios in Potsdam, Germany, in the Berlin-Brandenburg region , being filmed on location Bad Grund, Lower Saxony , Osterwieck, Saxony-Anhalt, Merseburg, Saxony-Anhalt, Berlin , Germany and especially Neuschwanstein Castle , Bavaria, the castle where the art is stored. Evocative and appropriate musical score by Alexandre Desplat who also appears as a secondary actor . This lavishly film was well co-produced by Columbia Pictures in association with 20th Century Fox and Babelsberg Studio, being compellingly directed and produced by George Clooney . However , the film received mixed reviews from critics .<br/><br/>The flick was based on actual historical events , they are the followings : The ""Monuments Men,"" were a group of approximately 345 men and women from thirteen nations, most of whom volunteered for service in the newly created MFAA section during World War II. Many had expertise as museum directors, curators, art historians, artists, architects, and educators. As a platoon going into Germany to rescue artistic masterpieces from Nazi thieves and returning them to their rightful owners . Their job description was simple: to protect cultural treasures so far as war allowed. A task force appointed to research the origin of the robbed art has said that thousands pictures and sculptures fall into the category of art looted or extorted by the Nazis from Jewish collectors . These include pieces by Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Edvard Munch, Paul Cézanne and others."

Besides having no script, no challenge, no evolution of character or plot, this is acted as it we, the spectators, are complete idiots. On top of this, you have numerous deliberate cigarette propaganda inserts that contribute nothing to the incomprehensibly bland story line. I have been working with television and film for the last two decades, teaching photography and video as well as watching passionately films from all around the world, including Hollywood, which I enjoy very much, but this is simply one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my entire life.

Since the beginning, not a single movie-watcher cared as I took notice in all of their faces/airs.

No script, awful screenplay, poor cinematography & a torturous background score. Just because it is a war film doesn't mean you stick trumpets into it.<br/><br/>Lots of pretentious jokes about cigarettes and all seemed to be in-jokes because they made no sense. Not a single dialog worth quoting as is uncommon in Goerge Clooney films. No character depth, no real humor, no action sequence, as well. George Clooney walked throughout the film like he is loitering his time away. Matt Damon played a cameo. What was Bill Murray doing here? Hopeless!<br/><br/>More, even the characters were finding it friendly to joke and tease about themselves. There was not a single shard of seriousness in any of the scene except during the chronicling of the loss, which was tremendously pompous.<br/><br/>Just because I never get out of a movie mid-way I watched it for the whole 2 hours and left the place utterly disappointed. And then there is one speech-song that plays somewhere in the middle that pushed me to the brink of getting out. One last thing, the narration of the event in the film in the modified, deadpan voice of Clooney was the worst thing in the film.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: Do not waste your money on this.

"Kicino","5","11","16","26 February 2014"," Poor script wastes brilliant cast and fascinating story
","I was drawn by the stellar cast to see this and the storyline looks like interesting. But I was let down from the very beginning.<br/><br/>This is by far the weakest script I have seen for a long time. The story is worth telling as art is part of our collective heritage. How Hitler loved art and his subsequent snatching collections over Europe seemed a natural development of his invasion over Europe, but destroying these tens of thousands of priceless artwork when he failed was something the Allies had to stop. This aspect of WWII has not been told and how these brave men from the Allies saved our heritage – tens of thousands of paintings, altarpiece, water color, sculptures and archives - should be a fascinating story – if it was told well. <br/><br/>We have an excellent cast to start with - George Clooney (who also directs this piece), Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Jean Dujardin, and Cate Blanchett etc - all with superb acting skills. But the poor script and plot development scatter them in areas where we neither see their character development nor their passion in art even though they play the roles of architect, museum curator, professors and art historians who are sent to the warfront to save seized art collections from the Nazis and return them to their owners. With these experts' passion in art there should be a sense of solidarity and admiration but we do not see it. The portrayal of leadership and hard work by Frank Stokes (George Clooney) is also very weak.<br/><br/>The script structure is very loose and often focus on unnecessary details such as their hasty military training and how they interact with the frontline soldiers. The total positioning and tone of the film is misplaced. Art can be solemn and serious and it can be portrayed in a light-hearted way. Perhaps the producers were trying to create a lighter and comic atmosphere to lighten up the seriousness of art and history but it did not work very well and the audience is always left in mid- air. <br/><br/>The way they distilled the troupe of 300+ monuments men and women in real life to seven people is a good try – if they can vividly depict their characters but the film failed to do so. And towards the second half of the movie, showing how the task force discovered the hidden treasure and shipping them are just too bland and hasty. <br/><br/>All these pretty faces and excellent acting skills are wasted. It could have been much much better. I can perhaps only remember Cate Blanchet's sexy and strong French accent and her seductive gesture towards Matt Damon when she gives him her only copy of detailed ledger of art collections whisked away by the Nazis. Yet even her repeated line of ""This is Paris"" sounds pretentious and unnatural for her character. <br/><br/>It is a good intention to tell a WWII story from the point of preserving art and culture how brutal the Fuhrer is toward art, even though it is his interest and passion to loot them all into his Fuhrermuseum in Austria. Some of the haunting scenes, such as barrels of gold teeth from the Jews, and rows of paintings, sculptures and gold bars can be made more dramatic with camera angles and tracking. Another waste. The whole movie was like a buffet with excellent ingredients but poor cooking skills and display arrangement so the whole dining experience is ruined. Lot of sighs. It is in fact quite heart-wrenching to see such potentials wasted. It could have been an otherwise brilliant and amazing story.<br/><br/>Purely for your interest, for more details on the real Monuments Men, please see: http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/true-story-monuments-men- 180949569/"

","George Clooney's latest film tells a long-forgotten story: In the last phase 0of World War II, a group of art experts set up by the U.S. Army went on search for stolen and hidden art in order to rescue them from destruction or being transported to the Soviet Union. Clooney himself plays Frank Stokes, leader of these ""Monuments Men"", the cast includes the likes of Matt Damon, Caste Blanchett as well as, for the comic relief, Bill Murray and John Goodman. The film is strong when it comes to capturing the look of the times, whether it be occupied Paris or the battle fields of France, Belgium and Germany. This is where its strengths end. Driven by an unbearably obtrusive score, The Monuments Men is pure Hollywood at its very worst. The dialogue is bland and clichéd, the screenplay as if from a construction kit with all the dramatic turns, humorous interludes and romantic anecdotes a blockbuster needs, the photography completely unimaginative, the acting reduced to the purely routine. While the story is one that needs to be told, Clooney chooses the most unsatisfying way of telling it that could be imagined, making the film so slick and uninteresting it should not even do well at the box office. <br/><br/>http://stagescreen.wordpress.com/"

"pefrss","3","12","18","18 February 2014"," Grow up Clooney, this was no joking matter
","I deleted my first review when I realized that I was a victim of propaganda and wrong information and that the movie with its shallow entertainment value had lulled me into believing that it was actually entertaining. But as an artist the subject was too important to me and I revisited the documentary ""The rape of Europe"" and read everything else I could find about the Monuments, Fine Arts & Archives-Section (MFA&A) and the people involved to refresh my memory and as I did so, the more dissatisfied I became with the movie. First of all the primary goal of the organization was to protect historical buildings from the bombardment of the Allies. As reality and the movie showed the Monument Men were not very successful to convince the military men not to bomb irreplaceable buildings in Italy or Germany. Just think of Leonardo da Vinci's painting in the monastery near Milan which miraculously survived the bombardment and the Campodisanto in Pisa, which is still being restored nearly seventy years later. but many of the frescos which date back to 1300 are lost forever. Not to speak about Germany where entire cities with all their beautiful buildings were flattened. . <br/><br/>The other goal of the organization was to make sure that cultural treasures would not be looted by the victors, as it had been a tradition in any war since ever. The art historians realized that many soldiers had no idea about the value of art or furniture and would use it to build fires to keep themselves warm. The wonderful idea of the MFA&A was to think that even if the government of a country commits unspeakable acts, that the people of this country are still entitled to their cultural heritage and that it is an important part of rebuilding a country to leave the cultural heritage in that country.. <br/><br/>Another misrepresentation in the movie is that it gives the impression that all the art they found in the mines and castles were stolen by the Nazis. In reality Germany had her own program to protect the art and the museums themselves made sure that the art was transported into safe locations like mines and private homes for preservation. So for example the salt mine in Merkers. Everything stored there was stored by mostly Berlin museums to protect it from bombardment. Obviously the conditions in a salt mine are favorable for art . None of it was stolen by Nazis and the German museum people knew exactly where it was and would have recuperated it after the war and put it back in the museums. <br/><br/>In the last decade or so there were a few movies made about the Nazi time which were really thoughtful and do not paint a black and white picture, i.e. Americans or Allies all good, Germans all bad. Clooney made a cheap movie in the sense that he did not pay homage to the real achievement of the Monument men but instead plays the usual game of portraying the Americans as the good guys, conveniently he kills off the British and French Monument men early in the movie and does not mention that altogether there were over 300 people from different countries involved. He gives the impression that it was an all American venture.<br/><br/>The character Cate Blanchett plays had a real important role in finding a lot of the art, but in his movie she is more or less reduced to a love interest for Matt Damon. I went to see a few of Clooney's movies because I was interested in the subject matters he chooses and nearly always I was disappointed. He picks good subjects but does not deliver. His movies have no depth, most of them are forgettable. I also do not think that he can act. He always plays himself and while joking with his friends is okay when he goes on the talk show circuit, this movie was not the right forum for pranks. <br/><br/>In the documentary The Rape of Europe one of the professors in Austria deliberates what would have happened if the Viennese art school would not have rejected Hitler twice. Maybe we would live in a different world today. Maybe Hitler would have learned to appreciate modern art and would not have destroyed it as degenerate. Who knows?<br/><br/>The question if art is worth to endanger you life to save it, is a personal question. It is for me, I would never go to war because my government decides to fight another country because the representatives are financed by the armament industry, but I would participate in a mission to save art even if it is dangerous."

An obvious spin off of the Ocean 11 franchise, this romantic-meets-history-meets-attempted action mishmash is based on a fantastic true story and features more first class actors than any recent films and yet... It falls flat on its belly. Touchy-feely almost to the levels of Dr. Phil, disconnected from the reality or historical facts, this film is a prime example of great intentions going nowhere. Even though the film is set against the World War II backdrop, the war itself feels more like a spoof, something you would expect to see in Toy Story, and the goofy banter does not save the day (though it helps to distract). Sadly enough, the actors don't have enough ""shoulder room"" to play to their true potential, as their roles are rather schematic. Overall, it is not disappointing, yet not something worth spending time and money on. Wait for DVD"

This movie isn't supposed to be a heart-breaking drama or a war-action movie. It's just a movie about art and some things that happened during the war. It presents facts and raises awareness regarding arts and our history.You can't expect to see fights or violence in such a film. People say that the performances weren't good and there was little and unconvincing dialog. I disagree.

","Before I review the movie proper, some anachronisms: While there was a song called ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas"" in 1944 (Judy Garland introduced it in Meet Me in St. Louis), the words Ms. Garland sang then were a little different from what we know today. Like, instead of ""Hang a shining star upon the highest bough"" which was the line introed by Frank Sinatra in his 1957 recording, the line should have been ""Until then, we'll have to muddle through sometime"" which Judy sang in that movie I mentioned. Anyway, I very much enjoyed this dramatization of some art experts attempt to save as much of other countries' art from the Nazi regime as possible during World War II. Nice characterizations from Matt Damon, Cate Blanchett, John Goodman, Bill Murray, Bob Balaban, among others, and George Clooney who also did a nice job directing as well. Maybe there could have been a bit more drama in characterization but I was satisfied with what I got. There were some nice humorous scenes as well. So on that note, I recommend The Monuments Men."

Truly good movies do not need much hype, and this is truly not a good movie. <br/><br/>My numerical rating on IMDb is a ""6"" and I'm being kind; it could be and is being rated much lower by ""real"" moviegoers. I'm biased, I like George Clooney, I'm from the Cincinnati area, so he's a legend around here . . . and the very crowded 3:30 p.m. showing confirmed it. <br/><br/>This movie is not as bad as his horrible ""The Men Who Stare at Goats"" but no where near his fine ""Michael Clayton"" . . . and if you're looking for humor anywhere near his hilarious ""Oh Brother, Where Art Thou"", you'll be sorely disappointed. <br/><br/>I won't spoil any of the plot for you if you wanna go see this movie because there isn't much plot to spoil, it really needed some good screenplay writing. The dialog is flat and plodding, the actors are just walking around in various locations, you cannot relate to any of them or what they are doing, the plot is as disjointed as the scenes, and if you nod off during the terribly slow and dark beginning, you'll be easily forgiven. <br/><br/>But George is handsome, Cate is beautiful and the camera focus is good, so enjoy your popcorn, it'll be the highlight."

They respected the historical events enough to avoid the temptation of catering to the violence-numbed populous. I respect George Clooney for that. He knows the business well enough to know he was making a ""dull"" movie, but the story was more important to him than making some extra $$$.<br/><br/>The characters involved were not easy to get to know, but it seems that every actor did a good job in capturing what was known of the personalities (after being filtered through the book...?). There was a lot of talent on the set, but no detectable egos run amok - all the performances seemed professional as works of love and respect. Some could rightfully claim that these were not the best performances of these actors' careers, but I would claim they were among the most dedicated and heartfelt.<br/><br/>I give it a nine instead of a ten because I am rather certain it would have been a better movie if Barbara Hall had not been involved. I'm sure George had his reasons for including her, and we will never really know what it may have been without her (perhaps we can thank her of the absence of the gratuitous violence!)<br/><br/>Anyway, well done. It is an enjoyable look at what may be one of the last unique looks at WWII..."

","Occasionally a film comes along, based on a true story, that really opens your eyes. That's what The Monuments Men did for me. I was aware that the Nazis had stolen artwork during WWII but I wasn't aware of the scale of what they had done.<br/><br/>George Clooney was obviously moved by the story as he wrote this screenplay, directed and produced the movie and acted in it.<br/><br/>Looking every bit the 50s movie idol George leads a great cast including John Goodman, Matt Damon and Bill Murray. For a war story it has a very light touch. The story is told in small vignettes of the bigger tale. This is a little disjointed and possibly gives the idea that finding the stolen art was a fairly simple task but there are some wonderful scenes which allow me to forgive the minor flaws here. The shower scene with Bill Murray is very moving and the scale of some of the sets is breath-taking. There is some amazing scenery and the art dept must have been stretched on this one.<br/><br/>I felt moved, entertained and educated when I came away from the cinema. Overall, a really good film. Worth a look.<br/><br/>Just so you know, the film carries a warning - ""Contains violence, details of bloody injuries and scenes of smoking"". Seriously, that's what it said at the beginning."

","I loved it. Anything with Matt Damon or George Clooney is an automatic ""Go see!"" for me. Add John Goodman and Cate Blanchet and it only gets better. I heard one or two unflattering critics' comments about the movie a week or so ago, and was a little nervous that maybe the Laws of the Cosmos had been reversed in some fashion and the movie would not be good, despite its can't-lose topic and Oscar-great cast. I needn't have worried- it was marvelous.<br/><br/>I don't want this to be about what's wrong with those critics, but perhaps you'll find a small bit of that helpful to decide that you should treat yourself to this wonderful project? I suspect that if anyone didn't find themselves entranced and entertained it might have been because they were expecting something else. ""Saving Captain America"" or something.<br/><br/>The film deals with choices we make as a people. What do we value? What might be worth fighting and dying for? Personal power, glory, and money? (read: the Nazis' and Stalinists' cause). Or human striving for charm and grace and love and compassion and harmony and ""art,"" as imperfectly as we may have carried that out? (read: the Allies' cause, in principle, anyway).<br/><br/>This IS a thrilling movie- but the thrills are very real, thus not sexy. I'm a scholar by trade (social psychology) and have studied this era and human relations extensively. As near as I can determine, this is how the war went for most people. And this project in real life, I hear, was rather quiet, and not thought to be glamorous- despite its ""monumental"" importance and its consequences for humanity (pardon the pun).<br/><br/>There is real danger in the movie. And suspense- made more gripping by the vast scale of the stakes... but of course made a bit more bearable by our knowledge that we won the war, and saved a vast chunk of our cultural heritage with the mission depicted in this movie.<br/><br/>For myself, I felt a surge of pride toward the end when the movie showed filmed newsreel items, re-enacted from the day. Yes, it showed the Army generals gloating over the cache of more than one hundred tons (!!! - worth more than $4 BILLION at today's price) of stolen gold recovered from the salt mine where the Nazis had hidden it. Hey- I'd gloat too! But it also showed the overall integrity of the Allies illustrated by their care and concern to return the art - worth jillions of dollars - to the countries, families, cities, museums, that were the rightful owners.<br/><br/>That just reminded me that while the flag-waving and money-making and glory-seeking may be the norm in this world, there are also millions of decent, honest, caring, compassionate, and spectacularly honorable humans among us. It feels good to know they were there then; it heartens me to suddenly realize that they are still out there today.<br/><br/>""Monuments Men"" allowed me to enjoy a riveting and entertaining story about the best of humanity."
"Danusha_Goska","8","23","44","8 February 2014"," Big Fun, Big Heart, Old Fashioned
","""The Monument Men"" is a fun, old-fashioned, feel good movie. I walked out of the theater inspired. The movie isn't perfect but its gifts outweigh its flaws. <br/><br/>""The Monument Men"" tells the story of a group of art experts recruited by the US armed forces during WW II to ensure that Europe's artistic heritage was not destroyed in the war. <br/><br/>Hitler had been a painter before he became fuhrer. Joseph Goebbels was a novelist. Speer was an architect. Filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl did as much to spread Nazism as many troops. Nazis didn't just mass murder human beings. They burned books and paintings. They worked very hard to destroy ""decadent"" art and to elevate and appropriate art they deemed worthy. Nazis plundered and stockpiled other countries' art. Just the other day, Feburary 6, 2014, art the Nazis stole from Poland was repatriated. In January, 2014, the World Jewish Congress demanded that Germany do a better job of returning art. <br/><br/>There's a long tradition of World War II movies about international, all-star teams of experts uniting to achieve some goal: ""The Great Escape,"" ""The Guns of Navarone,"" ""Kelly's Heroes,"" ""Dirty Dozen,"" ""The Longest Day,"" ""A Bridge Too Far."" And of course George Clooney is a veteran of the ""Oceans"" movies. <br/><br/>""The Monument Men"" is a little bit WW II team movie, a little bit Oceans. The team members are shown going about their day to day lives when George Clooney shows up and signs them up. The movie is based on a real project, and it plays like the best anecdotes from that project's team members. It's a series of vignettes that aren't particularly coherently connected. Some of the vignettes were not clear to me. Why was Matt Damon suddenly flying in a biplane over Paris at night? It was a pretty scene but I didn't understand how it fit into the rest of the plot. Why was the German-Jewish translator, Sam, suddenly carrying a wounded soldier into a mobile army surgical unit? Who was that soldier? Not sure. <br/><br/>Other vignettes are really gripping, moving, suspenseful, and/or funny. The movie won me over with its depiction of a British art expert's heroic attempt to rescue a Michelangelo Madonna from Belgium. I cried. I was inspired. <br/><br/>There is a funny, scary, sickening scene where a beefy German dentist hammers away at Bill Murray's teeth with a mallet and pliers while Bob Balaban makes provocative commentary about how he bets all the Germans were innocent – not. <br/><br/>There's a powerful scene where Americans are invited to a German home for dinner, and discover that the paintings on the dining room walls are too good to be reproductions. <br/><br/>The movie is flawed. Its editing is choppy. It feels rushed. I got the sense that not enough time was devoted to cast members building bonds with each other. John Goodman and Jean Dujardin are meant to be tight team members, but I saw no real chemistry between them. Not nearly enough time is devoted to fleshing out the all-star cast's characters, or to simple exposition. I'd simply like to know more about everything on screen, from the Ghent altarpiece to Hitler's Nero decree. I would like to have seen the Nero decree's destruction of art placed into the context of the mass suicides at the end of the war. Hitler's suicide isn't even mentioned in ""Monuments Men."" <br/><br/>Sam, a GI, is recruited as a German translator. The average moviegoer might have no idea that Sam is Jewish. Sam says, ""I'm from NORTH Newark."" How many moviegoers know that North Newark was a Jewish neighborhood? Sam says that his grandfather in Germany was not allowed to enter a museum and joked about being barred because he was ""too short."" The real reason he was barred is that he was a Jew, but the movie never states that plainly. <br/><br/>I got the impression that Clooney was making his film for people with short attention spans who want the shallowest treatment possible of the subject matter. That's too bad, because with a little more tender loving care, this could have been a great movie rather than a good one. <br/><br/>Some popular culture and even academic retellings of WW II work to humanize, or even exculpate, Germans. ""Monuments Men"" does not. At first I thought that Sam would be the good German character – the noble ""true"" German who hated the Nazis from the get-go, resisted them, and was now helping the allies defeat them. But Sam turns out to be Jewish. ""Monuments Men"" uses the word ""German"" were a more German-friendly film would be careful to use the word ""Nazi,"" thus emphasizing that not all Germans were guilty, but merely an ideology. <br/><br/>""Monuments Men"" is unusual among recent American films in that it unapologetically and enthusiastically celebrates Western Civilization and the Christian heritage as something that utopians – in this case Nazis – tried to destroy, and that good people – among them Americans – heroically and courageously died to preserve. This is a really remarkable message. I wonder if left-wing Clooney embraced it because he saw ""Monuments Men"" as being about Art, not about Western Civ or the Judeo-Christian heritage. The two artworks focused on the most – the Ghent altarpiece and the Michelangelo Madonna are both overtly Christian."

","""The Monuments Men"" was a film I'd been looking forward to seeing in some time. I'm a big fan of war films, and equally a big fan of most of the impressively assembled cast. This could be classified as an adventure/war film that flirts with the idea of trying to be a comedy. But funny it is not, and is in fact a monumental disappointment, not doing any justice at all to the story.<br/><br/>George Clooney plays a re-incarnated version of various characters he has played before, as he leads a team of museum curators and art experts on a mission to war-torn Europe in a bid to save art from the Nazi's and by the films end, the Russians. The film's premise is promising, and should have made for a cracking film, but then falls down pretty much after the first scene. Other than Cate Blanchette (who is amazing in most of her roles) the rest of the star-studded line-up were terrible. Matt Damon was bland in his role, Bill Murray looked disinterested throughout, John Goodman looked as though he's fallen off the wagon again, Jean Dujardin had this stupid smirk on his face before meeting a stupidly conceived demise, and Hugh Bonneville didn't actually do anything except die. Even the two German baddies featured were unconvincing. There was no real action, and absolutely no emotional attachment to any of the characters. I thought it was a shame that more of them weren't killed. The Americans all survived (sigh), with the two foreign participants both dying (sigh). This film was dreadfully dull and far too predictable.<br/><br/>In all, a hugely disappointing film. I wouldn't even bother with this on a DVD night. In fact, I want my twelve bucks back, George. I'm not happy at all. Next time I'm in Como, I'll be dropping by your villa looking for a refund. You've been great in other films, but your performance in this one really sucked... along with your direction. Maybe stick to more contemporary themes in the future. And don't be making any more films with Matt Damon because you'll ruin him if you produce another turkey like this one and he's in it."
"RyanCShowers","Null","4","5","26 March 2014"," An Award Season Misfit Moved to a February Release
","In the early scenes of ""The Monuments Men,"" director George Clooney introduces his supporting cast of characters portrayed by John Goodman, Bill Murray, and Bob Balaban. Humiliatingly sending this group of elderly actors through physical fitness trainings before the film transitions into its World War II plot, the audience could confuse ""The Monuments Men"" with last November's ""Last Vegas.""'<br/><br/>""The Monuments Men"" boasts an impressive advertisement to entice the interest of the public. The cast includes Matt Damon, Cate Blanchett, and Clooney himself; three reliable actors who can usually earn their films a stamp of approval. However, ""The Monuments Men"" deceives its audience with a promise of a quality storyline that features American soldiers searching to retrieve irreplaceable art that Hitler and the Nazis have stolen from France.<br/><br/>George Clooney may have been on the path of becoming the next Warren Beatty, a heartthrob actor turned serious director, until ""The Monuments Men."" His direction is not the film's sorest aspect, but the directing itself is substantially weaker than the skills he has shown recently with ""The Ides of March"" and ""Good Night, and Good Luck."" He attempts to run the story with a path in mind, but his attempts feel like his legs were injured while trying run on that path. The film's score adds an essence of floating patriotism, which offsets the comedic tone established by writing.<br/><br/>The difficulty of ""The Monuments Men"" is the screenplay. In addition to acting and directing, Clooney also wrote the screenplay with co-writer Grant Heslov for ""The Monuments Men."" The dialogue tries diligently to make clever cultural references and create amusing one-liners, but most of the written word in the script flops like a poorly made piece of sushi. I wonder if Clooney was consciously writing the script or if he was actually executing effort; if that is the case, my heart goes out to his lacking ability to write competent dialogue.<br/><br/>With those high-status actors, one would think they would be able to be the saving grace of ""The Monuments Men."" Sadly, the male actors show no signs of characterization, making their characters feel like extensions of their own personalities. The only performer who is marginally successful is Cate Blanchett. In her Oscar-winning performance in ""Blue Jasmine,"" Blanchett played a character that arguably no other actress could portray except her. In contrast, her character, Claire in ""The Monuments Men"" is a role generic enough to be played by any aspiring actress. In her first scene, Claire spits into someone's drinking glass and my response was a sympathetic one, knowing Blanchett is capable of better work.<br/><br/>""The Monuments Men"" wants to be a serious film, but falls back on comedy, becoming a real- life treasure hunt. Clooney attempts to force sentiment on his audience, but it is unearned and unwanted. ""The Monuments Men"" was originally set to release last December (a fitting release for pushing films in the Oscar race), but was moved to an alternative February. My guess is the studio realized ""The Monuments Men"" was nothing more than an award season misfit."

Frank Stokes<br/><br/>Considering the great art works recovered from the Nazis in 1944 by the Monuments Men, losing 2 lives in the operation might have been worth it. Or at least that's the struggle of the hero in the titular film inspired by the events: Frank Stokes (George Clooney), a curator at Harvard's Fogg Museum, goes back to the Army to head a small art recovery contingent (7—most out of shape and aging like John Goodman), with echoes of the Magnificent Seven and Dirty Dozen recruiting sequences, promising exceptional wit and action that doesn't materialize.<br/><br/>Why is such a high-concept plot lost in a February opening? Possibly because it's enjoyable but not remarkable, a pastiche of brief episodes not always connected to the plot's central vision (shooting at a German sniper youth thought to be an adult?). The episodes may be meant to establish character while sliding over them to chronicle a not always interesting path to the mines and castle where the Nazis have hidden the loot. At least the studio had the good sense not to pit this modest adventure against, say, American Hustle or 12 Years a Slave in the Oscar prelims in November and December.<br/><br/>The action picks up as they find the destinations, but along the way James Granger (Matt Damon) interacts with Claire Simone (Cate Blanchett) in a low-key romance that finds great art but small love. Changing Claire from the original monument woman Rose into a love-seeking operative angers some historians. Another concern besides history and coherence is tone: Reverence for the mission clashes with the jokey camaraderie of old-fashioned WWII movies.<br/><br/>It is a delight to hear the names of artists like Picasso and Rembrandt even though they had little influence on the film's fair-to midlin' screenplay penned by Clooney and Grant Heslov. Looking for Michelangelo's Madonna of Bruges and van Eyck's Ghent Altarpiece is definitely grand, but the grandeur is not matched by the screenplay.<br/><br/>As for directing, Clooney misses the sharpness of his Good Night and Good Luck while he helms here what seems a small story about an odd group of soldiers struggling to rise to the occasion of history's greatest art reclamation.

Most frustrating for viewers like myself, keen to know more about this topic. The tongue in cheek humour was the deal breaker for me - it was as if trying to appeal to the masses and win them over and like the film further taking us away from any depth or exploration of this dark time in history and and depth of the topic. It seemed like a pointed insult to the real life people working under such perilous circumstances, but you wouldn't have known that only for the fact the WWII and Nazi's were mentioned. <br/><br/>Film can be a powerful medium in reminding the world of the true horrors of war, in particular the kind inflicted by the Nazi's.

This war film has a deliberately old-fashioned feel, being more light hearted and comic approach, being an adventure for a group of unlikely of men trying to preserve many masterpieces of Western Culture. But the jokes for the most part fall flat or offer minor chuckles and smiles. Plus Clooney's direction and writing does go for very sentimental and sappy and he seems to not be able to take a tone, whether to be a romp or be more dramatic as it heavily hints towards the Holocaust. The sloppy writing is as Clooney tries to juggle the tones, skip past some dark themes like a child sniper (which was played for laughs) and has major pacing issues as at some parts the film skips through some parts of the film, such as the recruitment and training of the characters yet slow down at other times. Matt Damon and Cate Blanchett were given particularly thankless roles as they work together in Paris, disappearing as the rest of the cast fight on the front line.<br/><br/>Despite Clooney's noble intentions and excellent cast The Monuments Men falters with his misjudged tone and Clooney has made better films as a director."

The real life photos over the end-titles indicate that it certainly wasn't all made up.<br/><br/>Though this premise is a little less than gripping ('scraping the bottom of the barrel' in terms of war stories comes to mind), it must have looked good on paper: George Clooney (both starring and directing), Matt Damon, Jean Dujardin (though without Uggie), John Goodman, Bill Murray, Hugh Bonneville and Cate Blanchett (hot Oscars property for Blue Velvet). ALL IN THE SAME FILM. They'll all sure look good on the side of a London bus – - and they do.<br/><br/>However, unfortunately this is not a good film. It's not even a good war film.<br/><br/>The whole film feels like its been stitched together from 3 minute long vignettes, without any sort of arc of a story and nothing to stop the viewer getting restless. What IS Matt Damon actually doing in Paris for all that time, other than having a nice holiday? Why does one of the lead characters lamely hide behind a wall while he (sorry, spoiler, it is a he) is being shot – is his acting so dodgy that he can't be seen on camera? Why does George Clooney – so brilliant in The Descendants – lapse into this rolling eyed twitchy performance that typified his early roles? Why is Cate Blanchett given so little to do? And why is her boss such a terrible shot?

Bill Murray shows just what a good character actor he is away from his comedy roles. The scene in the shower where he hears his message from home is genuinely touching. And as a massive fan of Spielberg's Close Encounters, I have a particular soft spot for Bob (""I'm a mapmaker"") Balaban. Here he is one of the lesser known 'stars', but he gives one of the best performances in the film.<br/><br/>And there is a jaunty score from Alexander Desplat (""The Kings Speech"") – seemingly omni-present at the moment in the scoring room.

The actors are generally half-hearted and the movie is completely devoid of momentum and suspense. The story unfolds like the dramatization of a textbook, with few exceptions (the scene with the Christmas carol, and the letter/operation to rescue the Bruges Madonna were pretty good). Why? In part because the script is too full of dry little quips, yet this movie is not actually funny enough to be a comedy. . Clooney tells the monuments men's story like a guy relating an epically bad backpacking trip to his bro-friend at a bar. Comedic relief is only successful if there is something dramatic enough to relieve us from (the landmine scene? seriously?). <br/><br/>Another problem is the characters. These historical figures are absolutely fascinating and are part of what makes this story so compelling, yet in the script they aren't nearly as fleshed out or interesting as they could be. Clooney's depiction of Claire, for example is insulting. She was they key to the entire operation, but instead of depicting her strength he reduces an enigmatic woman into a desperate love interest - as though it is cinematically impossible to have a female character in a movie without using her for romantic tension.

Most of the conversation in the movie were one-liners. And poor ones at that. <br/><br/>The movie failed to make us care about any of the characters or their mission.<br/><br/>It's really a shame. The movie had great potential with such a star studded cast.<br/><br/>I wish the movie would have given more of a reason why art is more important than human lives aside from just pretentiousness about how art is ""important"". I think most people in the theater when they saw the art were thinking about the monetary value of the art even more than the humanitarian aspect."

","Not one redeeming moment in this film. Bad writing, bad acting, bad directing. The story is so poorly executed that you don't know what is going on or care about the characters.

George Clooney is one of the writers on an adapted screenplay. Two things are apparent:<br/><br/>1. Clooney should stick to acting. 2.

"jjesusdei90","3","2","2","6 January 2015"," Movie was so BAD that I had to make a Review...
","Well first of all, I have to say that I have been looking for a different World War 2 movie for a while and i thought this movie would be it...After seeing the trailer, for the first time, i also thought this was a good movie and it was worth watching, but i was wrong... This movie was so bad that i had to do my this review and here is why:<br/><br/>There are so many plot wholes, time lapses, historical in inaccuracies, badly used props like different ranks in the same uniform, comedy in places where it shouldn't have, scenes that make no sense and plenty more... This movie must be the worst movie i haver saw, and i must tell you that i saw C and B grade Movies and even D grade Movies that were better in terms of plot, ambiance and scenes, but just didn't have this enormous budget like this movie did.<br/><br/>I will write a little about the movie but not too much since its not needed to talk about something so bad...<br/><br/>The movie starts, with a women that works in a Paris Museum, under the orders of a Nazi ""Doctor"", the funny thing is there is so many wrong things with this that makes me laugh, first of all, this doctor has two or three different ranks in his uniforms, which makes this a terrible terrible mistake, then he knows that the brother of this woman is involved with the resistance and they attempted to capture some art that the Nazi stole, so he confronts the woman about it because he knew only her knew the details, but doesn't even kill her, even if that makes sense to you, then wait for the next scene were the Allies almost reached Paris and these ""Doctor"" and the Nazis are on the run, and try to take the train with some art stolen, meanwhile the woman runs to a bridge and starts screaming "" i can see you"" to the ""Doctor"" he then starts shooting her with a pistol from long distance, while she stands still, even though he missed, for me this scene was a joke, that makes no sense. Along the movie, this woman had little to no substantial appearance and almost made no part of the movie, even though at the beginning the movie made us believe that she was important. After that scene the movie continues with the Monuments Men, which are some art curators that suddenly are lieutenants, colonel, and other ranks just because they can, they form up the team and after that, they decide to split up to some cities around Europe, to protect the most valuable pieces of art. So fast forwarding the movie, one of them went to protect the most valuable art the Madonna, and told the priests to block the door, and don't open it under any circumstances. The Germans, smart guys, brought someone wounded, and when the priests saw it, they opened the door, anyway, this ""Monument Men"", was a sergeant at least (according to uniform) and the had surprise factor (hiding in a corner behind a wall), when the German office came close the American soldier shot him first, but even with all those conditions he shots the German in the arm, that was about 2 m from him, while the German shoots him twice right in the chest, even though the American was breeding, he doesn't even try or continue to shoot the German, and the Nazis walked away with the Madonna. The movie fast forwards a lot, doesn't even show how did they get there, in some scenes, and its all disconnected, even the Russians in the end appear to me happy to lose the art pieces to the Americans.<br/><br/>Anyway, the movie was so bad, that it shouldn't even exist, don't waste any money on it, because its 2 hour long and its not even worth it..."

That's not possible to make a film without reading at least one good history book. I liked George Clooney as an actor, he was really great.

","Not a bad concept, having never seen this explored on film before. There is a combination of historical accuracy and Hollywood license in this film, which depicts a group of art aficionados who pursue great works stolen by Hitler during WWII. What the film has going for it is a unique story and great cinematography. What's missing is that all of the characters are flat, without much zest or emotion, neither positive or negative. One would think that non-soldiers risking their lives for the preservation and proper return of centuries old art would act more passionately about their task.<br/><br/>For example, we never see the pathway to redemption of one of the group of six, who gives his life on this mission - that aspect is too lightly glossed over. Instead we see more muted performances, and a waste of talent from the likes of John Goodman, Bob Balaban, and Bill Murray. Even the last German officer who destroys one of the remaining mines where many pieces are stowed seems to have no motivation for his actions. The one bright spot in the movie was Cate Blanchett, who gives an impassioned performance and is about the only believable character we see."

","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)<br/><br/>Rating: 3/5 stars<br/><br/>""The Monuments Men"" takes an immensely exciting subject on paper and then proceeds to toe a fine line between serving it in a deserved enthralling manner and almost ruining its brilliant concept by presenting it in deliberately dreary fashion, bordering on the verge of being pretentiously somber and unintentionally tedious. Alas, while oscillating between these two extremities, the film fortunately or unfortunately falls into a vacuum of modestly engaging storytelling, where the viewer's attention is just about held with some sporadically inspiring scenes and tense moments.<br/><br/>Donning the Director's mantle, Clooney surprisingly misses many a trick by not delving deeper into a plot that presented numerous possibilities for an engrossing WWII mission in the vein of such classics as ""The Guns of Navarone"", ""The Dirty Dozen"", ""Where Eagles Dare"", ""Inglorious Basterds"", and ""Kelly's Heroes"" to name a few. Sadly, Clooney ends up desperately clinging to a few well-executed scenes towards the climax, to save his film from being a complete disaster. Moreover, his lackluster direction is astutely shielded by a stellar ensemble cast, who each perform admirably well in their grossly underwritten roles.<br/><br/>Based on a truly motivational true story, ""The Monuments Men"" could have easily turned out to be a much more entertaining if not classic war movie with better planning and prudent execution. Alas, it ends up exposing us to an almost forgotten chapter of WWII heroism - one which was equally important as the war strategies and legendary battles in standing up against the fascist Nazi regime, especially since these gallant souls preserved our art and culture, the very essence of history and existence - even if it does so in a jarringly slipshod manner."
"peterp-450-298716","4","2","2","6 May 2014"," Respect for what they did in reality, but the movie is a bit boring ...
","""If you destroy their history, you destroy their achievements and it's as if they never existed."" <br/><br/>""The Monuments men"" is a boring movie. Thank God there were people during the 2nd World War who were concerned about the cultural heritage and with a selfless commitment went to the battlefields of Nazi Germany to recover the looted artworks. It's a story based on true events, but I still doubt if it was necessary to make a film about those events. In ""The Guns of Navarone"" they gathered ​​a commando to destroy those damn huge cannons. In ""Saving Private Ryan"" a group of soldiers got orders to look for a certain Ryan (of course) whose brothers been killed on the battlefield. In ""The Monuments Men"" some old aged connoisseurs of art, sacrifice themselves to find stolen artworks. They also could have called it ""Saving a Private Collection"". But this one isn't that heroic and exciting. You would expect this to be a masterpiece with such a cast and such an original story about the 2nd World War. Ultimately, it isn't a movie of the same valuable level as those pieces of art they tried to save.<br/><br/>George Clooney co-wrote this film, has directed it and also plays the lead role as Frank Stokes, an art expert at age who puts together a group of eight other art historians, architects and professors to go to distant Europe and find some lost art. It's also a race against the clock since the Russians are also keen to get those artworks in their possession. For the Russians, it's a kind of payment for the losses they suffered during the war, while ""The Monuments Men"" have the noble aim to deliver it back to the original owners. The other members of the group consists of the three American greybeard's Richard Campbell (Bill Murray), Walter Garfield (John Goodman) and Preston Savitz (Bob Balaban), the Englishman Donald Jeffries ( Hugh Bonneville ) who apparently has to make up for something, the Frenchman in exile Jean Claude Clermont (Jean Dujardin) and James Granger (Matt Damon) and Sam Epstein (Dimitri Leonidas).<br/><br/>Again Clooney looks like the perfect son in law and behaves as usual as a charming Hollywoodstar. I'm constantly amazed about the fact that no matter what Mr.Clooney does, his hair always looks immaculate and well groomed. It seemed as if there is still a renowned stylist on every corner in this recreated-to-rubble Germany who has the time to fix his hair again. For the rest, it seems like an ""Ocean's Eleven"" in uniform. Even the conversations with Damon look like a duplicate of ""Ocean's Eleven"" : such a jovial, toneless and dry informal conversation between two close friends. Same routine.<br/><br/>Matt Damon plays again the smiling charmer who tries to help himself using his pitifully poor French (To be honest, I couldn't understand anything he said) on his way to Paris, where he will meet a woman called Claire Simone (Cate Blanchett). Claire is the curator of the Jeu de Paume, a former art museum that became a depot of stolen art. She could possibly point out the locations where the Nazis have hidden their loot. However, she is an old-fashioned young woman who stubbornly refuses to help him, out of fear that it would disappear in the hands of the U.S. The fact that this frigid aunt suddenly felt her hormones working and encouraged Damon to clean up the produced cobwebs during the war, after she was so kind to ask if he was a ""good husband"", I found a useless and meaningless filler which had nothing to do with the rest of the story.<br/><br/>The most enjoyable performances were done by the comic trio of the whole gang: Murray, Goodman and Balaban. Although their efforts unfortunately couldn't save the movie. Murray walked around again as if he could care less. The famous dry humor was briefly interrupted by one of the most moving moments: playing a vinyl record he received with a Christmas message of his daughter and grandchildren. An intimate moment between all the misery of war. Goodman was again the lame softy you expect anytime to emit a thunderous roar of laughter, but also has its sad moment when he and Clermont ends up in a crossfire between the two armed forces. Balaban is an irascible rascal who has one great desire when they arrive in Europe : the opportunity to kill somebody over there.<br/><br/>Don't expect action packed war scenes because the art rescuers follow the advancing forces during the whole movie and arrive in every historically known location after the Germans and allied forces have left. There are countless films about the horrors of the 2nd World War, but this story was still unknown to me. That made it more interesting to watch. The fact that there are two Belgian cities in the movie where valuable works of art were stolen , is also something that aroused my curiosity. The sometimes amusing dialogues and funny moments are interspersed with touching moments and a few moralizing and corny moments . But overall it was just a weak movie. In content it's not really an epic story : a group of elderly men running back and forth through Germany looking for paintings and sculptures . That they made a 2 hour movie about that, is in itself an achievement .<br/><br/>More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be/"

","Frank Stokes (George Clooney) is a Harvard art conservationist, who sees the great art of the world being stolen by the Nazis in World War II. Germany wants to build a museum if the Fuhrer, filled with the stolen artwork from the Louvre. He brings the story of the art theft to FDR, (Michael Dalton) who in turn asks Stokes to go into Europe, and recover the stolen art. Stokes puts together a team of older art experts, James Granger (Matt Damon) Richard Campbell (Bill Murray) Walter Garfield (John Goodman) Preston Savitz, (Bob Balaban) a Frenchman, Jean Clermont (Jean Dujardin) and an Englishman, Donald Jeffries. (Hugh Bonneville) The group must join the army and follow patrols into German cities as they fall. Granger has to find Claire Simone (Cate Blanchett) who probably knows more about the stolen art than anyone in France, but Claire is not talking, because she has been jailed by the French for being a collaborator and doesn't trust anyone. The mission takes place with the Nazis in retreat in 1944, but the mission is still fraught with danger. Jeffries loses his life guarding the Bruges Madonna in Belgium, and what starts as a mission to save the greatest artwork in history, becomes a mission of life and death. Stokes think he knows where the art is kept, but when he gets to the first city in Germany where he thinks the art is kept, there are no art pieces to be found. Where in Germany is the art being kept? Can James Granger get any information from Claire Simone? <br/><br/>I have mixed feelings about The Monuments Men, it is an interesting story, one that I knew nothing about, but there doesn't seem to be enough of a story to sustain two hours of filmmaking, so there are points where the movie drags. The cast tries to fill the slow spots with comedy, but World War II is still a very serious topic, so there is a limit to how much comedy they can put in a movie like this. There doesn't seem to be a lot of conflict in the film, the Monuments Men seemingly cruised through Germany to find this art with seemingly little resistance or hardship of any kind. With no conflict, there's no real emotional hook to this movie,it's a hybrid, it tries to be a movie about art and culture, but it also tries to be a war movie. But it's not Schindler's List, or Saving Private Ryan, or the Great Escape or Stalag 17, it's not even Inglorious Basterds.<br/><br/>The story is not cohesive, that is both the writer and director's fault, and since both are George Clooney, he has to shoulder the blame for it. The story skips from the hunt for the art to the subplot between Claire and James, which features a clumsy attempt at romance, which detracts from the main plot, which is not that strong in the first place.<br/><br/>The cast is excellent, they make the material better than it is. I don't like Clooney's dull monotone delivery, but even he has a good scene interrogating a Nazi officer about the lost art, and the officer's participation in concentration camps. Matt Damon is very good as Granger, the man trying to cajole information from Claire. Cate Blanchett is good, as Claire, a sweet, librarian type, who has lost her ability to trust. John Goodman, Bill Murray, Bob Balaban, and Jean Dujardin all add comedic flourishes, and make the movie more enjoyable than the material.<br/><br/>I would say this is a good movie to rent, but not great for the theaters.<br/><br/>For more monumental reviews, visit my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpress.com."

","Finally watched this one on the big screen today. Get why they moved it to Feb. It has all the right pieces, and is a serviceable piece of drama; but is a tad underwhelming (not in a bad way). <br/><br/>In spite of that, this is very much up Clooney's alley as a filmmaker, and has him not just reuniting with Damon and Blanchett ('The good German'), but also bring along the reclusive Bill Murray, the Coens' Special John Goodman, and the extremely under-used Bob Balaban for the ride, along with Jean Dujardin (given short shrift here) and Hugh Bonneville. <br/><br/>Clooney is not going for WWII epic (Damon should have some déjà vu watching the Normandy sequence, though we're never shown him land either in 'Saving..' or in this one) evidenced by his setting the tone multiple times during the flick, with no grandstanding or bravado diverting the mission-at-hand, though the clunky voice- over by his character feels shoehorned, and we could have done without it. <br/><br/>Do I wish it had been more rousing, as more critics seemed to be expecting. Actually, no. Low-key is Clooney's style, and he's picked that up from Soderbergh, Corbjin and the like; and is his strength. There have been too many movies that go the epic route, and this is a welcome pace even for the genre itself, so that it doesn't feel tired and wear itself out (IMHO). <br/><br/>All in all, a good time at the movies, but only for those who synchronize their expectations accordingly. And yes, on the big screen - the production design merits that."
"bkoganbing","9","8","14","24 February 2014"," The ornaments of civilization
","If one doubts the importance of those people called The Monuments Men in saving nothing less than the ornaments of civilization I would commend them to read some ancient history. What Adolph Hitler had was a two fold aim. A museum where he could house the stolen beauty of his conquered countries and view it for himself and his chosen elite. And to destroy the accomplishments of his conquered peoples so that only that what was deemed Nazi acceptable should survive. Remember what the Romans did to the civilization of Carthage. All we know about it is from the view of their conquerors. It's what Hitler ultimately intended.<br/><br/>George Clooney gets a special commission from FDR after he sells the idea of a picked crew of art historians to go in and try to save as much as they could. All in all I'd say that Clooney and his team which consisted of Matt Damon, Bob Balaban, John Goodman, Dimitri Leonidas, Jean Dujardin, and Hugh Bonneville went into harm's way in their mission. They had to persuade our side to let them do their work and not interfere with the war. And the married Matt Damon manages to mix a little pleasure with business with Cate Blanchett who worked at the Louvre and told them what to look for and a general idea where to look. <br/><br/>The Monuments Men is a wonderful film about a little known, but vital mission in World War II. Vital because these men and women were trying to preserve what our civilization is all about."

","In this day and age where so much emphasis is put on sex, special effects, and foul language, it was refreshing to watch a movie without any of those criteria. Although it lacked historic accuracy, it was still in my opinion a well done production. I thought the actors did an excellent job portraying the characters who the movie was based on. I also liked the fact that there was a certain amount of humor laced into a few scenes to keep it from being more of a documentary type film. On top of the humor, there was also an element of surprise, both when you were not expecting it, as well as when you were, but getting a different type of outcome. Overall, I'd say that even though Hollywood took liberties with the facts, they still made an enjoyable movie, and one they can be proud of."

I especially liked Cate Blanchett's performance as the woman who eventually gave the soldiers the information they needed. She portrayed a hesitant woman in a dangerous time - she knew her life was in danger if found out and was careful about saying anything. The unlikely group, with little military knowledge were at times comical but always believable. The mission they were given was so important for the art world and the individuals the art was stolen from. If it weren't for these men we would not be able to enjoy the Madonna and Child by Michelangelo, the many paintings in the Lourve and families would not have been reunited with their paintings. At times the movie seemed a little slow, but the acting is well done and the history lesson is important for all. Hitler had instructed for all the collections to be destroyed if he lost the war - we have many reasons to be thankful to these Monument Men."

And while they told us why they need to save the art was so compelling they failed to really show it, to me at least. It seems like a common problem with ""star ensemble"" movies.

It shows the importance of art in civilization. During the war, Hitler had his Nazis Stormtroopers confiscate any valuable art work that they came across in their march across Europe. It seems that Hitler wanted to build a Fuhrer Museum and wanted to stock it with only the best pieces. When the war started turning against him, he gave an order to destroy all of the art work, if he was to die. George was an art historian that went to President Roosevelt with his plan to go in and save as many of the masterpieces as possible. Matt, Bill and John are some of the men that he gathered to go into Germany, shortly after the Normandy Invasion. Like George, they were not military men but engineers and museum directors. Cate worked in a French museum, during the German occupancy, and could help identify certain art pieces. During their treasure hunts, George and his men discovered something unexpected that helped shorten the war. FYI: at the very end of the movie, keep an eye out for the actor that plays George, as an older man. He is George's real life father, Nick. It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence and smoking and has a running time of 1 hour & 58 minutes.

","I must not forget to trust the February dumping ground. Be warned, The Monuments Men is a film to be endured, not enjoyed. I remember about a year ago we all thought this was a surefire frontrunner at the Oscars to head American Hustle and The Wolf of Wall Street. While the other two secured nominations but probably not awards, I'm glad this one didn't make the cut. Who could blame us? George Clooney was on top of the world having just one an Oscar and he's got two more spots on his mantle to fill, maybe another for Screenplay. Unfortunately his writing talents just don't cut the mustard. It's a total mess. It can't juggle its characters, but it doesn't give them anything to play with. It spends its time trying to justify itself, repeating monologues about why art is important to mankind that we heard in the trailers and they kinda work. They're the only engaging part of the movie really, saying why they did what did. It's just that how they did what they did isn't the least bit interesting. Once the characters are inexplicably on a dangerous path without much objection they face aimless inconsequential obstacles that don't really develop character or display their resourcefulness.<br/><br/>Every moment just feels terribly contrived. Forced scenes of conflict resolution such as Bill Murray smoking with a man until he leaves or Jean Dujardin finding that a sniper is a child. It feels like such an afterthought. I feel bad for the great talent in the cast because they mostly just irritated me every time they opened their mouths. Cate Blanchett does make the most of her character which is good to see considering she had the one at biggest risk of being ridiculous. If the film isn't dragging (I went to the bathroom when I didn't even have to go and I never usually leave a screening unless it's an emergency) then it's pure sentimental saccharine out of nowhere just to try and pull a reaction from the audience. I hoped the film could get by on charm, but its mean-spirited sense of humour just left a sour taste in my mouth. Although the production design is commendable, given its theme of art, it's disappointing to say that the cinematography is incredibly unimaginative. I hope one day Clooney can deliver something with the integrity of Good Night, and Good Luck. It's not terribly incompetent, it's just misguided and lifeless.

"jadepietro","Null","5","8","12 February 2014"," Far from Monumental
","This film is not recommended.<br/><br/>The Monuments Men tells the supposedly true story of a group of art lovers who fought to preserve the world's art treasures from the Nazis during World War II. Their on-going battle for acceptance from fellow Army officers and soldiers and their dangerous assignment takes them behind enemy lines and becomes the centerpiece for the film and its acting ensemble. This platoon of quirky artsy types join forces to accomplish their mission: rescue and retrieve art masterpieces and return them safely to their owners. The NEA would certainly gives its seal of approval and probably provide funding. I, on the other hand, found the film to be, shall I say, serviceable and competent.<br/><br/>Directed, written, and starring George Clooney, The Monuments Men takes this actual event and trivializes its significance by making it a predictable World World II melodramatic film that John Wayne would wholeheartedly endorse. Clooney plays Frank Stokes, an art historian and connoisseur of the finer things in life, a role perfectly suited for the actor. Stokes assembles a squadron of talented American aesthetes skilled in their own particular field of expertise: James Granger (Matt Damon), Richard Campbell (Bill Murray), Walter Garfield (John Goodman) and Preston Savitz (Bob Balaban). He also adds to the mix one Briton, Donald Jeffries (Hugh Bonneville), one Frenchman named Jean Claude Clermont (Jean Dujardin), and a Parisian mademoiselle / translator / love interest, Claire Simone (Cate Blanchett) to lend more international flavor and fervor to the cause. Needless to say, the names of these characters have been changed to protect the real-life heroes. The actors involved with this project should have asked for a nom de plume clause in their contract as well. All try their best to add some depth to their sketchy characters and have done better work than seen here. <br/><br/>There are some snags along the way, both in the film's plot and its execution. The film's major flaw is its script, co-authored by Clooney and Grant Heslov. It follows a throughly conventional formula with its one-dimensional types substituted for well-drawn characters who rarely resemble their real-life counterparts. (A romance between Simone and Granger is based on pure fiction.) The film is choppy and episodic as it jumps from one encounter to the next. Too many scenes consist of endless speeches decrying the weightiness of art, its cultural legacy, and America's stoicism above all else. It's as if the filmmakers need to convince themselves and their movie-going audience the significance of these brave men and their saintly quest. The Monuments Men constantly overstates their cause and effect.<br/><br/>But this is old-fashioned Hollywood movie-making, a patriotic crowd-pleasing throwback to a slice of American heroics of long ago. We've seen this all so many times before in better war dramas from the 60's. (Films like The Longest Day, The Guns of Navarone, The Train, The Dirty Dozen, and The Great Escape easily come to mind and are superior films worth multiple viewings. This film is not.) Production values remain strong and its period details are fine, the only exception being the usually reliable Alexandre Desplat and his intrusive and annoying film score that becomes a self-parody of war movie musical clichés.<br/><br/>￼The Monuments Men is informative and entertaining, but it never rises to the degree of exciting or memorable. Far from monumental, The Monuments Men becomes a mere footnote in the annuals of art and cinematic history. Their valiant story deserves better.

","""Monuments Men"" tries and mostly succeeds to tread a line that draws a cautionary balance between the epic loss of human life during World War II and the collateral loss and outright theft of priceless, historical artworks by the defeated Nazi's through the war's end. ""Men"" depicts the real-life mission of a group of art specialists to find and retrieve these stolen pieces.<br/><br/>""Men"" is a war tale told outside the confines of war in what may be a too-subtle attempt to draw out the inherent irony of abstracting war in art's context. ""Men"" depicts the trailing end of World War II only in that abstract sense, and to its own detriment arguably makes the process of finding the secreted artworks easier than it could possibly have been in reality. <br/><br/>There is an unevenness in ""Monuments Men"" that only marginally detracts from its overall quality. When Frank Stokes (George Clooney) meets up with Joseph Granger (Matt Damon) early in the planning stages of their art retrieval task, its hard not to expect at least one solid in-joke from their team-up in the famed ""Oceans"" film series - yet none comes. ""Men"" succeeds, however, in its own awareness of the danger and moral propriety in sending military men on a mission to retrieve artworks in the midst of the emerging reality of Nazi genocide. <br/><br/>""Men"" is a good, if flawed, film, telling a difficult tale that had to be harder to accomplish in reality than was depicted on screen. Its flaws are in uneven pacing, mismatched musical support, and a too-simple story; yet even amid these flaws, it conveys a valid story about still more heartbreaking loss in the midst of war. IT's worth your consideration."
"tieman64","Null","3","4","10 November 2014"," Because earth without art is just ""eh""
","George Clooney directs ""The Monuments Men"". The plot? Clooney plays Frank Stokes, a Lieutenant in the United States Army tasked with assembling a team of soldiers, museum curators and art historians. Their mission? Proceed into Nazi occupied France and rescue precious works of art from the hands of looting Germans.<br/><br/>Like Clooney's 2008 film, ""The Leatherheads"", ""The Monuments Men"" is an attempted throwback to Old Hollywood. Unfortunately the result is dull, shapeless and populated by tired, ageing actors, all of whom look like they wish to be elsewhere. Clooney casts Bill Murray and John Goodman, hoping that the duo might provide a little comedic spark, but no luck. Everyone's on life support.<br/><br/>Elsewhere the film disgorges familiar WW2 mythology. Here Americans are the ultimate saviours of European lives and culture, rather than architects of wanton destruction and global looting campaigns of their own. Along these lines the film functions as a dramatically inept version of ""Saving Private Ryan"", another men-on-a-mission movie which specialised in bulldozing history. The straw-man of ""Saving Private Ryan's"" final sequence, in which civilians are asked whether they've ""earned the sacrifices of dead soldiers"", is even replicated in ""The Monuments Men"". Here we're asked whether any work of art is ever worth a soldier's life. ""Yeah,"" an elderly man replies for us. The answer is not just creepy, but obfuscates the larger realities of war and soldiering, which oft have little to do with lofty ideals; only lies need constant veneration.<br/><br/>And so by its final act, it becomes clear that Clooney intends ""The Monuments Men"" to be a giant love letter to art. Art, the film argues, is ""very important"", and so by extension movies too (and we actors as well!). Such a stance is fine, but in the context of WW2's killing fields, nevertheless wholly conceited. This narcissism perfectly echoes most Greatest Generation mythology.<br/><br/>4/10 – See John Frankenheimer's ""The Train"", an excellent ""art heist"" flick, also set at the height of World War 2. See too ""Kelly's Heroes"", ""Decision Before Dawn"" and Sydney Pollack's underrated ""Castle Keep"", also about wartime art preservation."

The cast all perform as if they would rather be elsewhere, much as I felt immediately after the opening credits. It's impossible to believe that anyone involved with this mess did not realize that they were creating a debacle of epic proportions. Clooney deserves the triple crown for this piece of garbage.... the direction is film school dropout quality, the script could have been created by the proverbial million monkeys with a million typewriters, and his acting skills are the equal of a typical high school junior star doing a bad Clark Gable imitation."

","There's something almost refreshingly old-fashioned about ""The Monuments Men,"" one of those Very Important Pictures that Hollywood used to produce with such abundance in its heyday. It's one of those World War II pictures in which a motley group of strangers is recruited by the United States Army to carry out a mission behind enemy lines. Dubbed the Monuments Men, this group of art experts was assigned the task of rescuing some of the world's greatest art masterpieces from the grasping hands of the Nazis who were busily absconding with the works with the intention of displaying them in a museum of their own after the war. <br/><br/>Lt. Frank Stokes, who spearheaded the mission, is portrayed by George Clooney, while the men he recruits are played by Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Jean Dujardin, Bib Balaban, Dimitri Leonidas and Hugh Bonneville (""Downton Abbey""). Cate Blanchett co-stars as a curator who is also a Resistance fighter working for the French Underground, and who is initially suspicious of the Monuments Men's motives for rounding up the treasures.<br/><br/>The movie is interesting enough as an unusual slice of history, I suppose, but the screenplay by Clooney and Grant Heslov, based on the book by Robert M. Edsel, never finds a way to make this true life tale come alive as drama. The characters are dull and under-developed, and, as a consequence, we find ourselves strangely uninterested in their back stories and unmoved by their fates. There is also way too much emphasis placed on the comical and the sentimental, and the movie comes replete with a gratingly frivolous score that seems woefully inappropriate to the subject at hand.<br/><br/>Despite the all-star cast, the movie is weighed down by over-earnest acting, with Murray and Balaban seemingly on hand mainly for the comic relief they provide. <br/><br/>Clooney has directed the film with hollow competence, and there's some discussion about whether or not lives should be risked for the sake of inanimate objects, no matter how valuable, but it's hard to make anything particularly memorable out of a story where the artwork has more personality than the players."

Sadly, the public is taken to the cleaners. This is a truly bad movie.

The end of the movie was somewhat better, tied together properly at least. The acting was mostly very flat. While I have seen both Clooney and Daemon give good performances, these performances had no nuances. It was as if they were hanging out in their every day lives. Neither played a character that seemed very different from the persona that they project as themselves. And While Cate Blanchett actually DID give her character nuances, she was so unpleasant that I didn't care to watch her.

","""If you destroy their achievements, their history, it's like they never existed.""<br/><br/>When I heard George Clooney was going to direct a film about a World War II platoon tasked by Roosevelt to rescue art masterpieces, and that Matt Damon, Bill Murray, Cate Blanchett, Jean Dujardin, and John Goodman were all going to co-star with him, I was sure it was going to win all kinds of awards and was highly anticipating it. Then when the film release was changed to February my expectations for it lowered tremendously, so I wasn't expecting much from The Monuments Men by the time I went to see it. This allowed me to actually enjoy the film a bit more despite the fact that it didn't come close to reaching its potential. It's a slow building film based on a true historic and important event, and the film doesn't stop reminding us of this fact considering it keeps on stating its self importance through the main characters. The film felt forced during those scenes where we were constantly reminded why the mission was so important and worth the human sacrifice. Despite failing in its grand ambitions and never quite figuring out the tone of the film, it's still worth seeing for the great cast. There were also several scenes that stood out in this war picture that included some comedy, but overall the film felt incomplete at times missing something. The word disappointment comes to mind considering how much potential The Monuments Men had, but it was still entertaining despite some of the misfires in Clooney's film.<br/><br/>The script was adapted by George Clooney and Grant Heslov from Robert Edsel's book about the world's greatest treasure hunt in history. Frank Stokes (George Clooney) is tasked by President Roosevelt to form a platoon with the mission of going into Germany and rescuing art masterpieces from the Nazis who had stolen them from their owners (mostly Jewish collectors) for Hitler's collection. Frank quickly forms a team of seven guys consisting of museum directors, curators, and art historians with very little experience in war. The Monuments Men, as they called themselves, was conformed by Frank, James Granger (Matt Damon), Richard Campbell (Bill Murray), Walter Garfield (John Goodman), Jean Claude Clermont (Jean Dujardin), Donald Jeffries (Hugh Bonneville), and Preston Savitz (Bob Balaban). Despite their little military experience they began a race against time in order to rescue these valuable art pieces and return them to their owners before Hitler destroyed them all.<br/><br/>There are some fun moments in The Monuments Men thanks in most part to the incredible cast, but one can't help and think about how underused they were. The characters were all very poorly developed and they only served to move along the story. I still can recall several funny scenes that were enough for me personally to watch and recommend this film. It's too bad the movie never manages to deliver the importance of the subject matter despite repeating the message constantly. I don't think it did these men justice for their contribution to humanity, but at least we got to know their story and enjoy a light hearted film about them."

","Here is a film that could have moved us, inspired us, catapulted a new angle to Historical events in ways we couldn't even imagine. Instead, we're treated to one movie that is at best sketchy, sort of half baked pastry, a raw steak, a wall with barely a coat of paint and plenty to complete. There is a good cast, an interesting story that is never fully developed, and one Desplat's laziest musical scores, full of musical clichés, and half-hearted military themes. One can't help referring to classic gems. Here sets look like sets, costumes never quite feel or look realistic... The only thing that looks real are the pieces of art, and yes, there is an actor that not even this film can bring down, Ms. Blanchett. She earns once again great marks for putting what little soul is in the movie. She is the only character who really seems to care about the pieces of art. Others talk about saving them. She is the only one who puts passion in her delivery, her acting, her looks. She transforms herself into an important piece of the puzzle. It's just too bad the rest of the pieces don't fit.<br/><br/>We follow a special squad as they try to rescue thousands of pieces of art that Hittler has appropriated as he conquers most of Europe. It's a race against time because if they don't find those artworks, they might be destroyed and lost forever. Our heroes are not quite prepared for some of the tasks, and soon tragedy strikes, making them realize this might be too much to handle.<br/><br/>It's a pity that there is little heart in the movie, and that no matter how handsome the troop looks, the bad guys show up a couple of times, shoot them, burn a few paintings, and threaten to make things worse. It's amazing they are representatives of one of the worst embodiments of evil civilization has ever seen. There is also a bothersome tone to the film. It feels like this has a tongue in cheek attitude that doesn't quite fit. This is serious stuff, and that angle is at best not very respectful.<br/><br/>Maybe someone will remake it soon, and we will get a better presentation of an interesting part of history."

Its use is as bad as ""these athletes are expected to medal"". Phew!, now that I've got that off my chest I feel better. Apart from that minor script lapse,this wasn't a bad movie. It wasn't anything that would blow you away and there were really no memorable scenes but I didn't feel the need to storm out like some of the reviewers. I like George Clooney and he seems seems like a nice guy but he ain't no soldier. Matt Damon and Cate Blanchette played pretty good roles. John Goodman and Bill Murray were right on the edge of producing something fabulous but this story didn't allow them room. As for the guy who played Preston, well he is just the best , from the T.V executive on Seinfeld to just about any part I've seen him in since, Balaban has been superb. <br/><br/>I kept getting Sam Epstein mixed up with the star of Inside Llewyn Davies so I was dissing him in my mind, but he put in a solid performance. Like so many of the movies these days this was just a good TV show without the ads. TV shows from the cable companies are much better than anything that Hollywood turns out lately. To summarize, I think that Cate is showing what a superb actress she is in every new movie she appears in and she was the bright spot in this effort. I'm very hard to please, so don't stay home because of me, it is an enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours. Oh one more thing before I go ..

I viewed it on opening day with great expectations and came away thinking of it as only a curiosity, a tale with two possible aspects. First, I found it just another 1960's style WWII narrative with a slightly lighthearted American perspective to accompany its musical score. But upon further viewing more somber elements took over.<br/><br/>Based on certain historical facts, the script compels a certain suspension of disbelief. In the event, however, the facts as presented seem not only fragmented, but interpreted across the board so as to make heroes of several very ordinary guys trying to do an impossible job: namely, dispelling horrors of war by making sure objets d'art survived intact.

It's fun seeing all these brilliant actors in one film, the comedy is good, the story has a nice moral and all together I liked it. I've hear people say it's boring but I wasn't bored at all, the pacing inst fast, and there aren't particularly any 'action scenes' but it's by no means boring. The way the film is put together I thought was a little strange, the first half felt like a series of sketches mixed with a very dramatic story of World War horror; about half way through it got much better but you did get the odd scene which added nothing to the story but gave you a good laugh, which I did.

The Story about a group of People, trying to Return some of the most important Pieces of Art in European History, to there rightful Owners is great. It's Characters Motivations are believable, those people weren't just some Art-Crazy Nutjobs that risked their lives to Save some Paintings they've only saw in Books, it goes deeper. I give this Movie Credit for not being an over-the-top patriotic WW II Flick. It's big Problem is, that it can't decide which kind of movie it's trying to be. Is it supposed to be a serious Drama or a Comedy with some serious Moments. And if you cast a Actor like Bill Murray, i would've expected a Comedy. So we get a mix of Dramatic Scenes, a few funny Scenes and unfunny Scenes which were supposed to be funny. On top of that, this movie is not good edited. Early in the Film the Group splits into several Groups, so the movie keeps switching between these Groups, which makes it sometimes hard to follow the Plot. Sometimes the time Gap between the cuts are crazy. In one scene we are in France during Autumn, then they cut and next they show us a scene in deepest Winter during the Battle of the Bulge. For all i can see, the acting is good, but because i watched the German-dubbed Version of this movie i can't fully Judge the acting. Now, is this movie horrible? Well, no it got some weak Moments and some strong Moments. When this movie was was over i thought to myself ""this movie was OK"". But maybe that's the Problem it's just OK."

","There is a good chance Saving Private Ryan ruined World War II movies for the rest of eternity because of its sheer realism and ability to not hold any of the carnage and insanity back.<br/><br/>The Monuments Men's biggest issue is having to follow up to a masterpiece (that all war movies nowadays strive to become) with the similar credentials of covering an isolated incident that takes place in the middle of the deadliest war in modern history. Just like in Saving Private Ryan, Monuments Men is about preserving history before it gets swept up by the devastating conflict that leveled Eurasia. Private Ryan concerns pitting strangers together to save someone they don't know to prevent a family line from disappearing forever. With Monuments, it's about preserving art and culture before that gets permanently leveled by a war.<br/><br/>World War II is never a fun subject, no matter which way you look at it. Even at its most entertaining, the usually humorously dark Tarantino kept Inglorious Basterds on check with its grim content. Having more humor than drama and suspense in the middle of such a sad time period with the threat always imminent makes for an awkward watch. Monuments Men never pretends to be a comedy, but the entire movie feels unfocused as Bill Murray (He doesn't have an Oscar yet..hmmm) throws one-liners centimeters away from death—with impending Nazi danger around the corner.<br/><br/>And despite the stellar cast with decent performances (John Goodman and Cate Blanchett deserving some extra credit), despite the good cinematography and usual good direction from Hollywood staple George Clooney, the movie feels very by-the-numbers, paint-within-the-lines. It follows all the credentials, it checks off everything in the clichéd checklist for an inspiring historical drama. You have the likable characters, the necessary poetic deaths, and the uplifting ending in the midst of the odds being stacked against our heroes. So what else is there? The movie plays far too safe. And sometimes safe limits the impact. Saving Private Ryan leaves you numb, leaves you appreciating life, and leaves you desperately searching for good news during the two hours of intense filmmaking. Monuments Men never delivers an impactful emotional punch, even with the incredible true story that could have spawned a mini-series of some sort.<br/><br/>Clooney is like that cool student that is smarter than he leads on, can strive for that A+. But with his latest film, he doesn't really aim for the A+, instead settling for the B grade with the PG-13 content in an environment that is anything but. And with that, the movie feels like a C. Watchable, but ultimately forgettable."
"churchofsunshine","6","7","13","17 February 2014"," Not as bad as many critics would have you believe.
","I saw this on the second day of its opening weekend in the UK. The cinema screen was only about a quarter full. That surprised me. Maybe people had been put off by the lukewarm reviews by the critics. Maybe George Clooney isn't just much of a draw at the box office any more. Maybe people just don't want to see a film about ""art"". Maybe everybody else in Preston was up at Deepdale paying their respects to Sir Tom Finney. Perhaps it was a little bit of all of the above.<br/><br/>I consider myself fairly well informed when it comes to World War 2, but I have to say that although I know that the Nazis looted loads of art from all across the continent, I never knew that the real-life 'Monument Men' existed - people who's job it was to try and locate all this missing artwork, get it back, and return it to their rightful owners. To this day of course, the search for pilfered art from WW2 is ongoing. How much of this film is true and how much is fiction is open to question. The real 'Monuments Men' were of course much more than platoon strength - in the film we are told there were just eight (led on-screen by Clooney, who also wrote and directed), in reality there were a few hundred. Some of the characters are apparently loosely based on real people, but their names have been changed. A bit like ""The Great Escape"" in that regard. For example, for Cate Blanchett's character (Claire Simone) you should Google 'Rose Valland' for information on the real person her character was based on.<br/><br/>The film was good enough to hold my interest, but I can't say it blew me away, and I don't see it getting anywhere at next years Oscars. I will try and obtain a copy of the book on which this film is based, as I thought the actual story is quite interesting, probably much more so than the film. The way I see it, George Clooney has educated me that these people existed, now I will deliberately forget what I have just seen and read the truth instead!

","Don't go to ""The Monuments Men"" expecting to see a flippant WWII ""Ocean's Fourteen."" It's deliciously entertaining, but deeper than that. Though George Clooney is leading an all-star crew through a daring heist — rescuing occupied Europe's greatest art treasures from the Nazis — this is a sturdy, old-school, big-scale Greatest Generation war movie. It's great escapism.<br/><br/>The unlikely story is about true-life heroism, not irony. It's frequently funny yet earnest at heart. Directing, starring and co-writing, Clooney honors unheralded men who made a crucial contribution to the war for civilization. It's a story about men risking lives to save Western culture's greatest achievements from brutes who saw books and timeless art as tinder and kindling.<br/><br/>The stakes are clear from the opening scene, with Da Vinci's wall mural ""The Last Supper"" near collapse after an Allied bombing raid on Milan in 1943 reduced the refectory housing it to rubble.<br/><br/>""The Monuments Men"" follows the fictional characters of art conservationist Frank Stokes (Clooney) and museum director James Granger (Matt Damon) as they recruit a half-dozen artists and experts to preserve masterworks. The squad includes Bill Murray as an architect, John Goodman as a sculptor, Bob Balaban as a theater impresario and Jean Dujardin as a French resistance fighter.<br/><br/>They're an odd lot, gifted and flawed, and they don't always get along with each other or their pragmatic GI counterparts. The film doesn't squander a lot of time building background stories for them. With iconic faces and talents like these, that's unnecessary. Goodman conveys more with the twitch of an eye than pages of dialogue can tell, and the comic friction between Murray and Balaban is as sly as anything in a Christopher Guest movie. These actors have a sense of identity from the get-go.<br/><br/>The film looks stupendous, with Normandy Beach, Paris, snow-covered Belgian forests, castles and cathedrals gloriously photographed by Phedon Papamichael. The olive drab and gray of the military equipment and uniforms offer a striking contrast to the beautiful jewel tones of the art on display.<br/><br/>Most of the artwork in peril features religious subject matter, a canny choice on Clooney's part. It's shorthand for the way art inspires and enriches our daily lives, and for most viewers it carries deeper emotional associations than secular works by Vermeer or Rembrandt.<br/><br/>Cate Blanchett throbs with suppressed rage as a Paris curator forced into cooperation with Nazi art looters. She'd be executed on the spot if they realized she was secretly cataloging the destinations of national treasures being carted away for display in Hitler's proposed Führer Museum. To recapture that beauty — there are worse reasons to risk your life. Her ardor helps convince even skeptics that there's more than canvas and paint and chiseled stone at stake here.<br/><br/>The film is episodic, and it could have been stronger with a centerpiece conflict between the old, out-of-shape scholars and a nemesis. Even so, it's strong work, with a sense of the capricious ebb and flow of history. The offhand way the squad learns that the war has ended is a delightful throwaway.<br/><br/>The film's emotional peak hits at a time, and in a way, you're unprepared for. While a medic (played by Clooney's co-writer Grant Heslov) works on a gravely wounded soldier, Murray hears a homemade recording of his grandchildren singing ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas"" over the camp PA system. At moments like that, and during the touching cameo appearance by Clooney's father, Nick, you know you're watching one straight from the heart. And that's right where it hits you."

Practically every member of its astounding cast could carry his or her own film, and George Clooney has gained a reputation in recent years for crafting solid, intelligent, powerful films that are easy favourites on the awards circuit. Then, the first sign of trouble appeared on the horizon: the film's release date was changed from a Christmas 2013 slot (prime positioning for the Oscars) to February this year (effectively eliminating it from the competition). The delay was ostensibly because the film's visual effects were more complicated than anticipated. But the speculation began nonetheless: Clooney had somehow managed to muck it up.<br/><br/>That's perhaps why critics have generally reacted so negatively to the film since its release: if Clooney is waving a white flag of surrender, what right has The Monuments Men to be much good? Sky-high expectations were immediately transmuted into long-suffering derision: Clooney's film, it's been argued, is poorly structured, annoyingly episodic, and tonally inconsistent, hopping between comedy and tragedy without achieving much success on either front. If most critics are to be believed, Clooney has completely wasted this golden opportunity - not to mention the cast of a lifetime.<br/><br/>What's comforting about watching the actual film is discovering that The Monuments Men is, on the whole, a great deal better than the extremes of expectation and opinion would suggest. It's not a full-on classic by any stretch of the imagination, but neither is it a monumental disappointment. For what it has chosen to be, it's very good: a look at the quieter side of war, at a battle fought for the soul of humanity - as captured in its artistic achievements - that is full of hope, but also grieves for the losses the world suffered as a result of World War II.<br/><br/>Inspired by true events, the film opens on Lt. Frank Stokes (Clooney), a Harvard professor trying desperately hard to convince President Roosevelt of the need to thwart Adolf Hitler on a non-military front. Invaluable works of art across Europe are being systematically stolen by the Nazis as part of Hitler's plan to build a Führer Museum of his very own. Stokes gets the go-ahead to form the Monuments Men: a rag-tag group of museum directors, curators and art historians, whose sworn mission is to uncover Hitler's smuggling operation and recover the stolen artworks before they disappear forever - or are destroyed come the end of the war.<br/><br/>Once assembled, the Monuments Men fan out across Europe. Lt. James Granger (Matt Damon) heads to Paris to get the help of Claire Simone (Cate Blanchett), a rebellious, devoted curator keeping watch as the Nazis blithely pilfer art in occupied Paris. Sgt. Richard Campbell (Bill Murray) and Private Preston Savitz (Bob Balaban) go on the hunt for Hubert van Eyck's multi-panelled Ghent Altarpiece, while Sgt. Walter Garfield (John Goodman) and Lt. Jean-Claude Clermont (Jean Dujardin) get caught in the crossfire of battle while hunting down leads.<br/><br/>There's certainly quite a bit of truth in saying that The Monuments Men suffers somewhat from patchy, episodic plotting. The film occasionally drifts from moment to moment, some of its logic unravelling the longer you think about it. (After Granger is rebuffed by Claire a few times, what does he actually do in Paris?) There's a climactic scene in which Lt. Donald Jeffries (Downton Abbey's Hugh Bonneville) fights to keep Michelangelo's exquisite Madonna and Child statue out of Nazi hands - but it's so choppily edited together that audiences might find themselves puzzled about what exactly happened.<br/><br/>But The Monuments Men is also a real delight: a movie about war that brims over with hope and humanity, while never losing sight of the very real horrors and consequences of heading into battle. The film's many moments of sweet, gentle levity - Granger's clumsy attempts to speak French (wonderfully subtitled on screen), Campbell and Savitz bickering but also coming to understand each other - are balanced out by the heartache and sacrifices of these Monuments Men. These are men - and one woman - who could easily have sat out the war, most of them too old to be enlisted. And yet, here they are, in the trenches of a very specific fight that not many will understand, but which everybody will eventually come to appreciate.<br/><br/>This is where Clooney's starry cast shines the brightest. They help him carry the film, turning their tiny pockets of screen-time into something more, something deeper. Murray nails all his comedy bits, of course, particularly when he's strapped into a dentist's chair - but he will break your heart when he listens to a phonograph from home, one which also serves to literally underscore the darkest, saddest sacrifice the war requires of young, able-bodied men. Clooney himself manages to sell a few overly stirring, inspirational speeches about the hallowed mission of these Monuments Men. Damon and Blanchett, too, make magic out of their scenes together - her Claire, in particular, is a marvel of strength and determination, unflinching around Nazi scum and in the face of direct gunfire, only slightly undone by the awkward hint of romance that sneaks into the script.<br/><br/>To be honest, it's easy to pick apart The Monuments Men - it's not as tightly woven or as well-paced as it could be, its characters often relying more on their actors than the script for a little depth and complexity. It's heavy-handed and light-hearted, all at once. But that's also part of the film's considerable charm: it credibly pushes a message of unyielding optimism in the face of crushing odds and Nazi efficiency, one that's threaded through with a bittersweet, rich vein of humour. For all its flaws, The Monuments Men clearly demonstrates how the greatest of exigencies can produce as much hope as they can horror."
"hgwellsusa","7","7","14","9 February 2014"," Important To Attention To The Monuments Men
","Too bad the movie has had such poor reviews. The story of the Monuments Men itself is interesting. I'm looking forward to a related book, The Noble Sculptor (web site by the same name), that's coming out that. It has a dovetailed WWII story of that time. That one is partly a story of one of the Monuments Men in Italy. But its really about that Monuments Man's father, a hero during WWII at the time. He put himself at risk and was credited with saving over 600 Allied troops trying to escape the Germans in Italy. That sounds like a great movie to me and I can't help but thinking about missing elements in seeing The Monuments Men.<br/><br/>Really if, as I do, you love decent movies generally, The Monuments Men is fine. Its basic importance is that it has brought attention to previously little known (unless one read the book) men and women who did something that no one else did – and that needed to be done. It was part of saving culture and history. That makes it an important movie if for no other reason. If one goes to judge all movies by award standards, then the vast majority will fail. <br/><br/>Although I know other stories as movies can and do end up being as good or better (i.e.: The Noble Sculptor), The Monuments Men is not as bad as some reviews have you think. It comes down to expectations and, in some cases, biases.<br/><br/>Some will simply see the movie because they like John Goodman or George or one of the other actors. It's like seeing a John Wayne movie. If you like John Wayne, it doesn't matter what he's in. Many people will enjoy the movie just watching the cast do what it does. Relax and don't over-analyze it."

"Likes_Ninjas90","2","5","9","11 March 2014"," For a film so boastful about preserving history, it seems all too content to commercialise its own story
","One of the many problems with George Clooney's new film The Monuments Men is that he only identifies his characters by either their star power or their occupation. As the writer, producer, director and star, Clooney has summoned an embarrassingly rich cast but doesn't test them. Seven actors including himself, Bill Murray, Jean Dujardin, Matt Damon, Bob Balaban, John Goodman and Hugh Bonneville, form the Monuments Men. Cate Blanchett also stars as Claire Simone, a French curator. The men are creative types and art experts who are assigned during WWII to reclaim art stolen by the Nazis and Adolf Hitler and to restore it. These characters are established with minimal context, so no one fully dissolves into their characters or belongs to the period. It cynically asks us to be blindsided and dazzled by the actors alone. Their performances lack intensity. You have never seen a more jovial group of blokes in a war zone. Cate Blanchett underlines the film's glaring disregard for authenticity in favour of celebrity because in spite of her efforts, she still isn't French. For a film so boastful about preserving history, it seems all too content to commercialise its own story. <br/><br/>The mediocrity is surprising because I have enjoyed the films George Clooney and Grant Heslov have written together (The Ides of March and Good Night and Good Luck). Heslov also directed Clooney in The Men Who Stare At Goats, which was hilarious. Co-writing a screenplay together from Robert M. Edsel's book, this is their weakest film so far. Until now all their films have sustained a subtext about the ugliness of political warfare. The Monuments Men is political as well but also transparent and too self-important to realise it. It's about the men who fought to save art! At the very least, this is a true story. The real Monuments Men belonged to the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives, which was made up of more than three hundred people, both men and women, from over a dozen different nations. They were tasked with recovering stolen art but also minimising the amount of damage done to historical buildings from the bombing of the Allies. By protecting art and property, five million objects were returned to their countries of origin. Dr. Nigel Pollard from Swansea University said while he enjoyed the film, he felt it reduced the importance of the British involvement by focussing mostly on American characters. <br/><br/>Clooney and Heslov's script doesn't compensate for its historical inaccuracies. Along with the thin characterisation, the narrative substitutes new, insightful thematic ideas for clichés about personal sacrifice, dedication and male bonding. If you're still awake, the notion of the Monuments Men being passive and non-violent towards their enemies because they are not ordinary soldiers is interesting but not persistent enough. The narrative is overly fragmented, divided into multiple subplots so there isn't a clear central character or development arc for the rest of the team, who are already underwritten. Major historical events like Normandy and the Battle of the Bulge are treated like fleeting episodes without conflict between the group and a sense of danger. Someone felt that in order to market the film with the same jokiness as Clooney's Ocean's Eleven films the amount of carnage had to be reduced. The Monuments Men obviously weren't exclusive to casualties in the war but there is little sense of the widespread damage of the war. The insulation of the film's scenarios defeats the point of what the real Monuments Men were trying to achieve and what they had to prevent.<br/><br/>Behind the camera George Clooney does nothing to salvage his own screenplay because his direction lacks attention to detail. The pace is leaden and some set pieces are embarrassingly underpopulated and poorly constructed, like a gunfight in a ruined city that's essentially a ghost town, or an ambush from a group of Nazis hiding in the bushes. Clooney can't decide what the tone should be either. The film grasps at an awkward comedic lightness as we see these older, unfit men undertake basic training (how did John Goodman pass?) but then the sentiment is piled on with speechifying about sacrificing our boys' lives for the sake of art and culture. The movie feels terribly old fashioned and not in a complimentary way that supports an authenticated period rendering. Thankfully, George Clooney will survive because he is intelligent and capable of making films that are infinitely better than this. He has an easy task ahead of him."

With MM, we have one fantasy event after another that is forced to stand meekly on its own and falls flat on its face.<br/><br/>Clooney spends most of the time pontificating on how so important art is and that it is really more important than life. We hear this time and again. Other times this is some sort of road trip/buddy movie which wants to be taken lightly. George, it's one or the other. In the end, we get nothing but a very poorly done film This film was delayed in its opening and you will understand why. It is just very poorly done.<br/><br/>And heck, I know history and art. I've been to most of the settings of this film and seen much of the great art of Europe.

I can see that point. I felt like if art, history, or true stories don't appeal to you then stay away from this movie. If any of those three interest you then go see it. It was boring in a few spots but most movies do have their dry spells. The only reason this movie is torn apart is because it wasn't an action packed war movie. That is the reason why people aren't happy.

"3xHCCH","7","6","12","12 February 2014"," Saving the Legacy of Art
","""The Monuments Men"" gathers together such a stellar cast, it was definitely hard to ignore. George Clooney directs, writes and plays the lead role in a film that somehow echoes his Danny Ocean films. It was also about gathering a bunch of experts together for a common mission. But this time the mission was not a criminal heist, but something altogether noble and altruistic.<br/><br/>In the heat of World War 2, Frank Stokes (George Clooney) wanted to save the precious artwork that the Nazis are spiriting away from various European cities they are attacking. When his mission was approved, he gathered a group of seven experts in the arts together to help him recover these treasures from the clutches of Hitler. These men were not mere bystanders when they went to Europe for their mission. They were actually in the middle of all the risks and dangers of war. <br/><br/>George Clooney basically plays himself here, a charming man with a sense of humor and a noble mission in life. It is difficult to disengage him with this Danny Ocean persona, especially since Matt Damon is also on board the team here as James Granger, the curator of the Metropolitan Museum in New York. The chemistry between these two guys was undeniably effortless. The relationship of Damon's Granger with that of Cate Blanchett's Claire (who was the curator of a French museum) though, was rather awkwardly portrayed.<br/><br/>Bill Murray plays his usual deadpan droll self as architect Richard Campbell. His mission partner was theater director Preston Savitz, played by Bob Balaban. John Goodman was his usual good guy self as sculpture expert Walter Garfield. His mission partner was French painter Jean Claude Clermont, played by Jean Dujardin. Too bad that we do not really know much more about each of their individual backgrounds and expertise. It would have made us care about them more.<br/><br/>For a movie that deals with such an importantly serious topic, George Clooney decides to treat his material with a sense of humor. There would be plenty of funny little one-liners peppered throughout the script, many times diffusing the tension in very intense scenes. I could not help but imagine how it would have been if they had played this film in complete seriousness. This material had the potential to be another war classic and Oscar winner if treated as a drama. That said, the light comedic treatment makes the issue more accessible for younger viewers. There is still pathos that still shine through in many scenes.<br/><br/>There were several scenes that may feel extraneous, like Goodman and Dujardin's encounter with an unseen sniper, Damon's unfortunate dilemma when he accidentally stepped on a landmine, or even Murray's scene in the shower while a recording of his daughter singing a Christmas carol was played. These were not necessarily about saving art from the war. But they do complete the picture that these people, despite being there for a special non-military mission, were really still in the thick of the war experience.<br/><br/>The message of the film is important. Are works of art worth the cost of human life to preserve them? People who believe that the cultural achievements of humanity should be protected from the destruction of war at all cost, this film will definitely strike a positive chord. Those who believe that art is a mere triviality may think this film is much ado about nothing. I believe they are, and that is why I enjoyed this film very much despite its flaws. 7/10."
"The-Sarkologist","7","4","7","15 March 2014"," To the men who helped preserve our identity
","This I thought was a pretty good movie about a little known story of a group of men who played, in my opinion, a very important roll during World War II, and that was to save as much stolen art as possible and return it to its rightful owners. When the Nazi's occupied Europe they began taking art back to Germany to build a large museum to house it (one of the first casualties in war does tend to be artwork, and that is why there is a lot of art scattered across Europe – take the British Museum for instance that has artwork from places as diverse as Greece and Egypt). However, this was during the closing stages of the war, and it was evident that the Russians were also procuring the art and returning it to the Soviet Union, so it ended up becoming a race to get as much art back to the original owners as possible.<br/><br/>The two major pieces that they were pursuing in this movie was Michealangelo's Madonna and Child and the altar fact from the Cathedral at Ghent. A lot more art was recovered, and a lot still remains missing. It is saddening to know that the Nazi's actually torched a lot of the art that they held when it became evident that they were losing the war, however the Monument's Men did manage to save an extraordinary amount of artwork when it became clear that it was being hidden in places such as abandoned mines.<br/><br/>The theme about this movie is how art, and architecture, works to define our identity, and the saying that they can burn down our homes and kill us but we will still return but if our art is destroyed then our identity is lost holds true. In fact that is why a lot of buildings are listed as heritage buildings because these buildings define who we are as a nation. As we see developers swarming in and leveling suburbs to build apartments we can see our identity changing, but by retaining the older buildings means that we have a connection with our past and our identity is preserved."

Not to mention the fact that some extremely talented artists serving on the monuments men squad lost their lives, thereby depriving the world of any artistic contributions they may have made had they survived.<br/><br/>The acting - with the exception of clooney (who seems to only have one character no matter what movie he is in) is exceptional; I can't fault it at all. It's just such a shame that this same ensemble wasn't used for a better movie.<br/><br/>It is RIGHT that goods were recovered from the Nazis, but to suggest that this endeavour was in any way more important than human lives makes this a dark period in human understanding and not in any way entertaining to watch."

Not just famous and historical works of art from galleries and public buildings but all art, whomever may be the artist and whatever the subject, which belonged to ordinary people. This film although lighthearted in many parts serves well as a grim reminder of many things that went on during the war, no scene depicts this better than finding the barrels of wedding rings and gold fillings (it's OK I'm not giving anything away, that scene is in the trailer).

People stuck their necks out knowing full well that they could lose their head as a result, yet did it time and time again. An interesting group of people came together to form this platoon, from George Clooney, Matt Damon and Bill Murray to Hugh Bonneville and Jon Goodman, to name a few. A more unlikely group of heroes you could hardly think of, yet this team worked and this film worked. I'd like to watch it again. It's worth staying through the beginning of the credits as there are a number of real wartime photos depicting the art being found, this brings home the fact it's a true story."

","Greetings again from the darkness. Movies based on real life are often some of my favorites, but that doesn't let them off the hook in needing to be well made. The real life story of the Monuments Men provides both pride and heartbreak. This Allied group tracked down and rescued so much Nazi-stolen artwork, while at the same time being so short-staffed that they resorted to picking and choosing what parts of history and culture to save.<br/><br/>For much of 2013, this movie was mentioned as a possible Oscar contender. When the release date was delayed and Clooney admitted he was struggling with the film's tone - a balance of comedic and dramatic and historic elements - all the warning flags shot up. The final version would certainly have benefited from script improvement, though the cast is so strong and the mission so true, that the film is still enjoyable enough. Director George Clooney and co-writer Grant Heslov have adapted the source material from Robert M Edsel, but Clooney can't resist stamping the movie with his smirk appeal.<br/><br/>The actual Monument Men spend very little time together, so it's tough to call this an ensemble piece. Bill Murray and Bob Balaban have their own subtle comedy routine going, while John Goodman and Jean Dujardin enjoy a jeep ride. Matt Damon and Cate Blanchett add a dose of gratuitous love interest where it's not needed, and Hugh Bonneville strikes the heroic pose of redemption. Director Clooney ensures that actor Clooney and his buddy Damon get the most screen time and close-ups, detracting from what the real story should be ... the men who saved art and culture.<br/><br/>Michelangelo's Madonna of Bruges and Hubert van Eyck's Ghent Altarpiece are supposedly the centerpieces of this group's mission, but the film really is just an amalgam of individual scenes that leave the viewer working frantically to tie all the pieces together. Shouldn't that be the filmmaker's job? The question gets asked a couple of times, ""Is art worth a human life?"". That critical theme could have been the core of a far superior movie ... one not in desperate need of suspense rather than more punchlines.<br/><br/>Very few war projects have successfully blended comedy and drama. A few that come to mind are Kelly's Heroes, The Dirty Dozen and TV's ""Hogan's Heroes"". It's a tricky line to walk, even with a great cast. So while this one has sufficient entertainment value for a February release, I would rather recommend two others that deal with this same subject matter: The Rape of Europa (2007, documentary) and The Train (1964, directed by John Frankenheimer, starring Burt Lancaster)."

"ArtandJoyofMovies","Null","4","8","8 February 2014"," Great story, not a great movie
","An all-star cast. Great story. Obviously well acted. I admire George Clooney more every day. He is on my top five list of people I would love to have dinner with----though I suspect he and I would argue a lot. Kudos to George for making this story into a film. It should be admired. There was one problem. This was not a great movie.<br/><br/>The Monuments Men is an drama about some middle aged men being drafted into a World War II platoon to save great works of art threatened by Hitler and the Nazis. Think Space Cowboys (2000) meets Stripes without as much charm and humor.<br/><br/>My expectations were unfortunately huge for this film. It had been hyped more than Susan Rice pushed the "" Innocence of Muslims"" for causing the Benghazi massacre. The trailers have all the funny and interesting scenes. The rest is really a dramatic documentary, and for that, it has great value. TMG just walked out of the film feeling, ""okay, nice film, let's get dinner."" Don't get me wrong. The film and its story are monumental.literally. But great movies are a different thing. This just was not a great movie.<br/><br/>I might have easily tolerated an another hour of this film, perhaps going into greater detail of the Nazi stealing machine or more behind the scenes action to save it---even the politics to make it happen. I was thinking more like Charlie Wilson's War (2007). I would have gladly traded two hours of the wasted time in The Wolf of Wall Street for more education on great works of world art.<br/><br/>The one great moral question this film posed was the value of human life versus the value of historic works of art. Clooney, as art warrior Frank Stokes, states unequivocally near the end that saving the artwork was worth men's lives. I am not sure I am convinced. I think his statement that the men who died would have felt their effort was noble and just to fight evil like the Nazi's was worth it, ...but their lives for canvas with paint and carved marble? TMG thinks human life is more scared and valuable. Reasonable efforts? Sure. But there will be more great artists and more great works made. Saving the past is hugely important, but not at the cost of my Dad's life (who survived WWII) or that of my son or daughter. This was a point well made in this film by the Army leaders who had already seen way too many young men and women die. They were not going to risk more lives to save pictures. I think their viewpoint may have been too dismissed in the film.<br/><br/>Go see this film. Support what it stands for. Take your children. Educate them on the meaning of guts, bravery, principals, evil, culture and goodness. Just don't expect a great movie. But thanks George. TMG does appreciate the effort."
"zardoz-13","Null","5","11","8 February 2014"," Fatigue Duty
","I love World War II movies, even stinkers like Quentin Tarantino's ""Inglorious Basterds."" For the record, I prefer Enzo G. Castellari's made-in-Italy, World War II mission movie ""The Inglorious Bastards"" (1978) that Tarantino took and altered drastically with his remake. Nevertheless, I haven't seen a good World War II epic since Steven Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"" (1998) with Tony Hanks. Everything after ""Saving Private Ryan"" pales in comparison to classics such as ""A Bridge Too Far ,"" ""Battle of the Bulge,"" ""Beach Red,"" ""Castle Keep,"" ""Catch 22,"" ""Sands of Iwo Jima,"" ""The Bridge at Remagen,"" ""The Devil's Brigade,"" ""The Dirty Dozen,"" ""The Great Escape,"" ""The Guns of Navarone,"" ""The Longest Day,"" and ""The Train."" These seminal films appear with regularity during patriotic holidays on both AMC and Turner Classics. Initially, I thought writer & director George Clooney's ""The Monuments Men"" might tower above all the second-rate shrapnel that Hollywood has been shelling out like ""Normandy,"" ""Company of Heroes,"" ""Battle Force,"" ""Fortress,"" ""Red Tails,"" ""Saints and Soldiers: Airborne Creed,"" and ""Pathfinders."" Unfortunately, this fascinating chapter in World War II history about Allied soldiers who toiled to save the treasured paintings and sculptures of Western Civilization that Adolf Hitler looted during his 12-year reign as Der Führer amounts to a monumental bore. Meantime, Clooney has assembled a superlative cast including ""Private Ryan"" himself Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Jean Dujardin, Bob Balaban, Hugh Bonneville, and Cate Blanchett. The production values look first-rate. Clooney's production designers and art directors shot the works with their $70-million budget to create sprawling scenes of bombed out towns and authentic aircraft laden military landing fields. Furthermore, to accentuate the realism, Clooney lensed these maneuvers on location in England and Germany, too.<br/><br/>""The Monuments Men"" covers a little known chapter in American military history that occurred after the Allies broke through Hitler's defenses on the French coast in 1944. Clooney and co-scripter Grant Heslov, who co-produced and appears briefly as a doctor in a scene, adapted the history tome ""The Monuments Men: Allied Heroes, Nazi Thieves and the Greatest Treasure Hunt in History"" by Robert M. Edsel and Bret Witter. This World War II movie focuses on an outfit of old-ball scholars, architects, and museum curators who sought to recover the art works that Hitler pilfered and planned to place in a Nazi museum in his home town in Austria. An earlier text ""The Rape of Europa: The Fate of Europe's Treasures in the Third Reich and the Second World War"" by Lynn H. Nichols documented this event. Indeed, back in 2008, Public Broadcasting produced a documentary based on the Nichols book. The documentary is more exciting than anything that Clooney recreates in this static spectacle. Burt Lancaster played a brave French railroad official in ""The Train"" (1964) who thwarted the Nazis from stealing art.<br/><br/>""The Monuments Men"" resembles a 1960s era World War II blockbuster with its abundance of vintage uniforms and equipment. World War II fans will appreciate the authentic Sherman tank that rumbles through two scenes. No, you won't find any M-48 Patton tanks masquerading as either Sherman or Tiger tanks. Unfortunately, little violence occurs in this loquacious, leisurely 119 minute opus. Two of our heroes die from enemy bullets with a minimum of bloodshed. Two of them capture a Nazi youth sniper during a brief exchange of rifle fire. ""The Bridge at Remagen"" contained a similar scene. A firefight breaks out in a peaceful pasture between Nazis and American G.I.s after one of our heroes spots a stallion and stops to admire it. A Nazi officer fires his pistol at an off-screen Allied officer and mortally wounds him. Neither are shown in the same shot dramatically slinging lead at each other. George Clooney attacks a brick wall in a tunnel with a pick-ax. Possibly the most egregious act that occurs is several actors smoke cigarettes. The smoking is virtually pervasive. Remember, Uncle Sam stashed cigarettes in K-rations. Sometimes, a rare profane word is uttered. Otherwise, ""The Monuments Men"" amounts to a lukewarm World War II movie that loiters on the periphery of the action. At one point, two of our heroes are at the Battle of the Bulge but not in the battle itself. Clooney never cuts loose with a machine gun at the Nazis. Indeed, our starry cast spends more time talking about what they are going to do than riddling the enemy with lead. Occasionally, Clooney shows the evil Nazis gloating over stolen art work. Our heroes do undergo basic training. At one point, John Goodman stops crawling through an obstacle course and stands up while a G.I. is firing a machine gun. Later, Goodman is appalled when he learns the soldier was blasting away with bullets instead of blanks! ""The Monuments Men"" shuns conspicuous blood and gore as much as it does dramatic conflict.<br/><br/>""The Monuments Men"" suffers from several shortcomings. First, characterization is one-dimensional. We are given little insight into any of these characters. Each has a nominal scene that introduces them, but Clooney is more interested in what they are doing than who they are. Cate Blanchett has the most provocative role. She served as a secretary to the Nazis and maintained an inventory of their systemic looting of treasures from Paris. Initially, she is imprisoned for collaborating with the Nazis, when she hated them. After the authorities spring her, she approaches our guys with suspicions until Matt Damon flashes his reassuring smile. Second, the storytelling is episodic. Various men go off on various adventures. Third, the adventures lack pugnacity. Nothing memorable either happens or is uttered. Fourth, Clooney abhors dramatizing anything. A land mind scene in a cave could have yielded a little sweat and anxiety, but Clooney plays it strictly for low-key laughs. Fifth, the orchestral theme music fails to bolster the action and often sounds like it is undercutting it. Watching ""The Monuments Men"" is the equivalent of fatigue duty."

","Well, I suppose the sets were nice. I didn't go in expecting an action flick, but the characters had no depth, the story plods along and delivers NO really interesting moments. All the talent in this movie obviously couldn't save it from an extraordinarily dry script. The History Channel documentary the other night was far more interesting than this film. Half way through the film I decided to get a snack and when I asked my wife what I missed, she confirmed, nothing. I suppose this film will have a measure of interest from really fanatical WW2 buffs, but for the average movie goer, who likes historical films, nope. There just had to be a better way to tell this story than this film. Perhaps this would have been a watchable HBO film, but in the Cineplex? Not worth the gas to drive to the theater."

","This is an interesting little film, telling the story of a team of artists, art historians, and so on, sent to try to rescue works of art pillaged by the Nazis in the European part of World War 2.<br/><br/>As is often the case with Hollywood films, the role played by non- Americans is downplayed. A token Brit and Frenchman are included, but when the time comes to kill someone off, guess which two bite the dust.<br/><br/>That said, the film is well cast and the main actors (all men apart from Cate Blanchett) work well together. A nice casting touch is putting George Clooney's father, Nick, as an older version of the same character as George Clooney himself plays, but in a codicil set in the 1970s, long after the main business of the film is over.<br/><br/>The script has its moments and the music is excellent. The whole thing ends on a pleasing note of triumph. Yes, much that was fine and good was indeed lost. But so much that might have been lost was not, thanks to the effort made by people like the ones we see here. In the film, President Truman is shown asking whether it was worth it – a very pertinent question. The Clooney character gives an equally pertinent answer – yes, it was.<br/><br/>So, to sum up, this is an unexpectedly charming and absorbing piece of entertainment – maybe a bit light for its subject matter, but a mostly enjoyable couple of hours.<br/><br/>Rating: 7/10"
"bryank-04844","3","2","3","22 August 2015"," Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this.
","George Clooney has had an amazing track record of films he has been in and directed. From 'Good Night and Good Luck' to 'From Dusk Till Dawn', the brilliant man seems to know what he is doing. Clooney is also no stranger to war movies, as he has been involved in several different war films, but he has yet to direct one up until now with 'Monuments Men'. Sure, you can argue that 'Monuments Men' isn't a ""war film"", but rather more of an art heist movie, but I would argue against that.<br/><br/>I would categorize this film in the 'war' genre as it takes place during WWII, has battle scenes, soldiers, training camp, and Hitler. This story is a great story, one that you might not have heard of if it weren't for this film, but it's a mess of a movie from top to bottom, which is unfortunate, because it has an amazing cast. As the film would let you know at the beginning, ""This is a True Story', and it is. The film follows a small group of older men who head out to Europe at the tail end of WWII, in order to find and take back all of the art stolen by the Nazis for Hitler's giant art museum, which never came to be. In true fashion, the film starts out as 'Ocean's 11' started out with Frank Stokes (Clooney) trying to recruit a team to head to Europe.<br/><br/>His first recruit is 'Ocean's 11' alum Matt Damon, and the two sit at a bar, drink, laugh, and talk about the operation. It is never explained what Stokes actually does in the film, other than he is a lover of everything art. He explains this to the President of the United States, who then allows him to form a team and head overseas. We see Stokes recruit several other older gentleman who are all art scholars of some sort including John Goodman, Bob Balaban, Bill Murray, Dean Dujardin, and Hugh Bonneville. He doesn't recruit younger men, as most of them are already overseas on ""more important"" operations.<br/><br/>One of the main problems with 'Monuments Men' is its characters. There is no single trait to distinguish each character. They all seem to run together with the exception of Bill Murray's character who receives a little bit of background and emotion. Other than that, it is difficult to really feel for any of these characters, no matter what fate my serve them. So this team, as they've dubbed themselves the Monuments Men, are in Europe and are traveling place to place looking for the stolen art. And it becomes apparent that the big key art piece they are looking for is the 'Madonna and Child' sculpture by Michelangelo himself.<br/><br/>As they go from place to place, saving art, and mostly avoiding being killed by remaining Nazis, there is no real character camaraderie to help us enjoy the mission their on, other than it being a group of people making things difficult for the Nazis. If you're expecting a film with lots of gun fights, war scenes, and blood, than this is not the movie for you, as there is not any blood, nor is there one single nazi kill. It made me want to immediately watch Tarantino's 'Inglorious Basterds'. Instead, if we have one of our main guys face-to-face with a nazi with guns drawn, the scene ends happily with the two sharing a cigarette, a few laughs, and both sides going on their merry way. Clooney tries to add some very emotional moments dealing in barrels of gold teeth or some other reference to the holocaust, but it seems to on the nose, and not enough time is given to make the scene work.<br/><br/>In fact, each scene never seems to have an end point, but rather just clumsily slides into the next. The dialogue at times is very cheesy and silly too, and in no way works in this film, which tries to be half comedy and half drama. Perhaps one of the worst things about 'Monuments Men' is its score. Alexandre Desplat supplied the score here, which he has some impressive work under his belt, but here, he completely missed the mark at every turn. Instead of receiving a score that would add suspense or make us feel some sort of emotion, we got a score that sounds very similar to HBO's 'Curb Your Enthusiasm'.<br/><br/>It was all very silly and slap-sticky. It completely takes you out of the element. Especially in the last scene of the film, which is a blatant rip off from 'Saving Private Ryan'. It is laughable, and not in a good way. 'Monuments Men' has a great story and a great cast, but missed the mark on just about every level. This movie could have been much better if someone else took the reigns from the get-go. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this. Instead, wait for this to air on cable before you enjoy."

I highly recommend that everybody avoid this tedious and annoying movie. I see that George Clooney co-wrote and directed this farce. He should stick with acting in the future and leave the writing and directing to those who know how. The dialog was contrived. The flow of action was erratic. The character development was absent. The plot development was sporadic. It is a true shame that a worthy story such as this was so poorly put together by Mr. Clooney and his team.

","Based on the previews I expected The Monuments Men to be more comedic. It has an excellent cast whom are no strangers to comedy (John Goodman, Bill Murray, George Clooney, Matt Damon). Don't be under any illusions, though. This is a historic movie against the very real backdrop of World War 2.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't quite know what it wants to be. It starts off with promise and reminds one a little of ""Ocean's Eleven"" as the team of Monuments Men are assembled. There is some light banter that is entertaining. The movie quickly loses this comic momentum though as the serious business of saving art starts. It never evolves fully into a movie with a true ""war"" feel as the comedic always threatens to come to the surface although it never really does. At some point you do start to wish that the movie will just finish and run to its conclusion.<br/><br/>I suppose (upon re-reading my previous paragraph) that this ""don't know quite what to expect"" feeling of the movie very closely resounds with the real historic events surrounding the Monuments Men (or anyone going to war, for that matter.) It starts off with unknown anticipation but as the personal costs escalate one does become more grave until you set about fighting for what you believe in in a ""business-as-usual"" matter. For this reason I do believe it to be a quite good historic film.<br/><br/>The film is not hugely entertaining, although the seasoned cast does bring enough to the table to keep the user engaged. I found the historical sites and the exploration of a part of history I was unaware of quite interesting and therefore enjoyed the film. I don't expect this film to have mass appeal though..."

Film is one of North America's greatest artistic endeavours and achievements but here it resides at the ridiculous end of the spectrum. <br/><br/>The script, cinematography, soundtrack, acting, continuity and editing are thoroughly uninspired, clunky, hackneyed and badly done. No tension, no jeopardy. The tone and feel also jar - WW2 looks clean, colourful, dry, warm, washed, pressed, cosy and well fed - a weekend re- enactors nostalgic dream and not the dirty, wet, endlessly fatiguing, brutal, constantly life threatening, hungry, total war it was."
"spunkoff_g","Null","2","3","27 February 2014"," Dead Boring
","This film is the worst thing I have seen since my eyes were forced to endure John Travolta's Be Cool. To start with, there was no start. A rambling speech about the importance of Art. The film does not suppose intelligence on the part of its audience; instead it forces its point on viewers with bland seemingly poignant philosophical statements such as: 'Is art worth a human life?' If this film was art, it wouldn't be worth the life of a dormouse. <br/><br/>As other reviewers have noted, there is a distinct lack of script: couldn't Clooney have paid someone to write something more coherent? As it is, the film rambles without direction, with the audience neither knowing nor caring what happens to its protagonists. <br/><br/>Also, whilst one shouldn't be surprised by the blatant pro-American bent, what really gives them the right to believe they won the war single handedly? I don't mean to be biased, but the British fought more than the Americans and made a far bigger sacrifice. Ditto the Russians, who are portrayed as nothing but barbarous thugs unlike the altruistic Americans. So why are the British always portrayed as being loathe to fight (they don't capture Bruge)? Its like that bit in a Bridge too Far when the British tanks pull up so they can brew some tea. Nonsense. The one British character in this film gets shot by his own stupidity. If it was an American, he would have shot all six Germans in the blink of an eye. <br/><br/>The film was too broad in its reach. It should have been narrowed down further to make a better story. All we get is plodding from one scene to another, with all the characters being instantly forgettable. <br/><br/>If you want to see good war films on Art and War then watch The Train with Burt Lancaster, which makes the same point more subtly. Or even Kelly's Heroes. Don't bother with this film- buy yourself a haircut instead."

But the story is quite ordinary, a pretty straightforward of team assembly, team goes to the field, team does what their task is. It doesn't really contain a twist or something to keep audiences on their seat. For me personally, the movie is not recommendable to go see in the cinema. <br/><br/>Steady story build-up with a rather slow pace doesn't really maximize the potential of the cast of actors and actresses. And for a movie tagged as Action on IMDb, it doesn't have enough action in it. Yet the movie has a good main cast of great, yet somewhat aging LOL, actors and actresses.<br/><br/>George Clooney, Matt Damon and John Goodman is being busy with back to back filming after ""Gravity"", ""Behind The Candelabra"" and ""Inside Llewyn Davis"". Though it is kinda strange to see Bill Murray in a significant role after quite a long time, especially as a soldier. Cate Blanchett is just plain simple in this movie.<br/><br/>Well, at least one good thing of the movie is we get to see Omaha beach of Normandy's condition after the hell of D-Day landing in ""Saving Private Ryan"". The film has many spots for jokes. It has nice insertions of mild verbal jokes. It even fill in funny moments of clumsy soldiers in a firefight with a teenage sniper. And Matt Damon doing the dud landmine is just awkwardly stupid after 3 movies of Bourne Trilogy, LOL. <br/><br/>The film's musics reminiscent of classic old school 1970s-ish war movies. This can be somewhat good and familiar to the older generations, yet it is strange and a bit weird for us the generations of the millennial birth. <br/><br/>For me, it's a 5 out 10 movie score."

","I heard mixed reviews of this film though my lady and I thought ""let's go"" seeing the interesting cast assemblance. What I braced myself for was another World War II gore-ridden film with an art history perspective. Though the story did start a bit slow, it was a good run with the looted art as the primary focus. The slap stick humor shed light in the increasingly deeper and darker tone as the story unfolded and the Monuments Men delved deeper into the war zone. Some scene transitions were a bit jerky but overall a good story line with some great background shoots.<br/><br/>A much appreciated aspect is the portrayal of strength of the characters and integrity portrayed during a tumultuous time in world history. The disparity among the characters made for some interesting lines. It was made evident the value of art as a remembrance of where we have come from, a semblance of western values held deep. And the unfolding of the relationships was definitely more akin to the respectful culture of the day more than now. I found it pleasing that when James (Matt Damon) is invited to spend the evening with Claire (Cate Blanchett), James exits her flat with grace sans sex scene not necessary for the focus of this film.<br/><br/>Overall well worth seeing, including with the family."
"maurice_yacowar","Null","2","3","9 February 2014"," US army dispatches unit to rescue Nazi-stolen art
","George Clooney's The Monuments Men is this year's version of Ben Affleck's Argo. A historic event is twisted into a celebration of American nobility and effectiveness. At a time when the US seems powerless in international diplomacy and warfare these films have an obvious appeal. In the long run, however, I wonder if Americans would be better served with accurate history instead of rosy myth making. At least theoretically, in a democracy an informed population should be able to make better decisions than a deluded one.<br/><br/>The script, music and structure seem pulled out of WW II films, despite the one original element — the Un-Soldierly Seven's campaign to retrieve Western art classics stolen by the Nazis. The poster calls the yanks' adventure ""the greatest art heist in history."" Nope, that would be the Nazis' huge theft of which the Americans — with of course merely token help from France, England and Canada's contribution, Matt Damon's French — managed to recover only a large portion. <br/><br/>As Affleck did, Clooney's script mixes humour, bristling character relations, and dollops of sentimentality, as if a spoonful of sugar is needed to make a fake history lesson go down. Like Affleck's invented airport chase, here the yanks blow open a mine and retrieve and load 3,000 works of art, including a large Michelangelo marble and the Altar of Ghent in the few hours before the Russkys take over. <br/><br/>In one respect Clooney does America some service with this film. He represents the nation as committed to culture. At least his heroes here have that commitment, if the country at large — e.g., the Republican Right — does not. Perhaps these heroes' valour might convert those in the audience who have the power to arrest the nation-wide underfunding of art museums, the closings of orchestras and the abandonment of arts education.<br/><br/>The Brit's death trying to save the Michelangelo Madonna explicitly raises the question: Is even such a great work of art worth a person's life? As that character managed to overcome a career shame and die with new dignity, he might think it was. No-one else has the right to answer that.<br/><br/>But that question opens up another issue, which the film carefully frames out. Clooney valorizes the Americans for sending out a brigade to save art. The film excludes the American government's refusal to save the Jews from Nazi annihilation, denying not just refugees but even the urging to bomb out the railroad lines to Auschwitz. So the Clooney character has no claim to the moral high ground when he says: ""The Germans took better care of the paintings than they did people."" On this the American record is no better.<br/><br/>The ""Jewish issue"" is mentioned. There's the army driver Epstein, a German refugee from Newark; the shot of the warehouse of Jewish dispossessions; the Cezanne theft from the Rothchild collection; and the Clooney character's rejection of the German officer's antisemitism. But applauding America's rescue of the art without acknowledging its abandonment of the Jews undercuts this film's moral authority. <br/><br/>Of course, that would be another movie. Would a culture committed to feel-good commercialism ever make it? For more see www.yacowar.blogspot.com."

It's a bit hard to take seriously someone as grossly obese as John Goodman in fatigues. There's no way anyone could have got to that size on wartime rations let alone manage an assault course.
Clooney has said the film is about ""80% accurate."" Personally I find that a little generous given that the climax of the movie is ripped off a real life event completely unrelated to this story. It is actually a retelling of the US's mission to beat the Soviets to Werner Von Braun and his missile research and nothing to do with saving works of art.
But from the rest of the unengaging storyline I'm guessing there wasn't actually enough excitement in the true events to warrant an interesting screenplay.
In summary, it passes a couple of hours if you are bored. Band of Brothers - it ain't."

"nsedbon","Null","1","1","7 March 2015"," Monuments Men: A Five star casting hinders the plot
","*****Spoiler ALERT*****<br/><br/>The Monuments Men is a World War II fact-based story, quite different from the World War II stories we became familiar with over the years. George Clooney is both the hero and the film maker. This movie benefits from a five star casting : Matt Damon, Bill Murray, Kate Blanchett, John Goodman and our favorite ""Frenchie"" Jean Dujardin and top of it, an unusual schemer plot. Eight men, at first sight anything but soldiers, are gathered to save Art. Hitler pilfered great European painted and sculpted masterpieces-  all of them symbols of the  very best of humanity- in order to build his own private museum. They plan to claim the pieces of art back, bring them back to their owners before Nazis burn and destroy them, out of defeated spite. <br/><br/>The story starts while German retreat has begun : indeed you can see no battle field scenes. So, what does keep the viewer in suspense though?  With no doubt the lack of action, hinder the great and brand-new topic of the epic art stealing during war. <br/><br/>The main reproach that comes to my mind is that it is quite hard to distinguish the characters from the superstar casting :  you can build a vague idea of the character real identity but never really disassemble it from the superstar. Furthermore, there is  a lot of switching back and forth between the teams of soldiers but too little time is spent with any of them,  for the characters to grow and the story to cohere.<br/><br/>First of all, this movie is not like a typical war movie because people fall in The Monuments Men but in awkward ways rather, we are miles away from bloody scenes : fond of warlike movies, do not move forward, Monuments men is not for you !   Secondly, the vision of soldiers this movie gives us is also different. The soldiers are not traumatized, as  not involved in the war extreme violence. This is what Clooney points out- still with the corners of his mouth curved in a faint, derisive smile- he will come back to his routine while the Nazi general will rot in jail. Indeed, characters wonder if they can be called soldiers as they are not fighters. During the film this ambiguity is triggered by the difficulties they have to defend their cause in front of the other ""genuine soldiers"". Who cares about art while millions of persons are dying and villages destroyed ? Hence the answer of this philosophical question: if you destroy art you destroy memory that comes along with it. Nazis did not put up by destroying life but any drafts of humanity achievements they were willing to exterminate. That is what those soldiers fight for. Obviously, Americans cannot escape the traditional role of  Humanity saviors.  This thoughtlessly  tricky subject  can lead us to consider this movie as naive , but on a second thought, is this not this specific same thoughtlessness that differentiate Monuments men from what we do expect of a war movie ?  As I saw this movie I did not imagine that this dramatic ambition would sound so familiar"
"The Grand Master","3","1","1","31 January 2015"," Mission failed
","The Monuments Men had a good cast assembled which gave this movie a lot of potential. George Clooney, Matt Damon, Bill Murray, Cate Blanchett, and John Goodman. Plus George Clooney was the director and a writer along with Grant Heslov based on a novel. Although the movie meant well, unfortunately the end result was a dour disappointment with a very slow pace which left many audiences unsatisfied. The Monuments Men certainly could have been a lot better.<br/><br/>Based on a true story from the novel by Robert M. Edsel and Bret Witter, The Monuments Men tells the tale of an unlikely World War II platoon made up of museum directors, curators, and art historians recruited by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to be sent to Nazi Germany on an impossible mission behind enemy lines to rescue art masterpieces stolen by Nazi thieves and return them to their rightful owners before 1000 years worth of art is destroyed.<br/><br/>There are many reasons as to what went wrong with this movie. The movie is very disappointing, slow and non-eventful. The Monuments Men tries to emulate such classics as The Great Escape, The Dirty Dozen, or Kelly's Heroes, but falls way short of reaching that potential. This is certainly going to be a black mark against George Clooney as an actor and director. Consider this mission a failure.<br/><br/>3/10."
"tedg","Null","1","1","30 December 2014"," The Diary
","I am thankful that Clooney is working. I've heard him speak as himself; he is a good man, interested in good things. I forgive him his lack of range as an actor, because the characters he plays are so engaging. <br/><br/>And he made ""Good Night, and Good Luck."" That film was based on two ideas. First was the notion that a real event is so intrinsically powerful that any reasonably accurate portrayal will allow its fracture of time to be evident. Those were times which stressed the American ideal and good men spoke up. Now are times that stress American values ever so more and the press is silent. So on this score alone he was right in planning this film.<br/><br/>The other idea from ""Good Night"" is that there is power in words, and to make words cinematic you photograph smoke. This worked alarmingly well. An entire turbine revolves around these two ideas, focused.<br/><br/>Now here we have the first of these again. We were at war. Some nations were doing profoundly evil things. We weren't dealing with nuisances, but the loss of our very existence and surely the core of representative democracy. America remained noble, and perhaps the pinnacle of this was the way other nations, cultures were supported. Possibly at no time since Darius have conquerors been so respectful of heritage, even of the defeated. This is powerful stuff, this American history, this notion in our time.<br/><br/>The movie should have worked. All it had to do was to focus on this singular ideal.<br/><br/>But we have at least three movies muddled about in one mix. I assume this because of meddling by financiers. We have a ""Dirty Dozen"" who somehow represent the hundreds who actually were there. This has the required: famous actors giving recruitment nods at the beginning, then antics. We have the similarly required redemption of souls typical of the genre, but done without the usual wit, grit and score.<br/><br/>We have the story of two artistic objects, elevated among others because religious art can be surrounded with cinematic gravitas where more direct soul-to-soul touching could only be cinematically convoyed by a film that truly is transformative art. This component is also profoundly weak. We never care.<br/><br/>Buried in these rambles is a third movie, a whole movie apparently shot independently. This is so sublime, so powerful that I am recommending the whole thing to you. The story is simple: a Parisian curator is recruited to help Germans steal art on a grand scale. (This was Germans, not Nazis, and was general theft but here we focus only on the art.) She secretly keeps records in the hope that it may be returned, even though many owners were murdered.<br/><br/>Once she is discovered by our heroes, she doesn't believe they could be so noble. Surely, she believes, one conquering army will be be as appropriative as another. She comes around when the ideal becomes real, and helps. She is central to the successive recovery of much, before the thuggish Russians arrive.<br/><br/>A simple story. All Cate Blanchett had to do was show up and walk through it like the others. But no, she is riveting. I couldn't breath when she was on screen, so taut was the space around her. It almost seems that Clooney engineered three levels. One is the memory we carry of war films. A second is a sketch of a war movie as background to this powerful third level of the woman's story.<br/><br/>Cate's character is drawn with many unknowns. She is without a partner, steeped in tragedies that we cannot know. She is hungry but reserved, steaming but tacit. All her pains are channeled into deliberate, constraints that we see in every motion — and later in the precision of the diary. (Whoever made this prop deserves an Oscar.)<br/><br/>It seems that both Clooney and Blanchett studied what worked in Schindler's List, where it wasn't the investment in speech that anchored the story but the creation and honoring of a document. The document (her diary of the thefts) then inherits all the qualities of the irreplaceable art but distilled into something to build a cinematic situation around. This is truly an achievement.<br/><br/>Oddly, the whole enterprise is framed by Clooney's character presenting to senior politicians, first to propose the (reluctantly approved) saving of art and then to report the successes. I don't think anything like this actually happened. The dynamic was that the war effort was not a success because of armies, but because of the inventions of civilian scientists and engineered manufacturing miracles. War is always about the technology of destruction, so is at root about harnessing genius.<br/><br/>After a certain point, keeping these folks engaged meant building some healing into the enterprise. Simple as that and a far better story."

","Here's something you don't consider when watching a war movie or hear about the exploits of war heroes. What would have happened if someone, somewhere had not given a second thought to preserving ancient and rare works of art while Hitler was ransacking Europe during the Second World War? I see a lot of reviewers critical here over the picture's pacing and production, but I never got the feeling I was watching something that didn't have an inspirational story to tell. Maybe Clooney's screenplay and direction aren't the greatest but the story is one that needed to be told, and unless you've been pointed in the right direction about the importance of the message, I don't know how many viewers might have been made aware of it otherwise. Had Hitler succeeded in securing or destroying these treasures, the world would have been so much the poorer following the War. ""The Monuments Men"" offers a different perspective on war and it's aftermath; one is left thankful that the artifacts saved by a vast array of historians, museum directors and curators could be secured and preserved for generations to come."

James Granger (Matt Damon) goes to Paris and finds French art expert Claire Simone (Cate Blanchett) who is leery to help him. Donald Jeffries (Hugh Bonneville) goes to Bruges to find a Madonna sculpture.<br/><br/>It's fine to have light comedic moments in a war movie. The problem is that there isn't much of a war in this movie. I understand this is based on a real group of people but this movie needs a bit more Indiana Jones to spice it up. Also it hurts the movie to keep splitting the group up. Matt Damon's bad french is funny. Bill Murray and Bob Balaban seems to have fun ribbing each other.

Many events in the movie such as Matt Damon's character stepping on a mine, John Goodman and Jean DuJardin having a gun battle with a Hitler youth, Bill Murray and Bob Balaban's confrontation with a German soldier, and the 'romantic' interlude between Matt Damon and Cate Blanchett's characters are complete fiction. I agree with many of the other reviewers that the overall atmosphere of the movie was not in keeping with the serious nature of the subject matter.

","When I saw the preview for The Monuments Men, I was really excited. I've never been all that crazy about George Clooney, but I love Matt Damon, and the film is based on a little known tale from a famous historic event. Stories like this one, are often turned into some of the best films that Hollywood has to offer, and I was sure this film would be a can't miss. Clooney stars and directs this extremely large and diverse cast, which ultimately turns into it's downfall. When you have a large cast of talent, you need to be very careful about how you use them. In The Monuments Men, the cast is split up all across Europe, leading to short scenes, that jump from location to location far too quickly. When the crew is reunited towards the end, the film becomes much better, and in my opinion, this is how the story should have been told right from the beginning. The story centers around a community of art lovers, who are distraught about the Nazi's theft of historic works of art. As the war is winding down and the Nazis defeat is imminent, these men want to make sure that the worlds greatest works of art are protected, and their willing to risk their lives to do so. As I stated earlier, George Clooney stars and gives his usual performance. When Clooney first started doing movies, he was exciting and really gave audiences their moneys worth, but lately all he does is play the same character over and over again. Clooney is the mysterious, handsome stranger, who does a lot without saying much. Some people love that kind of thing, as for me, I find it to be lazy. If you just wanted to direct, there was more than enough talent to carry this film, and in fact, I would have preferred to see Bill Murray or John Goodman in larger roles. The story told in The Monuments Men is extremely interesting, but it's told in these fast paced, short scenes, that do nothing but confuse the audiences and squander the extreme amount of talent this film has to offer. Needless to say, while I thought the film was a great idea, I was far from impressed."

","I don't know why this movie was so badly reviewed. I suppose there were those who saw the movie with the expectation of seeing something akin to the Tomb Raider, with bullets and gores flying all over the place?? The movie played out more like a documentary with splashes of drama here and there. I personally enjoyed it. I am one of those people who would prefer visiting art museums over a balmy beach. Therefore, it was a complete enjoyment to see all the masterpieces in the movie, and see how brave and valiant the characters were. The story began with a group of men who were the 'geeks' of the art world, and no one expected to die at all, because they were tasked to retrieve artifacts, not at the front line. But then the movie showed these men actually experienced what a soldier experienced: death, danger, fear, homesickness etc. I sympathized with the characters when they were down, and I felt their exhilaration/awe when they found the art pieces. I didn't know the monuments men existed until this movie, and to have a glimpse of what they did to save the pieces, and what were lost in the process, made this movie both an enjoyable drama and educational movie for me."

Art is society's most prized cultural possession, a lineage of our history through hundreds and thousands of years. Its preservation over such a time is an achievement unto itself. The cast of actors elevates the potential of The Monuments Men to boundless heights yet it falls abysmally flat.<br/><br/>I was incredibly excited for this movie when the trailer was released – but then the film faded away almost immediately after its debut. I now know why: while not bad, The Monuments Men is certainly not good. Everything about this movie is wrong, from the casting, tone, directing, screenplay and music.<br/><br/>There is no plot structure within the dialogue laid out in the screenplay. Seven main characters and no structure is a recipe for disaster and The Monuments Men is confusing and fragmented. The film tries to anchor its plot to locating and securing Michalangelo's Madonna and child and Van Eyck's Ghent altarpiece. Unfortunately that is not enough when the lead characters break off into teams of two after thirty minutes and the plot scatters accordingly.<br/><br/>Clooney's direction shows a lack of vision and inability to maintain a consistent tone throughout the film. At first it The Monuments Men a pseudo-MASH/Ocean's Eleven ragtag comedy. Fifteen minutes into the film and the tone flops to a somber historical drama. With the music concurrently changing from cheesy patriotic brass propaganda to overly melancholic instrumentals.<br/><br/>The cast is sublime on their own, but with this poor script and direction only exacerbates the confusion and lack of clarity. If this film had committed completely to being a comedic interpretation of the novel then The Monuments Men may have succeeded.

","'The Monuments Men.' Maybe I should have found out more about this film before I watched it. I thought I had a round idea... we're told from the promotional material that a group of 'misfits' hunts important pieces of art during the end of the Second World War and prevents them from falling into Nazi hands.<br/><br/>And, to be fair, that is what it's about. However, I don't know what I was expecting, but it never seemed to fit into any particular genre. It's not really a war film. Yes, it's set in the middle of a war and – almost – every scene depicts a war-torn Europe. However, there's hardly a shot fired throughout the entire film. The 'misfits' label makes it sound like some sort of 'Dirty Dozen' film where a bunch of screwballs triumph over adversity (falling down quite a few times along the way). Again, the characters are a bunch of misfits, yet they're certainly not funny enough to be particularly entertaining. Yes, I know this is a serious subject (i.e. Nazis stealing – and sometimes destroying – precious art during the war), so I wasn't expecting the central characters to behave like clowns, but I thought their interactions may be a little more enjoyable.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, none of the characters are really fleshed-out enough for us to care that much about them. Despite the cast being full of excellent talent, all seem to be a little underused. The story is simply the main characters sitting in one war-ravaged location after the next, discussing where they're going to look next for a painting, or sculpture.<br/><br/>There was some attempt to interject a 'baddie' element. Early on in the film we meet a Nazi who's also hunting all the priceless pieces of artwork. However, that story is kind of snubbed out halfway through and feels a little disappointing.<br/><br/>What we're left with is an important story (as it is based on true events) that find themselves told in the blandest way possible. The cast do their best, but the script just isn't that enjoyable. Maybe the film-makers were trying to accurately capture the 'depressing' feel of the era. If that was their intention then they succeeded. I felt gloomy waiting for it to end, too.<br/><br/>http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/"

","Well, the summary pretty much says it all; I would much rather have watched a documentary on the same events, as this movie adaptation falls WAY short of being either sufficiently serious to lure out any empathy or sufficiently funny for it to provide comic relief in what was no doubt meant to portrait the brutal and cynical actions and events during the end of WWII. No attempts were successful - and I can say this without having any idea of the purpose of the movie, because it holds absolutely nothing of value, except a cast who's attendance will have cost something in the vicinity of the art presented in the film. A fine wast of time for a cast of fine actors, who should no doubt have spent their time better on other projects. A documentary would have told the story better and with less confusion as to how the director wanted to present the events. Hollywood textbook mess-up."

","College drop-out George Clooney manages to direct another pretentious waste of time. This movie is not sure if it is supposed to be a mockumentary, a bumbling comedy or a serious drama. As a comedy it is not funny, yet the musical score gives the ambiance of a campy WWII TV-show so it is hard to take it seriously either. That leaves the film as a some form of a bad mockumentary but I don't believe Clooney intended this, yet this is what he achieved.<br/><br/>The acting comes off as lame caricatures, with the dialogue falling flat. Who wants to watch a bunch of idiots bumble their way around Europe, while some get killed because of their stupidity? The casting is also horrible as neither Clooney, Damon or Goodman can act. Bill Murray is decent but he cannot save this mess.<br/><br/>The most insulting part is how pretentious Clooney makes the Monuments Men out to be. They are geniuses saving ""art"" while all those dumb hicks and war-mongers want to blow it to pieces for fun. It is not that saving art is not important, it is that life is more important but Clooney literally gives pretentious speeches implying otherwise. No one cares Clooney, really no one cares.<br/><br/>Then Clooney manages to inject 21st century anti-smoking propaganda into the film by mocking the cigarette smoking of the time. Over and over and over again, smoking cigarettes is used as a bad comedy device that only intelligent progressives will understand. I have never seen such insane behavior in a period piece over smoking before.<br/><br/>After the second idiotic death in the movie, I just turned it off and I recommend you don't even turn it on."
"ProfessorFate","4","1","1","28 June 2014"," Bad story-telling and a tad vain
","Here's the problem with ""Monuments Men"": Bad script. A group of art experts are introduced but we really don't know anything about them. Then we are expected to care about them and empathize with their cause. The script doesn't flesh out their personalities enough. <br/><br/>For example, there's a scene where Bill Murray's character gets a recording from his daughter in which she sings ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas"". Bob Balaban's character surprises him by playing it over the camp PA system. It should be a touching moment, but it isn't because we don't know anything about his daughter or their relationship. Instead it just seems forced.<br/><br/>Then there's a bit of US propaganda in the film. The US soldiers have to save the artworks not only from the Nazis but also from the Russians. According to the script, only the Americans seem fit to handle the art treasures of the world. Was it just a coincidence that the token British and French soldiers died while all the Americans made it out alive? I'm American and this even bothered me.<br/><br/>Sure, we're all in favor of protecting art from senseless destruction, but the film has a rather superior attitude about it. ""Look at how noble we are - defying death to save paintings and statues."" I'm not so sure the answer to the question ""Were the lives lost worth it?"" is as obvious as the film would have us believe.<br/><br/>So yeah, the film is a bit awkward in it's plotting and character development, and a bit misguided concerning the life-or-death value of art. A definite misstep for Clooney and company."

","Review: This movie has a great concept and some top class actors, but it does seem to drag in parts. I know that George Clooney, the writer and director, wanted to stay to the story so he couldn't make a comedy or a full out action movie, but for entertainment it seemed to lack a sense of wit. I did find the storyline interesting and all of the actors put in great performances, I was expecting a bit more from from Clooney. I don't think that it will go down as a all time classic, but it's a watchable movie that portrays an important time in history. Watchable!<br/><br/>Round-Up: I could tell that Bill Murray was holding back in this film, which is a shame because it could have done was some of his humour. Matt Damon and George Clooney always have great chemistry on screen, and John Goodman hasn't always been able to hold his own, regardless of the project, which is why I was expecting something amazing in this movie. On the plus side, you can't help but fell emotional when they find some of the art pieces and Clooney did make the film look and feel believable to that period. I'm sure that there was loads of material left out of the storyline, so I would like to see this movie made again with an in depth look into what really happened with the Monuments Men.<br/><br/>Budget: $70million Worldwide Gross: $155million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into the World War II movies about a group of men trying to retrieve artwork from the Nazis. 5/10"
"tomgillespie2002","4","1","1","8 June 2014"," One of the biggest disappointments of recent years
","It's rather difficult to spot a George Clooney-directed movie. He's riffed on the Coen Brothers, Billy Wilder and Alan J. Pakula, without ever settling on a style of his own. Of course, there's nothing wrong with taking inspiration from masters of their craft, but there's something undeniably empty about Clooney's output (the excellent Good Night, and Good Luck (2005) excluded). His latest, a light-hearted, men- on-a-mission World War II romp, is quite possibly his worst yet. It wants to be a war movie of old - a breezy, patriotic adventure best enjoyed on a rainy Sunday afternoon, but ends up being awkward, saddled with an awful script penned by Clooney himself and frequent collaborator Grant Heslov.<br/><br/>After successfully convincing the U.S. President to assist in maintaining the cultural heritages of the countries ravaged the war, Frank Stokes (Clooney) is given the go-ahead to round up a crack team and enter Europe to save the art looted by the Nazis. Stokes and his friend James Granger (Matt Damon) quickly gather the team - which consists of Richard Campbell (Bill Murray), Donald Jeffries (Hugh Bonneville), Walter Garfield (John Goodman), Jean Claude Clermont (Jean Dujardin) and Preston Savitz (Bob Balaban). Granger heads to occupied France and hooks up with spy Claire Simon (Cate Blanchett), who believes the team are out to steal the art for themselves, while the rest of the group split up with various objectives.<br/><br/>Artistic licence has obviously been taken here, and there is no problem with that for the sake of both entertainment, and bringing the valiant efforts of those involved in the real Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives Program, to people's attention. The undeniable greed of the Nazis (they hoped to open the Fuhrer Museum to home their loot) and the merciless destruction of any work produced by Jews, shouldn't be hard to convey to an audience. Yet, somehow Clooney struggles to make us care. Perhaps it's the cheery casualness of it all, or the fact that the film is nothing more than a few scenes lacking context where the cast mess around without letting us in on the joke.<br/><br/>This is Clooney as Steven Soderbergh, clearly channelling his experiences on Ocean's Eleven (2001), but lacking the ability to control an ensemble or pen a script that helps establish each character. On paper, the cast is of the highest quality, but in the film, they are all basically the same person. Everyone is 'the funny guy', yet no-one is funny. Without any feeling of a consistent threat throughout the film, it's hard to care, so Clooney lumps in an 'I think I've stepped on a mine' scene near the climax which cries of desperation. If this had been made 50 years ago with, say, Henry Fonda, this would probably be a classic. But this is 2014, and The Monuments Men is one of the biggest disappointments of recent years.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"
"matic-boh1","4","1","1","6 June 2014"," Simply disappointing
","Although the foundation for it is a fascinating story of a group of men that aimed to rescue famous artwork from the Nazis during the Second World War, The Monuments Men fails to place its remarkable narrative in the forefront, and is rather dominated by poor writing, poor direction and overall lack of momentum. The film seems to be approached entirely in the wrong way, as its tone is often far too casual and humorous, despite it recounting a war story of great significance and interest. The audience is constantly exposed to awkward shifts between comedic and emotionally intense scenes, and due to the unflattering execution, the film is ultimately not particularly amusing nor dramatic. Perhaps its greatest appeal is an impressively star-studded cast, but as it often happens in such cases no one is able to truly shine, which results in a film that offers no outstanding performances. Overall, The Monuments Men is a film with incredibly noble intentions that lacks quality in execution, and despite its intriguing story undoubtedly deserving better, the outcome is ultimately very disappointing."

","""The Monuments Men"" has a very solid cast. You see George Clooney, Matt Damon, Cate Blanchett, John Goodman and Bill Murray and you're expecting something special. And the story seemed as if it should lend itself to something special. It's based on the true story of an Allied team put together during World War II whose mission is to locate and recover art treasures stolen by the Nazis. It was a significant mission - to save the cultural heritage of Europe. Between the cast and the story you expect something better. By the time it's over, you find yourself thinking that you were expecting something better. In the end, ""The Monuments Men"" disappoints.<br/><br/>Clooney was Stokes, who convinced President Roosevelt to form the team, and Damon is Granger, who in many ways the movie revolves around. Both were fine. But, in the end, the movie just wasn't very interesting. It sputtered along. At times there were attempts at humour, and there were even sombre moments with reflections on the Holocaust scattered throughout. The most powerful scene for me revolved not around the discovery of stolen art, but rather of a barrel full of gold fillings. There's also a portrayal of early American-Soviet rivalry. Both want to find the art, but both have different plans for it. The Americans want to return it to its rightful owners, while the Soviets plan to keep it.<br/><br/>There was enough material to work with to have made a pretty good and exciting movie. But somehow, ""The Monuments Men"" missed the mark, and turned out to be disappointing more than anything. (5/10)"

","It is a bummer when 20th Century Fox rescheduled Clooney's fifth director endeavor THE MONUMENTS MEN into a lukewarm February release, bodes ill for its craftsmanship which may not up to Oscar's caliber. But gaging from its stellar cast, a more probable upshot could be a fun-loving teamwork like OCEAN 11-13 fanfare, yet, it does't even achieve this lesser goal. <br/><br/>The film is hit or miss in coagulate its plain script with an aimlessly disorganized narrative, even during its climax it feels lagging and insipid. Obviously the execution is at a loss to define the picture's overall temperament, a war drama, or a lightweight comedy, or an ensemble piece of entertainment, it seems that Clooney wants to blend them altogether, but it boomerangs badly, it eventuates to be an ungainly nondescript, only if art cognoscenti can generate some faint buzz over the looted art treasures and groan what a trespass conducted by the execrable Nazis. <br/><br/>In the mid-1940s, a USA task force constituted by art experts and led by Clooney enters behind the enemy line to aim to retrieve millions of pillaged art pieces from the retreating German troops as many as possible, some of which are historic and significant. Yet, the story unfolds heedlessly, and even it is near the end of WWII, casualties are still indispensable, lives can be dispatched all in a sudden, but overall one tends not to care too much since the brains behind the film don't allow anyone to invest a deluge of emotional turbulence in it as a consequence of its wooden presentation of the historical matter and whimsically evasive editing choices. <br/><br/>Nothing too much can be commented on the cast although Blanchett can be perpetually singled out in any films she is in, among the Monuments Men, Murray and Balaban are borderline enjoyable, Goodman, Dujardin and Bonneville are half-heartedly dutiful, Damon and Clooney are just playing house in the war zone. <br/><br/>It is an 118-minute paean to the importance of preserving art, we get it, just a reminder, stopping bombarding is a nice precaution to this purpose, take that, all the radical militarists!"

","Problems right off the bat: 1. Certain types of movies, especially docudramas, should not be cast with well known, famous names. Their personalities detract from what were common, everyday down-to- earth people. The actors seemed more like caricatures of themselves. 2. If there was a war going on you would never know it. Seemed more like a tour of famous art collections in Hollywood. 3. The dialogue not only seemed misplaced but had that Hollywood writer speak to it; overeducated, over articulated Beverly Hills cleanliness. 4. Speaking of cleanliness did you seen any dents, scratches on the vehicles let along dust? Even the uniforms had that freshly manicured look. Why is that important? Attention to detail is one indicator of authenticity. 5. Most importantly I couldn't get any emotional attachment to anything including that most important goal of saving works of art. They could have been saving truckloads of McDonald's burgers and I wouldn't have known any differently."

","Well this isn't a bad movie, but it is a disappointing movie of 2014. It just didn't have that impact or emotion to make it leave a mark. It tries to have those uplifting moments with the music and all, but because of the poor development and chemistry it just isn't able to reach that level. Sure this is based on a true story and the men that fought for culture and art did a commendable task. I thought they were trying to go for the ""Ocean's Eleven"" with it's cheesy concept and all but it wasn't that which was kind of a relief. But there just isn't enough momentum to actually really care about the task and the characters at hand. Despite the fact that they are men trying to protects precious art works from Hitler's hands. This sort of reminded me of the movie ""The Untouchables"", it has more substance than ""The Untouchables"" but just lacked the flare as well. Just everything from the dialogues, to the characters to the direction is just bland. It's not awful, it is a watchable flick but nothing all that amazing. It was a nice idea to try to make a movie revolving around this story that is known by few people. Since movies about trying to take down Hitler has been done countless times in movies and video games. Sure, each characters does have time to shine a couple of times and George Clooney does make a good leader. I probably shouldn't be saying this, but it sort of reminded me of ""The Expendables"". Because it has all these characters that just doesn't have enough to develop and have a solid chemistry to care. Except ""The Expendables"" is directed towards gratuitous violence and action, but that isn't the case for ""The Monuments Men"". Even the death scenes for few members on The Monuments Men team is sad, but for the wrong reasons. Not because of how it went down, but because there just wasn't anything for the audiences to feel emotional over. It's unfortunate, but this is sort of a waste of a actually very good premise.<br/><br/>6/10"

A lot of ""oh, how horrible the Germans are"" and ""how civilized and caring are the Americans"", with a bunch of other nations that were so sketchy that no one really cared about them. There were a few scenes that surprised me, like the one with the German soldier who just smokes with some of the Americans, then leaves. In a such cartoonishly one sided film, I was amazed to see that even Germans were human, a courtesy that was not extended to the Russians, for example.<br/><br/>Bottom line: a film devoid of empathy, filled with propaganda complete with heroic soundtrack.

"burlesonjesse5","6","1","1","7 May 2014"," Clooney's latest has a great look but feels unfinished and a little misguided.
","If you combined elements from cinematic fare like MASH (1970), Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), and Ocean's Eleven (2001), you'd get The Monuments Men. And despite these elements, this film as a whole, still manages to border on the edge of tedium. Shot capably and lushly by integrity-minded George Clooney, ""Men"" was supposed to have been released for Oscar season in December of 2013. So much for that. Its now February and here we have something that has such a calm, somber, almost mute feel to it. There are some nice images and some effective, individual moments. But in the big picture, it feels unfinished not to mention half-baked. It seems like scenes were left out. As a result, for almost two hours, a sense of intrigue or suspense is sorely lacking. Also, I couldn't decide whether The Monuments Men was a comedy, a drama, or in fact even a war film (almost no combat at all).<br/><br/>Clooney, looking like your typical matinée idol and resembling Clark Gable from Gone With the Wind, does double duty as star and director here. He spins a web about a true story depicting seven important people. It's WWII and Clooney's Lt. Frank Stokes decides to recruit these seven men consisting of museum curators, architects, and art historians. They are obviously too old to fight in a war yet they go through basic training, wear uniforms, carry firearms, and basically pose as soldiers trying to retrieve stolen art. This is art that could be lost in battle or even taken by the Nazis. Stokes gets the OK for this action by way of a letter from President Franklin D. Roosevelt. And from that moment on, the recapturing of sculptures, paintings, etc.., is seen as way more important than the gauge of human life. Speaking of human life, in ""Men"" there is very little character buildup and it's hard to feel anything for anyone involved. In fact, a couple of members from the Monuments group actually die. No one even makes a fuss about it as evident from the choppy editing by Stephen Mirrione (he edited 2000's Traffic).<br/><br/>The cast or for a better word contributors, consist of an assortment of great actors. Matt Damon plays Lt. James Granger, Bill Murray plays Sgt. Richard Campbell, and John Goodman plays Sgt. Walter Garfield to name three. Clooney, riffing off his character Danny Ocean from Ocean's Eleven mentioned earlier, uses everyone sparingly as a director. He gives them almost no room to breathe. By the time the closing credits come up, their images are plastered on screen (along with their names). This seemed kind of laughable as I sat in the theater because it felt like these guys were barely in the film to begin with. I mean Bill Murray was completely held back. Featured in ""Men"" as the chief architect, he doesn't have anything or anyone to bounce off of. I've seen Murray underplay roles before but this was really hard to watch. It's not his fault but along with the rest of the cast, he seemed to be slumming it. Heck, the whole film seemed to be slumming it.<br/><br/>Overall, The Monuments Men is a vehicle in which not much happens. And it's really not a whole lot of movie to begin with. Now I no doubt think of George Clooney as a fine director. With ""Men"" though, he doesn't make an awful film, just a ""monumentally"" misguided one."

"toqtaqiya2","6","1","1","19 March 2014"," A war movie with an ensemble cast that suffers from poor pacing, direction and characterization.
","From CFR member George Clooney comes the cartoonish The Monuments Men, a blatant piece of Anglo-American propaganda. It's a good thing that I got to see this film for free. Director Clooney and screenwriter Grant Heslov took a real World War II story and turned it into an average film with few redeeming factors. There are abundant war movie clichés and propaganda clichés here, like the American obsession with the value of every soldier's life, the constant mention of Jews and what they allegedly went through, and stereotypical portrayals of protagonists and antagonists alike. The film may be based on a true story but it's been changed so much that it has almost nothing in common with that story. Even the names of the main characters have been changed. Some of Hollywood's biggest names participated in the film but they're mostly just playing themselves. George Clooney, for example, isn't really playing George L. Stout. He's playing George Clooney. The propaganda is constant, so you're always reminded that all Americans and their British buddies are freedom-lovers. The filmmakers also wanted to squeeze in as much comedy as possible. The American characters come off as a group of bunglers who tell jokes every chance they get. The German characters too are played for laughs as often as possible, and there's hardly any menace to them. Strangely, the only characters that are portrayed with any seriousness are the Russians, and these allies of the Americans are the only ones who seem menacing here. My question is why were the Russians even included in this film? Was it just so they could see that flag left behind by the ""freedom-loving"" Americans? Talk about strange. The only information the film offers about the Russians is that 20 million Russians were killed during the war. Yes, but it would have been more worthwhile to mention that the Germans looted or destroyed plenty of Russian art too. For example, the historic city of St. Petersburg was heavily bombed by the Germans. Most palaces, houses and monuments weren't left standing there. So a lot of what can be seen in the city now was rebuilt after the war. It's obvious that The Monuments Men was made for propaganda purposes. It was a rushed job too. The filmmakers didn't take the story seriously. Therefore, the film is a big failure. The performances by the ensemble cast are muted. John Goodman, playing Walker Hancock, and Bill Murray, playing Robert K. Posey, are the ones who suffer most in this respect. They could have been replaced by unknown actors and it wouldn't have made a difference. The only part of the story that seems developed is the relationship between James Rorimer (Matt Damon) and Rose Valland (Cate Blanchett). Everything else seems half-baked, especially the humorous conflict between Posey and Lincoln Kirstein (Bob Balaban). There were times when Clooney demonstrated that he can be a very good director. However, The Monuments Men is flawed both as a history lesson and as a men-on-a-mission movie. I don't recommend it.<br/><br/>The filmmakers claim that the film is based on the book The Monuments Men: Allied Heroes, Nazi Thieves And The Greatest Treasure Hunt In History by Robert M. Edsel. That may be true, but I think that they got the idea for making it from a Voice Of Russia interview. Check the link below.<br/><br/>http://voiceofrussia.com/us/radio_broadcast/72430379/75734031/"

Obviously, looking for the cast who present to us some Oscar winners like George Clooney , Matt Damon, Cate Blanchett and Jean Dujardin, everybody expects a great movie and that's a normal wish.<br/><br/>The movie begins in a slow pace, developing the characters and the idea that the art masterpieces are a very important piece of every civilization, that brings a lot of culture and a part of her own history, and that maybe worth sacrifice yourself to keep this works under protection (A question that George Clooney - the director and protagonist, presents in some parts of the film).<br/><br/>Summarizing, that's a honest movie, who hasn't a deep history, and didn't present any spectacular interpretation of any of the actors, but teaches a part of the human history (that I didn't know before watch this movie) in a good and unpretentious way.<br/><br/>If you looking for a art movie with great actors, watch the movie The Monuments Men, but don't forget to go with low expectations and don't expect that will be a wonderful film, that may change your life.<br/><br/>A honest 6/10 to me."

With the exception of Matt Damon you wonder if the elderly group of Monuments Men would realistically survive on the Western Front in 1944. Why did Cate Blanchett and Hugh Bonneville want to be in this movie? Cate gives a good performance as a French art gallery curator. Hugh is more uncomfortable in his role as the token British contribution to the mission. He is quite a contrast to his more familiar role as the Earl of Grantham in Downton Abbey. <br/><br/>The story is good but the production should have been better. There are a series of vignettes but not tied together well. The subject has not been treated with enough depth."
"randycoates","Null","1","1","23 February 2014"," A Bit Disappointing
","I thought this movie was a bit of a disappointment. I am a fan of the films George Clooney has worked on in the past (even though I am not exactly a huge George Clooney the actor fan, but not anti-Clooney either, I could take him or leave him). I do like a lot of the actors in this. As far as I am concerned I don't think Bill Murray could make a wrong move in any movie because he always comes across great just doing his thing, and he does the usual good job here.<br/><br/>The movie is about a group of guys who kind of get thrown together when they form a unit to save valuable art from the Nazis. They don't want it to get destroyed or stolen so risk their lives to get it all back before the end of the war comes."
"steven-leibson","8","1","1","23 February 2014"," It's a popcorn movie. Don't expect too much except a pleasant afternoon
","There are a lot of negative reviews about this movie because it doesn't achieve all that it might. A tremendous topic, the Nazi theft of as much European art as the Reich could carry, the destruction of much of the rest, and the discovery and recovery of that art by a small group of men dedicated to the task. This is all based on true events. If you want to see a documentary about the Reich's heist, watch the excellent ""The Rape of Europa"" and you'll get all you want. If you want to spend a pleasant afternoon watching the dramatized George Clooney version, better called ""Ocean's 11 Saves Private Art,"" then see this movie.<br/><br/>There's a powerhouse team of actors including Clooney, Matt Damon, John Goodman, Bill Murray, Hugh Balaban, Cate Blanchett, and Hugh Beaumont that's not even slightly stretched in this movie. Yes, the script could have done far more with these talented actors. It doesn't, so there's a lost opportunity. Too bad. Instead, what we have is a cheesy white-hat/black-hat, ""The Good War,"" World War II movie where the good guys win and the bad guys lose. You know, the kind of movie we used to watch before all those ambiguous wars messed with our moral compasses and made us less than certain of just who we are.<br/><br/>For me, the movie was worth it just to watch the 5-minute scene where George Clooney's erudite character explains to a captured and smug German officer why he's not anti-semitic. The German officer was reported to have run ""one of those camps."" The officer told Clooney that he had run one of those camps, and that Clooney should be thankful to the German for helping to clean up ""the problem."" Clooney pulls out a cigarette even though he doesn't smoke, lights it up, and replies that the cigarette will help him to remember this conversation after the war while he's enjoying a New York Times review and a bagel at his favorite Jewish deli in New York City. He will remember the cigarette and the conversation but the German officer will be utterly forgettable. In this, Clooney portrays the morally progressive and unambiguous American we wish we were.<br/><br/>Perhaps movie audiences are no longer able to sit through clear, morally unambiguous fare like ""The Monuments Men."" I, however, felt it was an afternoon well spent."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","1","1","22 February 2014"," The Magnificent Seven rides (figuratively) again.in a languid way
","The main event truly starts about 20 minutes into the movie, after the establishing scenes that include a sequence not unlike the recruiting of the ""Magnificent Seven"". The time is July 1944 and the stage is Normandy, one month after D-day, Operation Overlord. Whether it's Sword, Juno, Omaha, Gold or Utah doesn't really matter, as you see our protagonists going ashore from a landing craft. While the venue reminds you of scenes you have seen from ""The longest day"", ""Saving Private Ryan"" or and half dozen other movies, the mood is entirely different. Although it is just one month after the gut-spilling (literally, graphically, if you still remember Mr. Spielberg's haunting rendition) struggle for a toe-hold on the beachhead, we now see our protagonist sauntering along the almost deserted beach as if they were on a Sunday outing in the park.<br/><br/>The mission of the artists and men of various other talents is to rescue a staggering number (from hindsight) of artwork that the Nazis, and Hitler in particular, tried to steal (or rob, whatever you call it) for their own collection. The process, however, is not what the trailers might have you believe. This is not ""Dirty Dozen"" by any stretch of imagination. As intimated in my summary line, our heroes go about their noble task, sometimes singly, sometimes collectively, sometimes in pair, in a manner that can almost be styled as ""languid"". All over Europe, they ask questions, they follow leads, and yes, they engage in some combats which are often casually narrated. It can almost pass for an archaeological team going on various digs.<br/><br/>Those who have more than they bargained for in the action department from Hollywood will like the often pensive mood of this movie. There are also lighter moments although in that score the script does not rise above the standard one-liners and customary stabs. The cast assembled impresses but could be put to even better use. Still, the likes of George Clooney, Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman and Cate Blanchett rarely disappoint even if they are not at their most brilliant moments."

I was expecting bland and it delivered just that.<br/><br/>The cast also had me worried. Whilst some of the names were great in their own genre. Putting them together in a wartime drama also had me worried that the chemistry just wouldn't be right. It wasn't. Bill Murray seemed handicapped and Matt Damon equally so.

Whilst very loosely based on fact the film has, like so many older WWII movies, been tailored to appeal to a more local demographic. For example, the number involved and roles they played; the origin of the group in 1942 in Libya by the British etc. This is deeply sad, because you are left viewing the whole movie as a work of fiction, which undermines those who did such important work to save great works of art, transcending the war itself. <br/><br/>This film had an important point to make regarding the loss of great art through conflict but could have been so much better.<br/><br/>See http://www.historyextra.com/feature/historian-movies- monuments-men-reviewed"

","Don't waste your time or money on this movie. Despite a stellar cast, ""The Monuments Men"" is a piece of cinematic dreck, unworthy of its cast and director. Mr. Clooney's directing and acting skills went AWOL in this poor excuse for a motion picture. It is a textbook study of how to make a fascinating story dull and boring. The directing, editing, bland acting, and dreadful script suck all interest out of the movie. The only way you know there is any tension or danger is the sound track -- otherwise the actors and director fail to wring any emotion out of the high school quality script. Scenes just suddenly end. SPOILER: There is simply no tension when Matt Damon is trapped on a land mine. And when the Russian army is descending on our heroes, you could cut the tension with a limp noodle because there just wasn't any.<br/><br/>I wish I could be more positive about this movie, given the pedigree of its cast and director. But sadly there's no escaping the undeniable mediocrity of what could, in the right hands, have been a film nearly as exciting as ""The Great Escape."" I know that is is not easy to make a good film -- and ""The Monuments Men"" is the poster child for a simply bad, unentertaining motion picture."

The pace is steady but slow in the parts mentioned. I wished the ending had a longer story to end the story.

"guchrisc","Null","3","6","18 February 2014"," ""Art for art's sake"" in this mild war film about a crack unit of artists.
","Around this St Valentine's Day is the usual slew of romance-based films, but also rather surprisingly, a bunch of war-films too. This film caught my interest, seeming to deliver a nice balance in entertainment, without making the subject-matter too heavy, and so it turned out.<br/><br/>Film is by 20th Century Fox and Columbia. It stars George Clooney, who also directed and produced it, as well as wrote the screenplay. Thus this is very much George Clooney's baby. Last year he merely played second fiddle to Sandra Bullock in the critically acclaimed 'Gravity'. If that film showcased Miss Bullock, then this one does the same, in spades, for Mr Clooney. Like 'The Descendants' of two years previously, once again we have a film that captures a mix of emotions.<br/><br/>This is a war film so it tends to follow a well trod format. Like, for example, 'The Dirty Dozen' (1967), it starts with a military objective being set out. Then the unit is recruited and trained, before finally going into action. However apart from this being set in WWII, just as was 'TDD', in most other aspects this film is very different.<br/><br/>Firstly, it is important to state, as the film itself does, that this film is based on a true story. George Clooney plays the part of an artistic type, who knowing the threat to the art world posed by the war, is tasked to assemble a group of educated and like-minded individuals, to go and protect and rescue art-works threatened with destruction or theft.<br/><br/>Film opens with the art-saving scenario and quickly moves on to the recruitment and basic-training of the unit. Before much time has elapsed the unit has been sent across the Channel to France where war is raging. Like 'TDD', this film too, has an all-star cast. Matt Damon rightly deserves his second billing with his very entertaining character. He is required to speak French, and I could not get enough of this. His French is subtitled, so that we can enjoy the full richness of his dialogue. So do mind the French.<br/><br/>The French joie de vivre, is displayed perfectly by Cate Blanchett. The scenes between Miss Blanchett and Mr Damon, seem to capture perfectly the essence of the time. Mr Clooney seems to capture this well too in a Christmas scene. This one, like others in the film, captures the good and the bad. In war there is laughter as well as tears, joy and sadness. The fact of the very fragility of life, in war, is shown in the mix of emotions. Everything is intensified, from comradeship to mafioso horse.<br/><br/>In style then, this film, if anything, is shot in the same style as 'The Great Escape' (1963). That film too was based on a true story. Like this one, it was populated with interesting characters, had funny scenes, and sad scenes. So yes, like 'TGE', 'TMM' is a sort of boys own adventure story, a romp, and a ripping good yarn. However it is still a war story, and several scenes have been inserted that reflect the worst of times that were WWII. So, be prepared to be entertained, but be prepared also for a lump in the throat, and the tears to well up too.<br/><br/>Before WWII, Winston Churchill warned of the rise of the Nazis, and when the war had started, he was rightly the man needed to step into the breach. He viewed the struggle as one between Civilisation and a new Dark Age. As the Huns, Goths, and Vandals, destroyed The Roman Empire, so too the art-destroying, book-burning, Hunnish Nazis, even as they retreated, as they faced defeat, seemed determined to plunge Europe into a new Dark Age. This film shines a light on a story, that helped prevent the darkness descending, and helped us to emerge, (one scene in particular very explicitly shows this in a metaphorical way), emerge from the darkness, and into the light.<br/><br/>For many years, 'The Great Escape', was traditional Christmas fayre (at least for the British anyway). Now Mr Clooney has made a modern film that can compete with that one. Like that one, this film is populated by ordinary people, trying to do extraordinary things. The film captures well the breadth of the war; unlike some Hollywood productions that show only the Americans winning the war, this film seems to make an effort to show accurately the Allied effort. So we encounter Limeys as well as Yanks on the Western Front. The French Resistance is also mentioned. The Eastern Front is not entirely neglected, so watch out for the Russkies too, they were players too, in this story too! <br/><br/>As said, this film, in tone, is very much like 'The Great Escape'. So enjoy it, and cheer along, as our heroes battle against the evil Nazis. Film is a romp suitable for nearly all of the family except those whose more delicate dispositions are easily upset.<br/><br/>Based on a true story, this is an entertaining, good, and uplifting, film. A war story with some comedic moments, and some sad ones too. 10/10.<br/><br/>C'mon the artists!"

","Although this film was brimming with its own self admiration, and advertising itself like there was no tomorrow, i had this sinking feeling that it was going to be...well...monumentally disappointing. And with the likes of Bill Murray, John Goodman, Matt Damon and Cate Blanchett, I should have no reason whatsoever to feel pessimistic about its release, but it wasn't their names that filled me with dread. It was George Clooney; Mr Auto-Pilot himself. When i seen the trailer i was immediately expecting a Casino to appear. The whole recruiting thing i had seen before, the same soul-less (oh look at me i'm cool) character. So lethargic, nothing new. And i have no qualms with him stepping behind the camera, he has a substantial amount of experience, why not? But when he decides to insert himself directly as the Leader of The Monuments Men, well then a film with potential has just took a severe blow to the gut...with a sledgehammer. <br/><br/>The film felt empty the entire time, the acting, the scenarios that so desperately tried to suck sympathy from you or lure a cheap laugh from you. Yes the story is fascinating, and it should be launched into the limelight and given a film that makes you appreciate what people risked for, now, historical pieces of art or sculptures. It is an incredible canvas to create a masterpiece of a film, but George Clooney doesn't do incredible, he is placid in his acting and uninspiring as a director. Each film he has directed he has starred in. Why isn't (at this point in his career) being behind the camera enough? Why does he have to inject his lackluster persona into the film and leave it docile? Now I am not completely down on Clooney, i enjoyed the Oceans Trilogy, Descendants, Up in the Air and most of all From Dusk Till Dawn, but despite that he just can't help but play the same person and the film has to hold your attention in order for you to disregard his routine performance and enjoy the film as a whole. Unfortunately for this film, he is all over it, i would be hard pressed to recall 5 minutes in the film where Clooney isn't there.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast try to shine, but every time they do....here's Clooney.... and he eclipses them. Try to show emotion, but...wait...there's Clooney again. If he where a musician he would be a one man band. Wants to do it all himself. Cate Blanchett played her part really well and bounced off Matt Damon. Murray and Bob Balaban try their best with the material given, but it quite frankly isn't funny and even if there was something that garnered some chuckles (like Damon's ""French"") then they do it again, and again and again. One thing that bothered me was that the entire film has a small sub-plot that seemed completely unjustified. Unworthy of the eventual climax. I'll leave it at that.<br/><br/>This could have been a great film, but the sea of potential evaporated and was replaced with an Ocean of Clooney."
"lucasnochez","7","3","6","13 February 2014"," Review: The Monuments Men/ www.nightfilmreviews.com
","Through his career as an actor, George Clooney has offered audiences with a well-to-do list of fine performances that bring to life vivid influential fictional and exciting non-fictional characters. There is no doubting that currently Clooney is a highly regarded, respected and powerful force within Hollywood. And thankfully his work as an actor has yet to be complete. It is in my humble opinion that Clooney, as a director, has excelled in the medium quicker than as an actor of his time. As a director, Clooney has elevated the mainstream storytelling technique as well as contributes to having a tremendous, natural execution of developing his characters, especially when it comes to telling the true stories of some of the most influential behind-the- scenes men that were born and raised in the United States. Clooney's intent in his films is to preserve culture, history, and a way of life, bringing to life as well as sharing the many amazing stories of men (and women) who make him proud to call himself an American.<br/><br/>From Chuck Barris, creator of the Gong Show and supposed CIA agent (played perfectly by Sam Rockwell) in Confessions of a Dangerous Mind; to Edward R. Murrow, the man responsible for the censure of Joseph McCarthy and McCarthyism (played gallantly by David Straitairn) in Good Night, and Good Luck; to Dodge Connelly, a mimic of Herald 'Red' Grange, an icon of American football (played by Clooney himself) in Leatherheads; to Senator Mike Morris (Clooney) in the political-thriller The Ides of March based loosely on the 2004 Democratic primary campaign of Howard Dean, Clooney has quite the knack for bringing to life the controversial stories of some great American men and their great patriotic accomplishments and failures.<br/><br/>With The Monuments Men, Clooney finds hints of the potential essence that surrounded his greater directorial body of work, but unfortunately, falls into a formulaic routine that solidifies the film as a quasi-informative, melodramatic and somewhat predictable clichéd piece of American cheese. Bound to make its way into library halls and fall under the categories of 'forgettable' and 'unaffecting', The Monuments Men becomes an outdated artifact of recycled ideas that would see itself in the historical section of the museum collecting dust and being completely forgotten in the years to come. <br/><br/>With scenes as predictable and numbered as the Dewey Decimal System, The Monuments Men is still a hard film not to like. Lead by a profound group of talented actors, the film tells the true life story of a small group of men who searched high and far through the immense rubble and destruction of the Second World War for the very fabric of humanity, culture and history. Lead by Frank Stokes (Clooney) and his hand-picked team of artists; James Granger (Matt Damon), Richard Campbell (Bill Murray), Walter Garfield (John Goodman), Jean Claude Clermont (Jean Dujardin), Donald Jefferies (Hugh Bonneville), Preston Savitz (Bob Balaban) and the young Sam Epstein (Dimitri Leonidas), the main objective for the men is to safely find, preserve and return famous and amateur art; art that Hitler was stealing with the intention of opening up his own museum.<br/><br/>One of the biggest reoccurring elements throughout the film is the value of human life and the value of art. Clooney, throughout his narration, continuously makes clear that no artwork, no matter how valuable, is worth a human life. Yet, this statement seems somewhat impossible and disapproved during one of the most notorious wars in the history of world, responsible for countless casualties. Although stark and heart-warmingly affective, the narration by our protagonist serves as some of the films most thought-provoking segments of the film, yet takes away from the actions depicted on screen. The narration instead serves as an almost 'in case you missed it' captioning to the often times laughable and overly-comedic action on screen.<br/><br/>Like with any Clooney directed feature, he is always able to round out a talented and multi- faceted cast that sometimes drive the stale action and narration itself. Comedians Bill Murray, John Goodman, Bob Balaban, as well as recent Oscar winner Dujardin, deliver an abundance of unneeded comedic relief that often takes away from the heavy subject matter and serious drama the film is attempting to sculpt. Finding the humour and humanity of a war that didn't seem to have much during its occurrence, The Monuments Men is a light-hearted take on a solemn historical piece of time.<br/><br/>Having the only female lead in the film, Cate Blanchett proves here more than anywhere, even amidst all the comedy and juvenile goofiness, that she is next in line to be our generation's Meryl Streep. Camouflaging herself in her French accent and wholly Parisian character, Blanchett is one of the film's saving graces. The other, as always, is the charm and bravado of the always impressive Matt Damon. Although mocked throughout the film for his horrendous French accent (now that was funny), Damon allows the imperfections of his depiction of a very real American solider to navigate through the progression of the story's conflict with ease. His scenes end up becoming the crucial developments for his company of men, whereas most of the other characters rely heavily on luck and good fortune.<br/><br/>Check out the full review at www.nightfilmreviews.com"

But George Clooney has director with everything else pretty much falls short. Although George Clooney and Cate Blanchett are pretty good. But Matt Damon performance does not do much here. And Bill Murray half the film looks like he's recovering from a hangover, John Goodman is alright, but that's it. There is no real exciting building up to anything. For the most part it feels less a film and more like a friendly get together.

"mkelly54","Null","3","6","10 February 2014"," Not your average war movie
","This is one of the most rare war movies I've seen. I read Robert M. Edsel's book with the same title, so I was anxious to see the story on the screen. To be perfectly honest, I wasn't disappointed. <br/><br/>Just think, in the hell of WWII the President of the United States assigns a group of artists, art restorers, architects and a sculptor to save as much of the art stolen by Hitler throughout Europe. No small task, to be sure. <br/><br/>What George Clooney (writer, director, producer, actor) produced is a series of vignettes with team members seeking the stolen pieces and working to recover them, much like ""The Longest Day"" and ""A Bridge Too Far"" adaptations of Cornelius Ryan's non-fiction works with the same titles were produced as vignettes of various characters. <br/><br/>While the film does not focus on firefights, tactics and strategy, it does focus on the detailed search for Western Europe's most prized possessions, it's art. The story also provides insights into the friendships, humor and struggles encountered throughout The Monuments Men's pursuit of stolen art. <br/><br/>The acting is good to great, and the script, though scattered with vignettes, is solid. Some viewers may not connect with the stoic nature of the personalities. I can attest to its authenticity as my father served in the war and always maintained a quiet demeanor while describing his experiences  even when there was humor to his tales, it was delivered in an understated manner. And many of his veteran friends had similar persona.<br/><br/>The story also provides a glimpse at the approaching Cold War with the Soviet Union, with a team from Russians seeking the same artistic treasures, with Clooney and Company scoring one for the good guys near the end of the movie. <br/><br/>Again, this isn't your average war movie. It's better; with a true story on one of the most under appreciated and unknown aspects of the European Theatre."

Against all odds, educated, learned men and women from the Allied powers race to risk everything for the sake of saving all that the Nazis wish to savage. Against a backdrop of horrible violence, grasping greed, and unbridled evil, this film breathtakingly relates the saga of these heroes in all their magnificent glory.

"virek213","10","3","7","19 February 2014"," The Half-""Dirty Dozen"" Of The Art World
","Among the many horrific things about Adolf Hitler and his nightmarish visions of a Third Reich, which began with destroying everything Jewish (including the Jewish people themselves, of course), was the fact that the German army, under his orders, was stealing every piece of art from every museum in Europe, intending to display them all in his so-called ""Fuhrer Museum"" in his hometown of Linz, Austria or, in case of his country falling to the Allies or him being found dead, to burn and destroy all of that art, thus eliminating one thousand years of human history and creativity from the books. Into this fray stepped a half-dozen Americans with backgrounds in art. They are the subject of what is one of the best World War II-era films of recent vintage, THE MONUMENTS MEN, based on the book of the same name by Robert M. Edsel and Bret Witter.<br/><br/>George Clooney, who co-wrote and co-produced the film as well as directed it, is the man leading the charge to save as much of this priceless art as is humanly possible before Hitler and his goons send it to the flames. Matt Damon, John Goodman, Bob Balaban, Bill Murray, Hugh Bonneville and Jean Dujardin are the art experts that go along with him on this mission, a mission that began within a month of the D-Day landings that commenced the liberation of Europe. In short order, they manage to recover many great works of art stolen from the great art museums in Amsterdam and Paris, with some of the information coming from the contact that Damon makes with a French art curator and resistance member (Cate Blanchett). But they soon learn that huge quantities of art are being stored in various mine shafts in the interior of Germany, making their task even more pressing, and especially given that Hitler's defeat is nigh. In getting into the heart of Germany, going along with convoys of U.S. and Allied forces, the team must engage in firefights with German soldiers they had hoped to avoid. Finally, they get to the mine complex where the biggest and most important works of art in human history have been stored and hidden by the Nazi regime. And they don't have very long to get it.<br/><br/>Clooney and his co-writer/co-producer Grant Heslov would be forgiven if they had designed this as a combination of World War II ""impossible mission"" films like STALAG 17, THE GREAT ESCAPE, and THE DIRTY DOZEN with various ""heist"" movies; but since this is a true story that few people in the world had ever heard about prior to the publication of the book the film is based on, it adds realism to the piece. Instead of being tough-nosed hard cases like we've seen in many classic World War II movies, the men involved, even Clooney, are closer to the ""Everyman"" archetype that most audiences can readily identify with the best. The film is not without its moments of humor, of course, given that solid seriocomic actors like Goodman and Murray are involved; but Clooney doesn't avoid some of the slightly grimmer aspects of the story either, such as the discover of a whole satchel full of gold fillings, knocked out of the teeth of Jews in the concentration camps. Some of the laconic dialogue among the guys is reminiscent of what we got in THE GREAT ESCAPE; and even the score by Alexandre Desplait has a main title theme that has the jauntiness of Elmer Bernstein's score for that classic 1963 film.<br/><br/>All the cast performs admirably in the film, especially Clooney, given the fact that he is doing double duty being both in front of and behind the camera. Although the horrors of war are largely de-emphasized, the scenes of the bombed-out and burned-out French and German towns do have the feel of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. Clooney and Heslov also give the Germans a more nuanced but no less frightening portrait of venality and greed in the manner of what we saw in SCHINDLER'S LIST or CROSS OF IRON; they are not all the stereotypical goose-stepping goons. And while it is never easy to talk about too much of what went on during World War II as being ""good"" in the standard sense, THE MONUMENTS MEN is a film that proved that it's possible. Given that its subject is about saving the greatest works of art of the entire human race from the madness of one man's dreams of global empire and destruction, that is indeed saying a lot about us as a race that can only be described as ""good."""

","""Monuments Men"" (1hr 50min - Rated PG-13) has somehow, inexplicably and inaccurately, been tagged as part comedy, a charge that carries with it a wink-wink ""acknowledgement"" that it is somehow the A-Team with big stars. And with that comes the subliminal warning that the story is broad, the action overdone and the performances corny. Well, the part about big stars is accurate: George Clooney (who also directs), Matt Damon, Cate Blanchett, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Hugh Bonnevile _ and others (including Nick Clooney, George's father, in a neat cameo). Forget the rest. Comedic? No, never. Witty, yes, at times very. Based on the true story of ""the greatest treasure hunt in history,"" the film is an action-drama focusing on an unlikely World War II platoon ordered by President Franklin Roosevelt to go into Germany to recover artistic masterpieces stolen by the Nazis and return them to their rightful owners. The most striking thing about the film is its tautness, both in how it's acted and edited. There is palpable tension because the fate of the characters is always in doubt, and the awfulness of warfare is handled deftly without hitting the audience over the head. Above all, director Clooney does a wonderful thing: he gives the audience credit for being intelligent. It's a good bet that at an early-rehearsal table read of the film's script, he urged the cast to play their roles in an understated, realistic way. And they do, across the board. Clooney the director handles Clooney the actor beautifully. In the film's linchpin scene, Clooney confronts a Nazi officer and with very few words, says what he needs to _ what we would all like to _ in very stark terms, using everyday metaphors to bring home what World War II, the Nazis and the need to protect civilization really meant to this, the greatest generation. This is a terrific film."

","1944. With the tide of WW2 turning against Germany, the Allies set up a team to find and retrieve hordes of priceless art, stolen by the Germans during their occupation of Europe. Due to the fear that the Germans will destroy the artworks, the team need to be as close to the frontlines as possible, putting them in great danger.<br/><br/>An interesting and novel concept, as the search and recovery of the artwork the Nazis stole actually happened, and was a tremendous feat, yet the story is hardly known nor told. So the movie had the potential to show the search in a gritty and edifying manner. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, in going from concept to script, The Monuments Men goes from good to mediocre and just gets worse when filmed. Written by George Clooney and Grant Hersov and directed by Clooney, the finished product is sloppily written and amateurishly directed. Cheesy, sanctimonious and not historically or militarily correct, the movie starts badly and never recovers. <br/><br/>Instead of being an edifying drama, Clooney tries to throw in humour, lowering the tone, and then the humour is very weak and unoriginal. Even the comedy skills of Bill Murray and John Goodman aren't a match for a poor script.<br/><br/>It feels like an Oceans movie: assemble heaps of friends and other big-name stars, give them back-slapping dialogue and make it feel like one huge in-joke."

","I'm sure Mr Clooney had some good intentions for making this work but did he really have to set his hand to writing and directing? These tasks he has done rather poorly and drags much of his good intentions down to the level of a typical Dirty Dozen meets Oceans 11 type - this story needed more respect. It's also getting to be overly obvious that George 'casts' his cigarettes as closely as his co stars - everything he does features smoking as a major influence to the story (looks ominously like payola unfortunately?) His big cast are also pretty much your Hollywood HBO TV variety and their characters are underdeveloped to the point of creating little empathy. Pity, as the initial-based-on-fact story is worth a far stronger treatment. A good documentary could have covered this more convincingly. I'd recommend taking another look at Frankenheimer's ""The Train"" to get a better understanding of the significance of this whole Nazi 'Art theft' business. George was fortunate to get his big budget back but, I suspect many might have been somewhat disappointed with the end product considering such a costly input."

","The script continually tells you how to feel without really developing the story or characters. Be happy, be sad, be scared, etc. <br/><br/>For example, to create a ""chill"", let someone discover a barrow filled with gold fillings. Announce the finding, and then move on to the next joke or next forced moment.<br/><br/>Need a moment of comradery? Let's have one of the team step on a landmine, but not step off. Next, have each of the team members enter the room and make a one liner. (I'm sure the guy standing on the mine appreciated the chuckles.) They all work to put some weight down and then guess what, then they refuse to leave the room when the it is time for the guy to step off the mine. I can see putting your life on the line to save your buddy, but here's a first--have a bunch of guys hold his hand just so that he doesn't have to get blown up by himself, should it happen. <br/><br/>The liberal side of Clooney is sure leaking out. Need an anti-war moment? How about a good guy meeting a bad guy--a US soldier runs into a German/Nazi. In most movies, the American figures out how to kill or take prisoner the Nazi. Not here. They start a ""dance"" through the American's gestures and offerings (a cigarette) to relax and just agree that each should walk away. Even after the Nazi soldier leaves, the US soldiers don't go after him. Great, now the Nazi can get back to killing children and other things Nazi's are good at. Okay, maybe the soldier wasn't a Nazi, so he went back to killing other Allied soldiers.<br/><br/>I agree with another reviewer who said that this is an example of how not to make a movie. It was painful to watch--like a happy version of the Hollocaust that never really makes any point with any impact, though it seems to be telling you that it is all really important, in between the jokes."

"Dr_Coulardeau","7","2","4","11 April 2014"," This should have been a masterpiece
","The film is of course important for the wide popular public who does not know at all anything about that systematic looting of works of arts of any type by the Nazis. The public does not know millions of works of arts are concerned and this operation launched by Roosevelt in 1943 enabled millions of them to be recuperated, maybe not millions but a great, great number. Note Roosevelt knew about art and culture, but it is sure Truman did not know the word, let alone the ""thing.""<br/><br/>The film is important to show that this operation could only succeed if it was American, English and French at once since it was supposed to follow the front starting in Normandy just after D day and prevent the Nazis from doing what Hitler had ordered: destroy everything you can. Leave behind you a devastated and burnt out land. And actually we have a mistake in the film when it pretends the objective of Hitler was to destroy European culture. <br/><br/>In fact the objective was to take possession of all they could and put it up in a Führer Museum in Hitler's birth place in Austria. Hitler wanted to alienate the Europeans of their culture and force them to come humble and trembling to this museum to see what once was theirs. That was in fact even more cruel than just destroying it since it was not turning Europeans into deculturalized slaves but into zoo animals coming to see what they used to be. And when they were reduced to zoo animals then it was a lot easier to shoot them point blank but with live ammunition.<br/><br/>But there is also another shortcoming that is in fact ideological. The decision to destroy all those works of art was a final war measure from Hitler, but it became in the film a way not to speak of something else. The fact that millions of works of arts were plainly stolen in a way or another by plain ordinary people, like the neighbors who looted the apartment of a Jewish family that had just been arrested. Ot this Jewish family that survived in France from beginning to end by going from one hiding place to the next and paying their passage with some silverware. And we must not forget the duly paid for SNCF trains to transport everything imaginable from human deported people to treasures or ammunitions and troops. <br/><br/>And it also neglects the fact that a great number of works of art were saved by simple people who recuperated them in due time and hid them away like the tapestries of La Chaise Dieu to bring them back out once the war was finished, or even a long time later like the bronze sculptures of the Quinconces in Bordeaux that only reappeared in the 1980s. <br/><br/>The saving of the Bruges Madonna by Michel Ange and of the Ghent altarpiece just before the arrival of the Russians, is kind of cold war in spirit ahead of history, especially since this salvation was in fact possible because the local German miners had blown up the three entrances of the mine to prevent the Nazis from doing what they intended to do. Here gain the message is fuzzy. Millions of Europeans risked their life to save someone or something that was considered as valuable because the Nazis wanted them. The popular dimension is mostly ignored and reduced to anecdotal little facts, even with Claire who actually did a tremendous work to list the immensity of the spoils. Only this last case is given some prominence, but it was not possible without a very serious organization behind and under this surface.<br/><br/>In other words this film could have been a master piece but it only speaks of masterpieces without being one. Sorry for it. Clooney could have done a lot more and better with a little bit of research.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"

","The Monuments Men was a fantastic story of men who were trying to save human civilizations history in the wake of a war. The introduction, while yes it did go on, allowed us to understand the characters, allowing us, as viewers to make a emotional connection with these characters, making it more heartbreaking when one of them died. I found that I was drawn more and more to the stories of the pieces of art they were trying to save. A tear actually rolled down my cheek when they found Michelangelo's Madonna with Child statue in the mine. The movie gave me an understanding of these men and the want to know more.<br/><br/>I thought that, while perhaps it may have not been as action packed as expected that, perhaps it hit the mark in actually telling a tale of war that has not yet been touched. They were innocent men, kept out of the war for multiple reason, but dedicated to finding, restoring and return the world's stolen art and ultimately the history of earth's culture and past. <br/><br/>I also thought that the casting was brilliant. We knew the faces, it was an all star cast, and they portrayed the characters perfectly. I did not however completely LOVE the story line between James and Claire, I feel the cuts to their story were rather annoying.

"rannynm","9","2","4","28 March 2014"," Sometimes Our Achievements Are Worth Dying For
","This is a dramatic film, with some humorous moments, that shows the importance of human achievement and I loved every minute of it. The story is based on true events that center on the ending of World War II, when Nazi troops hid artwork from around Europe for Chancellor Hitler. President Roosevelt lets Lt. Frank Stokes (George Clooney) gather an unlikely squad of museum directors, curators and art historians to enter Europe and save, not only art, but people's history.<br/><br/>What makes this film strong is its story and how it shows the characters' passion for their goal. I'm not an art critic, but I recognized some of the artists and their work. But I'm not into art like these people were. However, when you see the soldiers torching the art, my heart broke and my stomach tied in knots. Watching this film reminds me that art isn't just paintings or sculptures, it's about people's accomplishments and, if that's gone, what do we have?<br/><br/>The screenplay is beautifully written by Grant Heslov and George Clooney, who also directs this movie. This film can be humorous, but it also shows the reality of war. For example, they talk about concentration camps and that's a risky move. It refers to the inhumanity that happened, but they balance well so it's not ""Shindlers List."" This dream cast includes Bill Murray (Sgt. Richard Campbell), John Goodman (Sgt. Walter Garfield), and more memorable actors that play fantastic people. Just watching them interact is entertaining enough.<br/><br/>My favorite character is Pvt. Preston Salvitz (Bob Balaban). I pick this character because when I see Bob play Preston he becomes a little ball of fire and I love this person's passion for art.<br/><br/>My favorite scene involves Sgt. Campbell (Murray) receiving a recording from his daughter while he's fighting in the war. Preston plays the recording on the announcement intercom and your heart turns to mush as Bill sits by himself smiling with tears in his eyes while listening to his daughter's voice.<br/><br/>The moral of the story is, ""Sometimes our achievements are worth dying for."" ""The Monuments Men"" love art and that's why they are picked for this team. They are willing to die to protect it. <br/><br/>I give this 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for 12 to 18-year-olds. There's some action, blood and language that younger kids shouldn't experience, however the film shows our human side and how we live to create achievements. <br/><br/>Reviewed by Keefer B., KIDS FIRST!

"classicalsteve","8","2","4","1 March 2014"," More Than Just Ocean's 11 During World War II: An Important Episode in the War Against the Nazis
","The first scene of the film is set in a church in Ghent, Belgium. Clerics are busily taking down a large paneled altarpiece which appears to be late medieval/early renaissance in its style. It's the Ghent Altarpiece, one of the most famous artworks ever forged in Europe. The panels are hastily taken down and put into a truck. Word is the Nazis are on their way to confiscate the work, possibly ordered by Adolph Hitler himself.<br/><br/>We often think of Nazi-Germany in terms of what they did in battle and/or to certain religious and ethnic groups in Hitler's ""Final Solution"". However, the Nazis didn't limit themselves only to the gunfire on the battlefields and the horrors of the concentration camps. Another aspect of Nazi-Germany's rape of Europe was the destruction of cultural heritage and legacy, particularly by plundering Europe's artwork from public museums and private collections. In nearly every country the Nazis overrun, they plundered museums and large private collections. It wasn't enough that they subjugated large populations to their totalitarian regime; they also stole their identities. The Monuments Men were a real-life group of ""soldiers"" assigned the daunting task of retrieving the art confiscated by the Nazis towards the end of the war. This film is about their story.<br/><br/>George Clooney plays Frank Stokes who outlines the importance of retrieving the lost art: ""You can wipe out an entire generation, you can burn their homes to the ground and somehow they'll still find their way back. But if you destroy their history, you destroy their achievements and it's as if they never existed. That's what Hitler wants and that's exactly what we are fighting for."" An evil power can subjugate France, but if it destroys the Louvre or Versailles, France itself becomes nearly destroyed. Save the Louvre and Versailles, France lives on.<br/><br/>After the Ghent Altarpiece scene and Stokes' speech, ""the Monuments Men"" rings a bit like ""Ocean's 11"", with Clooney soliciting art historians, scholars, and restorers from different parts of the United States. He puts together a small band of misfits who are either too old or too ill-equipped to be involved in the war on the front-lines. This is their way of being involved in the conflict in a significant way. Their mission: to find and retrieve the lost artwork either from public museums or private collections. The cast is a Who's Who of famous name talent in addition to Clooney: Matt Damon, Hugh Booneville, John Goodman, Bill Murray, and Bob Balaban, just to name a few.<br/><br/>The band breaks off into smaller groups and each has their own story. One of the most interesting is that of real-life figure Rose Valland, although they changed her name to Claire Simone in the story. She has been spying on the Nazis while they've been abducting many great artworks in Paris. In real life, she became a heroine in the cause of stopping the Nazis from their plundering. In the film, she meets James Granger (Matt Damon), who needs her help in finding the art. At first she is reticent, believing he only wants to bring the art back to US museums. In another group, there's Richard Campbell and Preston Savitz (Murray and Balaban) who are following leads into the European countryside, hoping to find some of the lost treasures. Other members go by themselves seeking to save art not yet pilfered by the Nazis, such as Donald Jeffries who goes to the church housing a Madonna and Child by Michelangelo. Eventually the groups will converge and they hit the jack-pot in a way that would make auction houses Southeby's and Christie's salivate.<br/><br/>Although much of the story is a bit exaggerated and doesn't always ring of true history, this is still a very enjoyable film about a subject which has had much less screen-time devoted to it than other subjects of World War II, at least in the United States. (Europe has been all too aware of the devastation of its art at the hands of the Nazis.) Aspects of ""the Monuments Men"" recall the rather idealized films of the late 1950's and early 1960's, such as ""the Great Escape"" and ""the Longest Day"". (The music soundtrack seems inspired by such films with one passage using a whistle and piccolo to intone its patriotic melody, similar to the Great Escape). Not quite a great film, but a good one."

What annoyed me most is that this had the potential to be a great movie but started looking bad within the first five minutes and frankly never ever recovered. Apart from treating the audience like ignorant idiots, there was no attempt at creating any empathy with any of the characters - I frankly could not care less what happened to any of them.There was no real work on any of the characters as if this was done in a great hurry. The soundtrack used was incredibly inappropriate too: was this supposed to be a not very funny comedy ? It reminded me of a Cary Grant movie with bad acting, non-existent storyline and a vision of war that is so remote from reality that it beggared belief. I found the 3-second 'sombre' shots on the likes of white crosses being assembled and vats of gold teeth particularly bad: box-ticking at its worst. I saw this in a small theatre and virtually all fellow moviegoers were just horrified at how inane and superficial this movie was.

","I certainly didn't ask to become the champion of lame ducks but having been exposed to such diabolical reviews of the 2013 ""Romeo and Juliet"" and now an even worse batch on ""The Monuments Men"" I suppose I shall have to accept the role. For the second time in under a year I find myself completely out of step. It is almost as if I have watched entirely different films from the multitude of pen blasters. Not that I would place these two works on the same level. Carlo Carlei's Shakespearian adaptation is for my money one of the finest cinematic takes on the Bard, a work imbued with passion, excitement and visual beauty that had me reeling to an extent I have not found anyone to share. Clooney's ""The Monuments Men"" is no more than a worthy middle-of-the-road film, what in terms of literature one might deem ""a good read."" As I tend only to submit reviews of films of outstanding quality, as a means of imparting enthusiasm for those I particularly admire, I would not have been writing this. My motive here is rather different, to lambaste injustice that I find near incomprehensible. Not only is the exciting true story of the rescue of great works of art from the Nazis during the latter parts of the war well told, the art direction capturing the devastation of the period is visually most impressive. If the film has a fault which places it on a lower level than such wartime epics as ""The Great Escape"" it is short on character development which tends to be swamped by emphasis on action. For once a better balance needs longer running time, rare to ask for from one of today's action flicks. Reports have it that George Clooney was deeply upset about the adverse reaction to what to all intents and purposes should have been a popular hit with audiences. If it is any consolation, George, I lapped it up and am probably as puzzled as you about the extent of such unjust denigration."
"Scarecrow-88","6","0","0","8 January 2015"," The Monuments Men
","Well, I have to be honest in that this has a fascinating story about how a certain group of art historians/restorers were put together by Frank Stokes (George Clooney who also directed) and assigned to find stolen works of art (by the Nazis and Hitler) in Europe as the Germans are on the verge of losing the war. The Russians are also securing what works Stokes and company is unable to. Cate Blanchett is Claire Simone, a French Resistance spy working as an art specialist with the Nazis and her assistance is desired by Matt Damon's James Granger. She just might know where the Nazis are taking specific works of art, and Granger will have to earn her trust. What Frank and his group want to do is find and return the art works to where they belong or in a safe place not to be exploited or kept buried in caves or mines. German soldiers are still out and about, so the Monuments Men (their title) will need to be careful (two of the men will die due to enemy fire). What one of the men dies for (the Madonna) is significantly desired by Frank, motivated by the death because he doesn't want him to have given his life in vain. With a absolutely terrific supporting cast (Bill Murray, with his share of deadpan comedy scenes (including the easing of a young German soldier and speaking about the likelihood of a mine Damon stands on being a dud), John Goodman, The Artist's Jean Dujardin (who steals the picture from his American counterparts), Bob Balaban (who has some really fun scenes opposite Murray), and Dimitri Leonidas (as a helpful soldier who speaks German)), The Monuments Men should be a homerun, but it settles on being a double in the outfield. The leisure pace, a surprising lack of suspense, and distinct approach that focuses less on the horrors of war and avoids the ugly aspects (and atrocities) of what the Nazis had committed in favor of the attaining of the art works, The Monuments Men will have a small audience, I'm afraid, that will appreciate and like it. With the kind of cast this movie has, it should be a certified hit, but the film just doesn't really leap from the screen and grab you. Every scene fails to really generate that thrill and excitement of ""the treasures hunt"" although I did feel Clooney and his filmmaking team care deeply about what the film represents. All that said, I didn't dislike it, and it has some nice moments here and there, with the performances respectable and commendable (if not extraordinary, I must sadly admit). Dujardin's charm and Murray and Balaban's rapport are some pleasant ingredients in the film. I think the mission is never in doubt, removing a key bit of tension, however. The acting in the film remains as reserved and relaxed as the pacing of the film. The period is well created by Clooney and his filmmaking team. Again, not a bad movie, just not the knockout it perhaps should have been."

But the Russian ""Trophy Brigade"" fills the gap and there is a lot of cross-cutting between the ugly, advancing Russians and the GIs trying to drive away with the loot before the Russians arrive.<br/><br/>The general theme is probably from ""The Train"", or maybe from Clooney's ""Three Kings;"" the idea of a group of comrades of disparate backgrounds resembles the Frank Sinatra movies with the Rat Pack; and a scene mourning the death of a friend, while the ironic ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas"" is sung in the background by somebody who sounds like Judy Garland, first appeared in ""The Victors."" No one really has a chance to display any acting chops. Clooney can be pretty good in the right role. His humor is dead pan. John Goodman, ditto; he was great in the Cohen's ""Barton Fink."" Matt Damon distinguished himself in a number of films. Bob Balaban is reliable, either as villain or as, here, a mousy Jewish professor. The best performance is given by Cate Blanchett, as a French resistance fighter. Maybe an award should be given to Holger Handtke as the Nazi officer who manages to maintain an expression that might have been carved in marble while he orders people about or is insulted while a prisoner. Also he resembles Michael Moriarty.<br/><br/>It's not a bad film, though I must say the musical score really sucks. It's just that it alternates clumsily between the wisecracking shenanigans of ""Kelly's Heroes"" and something resembling drama. Each opposition seems to drain much of the life out of the other.<br/><br/>Michelangelo's ""Madonna and Child,"" treated as the summum bonum of fine art, is worth drooling over. It's a fine, beautiful, and innovative piece of work. The Germans did in fact get it out to Germany and it was found considerably later and brought back to Bruges, where it now sits behind a shield of bulletproof glass so that no maniac attacks it with a hammer, as happened to Michelangelo's ""Pieta."""
"dglink","7","0","0","29 December 2014"," Clooney's Message about the Value of Art and Life
","Is a work of art, even one as irreplaceable as the Ghent Altarpiece or a Michelangelo Madonna, worth a man's life? Especially today, when extortionate museum admission charges reserve art for the privileged few. George Clooney clearly believes the answer is ""yes,"" and he hammers the message home as producer, writer, director, and star of his preachy film ""The Monuments Men."" Those dastardly Nazis strike again and loot Europe's museums and private collections with the intention of establishing a gigantic Fuehrer Museum in Germany. The stolen art works are shipped to the Fatherland, where they are hidden from advancing Allied forces, and Clooney and his team are assigned to retrieve and return the masterpieces.<br/><br/>With slick production values, the movie resembles a big-budget war movie from the 1960's and has a simplistic old-fashioned quality. The star-studded cast is also a throwback to earlier war films, although the A-list team is largely underused and under-challenged. George Clooney, Matt Damon, Bill Murray, and John Goodman play stock characters, while the charming Oscar winner Jean Dujardin is wasted in a small part. Only Cate Blanchett stands out as a member of the French resistance who has critical information about the missing art; Blanchett alone immerses herself in character, although her rapid attitude shift towards Damon may provoke whiplash in some.<br/><br/>Clooney has borrowed liberally from other war films, and references to ""The Battle of the Bulge"" and ""The Bridge at Remagen"" only remind viewers of even more. John Frankenheimer's ""The Train"" visually posed the same life vs art question, but Frankenheimer wisely left viewers to ponder the answer for themselves; Clooney does not trust his audience, but rather answers the question for them several times over. Clooney's use of the melancholy ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas"" pales in comparison to the unforgettable images that accompanied that song in John Foreman's grim and gritty film, ""The Victors."" Even the Spielbergian sentiment of the final scene evokes ""Saving Private Ryan."" Clooney's team faces hostility from their own troops, who are intent on victory, despite the cost to cultural treasures. Time also pressures them as the Russians move into German territory where the stolen works have been hidden; those nasty Russians intend to keep the purloined art for their own museums as war reparations. However, despite the pressures, the often naive team make time to pat each other on the back and smile smugly, hang American flags to taunt adversaries, stand in awe like schoolboys on a museum outing, and seemingly wander off sightseeing in enemy-held territory. While Clooney does a competent job under all four of his caps, ""The Monuments Men"" is a message picture wrapped in glossy trimmings. The film is not bad and retains viewer attention, but some may resent the preachings of a wealthy handsome Hollywood star and prefer to make up their own minds about the value of art vs human life."

","George Clooney's Monuments Men, Has been universally savaged in the German press (which I read regularly -- mainly the feulliton and kultur pages -- five daily newpapers!) -- and all Germans I have talked with about it personally, disliked it on various ""film critical"" grounds ~ typical clever comment: ""CLooney is a better actor than a director"" ~ ho- ho, Now ain't that clever... But, I liked it -- not as any profound oeuvre du cinema, but as straight forward Hollywood star entertainment about a very interesting subject -- period -- With good period reconstruction to boot. It's a typical sincere Clooneyesque attempt to make a 'meaningful picture' for the general public and simultaneously inform about a little known sideline story of WW II --- namely, the plundering of classic art by the Nazi pigwigs -- not that this subject hasn't been taken up before in other films -- but it nevertheless remains little known -- Okay, this is nowhere near the level of Clooney's study of E.R. Murrow ""Good night and good luck"" (Very well directed and acted!) -- but it isn't bad and it is a well structured piece of WW II entertainment in which you get to see a lot of familiar quality actors like John Goodman and Bill Murray in unfamiliar roles, plus, the WW II military costumery -- the period reconstruction, etc. With which I happen to very familiar, was very well done --so, in general : A Pretty good piece of historical entertainment .... In this writer's humble opinion, what the Germans really didn't like about this picture is the fact that it once again reminds the massive international public which is the automatic following of George Clooney, about just one more aspect of the collective criminality of the German People during those years ... I am sure that many Germans who on the surface dis-identify with the Nazis still, deep down, feel that Germany was ""entitled"" to the spoils of war after the humiliation of Versailles, 1919 -- in other words -- ahem, ahem -- and mind you, I like this country and have numerous personal friendships with all kinds of Germans - - I am convinced that a bit of admiration for Hitler and latent Naziism still lurks in the collective subconscious of this proud Merkelian nation -- including in the minds of many who are truly anti-Nazi and ashamed of how the Nazis besmirched the reputation of this country forever, in spite of Goethe, Beethoven, Wagner (!!) and all those other Geniuses who gave Germany such a high international rating ...prior to WW II -- The operative factor in terms of Collective Mentality -- is -- collective SHAME! .. And corresponding painful guilt feelings that need to be washed away! The Germans -- at least any German who has a shred of a conscience (gewissen) -- cannot help but feel some kind of shame deep down, because many Young Germans alive and active today in the New Germany -- still have -- like it or not --- grandfathers, grand- uncles, grand aunts and etcetera -- some of THEM -- still alive and kicking -- who were Concentration Camp guards and overseers, and Einsatz Gruppen members (common soldiers whose job it was to follow the main Wehrmacht east and ""mop up after them"" ) -- by simply mass murdering every Jew they could find -- old men women and children -- and these were ordinary Germans -- bank tellers and grocery store clerks in everyday life -- who willingly signed up for mass murder of innocent civilians even if they were not exactly card carrying Nazis. --- --- The bottom line is that a certain Nazi mentality is deeply embedded in the collective German mind, even today, although most good Germans would hate to admit it -- but it comes out indirectly, when the mass of Germans, whether film critics directly in print, or regular film goers who just love American movies -- feel a necessity ~~ yes, I would call it a necessity -- to condemn a movie like ""Monuments Men"" on (ahem) technical grounds ... When what they are really condemning is the constant reminders of the unbelievably gigantic crimes of their Immediate ancestors -- while not one word is ever said about the actual plundering their uncles and grandfathers committed in the name of The Greater Glory of Deutschland Über Alles ... And that's mah rooling -- Judge Roy Beane, Berlin. Feb. 21. 2014"

","What went wrong? Good story. Great cast. Good director. Good title. It should be monumental right? Everyone was anticipating it highly. Everyone was expecting it to be a big Oscar contender. However, it's safe to say the Oscars will stay far away from it. It may even get a few razzie nominations. A great cast try to save important art from the Nazis. It's based on a very interesting true story, and George Clooney's previous films as a director were well received. Some things in the movie world just can't be explained. This isn't a completely unforgivable movie. Cate Blanchett does a good job, and the actors aren't necessarily awful. It's a good story, so there's a certain level of interest to be had while watching it. There are some good looking bits and it gets a little better as it progresses once things actually start to happen. However, I cannot be expected to wait 70 minutes for the first act to end. The truth is, The Monuments Men is like waiting for a bus which never shows up for 118 minutes.<br/><br/>Despite it's great cast and good story TMM ruthlessly and cruelly wastes its potential with a movie so boring it feels like a parody of boring movies. It trudges along with a snail's pace and makes The Tree Of Life look like a John Woo action epic. The script is as bland as they come, and barely anything happens. The jokes feel stiff and awkward, the attempts at excitement provoke no kind of reaction and the storyline just drags on. There's almost nothing interesting about this movie at all. I didn't care about anything and the fact that much of it was juggling 4 different sets of events in 4 different places, my attention was lost early on. It's got a good soundtrack but that's about it. The trailers looked promising and they were good because despite the lack of exciting stuff in the trailers at least we didn't know everything that happens. That's because nothing much really happens and there wasn't a lot to show.<br/><br/>4/10"
"thomas-w15","2","0","0","22 November 2014"," Biggest Disappointment of the year!!!!
","The Monuments Men 2/10- Everything about this movie makes you think that it will be a hit. It has got George Clooney as the director and star, Matt Damon as the other lead, Bill Murray, Jean Dujardin, Cate Blanchett, I mean that cast alone screams this movie will be awesome. Plus, the source material that this movie is based off of is very interesting and definitely deserves to be told. What could go wrong? Everything. Everything went wrong. I do not know how all of these great factors leads to such a terrible movie. The Monuments Men is one of those movies that after twenty minutes of watching, you feel like you have been there for an hour. <br/><br/>I will begin with the score. A score is the entire music made for a particular movie. In almost all of the movies I have seen, the music only enhances the viewing experience and adds something special to each individual scene. Then there are these handful of movies I have seen where the music makes each scene worse, the monuments men is unfortunately one of those few. During this movie, there will be this poorly written inspirational speech or emotional scene and someone during this the music will start playing.Even if this speech was the greatest movie speech ever written, the music made for the Monuments Men would have ruined it and would have made you hate speech. To be honest, I have never disliked any music for a particular movie more than this one.<br/><br/>Now for the plot. The Monuments Men has a particular interesting plot at first because it cultivates a patriotic World War II theme whilst still maintaining an intellectual background with the artists and sculptors being on the front line. The Trailer makes it look very clear cut, they all go in together and find the art throughout Europe and bring it back to its rightful owners. Everyone that I know was excited for this film just because of the trailer, but sadly that's the only good thing about this movie, the trailer. We saw the only good parts of the plot in the trailer. When the actually movie begins, the audience suddenly realizes right away that is very poorly written movie and the rest of the movie they hope that at least is will get a little better. Nope, somehow it gets progressively worse throughout the entire movie. I do not want to give away any particular details about The Monuments Men if for some reason you want to see this movie after reading this review. <br/><br/>Last and definitely least the acting. How can a cast that has one more than five Oscars not deliver an outstanding performance? I have no clue. What did they do differently this time? Why were they so terrible in this film? It is honestly a mystery, but the main suspect is George Clooney who did not show any solid directing skills from this work. I am not going to point out any particular person for bad acting in this film because all of them were just as bad as the next and for some of them it was the worst performances of their career. <br/><br/>To sum it all up, bad music, bad plot, and bad acting. This is the first movie that I strongly recommend you do not even see when it comes out on DVD. <br/><br/>For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com"

Like I said the actors are first rate. but are really not used very well. Other people have said that Blanchett gets the show, but there is nothing to really steal from this, however I will say that the fact that Art was part of the plot was very smart.<br/><br/>There were also 3 or 4 times where I was thinking that something crazy exciting was going to happen on screen, but the subject and action ended abruptly and the boring and easily dialogue was at it again.<br/><br/>I still recommend the experience, since its more of a smart movie with great cast, just don't get fooled by the Army costumes, not much action hence the title."

","George Clooney took (from what brief research I did on the events)an important story and something by the sounds of it is really worth telling and essentially just made OCEANS ELEVEN. It's a bunch of actors running about together having fun (though half the time it seems like some of the cast neither wants to be there or even cares slightly, yes we're looking at you Bill Murray). It's dull, thinks it has some sense of pedigree with it's all star cast and Clooney behind the camera and it's just full of boring stereotypes and clichés.

","Frank Stokes (George Clooney) puts together a rag tag group to try to save precious art from from being destroyed by the Nazi's.<br/><br/>The Monuments Men is George Clooney's sixth try at directing. Clooney wrote, produced, directed and stared in Monuments Men. To say the least, this movie is his baby. The cast is great for any movie, Matt Damon, Bill Murray, Kate Blanchett, John Goodman, just to name a few. A real powerhouse cast. Sadly to say this doesn't help the movie in any way. The acting is very dry and almost every scene is lined up for a one line punch line in the end that just falls short. I kept hoping for the action to pick up in some way but it just never does. It's a very slow movie. There are some funny moments and the locations are great. George Clooney couldn't direct himself in this movie and that is why his performance is the only one that doesn't come across as dry."

The ""Monuments Men,"" were a group of approximately 345 men and women from thirteen nations, most of whom volunteered for service in the newly created MFAA section during World War II. Many had expertise as museum directors, curators, art historians, artists, architects, and educators. Their job description was simple: to protect cultural treasures so far as war allowed. The character of Claire Simone, played by Cate Blanchett appears to have been based on Rose Valland, a Parisian museum curator who was drafted by the Nazis during the occupation of Paris to assist with art acquisitions. As depicted in this film and in the documentary The Rape of Europa (2006), Valland secretly kept a detailed ledger of all works that passed through Nazi hands, the original (often Jewish) owner of each work, and the location in Germany where each item was eventually transported. GOOFS- When US Army Lieutenant James Granger visits the apartment of Claire Simon, he is not wearing his uniform but is wearing a casual, short-sleeve shirt instead. During World War II, it was a strict rule that members of the military had to wear their uniforms at all times, on and off base, even while home on leave. Liberated Paris in 1944 was still considered a war zone, making his disregard for uniform especially egregious.<br/><br/>*Emotion- It is an extremely satisfying plot and enlightening story.

","The story is about a group of artists who are trying to find the stolen artifacts before the Germans destroy them, during World War two. So the story is a real one, but that's the only thing that makes this movie interesting. The story line is so badly that bores you, tires you up, confuses you and then you find yourself at the end of the movie, wondering what happened. The truth is that it is a bad movie. Not because of the performances, they are great, and not because of the main idea behind it, it's actually interesting, but I think that the film was such a disappointment because it wasn't ""made"" well. The direction of it is poorly, the actions scenes boring, the soundtrack too cliché. In the end, the story rushes up to a quick finale with a mention to the present and that's it. So 2 out of 10."

"rogerdarlington","Null","0","0","19 October 2014"," Unlike so much of the art saved, not a masterpiece
","This is a war movie with a difference: instead of being about killing men, it is about saving cultural works. Set in the second half of the Second World War, it is the loosely true story of how the Allies put together a team of art specialists - in what was formally called the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives section - to don army uniform and follow hard behind combat troops as they liberated Western Europe from the Nazis. Thhe film has references at the beginning and the end to the magnificent Ghent Altarpiece which I have seen and admired - just one of millions of artefacts rescued by this operation.<br/><br/>There were in fact around 345 such Monuments Men (and women) from up to 17 nations, but inevitably the movie has to focus on a small number - just seven - and almost all of them are played by big name American actors including George Clooney, Matt Damon, Bill Murray and John Goodman. Britain is represented by Hugh Bonneville, while France has Jean Dujardin, and for good measure we have the ever-wonderful Cate Blanchett.<br/><br/>So such an interesting story and stellar cast would seem to promise a high-class movie, but sadly it is a rather flawed work. The sweep is so extensive that we have a series of episodes involving different characters and locations with a lack of real narrative drive. Also the script is rather weak and the overall approach too comedic for such a serious subject. The responsibility for both strengths and weaknesses has to be shouldered largely by George Clooney since he is director, co-producer and co-writer as well as the lead actor. I am a huge admirer of Clooney's work but this, while well-intentioned, is not his best.<br/><br/>In Britain, the is a particular reservation about ""The Monuments Men"" because the character portrayed by Bonneville - one of the two MPAA officers killed on duty - is fictional and there is no reference to the real-life British hero Ronald Balfour who was killed saving church artefacts in Cleves."

","I heard about this wartime film a good amount during its cinema release, I was definitely going to watch it at some point because of the all-star cast, I ignored low critic ratings, directed by George Clooney (Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, Good Night, and Good Luck.). Based on a true story, set in 1943 during World War II, victory may be close against the Nazis, but Lt. Frank Stokes (George Clooney) hears that Hitler is stealing all of the great works of art for his personal Führermuseum in Linz, he convinces U.S. President Roosevelt that victory will be meaningless if art treasures of Western civilisation are lost in the fighting. Stokes is directed to assemble an Army unit nicknamed the ""Monuments Men"" comprising museum directors, curators and art historians to search for stolen art and return it to the rightful owners. Stokes recruits Lt. James Granger (Matt Damon), Sgt. Richard Campbell (Bill Murray), Sgt. Walter Garfield (John Goodman), British Lt. Donald Jeffries (Downton Abbey's Hugh Bonneville), French Lt. Jean Claude Clermont (The Artist's Jean Dujardin) and Pvt. Preston Savitz (Friends' Bob Balaban), all of whom work together going behind enemy lines to retrieve the stolen art before it is lost or destroyed. The unit split in certain missions and have varied success together and individually, this includes Granger in occupied France in Paris getting help from curator Claire Simone (Cate Blanchett), but tragedy befalls the group when Jeffries is killed trying to prevent the theft of the Madonna and Child by Michelangelo, and again later when Clermont is mortally wounded during a patrol. However the team never give up hope that they will find and save many influential and important paintings and sculptures, one of the most successful finds is in an abandoned mine filled with over 16,000 art pieces and gold assets, in the end Stokes reports to the President that vast quantities of artworks and culturally significant items are recovered, he requests further searching and restoration in Europe, and the memory of this success seems to have remained in thirty years in 1977 where the elderly Stokes (Nick Clooney) visits appreciated art pieces that were found. Also starring Dimitri Leonidas as Sam Epstein, Sam Hazeldine as Colonel Langton, Miles Jupp as Major Feilding, Alexandre Desplat as Emile, Grant Heslov as Doctor and Christian Rodska as President Truman. The all-star cast members all do their parts very well, even the underused, and despite maybe some tiny glitches the story is inspiring at the right moments, as well as being interesting, funny and dramatic, I will agree any romantic element between Blanchett and Damon is forgettable, and it is hard to keep in parts, but overall I personally liked it, a likable Second World War comedy drama. Worth watching!"

","If there was ever a movie that screamed Oscars, critical fawning and audience love, surely it would be The Monuments Men? You can only imagine the pitch to frothing studio execs, World War 2 – check, adventure – check, an all-star cast lead and directed by George Clooney – check, art – check, hijinks – check. The whole package was there for Monuments Men to be the awards baiting, audience feel good hit of the year but somewhere, somehow the film become a meandering mediocre effort that while enjoyable is less the sum of its very interesting parts.<br/><br/>One of the most tonally uneven films you're likely to see this year, Monuments has an awkward and unsubstantial beginning that sadly never eventuates into anything more than a slight care or interest thanks to a haphazard displaying of the events at its disposal. Clooney has over a period of years now showcased himself as a fine director but much like his flop Leatherheads, Monuments shows him at his most vulnerable, a director unsure of how to use his cast and transform his story to screen. What should've been one of this year's most endearing team ups of actors is somehow allowed to grow apart into a rag tag everyman for himself like gang with not enough screen time granted to anyone in particular to make a real mark. Murray and Bob Balaban make the most of their artistry types and Goodman has his moments but even these fine character actors struggle to really come to grips with their players in a story that deserved so much more.<br/><br/>Telling an oft forgotten and incredibly interesting side to the World War 2 story in the form of Hitler's fascination with collecting art and in many instances destroying it and the lengths brave men went to to save these parts of human history is a tale well worth the big screen treatment. While Clooney and his team at times convey this sense of purpose it would be wrong to suggest they make the most of it. Clooney seems content in going for easy emotional wrenching scenes (a scene set during Xmas example of this) but does so without really earning it. For a film like this to succeed, audiences need to be fully invested in the plight and the characters, something Monuments just does not draw out of us despite it's easy to like attitude and breezy men on a mission structure.<br/><br/>A huge disappointment yet still a movie far better than your average jaunt, The Monuments Men may be perfect for a night in with a movie yet you can't help but shake the feeling this one should have been oh so much more than it is, you can bet your bottom dollar that the studio executives felt the same.

She meets Matt Damon, not a very believable role as an art expert. George Clooney leads the gang of old fart art guys brought into the WW2 to save art being stolen by the Nazis. <br/><br/>The director played up the cuteness of these guys, while trying to instill some seriousness, like getting shot at, or even death. There was a little tension built up at the end, but don't expect much of that. The guys like Goodman and Murray played well. You end up respecting how much the real monument men really did to save the world's art treasures. <br/><br/>I was thinking 6, or 7 out of 10. But I think because of Blanchet, and some strong bit acting by German characters, it is a film that you would like despite some miscasting, and not enough time spent on the talents of Goodman and Murray.

The biggest problem that kept me from really getting into this movie the way I wanted to was the fact the film felt very sloppy in its plot. There's no real tension or drama going on as the Monuments Men do their stuff and all their actions and activities feel sporadic and non-cohesive. Nothing they do in the plot feels like it is working towards any real major goal and it gives the film a feeling of being incomplete. Additionally, the lack of any real character development and an overall weak introduction to the characters didn't help either.<br/><br/>I really wanted to like this film and, while it has some enjoyable moments with a great cast, the film just wasn't what my expectations were expecting it to be.

","The flag at the end of the movie (the one they left for the Russians) had 50 stars. In 1945 there were only 48. <br/><br/>I didn't really think this movie needed to be made at all. There are so many other, more poignant things about the second world war that could be told, or at the minimum rolled into the story line of the movie. The idea (seemingly over and over) that lives were being lost and yet these clowns were looking for art, just made the whole story line uninteresting to me. Was it worth it? Of course, but the sheer numbers of innocents killed during that conflict - to me, makes the art secondary. <br/><br/>OK... the drums of gold nuggets made the movie for me."

","I was interested in this film having recently seen a documentary about the actual events. I had no expectations so wasn't disappointed but felt that I had gone back in time - not to the war but back to the sixties when war films had lots of jolly music and there was no blood and gore. A touch of 'Where Eagles; Dare,' or Guns of Navarone. The heroes were all decent chaps and the Germans were all nasties. I enjoyed watching it, but it was like a kid's film. There was a hint of a love interest between Cate Blanchett's character and Mat Damon but it was rather ridiculous as the characters had no sexual chemistry at all. The other characters were all one dimensional and John Goodman trying to look sensitive involved him grimacing for most of the movie. I think maybe George Clooney should have left either the directing or the writing to someone else - perhaps he is trying to do too much."

I understand that the men charged with retrieving the priceless works were not full-on soldiers, but I am sure there was more drama that could have been explored instead of making an attempt at a ""statement piece."" I appreciate the story for its historical worthiness, but it was too slow and had far too many dead spots in it. If the goal was to make the story last the entire 118 minutes, then why not work more on the epilogue? 20 minutes of a recap on where a piece of art was rescued from and where it lives today would have been extremely informative and added more of a connection to the history of these events. Seeing artwork in a museum and understanding the rescue from destruction that took place in order for us to see it is something that makes the events more tangible and real for those who can only read about these events."

It is a shame that most viewers will not know the identity of the heroes (and heroine) that lived this historical drama.

"ransford","4","0","0","7 August 2014"," Disappointing
","Rented this movie from Red Box at my grocery store. Glad I did not pay a theater price. I read several negative reviews and found they nailed the defects I noted while watching--too many humorous one-liners in a serious story, irrelevant references in subtitles to WWII events, e.g., Omaha Beach, Battle of the Bulge, which had no tie-in to the plot; one- dimensional characters, silly musical score; caricatured Germans, Russians, even the French. Did Cate Blanchett portray a real person, or was she just the romantic episode Hollywood requires even in a film about soldier-boys. <br/><br/>I was an art history major as an undergraduate so I was sympathetic to the plight of rescuing great art stolen by the Nazis. I revere the Ghent altarpiece and Michelangelo's Madonna and Child, but I fear those who do not share my feelings may not have been convinced they were worthy of the deaths of allied soldiers.<br/><br/>Many years ago I saw ""The Train,"" which told a similar story about a train full of French art loaded on a train headed for Germany. The story was probably apocryphal or a liberal twist from the story of the recovery of stolen art, but it starred two great actors, Burt Lancaster and Paul Scofield and was told in a consistent time-line in which time was of the essence, tension unrelieved except for poignant moments of knowing looks between Burt and Jeanne Moreau, whom I confess I adore. No time for romance. In that movie, only the German colonel (Scofield) appreciated the paintings, the others just knew they were trying to save the national treasure. Therein lay the power of the film, its understatement. ""The Monuments Men,"" by contrast, kept saying they were saving 1000 years of culture, not really convincing me that these shallow characters really cared.<br/><br/>In fact, the trailer was better than the film because you get the point and use your imagination to fill in all the parts that should have been in the script. Although Clooney is credited with the screenplay, I have the feeling that too many cooks spoiled the broth. I used to think Clooney was just a pretty face until I saw a few memorable performances; now I think he is just a pretty face."

","""The Monument's Men"" feels almost like a heist movie set during WWII. A group of ""art collectors"" are recruited to steal back valuable art pieces that the Nazis have absconded from invaded countries. These individuals are called ""The Monument's Men"" hence the title. A-list actors play these men: John Goodman, Matt Damon, George Clooney, Jean Dujardin, Bill Murray, Bill Balaban, and Hugh Bonneville. Based on a true story, this film seems like a fun one to watch. The trailers played it out as a comedy thriller with spurts of action. However, in watching it, the film is anything but that. <br/><br/>Also in the director and writer's chair, Clooney takes the approach of seriousness, dates, and a timeline of facts. The focus is more on how the art pieces are found rather than the individuals who achieved these actions. In this regard, the movie wanders from one event to another, without giving the audience enough flamboyant characters. I relish that Clooney has made a WWII picture, but it is dull. I love all the actors in this film, but they don't do a thing here in entertainment. Clooney and Damon are bland. Goodman and Dujardin are incredibly limited. Murray tries to act serious, but just looks sleepy. Balaban has the only energy present as the mousy private. A misleading trailer and cast simply going through the motions kills it. In an attempt to add an emotional impact, there is a scene where a Christmas song plays at a military base where soldiers are wounded and dying. What could have been an engaging moment delivers as a failed method of moving the audience. <br/><br/>Alexandre Desplat's score is meant to be moving but feels shallow and hokey. The rest of the movie runs into this problem. I want to take it seriously, but I can't. How the monument's men searched and found the art pieces is the only thing that keep this movie going. This was enough for me to sit through it. I really wanted to like the movie. The Monument's Men is not monumentalit is average. Nick Clooney gets a good cameo at the end by the way."

","Does art belong to one man or all mankind? The Monuments Men believed it was their duty to scour Europe during World War 2 to find the paintings, sculptures, and other artifacts stolen by Hitler for his own personal library and return them to their rightful owners. Over the course of the film we follow Matt Damon, George Clooney, Cate Blanchett, Bill Murray and John Goodman to see how all of this unfolded.<br/><br/>While lighthearted there was a desperate tone to the film at times. We get to watch the tone of the film change from the Americans trying to get to the stolen art then we get to see the Germans desperate attempt to destroy the art they have stolen. Towards the end of the film we get to witness the race to get the Ghent Altarpiece and the Madonna out of Germany before the Russians take over after the end of the European campaign. The film cuts back and forth between the Russians racing down the street while US soldiers push a cart loaded with statues out of a mine really drive home the race against time.<br/><br/>One of the scenes I found interesting was when Walter Garfield, played by John Goodman and his partner Preston Savitz played by Bob Balaban stumble upon a ""French"" farmer who is studying art. As they look at his collection they slowly realize that these pieces are stolen and not just replicas as he mentioned before. We see many shots of the farmer and former SS member fiddling with his hands, and as Savitz asks him if his wife speaks English you have a feeling this could get ugly quickly. This scene reminds me of the scene in Inglorious Basterds during Operation Kino. The tension is not as palpable in The Monuments Men. I don't think matching that scene would have fit the nature of this film but I got the same butterflies during both of these scenes.<br/><br/>The film did have a few laughable moments here and there, mostly in the form of one-liners and kill Hitler jokes. However the film never strayed from the point that this really was a once in a lifetime mission and our soldiers would stop at nothing to see this art returned to its rightful place."

","Although this is a strange War movie , let me say a number of pro's in favour of George Clooney being a great Director .

Yet , he has finally shown us that all his movie experience was worthwhile in this superbly directed movie . And I hope to see many more of his directions in the future . Well I personally compared the Monuments Men , with Argo by Ben Affleck who is another actor with excellent directional skills , and seems to be in the same boat here . Now about the movie.. it is an involving story , based on fact , but the real Monuments Men were actually younger than the actors , or certainly seemed to be . George has packed the movie with well known American performers such as his old movie buddy , Matt Damon , along with John Goodman (also in Argo) and Bill Murray . Popular British actor , Hugh Bonneville , and popular French actor , Jean Dujardin , are also in the movie . Cate Blanchett provides an outstanding performance as Claire Simone , the former spy -French Liaison with the Allies . Dimitri Leonidis was also a standout in the movie as Private Epstein , the former German-Jew helping the Monuments team .

The cast has good chemistry, but I feel like there was missing bits of information and character development. <br/><br/>The actors are all good in it. The performance that stood out to me was Bill Murray. He always does a good job of blending humor with deep emotions. I enjoyed Clooney's style for the film. It feels like a 1940s patriotic war film in color. Alexandre Desplat's score complements this style. It works for the story, but it doesn't strike much depth about patriotism. It's a film made for the love of classic artwork and the importance of preserving the art that has defined humans. You feel that importance at times, but it becomes muddled in a rushed story that aims for jokes more often than needed.<br/><br/>Clooney means well with ""The Monuments Men,"" but it's a flawed film that probably needed more time in order for it to be completely told.

"Xyleigh","10","0","0","23 June 2014"," No Monuments Were Saved in the Making of this Movie
","In 2014 ""The Monuments Men"" directed by George Clooney was released, starring a questionable group of men tasked with the mission of rescuing artworks stolen by the Nazis. During World War Ⅱ, U.S. President Roosevelt (Michael Dalton) ordered these men with the mission of making sure the art treasures of the Western World survive the war; this army unit comprised of seven curators, museum directors, and art historians. With the help of members of the French Resistance, such as the French art historian Claire Simone (Cate Blanchett), these men carried out the task of recovering and delivering the masterpieces to their rightful owners. This group of remarkable men would eventually suffer the loss of two members, Donald Jeffries (Hugh Bonneville) and Jean Claude Clermont (Jean Dujardin); instead of this causing their resolve to falter it strengthened the men and their belief that their mission was worth carrying onwards. After the Nero Decree was issued by Hitler (James Payton) on the 19th of March the Monuments Men had to go into overdrive, not only did they have to recover the millions of pieces of art stolen by the Nazis but also retrieve them before the Russian equivalent troops seize the artworks with no intention of returning them. <br/><br/>While the dialogue of the film is captivating, there are two recurring underlying messages. The general argument in the film is that during war that the missions should not be an either/or stance,that it is both equally important to save both the people and their culture. While some argue that these men should have been more involved with aiding the Allies in stopping the Holocaust, they were not men that were going to change anything the tide in that battle, but they could preserve who they were as a people. This is best demonstrated in the movie when one of the men returns a stolen painting to the empty house of a Jew, simply because it belonged there. The other central theme was whether a soldier's life is worth risking and potentially losing over a painting or a statue. The director, through the compelling stories of bravery of the men, makes a strong case for the belief that saving the world is about more than just saving its people. <br/><br/>This movie is precious to me; the saving of art is equally as important as the saving the people. In the beginning fifteen minutes of the movie George Clooney's character states that, ""Your lives are more important than a piece of art,"" and it was not until the death of two team members that he realized this was not the case. His voice overlaps the scene of Jean Claude's death and his earlier opinion of their cause is changed when he expresses, ""No piece of art was worth a mans life. But these last months have proved me wrong. This is our history and it is not to be stolen or destroyed. It is to be held up and admired."" During war towns will fall and people will die but who we are as humans must survive. Our achievements are important and are worth protecting no matter the cost."

George Clooney tried matching his directorial talents to his artistic ego, and failed. Perhaps Clooney gets an A for effort and for his heart being in the right place. And perhaps ""The Monuments Men"" is an enjoyable movie for some or for many; but it is a poor portrayal of serious persons as entertaining pantomimes. A problem shared by many that exist in the insularity of Hollywood is a breakdown along the lines that separate reality from entertainment. Moviegoers tend to be less-and-less patient with reading and less-and-less finical about authenticity. Even the wading through title of Robert M. Edsel's non-fiction work, ""The Monuments Men: Allied Heroes, Nazi Thieves and the Greatest Treasure Hunt in History and Saving Italy: The Race to Rescue a Nation's Treasures from the Nazis,"" they would find exhausting.

","I seriously don't understand why the critics seem to hate on this film. I personally loved it. I love the characters, the acting, the theme especially. In fact I am listening to the theme right now as I'm writing this. The plot is that during World War 2, the Nazis have stolen all the famous pieces of art from the conquered territories. Reichmarshall Hermann Goering (Udo Kroschwald) has decided to make a Fuhrer Museum with the help of Senior Lance Corporal Viktor Stahl (Justus Von Dohnányi). Meanwhile over in the United States Lieutenant Frank Stokes (George Clooney) has gained permission from Franklin Delano Roosevelt (Michael Dalton) to create a platoon called the Monuments Men to recover the Art stolen by the Nazis. It includes Lieutenant James Granger (Matt Damon), Sergeant Richard Campbell (Bill Murray), Sergeant Walter Garfield (John Goodman), Private Preston Savitz(Bob Balaban), Jean Claude Clermont (Jean Dujardin), Lieutenant Donald Jeffries (Hugh Bonneville), and Sam Epstein (Dimitri Leonidas). They go all over France shortly after D-Day to recover some of the Art. They later advance through France and find more and more places where the Art is stolen. But they lose Jean Claude Clermont and Lieutenant Jeffries. But eventually all art is taken by the monuments men and is returned to their owners. I think that this film has been unfairly judged by the critics, because I sure loved it. It's fun, it's funny, and it's an all around great film."

","For the most part, this film is clear on what it wants to present and with the talent involved, you would think the result would be splendid. While the movie isn't terrible, it has few redeeming qualities which is a shame, since I had high hopes for it. The plot sees a group of men, spearheaded by Clooney's character, who are looking to preserve the works of art that are being threatened by Hitler's path of destruction. In a movie like this I would think there would be a linear story and strong personalities in the characters. Instead we get boring mumbling about some other stuff, with the objective of the mission being neglected at times. Being a history buff I hate to side with those who claim it to be a waste of time, but with this case I have to agree. While I did enjoy some of the guys having fun doing this movie (e.g. Bill Murray), this isn't enough to make the movie great. I believe Clooney can do more in the directing and writing department, and I hope his next project is more thought out. In the meantime, I must say that The Monuments Men failed to impress me.<br/><br/>Rating: 6/10"

","The message here, of course, is the value of culture and art as opposed to human lives, but that's putting it simply.<br/><br/>Clooney and company make it clear they aren't justifying murder for art's sake, or justifying the deaths of the many people who built the wall of China.<br/><br/>A group of middle aged men, experts mostly in art, volunteer during World War II to salvage art stolen by the Nazis, some of it meant to be destroyed, much of it meant initially to be reissued as ""Nazi propaganda"" with the extermination of everyone who would say otherwise, and when the war is nearly lost, obviously meant for use as a fortune stock pile for Nazis to buy their lives with.<br/><br/>The volunteers aren't vital to any other effort of the war, and this is what they want to do. They are determined to risk only their own lives, and that is an important cog of this story.<br/><br/>The film has poor sound quality, and you need closed captioning, so it's hard to give a high score to, but it is otherwise well directed and written, with the liberties of the facts taken not too extensive. It isn't like the crazy OK Corral stories we have gotten from Hollywood.<br/><br/>""Culture"" is not only overrated, as the characters here overrate it, but it is in fact responsible for almost all atrocities. Pol Pot even felt his sadistic Khmer Rouge was his own ""culture"" and ""art"". Should that be salvaged? If Hitler won the war, and exterminated all who questioned him, the very art that was the culture for other people would be the ""art"" and ""culture"" of his Reich, of his Satanic cult of Nazis, virtually the hand picked most demonic of the German people. It would then be heralded as their work, and be their ""culture"". Don't think it couldn't happen.<br/><br/>The good news is that the film doesn't preach the point to us, but only states that ""culture"" and ""art"" is that important to the ""monument men"" who risk their lives. This is important to remember."

Especially the 'have yourself a merry little Christmas scene, just tear your heart out. I was very happy with the cast, I felt like they all had a role and they weren't there typical selves. Bill Murray was the main one I was worried about, I thought he would just turn out to be the comic relief and over play it but I thought he did very well. The tempo the movie was very strange to me, at first it was moving too fast and at other times I felt it was too slow, which threw me off for a bit.

This subject matter is serious stuff and is of tremendous interest to those who know art and culture and have an appreciation of it. For some reason, George Clooney decided this should be a quasi-comedy which is dangerous turf when dealing with Nazi themed subject matter, even in the best of hands. Clearly Mr. Clooney might want to stick to acting. Others have already stated the flaws in this movie and I reluctantly have to agree with them. My wife and son felt the same.

This was the kind of film that, six months ago, you wouldn't have looked foolish staking on it as an Oscar winner. So where'd it all go wrong? It sticks to the facts perfectly but it bores as we spend too much time watching Stokes put his team together and that's too long. Cast is simply impressive but it's not enough to make a really good story out of it, because actors don't match one another that much, with Goodman and Dujardin being a funny double act and with Matt Damon's terrible French.

","I loved this book, and worried when I saw that George Clooney was writing the screenplay, not that he isn't a multi-talented artist, but it's such a serious subject and he plays more ""light-hearted"" roles and I was afraid it would not be as serious a product as it should be. I hoped I wouldn't be disappointed in the movie, but unfortunately my instincts were correct. It just wasn't very good. I believe that if he had followed the book it would have had more coherence and flow. I wondered why he chose to change the characters' names. He considered in a fleeting way the backgrounds of the main characters, allowing their biographies to be revealed as the movie progressed rather than identifying them and their expertise at the beginning to help set the stage. I was anxious to see the story of how the Jewish boy ended up being the Monument Man, having his experience as a child come full circle in finding his grandfather's prints, but alas, there was only a brief mention of that. To be honest, there wasn't much of this movie that held my interest. To be fair, the art work was the best part. I felt like I was watching Danny Ocean solicit men to do a heist. It was really poor quality, in my estimation, and it could have been a great addition to anyone's DVD library."

","What a waste of talent, great potential of a story that should be told, with great actors, but lousy composition, script and directing. Certainly one of George Clooney's big flops. This needs to be re-made better. While it's based on true events, it really is a bit like the typical American/John Wayne movies, they are the good guys, out to 'save the world' and it's art from the Germans as well as the Russians (But lets not worry about the Thieving British and the Parthenon Marbles still in the British Museum). Great idea, but the storyline as depicted in the movie is rather disjoint and ridiculous: and very likely an embellished Hollywood account of actual events. A team of 8 scholars and museum curators, get some basic military training (and lets not worry about passing the army medical, or if some were close to retirement age) and are sent into enemy territory to track-down, identify and retrieve great works of art. Now if they were all given the rank of Major or above, they may have had better luck and support from their own forces, or better still assigned with a dozen 'real' soldiers to assist and protect them when they do encounter the enemy. As a movie it's all over the place, nothing really holds it together, just repetitive melodrama spread across about half a dozen missions. But it does make you think about the value of a life vs art, especially the difference between that of a German vs American soldier's life."

Fortunately, we rented the movie for only $1.28 and didn't suffer a major financial loss. <br/><br/>It must take exceptional talent to combine such an intriguing story with a killer cast and end up with a total waste of film. The acting is so low key that Clooney and Damon both seem to be hooked on Valium. Plus, if there's a war going on, it's hard to tell. The cast spends most of their time sitting amidst rubble but rarely do you hear gunshots.<br/><br/>If you spend more than $1.28 to see this boring mess, then you are being foolish.

"Robert_duder","7","0","0","22 May 2014"," Interesting story but perhaps too much ego/charisma in one film?
","The Monuments Men is a fascinating project. On one hand it is a really interesting twist on a World War 2 story. On the other hand I'm not sure it was enough to create a two hour film around. Clooney is talented in many ways and while I've never been a huge fan of his I can't deny his talent and charisma in Hollywood. There are some genuinely moving moments in the film but it also struggles to capture the sort of intensity and emotional upheaval of the war though it does try. The subject matter is almost too light given the setting. It doesn't have near the range of intensity of films like Warhorse or Schindler's List. This cast is very near stunning. However, part of that problem might be too many stars and not enough coverage for their characters and time for them to do what we all love them to do best. The film makers may have been better off finding a smaller, lesser known cast to tell this story. Still, the unique angle and the fun chemistry between the cast makes for an entertaining and decent World War 2 picture. I felt like, despite it being delayed for several months, the script and direction could have used a little fine tuning or something more added.<br/><br/>As I said George Clooney is very hit and miss for me. I know how talented he is and he is the epitome of modern day Hollywood royalty and I respect him for that. I have seen in roles I've loved and some I've hated and everywhere in between. I don't know where this performance sits because he definitely tones it back to make room for the other stars but maybe he's toned back too much. He doesn't make much of a splash and his performance is almost boring at times which is unfortunate. Matt Damon was one of the better characters but also was victim to getting not enough development. He provides some moments of one-liner humour which still seems strange to me but somehow it works. Clooney and he definitely have good chemistry and that helps. The supporting cast in the film are all terrific but none of them get the screen time they deserve and they all seem to have terrific back stories that we never really get to find out about. Bill Murray, John Goodman, Jean Dujardin, Hugh Bonneville and Bob Balaban all have one or two great scenes and together they are terrific but there is too many of them and not enough space for their stories. There is this hint of this clever and fun little rivalry between Balaban and Murray but that never takes off and the back story of Bonneville is great but we never really get to explore that and Dujardin's heroic tale gets mostly lost. Literally the actress I cannot stand most in the world (just edging out Jessica Chastain) is Cate Blanchett. She is the most over-rated and irritating actress. Fortunately her role in this is nearly pointless and she hardly gets any time to get under my skin. She is forgettable at best in this film. There is a whole sub story between her and Damon that never goes anywhere either.<br/><br/>It may seem like I'm trashing this movie and I don't mean to. There were good scenes, some fun and some touching moments but nothing is as powerful as it should be because its simply too crowded with cast and story and not enough depth to the important things. This would have made a heck of a TV series with Spielberg behind it because they could have explored these great characters. The script is actually very good but not right for a feature length film. Production value is excellent and two scenes that stand out is Damon and his landmine incident and the very moving scene in the middle of the film with a melancholy Christmas carol playing. This cast is grade A superb and none of the faults of this film are on them. It just could have been so much more. Perhaps it was rushed after all. Still you won't be disappointed per se and it you will enjoy it but it won't blow very many people away and for being what it is, I think it will mostly be forgettable which is unfortunate to me. 7/10"

That's how I felt with The Monuments Men.<br/><br/>As far as the storyline, I had no idea that Hitler amassed such a monumental collection of the world's masterpieces while conquering Europe. When I initially saw the trailer for the movie, I thought it would be an interesting flick of war intrigue. To my horror, about half way through I kept fiddling with the stop button on my TV wanting to escape.<br/><br/>I cannot put my finger on any one thing as to why this movie doesn't work. Since George Clooney and Matt Damon star in the film, maybe I was hoping for a WWII version of Oceans 11 where the gang steals back valuable artwork from the bad guys. There are great actors, but mediocre performances. Even George Clooney had little spark, like the landmine that barely blows in one scene. <br/><br/>The film lacks conflict and intrigue. The only thing that did ruffle my feathers were the Germans stealing, stashing,and destroying the masterpieces from great artists. As the war is ending, The Monuments Men take on the task of finding, salvaging, and returning the stolen treasures.<br/><br/>Of course, there are undertones of more being destroyed than art. There is the terrible confiscation of Jewish property, even down to barrels full of gold fillings taken from the mouths of victims. It is a sobering reminder that more than art had been lost during the war, and perhaps we should care about human lives rather than a Rembrandt.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, it is true that our greatest achievements as human beings should be preserved. Hitler wanted to conquer more than land and human beings, he wanted to conquer and own all of the art created by master artists of centuries past. Two men gave up their lives to preserve and reclaim the artwork. The only question left for the audience to ponder, is whether the price of a human life is worth the preservation of a Rembrandt."

A director known to regularly punch above his weight in Clooney. Seems nothing can go wrong with The Monuments Men. A surefire sleeper hit, and a strong awards contender, is it? Not really. The movie is a prime example of the fact that great ingredients do not necessarily make a great movie.<br/><br/>""You can wipe out an entire generation, you can burn their homes to the ground and somehow they'll still find their way back. But if you destroy their history, you destroy their achievements and it's as if they never existed. That's what Hitler wants and that's exactly what we are fighting for"" <br/><br/>The premise is great, the impact lackluster. Based on a true story, about the greatest treasure hunt in the history of mankind. We remember the Nazis for the holocaust and other war crimes, but something even more sinister was their attempt to steal, and later on as the Reich crumbles, try to destroy over 5 million pieces of art. A rag tag group of art historians and museum curators are asked to save over 1000 years of culture and heritage. Working in war-zones alongside combat units with imminent danger to their lives , this unlikely yet dedicated band of brothers chase down the thieves with an attitude bordering on flippancy. <br/><br/>Therein lies The Monuments Men's major weakness. For something based on WW2, the tone of the movie is too casual, and the humor is too liberally spread. Seasoned actors go about their jobs breezily wisecracking in every inch of the film. And there is an attempt at a love angle between Blanchett and Damon. Why not- she is playing a French after all, she has to flirt. But most of the characters remain unfleshed out, and as a result, the movie lacks emotion, even when key character deaths occur or even when the Monalisa is found. To its credit though, the film is technically brilliant.<br/><br/>Hitler had grand plans for the booty. He had planned a Fuhrermuseum that would stock all the art of the world. In case this scenario did not unfold, he had ordered the complete destruction of all that the Nazis had stolen. This was known as the Nero Decree. Being a lover of history and art, I cannot but be thankful to those who actually saved it all.

"ironhorse_iv","6","0","0","9 May 2014"," This movie had little monument worth. It was an alright art film. Bit mediocre.
","After reading the non-fiction book, The Monuments Men: Allied Heroes, Nazi Thieves and the Greatest Treasure Hunt in History, by Robert M. Edsel. I found the movie directed by George Clooney to be disappointing. It didn't help that it was loosely based off the book. The film follows an allied group known as the Monuments Men leaded by Frank Stokes (George Clooney) whom job is to find and save pieces of art and other culturally important items before their destruction by Hitler during World War II. I didn't hate the movie, but I didn't find it, the best. It was just a little boring. Honestly, nothing major happens in the film, until 40 minutes in. Barely any action in this film. The movie reminds me of a badly done Old School WWII film. The soundtrack by Alexandre Desplat sounds similar to 'The Great Escape', but it just doesn't have the same charm. All the great characters actors here, are so mellow down, here, as if not flesh out. If you're not going to put that much action in the film, at less, have some interesting comedy from interesting characters. After all, you have some of the great comedians there like Bill Murray & John Goodman. There were only a few scenes that gave me, small chuckles, but overall, not that funny. They also try to make it emotional. Like understanding how are we supposed to felt for Bill Murray's character, when we haven't been establish that he had kids in the opening. How are we supposed to feel emotional about their deaths if they die such a silly way. For being smart people who know about art. They do a lot of stupid mistakes, and end up, getting themselves killed. I know, they weren't made to be soldiers, but gees, they really look way out of place, here. There was a good scene where Frank Stokes interrogation a Nazi, but it's really doesn't help the plot, go along. They even try to make a love sub-plot between James Granger (Matt Damon) and Claire Simone (Cate Blanchet), they brutal it as well. You could had got a great story out of these two characters, but it's probably the worst part in the film. Its feel poorly structured. Honestly, this movie would had work better, if it was a min-series, because the various errands need more time to explore, so you can find it a bit more interesting. Although the film is based on real events, the names of all characters are changed, and a number of further adjustments to the historical facts were made in the interests of drama. Honestly, the source material of the book isn't that boring, there were a lot of stories to work out with. About historical accurate, it's a mixed, the movie state out the Monument Men was form after the bombing in Monte Cassino in 1944. In fact, its origins actually went back to British efforts in Libya in 1942, and it already existed when the Allies invaded Sicily in July 1943. The film's main characters of the unit number only eight. In reality, the program consisted of 400 men. Once again, they could add a lot more story to the film. Another thing is the misunderstanding of the Nero Decree. The Decree did not mention archives or art at all. In fact Hitler specifically ordered that all the art be left to German museums upon his death. It was mostly a 'scorched earth' campaign where destroying anything that might be useful to the enemy while advancing through or withdrawing from an area. Paintings are not really useful during a battle. Also, if your children happen to say 'Heil Hitler' doesn't always mean that they're Nazis. Every German was forced to say it at the time, despite what belief, they had. This film is a clear Hollywood History dramatization of the story and anyone who wants to see a film for an accurate account should see the 2006's Documentary, The Rape of Europa which tells the story better. Also check out, John Frankenhemer's 1969 film, 'The Train' that tells a similar plot. Overall: the film was alright, but don't be surprise if you find yourself snoozing or multi-tasking through bits of the film. It will do that, to you."

Either this is Romanian propaganda falsifying history and/or a gross failure of American movie makers to even check historical facts on a map.<br/><br/>If any historian would look at that map they can confirm that it is teaching the American public and the world false information about Eastern Europe, a part of the world they have so little correct information about anyhow."

","This is a great story. This is also a terrible screenplay. It runs like a filmed first draft. There's no sense of pacing, character and it's completely tone deaf. It's one disconnected scene after another. Some are comical in tone, others are somber, some are sentimental -- this one is a real head scratcher. It's a very well made film, with some great visuals and attention to period detail, but with such a discombobulated script it's a frustrating experience to sit through. Damon and Blanchett randomly meeting each other at an abandoned Jewish home, where he is returning a stolen painting is a contrivance the size of Europe. There are some deaths in the film that barely register as anything more than a reference by other characters - they are so sloppily done and dramatically inert. This film has the right cast, the right crew behind the camera, but this episodic script was not in any condition to be shot."

","I really looked forward to seeing this Film, and regret to say that it was a large disappointment. The story (purported to be true, but clearly over the top!) was poorly scripted, with far too much relying on clever quips, the actors tried to make this believable, but when saddled with some outrageous scenes like the one with the horse, reality went out the window. The best acting came from Cate Blanchett and Hugh Bonneville (so far from Downton Abbey), while Matt Damon<br/><br/>seemed to be missing in 75% of the story.

","First off, let's get something straight, the art in this film, isn't the real paintings/sculptures/etc. George Clooney is basically lying his @ss off the entire film. Not only are they taking replicas from the Nazis people are actually risking their lives to save the fakes. I mentioned this earlier on the Clooney forums I frequent and I was called a ""Nitwit"" and ""basement dwelling butt troll"" and they tried to enable this movie fakering by saying ""it's just a movie"" and ""of course they aren't real, do you think they're gonna let a bunch of actors use the real art in a movie with explosions and Matt Damon around?"" I mean come on guys, John Goodman is in this movie and he doesn't even eat corn. I'm pretty sure that's a staple for him, because he's always eating corn. I also didn't like how at the 1 hour 34 minute mark you clearly see Captain America in the background. I get that movie making is expensive and sometimes they have to reuse sets, but come on, they can at least film separate movies at different times.

","good intentions but falls flat in the end.<br/><br/>The film, directed by George Clooney, tells the true story of a group of men sent into war-zones during World War II to find, recover, and protect art. The story is quite interesting, and knowing its true makes it horrific. The topic was done carefully, and it has potential to be good. It's being called a tame ""Inglorious Basterds"", but maybe it's just too tame.<br/><br/>The cast have its positive and negative moments. Bill Murray gives the best performance, followed by John Goodman. Their emotional and comedic talents echo well through-out. The rest of the cast are hit or miss, with pleasurable performances by Hugh Bonneville and Jean Dujardin. George Clooney is not bad; just it lacks the power of a stand-out performance. His performances don't have the charisma, the staying power, or the connection of his characters in a Coen Brothers film.<br/><br/>Matt Damon and Cate Blanchett are key to the downfall of this film. It's understandable that the characters were to be included as it's a true story and these characters were heavily featured in the book. However, their characters relationship and duties were a quarter of the two hour film. If the characters were taken out of the film, it would have been enjoyably shorter and tell the exact same story. Their performances aren't bad, but their characters and the way they are written in gives them very little to work with.<br/><br/>Clooney's direction with the story is well. Outside of the Damon-Blanchett storyline, the film seems like it knows what it wants to do. Co-writers Clooney and Grant Heslov don't bring the strongest script to the battlefield, lacking the characterization and strength that The Men Who Stare at Goats had. The characters had no chemistry, outside of Lt. Donald Jeffries (played by Hugh Bonneville), who is given the least amount of screen-time. The script also attempted to capture a sense of nostalgia, which seemed to be very stiff, especially at the end of the film. Clooney and Heslov attempt to reproduce the ending moment of Saving Private Ryan, and while it is sweet, it's not a strong ending. It just feels like something that has been done before, but this time with characters that the audience doesn't have a connection to.<br/><br/>While the film is entertaining every now and then, with great performances by Murray and Goodman, the film finds itself stuck in a subplot that doesn't progress the story, a lack of character development, and a sense of nostalgia that is too tawdry."

In my lifetime, the giant Buddhas in Afghanistan--their Twin Towers--have been lost forever. There were the world's largest statues--standing for umpteen centuries--and they were used for Taliban artillery target practice. America twiddled its thumbs when this happened. Therefore, the Taliban were emboldened to have their Al Qaida henchmen destroy OUR Twin Towers (which were the world's tallest buildings when they were built). See a pattern here? The Great Pyramids, the Sphinx, and the Kremlin's St. Basil church are among the world's most endangered cultural treasures we still have left. We moved London Bridge to Arizona already; it's high time we bring the Pyramids and the rest of it over here for safe keeping, as well. American billionaires will chip in for transportation costs (and may be willing to throw in the cost of placing full-scale replicas at original sites, if the host governments prefer to have something for their angry mobs to vandalize and destroy).

","Written, directed and starring Hollywood darling, George Clooney; a cast to die for with five Oscars between them; a truth-is-stranger-than-fiction plot of audacious international thievery What could possibly go wrong with The Monuments Men? <br/><br/>How long do you have? <br/><br/>No, that's not fair. The Monuments Men isn't a stinker by any means. It is just a dull, confused, protracted almost film. It is almost exciting, almost clever, almost fun Based on the true story of a task force of just seven museum curators, directors and art historians, dubbed The Monuments Men, Clooney's fifth film in the director's chair stumbles through Hitler's mission to steal Europe's greatest artworks for his planned Führermuseum (Leader's Museum) and the Allied mission to steal them back and return them to their rightful homes. Battling squaddies and generals with no love for, or understanding of, art as well as the armies of the Third Reich, it was a dangerous and largely doomed mission to retrieve unimaginable art collections and prevent their certain destruction should Hitler fail to conquer the world.<br/><br/>The source material is fantastic. What a remarkable operation! The Monuments Men should be a war romp in the vein of Kelly's Heroes or Where Eagles Dare but Clooney seems unsure whether it should be a Boy's Own adventure, a comedy knockabout or a history lesson with sensitive and sincere bon mots to make the audience reflect admiringly. It fails on every count and winds up as a WWII Ocean's Seven with a severe identity crisis.<br/><br/>The stars that fill this two-hour somnambulistic mess coast along in the company of good friends, the knowledge of a good pay cheque and a free trip around Europe. It shows. There is no passion, urgency or fervor, just a clumsy jumble of ideas with no real conviction and little direction.<br/><br/>It is very hard to connect the director of The Monuments Men with the man who helmed Good Night, and Good Luck and The Ides of March. And while it should be fun watching Clooney, Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Hugh Bonneville, Jean Dujardin and Bob Balaban play at overweight, inept soldiers in the company of Cate Blanchett, it is just tedious.<br/><br/>The Monuments Men is filled with opportunities for excitement and adventure but instead of a film we can lose ourselves in and a motley crew of characters we can root for, we are left disappointed and with the feeling that Clooney really should have done better.<br/><br/>More upsettingly, a generation who have never heard of the real Monuments Men and the amazing mission they risked their lives for will brush it off as a bland fiction and forget it on the drive home.<br/><br/>What a waste of a fine opportunity, a great plot and an excellent cast."
"PassPopcorn","6","0","0","21 February 2014"," Pass the Popcorn! review
","George Clooney is usually considered a good actor and an even better director. Although he directed only a few movies, almost all of them were good, especially The Ides of March and Good Night and Good Luck. So it was natural to expect much from The Monuments Men, particularly since, even before its release (and its postponement), it was considered an Oscar contender. Add to all this the cast of good and talented actors, and the interesting true story (I'd never heard of the monuments men before), and you'll get something that's probably too good to be true. But The Monuments Men isn't good: it's a very confusing movie that is either extremely comedic or extremely dramatic, and it doesn't work.<br/><br/>The Monuments Men are a group of art historians and museum directors and curators, led by Frank Stokes (George Clooney), who are sent to Europe during World War II in order to try and prevent the Nazis from stealing and destroying art pieces, and to find the art that has been stolen so they can return it to the rightful owners. They start off as a group, but are then sent, as couples, each in a different town, throughout France and Germany. The story is simple, but it's very difficult to follow what's happening, since there are characters who look similar (Hugh Bonneville is like a combination of Bill Murray and John Goodman) and only Matt Damon and George Clooney's characters are properly introduced, from the beginning. All the others eventually gain some personality towards the end of the movie.<br/><br/>It could be said that there's no villain in this movie. Of course, the Nazis are the bad guys, but it's not easy to feel the tension of war and fighting if you don't have a physical character that represents the bad guys. There are some shots of Hitler and various generals/officers, but all of them are just generically sleazy and irritating, like there hasn't been put any effort in making them quality villains, because we already know Nazis were bad people. Another big problem with the movie is that, for a lot of its duration, it seems like a collection of loosely connected individual stories, and when one ends and the other one begins, the most common reaction is ""oh, I forgot this guy was in the movie"". And this happened every time they showed Matt Damon on screen. Logically, you can't connect with the characters and feel for them – even when somebody dies, you couldn't care less.<br/><br/>The soundtrack isn't objectively bad, but it's more suited for a Disney movie than The Monuments Men, and it makes even the most serious and dramatic moments look pathetic and silly. The things that redeem this movie are the good performances by the cast, some well-executed scenes and the story – because, as I've already said, I had never heard of the monuments men before, this movie taught me something. It's just sad that such an important and interesting part of history has been ignored until now, and has been ruined with this movie, that can't seem to decide whether it wants to be a comedy or a drama, so it goes from tragic scenes of death to scenes that look like spoofs. In short, you better skip this movie.<br/><br/>Rating: 6/10 Read more at passpopcorn.com"

","The Monuments Men depicts one of those parts of history that sounds like some sort of a mission impossible, it's about a group of volunteers who came out to find and protect European artifacts that were taken by the Nazis during World War II. It's not much of a popular story, but it's pretty interesting. The film follows some roots from the inspired team chemistry of Oceans Eleven to the wondrous tone of Indiana Jones. While those added flavors are charming and all, the risks of the mission is unfortunately not taken seriously, which leads to something less remarkable than it should have been. However, the great cast keeps it a lot entertaining even if there is still a better meat within this story.<br/><br/>Although it's a historical war movie, the film takes a lighter tone. There are still violence and terror happening on screen, but they are only taken as breezy bits of tension. It's disappointing because those are likely the only parts when the mission feels like it's going somewhere. Anything else are either speeches about how important the arts that they're supposed to save or a long conversation waiting to engage a random punchline. These things are not particularly bad, but the portrayal of whatever the actual people were going through still deserves a serious consideration. So now we're just watching a feel-good comedy taken place on a classical environment.<br/><br/>Everything looks magnificent at least. Clooney as a director seems to love bringing the seventies/eighties bright tone with marvelously rich production to give lots of life to the exteriors. It instantly makes everything looks like a good fun old fashioned adventure film. Even the music score also has a sense of nostalgia. But the real deal around is the cast. George Clooney and Matt Damon are obviously the stars here, while they did what they do best, it was the supporting who gave more color to this inert gloss. Cate Blanchett gives a charming personality to her character. The presence of Bill Murray could make anyone smile for, sometimes, no reason. And there is quite a joy to be found in the scenes of Bob Balaban and Jean Dujardin.<br/><br/>It's difficult to call The Monuments Men a bad film, it's also troubling to call it a good one either. There is an obvious heart to notice within the surfaces, the stars are awfully charismatic and they seem to be having fun doing their classic thing. I could say it's an absolutely charming film, but the story behind this seems to be more interesting than the merits. I guess this is only recommendable to the ones who seek for easy entertainment because the true tensions of World War II are hardly welcome here."

If you're into arts, you'll certainly be doing like me throughout the movie, it's like a treasure hunt: Rembrandt here, Van Dyke or Renoir there... That part is really fun. The acting is pretty good in general. The costumes and sets are looking good and realistic. The problem is: against such a backdrop as WWII, where so many people died and such atrocities happened, I couldn't help but wonder, like one character in the movie, if it was worth it to send men to die for pieces of art, be they signed by Rodin or Picasso. This defuses the drama of the movie, although there are a couple of good scenes that will stick to you more. But it's hard to really care in depth about pieces of canvas and marble when you know there were human beings suffering unspeakable things right at the same time. I *have* to set the record straight about Matt Damon's character's awful French speaking ""abilities""...! Somehow his horrendous pronunciation is excused by the fact that he supposedly learnt French in Montreal. Excuse me! I'm Québécoise myself and I could not understand one blessed word he was saying when speaking ""French"". All it was, was really, really bad pronunciation by and English speaking tongue that revolts itself against anything remotely french-sounding. And by the way, Cate Blanchett was not convincing either as a ""French"" woman.

They are met by people who don't want to help. those that do, and those that are skeptical. The group divides up as our plot divides into subplots.

In spite of the Indian Jones action music, I couldn't be moved as our crew discovered where art was hidden.<br/><br/>Yes, the evil Hitler was taking art out of the hands of private collectors and was going to place it in a public museum.

","""The Monuments Men"" is based on real events of a special unit during World War II, and the men who served in the Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives (MFAA) section. The characters are fictitious. But George Clooney and Grant Heslov did a fine job of making the characters composites from several of the real men who served in the MFAA. Two books by Robert M. Edsel served as the main source for the screenplay. The first was ""Rescuing Da Vinci: Hitler and the Nazis Stole Europe's Great Art – America and Her Allies Recovered It,"" in 2006. The second was a 2010 book, ""The Monuments Men: Allied Heroes, Nazi Thieves and the Greatest Treasure Hunt in History."" <br/><br/>All aspects of this movie are excellent. Some reviewers don't think the humor fits. Others think the movie is slow or boring. But for most movie buffs who have broad interests and curiosity, this film is a winner. The casting was very good, and I think the humor fits nicely. It compliments the seriousness and dangers of the mission, the obvious respect and love for art of the main characters, their willingness to risk their lives to save precious art works, and their awe at finding specific pieces and caches of great works. <br/><br/>For a non-combat unit, the MFAA team has a good amount of action, suspense and intrigue. The reproductions of art pieces are excellent. Surely, some shots must have been of the actual works. Two of the 345 men of the MFAA were killed during the war – an Englishman and a Frenchman. In the film, two such fictitious characters are killed. The first MFAA unit broke down into pairs to scout various suspected or reported art caches. The movie also shows this. All told, the MFAA sought out and searched more than 1,000 treasure trove sites that contained more than 5 million pieces of stolen art. <br/><br/>One of the MFAA characters in the movie comes close to a real WW II member. James Granger, played by Matt Damon, closely resembles Capt. James Rorimer, a curator of the NY Metropolitan Museum of Art. In the movie, he is recruited directly from his civilian position. In reality, Rorimer had signed up as an American infantryman in 1943, and was sought out and given a commission to be one of the original members of the MFAA. He met Rose Valland, whose character in the film resembles that of Claire Simone, played by Cate Blanchett. Rorimer later was promoted to chief of the MFAA section of the Seventh Army, and was in charge of seizing the art collections of both Herman Göring and Josef Goebbels. After the war, he returned to the Met where he later served as director for 11 years until his death in 1966. <br/><br/>On the official Web site of the Monuments Men (www.monumentsmen.com), I found several other members who identified in part with the characters in the film. One was Capt. Deane Keller, a 5th U.S. Army MFAA officer from 1944 to 1946 in Italy. He served for 40 years as a Yale art professor after the war. The bios of different members place them at some of the major treasure trove sites in the film. <br/><br/>The movie has a scene at Neuschwanstein Castle in Bavaria, where more than 6,000 works of art were recovered. Another is at Berchtesgaden, Germany – site of Hitler's ""Eagle's Nest."" The 101st Airborne Division first reached there and found more than 1,000 paintings and sculptures stolen by Göring. Other scenes are in salt mines and caves where huge caches of art works were hidden. Merkers, Germany, and Altaussee, Austria, were among these. The latter had 6,500 paintings alone. It also had the two major works from Belgium that were covered at length in the movie. Michelangelo's sculpture, the Madonna of Bruges was found there, as was Jan van Eyck's Ghent Altarpiece that was stolen from Saint Bavo Cathedral in Ghent. <br/><br/>From the time the MFAA was established in 1944 under the Civil Affairs and Military Government section of the U.S. Army, a total of 345 men served in the section. They came from 13 nations. The U.S. had 216, England had 58, France had 23, 20 were from Austria, and 11 were from The Netherlands. The rest were from other countries including Belgium, Poland, New Zealand, Spain and Russia. <br/><br/>Not all who served in the MFAA were curators, museum staffers, artists, teachers or architects – as are the characters in the film. Many were men who were just interested in the assignment, and who were transferred from other positions of active duty in Europe at the time. This was in the waning months of the war and the year after the war's end. But, the earliest members – those who did much of the searching and recovery efforts during hostilities, included some men who were recruited from civilian life and who had art and cultural backgrounds. <br/><br/>The MFAA was disbanded in 1946, but a small group of about 60 art detectives continued to search for stolen art works for another six years. For all the great works and many millions of individual art pieces recovered by the MFAA, a sizable number of great works remains missing. Most are assumed to have been destroyed by the Germans. The movie has a scene with Germans burning a huge cache of paintings, including Raphael's Portrait of a Young Man. It was stolen by the Nazis from Poland, and is considered by many to be the most valuable of all art works yet lost from the war. A report in 2012 that it had resurfaced was a hoax. <br/><br/>The MFAA wasn't just a sudden brainchild of someone during the war. Its roots go back to two lay organizations before the war. Anyone interested in more of the fascinating history of this program will find it on various sites on the Web."

","*********************DOES CONTAIN SPOILERS***************************** If you're expecting to read a professional review, you're in the wrong area. I saw this today and wanted to share my views.<br/><br/>I was invited to watch this film with some friends. I'd seen the trailer, and hadn't planned to see it, but with this all-star cast, I expected much more. <br/><br/>Maybe audiences have truly become too aware and film-makers just need to try much harder. For this film, it seems all the focus was on appearances, and less on structure. <br/><br/>I found myself wondering why some scenes were in the movie. The young German soldier smoking in the woods at night with Halaban and Murray. It was painful to watch, and I asked myself what possible relevance it could have. It was strained and boring, no drama at all. As good as the shower/record player scene was by Murray, I think Clooney could have used those 7 or 8 minutes on character development earlier on and they would have been better spent. The dialogue was bland and uninteresting. The villains were...well, villains, but they didn't ""scare"" me. For SS officers, they weren't diabolical enough, evil enough. For me, anyway. Some have described the interaction between Blanchett and Damon as a romance. When? Where? After studying WWI, ""Kultur"", and the systematic destruction of Belgium's and Northern France's Medieval churches and Cloth Halls by the Hohenzollern Prussian dynasty, I did relate to the premise of the movie, The Monument Men. Perhaps it was to avoid repeating the same cultural rape which occurred in Flanders, a mere 30 years before. It was a good idea, just kinda fell flat."

","The Monuments Men: 6 out of 10: George Clooney directs a breezy tale of the Allied troops that were in charge of making sure the Americans didn't destroy every single piece of art while taking back Europe single-handedly.<br/><br/>The Good: You know that Steven Spielberg ruined World War 2 films for an entire generation. Movies like The Monuments Men used to be much more common before Saving Private Ryan and Schindlers List. The British in particular were rather fond of them. Thankfully after twenty odd years this too severe by half World War 2 treatment finally seems to be passing, +and we can now get back to various genres feeling at home in World War 2.<br/><br/>The Monuments Men is a throwback to the old fashioned war film where a bunch of chaps pulls one over on the Nazies. There is a breezy, light humor to the whole affair with some sad moments sprinkled in.<br/><br/>The Monuments Men is also a very nice production with a top-notch cast. There is some seriously high-quality set dressing in this movie. It is one of the better-filmed representations of this time during the war in Europe.<br/><br/>
The Bad: I praise the acting, but I have to admit that John Goodman does not look good in this movie. He seems in ill health and out of place (He is acting among Bill Murray and Bob Balaban neither of whom are athletic specimens or spring chickens themselves.) His story is also the weakest of all the characters which bring us to a severe structural problem the film has.<br/><br/>For some reason, the eight or so Monument men split up early on, and all have their adventures either by themselves or in This makes it hard to get invested in the story as a whole as we are hopping fairly often between characters. This constant hopping around makes scenes often feel like interesting vignettes rather than part of the entire story. As a result, we often have severe tonal shifts as a sad, sentimental scene swishes over to a high farce or budding romance with barely a segue. A filmmaking technique I call meanwhile in Paris.<br/><br/>Another query why does Clooney insist on making his men such freaking boy scouts in this movie? Making Matt Damon's character an adulterer or maybe have one of the guys be racist would have gone a long way to shading these ciphers. As it is the cast lacks any real dimension outside of the most surface tropes.<br/><br/>Clooney is invested in the mission as told in his tale and lessons regarding the importance of art for civilization. He also fears that the movie-going audiences knowledge of Italian Renaissance painters is restricted to those that were Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. So there is a lot of talking down to the audience and explaining the main point of the film over and over again.<br/><br/>The Ugly: I have long given up on historical accuracy in movies, but here we go. The actual Monuments Men consisted of 345 men and women from 13 countries, not seven guys. Preparation started before the US even entered the war, and General Eisenhower was a major proponent. Cate Blanchett's character is Rose Valland the famous member of the French resistance who did thwart a lot of Nazi art stealing. If your curious what she did the 1964 John Frankenheimer wartime thriller The Train is based on one of her books.<br/><br/>And then there is the Nero Decree that the plot of the last part of the film depends. It is as if Clooney realized that the Nazis plan of taking the art, storing it safely, and then putting it in a museum lacked a particular menace. So we have Nazis burning art and a race to save it. Unfortunately for the movie, the Nero plan was about burning railroad terminals, not Monets and it was never implemented by Albert Speer anyway.<br/><br/>In Conclusion: Overall the film was a pleasant experience with beautiful sets and locations and good acting. Just not a lot of substance there and the film never feels confident in its audience to come to their own conclusions."
"tabuno","7","2","6","28 January 2019"," A competent but uneven movie
","Directed by George Clooney who also starred and included Matt Damon, John Goodman, and Cate Blanchett, this movie inspired by the World War II allied effort to save invaluable art treasures that the Nazi's had stolen, has trouble with its overall tone. It has very poignant moments especially over the dramatized risk of the soldiers took in saving their valued treasures as well as a sensitive subplot between one male soldier and a French woman. Unlike The Great Escape (1963), this World War II movie doesn't seem to find its balance between comedy and drama in either its direction and musical selection. A competent but uneven movie about an appealing and different perspective of the War."

","You know how people complain that they ""don't make nice, simple movies"" anymore? Check this one out. Confidently directed by Clooney, this gorgeous film follows a group of WWII soldiers with one very complicated task: rescue and recover as many great works of art as they can from the Nazis. Sounds like an easy job, right? Nope. With the Germans losing the war, they started retreating back into their native land--and took everything they had pillaged with them. Or burned it. Clooney, Damon and Blanchett are great -- I got a distinct ""wartime Ocean's 11"" vibe from them -- but the real standouts are Bill Murray and John Goodman, investing their characters with heart. It's not the greatest movie ever made, and not even the best WWII movie ever made (that's Schindler's List, a movie I saw once and never need to see again), but it's the kind of the un-ironic, un-cynical movie Hollywood doesn't make any more."

","When we saw a preview for this movie at the theatre back in the day, I showed some interest, maybe b/c Bill Murray is in the cast. My wife turned to me and said, ''you know it's going to be horrible, right?""
Turns out, she over-rated this movie by quite a large margin.
I can almost imagine Clooney calling up his buddies and asking, ''Who's up for a paid European vacation? We don't have a shooting script, so we'll just makeup as we go along. I read the book. It'll be fine. Trust me.""
It's earnest and dull on a level rarely seen these days. The way they're always staring at the paintings when they discover them. Check out Clooney when he finally comes across a key piece. Whoa. What's he doing with his hand there?
The narration somehow makes it even worse, driving it to a point of pathos that I haven't seen since the days of the NBC Very Special After School Special.
If you want to see the story of saving art from the Nasties, watch The Train. If you want to see American soldiers goofing around behind the lines while chasing valuables, watch Kelly's Heroes or Three Kings.
If you want to see fine art without being treated like an idiot by a Hollywood blowhard, visit The Louvre."

","Due to the initial success of the Nazi war effort in France, Poland and other European countries certain art enthusiasts get together and offer a plan to the President of the United States to build a small military unit to go to the front lines and recover all of the valuable paintings and sculptures they can before they are shipped off to Germany. Naturally, with the overall victory over Germany and Italy still in doubt there aren't many resources available to them and the task at hand is extremely dangerous as well. However, their efforts are rewarded to a certain degree when a man named ""Frank Stokes"" (George Clooney) is given the authority to assemble a squad to carry out the mission. To that effect, he gathers various art collectors and enthusiasts that he can trust and together they venture into France, Belgium and even Germany in order to acquire the treasures before the Germans can hide or destroy them. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an interesting film in large part because it was based on a true story. Having said that, however, I must admit that there were some scenes that seemed a bit contrived and unrealistic. Be that as it may, that's not to say that I necessarily disliked this film and all things considered I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average."

","The Monuments Men is based on the true story of a great treasure hunt. An unlikely crew of art historians tasked by FDR with going into Germany on a mission to recover artistic masterpieces from Nazi thieves. These men and women were trying to preserve what our civilization is all about and what it means to be human in the midst of horrible atrocities. Appears there was little knowledge of this dedicated group of men and this film is an educational,learning experience that memorializes people who were trying to preserve our culture but more importantly to prevent Hitler from gloating over his evil accomplishments and conquered countries that would only contribute to the inevitable survival of the Nazis.<br/><br/>The male actors George Clooney, Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Jean Dujardin and Hugh Bonneville did a fine job. Cate Blanchett was a curator at the Lourve,she was equally as impressive. Matt Damon befriended her and she provided them with a general idea of where to look including special identifying markings. They found themselves in a race against time to avoid the destruction of 1000 years of culture,risking their lives to protect and defend mankind's greatest achievements.<br/><br/>In one particular scene they find a cave not only brimming with treasures but chilling reminders of the millions of persecuted Jews Hitler had murdered. Their gold teeth, rings and shoes packed in barrels or thrown on the ground. This discovery created a dead silence amongst the men.<br/><br/>It makes no sense that this movie was criticized so much. What was really expected from this film? Surely not an action flick, thriller or war movie. Just not enough bloody violence,which seems to be a draw these days.Did Hollywood alter the exact truth,what else is new? An important story that needed to be told about a group of men who risked their lives and deserve our respect.<br/><br/>Note: Research states that Millions of art was recovered but much is still outstanding."
"anaconda-40658","7","1","2","5 May 2015"," A Real Monument.
","The Monuments Men (2014): Dir: George Clooney / Cast: George Clooney, Matt Damon, Jean Dujardin, Cate Blanchett, Bill Murray: The message regards the restoration of art both in its retrieval from Nazi Germany and within the memories of those who created it. The ensemble cast is led by George Clooney and he is joined by several others referring to themselves as the Monument Men. They travel to Paris and throughout Germany to track down various art and many wonder whether the risk is worth it. Interesting concept but extremely repetitious and not as action oriented as it may first appear. George Clooney previously directed such gems as The Ides of March and Confessions of a Dangerous Mind. This is not on par with those films but its humour and historical themes add interest. The first issue is that the ensemble consists mainly as types as oppose to personalities. While Clooney is successful behind the camera, in front his leading role is bland and uninteresting. Matt Damon has his moments as a recruit whose French is called into question more than once. Cate Blanchett also has moments as a contact whose brother was murdered attempting to move and hide art. Damon is sent to gain her assistance as to where other hidden art lie. The rest is a great cast but characters that are less interesting than the art they are attempting to find. Even Bill Murray and Bob Balaban attempt a comic double act that doesn't quite pay off. It presents a worthy theme in terms of art and culture and the legacy it leaves behind but for Clooney it doesn't monument as one of his best. Score: 7 / 10"
"filmfanperspective","4","1","2","5 May 2015"," Unfocused and ultimately droll, and Clooney knew it (**)
","One of the more memorable scenes in film is the last moment from ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", where the camera slowly pans up to reveal an entire warehouse of artifacts. Granted, this was a place of 'secret things', not necessarily artwork. However, that film did cover the fact that the World War II-era Nazis hoarded thousands of cultural artifacts from across the Eastern Hemisphere. They wanted it all for themselves- for if you rob a people of its' culture, you rob them of their spirit, as the theory was. These are big ideas, ripe for extrapolation on-screen, either as a dead-serious drama, or as quasi-adventure film, a la Indiana Jones. ""The Monuments Men"", however, never settles for one idea, and thus doesn't have an identity. The result is a muddled, aimless enterprise of a film that combines a fantastic cast, then doesn't do much with them.<br/><br/>I'll declare myself a big fan of George Clooney, but his directorial efforts have brought about decidedly mixed results despite stellar casts before. ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" is a very good film with a specific focus. ""The Ides of March"" seemed to exist simply to tell us what we already knew- politics are corrupt. The Chuck Barris biopic ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"" was also an unspectacular, yet star-studded shoulder-shrugger of a film. In other words, it's hard to really get a grasp on how creatively talented Clooney is behind the camera. The only common thread I gather is that his films start with an inspired idea, and he simply presents it to us on-screen. Some just keep our attention longer than others.<br/><br/>""The Monuments Men"" cannot keep its' own attention for long, not even to enrich the main characters (real people, for which real facts exist to extrapolate on). The film wastes no time in gathering this apparently motley crew, in a sequence so rushed it reeks of a montage. We do know this to be true, however; there were, in fact, a group of middle-aged men that joined the Army in World War II in hopes of recovering stolen art. They were, as the film shows us, an unlikely group. They were indeed brave by definition for heading into war zones. They did, in fact, recover thousands upon thousands of pieces of art across Europe.<br/><br/>What else were they, however? Other than brief, obligatory mention of families back home, the film doesn't provide much nuance or inspiration to any of these characters. That's a crying shame when you consider the massive talents in the cast. Clooney? The affable 'really cool guy'. Damon? Eminently likable. Murray? Capable of showcasing a broad range of abilities. Goodman? Everyone's favorite 'dad' figure. Dujardin? Limited exposure to American audiences, but already an Oscar winner. The film asks us to care deeply about these men and what happens to them, but it clearly overestimates our zest for the actors themselves. So little time is spent with them as a group and exploring what made them tick, and it just doesn't work. On top of that, what exactly did this magnificent conglomeration of actors bring to their roles? For all the fanfare about their grouping, it doesn't seem to have brought the best work out of any of them.<br/><br/>An exception to that would be (big surprise) Cate Blanchett as a French woman forced to catalog the art Nazis were stealing from her own community. Not only is she important to the mission (and the film's resolution), but her character's longing to feel anything other than hatred for Nazi action lends this film a steely emotional grab it so desperately needed. I envisioned there could have been a different film centered around this Claire Simone- a woman forced to betray her beliefs, then forced to watch, then forced to catalogue all of her culture's artistic heritage, then forced to smile about it.<br/><br/>As straightforward as it is, the story of ""The Monuments Men"" may have worked better in documentary form. That would've afforded whatever filmmaker took on the project a chance to show the individuals involved with the 'Monuments Men' mission- without associating our notions of these actors with them. There are multiple ideas with which to work in this film, but no strong, emotional connection is created with any of them. We're not sure whether Clooney wants us to laugh at the myriad of personalities thrown together for a decidedly non-traditional mission, or be moved by the wretchedness of war and Nazi malfeasance. Even the most poignant moment in the film, taking place in an Allied camp at Christmas time, seems out-of-place and awkward in its' silence. I wasn't sure whether I should be laughing or crying. It's precisely the type of confused reaction you might expect when you watch a film that has no idea what it wants to be."

","George Clooney the director displays one of the finest traits of George Clooney the actor: generosity of spirit. Just as he works well in an ensemble setting, not needing to dominate the screen, he also doesn't need to dominate the screen with look-at-me directing. No clichéd shaky cam, no clichéd fast cuts ad nauseum, no clichéd telling the audience where to look (how many thousands of times has a director zoomed in on someone's hands as they spoke? 20 thousand? 50 thousand? More?)<br/><br/>Instead Clooney trusts the story, the characters and the emotions to be the focus. He makes sure that each of the fine actors/characters in the ensemble has their own moments. He doesn't feel the need to fill up the screen with explosions and chaotic action. This ultimately makes the few scenes of warfare much more compelling. Rather than one more firefight we get two characters in a pastoral setting suddenly caught in the instant before a battle erupts. This makes the tragic death of one of them more humanly compelling. It also gives a stark human face to the bonds between comrades in wartime. (Bravo, John Goodman for a beautifully understated but gut wrenching display of grief.<br/><br/>This is ultimately an uplifting film that shows us the best of humanity in the worst of times. It rewards patience and deeper thought."

","The Monuments Men is a very interesting movie based off a little-known section of the U.S Army during the Second World War and that is the Monuments Men who were charged with saving valuable pieces of artwork in war-torn Europe. The movie itself wasn't bad, but it had much higher potential. The story and the cast are excellent, but the way the story presented itself was an issue. The screenplay tries to inject comedy into the film, but the this film would have worked better as a serious drama. That being said, I did enjoy the film and it was a highly- involving film based on an important historical study. <br/><br/>George Clooney's film is about how a man named Frank Stokes is charged with putting together a team of officers to go to Europe and track down stolen art from the Nazis and return them to their rightful owners. <br/><br/>The film has a very stacked cast and each one of their moment to shine. George Clooney of course is great as Frank Stokes, and the same can be said about Matt Damon as Clooney's right-hand man, James Granger. Bill Murray and John Goodman add a little humor to the film. I also liked the casting of Bob Balaban and Cate Blanchett, although I could have used some more scenes involving Cate. <br/><br/>Overall, The Monuments Men is the not the greatest war film ever made but it's an important film telling a story about the men who risked their lives to preserve our culture and our history and in that regard, they did a very good job in doing so. The movie works, but its main issue is the loosely-structured screenplay as the film is all over the place. But the acting and production values are top-notch. I rate this film 8/10."

But I like Clooney, I like his injecting appropriate comedic moments into an otherwise serious film. I never found it boring, to me it is paced just about right and the situations are never dull.<br/><br/>This is based on a primarily true story, of the US POTUS commissioning a small band of men in the 1940s, nearing the eventual end of WW 2 and the defeat of the Nazi Germans. The Nazis had systematically stolen great works of art, millions of different items, and had carted them away to be hidden for their own selfish purposes. The men commissioned all had an appreciation for art and looked it as a worthwhile mission, albeit very dangerous. In fact not all of them survived.<br/><br/>The big mystery was to figure out where in fact the ""monuments"" were being hidden, because captured Nazis were not cooperating. But one of them finally cracked the ""code"" on a map, all the locations had nearby mines, copper mines, salt mines, etc. They rightly figured the works of art were hidden in the mines.<br/><br/>George Clooney co-wrote and directed, and stars as the leader of the commission, Frank Stokes.

The story is about the Monuments Men,an Allied group of soldiers that is assigned of finding and gathering the pieces of art and other culturally important items that were stolen by the Nazis.They are running against time as Adolph Hitler intends its destruction during World War II.It was produced,written and directed by Clooney.<br/><br/>The Monuments Men is unlikely Allied group platoon.They were tasked by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to rescue missing art masterpieces from Nazi thieves at Germany to be able to return them to their rightful owners.It was deemed to be an impossible mission as they are trapped behind enemy lines and were ordered to be destroyed by Hitler.Added to that,the men are only made up of seven museum directors, curators, and art historians.Will they succeed in doing it at the end?<br/><br/>The movie has an interesting premise as we get to see another Allied group with an unlikely mission.Also,we have a talented cast starring in it.Unfortunately,the screenplay needs a lot of improvement as it was both sluggish and uneven.The viewer would find it confusing too on what its tone whether it is a drama,comedy,action,a war film or a character- driven film as well as it became somewhat more about the men in the group rather than their mission.With this tonal confusion,one may find it boring too as there seems to be a lack of urgency among the group to recover the missing art masterpieces as soon as possible. The only thing that I like is the commitment of the characters and the theme of the movie of providing importance to the arts the defined man's thousand of years of of culture and the preservation of their greatest achievements.Finally,it also provided the viewer some lessons in art history. It was just too bad that the movie cold have been better if the screenplay was written better."
"Geeky Randy","7","1","2","26 May 2014"," Geeky Randy's summary
","Underrated war film directed, co-written, co-produced and starring George Clooney as Lt. Frank Stokes (loosely based on George L. Stout) who recruits six men to help him track down great works of art that Hitler has been stealing for a personal museum. With John Goodman and Bill Murray in tow, the movie easily hits most of its laughs with excellent timing, while at the same time also delivering sincerity in its message. Unfortunately, the moral of the story might be overlooked by the masses; you probably need to have a great appreciation for art or be an artist yourself to fully appreciate this movie. However, the film's greatest downfall is that the comedic moments do not segue well into dramatic moments, and vice versa. Clooney requested to have the release of this film pushed a couple of months, causing it to miss out on deserved Oscar buzz.

","As a WWII history buff I have seen a heck of a lot of movies of that genre. But this is an intriguing story that to my knowledge has never been told on the big screen.

The horrible reviews kept me from seeing it in the theater, but I think a number of the critics didn't ""get"" what the movie was about. Yes, it's a retro vehicle, but it had a number of clever lines and genuinely tense moments. War is like that — there's humor right alongside death and tragedy.

"bob-rutzel-1","7","1","2","21 May 2014"," Good and Important Story
","This is based upon a true story<br/><br/>In 1943 President Roosevelt ordered a team of curators, and historians to join the US Army and they became known as The Monuments Men. Their task was to find and secure art treasures in Germany and countries under German control and return them to the rightful owners. The Nazis accumulated all this treasure to fill the Hilter Museum in Hitler's hometown in Austria. Hitler used mine shafts, coffins, German officer estates and various castles to hide the treasures until his museum was ready. However, when the war was deemed lost Hitler decried that all art treasures should go to German museums. There is another theory on this: Hitler wanted all the treasures destroyed. And, we do see some of that in here. <br/><br/>This movie seems like it's made up for entertainment purposes, but this was a real happening. This also seems somewhat disjointed but keep in mind that Frank Stokes (George Clooney) sent out several teams to distant places to look for the treasures. By doing this we don't really get to see the real nitty-gritty of the findings in any great detail because time is of the essence. So we see bits and pieces. The main item looked for was the Madonna and Child by Michelangelo, and Jan Van Eck's Ghent Alterpiece. But, the bouncing around from team to team didn't help keep us attentive except for some humor between Bill Murray as Richard Campbell and Bob Balaban as Preston Savitz. And, then we also see another comedy team of John Goodman as Walter Garfield and Jean Dujardin as Jean Claude Clermont. The humor with both of these teams was on the down-lo. And, rightly so. <br/><br/>The only story of note is James Granger's (Matt Damon) interaction with Claire Simone (Kate Blanchett) a French woman who collaborated with the Nazis. She knew where Hilter sent all the treasures and kept records of the rightful owners, We hang with Granger as he tries to convince Claire that the US government will return the treasures to the rightful owners. She doesn't believe him and is a tough room to put it mildly. <br/><br/>We don't see much of George Clooney in here as he also directed this movie. And, because we see George Clooney's name in lights and we run to the show. George Clooney should talk to Clint Eastwood about acting and directing in the same movie. This really needed a command post that juggled all the goings-on with the teams. Didn't happen. Yes, communication wasn't as it is today. Still<br/><br/>The only real drama occurs when the war is over and the Russians are seen advancing to the last place the Monuments Men are finishing up. And, here we are fighting the clock as the very last item isn't in the truck and the Russians are closing in. If the Russians get there in time, they get to keep the treasures. Those were the rules. Such excitement! I could hardly contain myself. Long story short: the Americans did leave behind something of note for the Russians. Can you guess what is was?<br/><br/>Now, we don't know if the names that made up The Monuments Men that we see in here were real or not as there was no acknowledgment of them at the end of the movie. Or maybe that was an oversight. When the credits run, we do see black and white photos of some original Monuments Men and the treasures they secured. Neat. <br/><br/>There is no mention of any monument to these men, who by the way, numbered close to 400. By my reasoning, there should be something set up in Washington, D.C. This is an important story that tells of these brave Monuments Men who were heroes and saved thousands of works of art and they should be recognized as such. To be honest, I never knew this happened and was glad it did and the story is finally told even if somewhat dis-jointed. Everyone should be aware of the Monuments Men and what they did for the world. <br/><br/>If you are interested in more information go to Wikipedia. (7/10)<br/><br/>Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No."

There is no drama, no sense of real danger or conflict, no concerns, no mood.<br/><br/>The scene with George Clooney and Matt Damon in the camp hospital is cringe worthy, an the two songs linked to this scene were an ordeal to endure.<br/><br/>All the 'motivational' speeches sound corny as hell too. Not to mention all the embarrassing moments such as when George says on the radio ""all hell is breaking loose here"" but nothing we see on screen support this line.<br/><br/>The sets looked out of a theme park, sterile.<br/><br/>And all the famous actors, although box-office baits, actually end up hurting the picture artistically. ""Look, it's John Goodman!"". ""Look, it's ""Bill Murray!"". Look it's .....(enter famous actor name here)!"" and so on.<br/><br/>The only suspenseful moment in the entire movie has to do with the eminent arrival of the Russians, but it's too brief to save this well intentioned mess.<br/><br/>And what's with all the smoking, cigarette fixation?"

The attitude towards smoking may have changed as one state: ""This movie is one unappreciated prolonged cigarette commercial"". But for me and probably most this movie is all about our perpetual admiration for art in general and for the recovered artifacts in particular. I have seen some of them and just took it for granted that they were there on display but I did not know this moving story behind it. Reading some of the negative reviews I am just stupefied by lack of appreciation for this great homage to an intrepid few and probably these critics never visit a museum either.

I couldn't really pin-down a failure anywhere. Let me explain why.<br/><br/>Like other successful war movies The Monuments Men does a good job of painting war-torn Europe as a cold and dreary place where people are trying to hang on to any tiny thread of sanity and normalcy they can grasp before it all goes to hell. It makes you think about war and why mankind does what it does.<br/><br/>The thing that struck me the most about this movie was the polarizing nature of War vs. Culture. The subtlety behind the screenplay is rather unique, imo.<br/><br/>This war in particular was about many things. Hitler not only attempted to annihilate a people... but he also attempted to steal every shred of precious art he could get his hands on. The MM were tasked with stopping that. How could anyone who read a synopsis or watched a trailer for this movie think it was supposed to be anything different?<br/><br/>I'm a better person for having watched this movie. I never knew about these guys and that was the point. I hope Clooney continues to make screenplays and movies that revolve around such selfless people as the MM... and never stops trying to inspire us with stories of such import.<br/><br/>This isn't Saving Private Ryan... or Band of Brothers... it's not about Soldiers. It's about a group of ordinary art lovers who task themselves with rescuing history and in doing so BECOME soldiers.<br/><br/>I loved this movie.

"Hitchcoc","7","1","2","18 March 2014"," A Hollywood Retelling
","I think people need to relax a bit and take a deep breath. This movie is pure Hollywood. It took an event near the end of World War II and put their own spin on it. To say it's the worst war movie ever made is really cynical and mean spirited. Granted, the characters are pretty stiff and not very well developed. They reminded me of those 1940's caricatures from propaganda driven films. Still, the event it is based on is a unique one in the annals of war history. Actually, in a convoluted way, the Nazi's interest in art probably was indirectly responsible for saving it. It prevented them from launching full-blown artillery attacks on some of the world's great museums. Instead, they stole these masterpieces (another means of repressing humanity) and stored them in salt mines and other secret places. The effort to discover and recover these masterpieces is what this is all about. Of course, in reality, this was done by about 150 people, not the seven presented here. Unexplained to the audience is how after a discovery a battalion of military vehicles seems to show up immediately to secure the art. There is also the sacrifice that is pretty contrived and gratuitous. This is a sort of old-fashioned movie done in contemporary times. Go along for the ride and don't imagine you are seeing Shakespeare."
"valadas","7","1","2","11 March 2014"," Terrific team
","Not exactly a masterpiece but a movie worth to be seen anyway. It's the story of a team charged to rescue works of art namely masterpieces stolen by the Nazis from museums, churches and private owners (mainly Jews) at the end of World War II when their defeated army was retiring from occupied countries (France and Belgium) chased by the Allies. The story is told in a pleasant visual terms and with an excellent performing of all actors in a good vivid rhythm and in a very well rebuild sceneries and atmosphere of locals and action of that time. The rescue team acts very courageously and with great comradeship among them. The story is totally credible despite several odd and dangerous situations in which the rescue team gets involved also because sometimes they lack support from the American army for their actions. It's lively and active and it's said that it's based on true real events. The vexed question it poses is that if the rescue of an art masterpiece is worth the loss of a human life since the rescuers incur in real life dangers."
"Turfseer","4","1","2","2 March 2014"," Clooney's episodic tale of WW II team of stolen art finders, fails to work dramatically
","'Monuments Men' is based on the true life team assembled during World War II, of museum directors, curators and art historians, assigned to save pieces of art before they were destroyed by the Nazis. According to the article, 'How Accurate is Monuments Men?', featured in Slate Magazine online, the original task of what was to become MFAA (Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives), was to protect historical buildings and not recover works of art. The film is only very loosely based on the true historical events so the question arises, has Mr. George Clooney successfully adapted the story to the silver screen, so that it works dramatically? The answer, unfortunately, is no.<br/><br/>'Monuments Men' would have worked much better as a documentary but Clooney was determined to turn this into a rip-roaring action-adventure flick with a few comic interludes. The problem of course is that there is no central antagonist throughout the film. The nature of the mission was that it occurred in different locales and at different times, hence the narrative had to be episodic in nature. So we're introduced to one villain after another--and once each one is disposed of, we move on to the next.<br/><br/>'Monuments Men' begins with Frank Stokes (Clooney) assembling his crackerjack team of art experts who must undergo basic training, before they're thrust into combat. It's sort of like 'The Dirty Dozen' with the characters being much more low-key and with little panache. Matt Damon as James Granger is assigned to learn as much as he can from Paris curator Claire Simone (a convincing Cate Blanchett), who kept a journal of all the art work stolen by Viktor Stahl, a Nazi official, who she was forced to work with prior to the German retreat (there is an unlikely scene where Stahl fires his pistol at Claire, as she watches trains loaded with the stolen art work, leave for Germany, from the Paris train station). <br/><br/>Later, team members Richard Campbell (Bill Murray) and Preston Savitz (Bob Balaban), track Stahl down who is disguised as a farmer. Murray and Balaban manage to mine a few laughs as the hapless Stahl is unable to explain away how Rothschild property markings appear on the back of all the paintings he has on the walls of the villa he's staying at. Stahl is then promptly taken into custody.<br/><br/>The film also covers the deaths of two team members who are killed in combat. One of the British members, Donald Jeffries, is killed at a Belgian church, as he attempts to prevent one of the Nazis from stealing the famed Michelangelo statute 'Madonna and Child' (the recovery of that particular piece along with the Van Eyck altarpiece, is the central focus of the film's narrative). A French member, Jean Claude Clermont, is also killed when he's caught in the crossfire of a battle (Clermont is an entirely fictional character as there were no French military personnel assigned to the Monuments Men team).<br/><br/>We shift back again to James Granger who still must convince Simone to provide information on the stolen artwork (she's miffed as she's now being held as a 'collaborator', despite her clear anti-Nazi sentiments). Granger shows her a copy of Hitler's 'Nero Decree' in which he ordered that ""all military, transportation, communications, industrial, and food supply facilities"" be destroyed. Historically, there was nothing about artwork being destroyed in the decree, but obviously, for dramatic purposes, Mr. Clooney added that in. This convinces Simone to finally help Granger and she provides him with her journal that contains all the names and original property owners of artwork stolen by the Nazis. <br/><br/>By including artwork in the 'Nero Decree', (as mentioned in Slate Magazine), Historian Elizabeth Campbell Karlsgodt points out that this was inserted in order to move the plot forward; the Monuments men are seen ""racing against the Germans who are set now to destroy the art if Hitler can't have it."" Karlsgodt doesn't even believe that the Monuments Men even knew about the Nero Decree during their mission: ""The systematic destruction (as seen in the film) being carried out as a result of the Nero Decree never happened,"" she says. ""Nazis destroyed art that they considered degenerate, like Cubist, Surrealist, Expressionist paintings, and we know that they burned several thousand— at least—paintings that they thought were actually toxic to the German spirit (But) they didn't destroy the art they valued."" (This included Germanic art, and the Ghent Altarpiece depicted in the film, which Hitler considered to be an example of ""Aryan genius."") <br/><br/>The rest of 'Monuments Men' feels rushed. The team uncovers the 'mother lode' of stolen artwork in a salt mine as well as gold from teeth extracted from Jews sent to the concentration camps. Later they find another mine where the Michelangelo's 'Madonna' is located. The drama is manufactured when they're forced to remove the stolen artwork (including the Madonna) just before the Soviets arrive in the occupation zone designated for them. In reality, the Monuments Men had plenty of time to remove the artwork from the cave—a matter of days and not hours, as depicted in the film.<br/><br/>Clooney gets his last licks in as he interrogates the Nazi colonel responsible for stealing and destroying a good deal of the pilfered artwork. In the case of both Nazis and Monuments Men alike, they're only on for a short time and there's no opportunity for the film's scenarists to develop any of the characters. <br/><br/>Karlsgodt feels that the film's focus on Michelangelo's 'Madonna' and the Ghent Altarpiece undermines the true significance of Hitler's plans and their connection to the Holocaust. Quoted in Slate Magazine, she remarks, ""It leaves out a really crucial aspect of this history. Hitler saw it as a key way to seize the assets of Jews. He was not only eliminating Jewish influence, he was also getting their art."""

","I usually fall asleep when I go and see movies at late show times, but I think the quality of this movie contributed to my falling asleep. A t the beginning the movie seems to promise a lot, the cast is great and you probably expects a lot from such great actors, but the movie never takes off, for different reasons. First, the contrast between the bleak theme and the comic treatment of the theme itself leaves somehow perplexed, as a result of this, every time there is a dramatic potential, it is banally resolved with some comic expedient, which is something which may works once, twice but not for the entire length of the movie. Moreover, the scenes do not seem to work together and in the end I got the impression of a chaotic scene sequence, moreover not supported by a strong script, so that the movie loses pungency in progress.

","The Monuments Men fictionalizes the true life adventures of a team of artists, art historians and curators who are drafted and ""tasked"" (not my term but screenwriter/director/star George Clooney's)to find and recover thousands of art treasures looted by the Nazis. War,larceny and an opportunity to right wrong on a scale unprecedented in history should provide for a spell binding viewing experience. Then why was I not spellbound? <br/><br/>Casting is always a delicate proposition. With the quizzical casting of George Clooney, Matt Damon, Cate Blanchett, Bill Murray and John Goodman in the major roles, one is left wondering how this will work. It doesn't. George Clooney, the group's leader and film director, is obviously too busy behind the camera to exhibit much on screen leadership and is therefore relegated to phoning in (literally) his role. Matt Damon, known for his powerhouse parts and some pretty good acting skills, is cast against type. That's okay, if given something to work with, which he isn't. Well Bill Murray is always good for a laugh. Oh right, this isn't a comedy. No matter, lets write some scenes specifically for him. Painful. And poor John Goodman is left lumbering his way through a nondescript part.<br/><br/>Cate Blanchett's role is by far the one with the most potential. But this is Monuments Men, not Monuments Women. Based on the true life character of Rose Valland, Gallerie Jue De Paume caretaker during the Nazi occupation, the character of Claire Simone (Ms. Valland) is written as a mean spirited, untrusting spinster who comes on to Matt Damon's character out of nowhere. But Damon's character is too vanilla to have any of that. Thankfully, Mr. Clooney does include some of Ms. Valland's indispensable part in recovering the Nazi loot.<br/><br/>It is understood these men are scholars, artisans, art businessmen and as such, are not the stuff of action heroes. But at least give them some dialog of weight. We never get the sense that these men are subject matter experts but some guys with a passing knowledge of great art.<br/><br/>In the end, treat an important historical event importantly, even if it is fictionalized. In the 1964 fictional epic ""The Train"" the French Underground attempts to stop a Nazi train filled with Impressionist Art stolen from the Jue de Paume. Actors of weight are cast - Burt Lancaster and Paul Scofield. John Frankenheimer and Arthur Penn direct. Taut screen writing prevails with dialog that conveys the importance of the character's endeavors (""Save the heritage of France""). There's little to none of that in The Monuments Men.<br/><br/>Apparently, they don't make 'em like that anymore."

Although, it has a very stereotypical portrayal of the WW II, it does not get boring at any point. If you're looking for a war movie with a lot of guns and shooting involved, I'd recommend Lone Survivor(if you haven't watched it yet) over this, but if you're looking for a decent historical film, this is good enough. Also, it's a catch for people looking for a quick, nice entertainer for the weekend.

The writing went wrong. <br/><br/>The film does a good job of showing that no matter how great other aspects may be, without good writing you have nothing. With perhaps the exception of Clooney's character, there is little development for many of the other characters. This becomes apparent when certain scenes arise requiring an emotional response, but since we're yet to really get to know them, we feel nothing. <br/><br/>If you are wanting to see this film based upon being a fan of one of the featured actors, then you will be disappointed. Bill Murray and John Goodman in particular seem very underused and an overall missed opportunity. There is also very little humour, considering its concept and cast (I understand it's set in Nazi Germany, but that's no excuse).<br/><br/>Save the cost of an expensive theater ticket and wait for the rental."
"jackiecouchman","8","1","2","16 February 2014"," An inspiring true story, but a bit lacklustre in the telling
","I always like to see movies based on facts, but this film didn't grip me in the way I thought it would. I found it jumped from location to location and time to time in a confusing way, not helped by lots of khaki (not a feast for the eyes). The characters weren't as engaging as they might have been, but maybe I dozed off when they were being built. I found it rather a sad, dreary, film. The art, central to the whole film, seemed on the periphery. Instead of feeling passionately about the treasures lost (and recovered) and completely championing the project, I found myself wondering if this would ever have commanded the budget in today's military. I enjoyed it, but would not buy the DVD."
"richard-1787","5","1","2","15 February 2014"," Not a great movie, but still worth seeing for the story - because the book on which it is based does not tell one story
","This movie got a poor review in the Cleveland paper from a reviewer I trust. Still, the subject interested me, and I've seen George Clooney directed movies that I loved, like ""Good Night and Good Luck,"" so I went anyway.<br/><br/>This is not another ""Good Night and Good Luck. The cast is impressive, but the script doesn't build any tension until near the end, by which time it is too late.<br/><br/>Comparison to John Frankenheimer's ""The Train"" is inevitable, and not flattering. In that movie, the defense of art is given to the curator of the Jeu de paume museum - Cate Blanchett's character here - and not to an American. Indeed, the American in Frankenheimer's movie, Burt Lancaster's character, can't buy her argument. The French curator argues that the art must be saved because it is part of French national culture, because it expresses what the French have been. (The script of *The Train* was adapted from *The Art Front*, the memoires of Rose Valland, the woman who had worked in the Jeu de pomme museum during the Occupation.) Here it is an American who argues the importance of art in general, and that it very different.<br/><br/>His argument is much more universal, which is to say that art is where man has been in the past. That's true, of course, but much less gut-wrenching, less immediate, less concrete. The French curator in ""The Train"" explains how so much else has been taken away from the French during the Occupation; they cannot allow their art, who they have been and therefore part of who they are now, to be taken away as well. The threat presented through George Clooney's character to FDR is less immediate. If the Germans take this art, nothing will happen to Americans and their culture in particular. It very much speaks to the different role art plays in American culture, as opposed to some European and Asian cultures.<br/><br/>This difference is brought out by the art that gets named in each movie. In ""The Train,"" the curator of the Jeu de paume lists the French painters whose works the Germans are about to remove from Paris. In ""Monuments Men,"" the work that gets the greatest attention is a Michelangelo statue, a work of Italian art, that is in a Belgian church, i.e., not a work of art that grew out of and expressed Belgian culture. That lack of understanding of the importance of national art to certain European cultures is a definite weakness in this movie. We only get the American perspective.<br/><br/>You see that at the very end. When the mission is over, FDR asks the leader, Clooney's character: ""In the future, will anyone care that you risked and gave your lives to save this art?"" After that question, we suddenly jump to the future and see Clooney's American art historian character, now elderly, pay a visit to the Michelangelo Madonna that he and his men saved during the war. It's all well and good that the statue should be appreciated by a Harvard art historian. But it would have been much more moving if we had seen locals moved by the sacrifice of these Americans to preserve a part of their art/culture, say the altarpiece that was also saved and that is presented as the essence of Medieval European culture. (Though it is really, at most, an expression of Northern European Medieval culture.)<br/><br/>The end of Frankenheimer's movie also asks the question ""Is art worth losing men's lives to save it?"", but without providing a clear answer. The last shots, of dead Frenchmen on the ground and then the crates of art the Nazis tried to take back to Germany, present both sides of the argument and refuse to settle it. At the end of this movie, George Clooney's character gives a speech to FDR that provides a positive answer, and it isn't questioned. One is left with the impression that these men risked their lives to save this art because it is important to them and other art historians. Again, there is no connection with a national culture.<br/><br/>Still, this movie is worth seeing. Though I suspect you would be better off reading the book of the same name on which it is named.<br/><br/>-------------------------------<br/><br/>Having now read that book, I repeat that, if you want to know what actually happened, you would be better off reading the book.<br/><br/>However, the movie, I now see, does a remarkable job of drawing a coherent story out of what is a very diffuse tome that would have profited from a LOT of editing. The book tries to create tension and suspense at certain points, but does a poor job of it. It also follows a lot of different threads, but does a poor job of linking them. In short, the book, at over 400 pages, is only for those who really want to know about the history behind this.<br/><br/>If you want a story on this topic, settle for the movie."

"TheMovieDiorama","5","1","3","28 February 2018"," The Monuments Men should've been interesting...it wasn't.
","Films set in World War Two are incredibly popular and the genre has become saturated. There is no room for mediocrity anymore. In comes George Clooney and his famous Hollywood friends to add to the exclusive list of excellent war movies...Ha! Based on the true story of a group of historians going into Europe to recover artistic masterpieces that the Nazi's stole. The film does not do those historians justice, at all. Quite simply this was a mess, narratively speaking. I was hopeful at the start as Clooney and Damon hire the assistance of other historians. Then the movie kicks into second gear and the group are disbanded to various cities across Europe. The narrative consistently shifts between five (...yes five!) different parties of the same unit. This constant switching was ridiculously jarring and I couldn't maintain focus on what the heck was going on. It wasn't a cohesive narrative, it was like watching five separate stories in one film. Not to mention that nothing here was engaging or compelling. Character development was minimal, editing was rushed...this could've, and should've, been executed better. Even the acting felt bland, hardly any acting at all! Only Blanchett and Dujardin felt immersed in the story. Everyone else was just themselves but in costume. Clooney clearly focussed on his directorial efforts and it showed. I honestly think his directing style is great. It's clean, sharp and he isn't afraid to let the actors do their job. I appreciate the light hearted atmosphere, rare these days in a war film but it felt like Dad's Army instead of Saving Private Ryan. There were glimpses of humour, particularly with the land mine scene where our characters actually interacted. But ultimately it was too little too late to save this. Mediocre at best."

From ""Saving Private Ryan"" to ""Fury"" to ""Red Tails"" it all boils down to our band of heroes having to defend some ridiculous objective against a horde of incompetent, suicidal Nazis.<br/><br/>Monument Men is not like that. It tells the story of Allied special agents sent to recover, protect and return works of art.<br/><br/>The characters are likable and interesting, and very human. There have been at least a few flourishes of artistic licence (for instance who would go to the effort to design a land mine that explodes when you step off it?)<br/><br/>I don't know the true story but this seems believable enough to me and I was gripped right up to the very end.<br/><br/>It goes without saying the affects and production are very high quality.

","I am convinced that George Clooney felt compelled to make a statement about the importance of protecting what's essential to Western Civilization. The film says that art is that essential ingredient. Glimpsing the bad and aggravated reviews it's obvious that the message did not get across all that well. My reaction to the film was entirely different from it's louder critics. I have never seen the Ghent Altarpiece nor the Madonna of Bruges. But I made a vow to go see them for myself asap. And I am grateful to Mr. Clooney that he nudged my priorities in the right direction. It is true enough that Clooney should have made a much better film of it all. It is odd to see men supposedly looking for hidden art in dusty cellars and blown-up mine shafts, themselves looking like aging movie stars on a costume picnic in their spotless just off the rack uniforms. On the other hand, repeated departures from any sense of realism seem to be a choice of style rather than just mistakes. I intend to give the film a second chance and just try not to be annoyed by its obvious flaws. After all, as far as war films about art go, there is just this one, so it's the best of it's genre as well as the worst."
"lesleyharris30","8","1","3","15 February 2016"," An Interesting, Courageous True Story,
","The Monuments Men is a great movie with a well developed storyline and a very impressive cast. It's a well acted and dramatic film that also has a lot of nice comedy, it's a really interesting true story about a group of men who put their lives on the line to return artwork to their respective owners. The film also has a lot of heart which I really liked, there's a beautiful scene of Bill Murray listening to a Christmas song that had me in tears, and any scene between Matt Damon and Cate Blanchett develops a very sweet, personal relationship. One thing I thought the movie was lacking was some genuinely intense scenes, for a war film there really aren't any moments that will genuinely have you at the edge of your seat, the plot is certainly slow moving and some well executed scenes that convey the true conflict of this drama would have helped. The film has an outstanding cast that all deliver, Matt Damon shines in what I would consider to be the lead role, George Clooney manages to bring an impressive performance, as well as directing, Cate Blanchett channels Claire Simone perfectly and Bill Murray gives some of his most effective acting in years. Though it may be lacking in intensity, The Monuments Men is a very enjoyable film that is inspired because Clooney clearly wanted this story to be known, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good drama. <br/><br/>A group of soldiers set out to retrieve paintings stolen from the Nazis and return them to their correct location. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Cate Blanchett"

","This movie was loosely adapted from the book of the same name which was originally based on the true story of the world war two. It was a war drama with a theme of the treasure hunt directed by our own George Clooney. The movie had multi top stars who team up for a specially assigned task. Just like the Alistair MacLean stories they lead their way to the war zone to accomplish.<br/><br/>I don't know how much close to the original story it was, but this movie was a bit slow and drag, all the way dull. But not to forget the story intentionally serves its elements to us without surprises and twists. What we really miss was the scenes that pull us to our seat's edge. Yeah, the fast paced furious thrillers, especially in the last few minutes I was desperate for that and it did come, but did not please me. Even the deaths in the movie were not convinced or appeals strongly. Most of the time I thought it was a dark comedy, especially in the last scene of Jean Dujardin.<br/><br/>Other than cinematically transformation fail, I really liked the story. In the real story with real people it would have been a hell of a job than in the movie, which portrays few pieces of the real incident. Heartbreaks to know that many valuables were destroyed during Hitler's invasion of Europe and also makes me happy that these men saved most of it. No doubt, it was a reasonable attempt by George Clooney. Because this story must reach widely to expose these men's bravery and it's only possible through a movie.

"JohnWelles","7","1","3","6 April 2014"," Missed Opportunity, but Still Entertaining
","""The Monuments Men"" (2014), directed by George Clooney, his fifth film behind the camera, makes use of an irresistible premise: recover art works looted by the Nazis during the dying days of World War II. Not only is this a story never told before in the cinema (leading to an aura of uniqueness not often found with Hollywood studio pictures), but Clooney has assembled an enviable cast alongside himself with Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Jean Dujardin, Bob Balaban and Cate Blancett.<br/><br/>Yet as a war film about art, it rarely seems too concerned about the specifics of the paintings and sculptures they're trying to rescue. Jan Van Eyck's Ghent Altarpiece and Michelangelo's ""Madonna and Child"" are the main focus of the film, providing a narrative thread for the script (written by Clooney and Grant Heslov), but the thousands upon thousands of other pieces of art (emphasised by frequent shots of warehouses or mines stacked with canvases) are generalised into anonymous cultural property in the need of preservation. It's frustrating, as are many parts of the film.<br/><br/>It lacks a strong narrative drive, being, until the last third, very episodic â€“ some are fine, like Murray's and Balaban's encounter with a young German soldier at night, but others, such as discovering barrels of gold teeth taken from Jews exterminated by the Holocaust, show the film's inadequacy dealing with the horrors of war. The pathos of members of the team dying and the mass destruction of art in impromptu bonfires lit by the German army are themes it finds hard enough to grasp and make the audience appreciate their impact. It keeps bumping into these big, important topics, the occupation of France and the role of collaborators say, pursuing them for a little while in subplots before backing away, unsure how to proceed, like over the use of child soldiers by the Germans, which is turned into almost an amusing anecdote.<br/><br/>This dichotomy between seriousness and a lighter, caper feel, reminiscent at times of late sixties and early seventies war films (think ""Kelly's Heroes"" (1970) and their ilk, a feeling reinforced by Alexandre Desplat's bass-heavy music score) leads to an uneasily balance not solved by Clooney's at times uncertain and uneven direction. It always looks good thanks to cinematographer Phedon Papamichael's eye for framing, but the characters' speeches, justifying the importance of art even during wartime, sits awkwardly with the more cinematic moments, particularly the climactic race against time to liberate a huge storage of art.<br/><br/>It remains entertaining and well-acted throughout, but it's clear that this is a film which could have been a more powerful exploration of its subject than it is. A missed opportunity then, enjoyable though, despite its failings."

","Despite the anticipated bloody battles of the WW II, The Monuments Men depicts a rather unexpected soft side of the war.

I find this movie to be oddly gripping, realistic, melancholy, and truthful. The main characters live up to their beliefs and stay unwavered even in menacing environment.

","Overall, I am quite surprised at the weak ratings that The Monuments Men, is getting from both critics and audiences. I personally really liked it a lot. No, the film is not action packed with a lot of violence, or explosions, or things like that, and I for one was glad that it wasn't like that. The film wasn't action packed, but I did not find that it had a slow pace, or was boring whatsoever. Instead, I found the film which was based on real people and a true story and events to be respectful and thoughtful about these people, their mission and the subject in general. We get to know the characters a little bit and get to like them and the actors who play them all do a really good job here. The film also looks great and it's attention to detail for that time period is also very impressive. I found the film interesting on a number of different levels. The second world war aspect of the film was interesting enough, but I also found the story of these men who went in and tried to uncover these various pieces of stolen art masterpieces to be equally as interesting and that is more or less where the film places it's focus. I think because I love art and respect it, that the whole art recovery and search part of the film intrigued me and just seeing these masterpieces stolen and later being searched for was intriguing to me. I also liked how the film kept everything low key and did not overly elaborate, or embellish things making it feel more realistic and less like a major Hollywood film. If this had been filled with action, explosions and a lot of violence, I do not feel that it personally would have worked. Instead we have a much quieter and gentler film which is more sensitive to both the subject of the war and also has it's appreciation of art and these men deeply embedded in it's appreciation in this film. I personally cared for the characters in this film and the mission they were on and I really did want them to uncover and find all this stolen art. Whether they do or not, I will not give away for those who have not seen the film. Overall, I was very impressed with the film's look, tone and quiet and yet respectful treatment of the subject. Some may find it slower moving and may be a bit disappointed with it, but I found there more to take in and appreciate with the film being that way. I hope more people give The Monuments Men, a chance because I personally found it to be great and I know that there is an audience out there who will think the same as I did."
"GoUSN","Null","1","3","23 February 2014"," Flat script; flat acting with flashes of brilliance
","Though we appeared to dedicate more attention to captured art in 1943 than we did to the known plight of imprisoned Jews about to be slaughtered, I still wanted to see this film done well. Putting aside whether we the Allies should have taken earlier action of some form against the string of known camps, art too is a voice for all time - so I certainly understand the incentive to save it, particularly where our entire western civilization and humanity's brightest light, risked being obliterated. I respect George Clooney's goals here.<br/><br/>But wasn't the problem George Clooney? I'll start with his podium readings to Roosevelt and Truman. Flat, so flat that a passer-by could have been just as effective. Wouldn't that segment have been better used by having the presentation just as a voice-over, with visible content consisting of Jews being rousted from their homes, their belongings inventoried and stole, throughout Europe? Why should Clooney have monopolized the scenes? He simply was dramatically empty, even with his powerful message.<br/><br/>Because he was the director, that's why. If he wants the spotlight, he as director can shine it. And that, here, was a significant failure. No one said (or was able to say) perhaps that's not the best intro, George. A little too much of you, George.<br/><br/>Too much George! The movie did turn in some acting tour de forces. Cate Blanchett was a revelation. Bob Balaban too.

","This is an outstanding bit of movie entertainment! I just saw it and was mightily impressed by it.<br/><br/>The story is compelling, the scripting is top-notch, the dialog is a gem, the acting is superb, the casting is excellent, the production values are lush, and the attention to detail is superb.<br/><br/>Originally due out late last year, the folks at Columbia & Fox realized they had something more than a ""Clooney / Damon caper movie"" on their hands and pushed it to this year. It was a wise decision on their part.<br/><br/>Based on the real story of the Allied effort to retrieve and return the artworks looted by the Nazis, ""Monuments Men"" does an excellent job of turning that tale into an engaging, compelling, exciting, saddening, and uplifting tale that is well worth seeing.<br/><br/>I expected something a bit more ""adult"" than the original ""Clooney / Damon caper movie"" it was first depicted as - but was surprised and pleased at what the movie actually is. Yup, there's plenty of snappy dialog and humorous situations. Yes, Clooney and Damon are in fine form together. So too however, are Goodman, Murray, Balaban, Dujardin, Blanchett and all others involved. As an example, Blanchett's ""Claire Simone"" character is a very well rendered Parisian one when it comes to the proper use of French.<br/><br/>The tale could've easily become a farce with these actors / characters depicted as some sort of historian / art expert action heroes winning the war all on their own. Thankfully, the movie and tale is nothing like that. It does show them as being at the front lines and suffering the consequences for that. But it wisely depicts them as exactly who they are - art experts who happen to be in uniform and not combat troops ordered to be art experts. The movie does an excellent job of depicting the difficulties of that situation and its results.<br/><br/>And the production values of the film make it a joy to behold. Location shots abound. Any CGI used to enhance those settings is done seamlessly and thus enhances the story first and foremost. One thing which particularly impressed me was the movie's use of period equipment in exacting detail and specificity.<br/><br/>When there's a scene involving a British Army unit moving out - they're using Bedford QLDs to do so. When there's a scene of a Red Army unit driving 'round - they're doing so in their GAZ-67 ""jeeps"" and their Zil trucks. This, when it would also have been perfectly appropriate to have depicted them driving 'round in American built vehicles as we supplied plenty of them to them via Lend-Lease. Nope, that just wouldn't do here! And that sort of attention to detail abounds throughout the film.<br/><br/>Paying attention to what's going on on screen is also highly rewarding here. There are plenty of details presented in a realistically understated manner that are all the more compelling for it.<br/><br/>This is an excellent two hours worth of movie entertainment and well worth watching."

Starting from the silly music that made me feel like watching a Police Academy movie to the stupid situations taking place in the destroyed Europe at the end of the World War II...really?

","Originally, The Monuments Men was supposed to come out during December so it would be in prime position for Awards Season, unfortunately there was something wrong with the special effects and it was pushed back to February, after the deadline for the Oscars and in the midst of ""dump month."" It was greeted with not so good reviews, most of them got it pretty right, but it wasn't all that bad.<br/><br/>The Monuments Men is not the best movie of the year, far from it. George Clooney, who wrote, directed, produced, and starred in it does a decent enough job at adapting the 512 page book into a movie that is less than 2 hours. The acting is good, nobody really stands out among the star studded cast that includes Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Jean Dujardin, and Cate Blanchett, because well, there isn't a whole lot for them to do. The comedy works well at times, with Matt Damon rattling off some of the movies funniest quips, while Bill Murray does his usual thing as well.<br/><br/>For those of you who don't know what this movie is about; it is the story of a group of artists, architects, and other people involved in the art community who set off for Europe to recover the art that Germany has stolen and is likely to either destroy or display in Hitler's dream museum once he wins the war. It is a race against time, for while the Allies are heading east, inadvertently destroying buildings and artworks in their path, the Germans are hiding away and destroying the art on purpose. Yet the movies biggest problem is it never feels like there's anything to really be concerned about, it never feels like the race against time the trailers and even the actors in the movie say it is. Most of the film focuses on our characters sitting around and talking about home, or Matt Damon flirting with Cate Blanchett, or in one scene Bill Murray, Bob Balaban, and some random German soldier just sit on the ground and smoke a cigarette. There is no sense of urgency, no real concern about what they are actually there for.<br/><br/>But for as many times as George Clooney can talk about ""saving the culture"" or whatever his line is that he spews at least half a dozen times, we do not see a whole lot of art saving until the last third of the film. We are beat over the head with this message about trying to race against time to save where we come from, but for the most part, it's just a whole lot of sitting around waiting for something to happen.<br/><br/>Now, I have read the book that is the basis for this movie, and I feel it would have stood far stronger as a miniseries. The book is even set into 5 different parts that could have each served as an episode. But, George Clooney tried so hard to pack everything into one short movie that we feel we are missing out on some of the action.<br/><br/>The movie is very entertaining for the most part, but it would not be correct to say that it is a nail-biting race to the end in order to save these ""monuments."" It does have its moments that remind us what these people were fighting for, but it also leaves us wanting more. Hopefully this story can be revisited in the future and given the proper attention that this grand and epic story deserves, for what we get is a watered down and condensed version of what is and could be a truly great tale.<br/><br/>For more of my reviews, check out ragingfilm.com"

","It is no surprise that The Monuments Men was one of the most anticipated titles of last year. The cast, the story, the trailers all made the movie look like an instant classic.

It should have been great. The problem lies in the way the story is presented: There doesn't seem to be any continuation. It's as if the chapters were created on their own, and placed with no regard to the story whatsoever. The script is too cheesy and often feels out of place, not something you would expect from a movie like this. <br/><br/>The cast looks promising, the characters they play don't.

"FilmMuscle","Null","1","3","15 February 2014"," Not Quite So Monumental
","As if you didn't have enough ammunition to despise Adolf Hitler, The Monuments Men exposes the Nazis' additional goals to eradicate the precious artworks of the world, essentially erasing the history and legacies of many. In this fictionalized recount, Frank Stokes (played by George Clooney) assembles an inexperienced crew of cohorts to take back these most prized paintings, sculptures, and whatnot from the Nazis and return them to their rightful owners. What basically teases a remarkable cast- comprising your favorite actors/comedians- only reveals itself to be a broken promise. What it is is the year's first major disappointment since I could honestly find very few redeeming qualities in its content, if any at all. <br/><br/>Most of the cast (from the likes of George Clooney, Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Jean Dujardin, Cate Blanchett, and more) are just playing themselves, and even then, a lot of them are severely underrepresented and aren't given the proper amount of time to shine. Specifically, I have no idea who chose to cast Cate Blanchett as a Frenchwoman- wildly unconvincing, especially considering her inconsistent accent. This might feel somewhat like a digression, but I am immensely irritated by Hollywood's overt reliance on either British or American actors. Was it too difficult to find a French actress to play that role? We've got Marion Cotillard, Juliette Binoche, Julie Delpy, Bérénice Bejo- case in point: an abundance of highly talented French actresses you could've effortlessly fit into that role, but nope, apparently, Hollywood requires for every other European nationality- from Russians to the French- to be portrayed by British or American actors because they're ""Oscar winners and they can probably play anything,"" right? <br/><br/>Anyways, back to the film itself, we could've easily had a plethora of memorable interactions, comedic or dramatic, but too much time is wasted on flat jokes and unnecessary, insipid dialogue- too much dwelling on the characters' personal lives and pasts that unfortunately adds nothing to their complexity (there is none). Most importantly, the film loses quite a bit of intrigue and appeal with every passing minute; it's definitely not as engaging and entertaining as it had the potential to be. Simply put, it's terribly dragged out and the ending is fairly anti-climactic. A considerable portion of the film is largely uneventful. I mean, what are they even exactly doing for the first hour and a half? During this catastrophic and traumatizing period, the characters have an amusing time walking around and chatting, but there's absolutely no hint of progress until the very last quarter of the narrative. It's a whole lot of exposition that leads to an embarrassingly unsatisfying climax. <br/><br/>As I was saying, the picture is pervaded by humor but to an excessive and unrestrained extent, which only lends itself to failure since the majority of the jokes fall flat (a few effectively deliver, and even those are eventually played out). There were a few scenes that finally unraveled with the right emotional or thematic impact, but those were very, very few and far between. The premise had my attention but again the movie slaughtered its potential even if it put in some effort. All in all, The Monuments Men was George Clooney's first directorial (transparent) dud that's acutely forgettable and surprisingly void of any entertainment. I would've much rather settled for a documentary to delineate this fascinating historical event."

","This film should be far more engaging than it is. It is about six men selected to retrieve art works stolen by the Nazis, and Bill Murray is in it. That should be enough to make it a near classic. However it never really reaches the comedic or dramatic potential promised in the trailer which is in fact a better experience than the film itself. Part of the reason for this is the lack of momentum caused by the story being spread between the different stories of the cast. Things seem to meander along without a great sense of urgency and as a result the audience may be compelled to feel slightly disinterested. If any art is going to be saved can everyone involved hurry up. Considering the cast and the plot this film could have been allot more fun. The editing itself does not grip the attention. Just one good map reading scene and a couple of arguments between the characters about what they were up against would've made some difference.

""The Monuments Men"" assembles a cast in very much the way as post-World War II films like ""Command Decision,"" which brought together Clark Gable, Walter Pidgeon, Van Johnson, Brian Donlevy, Charles Bickford, John Hodiak, and Edward Arnold in a compelling but largely forgotten study of the military vs. politics. Forgotten in much the same way ""The Monuments Men"" is likely to be forgotten in 60 years, even thought it stars George Clooney, Matt Damon, John Goodman, Bill Murrary, Jean DuJardin, Kate Blanchette, Bob Balaban, and Hugh Bonneville.<br/><br/>You have to give director and star Clooney credit for bringing to the screen this tale, based on historical events, of a group of art experts drafted into the military to recover paintings and sculpture looted from across Europe by the invading Nazis. Their sacrifice, their harrowing mission, saved countless works of art destined for destruction by Hitler and his team of vandals, who believed that if they couldn't have them nobody else would either.<br/><br/>I was reading ""The Clarinet Polka"" by Keith Maillard, a 2002 novel that's been waiting on my bookshelf for a dozen years. In this wickedly funny book about life in a Polish community in West Virginia, I read on page 107: ""To Mrs. Dluwiecki, everything that was good and true and beautiful was Poland before the war. She went on and on about the beautiful china and crystal and silver her family used to have, and all the oil paintings that'd been in the family for generations. She remembered all the fancy outfits she'd ever worn, and she described them to Janice down to the finest detail. She even remembered things like her white veil and her little white shoes from her first Communion that she'd saved in a special wooden box, and the little silver scissors her mother had used to cut the roses-and all that beautiful stuff was gone, lost, plundered by the Germans. She didn't even have any photographs from those days. She said she'd lost her precious heritage and all she had left was memory."" And so it was with millions of Poles-Jews and Gentiles-who lost their heritage, their homes, and six million of them their lives in the Holocaust. I put the book on the coffee table and went to see ""The Monuments Men.""<br/><br/>Set in France and Germany, it was disappointing that ""The Monuments Men"" mentioned Poland only once in the entire film when early on George Clooney, as leader of the group, explains that the Nazis have been ""stealing art from Amsterdam, Warsaw, and Paris."" Historically, the Allies never came to Poland's rescue, and the movie shows the Americans narrowly missing the Russian army as it advanced into Germany, having already ""liberated"" (meaning taken over) Poland. Late in the film we see, but only if we are alert enough to notice, that Leonardo da Vinci's ""Lady with an Ermine"" (now hanging in the Czatoryski Museum in Krakow) is one of the paintings these brave men recovered.<br/><br/>Historically interesting and beautiful to watch, ""The Monuments"" Men somehow falls short of generating in the audience the kind of passion for art that possessed the lead characters. How much more compelling this film would have been in the hands of Poland's great director Andrzej Wajda."

","The Monuments Men brought together a great story with a great cast, but lacked anything else. I believe the only reason someone would watch it is because of either the cast or the story (that is the reason I watched it). Interesting enough to keep my attention throughout the whole movie, but that is only carried by the story which I feel was a pretty safe story not to mess up. Even this adequate portrayal of what happened during this WWII art mission flick was enough to keep me on my seat. I would recommend it to people, but only because, I believe other people would be interested in what happened and possibly to see a stellar cast make you chuckle a bit.<br/><br/>I was very impressed with Cate Blanchett's portrayal of a french art curator. I thought her accent was impeccable and her sass and attitude of her character (Claire Simone) was a joy to watch. I felt the other actors performed like characters they had played before, very predictable but I wouldn't say boring. They as were expected, which, for actors of their stature is not bad.<br/><br/>Overall this film felt like an interesting history lesson with an unnecessarily overqualified cast. I felt it missed a few of the marks in some of the more emotional scenes and maybe could have upped the stakes a bit in regards to having a more stand out villain.

","This film tells me a lot. I am a historian, I understand the importance of art, the historical and artistic heritage, and I am well aware of the irreparable loss that all wars cause in the cultural heritage of nations. Portugal, my country, has always kept distance from European conflicts, a situation conditioned by geography, but which has allowed my country to pass through raindrops and to be spared in many times of difficulty. Even so, we know what a large-scale war is: we were invaded by Napoleon Bonaparte, with great devastation and loss of life and property, and many pieces of art (mainly sacred art, furniture and jewelery) were stolen and taken to France at that time. So, watching this film and seeing the efforts of a handful of men to save pieces of European culture is something that has meaning for me because it is something that, in such a dramatic war, I would also be able to offer to do. Yes, without a doubt ... it is worth risking to save pieces of art and culture that are truly irreplaceable and allow them to return to their rightful owners.<br/><br/>George Clooney is a multifaceted man. Director, screenwriter, one of the main actors ... he certainly embraced this project with commitment, and the cast is full of stars like Matt Damon, Cate Blanchett, Hugh Bonneville and Bill Murray, great actors who have, in the past, given proof of talent beyond any doubt. The problem is that there are so many good actors that I felt that they never reached the potential they deserved, limiting themselves to a warm and sometimes lazy performance. So much money and good human capital involved and Clooney doesn't know how to take advantage of all this and make an incredible movie with these stars?<br/><br/>The script is good and the story told is very interesting. In fact, the film entertains and captures the audience but it is a little boring to feel that, in some parts, it tries to be dramatic and, minutes later, it is desperately trying to make us laugh. The length of the film is also a bit exaggerated, given the story told. At a technical level, the film has good production values: a photograph that is pleasing to the eye, good sound, visual and CGI effects, good costumes and scenery, but something that really surprises us is missing. It is a very average film in everything. And the most tiring is the soundtrack ... composed by Alexandre Desplat, it constantly sounds adventure with touches of comedy and announces a light and fun film, with some sense of grandeur. Actually, the film has funny parts but it lacks that sense of adventure and has nothing grand or epic about it, which makes the soundtrack a little too presumptuous.<br/><br/>I liked this film for its message about the importance of heritage, culture and preservation. I liked the story told and felt that the film is worth it but there is nothing fantastic or special about it. It's just another movie set in World War II, good for spending some idle time and nothing more."

You'd ask who goes out there in the middle of a bloodbath for sake of art? These heroes did! Why? Because Art defines humanity & how Art stands tall for its time & beyond. 2 of its heroes even lost their lives while on their mission & guess what, their sacrifice wasn't only to save art, but also humanity that lies beneath the masterpieces we talk about to date. Be it Michelangelo's Madonna or an Eyck's Ghent Altarpiece to name a few, remain as Artful & are considered as Creatives Masterpieces. And these heroes made sure they remained among us, despite the violence & menace all around them. Now that's Heroism!<br/><br/>And it helps that the cinematic motion-picture about these heroes is bought to life by Oscar-Winning Film Giant - George Clooney. Keeping the pace moving & his direction consistently deft, Clooney delivers a film that offers some inspired laughs & a number of fascinating moments, that win you over. Of course, Clooney & Grant Heslov's Writing isn't always tight & the tone shifts from light to dull at times, but overall, this is a fascinating story that you might have not even heard of, but should experience, to respect its heroes. Clooney knows his job & while he can Write better, he sure knows how to direct & create an atmosphere for its subject matter. Phedon Papamichael's Cinematography, Stephen Mirrione's Editing, Alexandre Desplat's Score & the Excellent Production Design, merit a special mention. <br/><br/>Performance-Wise: Clooney delivers, yet again! He delivers an entirely committed performance, that never hits a wrong mark. Matt Damon is terrific, as always. Its nice to see this versatile actor indulge himself in a strong supporting role. Cate Blanchett is extra-ordinary. Her sequences with Damon, stand out. John Goodman & Bill Murray deserved meatier roles & lines, but add to the narrative by just appearing here. Bob Balaban is top-notch. Hugh Bonneville & Jean Dujardin leave a mark. <br/><br/>On the whole, 'The Monuments Men' is definitely watchable."

My son (19 when it came out) saw it 3 times in the first 2 weeks! I've seen it 5 times so far.

","You can see The Monuments Men was well shot. I liked what Clooney was doing, putting an Ocean's Eleven flavor in a World War II setting, and the Director of Photography Phedon Papamichael does quality work on films with large exterior landscapes like Nebraska (2013), The Descendants (2011) and 3:10 to Yuma (2007). Furthermore, you couldn't ask for a better cast. There was a lot of expectation for this movie to pick up Oscar and Golden Globe nods which is why it was originally scheduled for a December release (but later moved to February). In spite of its assets, however, in the end it leaves you somewhat disappointed.<br/><br/>Three main issues that made me think this could have been a gem, if only. First is that it couldn't decide if it was a comedy or a serious historical movie. Usually a drama has some humor, and a historical comedy has drama. This one felt like a tug of war between the two, and in the end there was no clear winner.<br/><br/>Second was the editing. They could have shed 3 or 4 scenes without sacrificing the story, and trimmed a few others to keep the movie from lagging. But then in the DVD Bonus Features you see them shoot a victory scene with large crowds; why was that cut from the theatrical version?<br/><br/>And third, as phenomenal as Alexandre Desplat's score was, some scenes felt like they were missing music, again giving us a tug of war between a lush Hollywood production and French minimalism. Maybe it was re-edited at the last moment and some scenes were left bare.<br/><br/>So there you have it, one of the most interesting stories of World War II that could have been an awards favorite. I put it somewhere in the Top 15 non-violent, non-atrocity WWII films. They are (not necessarily in order):<br/><br/>1. The Bridge on the River Kwai 2. The Imitation Game 3. Casablanca 4.

But I could add to that, that it is interesting. It is based on real events. Although I get that many scenes and events had to be altered for dramatic effect, it doesn't change that the fact that many of the described pieces were in fact stolen and recovered. Not by a handful men as in the movie, but by a designated unit.<br/><br/>The depressing part is that, as the movie shows, many pieces of art were lost and are still missing, their fates sometimes unknown. For example the Amber Room, which is still searched for. But perhaps the most depressing was a scene were the men find a barrel full of teeth gold.

He assembles a ragtag squadron from different units (and even different armies) and they are plunged into a desperate race against time to save the works before it's too late.<br/><br/>The terrible antics of ISIS have been in the news lately, with their various atrocities around the world, but mention was given to the ancient monuments they smashed to pieces in the Middle Eastern countries they've invaded, representing centuries of culture. It's a tactic they've obviously taken on from fanatics of time gone past, not simply wanting to eradicate a whole race of people, but also all the items of value that their culture produced, so that they're dead in people's memories, as well as physically. George Clooney's full bodied, all star homage to gung ho, cavalier war films of times gone past, takes the traditional war film, and applies it to a different type of story.<br/><br/>An all star cast, made up of mostly older heads, with Matt Damon probably being the youngest, adds to the old fashioned feel of it all, with John Goodman before he lost so much weight, and Bill Murray, who can wonderfully channel the same expression to convey feelings of laughter and feelings of sadness. Adding to the Sunday afternoon feel of it all is a lack of depiction in the brutal, blood drenched reality of war, just ambling along and telling the story the way it would have in the 40s and 50s. But it is Clooney's show all the way, his affection for the type of film he's copying the style of beautifully evident.<br/><br/>It's all wrapped up quite wonderfully too, unlike a lot of war films at under the two hour mark, making for a much more condensed affair. I'm not sure why it's attracted as much scorn as it has. All in all, it's a pretty forgettable experience, with nothing to really make it stand out from other films of it's type, other than being about a mission to save paintings than people. In that sense at least, it's daring and ambitious, and while the results are pretty hit and miss, it's no more hit than miss. ***"

It would be an impossible mission: with the art trapped behind enemy lines, and with the German army under orders to destroy everything as the Reich fell, how could these guys - seven museum directors, curators, and art historians, all more familiar with Michelangelo than the M-1 - possibly hope to succeed?

","One review that I read before watching ""The Monuments Men"" stated that it was an old-fashioned type of movie. After seeing it, I tend to agree with that statement. It takes its subject matter very seriously for the most part, and instead of being lightening fast like most modern Hollywood movies, the pace is slow and deliberate. Nothing wrong with that in theory, but writer/director/actor George Clooney doesn't quite manage to pull it off. The movie is so solemn and serious that it almost becomes boring many times through its almost two hour running time. Some action or a few more attempts at humor would have helped. The subject matter is worthy of a movie, and the recreation of the time and place does come across as authentic, but I see that most people will probably squirm in their seats from a lack of patience with the end results."

","The Monuments Men is a 2014 American-German film directed by George Clooney, written and produced by Clooney and Grant Heslov, and starring Clooney, Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Jean Dujardin, Bob Balaban, Hugh Bonneville, and Cate Blanchett. Based on the non-fiction book, a 500 or so page tome entitled The Monuments Men: Allied Heroes, Nazi Thieves and the Greatest Treasure Hunt in History by Robert M. Edsel, the film relates the true story of a motley group of aging art experts tasked with finding and saving pieces of art and other culturally important items before their destruction by Hitler and the Nazis during the waning days of World War II.<br/><br/>Originally scheduled to be released in December of 2013, the film appeared on American screens in early February 2014 several weeks before the Oscars were handed out for excellence in Hollywood movie making for the preceding year. The selection of films and performances presented for consideration from 2013 had few heroes. We had stories about a bunch of Somali pirates, a corrupt Wall Street swindler, a dysfunctional family in Oklahoma, a Texas hustler who profited from importing AIDS medications, another sad tale of slavery, and a spinster trying to sell her tales to Walt Disney.<br/><br/>George Clooney is to be praised for bringing the story of a few aging ""art warriors"" to the big screen. The Monuments Men tried to preserve Europe's cultural history by volunteering to find about five million pieces of artwork stolen by the Nazis from wealthy Jews, museums, universities and churches before they were destroyed. It's a heroic adventure, the largest treasure hunt ever conceived. And a true story about some of the men and women from 13 countries who gave their time, talent, and effort for this worthwhile cause. Over 6,500 paintings were found at the salt mines in Altaussee, Austria. Gold bullion and 400 paintings from Berlin vaults were found in the copper mines in Merkers, Germany. Entire valuable private collections of wealthy Frenchmen were found at Neuschwanstein Castle in Germany. Important works such as the ""Madonna of Bruges"" by Michelangelo and Van Eyck's medieval Ghent altarpiece were salvaged.<br/><br/>Interestingly, The Monuments Men is not a war movie: it's Saving Mr. Rembrandt not Saving Private Ryan. And it's not really a humor-in-the-time-of-war film like Mash nor a comedic-drama like Oceans Eleven although Clooney plays a Harvard art restorer who gathers his ""buds"" for the adventure and some fun. It's a profound bit of historical and biographical drama. And it's about heroes.<br/><br/>Hollywood needs more movies about heroes."

There are some stunning scenes as the soldiers go into mines and discover huge numbers of treasures. There are also some moving scenes, particularly concerning the character of Donald (Bonneville).<br/><br/>We really don't find out too much about the soldiers, but the script has a lot of humor and repartee in it, making it like the Oceans Eleven films Clooney stars in with Damon and others.

"watchthisspacefilmmagazi","8","0","2","16 December 2014"," Bill Murray + John Goodman = Success!
","Monuments Men (2014) was a film I had been looking forward to since I saw the trailer earlier this year. I had high hopes for it and, as a whole, I think it delivered. <br/><br/>The film is based on the true story of a group of art historians, museum directors and curators who, during World War 2, were tasked to locate, preserve and recover the countless pieces of art stolen by the Nazis. It leads to the most extravagant and dangerous treasure hunt in history as we follow these unlikely heroes as they travel all over the continent retrieving and preserving the culture of war-torn Europe. <br/><br/>The first thing that drew me to this film was the cast, and the great array of talent they managed to get in this picture. My favourite comical actor, Bill Murray, gave a 'classic Murray' performance riddled with dry wit and humorous jabs aimed at his comrades. Another favourite comedy actor of mine, John Goodman, played a great role too, delivering some quality lines which had me laughing out loud (literally lol). <br/><br/>Everyone else did a great job, especially Cate Blanchett who played her character to perfection, keeping that convincing French accent up throughout is no mean feat and she did it wonderfully. George Clooney and Matt Damon brought their usual talent to the film delivering the high quality performance that we have come to expect from these two. <br/><br/>What a lot of critics have picked up on was the direction of the film, they didn't know what it was trying to be. Is it a war film? Drama? Caper? Well I saw it as a film tackling a serious subject in a sometimes comical, sometimes serious way. Whereas this has been a drawback for a lot of critics, I found this to be one of the things I liked about the film. <br/><br/>Why must we set out the genre of film in black and white? Why must we say 'this is a war film so it cannot contain any moments of joy, any laughs?' I think what director George Clooney did was brave and I think he pulled it off. It was serious when it needed to be, emotional in parts and funny in others. Solider trying to make light of their situation is something we have seen in films, but with the talents of Murray and Goodman, they managed to pull it off wonderfully. <br/><br/>I think what Clooney cleverly did was, knowing he wanted to create some funny moments in a serious story and retain the respect owed to the soldiers who did this, choose his cast carefully. He needed some funny actors, ones that could genuinely make the audience laugh, but he needed it to be subtle, so choosing Murray and Goodman was a stroke of genius. If he would have gone the other route and recruited mainstream comical actors such as Ben Stiller, Adam Sandler or anyone of the like then we would have had another film completely and one which would have failed miserably. <br/><br/>So all in all, I think this was a great film. It told a story I had not heard before and showed us World War 2 from a different point of view while raising some very interesting points. You can destroy a population, kill everyone and they will live on in their culture, their art. Allow that to be destroyed and you lose the people."

However, nobody in this film delivers memorable performances and you know nothing about there characters and I even believe some of them could have been completely written out of the film. The story had the potential to be exciting but the story is a complete snooze fest and hard to watch. A big problem is that this was billed as a team film but you barely see the team altogether, also matt Damon isn't even in the team for the majority of the film.

I have never experienced such a waste of opportunities. A good - true - story, good caste of experienced actors, and the potential for some action, as well as some photogenic scenes, should have led to a reasonable film. It fails because it is badly written and badly directed. It is also poorly conceived - a comedy drama on such topic! <br/><br/>On a side note, there is a lot of confusion about Nazi art, in this film and more generally. The Germans both bought and stole art, from Jew and non-Jew. The treatment of artworks at the end of the war didn't always clearly distinguish between these different categories. There was a notorious incident in which the real Monuments Men resisted orders from their military superiors to send several hundred works of art to the USA, as war spoils. Unfortunately, although the western Allies, generally behaved responsibly, the Soviets stole what they wanted. Even today, many of those people who lost art to the Germans and then to the Soviets are still waiting for the return of their property.

Here he reunites with Grant Heslov again (the two won a Best Picture Academy Award for Argo not too long ago and also collaborated on Good Night and Good Luck) and is also back in the directing chair three years after The Ides of March..<br/><br/>""The Monuments Men"" was the first movie I saw with a 2014 release date and it was a swell start into the year. The cast truly makes this one worth watching, especially the Dujardin/Goodman pairing was nothing short of wonderful. Bill Murray who I'm a great fan of has his funny moments too and makes a nice duo with Bob Balaban. All the supporting characters are really the heart and soul of the film. Cate Blanchett creates an interesting more serious character and the only one in the cast who left me rather uninterested was Hugh Bonneville, maybe also because I've never been too big on Downton Abbey.<br/><br/>All in all, it's a really good movie. There's very minor weaknesses, such as the US flag near the end which made it a bit too patriotic for my taste or that they of course find the paintings the very last second and manage to get them away, which was all just too expected, but these are just minor criticisms. It's a wonderful movie, historically significant and with lots of humor and I especially liked the final scene with the old version of Clooney's character actually played by Clooney's real father.

","The Monuments Men is what we call an ensemble cast film where you get as many prolific actors you can pull in and then build the movie around their acting capabilities. And usually the end result is at least halfway decent, just because it's so much fun to see these people working together. Likewise here. Pretty much all of the actors are A-list and it shows. From George Clooney and Matt Damon to Bill Murray, Cate Blanchett and John Goodman, they all shine and have great conversations and scenes together.<br/><br/>Not to say that it isn't otherwise a good movie. The setting is very intriguing, being based on a real life World War II unit of the same name, which mission was to find and protect the pieces of history, art and culture the Nazis had stolen or were trying to steal. The film feels passionately about the importance of art as a basis of culture and as a proof we have existed. Yet it's one thing to claim that art is important and quite another to ask good men and women to potentially sacrifice their lives for it. And the movie doesn't shy away from that problem. It makes its point and allows you to draw your own conclusions.<br/><br/>As for the technical side of things, some people have claimed that the film feels a touch boring and scrambled because we follow so many small groups simultaneously, without ever really focusing on one. And I can see their point. It requires you to pay attention, to remember what is going on with each group and to not mind the pauses in the story lines. I personally didn't have problems with the storytelling and I found the whole experience a great deal of fun. It takes place in war times and acknowledges the human horror going on, but at its heart it's a treasure hunt and thus feels warmhearted and charming.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a bit lighter war movie with great actors, excellent setup and beautiful production values, look no further."

Since that war - now known as World War I - created the conditions and caused World War II, that makes ""The Monuments Men"" all the more important. Hitler's rise to power and subsequent occupation of Europe could never have come to pass without the crippling reparations imposed on Germany at the Versailles negotiations. That in addition to the fact that at the negotiations, the racist crook Woodrow Wilson refused to listen to a young Ho Chi Minh, setting the stage for the Vietnam War, and the carving up of the former Ottoman Empire by the British and French set the stage for the current horror in the Middle East. Basically, the so-called War to End All Wars set the stage for all future wars. Gavrilo Princip was simply resisting the occupation of his land and he inadvertently changed the course of history.<br/><br/>The movie itself isn't a masterpiece but is still worth seeing. It's a funny collection of characters, especially Bill Murray's character. And of course it's neat to see Neuschwanstein Castle (which also appeared in the 1962 movie ""The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm""); I once put together a 6,000-piece jigsaw puzzle showing that castle.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, movies need to get made about the conditions that drove Gavrilo Princip to assassinate Franz Ferdinand and about the Versailles negotiations. Whether it's the Israel-Palestine conflict (caused by the Sykes-Picot Agreement), the horror that the former Yugoslavia witnessed in the 1990s (caused by the artificial creation of the Yugoslav kingdom), or the Russia-Georgia War (rooted in the Armenian Genocide), it seems that almost every part of the planet remains f***ed up because of World War I."

Even great actors like Clooney himself, Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, etc. were unable to improve the hectic script, consisting of different places in Europe at the same time - as they spent too little time on screen and their characters were not elaborated. Funny dialogs were pertinent only at times, they were mostly meant to make dull search for creations more ""interesting"" and smooth... Human connections/relations remained incomplete, and the movie is, in fact, a chronological and arid presentation of events not commonly known from WW II. <br/><br/>Luckily, this 2-hour-movie does not become dull or annoying, but it is still a good example that important awards' winners and nominees do not automatically ensure a catchy and influential story. With ordinary/unknown actors, the movie might have become a flop."

","Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>""The Monuments Men"" which has a great cast, isn't an Oscar material, and it does not try to be one.

It's not ""Schindlers List"" , it's a nice adventure flick set in the II world war, based on the real events, about group of art lovers, who were saving art in the surrounding of hell. <br/><br/>Overall, 8/10 for this flick, and skip the highly negative reviews, this is a quite, and very solid entertainment."

","George Clooney's retelling of an audacious plot by a group of aging art specialists to rescue stolen art from Nazi-occupied Europe is highly entertaining, so long as viewers don't take it too seriously. With its jaunty theme music (by Alexandre Desplat), devil-may-care theme and tongue-in-cheek humor, it is a movie with its roots in classic World War II dramas such as John Sturges' THE GREAT ESCAPE (1963). Structurally speaking, THE MONUMENTS MEN is very similar - a group of representatives of assorted nations take on the full might of the Nazi army (as well as some obstructive American and British officers) and manage to achieve their goals through a combination of cunning, luck and sheer brazenness. THE MONUMENTS MEN is a little propagandist in tone; there is little need, for instance, for a shot at the end of the film showing the American flag, a ""present"" left for the advancing Russian army once the monuments men have rescued some stolen treasure. Nonetheless the film's theme is highly pertinent in view of the destruction wrought to many irreplaceable art treasures in Iraq and Syria in recent years: one hopes that similar groups will be formed so as to save some of them. The actors enjoy themselves in their roles, notably Matt Damon as James Granger, an American officer speaking incomprehensible French, and Bob Balaban and Bill Murray as a pair of perpetually warring art specialists., Cate Blanchett turns in an agreeable cameo as French spy - with a convincing accent. Definitely watchable, so long as audiences don't take the subject-matter too seriously."

","Though it's painfully thin, poorly structured and full of clichés, George Clooney's 'The Monuments Men' is a fun movie that shines a light, however dim, on a mostly forgotten or ignored part of World War II.<br/><br/>Taking its cues from films like 'The Dirty Dozen', 'The Monuments Men' struggles to keep a balance between its lighthearted tone and the very serious events it portrays. It's a tricky thing to do, and it's not always successful. But thanks to its talented cast, jaunty manner and gorgeous production values, 'The Monuments Men' manages to overcome its flaws and deliver a fairly entertaining--if ultimately inconsequential--film."

","It is easy to give marketing departments a hard time – for giving away too much in the credits or for showing the good bits or just for making a terrible film look good. In regard to this film, the marketing seems to be in the same boat as the viewer because it is really hard to know how to sell Monuments Men when the film itself seems not to know what it wants to do or be. The story is a true one, of an action to save works of art from being lost or destroyed as the Nazi's begin their retreat across Europe. As such there must be a good story in here somewhere but it is not really to be found here.<br/><br/>The story it tells is all well and good but for some reason it is not particularly well structured as it has characters and actions split up without ever really making a good connection between them until later in the film and by then it is too little too late. The uneven story telling is one thing, but it is the uneven tone that is the bigger problem. At times it is somber, other times it wants to Ocean's WWII, then it is serious again, then it is comedic – it is not impossible to mix the content like this but it is hard to do and this film just feels like they were spinning a ""what type of film is this"" wheel before shooting each scene.<br/><br/>As the film doesn't work it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the starry cast are wasted – because frankly they are. Some of them don't know what film they are in, while some of them are playing it 100% certain what film they are in – it just happens to be a different one from other people. I'm not sure what went wrong with it, but it does flap around all over the place with Clooney seeming to be unable to get control of it. It doesn't help that it runs to almost 2 hours, because that is way too long for a film that doesn't work.<br/><br/>There are moments in here and perhaps for some the interest in the real story may be enough to keep the interest, but for me I found it too consistently uneven in terms of its tone and its structure."

","Something went wrong in transforming history onto the big screen. Based on a book by Robert M. Edsel and Bret Witter and adapted for the screen by director George Clooney and Grant Heslov, this true story gets all Hallmarky despite the theme and a fine cast. The problem is that the mystery has been removed and in its place are series of actor shots paying homage to the real monuments men of history. As a result we really don't get to know about any of them and the mission becomes a game, a dangerous and courageous at times game, but a game nevertheless.<br/><br/>Based on the premise of Clooney's character Frank Stokes, 'You can wipe out an entire generation, you can burn their homes to the ground and somehow they'll still find their way back. But if you destroy their history, you destroy their achievements and it's as if they never existed. That's what Hitler wants and that's exactly what we are fighting for' the film concerns the gathering of a groups of arts oriented men to rescue art masterpieces from Nazi thieves following WW II and return them to their owners. It is based a true story The Monuments Men is 'an action drama focusing on an unlikely World War II platoon, tasked by FDR with going into Germany to rescue artistic masterpieces from Nazi thieves and returning them to their rightful owners. It would be an impossible mission: with the art trapped behind enemy lines, and with the German army under orders to destroy everything as the Reich fell, how could these guys - seven museum directors, curators, and art historians, all more familiar with Michelangelo than the M-1 - possibly hope to succeed? But as the Monuments Men, as they were called, found themselves in a race against time to avoid the destruction of 1000 years of culture, they would risk their lives to protect and defend mankind's greatest achievements.' The hoopla from Sony so states. <br/><br/>The cast includes George Clooney, Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Jean Dujardin, Bob Balaban and Hugh Bonneville as the disparate rescue squad. The best performance in the film is Cate Blanchett's well considered role as Clara Simone, the only one who seems to have an original idea in her mind. Dimitri Leonidas impresses in a small but significant role of a Jew who stays in company with the Monuments Men. It could have been written better and acted with more commitment, but as a movie it is good entertainment."

","Fascinating tale, great cast. Seriously one of the most interesting stories of WWII. And yet TMM is instantly forgettable. Why? Well, having spent some time thinking about its merits and faults I would say it points the camera and shoots in a way that disengages rather than involves and it doesn't really allow its actors to be more than predictable and above all the script is frankly, dull - it focuses when the viewer wants more scale, and diminishes the small stuff - it is frankly not good enough.<br/><br/>This combination of a very straight camera style, and lack of cinematography - lighting in particularly is very straightforward - with no sense of vision for the acting makes for a very decent, even noble, but dull film. It's fault is, honestly, it is mainly bland: bland camera, bland acting, and above all, bland script.<br/><br/>Only Cate Blanchett seems to bring some depth - everyone else has turned up and given their all but it doesn't translate. What we get is moderately exciting or interesting - and given the amazing story it really should be more.<br/><br/>One wished this film could have been as good as the plot deserves - it is certainly watchable - but it's not the film it could have been. As you can probably tell this viewer had been really looking forward to this one, and was monumentally disappointed."
"Allen_The-Shep_Shepherd","7","0","1","12 April 2014"," The Monuments Men Review
","My Thoughts: I have to start off with saying I did not really know what to expect from this movie when I went into it last night. It seems lately that Hollywood loves to do the ""based on a true story, but we are going to change that story to make it fit with our Hollywood endings and not really give you the historical aspect that you are probably really looking for."" Meaning, Hollywood doesn't think you can handle the real, true story, so they change it just enough to make it a happy movie.<br/><br/>I say that because The Monuments Men is that kind of movie in my opinion. While leaving the theater last night, there were mixed feelings about this movie. Overall, everyone seemed to enjoy it, though they didn't hate it or love it. Some of the comments overheard was that the pacing of the movie was slow, and they were not wrong. This is not your average, fast-paced, action-packed World War II movie. This movie takes the approach of giving you a high overview of what these ""Monument Men"" went through during the end of WWII, and it seems to be a bit jumpy as it moves from month to month, location to location. I understand why this happened, though; with this movie coming in at just under two hours, if they went any deeper into the happenings of the Monument Men, we would have to bring back the intermission from yesteryear. To me, this was not a problem; I understood there was just too much information and they had to give it to you in a way that wouldn't make you lose interest.<br/><br/>The second comment I heard was that it wasn't as dark as some people thought it could have been. What people are talking about is the atrocities we know that the Nazis committed against those they subjugated; specifically, the Jews. And I understand what the movie was trying to do here, or at least, I think I do. I do not believe that we need to focus on these atrocities in every WWII movie. What one should not forget while watching this movie is where all this art came from. Yes, some of it came from museums and churches, but a lot of it came from personal collections. The movie does give nods to this, but they do not slam it in your face, and I am fine with that. This movie was about them getting this art back and trying to return it to their rightful owners.<br/><br/>So what are we getting in this movie? We start off Frank Stokes (George Clooney) giving a briefing to the President, informing him that priceless artifacts are being destroyed and need to be protected. It seems that the President gives his approval to go ahead and form this squad of men, but they do not seem to want to put any power behind it. He will not give any young men this job due to the fact that they are all already overseas fighting the good fight, so Frank has to go around and recruit is older associates that are either too old for active duty or have some medical condition that kept them from joining. The other reason I say they did not get the support at the beginning of this mission is because of the ranks that they were given. Maybe this was better explained in the book, but I do not know. Frank and James Granger (Matt Damon) were given lieutenant ranks in the US Army and Jean Claude Clermont (Jean Dujardin) and Donald Jeffries (Hugh Bonneville) were given officer ranks in their respectful armies; everyone else was given enlisted rank. Now, the issue comes into play when an LT is telling a Colonel that he and his boys can't bomb, attack, or destroy something due to its historical value. One, the Colonel doesn't care about that; he wants to make sure his boys aren't put into harms way as much as he can. So, if the President was really behind this mission, he would have given Frank the rank of Colonel and made everyone else junior officers.<br/><br/>But we see the Monument Men going from one region to the next, trying to find out where the Germans are taking all this art. And let me tell you, I had heard that the Nazis stole art during WWII, but I had no idea how many pieces we were talking about. In the movie, at least, it looks like they had four to five mines plus a castle all full of art.<br/><br/>We also have the Germans who are stealing this art while they are retreating back to Germany. Oh, and do not forget the Nero Decree that Hitler put into effect. The Nero Decree was if Adolf Hitler was killed, everything was to be destroyed, including all the art that was being collected. We also have the Russians who have decided that for payment of all the deaths the Nazis caused in their country, that any art recovered will be sent back to the Motherland. So, the Monument Men's job doubles: find the stolen art and save what they can before the Russians find it.<br/><br/>My Recommendation: If you are looking for a different take on World War II, this is a good movie for you. For the rest that have a passing interesting or think the cast is great should wait till it comes out on DVD and Blu Ray."

","The Monuments Men - Directed by George Clooney. Starring Matt Damon, Cate Blanchett, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Hugh Bonneville and George Clooneys smile.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of George Clooneys trademark grin then this is the film for you. Good old George, his crooked smile has papered over the cracks of more screenplays than anyone in Hollywood history but on this occasion its just not enough.<br/><br/>""The Nazis are stealing precious art works Mr President!"" announces George.<br/><br/>""What can we do about?"" replies FDR.<br/><br/>""Put a team of character actors together to save them Mr President"" says George.<br/><br/>""Then get it done dammit! demands FDR.<br/><br/>George smiles.<br/><br/>So the team is thrown together in 60 seconds and we're in Europe to find stolen art pieces. We know little of the individuals, how they met, their motivations or their families although we find out one isn't happy being a private.....so George smiles.<br/><br/>From this point on the team members divide into pairs as they weave their way around France and southern Germany. Shots are fired, art is found, Nazis are bad, friends are lost and George smiles.<br/><br/>I got the impression I should have read the book before seeing the film....and perhaps Director Clooney shouldn't have. Clearly the real Monuments Men had a series of adventures throughout Europe while they tracked down stolen artworks and Director Clooney was determined to show us. Unfortunately he just didn't feel the need to string the events together with much of a plot making The Monuments Men feel like more of a skit show. But at least George smiles??? The co-stars weren't asked to do a lot or in the case of Bill Murray, anything. A comic genius of his quality and his role amounted to standing quietly and staring at the camera. If this was meant to be an accurate depiction of the real person then they could have just cast Harrison Ford and encouraged him to be himself. John Goodman, Hugh Bonneville and Matt Damon were competent but Director Clooney didn't ask them to do very much while George just smiled.<br/><br/>The shining light for the whole piece was Cate Blanchett as a French curator. She was highly convincing and played her part beautifully. Her dislike for the Nazis became contempt for the Americans. It took Damon a while to convince her of their motives and once he got her onside we learned more about her than any other character in the film. Interestingly this was achieved without George sharing the screen with Cate.... so it seems to me Director Clooney is better behind the camera when George isn't in front of it.....smiling."
"quincytheodore","5","0","1","25 March 2014"," Far less inspiring than it could have been, the good cast and intention are bogged down by poor screenplay.
","It has nice aspiration and strong cast, but the script just isn't up to par. A bit resembling Ocean franchise, George Clooney assembles a squad of intelligent men, not to steal valuable goods, but to preserve artworks from being destroyed at World War II. Contrary to usual war theme movie, The Monuments Men takes a lighter, more humorous view of the brotherhood and their cause. It works moderately in its own way with the interesting concept, although uneven pace, shallow screenplay and feeble dialogue confine the movie in mediocrity.<br/><br/>The story takes place in dusk of World War II, just as German was about to be defeated by Allied forces. Since the Nazi has confiscated a large amount of art from its occupation time, not to mention the war's toll on many other unprotected objects, Franks Stoke (George Clooney) inspires to save as many historic legacies as he can. The unit he established consists of museum curators, architects and historians, a very unorthodox squad by any means. In the casualty heavy struggle, their cause may seem trivial, and the movie tries to present this angle even though it may not rise in its fullest.<br/><br/>Cast is composed of famous line up, such as Matt Damon, Jean Dujardin, Cate Blanchett and more. Each contributes in their own way as one only has a couple of fervid scenes. Cate Blanchett delivers the most somber role of the somewhat light-hearted movie, she displays a cynical unyielding will and probably would fit in more intense direction. Bill Murray and John Goodman as veterans give a comedic side as they're aware they might not be soldier material, but they offer vivid reaction when faced with mortality. Jean Dujardin in the few scenes he's in manages to be suave and persistently spirited.<br/><br/>The most unfortunate thing is the screenplay doesn't allow the talented cast to reach their best potential. Dialogues sound tedious, stiff and frankly inauthentic. Pacing is monotonous, the unit splits into different teams and it's meant as an effort across the war torn Europe, but it never manages to create an intertwined flow. The pace feels fragmented as there's barely any consistency to string everything together. Its dramatic moments mostly seem dull and humor is unsuccessful at times.<br/><br/>There are some good scenes here, although they are brief and numbered in only a few stretched across the two hours movie. Ironically, the above average length can't form a compellingly structured plot because the content is sparsely divided the many characters. More than half of the movie is spent on comedy, sadly the jokes are stale, and they don't amount to much laughter or enjoyment. Aside from these short-lived moments of fascination, the movie is mundane.<br/><br/>The Monuments Men is based on cultural achievement, a good intention by George Clooney and it's presented in easily accessible fashion. However, the pace, direction and screenplay are subpar, making the movie muddled and far less inspiring than it could have been."

","Back behind the camera, American actor and ladies lover, G.Clooney, directs the unbelievable story of WWII platoon tasked to rescue art masterpieces from Nazi thieves and return them to their owners.<br/><br/>It must have been hard to find a new angle, a new point of view in order to display an original and mostly unknown exciting story. It could appeared as a legacy of Frankenheimer film's The Train (1964) but it was at that time still more focused on the French Resistance. It seems to me that Monuments Men is in the same genre as famous films such as The Dirty Dozen, Kelly's Heroes, Von Ryan's Express, The Longest Day, A Bridge too Far or even The Great Escape. All those masterpieces were epic films gathering a bunch of famous Cinema figures with suspense and humour. The Ocean's saga directed by Soderbergh works quite on the same concept. Monuments Men is highlighting a part of the WWII history. However its most important strength is that this films is not an Historical/Arts lesson or a boring documentary on the period and people. It finds the appropriate ton and pace right from the beginning. A sort of comic and non- solemnly ton. Plus, each one of the characters, apart from the team is interesting. They have their own identity. This film is build around more than Arts and War, it's build around character's back stories and how each one of them affected and helped the film to grow. Finally the question behind it is: Can you risk your life for a piece of Art? The film answer is clearly YES! Personally, I don't think that I will find myself running into a house on fire in order to save a painting someday. (A family member...yes... or my dog.) Monuments men is peculiar of Clooney's way of directing, Capra's idealist heir, who systematically search hope and redemption in Human nature. <br/><br/>Overall this film is engaging, entertaining and sentimental."
"ReeltalkwithLaura","4","0","1","17 March 2014"," Okay, but wanted more
","I went to see this movie a few weeks ago and have been thinking about writing this review. I was struck by a number of things and wanted to make sure I got it right when talking about it. So often we hear about war, the lives that are sacrificed and the horrible conditions, among other things. The picture that this film paints is very different from other war films. It's about what makes up people's history and culture: beautiful pieces of art work collected and preserved during World War II.<br/><br/>The film is based on a true story about a platoon that is tasked with rescuing art work that has been stolen by the German army at Hitler's demand. Seven men are given this task by FDR - to go behind enemy lines and find these treasures. The art work had been confiscated from museums to home collections, pieces that include the Mona Lisa, the Madonna and Child, and several other works of art. As the war is coming to a close these men must go into very dangerous places, knowing Hitler has given the order to destroy everything if something were to happen to him or if the Nazis lose the war. So they are running against the clock. <br/><br/>George Clooney, Matt Damon, Bill Murry, John Goodman. Jean, Dujardin, Hugh Bonneville, and Bob Balaban are the seven Monuments Men. They are in no way skilled military men, but rather museum directors, curators, and art historians. In order for them to be ""enlisted"" into the military they must attend basic training, and that in itself is hysterical. But these are men that love art and risk everything to get it back to the rightful owners. Cate Blanchett rounds out a very male driven cast, playing Clare Simon, a woman working in a office run by the German army but part of the resistance. <br/><br/>The screen play written by George Clooney and Grant Heslov (Argo) is decent; I would have enjoyed a little more character development. Were this supposed to be driven around the characters and the sacrifice they made, I am not completely invested in any of the characters.They are really one dimensional and to be honest don't leave any lasting impression. The acting is good, you would expect no less. Not a lot is shown of the German army / Nazis and when they are on screen they are portrayed more laughable then soldiers. This is a story that has a lot of heart and sacrifice that could have been told a little better. It's a movie worth seeing, just not in the theater."

","George Clooney directed this old-fashioned movie and starred in it looking like Clark Gable. Despite the negative reviews, there is nothing basically wrong with the movie. It tells a straight story, based on facts. It has a short introduction, where we get to meet all the main characters; a development, where we follow the different characters in their adventures and an end that wraps up the whole film.<br/><br/>Granted, today's audience, used to fast editing, special effects, gore and over the top scripts may find it difficult to appreciate what is really old school story-telling. However, some of the reviews I read here do not make any sense: somebody complained about ""lack of character development"", but they should know that in movies with a large cast, character development is hardly a priority.<br/><br/>Somebody else mentioned that it is ""absurd"" to leave gold and art in cave. Well, that actually happened for real, as the retiring Nazis could not carry all that stuff with them. Just check the historical records Other complained about ""yet another movie about WWII"". Perhaps they should check in advance which movies they are going to see, if they do not care about WWII movies.<br/><br/>I agree about the fact that given the premises it could have been a better movie, but I still found it entertaining.

There's simply too much going on to cram into two hours and the end result is a feeling that pieces of the tale are being skipped while others are rushed through.

It's like everyone is completely immune to getting excited about anything at all. Sad scenes don't convey sadness, happy scenes likewise do not convey happy emotions really, and all of the characters are one dimensional. The only exception is the performance of Kate Blanchett, who is subtly convincing as a french art scholar with insider info on what the Nazis did with the stolen art. Even still though, she seems unmoved by imminent possibility of death when an officer fires repeatedly at her and it just doesn't seem reasonable. Everyone's just too damned even tempered, patient and considerate about everything. No dramatic tension is created in the ensuing plot really, but one knows the story is real and huge in its full meaning.

","The Monuments Men, was arguably the most anticipated movie of 2013, and this was no surprise due to the star studded cast of George Clooney, Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Jean Dujardin, Bob Balaban, Hugh Bonneville, and Cate Blanchett. With George Clooney also directing and having part of writing the film, built up a lot of hype. However with it being the most anticipated film of 2013, I also believe it to be the most disappointing film of 2014... the script is hugely flawed, whilst it does somewhat keep the audience engaged with a few one-liners and witty character interactions, it leaves the characters to become hugely one dimensional. After leaving the cinema, I struggled to remember any of the character names and most of the characters themselves were easily forgotten. After watching the movie, wait an hour and you will see my point.<br/><br/>It seemed as though George Clooney had watched hours upon hours of World War 2 movies prior to directing this film for ideas to incorporate into Monuments Men, it's as though he saw cigarettes to be the biggest generic convention and packed Monuments Men absolutely full of smoking, turning it into a 2 hour cigarette advertisement. It is clear to me that George Clooney is not cut out for writing or directing. The film glorifies America's 'dominance' of the war with the only non Americans in the team dying not so far in. The two of whom were incredibly clichéd, with Jean Dujardin wearing a beret and scarf throughout. <br/><br/>As the team ventured across Europe, over various front lines, they experienced the most minimal of obstacles almost completely taking away the action aspect of the film which is so vital to a War genre film. Due to this, it became possibly the most simplest of heists ever portrayed, they even knew exactly where to look. This completely lost it's focus on the true story which became far from how it was portrayed by Clooney."

","The Monuments Men features an all-star cast and is directed by George Cloony. I felt as if the movie portrayed a great World War II story, but I think there was too much comedy for this type of movie. I enjoy good comedy movies, but I like a good serious war movie also. On a historical basis, it is basically spot on according to things I have read on the internet regarding the true story of the Monuments Men in World War II. I would not say it is an all-time great, but it is a good movie. It would be a good movie to see if you were taking your history class on a field trip because of the historical story and the is not a lot of language throughout the movie. I would not see the movie again, but I enjoyed it in theaters and suggest it for you."

","'THE MONUMENTS MEN': Three Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>George Clooney directed, co-wrote, co-produced and stars in this comedy-drama war flick about a group of soldiers, during World War II, who set out on a mission to retrieve stolen art masterpieces from Nazis. The film was also co-written and co-produced by Grant Heslov (a usual partner of Clooney's) and is based on the book 'The Monuments Men: Allied Heroes, Nazi Thieves and the Greatest Treasure Hunt in History' by Robert M. Edsel and Bret Witter. It features an all-star cast which also includes Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Jean Dujardin, Bob Balaban, Hugh Bonneville and Cate Blanchett. The movie is a bit of a mess, amusing at times but poorly put together by Clooney (who just can't seem to prove much talent as a director).<br/><br/>The story is loosely based on actual historical events and revolves around a team of soldiers (during World War II) who are assigned (by FDR) to rescue famous pieces of art from Hitler's army. Frank Stokes (Clooney) leads the unit (which is nicknamed 'Monuments Men') and puts together an odd group of art historians, museum directors and curators (who all know very little about actual combat). Stokes knows that the Nazis will destroy the stolen art and he thinks it's worth risking lives in order to preserve our culture. His platoon of friends agrees with him and they embark on the adventurous journey, into Germany, together.<br/><br/>The film raises an interesting question about whether preserving art and culture is worth the cost of lives or not. I think it's up to the person putting their life in jeopardy; people brave life-threatening dangers for all kinds of things that are important to them. So the message of the film might feel more meaningful to some viewers and more trivial (or even offensive) to others. It's funny that Matt Damon did also co-star in another World War II flick which raised the question of whether it's OK to risk multiple lives to save just one (in an attempt to relieve the grief of the soldier's mother); 'SAVING PRIVATE RYAN'. I do like the idea of the movie and what Clooney was attempting to do but he has a lot to learn about making a consistently solid film. The movie has good moments and decent performances but it's too all over the place to confidently recommend it. At times it does feel like part 'INDIANA JONES', part 'OCEAN'S ELEVEN' and part 'KELLY'S HEROES'. If a movie stitched together with all those different pieces sounds like fun to you you might really enjoy it!<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5TT6LZ7cFI"
"Laakbaar","6","0","1","22 February 2014"," Slow, cliché, unfocused, chauvinist
","Good points: Informative new angle about the war. Thought provoking.<br/><br/>Poignant and moving, at times. <br/><br/>The breathtaking depictions of all this great art. Wow.<br/><br/>Cate Blanchett's excellent performance. Matt Damon's smiling presence (despite being miscast). <br/><br/>The scene where Stahl is caught at his farm.<br/><br/>Bad points: Unfocused. Too many characters; too many scenes. Not much more than a series of vignettes, some of them cliché and trying a little too hard for audience appeal. Overreaching. <br/><br/>Lacking in nuance and subtlety. Approaching mawkishness at times.<br/><br/>I must have checked my watch five times during the film.<br/><br/>I thought almost everyone in the film was miscast (with the exception of Cate Blanchett). <br/><br/>Cliché. We've seen Omaha Beach many times. We have all long ago come to understand the evil of fascism and the Nazis. How many times have you seen a film showing inappropriate recruits attempt basic training? At least this time, they didn't show Bill Murray doing it.<br/><br/>It was as if the director was trying to tell the entire story of the Second World War (after D-Day). At times I thought the director was attempting an homage to the Second World War movie genre.<br/><br/>Too much stereotyping and chauvinism. To buy into this film, you have to believe (really believe) that art that fell into Nazi and Soviet hands was lost to humanity forever. I think it's fair to point out that the Germans and Russians are generally quite cultured, despite what this movie would seem to have you believe. Was this movie a little too overtly anti-German? Is civilisation in the hands of the Americans? <br/><br/>I see this film as an overly simplified and possibly unfaithful representation of historical events. But then most historical movies are like that. The theft of great art by a conquering power has always been part of European history. (Thankfully this movie hints at this.) <br/><br/>The movie posits a balance between saving great art and saving human lives, but in truth, it was never one or the other. <br/><br/>George, you've played in, and made, some great movies, but something went wrong with this one. It didn't work for me, however I do feel we need films like this to remind us: never again."

","expected a lot from this movie,but was disappointed.it needed to be intense as the happenings were of ww-2,but it lacked the intensity throughout.it's full of one-liners which just most of the times spoiled the importance of the scene.sorry to say George Clooney but it was a great story gone wasted just because of the amount of humour stuffed in it.we don't expect ourselves to laugh while watching a movie based on ww-2.it could have easily been one of the most memorable movie of the year,but it is now a movie which I would like to forget.the acting by all the actors was decent.the story however lacked the essence of the story it was meant to present."
"IainMcDougall3","Null","0","2","18 February 2014"," Monumental failure
","The film opens with the coming together of the seven monument men, it was a little akin to the start of the 'Magnificent Seven'. The big difference was instead of the muscular physique of Bronson or the cool Chic of McQueen, you get John Goodman & Bill Murray. I was so disappointed with this slushy effort by Clooney & co. I decided to watch this movie because of my fondness for the work of Murray & Kate Blanchett. Bill Murray was much under-used in this supposed comedy,and I'm very surprised that Kate Blanchett would appear in such a half-baked effort. Her accent reminded me of Yvette in 'Allo 'Allo, I was waiting for Rene to appear from ze café !! I've come to the conclusion that Jean Dujardin should stick to silent movies. This selection of ageing characters are tasked with saving precious works of art from the Nazis as they retreated through France & Belgium. This is neither drama or comedy, I would find it difficult to put this picture into any genre or persuade anybody to sit through it. That's two hours of my life that I'll never get back."
"lark40","7","0","1","17 February 2014"," weird odd true story
","I heard this film got only 33 on rotten tomatoes I don't know why as its a funny odd story that had to be told because the nature of which its told in. George Clooney does a great job at directing and acting the man is talented by getting a great cast bill Murray I don't normally like him because he normally serious he was underused here but his scenes are fun . Matt Damon went behind enemy lines in saving private Ryan in Belgium its funny he goes back there to find art the whole film is odd like a carry on film but the scenes in the film thee is lots of emotion to the story the normally soldiers didn't take these guys serious enough but they had saved billions in arts and monuments and treasures all over Belgium and France and saved it from Hitler for his own private collection I gave this film 7/10"
"bkrauser-81-311064","6","0","2","13 February 2014"," Monuments Men Stands Still
","The movie opens with Metropolitan Museum of Art curator Frank Stokes (Clooney) pleading with President Roosevelt to protect Europe's cultural heritage by forming the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives Program, nicknamed the Monuments Men. After he receives the go-ahead he recruits a gaggle of art professionals including art historians (Matt Damon, Hugh Bonneville), architects (Bill Murray), sculptors (John Goodman) and other artists (Jean Dujardin & Bob Balaban). Their mission: to find caches of stolen art and rescue them from the pilfering Nazis.<br/><br/>Costarring Cate Blanchett as art curator for the occupied Paris Museum, Monuments Men tries to be a mixture of Guns of Navarone (1961), Topkapi (1964) and National Treasure (2004) but fails on all counts. From the get go the film plods through the plot like it has no particular place to go. The principle cast is given little opportunity to flesh out their characters with only Damon given the opportunity to really let loose. Yet even his wings are clipped by an uninteresting courtship with Blanchett's character which seems tagged on because, you know, without Blanchett it'd be a sausage-fest.<br/><br/>Part of the fault lies with George Clooney who in addition to starring also directed. His direction is adequate but far from commanding keeping everything mid-range, eye-level, and simply blocked. His style has never seemed to grow since Confessions of a Dangerous Mind (2002) and while his by-the-books camera-work might work for Good Night, and Good Luck (2005) it simply can't for a retread of The Train (1964). Word of advice, if you're trying to recreate the grandeur of old Hollywood in your films, don't use the same techniques, put your own stamp on it.<br/><br/>Of course the film is not all bad. Art students might enjoy playing a game of find the Vermeer instead of paying attention to Clooney's pronouncements of importance. There are a handful of funny moments for those who haven't seen the trailers. There's a running gag with people continually complaining about Damon's bad French which is amusing. Also Murray and Balaban's characters do make a good team in a Bob Hope, Bing Crosby kind of way. If the movie consisted of just them and Blanchett's capable yet under-appreciated Parisian dame, I might be okay with that.<br/><br/>If Monuments Men were placed in a WWII four pack with Red Tails (2012), Enemy at the Gates (2001) and Defiance (2008) I might buy it (though the draw would be Enemy at the Gates). The film succeeds in telling the story of the MFAA without being too cloying or discourteous. But after the credits roll and the house lights come up you might be wishing the film was more interesting."
"danlipsher","6","0","1","13 February 2014"," Decent acting, so-so script
","Great acting but a so-so script: Nazis bad, Allies good, Frenchy and Brit die in the second reel. Clooney and Damon are good-looking, I get that. (But Bill Murray and character actor Bob Balaban steal the show.) Before the war my family held Europe's greatest collection of Dogs Playing Poker, so I know the story. And apparently in real life Göring couldn't tell a real Vermeer from a fake. Woman sitting behind me was shocked, SHOCKED when the Good Guys were elbow-deep in gold fillings, like she had no idea about Josef Mengele's dental fixation. Come on, that's Holocaust 101. I'd hate to be the one to tell her that something happened to President Kennedy."
