"Rockford_6","6","65","89","4 September 2008"," Good action, but bad plot
","I knew going into this movie that it was going to be easy viewing, but I thought it would have more of a plot. Sure, the action scenes are great in that classic John Woo, ultra-choreographed way, but the plot isn't original or have much to it. Dougray Scott tries as the villain, but he's not scary at all, just sort of mildly irritable. After all, this is a villain who demands stock options as part of his bounty. (Truly, a sign of the times, and the audience laughed at that one.) Thandie Newton, who I had never seen before, is certainly beautiful, but she carries two expressions on her face through the entire movie, and resembles Ally McBeal in a tighter T-shirt. And then there's Tom. His character is more of a James Bond clone than the character is the original movie; I admire his guts and fearlessness for doing several scenes (especially the opening one), and the truth is, he's not bad. This just could have been much more. I did like Anthony Hopkins, though. He brings class to whatever he appears in."
"theshadow908","6","111","160","3 May 2006"," Totally different style.
","Mission: Impossible was a fast paced espionage thriller that actually made you think, which is what I like in a movie. Since John Woo, who is one of the kings of the action genre, took over for Brian De Palma, you can expect Mission: Impossible II to be an intense action movie with a majorly dumbed down plot. Everything to do with the plot is laid out for us basically right away. Now, all there is to do is sit back and watch those classic John Woo action sequences. In this movie, Ethan Hunt is once again a secret agent, and he is sent on a mission to stop a crooked agent from stealing a deadly virus for his own use.<br/><br/>I liked the first Mission: Impossible better because it had a more advanced plot. This Mission: Impossible is just a bland shoot 'em up action film. Now there's nothing wrong with that. The movie was still immensely entertaining. It just didn't fit in with the first film. Even the character of Ethan Hunt, though still played by Tom Cruise, is different. In this movie he doesn't seem as serious about his job. He's more cocky. However, I do like that the character now has absolutely amazing skills in hand to hand combat.<br/><br/>Overall, if you're looking for a smart spy thriller like the first film, this ain't it. If you're looking for a fun action film with amazing action sequences, this is it.<br/><br/>6.5/10"
"miriamlaufey","1","118","176","8 May 2006"," The awfulness is amazing
","Wow. I've seen lots of bad movies and lots of bad sequels, but this one was just incredibly bad. I didn't even know it was possible to sink that low. And it wasn't even bad in a funny way, but simply bad in an extremely painful way. I don't even know why I watched it to the end.<br/><br/>The story is nothing but a series of clichés. The bad guys have stolen a killer virus and are intending to let it loose to make a fortune selling the antidote. Very predictable, eh? The characters couldn't be more two-dimensional if they were in a Nintendo game. Being a tomboy, I absolutely hate it when women in movies have no personality and are just added in as a love interest. Nyah, the chick in MI2, is a perfect example of this. She was the only female in the entire film and her sole purpose was to be sexy (as is subtly shown by several pointless cleavage shots). Sure, the movie wants you to think that she could kick ass if she wanted to by making her a professional thief, but isn't very convincing at that. In the end, while Tom Cruise is engaged in a very unrealistic battle sequence on a beach, she roams around aimlessly, considering the possibility of throwing herself off a cliff (which would have been a relief).<br/><br/>I was going to talk about the extremely pointless car chase sequence between the hero and the chick, in which they demolish their cars for no reason whatsoever, but I don't really know what to say about it.<br/><br/>The only good thing about this film is that it was so boring that I preferred doing the homework I'd been postponing for ages to watching the dumb motorcycle chases."
"barrytwomey-1","1","60","87","25 August 2007"," I blame John Woo for this one
","Well, this was a pretty poor excuse for a movie. I liked the first and third but the second was awful. You would know John Woo was involved by the inclusion of doves flying through the under ground lair shortly after an explosion! I just don't get the dove thing.<br/><br/>It is a pretty straight forward, brain at the door action movie but the real problem with it is the huge inconsistencies throughout the movie. OK, the acting is a bit crappy, there's the token love interest and everything else is pretty forgettable but its an action movie, thats their nature sometimes.<br/><br/>The 'chase' scenes are awful to be fair to them, especially the motorbike one. How is it that his bike doesn't explode when his gas tank is hit but everything he shoots blows up? How can a bullet fired almost directly at you shatter the visor on the bike and not hit the passenger? Then to top it all off before duelling with there bikes on the sand, the high performance road bikes take an off camera pit-stop to change the slick tires to off-road. This brief rant illustrates the stream of flaws through the movie and I think Mr. Woo should be accountable. Tut tut John. If you want action try somewhere else because this will leave you under whelmed. Try number III, its not all bad."
"Anonymous_Maxine","7","30","42","29 May 2000"," M:I 2 definitely delivers as far as hard-core action, but some elements were excessive to the point of being cartoonish.
","Ethan Hunt is back with another theoretically impossible mission. Tom Cruise once again delivered at least a satisfactory performance, along with all other actors involved, but John Woo's direction was a little bit excessive at some points. I fail to see what made it necessary for Hunt to be riding his motorcycle on the front wheel while firing at an oncoming car. Or how about that gun that was lying in the sand toward the end of the film? Was that a little too unrealistic, or was it just me?<br/><br/>The story was good, the acting was convincing enough, and the action sequences were well put together, but they were just too much. One of the other things that really saved this film from action-packed obscurity was some very clever and well placed dialogue, particularly on the part of Ving Rhames, back once again as Luther Stickell (""Ethan! Nyah is in the building! Do you copy!"")<br/><br/>Despite M:I 2's shortcoming's, it will undoubtedly be very satisfying to the true action fan. It has explosions, gun fights, car chases, lethal viruses, Jackie Chan style fight scenes, and even a hint of a few WWF moves in those fights. Mission: Impossible 2 is a good action film. I was not tremendously impressed, but I also didn't feel like I had just wasted two hours. Go watch the movie, just don't expect it to be the phenomenal gift from the action movie gods that it was made out to be."

","IMF Agent Ethan Hunt is sent on a seemingly impossible mission to capture a destroy the only existing supply of a deadly disease known as Chimera. However a group of terrorists, led by ex-IMF agent Ambrose also want the disease so that they can us it to infect the world as they have already got the only cure.  Hunt turns to jewel thief Nyah to help him by infiltrating her ex-lover's (Ambrose) group to spy on them.<br/><br/>John Woo must have thought of the elements he needed to follow up the solid thrills of the original movie.  Big action scenes? Yes.  Slow-motion? Yes. Plot?  Characters?  Good theme music?  Logic of any kind?  Nope  won't be needing those!  Or at least that's how it felt.  The plot of the first film was clever despite being open to holes  the plot here makes the first one look like a watertight piece of genius!  The story only really serves to set up action scenes and the like  I can barely remember the disease and can only recall rubbish action scenes!<br/><br/>For a director like John Woo I knew to expect slow-mo and OTT action, but I didn't know that it would all be so very superficial and weak.  For example the car chase where Hunt and Nyah meet is just ridiculous and very annoying. The robbery of the disease is a pale shadow of the original film's robbery scene and the final motorbike chase is good but only a hint of what Woo has done before.  The plot overuses the whole `face mask' thing  it must do it about 8 or 9 times  many of those time's there's no way Hunt could have made a mask of the people involved!  It's another example of how silly it is.<br/><br/>While Cruise was cool in the first film, here he is slick and tough  an image that doesn't work.  He was much better in the first film.  Scott is non-existent as a villain and is pretty dull.  Newton is sexy but no more than that.  Rhames is good and Hopkins has an enjoyable minor role.<br/><br/>Overall this film is an OTT mess.  The plot is a shambles and the action scenes are silly and often have no logical reason behind them!  The overuse of the face masks just points to the total lack of a good script and Woo's slow motion just feels tired and unimaginative.  Only the final action scene is enjoyable, but by then you're ony interesting in turning this off and watching De Palma's much better film instead."

","I really liked 1996's 'Mission: Impossible'. Now here is the antithesis of the first movie: 'Mission: Impossible II'. The first film was a tight, smooth thriller that barreled along at warp speed, and was a nice break from conventional Hollywood action thrillers. 'II' pretty much IS a conventional Hollywood thriller.<br/><br/>Almost nothing from the first film has been picked up here: Tom Cruise? Yes, he's back, but he's not a spy anymore. He's James Bond, minus ANY cool gadgets or charisma. The awesome theme music? Gone, replaced with a horrible rock score. The action is typical Hollywood: Slow-motion gunplay and martial arts.<br/><br/>Ugh, I hate this movie! The acting and dialogue is lame, the techno-rock score even lamer, and the action scenes are mundane. Here's hoping 'MI: III' won't be as cringe-inducing as this disaster."

"No 6","1","103","184","25 July 2001"," Simply the worst film ever made (Contains Spoilers!!!)
","I thoroughly enjoyed the first Mission Impossible. It was probably the only film that puts you into the mind of a secret agent as he tries to uncover a conspiracy that wiped out his cohorts. It had excellent twists, who would have thought that the hero of the TV series (Jim Phelps) finally turns into the bad guy.<br/><br/>The sequel however has no plot, no interesting dialogue just mindless shootouts that would leave Gun and ballistic experts laughing in disbelief. John Woo is not a director he is a second unit director that got lucky. He cannot control his cast, he cannot convey any plot and he cannot stage believable action sequences.<br/><br/>Woo seems to be directing (if you could call it that) in his sleep. The storyline seems to slightly mirror the original film in that a member of IMF goes rogue (not another one!!) and tries to release a Killer Virus called Chimaera on an unsuspecting world.<br/><br/>Apparently IMF Boss (Anthony Hopkins) knows the whereabouts of the Villain's hideout and orders Ethan Hunt to plant the Bad Guy's Ex girlfriend in an attempt to undermine him. (Wouldn't it have been better if they just attacked the HQ with commandos etc)<br/><br/>In the original film Ethan Hunt gets promoted to Jim Phelps rank within the organisation but in the sequel he is still a ""Point man"" jumping around in commando gear. Ving Rhames and his Australian colleague seem to do absolutely nothing in this film other than occassionally tap on a computer laptop keyboard and try to look serious. By removing the ""team"" element that made the series so great it makes the whole thing look like James Bond rather than Mission Impossible.<br/><br/>An interesting point to note is that since we know that Jim Phelp's salary was 60K PA There is no way the Rogue IMF grunt in this film could afford a massive private army along with a beach front Condo.<br/><br/>Some other laughable points in this film include:<br/><br/>The painstaking attempt by Hunt to infiltrate a building by bungee jumping down a giant ventilator shaft while the Rogue IMF villain and his private army gingerly stroll through the front door of said building.<br/><br/>The IMF villain must be unbelievably dumb to initiate a shootout (including explosions) with Ethan Hunt in a deadly Virus/Chemical research lab.<br/><br/>The Second Unit Director's (Woo) laughable obsession with White Doves that seem to have more screen time than Anthony Hopkins.<br/><br/>The throat elastoplast that enables people to talk like other people including perfecting their accents (South African, Scottish, American)<br/><br/>And finally the car and motorcycle chases that seem to break the laws of physics rather than breaking the monotony of the plot.<br/><br/>It is hard to believe that it took four years of rewrites and production/ shooting to create this sorry mess. Even the soundtrack by Metallica and Limp Bizkit is absolutely Tuneless and irrelevant to the film.<br/><br/>Although it made an impressive opening weekend this film got so slated by critics and the media that it would be lucky to break even from box office takings. So do not expect an MI3 so quickly.<br/><br/>This movie will have the distinction of earning a Golden Turkey award."
"toolate8","1","33","54","15 May 2006"," All gunfire and no substance!
","Mission impossible II is undoubtedly one of the ten worst movies ever made; with the exception of the climbing sequence, at the beginning of the film, it is completely without excitement or any other merit. The endless stream of explosions and gunfire is a poor substitute for a plot or for interesting and engaging characterization; this is not an action movie, it is more like a small-town fireworks display. <br/><br/>The female lead comes across as having as much personality as a sack of wet fish; what little she does say is delivered with all of the emotion and enthusiasm of a fast-food order. <br/><br/>Mr. Cruise is a competent actor; however, you would never know it from this film--nobody would have been able to deliver a compelling performance, considering the insipid dialog, abysmal writing and first-year film-school-caliber direction, in this mess. The gimmick, with the masks IS cute and would be a nice addition to a movie, which contained some real intrigue, however when it is as over-used, as in this film, it is only silly.<br/><br/>There should be a secure institution, located far away from Hollywood, where untalented writers and self-indulgent directors, like the fools who created this garbage, can be locked up and kept from bothering the public with this kind of silliness."

"TheNorthernMonkee","1","38","66","9 September 2005"," diabolical MTV farce
","SPOILERS Way back in the 1960s a wonderful television series was released called ""Mission Impossible"". With a legendary theme tune and some great stories, the series was followed by an equally superb film in 1996. Entertaining and well shot, it was only a matter of time before star Tom Cruise would find himself reprising the role of Ethan Hunt. It's a disastrous fact therefore that this sequel is an abomination. More like a badly shot MTV movie, it is badly acted, written and contains some of the worst film fight scenes of all time.<br/><br/>After Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) steals a manufactured disease, it is up to fellow secret agent Ethan Hunt (Cruise) to retrieve it. Adding Ambrose's former love Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton) to the mix, and the film descends into a mediocre action packed love triangle.<br/><br/>From the opening scenes of Tom Cruise climbing up a cliff without protective ropes, you can tell that this film is going to be awful. When he begins to fall in love with Thandie Newton's dire Nyah, you're suspicions are confirmed.<br/><br/>Finally, let's progress to the ending and look at the absolutely diabolical final fight scene. It's never a good idea to analyse the ending of a film, but on this occasion, the terrible motorbike and hand to hand combat events at the end need to be talked about.<br/><br/>The bike scene is awful. Put simply it is a pointless, irrelevant battle which collapses in on itself. Following that, the combat scene between Cruise and Scott is a farce. Set to your typical MTV soundtrack and with ""Mortal Kombat"" style fighting (including the rudimentary slow motion death), the whole scene is a joke with absolute no merit.<br/><br/>It feels only fair to try to find a positive side to this film. In that respect the character of Hugh Stamp, played by Richard Roxburgh, is the rare highlight of this awful film. Funny and entertaining, the character is a surprising joy. It's a small positive in an otherwise major mistake.<br/><br/>With a feel of an MTV video, ""Mission Impossible II"" is an enormous mistake. Badly written, acted and shot, it is one of the worst films in living memory. Even the brief joy of Richard Roxburgh's Hugh can't save the film from failing badly. A dire movie worth avoiding at all costs."

"brando647","4","5","6","23 January 2016"," Two Mind-Numbing Hours of Slow Motion and Explosions
","I hadn't seen this movie in years and, with all the ROGUE NATION excitement last year, I sat down and revisited MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 2. I'd seen it in theaters back in the summer of 2000 and I vaguely remember enjoying it, but not as much as the first film. Watching it again more than a decade later, I see just how lame it really is. As a fan of the series who's excited to see it doing so well now that we're five movies in, I was disappointed to go back to MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 2 and find myself bored out of my mind. It's a prime example of throwaway entertainment. The action is dull, the characters are bland, and the stakes never feel important. Directed by action maestro John Woo, the focus is on style while plot and characters take a distant backseat. In his second big screen mission, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is assigned to retrieve a genetically modified form of influenza that kills its victim within 24 hours. It (and the matching antivirus) was stolen by fellow IMF agent Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) who's gone rogue and plans to use it to embezzle money from the corrupt owner of the company that created it. Part of that plan is, of course, to release it on the unsuspecting public and reap profits while innocents die. To get the inside scoop on Ambrose's plans, Hunt recruits the man's former lover, Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton) to reignite their relationship and report her findings to Hunt and the IMF.<br/><br/>I honestly can't believe Roger Ebert gave this movie a positive review<br/><br/>Geez, where to begin? I guess the action and John Woo's ""style"". From the little bit of his work I've seen (i.e. a few of his American projects), I'm just not a fan. He can certainly craft an intense action scene but he's also got a lot of trademark visuals that he uses to nauseating extremes here. No, not his doves. The dove doesn't appear to the very end of the film. The slow motion. So much slow motion. It's used everywhere in this movie and all the time. Eyes meeting across a room? Slow motion. Eyes meeting between drivers in a high-speed chase? Slow motion. Walking? Slow motion. Jumping? Slow motion. Slow motion? Slow motion. Run this film at normal speed and you could probably fit it as a one-hour M:I television special with commercials. And then there's the gratuitous use of explosions. I love a good movie explosion as long as it's motivated. In MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 2, if a car so much as hits a speed bump too fast it's liable to explode in a blaze of glory. Personally, vehicle crashes are more interesting without the explosion because you get a better view of the impact, rather than another identical (improbable) fireball. MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: 2 is first and foremost an action film, but when the bullet wounds are bloodless and vehicles explode for seemingly no reason it feels cheap and pandering like toilet humor in non- funny comedies.<br/><br/>It all made sense when I was watching a promotional puff-piece for the film and writer Robert Towne explained that he was approached with a series of action set-pieces designed by Woo and Cruise. He was asked to write the script around the action. As a result, we wind up with a weak story of Ethan Hunt and his team chasing a vaguely-threatening MacGuffin and a forgettable villain. I don't know much about IMF operations and hiring practices but you'd think someone would've noticed Ambrose was getting ready to go full-blown villain. As much as an IMF agent is expected to endure in the course of their job, you'd think they'd have team psychologist to check in on them and maybe realize that they had a psychopath in the field. Ambrose falls far short of being an awesome antagonist on the level of Jon Voight in the first film or Philip Seymour Hoffman in the third. We know nothing of his motivations other than he wants to be rich and he has zero qualms about killing entire populations to do so. To get at Ambrose, Hunt is forced to recruit Nyah and use her as bait. WhichOKbut once Ambrose's location was discovered, why not pull Nyah out and go all IMF on his base of operations? Isn't that their job? Instead, she gets to play spy, putting her civilian life in danger to report information that Hunt could've obtained with one of his crazy awesome IMF infiltration missions.<br/><br/>So many complaintswhat can I say positively about MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 2? Tom Cruise continues to be awesome as Ethan Hunt. I love the work he's done in this franchise and the fact that he insists on doing his own stunts is impressive. The opening with Hunt free-climbing is that much more intense because we can see it's Cruise on the side of that rocky cliff-face. Ving Rhames is always a cool presence, even if his character is one-note in his fashion obsession this time around. And the M:I theme got a nice rock upgrade for this film. Still, you're better off skipping this one and moving on to MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 3."

","No matter how you feel about Jim Carry you should thank him for making the Grinch, because up until that came out M:I2 had been the highest grossing movie of 2000. Which would have been quite awful way to begin the new millennium. Or end the last one, depending on how annoying you are about that issue. Do not see this movie even if Tom Cruise rings your doorbell and threatens to wave his long hair in slow motion as he did so often in film if you don't view it. It has absolutely no redeeming qualities about it at all. The tape inside the film's video cassette is to thick to use as dental floss, To long to work as a belt. Also This movie is not only awful, it is a total knock off of Notorious by the incredible director Alfred Hitchcock. The following parts of Notorious were completely stolen and screwed up by Tom: Cary Grant and Ingrid meeting at the race track and her boy friend becoming suspicious of them. Cary seducing  Bergman and then using her in his spy work. Ingrid having to go under cover and marry the bad guy, who is in love with her. Tom, if your going to make a movie that sucks, please don't try and tarnish a perfectly good Hitchcock in the process."

","Now, let me get one thing straight. This is NOT a smart film. It's not intended to be. It has its moments of comedy, a romance, and a lot of great action scenes. Might I also add that the score is AMAZING? The part where Nyah injects herself and says ""You're not going to kill this bitch,"" to Sean is literally on-the-edge-of-your-seat good. The music during this scene is so beautiful, I literally watched this part over like 25 times! Like I said before, this film is not intended to be a smart, twisty thriller like the first one was. It is simply an action movie that is intended to get your heart pumping, and the twists that the first movie had are replaced with beautiful music and great action. Enjoy it for that.<br/><br/>Cast-wise, I thought Thandie Newton was fantastic. Her face conveys so many emotions and her voice is so addictive. Tom is great as usual and Dougray Scott is a perfect villain. Smart, witty, and dangerous, but not too menacing.<br/><br/>Overall, I think this was the best of the entire series. MI1 was too confusing and not really that exciting, MI3 was kind of random (Phillip Seymour Hoffman is NOT a good villain, I just can't take him seriously!), and MI Ghost Protocol was great too, I just like this one better.<br/><br/>9/10"

","Hey, Tom Cruise.  If you are reading this comment, I want to tell you that your recent movie ""Mission Impossible 2"" STINKS.  Tom, you and your sidekick John Woo (who is reputed to be a very competent director) seem to lack any common sense.  In this movie, your character, Ethan Hunt, is virtually Superman himself.  He can shoot from a moving motorcycle and hit a target without any problem whatsoever.  He is a martial arts expert, better than Bruce Lee, Chuck Norris and Jean-Claude Van Damme combined.  He is a great lady-killer, better than Casanova, Don Juan or James Bond. I was amazed that he did not fire laser beams from his eyes.  Ethan nonchalantly does super dangerous things just for the heck of it and succeeds without any problem whatsoever.  Tom, let me teach you common sense.  When a character is so absolutely perfect and super-duper cool, the character becomes very boring and tiring.  Moreover, after Ethan repeatedly puts himself in danger for no rational reason (maybe just for the fun of it), I became sick and tired of his self-indulgent, childish antics.  <br/><br/>Even worse, Tom, why did this movie focus so much on your character?  It looked as if your character dominated all the major scenes in the movie.   I saw you so much in the movie that I couldn't stand seeing your face anymore. Tom, don't you know that the fun of any drama--be it a film or TV show--is in watching the interactions of different characters?  There is nothing more boring than looking at one face and listening to one person for hours and hours.  Moreover, because I saw you so much in this movie, I know what kind of person you are.  Your ego is so puffed up that you wanted yourself and nobody else to be acting in this film.  That is, you wanted all the other actors, even greats like Anthony Hopkins and Ving Rhames, to be insignificant bit players.  <br/><br/>I remember the old TV series ""Mission Impossible.""  Using the name ""Mission Impossible"" as the title of this film is a total rip-off.  Your movie ""MI 2"" is ""Mission Impossible"" in name only.  Your movie has no relationship whatsoever to the TV series.  ""MI 2"" does not have the careful planning or the finesse of the TV series.  It is just one long self-indulgence to satisfy your own narcissism.  Many critics accuse your friend Sylvester Stallone of making narcissistic movies.  But compared to you, he is a paragon of modesty.  Tom, you are a peerless narcissist.  In the future, if you want to admire yourself, please do it in front of your own bathroom mirror.  Please do not make a movie for the sole purpose of indulging in self-admiration.  Your ex-wife, Nicole Kidman, once remarked that you love nobody but yourself.  Judging from the narcissism of ""MI 2,"" you must be madly in love with yourself."
"rogue7-2","Null","10","16","13 January 2001"," A perfect example of what's wrong with action movies today.
","SPOILER WARNING What's wrong with this movie?  Where do I begin? Let's start with the fact that the storyline is a direct rip-off of Hitchcock's ""Notorious"".  You have a beautiful woman being recruited to gain the confidence of a past love, a quick romance between our hero and heroine, a search for a deadly secret, and her life hanging in the balance. Hitchcock did it first and did it best.<br/><br/>Then there's the fact that John Woo has outlived his usefulness as a ""cutting edge"" director.  He's overused his trademarks to the point where they've have become old and cliche.  The slow motion shots have lost their effectiveness and the doves are just downright annoying.<br/><br/>And lastly, he has taken the concept of suspension of disbelief to new lows. Moviegoers today are educated enough to know that when they see an action movie, they're going to see unbelievable action sequences and unrealistic plot twists.  John Woo treated the audiences of this movie as brain-dead 13 year old boys.  Only adolescent males could have enjoyed the overdone slow motion, the guns that never run out of ammunition, the overwrought face masks, and the impossible reverse wheelies with the motorcycles.<br/><br/>In other words, if you're an prepubescent pyromaniac who believes everything you see, you'll love it.  For the rest of us, I would recommend a road trip with your in-laws over this complete waste of time."

For Woo, it's an intriguing starting point to play with his action figures, including Tom Cruise, the world's most popular G.I. Joe, surrounded by a remarkable cast. Luscious visuals with sharp colour palettes, balletic fights and a masterful homage to another auteur like Michael Mann are reasons enough to enjoy MI2.<br/><br/>The Mission Impossible series remains one of the most interesting sagas still unfolding - not for its narrative arc, which is flimsy at best, but for the triumph of gorgeous set pieces, each time with a different master action director at the helm.<br/><br/>7/10"
"guybrush105","4","4","5","9 July 2000"," How about doing some research before making a movie?
","I'm a big DePalma fan and I loved the first Mission Impossible despite what the critics and Jay Leno may say. The plot wasn't that hard to follow, the acting was great and Tom Cruise played a vulnerable though smart and resourceful agent named Ethan Hunt. He was involved in this huge mission with expert secret agents that weren't any worse than him, with the exception that they weren't the main characters and therefore the movie didn't focus on them that much. However, MI:2 or whatever you wanna call it is some bad spy flick which doesn't have anything to do neither with the first movie nor with the TV series. Ethan Hunt must be dead or something because the character Cruise plays only shares the name in common, for he's a completely different person. (Since when does a self-effacing character like him kill all the bad guys himself and work alone? All Ving Rhames and the other guy do is shoot from a helicopter. And now comes my biggest complaint. I'm Spanish and I've lived in Spain my whole life, so I do know what this country is like. I recall a James Bond movie with Roger Moore in which he goes to Madrid, which was nothing but a bunch of white houses with Mexicans (who must be fed up with Hollywood mistaking their country with the utterly different and boring Spain) leaning back against the walls and some ancient bus with a sign on it which said ""Madrid"", as if it was the only bus there was in the city. Apart from that film there are many other American movies which depict Spain as some third-world country full of South Americans, whom I respect a lot but who don't have absolutely anything to do with Spanish people. But these were all old movies and I thought Hollywood had learnt to do some research before setting a movie in a foreign country. I was, however, wrong. The first few minutes (after the climbing scene) take place in Seville which looks nothing like that kind of a Mexican ""Hacienda"" we see there. Sevilla is a city, and it looks just like Paris, Vienna or Rome. People wear regular clothes, they don't go around dressed up in those weird outfits shown in the movie which aren't even Spanish. (Some of them are, though, but from a different part of Spain)<br/><br/>  I remember Anthony Hopkins saying that locals burn their saints as he looks out the window and watches some weird ritual which is supposed to be a ""national Spanish feast"". Then we see people dressed in real regional Sevillan costumes (but they're just regional though, people don't wear them on the streets, it's like those green costumes Austrians have), people dressed also in regional Valencian costumes (which would never be found at a Sevillan feast, since they come from up North) and some other folks wearing dressed that come directly from the imagination of the costume designers. Then we see them burning wooden statues of saints in a huge fire in the middle of a square, and they all move around like zombies. That doesn't exist!! People don't burn saints in Spain, and they don't walk around as if they were possessed by the devil. And the worst thing is that it's supposed to be a religious feast. Don't worry foreigners!! We don't do that, we're normal people just like you, that wear the same clothes as you do, live in buildings just like you and probably think like you!!!<br/><br/>  Maybe the thing of the fire comes from a non-religious feast that takes place in Valencia every year where people light fire-crackers just for fun and there are spectacular fire-works. But it's just a show, that's all. Something for the tourists.<br/><br/>  Then I was also surprised to see the supposedly locals speak with a strong South American accent with a touch of Arabic (Two beautiful accents that don't have anything to do with the Spanish one, and besides Arabic is a different language)and also not a single blonde or white skinned person. Hey, people in Spain are blonde, red-haired, brunette, etc. I myself am blonde. And we aren't dark-skinned (even though we try hard to be, since it's very sexy and fashionable skin color. To top it off, some of the sentences in Spanish the locals said weren't even right!!<br/><br/>
  Besides these comments on my country, I have to say some of the action scenes (like when Cruise goes into that building tied by a rope suspended from an helicopter) are great but the movie is nothing but non-sense and it's not ""Mission impossible"" at all. And I wanted Ving Rhames and the other guy to do more stuff, let alone the girl, whose being a professional thief doesn't seem to help her at all. Mr. DePalma, please come back!!"

","This movie I saw too many times and never get sick of it. Out of all the mission impossibles this i =s my favorite one, and tell you why. Let's start by the director John Woo who made action epics like Hard boiled, The Killer, Face/off,Hard Target and Red Cliff. This guy has a way of making action films seem more beautiful with the doves slow-motion . The soundtrack of this movie is by far the best out the entire series and Hans Zimmer did a great job mixing rock tunes that fit best for the scenes. The action sequences in here are pretty impressive for it's time, and consists of using stuntmen/Tom Cruise. I doesn't slow down for a bit and even if it does the story will keep you gripped. When I first saw this movie when I was a little kid back in 2002 and I was so amazed and scared at the fact the disease in here called Chimera can cause the blood cells inside us to deteriorate. If you love action movies with a side of romance this should be a must watch for you 10/10. Pure Entertainment."
"M0KUJIN","1","21","42","4 February 2006"," ""Squeeze a Child by It's throat.""
","Devoid of any sense at all, this movie does its best to insult the intelligence of any living human whom views it. It's the type of movie that leaves a 12 year old orgasmicly gasping, while leaving any rationally level headed individual with a deep sense of the ""MISSING TIME"" phenomenon.<br/><br/>The original 1996 ""Mission: Impossible"" movie showed just how an intelligent (while yet entertaining) espionage movie could be made, without a single gun battle, although with several good break-ins and chase scenes. The 1996 ""Mission: Impossible"" was about sabotage, agents, betrayals, heists, set-ups, shake downs and the mission. The plot was intricate and intelligent. It had twist's and turns. The conclusion was great, the ending was great, and the climax was intense. By contrast in this sequel, probably the only people in the world whose heads move fast enough to plan maneuvers like the ones CROOZE improvises in this film are the scriptwriters. <br/><br/>Let me speak to some of the far more child-like idiotic elements of this movie that just left me completely embarrassed, and certainly anything BUT impressed.<br/><br/>In an action sequence, in which a lone Tom Cruise is gunfighting with the villains at a biotechnology compound, the bad guys happen to be perched underneath some barrels labeled - ""DANGEROUS, HAZARDOUS / MEDICAL WASTE"". So what does our innovative Ethan Hunt (played by Tom Cruise) decide to do? He shoots out the barrels and ""KA-BOOM!"" they explode, eliminating the evildoers in a single engulfing explosion.<br/><br/>Now what exactly do movie producers believe constitutes medical waste? C4 explosive? Napalm? How does a barrel full of petri-dishes, used diapers, test tubes, dirty syringes, tainted glassware etc, etc, all of the sudden become an explosive weapon of mass destruction, that takes out a fortified enemy position? If so, can we please kill two birds with one stone and just drop hospital medical waste barrels from B52's in George W. Bush's foreshadowing war against either North Korea or Iran, and save our tax dollars? <br/><br/>There are numerous other inane parts but the above example is illustrative of the movie's approach which is -- F-CK any form of a plot, believability and any form of common sense - full speed ahead on CROOZE appeal and CROOZE facial close-ups with flowing of hair!!!<br/><br/>If you can deal with pointless dialog and non-existent storyline enough to appreciate some CROOZE action sequences and constant CROOZE scenery, and more slow-motion than can be found in the complete catalog of John Madden's Football Highlights Specials, this might be for you.<br/><br/>Otherwise save your time, do something more constructive, such as surfing the net for.....""STUFF""."

"TheHonestCritic","4","2","2","29 April 2020"," There's a reason why this ""movie"" is labeled ""Mission: Impossible"" (2), because this ""film"" is crap!
","""Mission: Impossible II"" (2000), oh man. Where in the world do I begin? This ""film"" is pathetic, with a capital ""P""! Let's just get the negative stuff out of the way. This ""movie"" has a boring cliched story, over the top to dreadful acting, and some dated special effects. The concept for the storyline was actually fairly decent, a villain is trying to inflict biological warfare onto the world. Now that's a sinister plot, so much potential and possibilities could be utilized! So, you would think with such a cool plot idea, the film makers would take great care in producing an excellent film. They did not. This is one of the most lazily executed films I have ever seen. Don't even get me started on the slow-motion sequences! I think if you took out all of the slow motion shots, the ""movie"" would only be five minutes, maybe. I have never seen so much unnecessary use of slow-motion in a movie. Slow-motion can be very effective when utilized properly, but that's not the case here. I think they just did it, ""because""! Such a same, because the concept for the story had so much potential. The acting, overall, is absolutely terrible and nothing short of a joke. Even Tom Cruise is bad in this ""film""! When you watch him in this ""movie"", you can see his ego exploding on overdrive. It's like he went out of the way to make himself look cool, which is just pompous and stuck-up. Such a crying shame, because Tom Cruise is otherwise a fantastic actor! All of the other actors and actresses range from okay to bad. The only actors that seem to actually be trying in this ""movie"" are: Ving Rhames as Luther, Thandie Newton as Nyah (NO, SERIOUSLY, THAT'S HER NAME. I'LL EXPLAIN WHY THAT NAME IS SO FUNNY AND RIDICULOUS LATER.) The other actor that seems to be putting forth effort is Dougray Scott as Sean, the main villain. To be honest, the villain was actually kind of cool. It's just too bad that the script and direction wasn't any better. As for Thandie Newton's character, Nyah, that name cracks me up. Why? Because that name is what's uttered on my favorite show, ""The Three Stooges"". Whenever any of the stooges are scared, or nervous, they yell: ""nyah!"" Maybe they should have thought of that before they gave Thandie Newton's character that name, because that just takes away all seriousness and credibility. As for the special effects, most of them are passable, but there are a few of them that have not aged well. Probably the worst special effects are the bird shots. Yeah, they couldn't even get real birds to be in this ""film"". You know your movie really sucks when even birds show no interest in it! Now for the positives, yes, there are surprisingly positive elements in this ""film"". I always try to find positives in any movie or TV show I watch. The sets/locations are nice and give the ""film"" a decent atmosphere. Finally, the other positive thing is the soundtrack. The soundtrack was well composed, but, I think the standout is the rock and roll version of the ""Mission: Impossible"" theme. That was a unique take on the theme song, but I think it works. It's just sad that it had to be tied to this diarrhea dump of a ""movie"". There are a couple of scenes that are actually not too bad. The opening scene where he climbs the cliff is kind of exciting, however, it is not relevant to the plot. How ironic! The other good scene is the motorcycle chase and final fight at the end. Even those scenes, they still found ways to screw them up. Not so much the motorcycle chase, but the final fight itself. Way too much slow-motion, and too many pointless distracting cut-scenes. ""Mission: Impossible II"" is an embarrassment to an otherwise decent franchise. But, the sad thing is, it didn't have to be! This ""film"" is, by far, the worst ""Mission: Impossible"" movie in the franchise. I give this ""movie"" 2 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. My advice: if you're a fan of the original TV show, and you watch this movie, you will be disappointed. But, if you still wish to see this ""film"", go ahead. I can't tell you not to see something, however, don't say I didn't warn you! On a final note, I just have to say: Director John Woo, Tom Cruise, what were you thinking?! This review will self-destruct in five seconds."

From that point on I decided that this film was not a good film at all.<br/><br/>My wife had asked me several times to buy the mission impossible trilogy as she had never saw them and was a Tom Cruise fan. I finally done this last week. We watched MI and throughly enjoyed it. I mentioned to her I was looking forward to MI3 but did not fancy sitting through MI2 again as I had saw it before and it appeared to be the weakest of the trilogy. Well...we watched it last night and I must say my opinion has changed again! This story is stupid. The script is wooden and Dougray Scott makes me cringe when I hear his Scottish accent on screen (not unusual for a Scotsman to cringe at his own accent!). BUT - the action is superb. John Woo makes for a completely different feel to the first film. This is a pop corn movie. Don't expect witty dialogue or the European feel to the first film. This is brain dead shoot em up material and its actually quite good.<br/><br/>If your going to watch the trilogy then give this a try. Its not supposed to be real, after all its a suspension of reality (like most action films). Take it for that, ignore the poor script and you might just have a nice time watching it. Also, maybe its top flaw is the running time. 90 mins would have been spot on here. Instead we have close to 120 mins.

"jhclues","9","8","14","10 July 2000"," John Woo: The Name Is Action
","Tom Cruise and director John Woo team up for the high-voltage, heart-stopping, edge-of-your-seat action thriller `Mission Impossible 2,' a non-stop rush of excitement that grabs you before the credits even begin to roll with the pulsating vibes of Hans Zimmer's terrific score.  Once again, Cruise stars as Ethan Hunt of the IMF, called into action by his boss, Swanbeck (Anthony Hopkins), when a plot involving a deadly virus is hatched by former IMF agent Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott).  Hunt first has to recruit a professional thief, Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton) to help him get the information he needs to avert a disaster that could ultimately put millions of lives at risk.  Once he has her, the IMF team goes to work; and when they do, they take you with them on a ride that doesn't end until the screen goes dark. 	Simply put, Cruise has never been better; he's matured since the first `Mission Impossible,' and turns in an outstanding performance here, imbuing Hunt with a believable invincibility that gives a luster and credibility to his heroics throughout the film.  Scott is exemplary, as well, and makes his villain and the evil he concocts real.  And Newton is charming as the intrepid Nyah, who first catches Hunt's eye, then proves what she's made of when she becomes an integral part of the intrigue.  Add this to the expertise that Woo brings to this project, and the result is one unforgettable movie.  Working with a superb screenplay by Robert Towne, he takes just enough time to set the plot in motion, and once it starts, it just doesn't stop.  His choreographed action sequences are extraordinary; the motorcycle chase is worthy of any Steve McQueen ever did, and the climactic fight between Hunt and Ambrose should set a new standard for the entire industry.  His use of slow motion interspersed throughout the action is highly effective, and so well done that it heightens the impact of the inherent drama, as does his attention to detail.  Woo more than covers all the bases, and with this work proves beyond the shadow of a doubt that he is one of the finest, if not the best, action directors in the industry, past or present. 	Ving Rhames returns as Luther, and adds that extra spark to the overall proceedings with another fine performance.  The excellent supporting cast also includes William R. Mapother, John Polson, Dominic Purcell and Richard Roxburgh.  `Mission Impossible 2' is a rare and special contribution to the action genre; it fairly rips through the screen and takes no prisoners. It's all here, from the trade mark true- identity-hidden-behind-the-mask to the familiar Lalo Schifrin theme (rendered this time around by metal-rappers Limp Bizkit).  Superior in all ways to the first `Mission Impossible,' this is nothing less than a triumph for Cruise; and John Woo, thy name is Action. For the future, their mission together, if they choose to accept it, is to deliver `Mission Impossible 3.'  In the meantime, don't miss this one; it is one wild trip.  I rate this one 9/10."

"bigyutes","3","7","12","2 July 2006"," Mission Impossible 2 a disgrace to the entire franchise
","Mission Impossible 2 is anything but a spy movie, which is what the whole Mission: Impossible story is supposed to be based off of. The first movie installment of the series contained a very complicated plot that, although was highly criticized, forced the viewer to keep his attention glued to the movie. Mission Impossible 2, however, lacks any type of believable story. There are significant plot holes thruout the film, including the scene towards the end of the film when Tom Cruise puts a mask of himself on the face of the second-main villain. Where did that mask come from? Furthermore, where did he get a mask of the villain from to place on his own head? A significant plot hole that symbolizes the unbelievably poor storyline to begin with. This movie has close to NO resemblance of the original ""spy"" story that Mission Impossible became so loved for. Rather, it is simply a John Woo-directed action movie that happens to star Tom Cruise and contains ridiculously unrealistic action sequences and MAJOR plot holes. Anyone that actually paid money to see this film wasted both their money and the time it took to watch the film. It was VERY disappointing for die hard fans of the first Mission Impossible movie, which had a greatly written storyline, and were expecting the same solid story from the second movie. This movie is a disgrace to the Mission Impossible franchise and I am shocked that they went ahead and made a third installment. M: i III, however, made up for M:i 2's dismal performance and then some."
"Movie-12","7","14","29","9 June 2000"," Involving and exciting, very different from the original film. *** out of ****.
","MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 2 / (2000) ***<br/><br/>""Mission: Impossible 2"" has as much in common with the original movie as hot has with cold. Beyond some of the starring roles, the two productions are as different as day and night. Brian DePalma directed ""Mission: Impossible,"" a puzzling, disjointed action picture leaving little to no hope for a sequel. However, the action-orientated John Woo has taken the position in place of DePalma and captures the excitement, venture, and stylish sequences with more dexterity and structure. ""Mission: Impossible 2"" is relative, involving, and swank. The film takes all too familiar ""James Bond"" components and creates a movie more similar to the licensed to kill spy than the primary contents of the television series.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise once again stars as proselyte I.M.F. agent Ethan Hunt, recently assigned to track down a former representative who possesses a deadly biochemical substance obtained by the murdered scientist Dr. Vladimir Nekhorick (Rade Sherbedgia). The villain, Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott), once had an attractive girlfriend named Nyah Hall (Thandie Newton), whose occupation as a professional thief makes Ethan dissatisfied when he must recruit her as a member of a mission team.<br/><br/>After sleeping and falling in love with her, Ethan oppose the idea of sending Nyah back to Ambrose's luxurious resort to recover information of his criminal intentions. Equipped with a traceable implant, this young woman, Ethan, and his two accomplices Luther (Ving Rhymes), and Billy (John Polson), seek to discover and foil the plans of Ambrose and his accomplices.<br/><br/>The story is clear, involving, and comprehendible; it is not so complex the audience becomes lost and attentions wander. The plot contains enough tension, high stakes, twists, and intriguing characters to keep us on edge.<br/><br/>""Mission: Impossible 2"" is not all story, however, much of the production has a condescending commercial appearance. The sophisticated actors, rock and roll music, intense action sequences, high tech car chase scenes, stylish camera angles, and audience pleasing one liners are more self gratifying rather than entertaining. I can almost see the producers now, discussing what battles scenes and explosions to deposit within the film's theatrical trailer; the filmmakers also need to know that external action itself does not make for a thought-provoking movie.<br/><br/>The production succeeds mainly due to an effective, solidly portrayed villain, keenly acted by Dougray Scott (""Ever After: A Cinderella Story""). He conquers his role with a sense of sly, fiendish wit and knowledge. Tom Cruise again proves he is more than capable of dramatizing Ethan Hunt with style and enticing persuasion. Supporting roles by Thandie Newton, Ving Rhames, Brendan Gleeson, and Anthony Hopkins are also impressive.<br/><br/>""Mission: Impossible 2"" accomplishes that exceptional task of actually being better than its preceding original. The success of this picture is surely due to the direction by John Woo (""Face/Off""), who is one of the better action directors currently in work. His formulaic attitude presents itself in the end, however, as the movie turns from sharp and sneaky to running on sheer adrenaline through the final half hour. It really irritates me when the third act of a movie consists of loud gun shoot-outs, risky stunts, and physical combat in which men dressed in black suits fire seemingly endless rounds at the protagonist only to miss, yet he pulls out a small caliber pistol and shoots every one of them dead. ""Mission: Impossible 2"" may work as an action picture, but it is not at the level of resisting the temptations to throw intellect into the wind and conclude itself in auto pilot mode."
"Prashast_Singh","10","6","10","27 October 2018"," Highly entertaining action movie.
","I feel this movie is quite underrated. While it's not as complex as the first one and the plot is comparatively much easier to understand, MI 2 has its own positives, especially its action sequences. Tom Cruise shines in this one too, and John Woo has extracted a good performance from his cast. The film is a good combination of action and espionage, making it a remarkable action entertainer. While certain twists in the film were exciting, what made me the most happy is the film's action. The climactic action block is excellently cut and the fight choreography places it in my list of best action movies of all time. Recommended watching if you love action movies."

","I know this is an action movie but the ""action"" is so unbelievable as to be ridiculous. Even the futuristic props in the early James Bond films were more believable than this movie. The script, the action, the ""plot"" are all (here is that word again) ridiculous. Next time they should just update the old TV show - and replace Tom Cruise... with anybody. I don't know that this movie was intended to do - other than capitalize on the MI name and make more money. I resisted seeing this film for a long time, but not long enough. Anyone who has not yet seen this movie and is wondering whether to take the time to do so would be well advised to do something else -- anything but watch this movie!"
"wsg31987","7","5","8","1 February 2016"," Now it's time for explosions and gunfire!
","""Mission: Impossible 2"" is to ""Mission: Impossible"" what ""Aliens"" is to ""Alien"". Which is to say, it's almost nothing like it.<br/><br/>The first film was a mystery. This film's plot is mostly known before the opening credits. In the first film, Ethan Hunt subverted the enemy with masks, floppy disks, and laptops. Here, he does it with Berrettas, Glocks, and grenades. In the first film, Ethan is an all American overachiever. Here, he's a wannabe James Bond.<br/><br/>In short, the first film was directed by Brian De Palma, and has his style all over it. This film is directed by John Woo, master of guns and doves, and it's one of his most creatively un stifled American films. How much you enjoy this movie is pretty much dependent upon whether you find Woo's signature blend of slow-motion gun play, campy melodrama, and unlikely bird nests enjoyable or not.<br/><br/>It's certainly fair to say Hollywood wasn't kind to Woo, and this was his second to last American release. Indeed, this film seemed to make Woo a household name, and it's filled with all his hallmarks, which were largely ridiculed afterwards.<br/><br/>Worthy of ridicule? Probably, but hardly unenjoyable. Displaying even more debt to Alfred Hitchcock than the original film, this one ""borrows"" entire scenes and dialogue bits from Hitchcock's Notorious. Ripoff doesn't do it justice. This is an unlicensed remake.<br/><br/>Now, there are worse films you could rip off than Notorious. Unfortunately, both films premise of a woman going undercover at the request of her government agent lover to spy on an ex-boyfriend with nefarious plans isn't helped here by the ludicrous relationship between Tom Cruise's Hunt and Thandie Newton's character. James Bond-ish sexual innuendos and ""fooling around"" is somewhere along the line confused with romance. They exchange bad sexually-charged puns, get in a car chase, get laid, and five minutes later they're having lover's quarrels like an old married couple. It also doesn't help that the two have no chemistry whatsoever.<br/><br/>The only thing holding the film's central premise together is Dougray Scott as the film's villain, and Newton's ex-lover. While Cruise and Newton flatline, Scott looks like he's having way too much fun playing his renegade IMF agent as one part Bond villain, one part Hannibal Lectre, and one part abusive boyfriend. He's a butt-hurt psycho with a snarly grin and slightly unfocused, dead eyes. He sells the entire love triangle even though he's only one third of it.<br/><br/>Whereas the first film subverted the structure and characters of the TV series, this film seems to be content to just ignore it, and be an adaptation in name and rubber mask only. Like the first film, this is not an ensemble, but a star vehicle for Cruise.<br/><br/>Back to the story... Hunt is climbing a cliff in Utah without a rope for fun when a helicopter flies by and shoots a pair of Oakley's at him. He puts them on and receives his mission: help uncover the truth behind the theft of samples of a deadly virus with the help of a professional cat burglar who looks like a supermodel. Later he learns from Anthony Hopkins the thief is in fact the ex-lover of a rogue IMF agent who's stolen the virus for unknown reasons. She is to seduce her still obsessed ex, while uncovering why he would want this zombie apocalypse inducing virus in his possession.<br/><br/>The first 80 minutes of this movie are dedicated to character development and plot. Perhaps not terribly faithful to the old TV series, it at least switches things up from the first movie by at least attempting to develop it's characters. Sure, Cruise and Newton fail, but Cruise isn't any worse here than he was the first time out. And again, Scott is excellent.<br/><br/>Luther Stickell is back, similarly likable as he was in the first film.<br/><br/>It's when you hit that 80 minute mark that the film takes a turn, and the rest of the movie sees John Woo cutting loose with nonstop car chases, gun fights, and a bizarre motorcycle jousting match which turns into a kung-fu fight.<br/><br/>Not that any of this is unenjoyable. Whether you are invested in the love story or are laughing at it, whether you are thrilled by the action sequences or slapping your knees because it's all just so ridiculous, the film is undoubtedly entertaining.<br/><br/>Much as I wrote about the first film, this one was under appreciated. As the 2000s would wear on, M:I-2 is commendable for it's old-fashioned stunt-work in lieu of CGI. It's particularly noticeable when compared to the next installment, which opts for the digital over the practical. This movie was in many ways representative of the end of the old way of action filmmaking. And it's a thrill to watch, however ludicrous."

I haven't seen anyone remark on the similarity of the plot of MI-2 to the plot of Hitchcock's ""Notorious"" (1946, Cary Grant & Ingrid Bergman). Both feature a male spy falling in love with a less than virtuous woman. Both have the male spy reluctantly asking his new love to seduce an old boyfriend for the sake of the cause. And both films even feature scenes at the racetrack where the woman meets up with the male spy to pass him information. Of course Hitch didn't have quite the same action punch. ;)"

","I did not really watch the Mission Impossible movies until lately. I only saw some of the earlier entries in TV many years ago. Recently I started from the beginning. The first one was a good film overall. The second however is a different story. Some of the trademark elements are on the top here, like the frequent use of lifelike masks and the top-notch action scenes. Still, I had a hard time watching this title throughout. Somehow the directing made it a chore to enjoy. Melancholia was a daydream compared to this. Otherwise, the story was pretty dull, the whole character and romantic progression was awkward. I did not feel the connections believable and rushed. Of course, this is an action movie, but still it needs to be coherent. If one part of the experience is weaker than it is needed to be put on the sidetracks, not in the front as the main motivation."
"osleraar","1","3","4","21 July 2000"," What a waste of my time.
","This movie was so terrible, I only stayed to watch it because I needed to ride home with the other people I was with.  I must say that the scene in the beginning was enough to make my palms sweat while sitting there. Since I am an avid rock climber, I could relate to the situation well.  However, the scene was ruined when he made the impossible jump from ledge to ledge. Unless Ethan has gecko hands, he would never have held on.  This was prelude to the rest of the movie where I saw uncountable numbers of COMPLETELY unrealistic things happening.  ranging from technical impossibilities to the the laws of physics being beligerantly ignored.  If a movie is going to capture an audience it has to make the image that it COULD happen, and this was not the case with MI2.<br/><br/>I managed to entertain myself with trying to figure out how short the movie would have been if John Woo made the action scenes real-time.  After about 15 minutes it got to be just unbearable to watch more of the slow motion that had no purpose.  Shots that really had no dramatic effect were slowed to the typical Woo speed.  I saw many scenes that would have been really cool, and adrenaline pumpers if they had been left at full speed.<br/><br/>Besides all of the bad directing, and absense of any physical laws, the plot was unimaginitive, and boring.  The characters were not properly developed. The whole movie was depending on the action scenes, which frankly, made me want to wretch."

","Mission: Impossible - Fallout is coming out next week, so naturally I decided to watch and review every single movie of the franchise. I already wrote my thoughts on Mission: Impossible (1996) and now it is time for the second installment of the saga ... Where we, unfortunately, reach the bottom (better sooner than later).<br/><br/>Even though the action stunts are still mostly realistic and very well filmed, they reach a point where I can't buy into them anymore. From two guys colliding mid-air after jumping from their bikes at high speed to explosions spread throughout the entire runtime, this film is pretty bad. 60 minutes into it and there isn't a single action sequence. The suspense and tension, which are a stamp of the first movie, are nowhere near the levels that they used to be, and the slow-motion is excessively employed.<br/><br/>The story incorporates a love triangle between Ethan Hunt, Sean Ambrose, and Nyah that feels so strangely awkward and unnecessary. There is an evident James Bond vibe to this film, and that is precisely what wrecked it. This is Mission: Impossible and John Woo almost ruined the whole saga. Tom Cruise's character is an entirely different agent. He transforms himself into this sort of playboy kind of guy who has nothing to do with the Hunt that I know from M:I-1. The whole story hinges on the audience's feelings about his relationship with Nyah, but I can't care enough about Thandie Newton's character because she simply has no depth!<br/><br/>Ving Rhames was by far the best secondary character in the first movie. In this one, Luther is just a computer nerd and his funny personality is gone. Dougray Scott plays a boring villain with generic motivations, and everyone else doesn't really matter. There is a severe lack of character development. Nevertheless, the saving grace of M:I-2 is definitely its cast. Newton is very charming as Nyah, Scott makes his awful script more believable and Cruise is ... Well, Tom Cruise.<br/><br/>He continues to do all his stunts, and there are some ""money shots"" that he performs exceptionally well. To be honest, this film has some beautiful cinematography and a magnificent Hans Zimmer's score. Even when the action takes itself too seriously, these aspects at least make it bearable. John Woo does a lot of things the wrong way, but he adds some subtle details to his shots that become important to the plot later on.<br/><br/>However, this is about it. There are so many cons to overwhelm the pros. The editing is all over the place. The pacing is no longer frenetic as it was in the previous movie. Like I wrote above, I have to wait more than one hour to enjoy some freaking action. The first half of the film is slow and tedious, while the second half starts to accelerate to finish in style. The ending has so much action that most of it becomes stupid. I mean, really stupid. Some moments are supposed to be taken seriously, but it is a tough task not to laugh at the hilarious set pieces.<br/><br/>How can a sequel to such a fantastic action movie be so bad? Well, M:I-2 is the undeniable proof. There are so many things gone wrong with this one. John Woo transformed a confusing yet mysterious plot from the first installment into a hilariously awful screenplay. The plot is quite predictable, the story is emotionally weightless, and even the action goes to levels of dumbness that I've only witnessed in the worst possible films. A great cast and some nice technical details help counterweigh the cons, but Tom Cruise's lead saves the day."
"Jakealope","1","10","20","23 September 2002"," Aside from the High Tech & Kung Foo Stunts
","It was cheesy Bond-like forgettable junk. Jon Woo might be Mr High Speed Action and you get that in spades in this flick, but it has absolutely nothing to do with the original series's concept. The original series involved convoluted plots, deceptions, rubber masks and high tech gadgets executed by a team of experts, emphasis on the team. The original series wasn't John LeCarre or Hitchcock with all those rubber mask switcheroos, but it was plot driven and had no flash. Also, it had almost no violence, sex or chase scenes. The new one is just the opposite: Its all violence, cheesy Bond type lovers, chase scenes, and just Tom. It has nothing at all to do with the spirit of the original series, it's just an action packed, mindless Cruise fest."

The action scenes are the most ridiculous, over-the-top, comedic, absurd, preposterous action scenes ever filmed. I laughed out loud several times. EVERYTHING explodes when Cruise shoots it...EVERYTHING - don't be surprised if you see wooden chairs exploding in this movie. Cruise does the most pointless stunts imaginable, like dragging his feet on the side of a motorcycle (COOL!!!!??) and doing nose wheelies across the street on his motorcycle (NEAT!!!!!) I was actually waiting for Cruise to do a dance after his K.O. on the sand, take off his glasses, crush them under his foot, then wink at the camera and do a thumbs up just in case. Cruise is also a master fighter, gunman, base jumper, biker, driver, and all-around perfect guy.<br/><br/>Bad guys chase after Cruise, who is actually invincible in this movie, and die left and right in bloodless, painless deaths. It actually makes violence fun and cool! The bad guys outnumber Cruise and unload hundreds of bullets and can't even come close to hitting him, yet Cruise can do barrel rolls off of motorcycles while shooting his gun and blowing up trucks with ease. I was hoping he would've been blindfolded - wouldn't have been implausible. This might appeal to a 9-year-old. That seems to be the target audience. <br/><br/>The 2-disc DVD has almost 10 minutes of bonus features! There's a skit, some awards show excerpts, and a very short documentary. That's it. Real pathetic cash-in. The only reason it was released is to add the M:I-3 teaser. Boo."

","Has anybody else noticed? A lot of references are being made to the 1946 script by Ben Hecht for Alfred Hitchcock's Notorious.<br/><br/>First of all the plot in itself is very similar, with the female spy, the Mata Hari, who has to sacrifice herself and marry the crook, so that the protagonists can get to him. Just like in Notorious, the woman in MI2 is the one who really risks her life, while the male hero is on the outside.<br/><br/>Second of all, the whole scene at the horse racing tracks in MI2 is a more or less exact replica of the one in Notorious.<br/><br/>If you have seen both MI2 and Notorious, you will know what I mean.<br/><br/>I don't think that it is anything wrong at all that Robert Towne (he himself a great playwrite) copies the intrigues of the superb script by Ben Hecht. On the contrary it should be seen as a tribute to the latter. I am disappointed however that no one else (that I know of) has noticed and commented this.<br/><br/>I also think that this is the perfect example of how modern special effects, action and all that crap, ruins the great intrigues of a brilliant screenwriter, and takes away all the excitement. This is also very obvious when you look at the results, whilst Notorious is one of the best films in the history of cinema, MI2 is a blasphemy.<br/><br/>/O"

Hope you're listening Mr Woo...<br/><br/>a) People's hair blowing in the wind is at best a mildly diverting spectacle, not the basis for the plot of an entire movie.

They'd should've just gotten Pierce Brosnan to play Ethan, changed a couple of names, and there it is, another bad Bond spy flick. I was disgusted at the ridiculously overdone action sequences. The fight scene at the end is laughable. Many in the theater I was in left before the end. Perhaps the most disgusting part of this film is Ethan's love interest. This is what makes it most like a cheesy Bond flick. Ethan meets girl, and within 10 minutes they're all over each other. Her character was supposed to be an expert thief, but she ends up being the dumb damsel in distress. Her thief skills NEVER EVEN COME INTO PLAY AT ALL!! Even the cool gadgets and technology weren't interesting this time around. The  exploding sunglasses at the beginning that were shown in slow motion as they blew up just seemed so cliche. This is the worst movie to come out since The Postman or Armageddon. Don't see this one. Save yourself some cash and go rent a movie. Anything is better than this disgusting work.

It became a game to see JUST HOW MANY tired cliches they could fit in at the end.<br/><br/>Except for the fact that characters actually DIED, the stunts and action seemed better suited to the A-Team than to a modern thriller.  It would have been far more effective if it at least had Mr. T and George Peppard -- or better yet, Peter Graves and Leonard Nimoy -- people you EXPECT to see in cheesy over-the-top cartoonish tripe like this.<br/><br/>Maybe the low budget of Hong-Kong films is a GOOD thing.  I usually love John Woo movies, but if this is what happens when he gets his hands on a major studio budget, I wish he'd go back to the chop-socky stuff that made him famous.<br/><br/>This movie is almost bad enough to be recommended on that score alone.  It's no Plan 9 From Outer Space, but it is stupendously awful."
"scubergmu","2","6","11","20 June 2001"," How the hell did this movie get made?
","(This is a corrected version of the review already submitted)<br/><br/>   I wonder if John Woo or Tom Cruise, or anybody associated with this film is actually proud of the product they created?  Do you think they were all tied to some contract and had to make it, or some guys from the studio would come and cut off their thumbs or something?  I'm really at a loss on this one.      This was just about the worst movie I have ever seen in my life.  Now I'll admit, I haven't gotten around to seeing Battlefield Earth yet, so that distinction may change, but for now, yes, the worst.  This movie embodies all the things that are wrong with big budget action movies in Hollywood. To start, it was nothing more than a vanity project on behalf of Tom Cruise. Like a lot of highly-paid leading men, his contract clearly stipulated that he not be in the film unless his character is the ultimate bad-ass of all time.  Forget the fact that there was no character to play, he doesn't even need a name, Ethan Hunt, forget it, just call him ""hero"".  That's all there is to it.  And wasn't the ""romance"" of the film so well done as well?  I mean, he did know this woman for a whole weekend before he was madly in love and willing to risk his life for her, so it all works.<br/><br/>     Then there's our bad guy played by Dougray Scott, who, like our hero, is so generic and predictable he can just be called ""villain"", nothing more. Like all action movie bad-guys, he's only interested in money, and he'll just keep on blowing up busloads of nuns and clubbing baby seals until he gets it.  And he looks just like Tom Cruise when he's wearing a Tom Cruise mask, even though he, like most men, is a half a foot taller than Tom Cruise!  But hey, its an action movie, it doesn't have to make sense.  Oh but there's more... The plot of MI2 was so weak and subordinate to the action scenes that most reviewers at the time simply described it as ""having something to do with a virus"".  Yes that is definitely the way to put it, there's nothing more than that.  But since they had to pay $20 million for Tom Cruise's salary, they couldn't afford to hire anyone who knows anything about viruses as a consultant. So we get a movie that's on par with Armageddon where realism is concerned.  <br/><br/> I could write a book about why this movie sucked, so let me just try and wrap it all up:<br/><br/>   The plot was almost non-existent, the characters were derivative, one-dimensional, and uninteresting, the action was over-the-top, ridiculous, and generally an insult to the audience's intelligence (particularly at the very end).  Oh yes, and I almost forgot, occasionally brilliant actor Anthony Hopkins was in a couple of minutes of the film, further revealing to us that he'll act in absolutely anything, just so long as the check clears. <br/><br/>    To put it mildly, all people associated with the production of Mission Impossible II should be deported to third-world countries that do not yet possess the technology to make motion pictures so they can't waste 125 million dollars on s**t like this again."

","I didn't really like this. While I am a fan of the first M.I., and of the Die-Hard type flix in general-I  know, as in every genre, it HAS to be believable on its own terms. And this frankly wasn't. I didn't buy the motorbike stunts-be it the infamous Tom Cruise footdrag at 80 or all the weaving in and outta traffic or the big time Milli-Vanilli chest bump(if you have seen this you know what I mean!) that happens when they both go catapulting off their bikes right at one another, mid air. Followed by a real long, drawn out Matrix style fight on the beach.<br/><br/>Why is it that the baddies fire 100's of Uzi rounds, can't hit Tom as he runs right across open space in front of them-but whenever he pulls his 9MM or whatever, in two shots he kills two guys, third shot hits a tankard of explosives which is conveniently placed right behind the now dead baddie, etc. Everything that possible can go Boom(cars, bikes, drums, etc) does go boom here. It's goofy.<br/><br/>Unplotted plot, takes the Ebola virus and mixes in the Notorious angle. Thandie Newton should eat something. Cruise does his stunts well but sleepwalks through it all. The baddie is James Bond level. Ving Rhames is OK but that is about it. (I think I saw him play a similar role elsewheres, come to think of it...)<br/><br/>Don't even get me going with the fake masks(Tom is 5-7 by the way, the villain is def. taller), and the incoherent plot.<br/><br/>Try again?

","Considering that this movie is made by John Woo, known for graphic violence, this is a very PG movie. <br/><br/>Had they given Woo free reigns, like they did with Face Off, who knows, what kind of movie this might have been. I know that the M.I. movies are PG13. But this movie is the only one that feels like it's made for children and not adults. It is that bad. <br/><br/>In this M.I. movie and only in this M.I. movie Hunt for some reason has a problem with killing people. Which means he acts out of character, compared to every other M.I. movie. <br/><br/>Also, when people are shot, it's almost always happening off camera. Which is annoying as hell and reminds me of the awful fourth Indiana Jones movie. <br/><br/>If the rating don't allow you to show people being shot, complete with bulletholes and blood, then don't have people being shot in your goddamn movie. <br/><br/>I really hate the MPAA. They have ruined, what could have been so many good movies with their cencorship. <br/><br/>Nyah is unattractive and too skinny and annoying. And the signifigant height differrence between Tom Cruise and Dougray Scott, makes it laughable that Scotts character can impersonate Cruises character just by wearing the famous masks and nobody can tell the difference, between the two.<br/><br/>The plot is a joke. And besides from the last half hour of non stop action, this movie does not deserve to be a part of the M.I. franchise. <br/><br/>And enough with the goddamn doughs. <br/><br/>Do not watch this. you can easily skip it and enjoy the rest of the movies, without misssing out on anything."

","I see Mission: Impossible 2 as ""Hulk 03"" of M:I movies. Both were hated and bashed by moviegoers, although those were excellent. For example Hulk 03 still has the best CGI and it has lots of action, but people remember the first 40 minutes, being very boring for them while the real boring one with bad CGI was the second one. People say that this sequel with a boring first half has a different style than the original first film, but wasn't it supposed to be like that? If you ask me, the first film was an exclusively stylish, low key espionage thriller, but it was little boring and slow paced at times. I liked and very enjoyed even the third movie with magical JJ Abrams touch! However, this second film perfectly delivers as an action packed and believe me that cliché virus story and the dated romance is not the point. This is a John Woo movie! In this sequel, now Ethan Hunt is a trained martial artist, a gunfighter, what would be the best that could happen? In this movie, the mission teller device does not terminate itself by smoldering, because this is a John Woo movie! In the second half, you are awarded with some incredible stunt work and action sequences! Also I think the best soundtrack for a M:I movie is here, too. The things that Hunt performs by that motorbike is amazing. If you expect a Bullitt type of a movie, of course you will be disappointed, but it is pure action and pure entertainment. If you look at the posters of the first two films, you can see that while the first one looks like a classical, old school spy thriller, the second one prepares you for a hell ride! We watch a different, tricky Ethan Hunt here equipped with lots of skills, almost like a single army and I love that! This is not a sophisticated or intellectual action film, but it is definitely not an empty or dumb summer blockbuster. The tone of the movie is just perfect for a M:I movie of course with a different touch by Woo! The mountain scene of the film is a hilarious and pure joy! The last 20 minutes of the film is an awesome action packed! Is it exaggerating? Yes. Is it overblown? No. Is it hilarious and cool? Definitely Yes! John Woo is a great action filmmaker and he doesn't make movies like this anymore."

"pyrocitor","7","4","7","17 October 2004"," Enjoy the ride
","For all who have seen the first Mission: Impossible film, it becomes rapidly clear that M:I2 gives almost no sense of it being a sequel. This could be interpreted as either a good thing or a bad thing - it's true that the sense of intrigue and constantly twisting plot of the original is lost. In M:I2, the plot is fairly simple, and each twist becomes clear far before it happens. But enough plot is still decent, as IMF (Impossible Mission Force, hence comes the franchise title) agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) races to stop rogue agent Sean Ambrose (the ever excellent Dougray Scott) from obtaining a killer virus called Chimera, after the monster from Greek mythology. To get to Ambrose, he recruits Ambrose's ex-girlfriend Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton) to rejoin her ex, and act as the 'inside woman' for the team. This develops adequately enough, leading to the necessary insanely complicated aerial acrobatics, which are strongly reminiscent of the first film, and a bone crunching motorcycle chase to enormous man-to-man fistfight at the finale. Not too profound perhaps, but for an action movie, it's not bad.<br/><br/>The script is very hit and miss; it's true there are some excellent and endlessly quotable lines strewn throughout, but we get stuck with a lot of overly dramatic clunkers like ""We just rolled up a snowball and tossed it into Hell"", which would be easier to overlook, had the cast put more enthusiasm into their performances. Indeed, Tom Cruise acts as if it was not his choice to return this time round, and Ving Rhames as computer hacker Luther Stickel is equally uncomfortable in returning. But Dougray Scott is consistently excellent as dastardly villain Ambrose, and Thandie Newton, Richard Roxburgh as Ambrose's chief henchman and Brendan Gleeson as a crooked industrialist working alongside Ambrose all give great performances.There is also an unexpected cameo from Anthony Hopkins as Hunt's mission commander Swanbeck, which would have worked better had he been developed into more of a major character, giving Hopkins more to do. As it is, he is good-natured enough with his fleeting minutes of screen time, and he's given some great lines, much in the line of M from the Bond films.<br/><br/>Speaking of Bond, when did Hunt turn into his carbon copy? In the first movie, the filmmakers worked hard to keep the two secret agents easily distinguishable, but now Hunt seems like a pale shadow of Her Majesty's finest agent. The love plot is handled entirely in the style of a Bond movie, cheesy innuendo and all, Hunt's relations with Swanbeck are entirely the same as how Bond reacts to M, and there's even a car chase through the mountains plundered directly out of Goldeneye. Thankfully, further into the film, Hunt starts to develop more of his own personality, but there's a strong scent of Bond all the way throughout.<br/><br/>The directing, which in the original was smooth and effortless, is sped up and choppy in the sequel. Director John Woo plays to his strengths here, but overindulges his fetishes for slow-mo and kung fu moves, making the film seem simply ridiculous at times. Even for a secret agent, it is more than impossible to take as much physical punishment and perform as many gravity defying martial arts moves as Hunt does at the film's climax, and do we really need to see a slow-mo shot of Hunt walking towards his car? Clearly, realism has left the building, (particularly in the end showdown, which is entertaining to be sure, but one can't help but laugh as Hunt pulls off far too many martial art tricks on his adversary) and it's more glaringly obvious in M:I2 than most similar action films.<br/><br/>But in spite of all my criticism, I enjoyed this movie a lot. Because it is essential, quality film-making? Definitely not. But what it is, is some good, old fashioned, BIG LOUD FUN. Our over glorified hero takes on and defeats countless enemies while performing breathtaking stunts to the sounds of a consistently excellent blaring rock soundtrack by Hans Zimmer. What more can you ask than that? M:I2 was a genuinely entertaining blockbuster which supplied all the car chases, explosions, shootouts and death-defying stunts to make a truly excellent action film. Who really needs all that other stuff, like story or script anyway?<br/><br/>-7/10"

They're probably right, but at least the story is easy to follow in this one. I thought the twists with people wearing masks were actually pretty clever.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise returns as Ethan Hunt and once again proves that he can carry an action blockbuster with no problem. Thandie Newton is eye candy and plays a real role in the story. The main villain of the film, Sean Ambrose, played by Dougray Scott, makes this a love triangle. Ambrose is a decent if not great villain.<br/><br/>This movie has quite a lot of action. The motorcycle chase and subsequent hand-to-hand combat between Hunt and Ambrose at the end will give you the bang for your buck. There is also an exciting gun sequence at Ambrose's laboratory.<br/><br/>They scenery in Australia is really lovely and I liked the update of the M:I theme song. I don't like that Anthony Hopkins only had a minor role, though.<br/><br/>After the dull first installment, this movie was a breath of fresh air.

","Going to the movies is a great adventure for me, and as people have asked me over the years, I've developed a sense of two qualities that I value.<br/><br/>One is the mastery of cinematic values, and I was surprised to find that here. The surprise is because I've to my knowledge only seen one other Woo film: `Face Off.' That seemed nervous and uncontrolled, rather like Nick Cage. Also, I'm normally no fan of Cruise: his instrument is puggish with a big nose and squeeky voice -- he struts too much for me. And summer movies normally bore me with all their me-tooisms,<br/><br/>But here (as with `Gladiator') is great understanding and control of the motion on the screen, of the anticipation of the movement of the eye, of the mastery of sequenced colors. Thankfully with this, and at this pace, we don't need much acting or story. I'd say Woo is somewhat stupid in many of the storytelling and human engagement values. But gosh, he's got the motion right. And that matters."

"rparham","7","3","5","12 June 2006"," Not quite as good a Mission
","It is difficult to think of a sequel that deviates from it's predecessor's style and format as much as Mission: Impossible II. The 1996 original was a reasonably faithful updating of the formula of the original 1960s television series, with some variations, as to be expected. Mission: Impossible II is a full-on action film, however, loaded with fights, car chases and some outrageously unbelievable moments. It is not necessarily unentertaining, but it is a bit of a drop from the first film.<br/><br/>Mission: Impossible II opens in Sydney, Australia, where bio-technologist Dr. Nekhorvich (Rade Sherbedgia) has decided to smuggle a deadly virus out of the pharmaceutical company he works for and attempt to turn it and the antidote over to the U.S. government. On his way to America, he is murdered and the virus stolen by rogue IMF agent Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) who plans to sell it back to the company for millions. IMF agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is recruited to stop Ambrose from fulfilling his mission, and in doing so forms an alliance with an old lover of Ambrose, Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton), a thief who Hunt promptly falls in love with himself.<br/><br/>Where Mission: Impossible was criticized for having an overly complicated plot, Mission: Impossible II is pretty much the exact opposite. The plot is straightforward and, frankly, relatively thin. Mission: Impossible II replaces complex plotting with over-the-top, high octane action. Directed by Hong Kong action supremo John Woo, Mission: Impossible II is definitely very much reflective of his individual style. Woo is responsible for balletic action operas in his native country, including such films as The Killer and Hard Boiled, which were distinctive for their almost non-stop action sequences that were assembled with extreme style. Woo's two prior American films, Hard Target and Broken Arrow, also are reflective of his style, although both lacked the kick of his Asian work. Mission: Impossible II is more of his traditional element, full of hand to hand combat, with extreme, borderline unbelievable results.<br/><br/>In bringing his unique style to Mission: Impossible II, Woo film has refashioned the series from a cerebral suspense thriller to a modern day James Bond knock-off, with Hunt at center stage and all the supporting players kept at arm's length. Mission: Impossible II delivers on some impressive sequences, and they are by no means boring, but the absolute absurdity of it all quickly begins to wear out it's welcome. But it is fun at times, and Woo delivers some pretty pictures, full of many of his trademark elements (including plenty of doves in action sequences).<br/><br/>On the character front, Mission: Impossible II is fairly bare bones. Thandie Newton is capable as thief turned secret agent Nyah, but her romance with Hunt is fairly uninvolving. There isn't a lot of chemistry or draw to the two of them, and at times their relationship seems like a plot necessity and not an integral component of the story. Dougray Scott does the appropriate amount of mustache twirling as despicable villain Ambrose, but he is occasionally over the top and manages to make his character into a bit of a caricature at times. Ving Rhames returns as Luther Stickle, the only character to return from the first film other than Hunt, but he and fellow team member Billy Baird (John Polson) are given cameos at best. Cruise is once again capable, but hardly amazing as Ethan Hunt. He delivers what is necessary for the role, but nothing else.<br/><br/>Mission: Impossible II could be viewed in the larger sense as another example of the dumbing down of American movies. The producers, reeling from complaints of Mission: Impossible's complexity and also possibly it's lack of action have delivered the exact antithesis with the sequel: a film which looks good, moves fast, and in which lots of stuff gets blowed up real good. But that is all there is, and while entertaining, you can't help but think something is missing at the core."

It is totally dumb in comparison to his extremely well acted role in Magnolia. Personally, I think that John Woo is a good director when you look at the action sequences, and I know that he uses a lot of slow motion in these sequences. But, he used to much slow motion for me so that it became irritating and the action sequences looked too unrealistic! I liked John Woo's Face/Off and Hard Target, but this was a total flop and even more worse than Broken Arrow! Barbarella is still my number one worst movie ever seen, but this one will certainly enter the top ten of this list! What was Anthony Hopkins doing in this movie by the way?! I will conclude this extremely negative review by saying that I'm glad I only saw it on VHS for 2 dollars (I've had a bad feeling about this! (see Star Wars)) and that a lot of people were fooled by going to the cinemas to see this stupid piece of junk (see Star Wars)!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>P.s.

The true star of ""MI 2"" wasn't the dynamic Cruise. Instead, famous Hong Kong action movie maestro John Woo took the franchise to heights heretofore never scaled with his stylishly orchestrated action sequences and his flying doves. At that time, Woo was known primarily for his foreign actioneers ""The Killer"" (1989) and ""Hard-Boiled"" (1992), but he had recently come to America and made a name for himself the unforgettable Jean-Claude Van Dame thriller ""Hard Target"" (1993) and then surpassed himself with the John Travolta & Christian Slater saga ""Broken Arrow"") after which Travolta and Nic Cage teamed up for his splendid law & order yarn ""Face/Off"" (1997). Dougray Scott digs his heels in hard as our hero's chief adversary and their showdown on motorcycles is spine-tingling stuff. Thandie Newton plays Cruise's leading lady.

You will never see another Mission Impossible like this. With Limp Bizkit doing the theme song, this version of Ethan hunt, this dramatic, this style of action...True it Is the least like a classic mission impossible but it does feature an impossible mission and Tom Cruise is in it so that's good enough for me....and it's a hell of an entertaining and stylish spy action film....I never really looked at this as lacking action, I always thought of it as the most action packed, but the more I look at it it really doesn't start unleashing full on action scenes until the third act...and boy does it deliver. But the rest of the film is so stylish and fun that I don't care...Whereas in Ghost Protocol and Rogue Nation, it kicks off with action, peaks in the middle, and slightly loses momentum coming into the third act...or in Mission 1 where it isn't even really a full on action film per say, and has only a few distinct set pieces amidst a lot of suspense and mystery...MI2 kicks off with a big bang, and then becomes a NOTORIOUS style love story and has some heist and mission impossibly stuff going on through out, but it really bottles up all the big action and stunts, saving it for the end, and then just unleashes it it all for the last 30 minutes or so....and its a great payoff. Best third act (Fallout comes close) of any Mission film and right up there with The Matrix as one of the best third acts of any action movie. Ethan Hunt jumping from that building, blatantly ripping off Last of the Mohicans (not to mention GoldenEye earlier in the film) and then building eventually into The motorcycle chase and the martial arts battle on the beach....John Woo is the Hitchcock of action films. He directs action with ease and grace and elevates it to an almost poetry. His style really elevates the material. The slow mo, the doves.... Its so great...Tom Cruise adapts perfectly to this style of action with his long hair and convincing stunt work with the guns, motorcycles, and kung fu stuff...its a movie of its time that people like to hate on. And they all raise good points. But for the style they're going for, I think this movie more than succeeds. Its entertaining and fun and cool."

Who cares about such things as plot and character development when the actors look cool doing cool stuff. According to Robert Towne, his script was written around action scenes that John Woo had already planned. And sadly it shows in the movie. It's full of plot holes. The mask thing became tiresome too!! <br/><br/>Doing this movie (his first sequel, not counting Colour Of Money) did gave Cruise the freedom to experiment with more offbeat choices like Eyes Wide Shut and Magnolia. So when they don't perform at the box office, the damage was minimal and it was not career threatening. <br/><br/>Mission Impossible 2 grossed $215 million at the domestic box office to end 2000 the 3rd highest grossing movie of the year.

While the general consensus amongst critics seems to criticise the weak plot and poor characters, it doesn't focus on the positives of the film, namely the improved action, a simple narrative, and a brilliant music score.<br/><br/>Mission Impossible I is renowned for a lack of action, with focus devoted to developing a plot so complicated no one has a chance of following it without pausing to think about it. Ethan Hunt is about the only person who gets any proper character development, and the film feels as though it drags on forever and ever (the theft of the NOC files felt like an eternity!)<br/><br/>But Mission Impossible II is paced better, with an easier to follow plot, more character development and a music score that is far less boring than that of the first. Maybe the first has a more engaging plot (as confusing as it is), and the action scenes of this film may be unnecessary in some regards, but these aren't sins to the movie, and for the most part it is entertaining.<br/><br/>The film stars actor Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt, who, other than a new haircut, brings back the same stunning character from the first into the dangerzone. Tom Cruise, also acting as producer for the film, insisted on doing his own stunts, and does a brilliant job of portraying his character.<br/><br/>The story is simple, which for some is reason for criticism, however I view it as a positive. Hunt is assigned the task of recruiting master-thief Naya (Thandie Newton), for a mission to take down suspected mole of IMF Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott), who is planning to release a disease, Chimera, and charge a hefty price on its antidote. In recruiting her, the pair form an intimate relationship, one of which will prove risky in regard to the mission. <br/><br/>Having recruited the help of tech-whiz Luther (Ving Rhames) from the first film, and pilot Billy (John Polson), the four travel to the land down under, Australia, with Naya sent to infiltrate Sean's mansion in Sydney, using a method other than her thieving capabilities. It is this that bothers many viewers, as Naya plays a role no more than a romantic interest for most of the movie. However, there was only one major female antagonist in the first movie who did little more, so this is still an improvement.<br/><br/>The film takes place in Sydney, the largest city in Australia. Perhaps being my home city I am biased, but it is great to finally see Sydney in an action film. However, unsurprisingly, the errors in geography bother me. There is absolutely no way the team would have landed in the middle of a desert, near Broken Hill, a town more than 1000km from Sydney, when arriving. out of the way to be doing so. It's moments like these that would make people think Sydney is smack-bang next to the desert; it isn't even close.<br/><br/>I cannot see how Sean and Ethan get onto a semi-rural road towards the end of the film in the motorbike chase. I don't believe there is any such road, at least near to the CBD, though I could be wrong. It's also a shame the Sydney Harbour Bridge isn't part of the motorcycle chase in some way. However, this would have made even less geographical sense than it already did. <br/><br/>There is also the fact that Sean somehow gets his car into Darling Harbour, which would have definitely turned eyes in a pedestrian- only precinct, but we can disregard this minor detail.<br/><br/>The film can be commended for its romance, which while not perfect, is far better than the sloppy attempt at one in the first film. It also allows for development of another character other than Hunt himself. Sean Ambrose is a fairly decent villain, and is at least known for the entire film unlike Job in the first, allowing proper development of his character. However, just about every character other than Hunt could have done with more development.<br/><br/>Action in this film is far better than that of the first. Combat scenes are much more engaging, including most prominently the motorcycle scene, and the theft scene is paced a lot better than that of the NOC files in the first. As mentioned the plot is far simpler, although there are many plot holes. The film's original cut was at almost 3 hours, which explains why many parts of the film do not make sense.<br/><br/>The film features a score by Hans Zimmer who, infamous for his intertwining of electronic instruments into orchestras, brings a stunning rendition of the Mission Impossible theme, with electronic guitars and percussion that bring out the most intense action scenes.<br/><br/>It's a shame more Australians didn't star in this film; John Polson is the only actor who plays an Australian in the film, who unsurprisingly has a stereotypical Steve-Irwin styled accent, and says the word 'mate' way too much. You'll be hard pressed to find an Aussie who actually sounds like that. While Richard Roxburgh is an Australian, his character Hugh Stamp is (apparently) South African.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is a good watch. Perhaps the plot is simplistic, with characters who need more development. However, the action is far better, with the movie not being as close to slow and boring as the first. The romance is also greatly improved. Setting the film in Sydney, a city little seen on the silver screen, was a wise choice.<br/><br/>This film is well worth a watch. Don't expect the best movie you've ever seen, but don't expect nothing either; you will be rewarded."

","ACTION MOVIE!! if these words get your heart racing and your blood pumping then this is an absolute must see. The stunts in this movie HAVE to be seen to be believed. From the cliff hanging (groan:)) opening scene to the final fight scene are out of this world. Particularly breath taking are the car ballet scenes. Watching an Audi TT and a Porsche Boxter do 360 turns along a country cliff top road BESIDE each other missing each other by inches , had me on the edge of my seat.Oh and on another point thandie Newton is stunning in this movie."
"CT2001","10","2","3","16 July 2000"," Excellent Action Film
","This movie was an excellent Action Film, let's leave it at that.  The makers of this movie were not out to win oscars, for best picture, screenplay-or actor, even thought Cruise played an action hero in a fashion that's never been done before.  Think about a real actor, playing someone like that-you can't get better than that.  I think that although scenes, like the balcony scene with Cruise and Newton, and the race Track and most of the whole premesis-made this movie out to be an updated action version of Hitchcock's ""Notorious"", I still think this was an awesome movie, with great action, and a good story-that will start a trend in artsy action pictures.  Mission Accomplished."
"lsorrell","10","2","3","14 July 2000"," Mask, graphics make for enjoyable movie.
","It has really good computerized graphics.  I thought the masking part was very good.  I enjoyed the movie very much. It was better than Mission Impossible (1996).  Tom Cruise looked better with his hair long.  Douglas Scott as Shawn Ambrose was excellent, too."
"kylezombie","10","2","3","24 May 2000"," This movie is incredible
","I do not understand all the negative feedback about this film.  It is one of the best action/suspense movies I've seen in a long time. First of all, the original movie was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The acting was so incredibly bad, and the so-called ""confusing"" plot seemed very mainstream to me. When I first heard of the sequel, I groaned, but then I learned that John Woo would be at the helm.  My animosity soon turned to anticipation. While Woo's early American films (Hard Target, Broken Arrow) couldn't even compare to his Chinese movies (A Better Tomorrow, Hard Boiled), his latest movie, Face/Off was a real winner. While keeping the suspenseful MI style scenarios intact, Woo also adds his ultra-cool action sequences.  Seeming to not be restricted by the PG-13 rating, he makes his fight scenes almost like a ballet, and his trademark ""violence as poetry"" is better than ever. The unbelievable motorcycle chase was exciting and fun, in that James Bond-esque implausible way. The love scenes that spark between Cruise and Newton after their car chase were very good, and nothing prompts good passion like a near-death experience. Now, while some scenes were fairly predictable (like all the masks), Woo keeps everything pretty fresh; with the exception of some of his trademarks, like the doves, the slow-motion, and the gun-play that he used to use with such candor with the god-like Chow Yun-Fat. I don't understand all the negativity that this movie has sparked, especially since this was made for pure entertainment.  It's rare that you see a movie like this that is smart as well as action-packed, and John Woo once again delivers.  I hope that his next movie, ""King's Ransom,"" will be just as intense and exciting. I definitely recommend that everyone check this film out."

","Switch off your brains and sit back and relax, 'cos this is a film that does not need any thought process whatsoever. The action comes thick and fast as Ethan Hunt virtually stages a one man battle against some Scottish bad guy who wants world domination (don't we all). The plot isn't as complex as its predecessor but who cares ??<br/><br/>If they play their cards right, a franchise as big as James Bond could be just around the corner."
"jason.sweby","9","2","3","13 July 2000"," A significant improvement on the original
","For those of you who saw the original Mission: Impossible and were, like I was, disappointed, then don't let that put you off this one.<br/><br/>I have a read a review on this site, by a girl, who disliked it because of the damsel in distress cliché - oh, please, this isn't about political correctness, and she was certainly capable of handling herself.<br/><br/>This film does use overused plots and ideas, but put that to one side and just enjoy the movie for what it is - a couple of hours of sheer entertainment, with much more professionalism and impact than the original.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is at his best in this film and is supported very well. Just don't let the clichés put you off."
"bsilva","9","2","3","15 July 2000"," Woo puts the impossible on film as no one else
","The name of the movie says it all => This is not mission difficult, this is mission impossible. It's supposed to be impossible, so why cry out that the action scenes are ridiculous and improbable (this is no wishy-washy romantic movie). Finally the right director was chosen - John Woo is the best  action director to put impossible stunts on celluloid. This is pure stunt and Cruise action (with no stunt, so they say) on its best. The movie is quite breathtaking as the camera angles in every action scene puts the spectator inside the movie (just look at the knife scene, unbelievable). If there is a Mission impossible 3, please Mr. Woo, go and direct it."
"matthew.gream","8","2","3","13 July 2000"," Very interesting post-modern hero, but a flawed implementation
","The movie is interesting for the way that it seems to create a new age Bond, however the implementation of this idea is flawed - let us hope that it can be improved in the future.<br/><br/>MI2 reads like a new age James Bond - the agent is no longer the tough and stiff upper lip martini kind of guy, but a new age relatively funky and post-modern person reflected through manner, speech, activities, attitudes and so on.<br/><br/>The movie draws on multi-culturalism, with its mix of european, australian, american and asian dimensions - the stars, directors and personnel are all from varied backgrounds, and the plot although somewhat thin, contains various cultural elements. Sydney harbour with its Miami speed boat connotations and the almost asian fight sequences are examples of this, and the south african, american, european and australian characters.<br/><br/>There are references to contemporary culture and issues: stock options and the internet (unfortunately almost somewhat tacky in its implementation), genetics and killer viruses, and corporatism, etc. The fortunicity of motorbikes on the fortress was also somewhat unbelievable, and the obligatory reference to Atlanta in relationship to Sydney in the context of the 2000 Olympics. I see the character stereotypes, they sort of work, and they are necessary because the genre is necessarily about archetypes and stereotypes, across people and society as a reflection of how it is, and where it is going right now.<br/><br/>Filmed in Sydney - my home town - I can see some sort of Australianness in it : sort of less refined, but I can also see an almost post-modernist smirnoff blending of the real and surreal in Woos freeze frame sequences. The sensuality of the lead actress and her new age beauty combined with time blurred impressionistic cinematic sensuality are very seductive.<br/><br/>I was actually disappointed, especially because there is a lot of opportunity for a good modernist version of the hero - the sort of new age global playboy rooted in a more relaxed and funky turn of the millennium lifestyle, with a new age heroic story (the ethical dilemmas facing the new world), and contemporary cinematic techniques (e.g. blurring of boundaries between time, space and reality a la smirnoff).<br/><br/>Unfortunately it almost seems as though all of this was aimed for, but just couldn't didn't 'gel' together very well -- but perhaps this is a master reflection of contemporary society in the way that it trying to gel and fuse past and the present around the millennial epoch, and how post-millennial society has yet to be fully formed.<br/><br/>This resonates particularly deeply for Australia, because as Australia searches for a multicultural identity, it adopts, combines, and mixes all manner of backgrounds into a mix that has yet to congeal.<br/><br/>Perhaps in 10 years time, this this perspective will become be apparent in retrospect."
"christina_lorell","10","2","3","12 July 2000"," The best movie of 2000
","I went to see this movie thinking that I would have to see MI to understand it.  Well, I didn't and am glad it was so different.  Ethan has really matured in the film.  We get to see a different side of him.  I really enjoyed Thandie Newton.  She is very beautiful and I don't think anyone else could have played her role.  She is a very talented actress.  Ving Rhames is great and so is Anthony Hopkins. I can't believe the negative  reviews of this film.  It is a film that allows you to simply have fun. I give this movie a 10!  I hope they have an MI3!"
"10Things","10","2","3","11 July 2000"," EXCELLENT!
","This movie was amazing. Dougray Scott was great. Tom Cruise was good. Anthony Hopkins had a funny and interesting cameo. However, the movie really belongs to Thandie Newton and John Woo. John Woo is an absolute genius. Thandie Newton is the greatest actress of our time. I am a huge fan of her, and I think she was absolutely amazing. This sequel surpasses the 'Mission: Impossible'."
"dominic-26","7","2","3","10 July 2000"," Positive on the whole
","For a lazy Saturday afternoon this was the ideal movie to watch. One of the comments. I heard before going in ""park your brain outside for this one"". All in all this was true, the plot was weak and the characters fairly two-dimensional. But this was not the reason to see the movie, no-one was going to be expecting ""Citizen Kane"". For a movie like this the main point is the action.<br/><br/>MI2 was typical John Woo, taking many of the sequences from ""Hard-Boiled"", it was a visual spectacle of the highest order. Some of the stunts were breath-taking, coupled with a great soundtrack it made sure you forgot you were sitting on horrible cinema chairs. If you are looking for a fun movie which requires no concentration, go see it."
"magis-2","10","2","3","10 July 2000"," Cruise`s face is a reason to see it...
","Not only this movie features Tom Cruise, but along with the face goes a five+ star film.  The plot is way to predicable, but instead of an original plot the scriptwriter decided to personalize the film by adding suspense, a lot of violence, and some humor and romance.  Even when I loved M:I 2, I do not think that Cruise deserved those 70 million dollars because it seems that he acted only for fourty minutes at the most, leaving the rest for a stunt and a computer."
"Andy-161","10","2","3","8 July 2000"," Mission Improbable 2 ****-
","Actually I thought this was rather good,if a little (OK a lot) far fetched but very easy plot to follow almost dumbing down compared to MI1 which was more surreal and always required close attention. It is certainly more fun that MI1 and with more than a little American James Bond feel about it with the cars the girl & the gadgets. You can tell who jointly produced it because it certainly is a slick ""Cruise"" vehicle ensuring our Mr C looks extremely good indeed at every opportunity, ie like the improbable rockface scene & slow motion shot flamenco bar scene in Portugal (or was it Spain?) I believe he did most of the stunts of which there are many. The production and soundtrack is very good, however I would have thought the visible hydraulic ram mechanism used for rolling vehicles would be digitised out by now.<br/><br/>There's a lot of shooting and MR C seems to be an amazing marksman considering the positions he gets into. It is an action (cliche) packed romp which needs to be seen on as big a screen as possible with as good a sound system as possible, If you like Mr Cruise (who seems to get better looking as he gets older, the swine) you'll love this, if you dont you'll probably still enjoy it. Dont look too deeply its not supposed to be Shakespeare although as usual I expect the stuffy intellectual types will give it a hard time, but I enjoyed it"
"HardRocker2K","9","2","3","6 July 2000"," Great Fun
","Watching this film on the big screen was great fun. Sure the film may lack in plot and character, but the performances are done well and the film works great. The action sequences are great, although at times a bit over done. Definitely John Woo's best U.S. film with Face/Off not being too far behind. Tom Cruise is great as always and Thandie Newton steals the show. If you want a great summer movie then I recommend M:I-2."
"jfavm","8","2","3","1 July 2000"," better than people are saying
","This was a fun, high action summer movie.   The critics beating this up are far too picky - the action was great, and with a little bit of ""Hollywood"" thrown in, but so what - it's a MOVIE! Plot good enough, and sometimes creative, but this was just a fun summer flick with much entertaining value."

The movie was packed with action scenes, which were very well done, and lots of suspense, which kept me interested. I suppose the main plot itself could have been better, but still this was a great film. If you've seen the first film (1996), don't let it give you a bad impression, because this one is 10 times better. A definite must see!"

I have read almost all of the reviews of this film attached to this site, I must say that I am very disappointed in the extremely negative reviews. Who are you people and why the hell do you go and see films like this when you should know before you see it you will not like it. It's not like the movie has been a big secret right until release day. Then you seem to think that we all need to read your comments on how disgusted you were with this or that or the whole thing. I have some advise for you. STAY AWAY FROM THE MOVIES. you are just some self important wannabes that think everyone wants to read your comments before going to see a movie. GET OVER IT. Why don't you guys try writing a review with some constructive criticism, Thats if you somehow think that you know how movies should be made. I am going to see it anyway, and I will bloody well enjoy it. I know what to expect... so I will enjoy it for what it is."

","While the person I was sitting next to in this film classed it as far fetched, I couldn't take my eyes away from the screen. Sydney has never looked better on film and not once was I offended by the portrayal of Australians like I often am in so many other films.<br/><br/>Cruise was excellent in his return to the role of Ethan Hunt, in fact he improved on his first attempt. I preferred the sequel to the original which is very rare. He also managed to bring back some of that 'Top Gun' charm that made us all love him back in 1986. I haven't had the urge to gawk at Cruise since 'Cocktail'.<br/><br/>John Polson was a familiar and welcome face to see on the big screen and along with Ving Rhames provided excellent comic value to an already exciting film.<br/><br/>If you're not sure about seeing this film, I would certainly recommend it. It may be far fetched but when is an Action Film ever realistic and in my opinion Mission: Impossible should never be anything but."
"Binx75075","8","2","3","21 March 2004"," Awesome Action Packed Movie!
","I definitely have to say that Mission Impossible 2 was better than the first installment! The first one was bland in my opinion and didn't have too many exciting parts. This is definitely not the case for part two. If you're into technological gadgets, then you'll definitely be interesting in this movie. There's also a semi-exciting car chase between Tome Cruise and the female lead co-star (forgot her name, sorry!) Their is a definite chemistry between the two and they seem to flow well together which does help keep the movie from being dull.<br/><br/>So, if you're debating on whether or not to see part two because you were disappointed by the first one, check it out anyways because I don't think you'll be disappointed."

","Although MI-1 struck me as astoundingly lame, Woo and Cruise team up to make MI-2 one of a rare breed; the sequel that kicks its predecessor's ass. Woo's trademark operatic visual style complements Cruise's harder edge. Cruises dead-on performance and Woo's eye for color, motion, and emotion give a thrilling snap to familiar formula.   Of course the script is loaded with physics-defying action sequences, but none of the moments of jarring stupidity that derailed MI-1.<br/><br/>If you do not expect any great depth of thought, you will undoubtedly enjoy this kinetic eye candy."

He finally returns to the insane action he had in ""The Killer"" and ""Hard Boiled"".  I was truelly impressed by the beautiful directing he did in this movie.  He seemed to kind of ease back on it in ""Face/Off"" and ""Broken Arrow"" but John is back with his stylish and crazy action.

","I saw MI-2 with five other friends last night, and I must say this is a very good film overall.  Looking at the user voting stats, a lot of people voted this movie somewhere between a 7 and 8.  And this is approximately where I would put this movie by John Woo.  Although I see a wide range of opinions on this board, from the stats I think most people agree that MI-2 is superior to the original.  Most of the criticism, I think, comes from expecting this movie to follow the original MI mix of 60% intrigue and 40% action.  MI-2 is just the opposite: 60% action and 40% intrigue.  And the action may be a little too hard-hitting and over the top for some fans. What surprised me, however, was Tom Cruise's athleticism onscreen-  (Keanu Reeves was good in 'The Matrix', but he looked stiff as a board!)  Four years ago, I saw the premier of MI at the Virgin Theaters in downtown NY, and at the end of the movie, I could see the question marks over everybody's heads.  What did we just watch?  MI-2, however, was just all applause!"
"sunny-38","10","2","3","25 May 2000"," WONDERFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!
","This movie in one of the best movies i have ever seen. It is the best work i have ever seen from John Woo. The stunts were wonderful. Tom Cruise did most of his stunts himself. That was the amazing part about it. Some stunts were just incredible, like the one when Ambrose and Tom go full speed on the motor cycle and jump on each other. Some great scenes also were when Tom goes in the building head first and when Ambrose tries to kill Tom with a Knife and the knife stops at the edge of his eyelash. Those Were great scenes.<br/><br/>The first scene of Tom Cruise Mountain climbing was breath taking. And the 30 minute motorcycle scene was just great. John Woo and Tom Cruise do it again by making a phenominal movie.<br/><br/>I cant decide which movie was better this one or Part 1 both were excellent. Makers of James Bond should watch this movie. This movie was 100 times better then their movie the World Is Not Enough.<br/><br/>The sound track of course was very good.<br/><br/>Everything in the movie was perfect except the girl, Nayah. She was real ugly and horrible. All she had was OK acting. She with Tom cruise really didnt make a good match.

This movie was not made to make you re-evaluate your life, or think about some social wrong, it was made to entertain and in regard to that, it certainly does.  The beautiful action sequences and dramatic sequences make this movie an absolute pleasure to watch.  The writing, which is done by Robert Townsend who did Chinatown, is absolutely flawless.  Tom Cruise does an amazing job at portraying who Ethan Hunt is.  It is flawlessy real and absolutely convincing.  For all who thought this movie was bad, YOU DID NOT GET IT!!!  It was not a movie that would change our lives, but, instead, a movie that would make our lives a little bit more fun.  I loved it, and for what it was I would give it a 10."
"cmmdrangelus","10","2","3","7 October 2001"," A Visual Masterpiece, Fine Action movie
","First of all let me say that to compare this film to the first Mission: Impossible would be a mistake.  Both films are different in delivery, storyline and technique. MI2 has incredible action sequences, though difficult to swallow.  But then again it's just meant to be a fun movie and if that's what you're looking for it delivers. The film completely is completely focused upon Ethan Hunt's mission.  Unlike the first one built upon intrigue and his need to clear his name, here Ethan is again the point man for his imf unit and the story completely centers around a mission to acquire a stolen item.  <br/><br/>For those who complain that this movie is focused excessively upon the character of Ethan Hunt, where it should have focused on the team aspect, i can only say that i don't really understand the complaint.  Hunt is the point man, team leader, whatever you choose to call him and as such the other members of his team take on a supporting role which i think Ving Rhames again captured perfectly.  Even in the first one most of the action centers around Hunt as his entire team is killed a few minutes into the picture. <br/><br/>Going back to the film the assault on Biocyte sequence is the highlight of the movie providing great action sequences with a killer score product of Hans Zimmer.  This is not an intellectual movie but it has a nice story line that provides an excuse to be entertained by action and more action and incredible visuals.  Even the most unbelievable stunts in the final fight between Ambrose and Hunt are easily forgiven as they visually stun the viewer and are carried out so effectively that you can just sit back and enjoy."

"russ_beer","9","2","3","25 March 2001"," Action packed stunt spectacular!!
","Tom Cruise is fantastic in this super sequel which i think is better than the original. Dougray Scott is an inspired casting choice as Sean Ambrose, and the action moves at an alarming pace. John Woo destroys the slow moving sequences of the first film and turns it into an all-out spectacular of explosions, gymnastics and stunts.<br/><br/>The plot retains some of the confusing twists that the first one had so many of, but overall theres not much to think about... its just good eye candy, if you want an action extravaganza then this is your film. Just dont expect too much of the story."

","A lot of people wanted to see another kick-ass movie. And they got what they expected. But people who wanted more than that, looked very disappointed. Because: ...It was too cliche.....he survives everything.....the only thing that was different from James Bond was that there was no character who was called James Bond.....etcetera.<br/><br/>But, Everyone!!!!! Watch the way Woo does it! Of course there were cliche's but look at how he exaggerated them. I was sitting in the cinema with a huge smile on my face. Just watch the little things carefully. Look at the little symbolic points, e.g. the white dove that is flying into the room through before Tom Cruise walks in. And later on the dove is sitting next to him on a bar. But more exciting than this, the scene with the motorcycle is unbelievable good. Of course it is an cliche and of course it is inhuman what he does, but Woo knows that too. But the good thing is that Woo let's you see that he knows. Just those scenes and symbolics are making this movie worth to watch. Not only for the kicks, but also for the real good fun."

"Beard_Of_Serpico","6","1","1","13 April 2020"," Not the best in the series but still a decent spy/action movie.
","I love the Mission Impossible series and MI2 is probably the weakest one but i don't think that makes it a bad movie.
it's directed by John Woo who is a master of action cinema. Watch Hard Boiled, The Killer, Bullet in the head and Face Off to see his over the top, balls to the wall action movies. I just don't think his style really works in an American spy thriller as the slower more dialogue heavy moments are full of exposition and cartoonish moments. John Woo's movies are more theatrical in tone and it doesn't really work here, it comes off as a bit silly.
There had to be some kind of studio meddling because you can tell the violence was toned down in editing as well. It's rated a 15 in the UK but i reckon it's more like a 12A.
Even so i still enjoy this movie for what it is, there's strong performances by everyone, lots of cool high tech spy gadgets, decent action with some awesome stunts and you can see the start of Tom Cruise taking risks to make these movies as he performs a lot of the bike stunts and kung fu himself(As far as i can tell). There's also a pretty breathtaking rock climbing scene at the beginning of the movie.<br/><br/>The series really took off from Mission Impossible 3 onwards but this is still a fun action thriller, not brilliant but i have seen MUCH worse movies which other people claim to love and praise."

","Whereas Mission Impossible made Ethan Hunt interesting, Mission Impossible 2 does not. This film is a mess for me for a number of reasons. A cliched plot, similarities to James Bond, and OH MY GOD THE SLO-MO SHOTS. Right off the bat, this film is a drastic change from the first one. It literally feels like a 2000 film. It's got that lightning and cinematography of the Brosnan bond films. Speaking of Bond, this film is very similar to a Bond film. I mean, Hunt falling in love with someone? That just screams Bond. AND CAN WE PLEASE TALK ABOUT THE SLOW MOTION SHOTS?! They are distracting in this whole movie and they are really unnecessary. Something tells me that John Woo wasn't the best director for this film. The praise I can give the film is the spectacular action sequences that Tom has done himself! The score is excellent, and it's unbelievable that Hans Zimmer made the score for this film. Overall, it's a watchable film. It's just that it's 50/50 for me on this one. If this film was like the Brosnan Bond films, this would be the ""Die Another Day"" of the series."

","""Mission: Impossible II"" follows tried to come up with something totally different from the first, but it failed to impress.<br/><br/>-Analysis of Notable Work- *Writing/Directing: The plot feels forced with twists once again, and they are not that clever. The story feels rather uninteresting. John Woo directs seemed to not be sure what he was doing with this film. It feels messy all the way through. *Cinematography/Editing: Jeffrey L. Kimball does some disappointing work in this film. Much like the previous film, it feels like a home video throughout most of it. The editing is also poor. It was not as exciting as it should have been. It was hard to get drawn into the film. *Dialogue/Acting: The dialogue is a minor improvement from the first film, but is still corny at times. The acting improves. Tom Cruise does his job again. Thandie Newton does well, but the direction makes her seem less impressive than she really is. The minor role of Anthony Hopkins is well performed. The villains are a bit more frightening than in the first film. *Music/Sound Design: The music makes this film seem a lot better than it really is. It does not match well, because the music is more intense than the events on camera, but it does make the whole production seem a bit more professional. The sound design is about the same as the first film, which means it is slightly disappointing. *Production Design/Special Effects: The sets feel too much like studio sets. They are not immersive or real feeling. The wardrobe choices are still strange, but better than the first film. The special effects improve on what the first film began, but they have a long way to go.<br/><br/>*Conclusion: ""Mission: Impossible II"" makes some improvements from the first film, but it is still a disappointment and feels too unprofessional in a lot of ways."

As it took place on a plane, the bad guys parachute away and the rest of the passengers and crew crash. Now Hunt has to get it back before it is sold to those who would use it to kill. For some reason, Hunt's bosses want him to team up with a beautiful thief, Nyah (Thandie Newton), presently in Spain.

Once a team, a romance begins, even though Ethan finds out later that she is Sean's ex- girlfriend. In fact, Nyah will have to pretend to return to her former love to make the mission work. This is dangerous territory indeed. Can Ethan and Nyah succeed? Having only seen one other MI movie, I have to say this was exciting stuff. John Woo, the director, knows how to get the pulse rate way up! Then, too, Cruise, Newton, Ving Rhames, Scott, and all of the others play cat and mouse very well.

","Well, I just reviewed the first one, so you had to know the second one was sure to follow. That is the draw of these films, every one likes them for different reasons, and as soon as you watch one, you want to see them all. Despite the old line about sequels, personally, I liked this one a lot better than the first. The story line was much closer to what I expected to see from this franchise, and this time, John Woo was Directing. I generally don't care for his writing, but when it comes to Directing action films, he's one of the best. In the second installment of Mission: Impossible, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is after a former agent, but not quite sure about what he's planning to do. As he follows the trail, Ethan learns the man has developed a deadly virus, and Ethan's mission, should he choose to accept it, is to save the day. Tom Cruise is his usual self and the action sequences are textbook John Woo, so why is this rated 3 1/2 stars you may ask? The answer is the storyline, because in a film like this, where it's all about special effects and hot bodies, the only thing that makes it different from a million other pictures is the story, and this one hits the nail on the head."
"CinematicInceptions","7","1","1","10 September 2015"," Very different from the original with much more action and a try at a story.
","This is a classic example of how sequels are often very disappointing compared to the original. That's not to say that everyone will see this as a let down after MI1, but there is an incredibly different feel from the '96 installment to the '00 one. The first movie had some action, but was primarily concerned with its plot. Granted, that plot was fairly action driven, but not so much as in MI2. The first movie had an aesthetic similar to The Hunt for Red October, while here we had more of a James Bond aesthetic.<br/><br/>The primary reason for this is the change in our protagonist, Ethan Hunt. Whereas the first film set him up as more of a Spielberg kind of hero where the situation has more control over him than he does over it, here Ethan makes active decisions and is treated more as a character. Now, on the surface that sounds like a good thing, but it entails him becoming a action hero that acts as a one man show. He has an internal conflict in his relationship with Nyah Hall (Thandie Newton), which could easily come off as underdeveloped and overblown. Nyah, a former thief, is brought in to help the IMF stop Sean Ambrose. She has some personality but if far from award-winning on the whole. Sean Ambrose is a slightly clichéd villain, and is similar to Sean Bean's role as 006 in Golden Eye since Ambrose is a former IMF agent that often used Hunt as an alter-ego. This helps make some sense of the whole mask aspect of the MI films since some people's faces are incompatible. Luther is back, but something went wrong with his character this time around. I can't quite put my finger on it, but there was something about how he was played or scripted or something that was inconsistent with the Luther from the other installments. There are a couple of other minor characters like the biocyte big wig, Dr. Nekhorvich (who is also an antagonist of sorts), Ambrose's head crony, and the IMF superior. You can tell the filmmakers tried to make the characters prominent and somewhat deep, but it didn't come out all that well.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around a synthetic virus called Chimera (the villain) and the antidote Bellerophon (the hero). Ambrose and Ethan's IMF team race to gain control of the deadly virus, and eventually Nyah injects herself with it so that Ambrose can't acquire it. Ambrose wants to spread the virus to a bunch of people so that he or whoever he's working for can sell the antidote, thus creating a hero through the creation of a villain. Like the characters, the plot attempted at depth, maybe trying to say that pharmaceutical companies are trying to play us, but ended up being action driven.<br/><br/>John Woo made this a very visually vibrant film with a lot of slow motion, often in unnecessary settings, and exotic settings like the Outback and the Spanish festival, plus that inexplicable dove that makes the beginning of the climatic scene feel like it came out of a Lego video game. Hans Zimmer's score was also exotic, and it sounded pretty good with the opera, but it's not one of his best works. The action is shot to look cool and it does, but at a cost: Ethan Hunt's invincibility mode is turned up to overdrive. The invincibility of it is not overblown like 2012 or Die Hard, but Ethan survives every battle where the odds are against him and has superior skills that we haven't seen before. The climax involves a sunglass-donning Hunt making a grand escape on a motorcycle and having a bunch of people not hit him with machine guns until he shoots them in one go with a handgun. This goes back to the new Ethan Hunt we see in this second installment, though he basically duplicates his air vent drop from the first movie. After that he proceeds to execute a bunch of motorcycle stunts. The closing fight with Ambrose was done pretty well and the slow-mo there felt called for.<br/><br/>If I haven't already stressed this enough, you will be surprised if you expect this to be similar to MI1. It's good to watch if your just looking for action. You have to pay some attention to follow the plot, but it's pretty easy to grasp overall. It may very well come off as a Bond rip-off, but 3 and 4 aren't like that in case you were wondering (rogue nation seems to follow suit in this matter, but I haven't seen it yet). I guess it's a good pick for Tom Cruise fans, but take that lightly please. So watch it for fun and with relatively low expectations to start. Overall Rating: 7.2/10."
"moviemattb","7","1","1","30 August 2015"," Fun action movie, but not a good Mission: Impossible movie
","Now after reviewing the first movie, this time, we accelerate to a sequel that many critics and fans considered this to be the weakest film of the series. However, is it the worst? Here it goes: Tom Cruise returns as Ethan Hunt goes on a mission to Sydney, Australia alongside with his IMF team as they go after a deadly virus to be destroy. Also, keeping a lookout on a thief, who happens to be in a relationship with our main villain Sean Ambrose. That doesn't sound much like a plot, don't you think? I guess that's all up to you. The plot I will admit isn't as interesting as the plot from the first one as that one was trying to be more of a mystery movie. This one, however, its just pretty much a simplistic plot with plenty of action. I don't mind plots being simple, but it would've been something if it has a plot that is actually more interesting. Aside the plot for being weak, the plane from the opening scene of the movie is purely CG, and it really doesn't look good at all; at least the bird went through a fire (also CG that appears toward the end) doesn't look as bad as the plane. Thandie Newton does an OK job for her performance, but her character isn't as compelling as any other female leads that I've seen in movies. So those were the issues, but is there anything good? Yes, there is. I thought Tom Cruise does a great job for reprising his role, and really is good for doing his own stunts. I love how he was introduce, during the opening scene where he is rock climbing. Also, him rock climbing is all done for real. Kudos to Cruise and the filmmakers for filming that scene for real instead of filming it on a set. Dougray Scott does a fine job for playing a villain, but don't find him to be complex enough. Nevertheless, I have fun watching him. The rest all did fine. John Woo's direction is actually not that bad at all. He does a fantastic job on the action scenes, and also knowing where to point the camera at. Moreover, on the action scenes, they're exciting to watch and really love the final confrontation between Ethan Hunt and Sean Ambrose. Hans Zimmer's music is very different than Danny Elfman's, but I love his arrangement on the theme song and how he provides his own take of the music for the movie. When I hear the guitar riffs, I just go flat out crazy because it makes you want to rock out. I love the look of Australia as it was being filmed. Also, never I find this to be boring. Sure the plot is weak, but I can just put this movie in and enjoy it for its mindless entertainment. All in all, its a John Woo movie and he has own unique style on making this movie. It may be the weakest film of the series, but I don't think its actually the worst that I've ever seen. Overall, ""Mission: Impossible II"" is a fun action movie, but not a good ""Mission: Impossible"" movie. I give it a 7 out of 10."
"robsta23","7","1","1","30 July 2015"," At Least It's Less Pretentious
","One thing I couldn't stand about the first Mission: Impossible is how it was trying to seem really complex - especially with the motif of the bible verse and how Ethan Hunt inexplicably knew how to contact his enemy - when it was really just a simple action film. This film is simple and knows it, making it easier to just enjoy for the ride. Sometimes simplicity (at least in plot) is just more fitting, and I think it is the case for this franchise of movies.<br/><br/>The plot is literally just what the plot section on this movie's IMDb page says, so there you have it. Once you get past that you can enjoy the film.<br/><br/>As in the first film, I'm not sure how the filmmakers pull off the sequences involving the elaborate masks, but it is a pretty brilliant effect whether it is CGI (when they remove the mask) or if it is an actual mask - it is so hard to tell. One plot hole though for this movie: how do the enemies have the exact same elaborate- mask-making technology as the spy agency which Ethan Hunt works for?<br/><br/>I find this film a little more fun than the first, but it is also filled with more clichés in my opinion. We have a woman on Hunt's side acting as a double agent to gain the villain's trust, we have villains who want to create an epidemic for profit (granted I don't know when this story element originated) and there is almost too much slow motion used in this movie - and it's the type where they didn't even to bother trying to put it into 24fps as modern slow- motion works in film.<br/><br/>An okay action film just barely better than the first, which doesn't say much. I hope I'll enjoy 3 and 4 more when I rewatch them - I had never seen numbers 1 and 2 before, strange I know."

","Mission: Impossible II is a decent movie with a reasonably well developed plot and a talented cast. It is certainly nothing outstanding, simply an enjoyable action movie with some great intense scenes and a story that is both fun and easy to watch. Tom Cruise still hits it out of the park as Ethan Hunt, his on screen charisma makes the movie worthwhile. <br/><br/>The film plays it very safe. There is really nothing bold throughout, every single stunt, every last piece of dialogue is a typical action movie cliché. It never tries to be anything special and because of that, never stands out. <br/><br/>The very plot itself is flawed, there are many questionable points throughout and it drags on. It is not as straight forward and easy to follow as the first film was, instead it tends to be overly complicated, making sure the audience have difficulty understanding so that they will not manage to discover they made a poor plot. <br/><br/>As far as actions go, it is mindless fun. Imperfect, Mission: Impossible II is still an enjoyable action, worth the watch if you ever see it on television, but certainly do not go out of your way to see it. <br/><br/>Ethan Hunt is sent on his next big mission where he must find and also destroy a genetically modified disease.<br/><br/>Best Perfornance: Tom Cruise"

The story moves along when Hunt selects two technological specializers to get the job done. A mysterious thief (Thandie Newton), whom recently had a relationship with Sean, was also asked to get the 'inside scoop' on the outcomed plans of the virus. Though this motion picture lacks the ingenious storyline of the previous film (Mission: Impossible), some would say this movie makes up for this deficiency with the high-speed chases, weapon fire and hand-to-hand combat excellence.

","As an action adventure this movie was quite good. Cruise is a fantastic talent and John Woo is one of THE best action directors today. However, Mission: Impossible was never meant to be an action adventure. I grew up on the original series, easily one of my all-time favorite series. The show didn't insult the viewers intelligence. Each episode the agents were given a mission, usually to retrieve some information, person, or object, or by neutralizing a threat, and they would do it by conning the bad guys in to screwing themselves over. The action in the original series was very low key, like in real life if the agents had to pull a gun then the mission was effectively blown. It was a smart drama and Mission Impossible 2 wasn't. If a movie is going to be made based on a TV series it should be more loyal to the series."

It keeps you on your toes, though at times very predictable,  it never lets up on the action.  His new leading lady, Thandie Newton, could have been a 'bond-girl'.  She is stunning throughout the film and never let Tom steal a scene (which is deserving of mention alone).<br/><br/>If you enjoyed the action of Mission Impossible you will enjoy this.  The beautiful cities of Seville and Sydney host the majority of the movie but the highlight has to be the special effects and the captivation of the cast.<br/><br/>I hate to compare the fight scenes to those of the matrix but the similarities are obvious.  The motorcycle scene that you have seen on the commercial is but one scene that pushes the envelope of reality.  Although some of the sequences may be computer enhanced, it is also obvious that the choreography was exceptional.  Not to mention the fact that Mr. Cruise has done a little training.<br/><br/>Right from the second scene, you will be on the edge of your seat as Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) hangs from the edge of a cliff.

Face/Off, which I would have to write a book on to do it justice, makes up for the unlikely central conceit with an almost Greek-tragic view of humanity and sin.

In the first film, which is better but not as much fun, at least you got some sense of his betrayal by Jon Voigt and the IMF. Here, the IMF are great again, with only Anthony Hopkins' misogynistic comments showing any kind of negativity. But, to be fair, Cruise does a fine job as an action hero, although not quite as great as Willis in Die Hard, Keanu in The Matrix or Cage in Face/Off. You don't really care all that much. Thandie Newton's OK, but it's a bit convenient as to how she doesn't infect anyone else with the virus. Dougray Scott....well, he's a different kind of British baddie. I prefer the upper-class, Jason Isaacs/Alan Rickman types, but still.<br/><br/>So, does it seem any good. Hell no. Is it good? Hell yeah! Why? Because of the last 45 minutes, which top Face/Off and The Matrix comfortably, in the sheer hysterically OTT Woo-isms. Remember the shoot-out in the loft in Face/Off? Well, there's one of those in a chemical weapons facility, with the obligatory huge body count. There's a scene where Cruise infiltrates the baddie's hideout, a la any Bond film, but the Bond films didn't have a scene where Bond blows a door open...and SENDS IN A DOVE!!!! It's a fantastically stupid bit, and sums up the entire film. Woo is an absolute genius at the stupidly baroque, operatic and theatrical and MI2 is a perfect example of all this.<br/><br/>And then there's the bike chase (best ever on film) and the final mano a mano showdown (one of the best on film- it's all real!). And then Cruise catches a gun in mid-air, kills Scott, saves Thandie Newton and the film ends. The audience, over and over again, jumps up and down. It is a brilliant example of how, with a genius filmmaker like Woo, a rubbish plot matters not. Yeah baby!"

","Not satisfied of completing the first 'Mission Impossible"", agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) gets engaged for yet another impossible task - that of recovering a lethal virus from the bad guys before they let it loose in downtown Sydney.<br/><br/>This second Mission Impossible has an altogether different feel from the first one.  The plot in the first MI movie was a bit too complicated for many people's likings.  This time round, the plot is as simple and as straight forward as they get.  Unlike the first movie, there are no hidden sub-plots, no mysteries to solve, and it is not overly-demanding on the average person's brain cells.<br/><br/>The stolen virus in question, which resembles a deadly form of influenza and manifests itself within 20 hours of contact is snatched by Sean Ambrose, an ex-collegue of Hunt.  In order to recover the stolen virus, Hunt recruits Nyah (Thandie Newton), a professional thief ""without a conscience"" in order to try and use her allure on Sean and recover the deadly potion.  The obbligatory whizz-kid and heli pilot are also called into action, however their presence in the movie is very limited.  TOO limited, in fact.<br/><br/>Alas, the film's greatest flaw is that it concentrates too much around Tom Cruise.  The rest of the cast remains in the shadows for most of the film.  Also, the oh-so-important team work factor between the MI squad members seems missing.<br/><br/>That said, the film boasts some really spectacular shots and sceneary of the Australian countryside, James-Bond style gadgets and special effects plus the usual mask dilemma....is that really THAT person or is it his enemy wearing a super-sophisticated mask?

It told a compelling story about a complicated mole hunt and paid off.  This film is a typical James Bond type story about a deadly virus falling into the wrong hands.  Cruise is under developed as Ethan Hunt, Thandie Newton is just another pretty love interest with no stamina in her own character and director John Woo stages the action scenes like television commercials for fast motorcycles and advertisements for movie theme park rides.  Truly a dismal and flat action picture that even uses Anthony Hopkins in a limited cameo to market its presence and make audiences think that two stars like Hopkins and Cruise can't fail.  Yes, they can!  At least like all bad sequels, it made me appreciate the original a whole lot more."

Oh yes, she's saved by all the valiant men at the end, have no fear. Why is it that John Woo thinks he's making powerful moral statements when in fact he's only making a flaccid action flick?

I know he does it well, but he does it so much here. One fight scene near the end is intolerably long and, yes gratuitous, even for a John Woo work.

Forget the bad reviews, go in with a blank mind, don't complain about lack of story or drama, not that it doesn't have any, but this isn't GOODFELLAS, HEAT, FIGHT CLUB OR THAT RUBBISH AMERICAN BEAUTY, AWFUL ROMEO AND JULIET AND COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY TITANIC!!

If you like action movies, with guns, explosions, death defying stunts, retina scorching special effects and spectacular directing that oozes style and creativity....then see this movie now!!  Stop reading this review and go to the biggest cinema with the biggest screen and the loudest surround speakers!! But if you're still here, let me expand. The first M:I's story was boring and it had a strong european feel to it, which made it very dull indeed. M:I 2 however is something else, it is the summer mega blockbuster hit of SUMMER 2000, bar none. The first thing you notice about the movie is it's unique contemporary, hi-tech and stylish colour pallete and image. It's a feast for the eye's. O.k, so you get past the plane crash, and the jaw dropping cliff climb, which apart from sending you wide-eyed, kicks off a spectacular masterpiece of a soundtrack...and it only gets better. Then comes a lovely flamenco dance, also carrying a hammering soundtrack, brilliantly shot and edited. Car chase, slow motion, bed scene, ANTHONY HOPKINS, a great addition, injects a little humour...Then you get plot developement with lots of dilouge. Wait for it.....Then ACTION, GUNS, EXPLOSIONS SPARKS STAND-OFF'S, all of which convey waves of emotion, not only by the exvellent musical score but the stylish directing and camera work. The stronghold break-in and bike chase and the stylish finale will leave you breathless, wide-eyed gasping for air, because you stopped breathing during certain parts, like when a blade comes down on ethun hunt's eye and stop millimetres above his pupil. Everyone in the cinema screamed and gasped and shouted because it was shot so well, that there was a great, actual sense of horror, surprise, shock and most of all excitement. That painted a massive smile to my face. some people and critics say it was dull in the middle....NOT TRUE!! It was full of plot developement and the whole movie had loads of great twist in it... i won't spoil it for you. This is a must own and must see movie which will make an essential edition to any video cabinet or collectors shelf. saying that, i wouldn't mind owning it on VHS at all, as long as it was the wide-screen version, but...IT'S GONNA BE ABSOLUTELY MIND-BLOWING ON DVD. If you haven't got a DVD player, get one now just to own this movie when it is released. I simply can't put it all in words.....see it!!If you're looking for any other movie which possesses the same style, visual and emotional impact of M:I 2 then you won't find any other, except if it's directed by John Woo, I recommend HARD BOILED, and THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS is good too.<br/><br/>ENJOY, AND WELCOME TO ENTERTAINMENT AS IT SHOULD BE."

"Drooch","8","1","1","6 July 2000"," Superb
","This is an incredible piece of entertainment. Perhaps people attack it because it fails to meet certain expectations that one might associate with a 'Mission Impossible' film, and as a sequel it hardly remains very faithful to the prequel.<br/><br/>Taken for what it is - a non-stop thrill ride of poetic action sequences filled with beautiful music, stunning cinematography, sexy stars and plot surprises - it cannot be faulted. If, on the other hand, none of this appeals to you then you should not expect to enjoy MI:2, but at least give it credit for succeeding in its intentions.<br/><br/>John Woo's visuals blend harmoniously with Hans Zimmer's etherial score throughout the entire movie and it becomes apparent that this is a real work of art, it just happens to be packaged in the 'Mission Impossible' framework. This framework generates expectations. My advice is to let go of your expectations and focus on what this film is trying to do, and you will not be disappointed."
"rdarlington","Null","1","1","8 July 2000"," Triumph of style over substance - but what style
","When I saw the original Brian de Palma `Mission: Impossible' in 1996, I found the plot confusing but the action sequences thrilling  and I especially enjoyed the Prague locations (because I know the city so well). In the case of `M:I 2', there is very little plot, but  thanks to director John Woo  (`Broken Arrow' and `Face/Off') - the action scenes are even  more explosive  and even more visceral with some superb stunts and a pounding soundtrack. I could have done without the repeated use of a particular prosthetics trick, but the thrilling final bike chase sequence is vintage Woo and worth the admission price alone. <br/><br/>This time round, we have a very different Tom Cruise as Impossible Missions Force agent Ethan Hunt: he looks different, with his long hair flaying all over the place; he fights differently, displaying flying drop kicks at every opportunity; and he feels differently, almost immediately falling in love. Cruise can act, as we know from `Magnolia', but here his thespian talents are not really needed, but then the guy did do virtually all his own stunts and he was co-producer, so I suppose he deserves his rumoured 30% share of the profits. <br/><br/>I would like to have seen half British half Zimbabwean Thandie Newton (`Beloved'), as both the agent and the villain's love interest, given a more physically resourceful role and the great Anthony Hopkins is sadly underused  although he does have the best lines  as the head of the IMF. At least the Scottish Dougray Scott is suitably chilling as the renegade with an original use for his cigar cutter.  <br/><br/>The critics have been pretty cynical about this movie  `More Tom foolery with Mr Cruise' and `Cruising on empty' were just two of the British headlines  but, when I saw the film on its opening weekend at the largest cinema in London (the Empire Leicester Square), every performance that evening was sold out and, at the end of my showing, the audience actually applauded. Sure, it's a triumph of style over performance  but what style. And, if you've had a tough week at work (as I had), it's a terrific antidote."

","If you choose to evaluate Mission Impossible 2 on it's combined merits as a intelligent piece of contemporary cinema you will be disapointed. That is because this is Dead Poets Society or something of that vain - it is a action movie.<br/><br/>When I first emerged from M:I-2 I was disapointed, I thought the story was unimaginative and the twists a little repetitive, but I couldn't really fault the action or the production - I mean there were a few little impossibilities, but I believe is suspension of disbelief, so I let that slide.<br/><br/>If you view this movie for what it is - a fast-paced, formula-based, Tom Cruise action flick - then it is good. The music is good, the stunts are great, the cinematography is excellent. Mission Impossible 2 may not be a 'good movie' but it is definitely a good action movie.<br/><br/>

","There was no Impossible Mission. This was just a vehicle for Tom Cruise' ego. I remember the original MI series (And the first half of the first movie) being about a 'Team' of people, all experts in particular skills, who would come together and, as a 'Team' would tackle an 'Impossible' mission.<br/><br/>This was nothing like either the series, or even MI-I. Ethan Hunts 'Team' consisted of a communications expert who loses contact with him, an Australian (Presumably cast because it was filmed here) helicopter pilot and an internationally notorious thief who couldn't even pick a pocket properly.<br/><br/>Action fans won't be too disappointed as Mr Hunt manages to kill all the bad guys from every manner of impossible position and situation whilst defying both gravity and physics. Fortunately in order to accomplish this he has acquired a gun that never needs reloading or cleaning and that is magically attached to his hand by an invisible force.<br/><br/>Most filmgoers will be disappointed though as this movie is filled with clichés, bad acting from most of those with more than 10 minutes screen time, scenes copied from other movies and total plot cop outs.<br/><br/>In conclusion I would say that after the success of MI-I Mr Cruise & Woo saw us coming.<br/><br/>5/10"
"Joe S.","9","1","1","26 May 2000"," A visual delight, though I'm finding few people agree
","I understood the plot of the original movie, though it would take too many words on here to explain.  However, the movie was too locked into a European coffee-house look that may work great for an intellectual character study, but drains the excitement from a spy thriller.  What immediately makes this movie better is the location.  Australia is a breath of fresh air from most cramped in hotel room espionage games, though the conventional car chase and horse race present themselves here-and-there.  The plot is a bit simple, but then again, it isn't completely spelled out either.  Exciting action sequences are laced throughout the movie, especially one break-in sequence that while not having as large of a scope of the original's break-in, provides astounding visuals especially of downtown Sydney.  The parts in between may have been a complete bore (and to some, they were), but two things saved them for me.  The first is John Woo's visual style.  While some may say it's self-centered direction, the movie provides many stunning visuals to push the emotional levels.  A scene where Agent Hunt first meets a female thief who must be recruiting for the mission, the camera plays tricks with their gazes and the spinning of Spanish dancers.  While too flashy for some tastes, it breathes life into a scene that by any other director's hands would be simply two people looking at each other.  The second is Hans Zimmer's wonderful score.  Though sometimes falling to the ""give the people what they want"" flair of Lalo Schifrin's Mission:Impossible theme, the rest of score is surprisingly emotional.  Since there are some points that lack chemistry between the characters, the music is key to the success of the movie.  The sensual yet rousing themes make the audience care about the characters without pushing the them into it.  Put it all together and it's an exciting movie that kept me involved from beginning to end, even if the lack of just one of above elements would make the movie fall apart."

'M:I-2' in comparison is no comparison. Hong Kong action director John Woo completely rescues the series like his name was Clark Kent. With his masterful control of the moment, and his flair for the semi-insane, he takes audiences on a two-hour joyride that they will never forget. Tom Cruise is awesome as always, reprising his role from the original as Ethan Hunt, an IM agent off to save the world, this time from a deadly virus by the name of Chimera. Dougray Scott plays a convincing villain by the name of Sean Ambrose, who hopes to hold the world ransom by releasing this virus and being the only one in the world with the cure.

Fourth, the sexual politics are SO BAD: damsel is sexually exploited, pathetically ineffective, helplessly vulnerable, and in desperate need of rescue. Yuk.<br/><br/>
In spite of all this, some of the scenes are filmed so beautifully, I gasped. The beginning scene in Utah, for instance: fantastic. The car chase between Tom Cruise and Thandie Newton, which transmutes into a tango dance: immensely creative and sensual. The motorcycle chase towards the end: breath-taking. Also, John Woo manages to capitalize beautifully on Tom Cruise's amazing screen charisma, to stunning effect. And he bends the M I trademark mask pealing to his penchant for identity swapping (see Face/Off, which could be the title of this film too), introducing some valuable thought-provoking elements into a script that doesn't seem to offer any to start with. Finally, I ALWAYS enjoy the bird/dove scene, a John Woo signature that expresses redemption and beauty magnificently. Terrific cinematography and amazing stunts. <br/><br/>So, in conclusion, I loved this film. And I'll go see everything John Woo does. But he should try to work on his female characters."
"Kipple Master","9","1","1","6 June 2000"," Interesting, Fun and Just Plain Great
","This movie is a lot like Face/Off (1997) (also directed by John Woo). An action packed thrill ride which takes a little while to get started. It keeps you interested and alert. What happens between the beginning and the end is very hard to predict, the ending, however is exactly what I expected (Just like in Face/Off).<br/><br/>Overall it's worth the money you pay to see it, just don't believe the reviews in the newspapers which say it has no plot (in Australia anyway) because it has a great plot with plenty of twists and turns, and of course intense action. 9/10."
"drbryan","8","1","1","6 June 2000"," Great action movie...and better than MI One!
","What do people go to action adventure movies for? For a sophisticated human drama? NO. For a mind-numbing twisting-turning plot? Well maybe. In MI 2, you get neither of the above, but you do get a lot of action, stunts, great karate scenes, unbelievable motorcycle stunts, and a real good (I mean bad) bad guy.<br/><br/>Nyah Nordolf-Hall is new to me, but she is a real beauty. Excellent facial expressions, and gorgeous eyes. The Aussie side-kick has a small role, but he's a funny guy. Ving Rhames was definitely underutilized. This movie was about TOM CRUISE.<br/><br/>If you're comparing to the TV series, there is one scene you will really enjoy.<br/><br/>Overall, I really enjoyed MI2. The plot was mostly simple and predictable, but there were a few times where I thought that I knew what was going on but my wife did not, so the surprise elements really worked.<br/><br/>The final fight scene is not to be believed, but it sure was fun to watch! Hope you enjoy MI2."
"Baja-4","9","1","1","5 June 2000"," Very, very slick!!!
","I just rented M:i 1 before going to see the sequel.  In a word, the test of a good movie is whether or not it is good after 5 years. M:i 1 was cheesy, super cheesy.  M:i-2 made it all worth it!!! I loved everything about M:i-2, sure it is not plausible, but it is extremely entertaining.  Exactly what you want from a summer action flick: great stunts and action, minimal corny jokes, and a plot line you can follow.  M:i-2 had all ingredients in abundance with a kick butt soundtrack and ear spliting sound effects. It's all here in M:i-2, worth every dime."
"dawg-15","10","1","1","5 June 2000"," Overall pretty good;
","but it wasn't nearly up to the first movie.  For instance in both movies you had the drops; in the first one it was into the mainframe at Langley and you had to wonder if he was going to make it in and out.  In this one it was into a vent shaft and he was dropping prior to it opening.  Obviously you knew it would open; you can't have the hero going splat halfway through the movie.  It's that kind of thing that kept it from being as exciting a movie as the first one.  In addition John Woo uses way too much slow motion and way too much martial arts in it."
"rux-2","9","1","1","4 June 2000"," Changing the meaning of the word ""impossible""....
","From the very beginning it seem to be a good movie. And to be honest, it was. It`s is true....it felt like it was getting a little ""slow"" around the midlle of the movie, but that didn`t last for long. Before I got to write this, I have read a few reviews and a few comments by others....and I got to say it: many people don`t know what they want. The 1st M.I. was too slow, complicated and it lack in action. The 2nd M.I 2 looks like a story written for a 6 years old. PEOPLE, make up your mind !!! JOHN WOO  is the best as far as directing action movies. Has the talent for it and he`s very ingenious...and for ALL those people out there, who think that JOHN WOO ""took"" some ideas from ""THE MATRIX"", with the slow-motion, let me bring you up to date. The slow motion scenes in the movie, directed by JOHN WOO, are pretty much his ""trade mark"" or his ""signature""... ""THE MATRIX"" was nowhere when ""THE KILLER"" or ""HARD BOILED"" came out, all of them directed by JOHN WOO. So, think about it....If you`ll ever watch one of those movies, you`ll see the ""signature""....and even in JOHN WOO`s latest movies (but movies that were made before ""THE MATRIX"") like HARD TARGET, BROKEN ARROW, FACE OFF....you`ll see all that. Second: the two MISSION IMPOSSIBLE movies were directed by totally different directors. The 1st M.I. was the work of BRIAN DePALMA, one of the best directors when in comes down to thrillers and mystery. So, you got less action but more mystery. The 2nd MISSION IMPOSIBLE was directed, as we all know already, by the one of the best action movie directors: JOHN WOO. So, you got less mistery and more action. If you didn`t like that, you can go back and re-watch the 1st one and if you didn`t like the 1st either then maybe you should be watching ""ALICE IN WONDERLAND."" However, after watching the movie, I got the feeling that the ""masks"" were used every time they got to a ""dead end"" with the script. But that would be pretty much the only thing I could say against the ""M.I.2"" This is definitely one of those movies you got to have, if you a movie collector."
"amykay","8","1","1","24 May 2000"," M:I with Kick!
","Tom Cruise and John Woo deliver on their promise to bring you Mission Impossible with Kick (or, kicks, shootouts, sliding shootouts, sliding car chases, high cliffs, sweaty palms, and tight editing)!  Like a gift to all us Gen X'ers and the Baby Boomers who grew up with the original Mission Impossible -- this is the way it was meant to be.  The first one pales in comparison."
"evilsithlord","7","1","1","5 June 2000"," A good, yet a little mindless action movie.
","This was a pretty decent movie. The story was only ok and the love story sucked, but action was outstanding. I usually don't like movies that is basically carried by its action but this was really damn good. I won't begin to compare it to movies like ""Life is Beautiful"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"" but it is a nice movie if you want to see explosions and some edge-of-your-seat-action. Just don't see this if you want to walk away thinking, ""That better win an Oscar."" However, if you just want to say, ""Ooh,"" and ""Ah"" at some nice action, this will not disappoint."

","Great movie!  While this ""episode"" did not have the twists and turns as its predecessor - in fact, this one was rather predictable all along the way - the action and story kept me hanging on until the very end.  MI2 rates about a low medium on the 'blood/guts/gore' scale.  Certainly worth the time to watch!"
"trut","8","1","1","3 June 2000"," Well executed action film. It certainly was impossible.
","I think that this movie achieves what it has set out to achieve.  After all, the heroes are supposed to do things that look impossible.  The stunts are supposed to be over the top.  And they were.<br/><br/>John Woo lends an experienced hand to direct this action movie, providing an alternative to the expected.  Some scenes, such as the ""white dove and fire"" shot, may have seemed a little hackneyed, seemingly irrelevant in a film with little other symbolism.  Tom Cruise's rock-climbing and motorcycle-riding was nothing short of amazing, and the stunts in general were extremely far-fetched - brilliant."
"AFRO PUFF","8","1","1","3 June 2000"," Good overall, but something's missing...
","No doubt that this is a good movie.  The script is a bit too predictable.  It needed more plot twists and surprises. <br/><br/>Action was great, but most action sequences ended prematurely.  If you are a fan of John Woo, you can tell that the action was toned down to get a PG-13 rating.  Rumor has it that Woo and Cruise both loved the original cut, but it would have received an R rating.  Around twenty minutes of violence was cut out.  Those twenty minutes would have been pure bliss for a John Woo fan!  Hopefully that original version will resurface on the DVD (hint...hint... if they didn't make the DVD yet).  Great movie otherwise, but the possibilty of the full version leaves a person unsatisfied with the theaterical release."
"Shevy","9","1","1","2 June 2000"," Extremely Entertaining

If you want a sophisticated plot with maximum realisticness (which is pretty rare in any movie these days) go see something else. If you are going to be picky about the unrealisticness or lack of plot depth you aren't going to like it and you'll be wasting your time, Go to be entertained."

The team thing is missing, the first one is not perfect too for this point, but at least Brian de palma had try.  The only thing cool in that movie was the unbelievable bike chase. My rate 6/10."
"ruud-11","9","1","1","2 June 2000"," This movie is one BIG adrenaline-pump.
","I expected a lot from all the trailers when I went to see MI2, and was I satisfied? Beyond that point, I even got more than I expected.<br/><br/>
MI2 is one of the best action movies I have ever seen, director John Woo is of course THE action-movie director of all time, and if this movie doesn't prove that, nothing will. The perfectly timed slow motion shots that are Woo's trademark add greatly to the overall movie experience and the camerawork is simply outstanding.<br/><br/>Besides John Woo, the second insurance for top-class filming is leading actor Tom Cruise. His acting in this movie is in one word superb. His character, Ethan Hunt, is a pro, he's cool, he's sensitive and definitely unstoppable...who said James Bond was the action hero of all times? Better hope that there will be no successor to MI2 if good ol' James wants to keep<br/><br/>that title, Ethan Hunt is a serious competitor. Ving Rhames returns in this movie as Hunt's computer-expert just like in MI1, and Rhames somehow adds something to every movie he has played in lately. A surprise to me was Anthony Hopkins co-starring in this movie as Hunt's boss, pretty neat, Hopkins rules :) and his no1 quote for this movie would have been description enough!<br/><br/>""This is not mission: difficult Mr.Hunt, this is mission: impossible, mission: difficult should be a walk in the park for you.""<br/><br/>In short: this movie is a must-see for every action movie fan, and try to remember when you walk out the theatre, don't kill the first suspicious guy you see...it's a movie!"

"Benoir-2","8","1","1","1 June 2000"," Tom Cruise is back in a good, but not great sequel to the 1996 original.
","Tom Cruise returns as Ethan Hunt in Mission Impossible 2. Ving Rhames is back as well. They are joined by Thandie Newton, Dougray Scott, Richard Roxburgh, John Polson and an unbilled Anthony Hopkins and directed by action-master John Woo.<br/><br/>The bad guys, Scott and Roxburgh steal a virus and the cure and try to sell it to a pharmaceutical company for stock. They then plan to release the virus and make a lot of money selling the cure. It's up to Ethan Hunt and his IMF team to stop him.<br/><br/>And that's pretty much the extent of the plot, which takes an unbelievable amount of time to get going(almost 70 minutes). But then it's on for young and old as Woo lets loose for a solid 45 minutes of non-stop action, involving gun-play, motorcycle chases, explosions, hand to hand combat and, of course, Woo's trademark doves.<br/><br/>The first hour of M:I2 is a little slow, with a sub-plot trying to build a romance between Cruise and Newton and the masks featured in the 1996 original are back in abundance and are overused, often confusing the viewer as to what is actually going on. Whenever there's a plot twist that needs to be explained either Cruise or Scott just put on a mask. IMF is only briefly referred to at the beginning and even though Ethan Hunt has their full support he still seems to be on his own. Even with a screenplay from Robert (Chinatown) Towne, poor plotting is the biggest downfall of M:I2.<br/><br/>If you can get past this you can really enjoy yourself. No one does action better than Woo and although Rhames is pretty much wasted, Scott makes an interesting villian, and Cruise is an athletic and charismatic hero, and you really appreciate it when you see that it is actually Cruise doing the majority of his own stunts.<br/><br/>But the real star here is Sydney and even though there are too many establishing shots of the Opera House and the harbour bridge it looks beautiful. A great advertisement for Australia as a holiday and film making location.<br/><br/>Although not the best of the summer blockbusters(Gladiator is leading the pack so far) M:I2 is very enjoyable and definately worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>4 out of 5."
"davebgray","8","1","1","1 June 2000"," Entertaining, enjoyable, and cool.
","MI2 isn't the best movie out there, but what do you expect from another summer blockbuster?  MI2 is, however, extremely entertaining.  It is far fetched just like many action movies, with bullets a-plenty, but if that's what you're going for, MI2 is well done.  Jon Woo's directing style is very present (with slow-motion, quiet action sequences), and it fit's the mood perfectly.  The movie also is fair to the spy element of the series. Overall, I didn't walk out of the film a changed man, but I was jumping around and battling my friends on the way out to the car."
"wupi","9","1","1","4 June 2000"," Great great great action!!
","I was wondering from all the other comments that would it be different if Tom Cruise was not in this movie? maybe it's because you keep seeing Tom's image in your head after we see this movie...ugghh,you'll see!!<br/><br/>
Anyway I must BOW on my head & knees to JOHN WOO who had delivered adding this new style of Mision Impossible, very refreshing , I must say some parts are unpredictable, John is perfect to direct this movie. want some action? go see it!"
"pmwgreen","8","1","1","1 June 2000"," Loved this film, Woo tries to be Hitchcock, Succeeds?
","I loved this film and will go and see it again.<br/><br/>Firstly, you have to understand this film is at the very least a homage to Notorious, if not a remake. I don't know how the studio let them do it. That film, made just after WWII, is the kind of film that just doesn't get made anymore, it's not bloody enough for your average teenager. I love Hitchcock, my favorite is To Catch A Thief, and I see a lot of Hitchcock in this film. I'm sorry that so many people don't think there was enough killing in the first half of the film, but there isn't supposed to be and frankly I enjoyed it. I think Woo gets a pretty good level of thrill out of people NOT falling off cliffs, NOT getting caught in a secret meeting and shooting their way out, etc. I'm sorry there wasn't more of the sort of action seen at the race track, the slight of hand and people dodging around behind each other. People talking to each other on secret mikes while watching each other through binoculars just gives me a big grin, I don't know why. That said, I think that the original ending of Notorious is pretty lame, you almost feel sorry for Claude Rains. Woo gives us, well, a different one.<br/><br/>Secondly, and this is just my theory, the first time you see John Woo's work it hits you between the eyes. You're not quite sure what you saw, or why you thought it was so amazing, but you know you have to see more. And then it never seems quite as striking after that. It's good stuff, but you start looking at everything except the action. Lots of people seem to be complaining that they saw Face/Off and this isn't as good. Frankly, I thought Face/Off was an atrocity exhibition and not nearly as good as Broken Arrow. MI-2 has just the right mix."
"Darth_Rage","9","1","1","31 May 2000"," Mission: Excellent!!
","Its already been the 2nd time that I saw the movie within 1 week and holy cow....what a ride!  I can't wait to go the 3rd time. Being a huge fan of John Woo films, this one really hits the mark.  Sure the plot is simple but John Woo makes a great movie by not following the first one where nobody can understand the plot even if it existed at all?  But what more do you want....its a fun movie, Tom Cruise is trying to save the world, lets keep it simple and not try to continue ruin the franchise by making it like the first one.  Sure, this won't top his Hong Kong flicks such masterpieces like Hard-Boiled and The Killer.  However, I would put this movie right up there with Face/Off.  Face/Off has a great story and great action and it really introduced John Woo to the world.  However with M:I2, the John Woo trademarks really stood out with his stylish slow motion effects to capture all its action in its intensity.  Tom Cruise never looked better.  When you work with John Woo, he turns you into a hero....an action hero! Everything is great about this movie.  The right amount of action, it was so good that you just don't want it to end.  Most people might think that the John Woo trademarks are slightly over done, but some may find it very cool and stylish.  No director is the same.  Everybody has got their own style. This is a must see for the summer and a great way to start off the summer. This movie will no doubtedly pass the 100 million mark in less than 2 weeks.......quite amazing I must say!   M:I2 is a masterpiece and a milestone in film making.  Many people groan at the style of this John Woo film but its only because they don't know how to appreciate quality and original film-making.  Thats why its labeled a John Woo film.  This is for sure a film that critics will bash, but that only means its going to be a great movie.  You see, many people are just WAY TOO critical about movies, thats why they have problems enjoying movies.  Word of advice to the people who don't think they'll enjoy this movie or didn't enjoy it......watch the first M:I movie, you'll like the second one even more.  Its all there, user-friendly plot (easy to understand),  breath-taking stunts, great camera work, stylish film-making, ultra cool action sequences, Tom Cruise never looked so cool.  End the end 9/10 stars."

M:I-2 is a nonstop ride that had everything I love in a movie- a hot chick, gratuitous violence, high speed car chases, high speed motorcycle chases, crashing and burning, matrix-style fights, lots of explosions and gunfire, insane stunts involving rock climbing and base jumping to name a couple, and great shots of my home-town Sydney.<br/><br/>If you can suspend your disbelief for a couple of hours then go and see this flick. Tom Cruise and Dougray Scott both excel in their lead roles as the hero and villain.<br/><br/>The plot may not be as elaborate as the first one, some might argue that there is not even a plot at all! Anyway the stunts, fights scenes and explosions alone put this film into my top ten, up there with the Die Hard trilogy, Lethal Weapon series, and the 90s 007 flicks.<br/><br/>This is the first movie where I've enjoyed the sequel more than the original."
"Maniax","8","1","1","31 May 2000"," If you can find me a more action packed movie, tell me
","From the beginning to the end, M:I-2 was nothing short than a thrill ride. Throw in a little romance and a great actor in Anthony Hopkins and you got the whole appeal for the movie.  The movie may not have the same attitude than the first one, but it is probably the best movie sequel since Silence of the Lambs."
"shadow_fist","8","1","1","31 May 2000"," Good John Woo movie. Excellent action. Cool plot.
","My friend and I used to watch an hour of Mission: Impossible every day after school and after this movie we both agree that it is more of a ""Mission: Impossible"" movie than the first.<br/><br/>The action is quite good,  not quite as good as The Matrix but it definately has the same feel. The movie features lots of The Matrix style Ultra-SLO-MOs and gunfight sequences.<br/><br/>The music is more heavy metal in nature than the original movie but still has the Mission: Impossible ""feel"" to it. The music fits into the style of the movie perfectly.<br/><br/>As far as the plot goes it is a lot like a James Bond movie with more sneaky stuff like what was common in Mission: Impossible. If you have watched as much Mission: Impossible as I have, you may find the plot to be somewhat predictable, but the average movie-goer will find it full of of twists and turns.<br/><br/>I give it an 8, because I loved the original series, and no movie has yet done the series justice. On the other hand, Mission: Impossible 2 is an incredible movie, and deserves a high ranking. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves Mission: Impossible, James Bond, The Matrix, John Woo, or twisting plots."
"catalystpaperbag","9","1","1","1 June 2000"," better than the first
","I guess saying ""better than the first"" isn't really saying all that much considering how absolutely terrible the direction of Brian DePalma along with the lagging and occasionally incoherent script of the first film. But this one isn't bad at all. Not by a longshot. As a matter of fact, it embodies all that the past two james bond films have lacked: chemistry and involvement along with a slight unbelievability. The script is somewhat charming, although not anything totally out of the norm for your typical action film. I think we all know what really makes this film shine, although the script may be a secondary that by no means leaves it as a bad one. The true marvel? The stunts are all done and pulled off so well, you won't even find yourself thinking of how improbable it all is, if for not other reason than how wonderful it looks on screen after what appears as being so minute but must actually have been choreographed with a certain meticulous only a perfectionist like Woo embodies in the modern and fragmented Action blockbuster market. No one is really willing to take a chance anymore on action films unless they have a sure thing. I guess this was worth the large risk as Paramount has what is undoubtedly a sure-fire hit on their hands considering the lack of this type, or quality on the films released in the market at this time. <br/><br/>I remember hearing that Cruise had bought the rights to the first and all M:I sequels shortly after the first films release. I thought he was just trying to get away with not repeating the same mistake three times, as he was reportedly signed at by contract. Instead, it appears he really does demand a lot of himself after all considering what a turn over it is from its predecessor..."
"scott-151","8","1","1","31 May 2000"," Nice action movie
","Overall I thought that Mission Impossible II was a nice action movie. While it is true that MI2 deviates from the original TV series in that it is more of a single man doing all the work instead of a team.  But if you can overlook this part of the movie and not compare it to the series then you should enjoy this one.<br/><br/>John Woo includes his classic cinematography, slow-mo shots, which some people claimed were overused.  I think the slow-mo added to the scenes.<br/><br/>I also give kudos for Cruise doing his own stunts.<br/><br/>While some of the scenes where unbelievable, rock climbing scene, and motorcycle joust scene, I can't help but wonder about when movies had to be believable.<br/><br/>I do have one last thing to say.  If Ethan Hunt could exist he would beat the tar out of Bond.<br/><br/>I give this movie an 8 out of 10."
"jerzeygrl","8","1","1","22 May 2000"," It's all about the Special Effects...
","They should rename this movie ""Mission Implausible"" and flog the script writer.  The premise of the movie is based on a woman (Thandie Newton) willing to risk her life & reconnect with her bad-boy, ex-boyfriend (Dougray Scott) for a man she falls into bed with (Tom Cruise) after meeting him just 24 hrs prior.   The dialogue between the Newton & Cruise is elementary school level at best and they don't spark.  See ""Thomas Crowne Affair"" for an example of great chemistry.  You feel your eyes rolling every time the lovers make cows eyes at each other before speaking.  Look for Thandie Newton's wonderbra - it only makes one appearance.  Director John Woo uses his magic wand on Tom Cruise and tries to turn him into an American Chow Yun-Fat.  Although Dougray Scott fairs well as the progressively greedy, besotted terrorist, it's Anthony Hopkins who steals the movie with only 6 minutes of screen time.  Ving Rhames & John Polson (Cruise's IMF team) have little dialogue - shame.  The best throw-away lines are by Scott...    The magnificent performance by Tom Cruise in ""Magnolia"" is not repeated here.<br/><br/>BUT if you're a special effects, action genre junkie, this will hold you over till X-Men is released July 14."

"Einsiedeln","8","1","1","30 May 2000"," Pretty good, but...
","... it could have been a bit more believable.  In the first film, adrenaline and action was sacrificed upon the altar of (dubious and semi-comprehensible) plot and (Brian DePalma's lackluster definition of) ""style"".  Unlike many others whose posts I've read, I didn't care for M:I-1. It was slow and unstylish, despite the director's desires... and whoever did the research for the Internet sequences fubar'd them with cheesy, low-tech AOL-looking images.<br/><br/>M:I-2 had the style that the first film was missing.  Settings and technology in this film actually appeared to be slick-tech, and portions of THIS film where certain characters were breaking into high-security areas weren't handled in as poor a fashion as the first.  (Poisoned coffee? Sensors which don't register the sound of keyboard typing, which is certainly louder than a whisper?  And above all, being able to hack into CIA's security systems?  Has no one heard of a firewall?)  Where M:I-2 lost my suspension of disbelief was the numerous car explosions (those not caused by plastique, anyways), proof that all film terrorists must be buying their automobiles from Yugo.  =)<br/><br/>For the most part, M:I-2 was more coherent in style and comprehensibility, even if (or perhaps because?) it was possessed of a simpler and more linear plot than the first.  The action sequences were better conceived and filmed (it amazes me that people can be impressed by the poor-effects, yawnable ""hook the helicopter to the train"" schtick).  Overall, Woo is a far more capable director than DePalma seems to have become (with his last three directorial efforts, M:I-1, Snake Eyes, and Mission to Mars being particularly unentertaining).<br/><br/>As for performances -- Tom Cruise turns in a decent performance, for an action movie.  =)  Dougray Scott is fairly solid as the villain.  Thandie Newton is, well, passable as a ""master thief"", although I wish she'd had more opportunity to show off her skills instead of simply being a face on screen.  That complaint also applies to most of the remaining support cast, but then, they ARE supporting cast.  M:I-2 is definitely a star vehicle for Tom Cruise, but in my opinion it's a fairly fun one.<br/><br/>My rating: 8/10.  But be sure to see it in a theater with good sound; it'll lose something on video or in a venue where the speakers aren't high-quality."

","Mission Impossible 2***1/2[3 1/2 Stars]-Let me start by saying that the first half of this sucked and was kind of like ''Mission Impossible**[2 Stars]'' but the movie really turned around in the second half.I never seen an hour of any movies as good as the last hour of this movie.It started with tom cruise getting into a secure building which was even better than the first and he comes face to face with the villain and the 60 minutes of action begin.I have to give most of the credit to director John Woo.His directing is the best around exspecially how he managed to save this movie.It was pure John Woo action.This is the first movie where i have given the director most of the credit. Also Tom Cruise gives his best performance ever and Anthony Hopkins gives a better performnace than John Voight from ''Mission Impossible**[2 Stars]'' despite he was only in 15 minutes of the movie.But well be lookin foward to seeing him in ''Hannibal'' the sequel to ''Silence of the Lambs***[3 Stars]'' which he will most likely get this years best actor award for just like in the first.Personaly I think John Woo should get this years best directors award and and some kind of achievement award for one the best directors of all time exspecially for this movie,''Face/Off***[3 1/2 Stars], and''Broken Arrow**1/2[2 1/2 Stars]."
"chain67","9","1","1","25 May 2000"," Top Notch Thriller
","Mission Impossible 2 is by far the best pure action sequel to come out in many years. What makes M:I-2 so good is are the action sequences which couldn't be possible without the excellent direction of John Woo. Woo makes the most out of every scene, trying to squeeze every possible inch out of each scene. Tom Cruise puts on a good performance as IMF agent Ethan Hunt. Ving Rhames in top notch as Luther Stickell. Rhames surprisingly gets the best lines in the movie. Thandie Newton is also very enticing as Cruises partner and love interest. But the main acting asset of this film is Dougray Scott as the main villain Sean Ambroce. Scott's performance is interesting and riveting. Surprisingly M:I-2 has a pretty decent plot which never gets slow or uninteresting. So if your looking for a pure adrenaline rush or a top notch thriller see Mission Impossible 2. 9/10 Excellent Thriller"

","One word for this movie: BANG! for your buck, that is. Not one second of boredom, no wondering when the movie will ever end. Over the course of it's nearly 2 hour length, the action is either there or not far away. It was sure nice to see this movie back to it's roots, too! The high tech gadgetry, the ya never know who it is masks, and the psychological warfare, all but missing from the first MI movie, is back in all it's glory here for MI's second outing. My only problems with this movie was I felt like it was 'here we go again' from other movies at some points, and the 'that's impossible' feeling you get watching some of the stunts (pardon the pun!!) Sometimes I didn't know if I was watching Star Trek V or Matrix, or it really was a Mission Impossible. Other than those minor points, a totally enjoyable movie. I give it a 9.<br/><br/>Dave"

","I believe this film is great if you are on the mood of watching an action movie, with the thriller of spying and the romance of a love story. Almost all the required elements to make this a box office success. Some detractors argue about the excessive use of slow motion, which was a resource used by John Woo to emphasize the action scenes (and also to help Mr. Cruise a bit with his kicking abilities). If you like the action gender, you will love this movie, from top to bottom. If you don't...you'll also enjoy it."
"rgreen7360","8","1","1","28 May 2000"," Plot is refreshingly simple for a spy thriller.
","A necessary evil of  action/spy thrillers such as Mission Impossible and all the James Bond films, is that the plots tend to be too complicated for everyone to easily follow. This film manages to avoid that pitfall, offering a plot that can actually be summed up in one sentence. In the spirit of not giving the plot away, I will forego writing that simple sentence. Just be assured anyone can follow the plot without too much trouble. The stunts are spectacular, and it appears as if Tom Cruise does a good deal of his own stunts, enhanced no doubt with a large amount of computer enhancements. Thus, my only criticism: A stunt has to look as if it is possible to actually pull off in real life. Most of these did not. You truly must suspend reality, and accept the superhuman feats which Ethan Hawke manages to pull off.<br/><br/>And oh yes, Mission Impossible still has the greatest theme song ever put forth in a film."
"Gordon-38","8","1","1","25 May 2000"," An improvement on the first movie
","As the credits rolled, my buddy turned to me and said loudly, ""John Woo sucks!""  I replied, ""Are you kidding?  That was better than the first one!"" He spent the rest of the evening making snide comments about the movie and generally being baffled by the fact that anyone could even like the movie, let alone think it was an improvement on DePalma's ""Mission Impossible.""<br/><br/>I didn't have nearly as much trouble following the plot of the first movie as most people seemed to - but the sequel certainly eschews the needless complexity of the original with a fairly straightforward plot.  There are some enjoyable twists and turns, but everything remains pretty clear.<br/><br/>The stuntwork and action set-pieces are better this time around, too.  The laboratory break-in is clearly intended to top the fabulous computer vault break-in from the previous film.  It doesn't quite make it, but it's still a great scene.  The climactic scene is a spectacular chase with some stunts involving motorcycles that are every bit as impossible as the helicopter-in-a-tunnel bit seen in the first movie...but nowhere near as stupid.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise, as always, is an appealing hero.  Ving Rhames is entertaining, if not given much to do.  The real strength of the movie, I think, comes from having a much clearer and more well-defined villain;  Dougray Scott projects menace and spits bile with the best of them.  Also adding a great deal to the story is the presence of a real love interest - Thandie Newton is gorgeous, and makes a good partner with Tom Cruise.<br/><br/>My friend with the low opinion of John Woo just didn't care much for the style of the movie - the characteristic touches that make John Woo a recognizable director instead of a journeyman who points his camera.  The slow-mo, the odd camera angles...I thought it made the whole package a lot more stylish and visually enjoyable than its entertaining but visually pedestrian predecessor.<br/><br/>Neither ""Mission Impossible"" movie works on quite the same level as the television series from which they take their name - about all they have in common is the name of the secret agency that the heroes work for and the ""This message will self-destruct..."" opening.  But in judging the movies in their own right, they are pretty entertaining.<br/><br/>And John Woo doesn't suck."

The sequel's plot is more straightforward with fewer surprises, but the memorable visual style Woo imparts on the film, combined with good performances from the heros and the villains, make it a worthy successor.<br/><br/>Here's looking forward to MI-3!"

","John Woo has made a terrific film with MI2. The action is an adrenaline-pumping, high octane thrill ride.  It's worth seeing just for the last fifteen minutes alone.

Cruise does a wonderful job as Ethan Hunt and the girl is very good too.  The plot is quite obviously secondary to the masterful action of the film, but it holds together well on its own.<br/><br/>If you suspend disbelief and go into this movie with an open mind, you are certainly in for a very fun ride."

","John Woo has now returned to film after a three year wait, and it's worth it. But is MI2 really a good Mission Impossible film. Well, no it isn't. It's no longer a spy flick but an action film. All of the ideas of the MI tv series and first film are gone for big action. John Woo is not a subtle director and this film proves that. It's clear the script was made for his style of film-making as opposed to a true MI sequel. All of the small details from the first film are lost.<br/><br/>But now as a John Woo film, this movie is very good. Great fast paced action. Amazing camera work and Woo's trade mark doves are all in it. Cruise is good, but I give all the credit to Woo who has made a sequel almost as good as the original which doesn't happen often."

If this is not considered a great movie, I don't know what is."

Cruise did a lot of his own stunts and was surprisingly (finally) convincing as a serious action-protagonist.  Thin character development, but who cares? Woo's typical brilliant crafting of the action sequences carried the film. This will easily top 200 million, and will without question be the top summer movie.  It also solidifies Woo as the preeminent big-budget action director filming today."
"myst031","8","1","1","28 May 2000"," Great Action
","I saw this movie because I loved the original, and the idea that one of my favorite directers John Woo was directing it. During the movie I came to the conclusion that some people would not like this movie because of the use of slow-motion(which happens a lot).  However, I like the slow-motion technique John Woo uses, without it the movie would be to quick to really admire.  I also liked Tom Cruise in the movie although the long hair doesn't fit him as well as the short cut like in the original.  The supporting characters were I admit, overshadowed and never really used, especially the helicopter pilot.  Scoot plays a great villain even if he doesn't have the look that Gary Oldman or even an asian actor like Chow Yun Fat could have brought to the part but you wouldn't believe they would double as Tom Cruise.  All in all I thought the film was great, probably a little less plot heavy then the original but at least the MI:2 series is doing what the Bond series never understood, changing directers to add a new perspective and new film style so the formula never gets tired."

Save your money and wait for it to come out on video."
"DaWeas007","9","1","1","24 May 2000"," Great Job Mr. Cruise
","This second installment of Mission Impossible was great, but not quite excellent.  It had all the elements of a great movie, intrigue, action, suspense, but there were at least one or more moments in the movie where the tempo more or less lagged.  However, it should be noted, that those scenes which lacked Action or Suspense, made up in Sex Appeal with Tom's Sexy Co-star, thus cutting the lagging scenes down to ones countable on one hand. Despite the few lagging spots, the movie did have some key moments. With Tom doing the majority of his stunts, possibly all of them, that in and of itself was quite amazing.  Add to that the motorcycle chase sequences, the crashing 747, and the main Rock Climbing Sequence at the beginning and you've got some high quality, well timed, and overall great highlights.  Not to mention, to add to the overall appeal of the movie, John Woo directed it, who previously directed such hits as The Replacement Killers, Face Off, and Hard Target, three great action flicks.      In Summary, if you are either a Tom Cruise Fan, a Mission Impossible Fan, or a John Woo Fan, this movie is a must see."
"UnclePaul","8","1","1","26 May 2000"," The film that the original ""Mission Impossible"" should have been
","Director John Woo is the epitome of an action film director.  His action scenes are choreographed like dances--Bullet Ballet, if you will.  He's also known for effective use of slow-motion photography, and all of his films have a very stylish look.  His best films were made in Hong Kong--rent ""Hard Boiled"", ""The Killer"", or ""A Better Tomorrow 1 & 2"" to see what I mean. None of his Hollywood films have lived up to that standard, but ""MI:2"" stands alongside ""Face/Off"" as his best American work to date.<br/><br/>The original ""Mission Impossible"" made a ton of money, but the plot also made a ton of people say ""huh?"".  The nearly incomprehensible story took the steam out of the action, the cool score, and the even cooler gadgets. (Although I did find the 'chopper in the tunnel' finale a little too ludicrous.)  Thankfully, ""MI:2"" has simplified the story, and improved upon the score and the gadgets.  And the action sequences are visually more impressive and much more exciting.  In ""MI:2"", a fast-acting, lethal virus has fallen into the hands of villain Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott), and Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) needs the help of a beautiful thief (Thandie Newton) and his computer genius buddy (Ving Rhames) to get it back.  That's it--that's the plot.  Not 25 lines.  Just one sentence!!  Perfect for an action film. In fact, rumor has it that the story was finished only after they decided on the action sequences.  I'd believe it--this isn't exactly an epic story a la ""Doctor Zhivago"" or ""Ben Hur"".<br/><br/>Let's start with the action sequences.  They're amazing.  Woo is certainly the master of creating action scenes with the added benefit of great style. His use of slow-motion enhances the frenetic fights and chases, and there are many fights and chases.  To me, the original ""MI"" lacked the full-out action that I expected from the Impossible Mission Force.  ""MI:2"" did not leave me wanting.  It's certainly the most exciting film I've seen this year.  Many bullets fly, cars and motorcycles chase each other, there is hand-to-hand combat, and several different objects find ways to explode. The motorcycle chase finale is on par with the boat chase in ""Face/Off"", and the final fight seems to take up the last 25 minutes of the film as it transitions from one locale to another.  An extra bonus: you'll recognize Cruise in most of the scenes--he did a large amount of his own stuntwork. An early climbing sequence (you've seen some of it in the theatrical trailer) is especially impressive in this regard.<br/><br/>Cruise is an underrated actor, but maybe that's changing since his well-deserved Oscar nomination for ""Magnolia"".  I count this as Cruise's first all-out action film, so it didn't require too many of those skills. But I'm sure it was quite a workout.  Several of his films have had action sequences, but he's not flying a jet (""Top Gun"") or driving a race car (""Days of Thunder"") in ""MI:2"".  And he's really quite good.  His role in ""MI"" was more dramatic than aerobic, playing the cold and impersonal Agent Hunt.  Cruise actually gets to show emotions this time, making Hunt a much more enjoyable character.  He also does the main thing I wanted to see him do in ""MI""--kick a lot of butt.  He's like an American James Bond: charming, intelligent, and ruthlessly lethal when necessary.  Newton's character is similar to the best of the Bond girls: she's sexy, has attitude, and brings something to the table other than just screaming ""help me"".  Newton debuted to great reviews in 1991's ""Flirting"", but this should be the film that gets her widely known (except for the 25 people who saw ""Beloved"" in 1998). Unfortunately, I really didn't sense a lot of chemistry between her and Cruise, and her role pretty much disappeared in the final quarter of the film.  Rhames is excellent as always.  He's been good every time I've seen him--a filmography that includes ""Bringing out the Dead"", ""Entrapment"", ""Out of Sight"", ""Con Air"", ""Rosewood"", and ""Pulp Fiction"".  This movie also has some humor, with most of the good lines going to Rhames and a helicopter pilot who might remind you of Murdock on ""The A-Team"".  One thing I'll say for Woo's American films--he's always had a showy role for the villain. (Lance Henrikson in ""Hard Target"", John Travolta in ""Broken Arrow"", and Nicolas Cage/Travolta in ""Face/Off"").  And ""MI:2"" is no exception--Scott (probably best known as Drew Barrymore's Prince in ""Ever After"") really chews the scenery as the villanous Ambrose.<br/><br/>I've made a few James Bond references because this film has all the elements of a good Bond film.  Dastardly villain threatens the world, and it's up to the daring secret agent to save the day and the girl who's in the clutches of said villain.  He must defeat the 'bad guys' through fights and chases in exotic locales, helped by numerous gadgets and a few trusty allies.  In fact, ""MI:2"" reminds me of ""Thunderball"" (1965), one of my favorite Bond films.<br/><br/>With all that praise, why does it get 3.25 stars instead of 3.5 or 4?  For a few (fairly minor) reasons.  I've already mentioned the lack of chemistry between Cruise and Newton--they're certainly easy on the eyes, but the relationship wasn't really believable.  They 'met cute', and their interactions never grew more interesting after the first 15 minutes.  Also, the first 45 minutes were plagued with way too many slow-motion shots of people walking.  That's it--just walking.  I can understand it for action sequences, but just watching Cruise or Newton walk through a room or down the street?  It actually got a bit annoying.  Anthony Hopkins appears very briefly as Hunt's boss, but their interaction didn't interest me as much as the usual ""M sending 007 off on the mission"" scene at the beginning of the Bond films.  The first 45 minutes are worth 2.5 stars, but it ends big--raising the overall film to 3.25 stars.<br/><br/>Buy your popcorn and prepare for a real thrill ride, and I don't think you'll be disappointed by ""MI:2"".  Note: make sure you see it in a theater with a huge screen and high-tech sound so you get the most of the impressive sounds and visuals."
"gretchvg","8","1","1","25 May 2000"," pure adrenaline--with a plot
","In making this film, director Woo has taken the intensity and exhilaration of the vault break-in sequence in the original M:I movie and expanded it over many of his scenes, making seeing M:I2 an energy rush for the audience. There is none of the tedious and hard-to-follow dialogue of the first movie, and the plot is structured to offer the kind of trickery and twists found in a good espionage story without being so darn confusing. Cruise is skillful in his action yet remarkably genuine in his dialogue and interactions with other characters. This is a pleasant surprise after his presentation of a more cerebral and serious Ethan Hunt in the first film. M:I2 moves quickly, and the fact that Cruise performed his own stunts adds an interesting dynamic to the action that puts viewers on the edge. Thandie Newton also serves as an ideal complement to Hunt's sensuous and sensitive side. She reveals his humanity in the face of peril as well as his will to take action, which ultimately makes Cruise's character more real and intriguing than in the original M:I."
"MrKearns-2","8","1","1","29 May 2000"," Don't knock it til you've seen it.
","While many moviegoers will simply pass over Mission: Impossible 2 simply because it is another classic of the summer blockbuster genre, they will be missing out. Critics won't love this film, but they won't be able to claim that they absolutely hated either. Movie fans, and especially Tom Cruise fans, on the other hand, will find themselves seriously involved in it.<br/><br/>Most of the discussion of this film has been a contrast to the original, Brian De Palma directed Mission: Impossible. In doing so, the point is probably missed. The difference between the films is more than just stylistic directorial difference, it is an entire genre switch. While the first MI might have passed for an action movie occasionally, it was primarily trying to be Sneakers (1992) starring Tom Cruise--a techno-thriller.<br/><br/>When it came to Mission: Impossible 2 on the other hand, director John Woo was made aware that no one really wants to see Tom Cruise hacking at a computer. If anyone has to, it will be a character whom we experience only as a computer hacker--enter the other holdover from the original film-- Ving Rhames.<br/><br/>Generally, there are moments when Mission Impossible 2 falls on its face. Tom Cruise and Thandie Newton seem to fall in love instantaneously, and so deeply that both would sacrifice their lives over a one-night stand. That simply reeks of convenience on the part of screenwriter Bob Towne, though the simplicity probably pays off in the end. The fact is that people who will enjoy Mission Impossible 2 aren't particularly interested in seeing a romance, and that's why this one is such a whirlwind effort.<br/><br/>There are certainly other flaws, such as a repetitive use of the ""mask peeling"" that we saw overdone in the first film. It is used at every opportunity in this film, to the point that you almost expect everyone to be someone else, but, after all, John Woo made an entire film out of the idea (Face-Off), so should we really be surprised?<br/><br/>The film is carried by a couple dynamic performances, a pounding score, and some Matrix-like action sequences that make everything worthwhile. Though the story is formulaic to the nth degree, in the end, it doesn't matter. Mission: Impossible was never about character depth and biting wit, it was about action and suspense. John Woo has brought these to MI2.<br/><br/>Cruise, as usual, is effective, though probably too likeable to be real. Admittedly, he has taken a step down from some deeper performances in Eyes Wide Shut and Magnolia, but, frankly, it only makes sense. If it weren't for films like Top Gun, Days of Thunder, and the like, Scorsese, Kubrick, and others probably never would have heard of Tom Cruise.<br/><br/>On its own merits, Mission Impossible 2 would get 4.5 stars out of 5 for the action genre. However, if we are basing it on quality of film, it would have to drop to a 3.5. <br/><br/>Not everyone will like it, but if you think you would be interested, odds are, you'll be impressed."
"bcredsox","9","1","1","26 May 2000"," Best Woo movie - One of the best action movies
","MI-2 is a very complete, classic-formula action movie. But aside from the action, the rest of the movie was just as enjoyable. Woo makes the most ordinary situation a stylish work of art. I saw this in SDDS, and 15 minutes into the film those losers turned the surround sound off because the next theater was complaining about the noise. So, with NO surrounds, it was still good, even though I'm getting my money back. The actors were WELL CHOSEN.  Everyone in the movie had strong presence, especially Dougray Scott. I loved this movie. It was a simple, romantic, stylish, action film. And the action.... well... it stands with the best.  The situations with ""the masks"" in this one are original, tense, and VERY WELL DONE, I can see why Woo did this film.  This is one stylish movie, one of my favorites.<br/><br/>MI-2 is pretty much a ""superhero film."" And Tom Cruise is made out to look very badass. MI-2 is surreal, over-the-top, and at times ridiculous.  But that's what people want to see on the screen.  And that's why this is one of the most enjoyable films I've ever seen.  This IS Hollywood, and it's the way it SHOULD be."
"Impamo","8","1","1","26 May 2000"," This movie tries too much...
","In no way this sequel is better than the first movie or the series. It lacks the tension, the plot and the intensity of both. The stunts may be amazing but it's to much... The motocycle jump over the bridge is clearly computerized and Tom Cruise's ""i'm doing every stunts man!"" attitude is grabbing our attention more than the movie itself. Even the battle scenes are looking weak for those who saw ""Romeo must Die"". The best thing to come out of this movie (and it's a consensus) is Thandie Newton. It's a great summer flick but it's not quite an accomplished mission"
"paulmg","8","1","1","24 May 2000"," Better than the original
","Though it's become increasingly obvious that the Mission Impossible films have little to do with the television show they're derived from, that's not necessarily a bad thing.<br/><br/>This film focuses less on action and more on the characters than the previous entry; or, for that matter, most action films of this day. Some will find this difficult to swallow, like a foreign food that the throat refuses to accept not because of a bad taste but because of the unfamiliar sensation it causes, which is too bad, because it actually makes for a great film, though not necessarily the one viewers will walk into the theater expecting to see.<br/><br/>At center stage is the romance between Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and Nyah (Newton), the latter a thief whom Hunt is assigned to acquire for his next assignment. Their by-play and chemistry forms the heart of the film, and the manner in which the rest of the plot plays out really depends on how these two characters care for and react to one another.<br/><br/>For action fans, there are, of course, the great stunt and set pieces that one would expect, the majority coming at the end of the film. Those looking for a mind numbing experience with as little thought involvement as possible might wish to skip the first half of the film and go straight to the big finale. But for those who want a bit more from their action films, the film should amply satisfy. Recommended."
"johnnykey","9","1","1","25 May 2000"," Mission Accomplished, Too!
","Worth every penny and then some.<br/><br/>I was incredibly impressed with relative newcomer Thandie Newton.  A very good performance in what might be her breakout picture.<br/><br/>Also, although I am not a big fan of Tom Cruise, I have enjoyed both of his MI performances.  This one perhaps more than the first, solely due to the obvious influence of director John Woo.  In the first movie, Ethan Hunt was played as more intellectual and planning.  This movie, Ethan Hunt shows a purely physical side, displaying a fighting style somewhat reminiscent of the late Brandon Lee.<br/><br/>Directed by action master John Woo, this movie is naturally studded with eye-popping stunts.  From the free-form mountain climbing in the opening credits to the astonishing motorcycle acrobatics in the climatic chase scenes, one hardly has a moment to draw a decent breath, much less get more popcorn.  A real roller coaster of a movie that, somehow, still manages a good plot line and oddly believable characters.<br/><br/>The only possible complaint I could muster was an overuse of slow motion and stop-time photography ... but this is a very slim complaint at best.<br/><br/>Spend the money to see this one first run, then go back when it hits the dollar theaters in a few months and enjoy it again."

But, I think they spent too much time on the ""love story"" instead of focusing on what drew me into the movie. I was looking forward to the spy tricks and stunts that the first one had.

","In ""Mission:Impossible -- 2"" Tom Cruise's mission is clear -- make a sequel that stands out.  And it's Mission:Accomplished, thanks to the actor/producer's hiring of Hong Kong Action Master John Woo as the film's director.<br/><br/>On the surface, the addition of Woo means Cruise's IMF Agent Ethan Hunt now fires two guns at once inside of one.  It also means that Tom Cruise, Hollywood Mega Star Pretty Boy instantly becomes Tom Cruise, Kung Fu Badass.<br/><br/>But there's more to Woo's style than just slo-mo angles of double-fisted gunplay and ludicrously acrobatic karate moves.  The director brings an over-the-top, operatic melodrama to the standard espionage story that justifies the preposterously far-fetched action.   Woo's accent marks are all over the film -- from a scene very early on showing one character's split-second vision of apocalyptic doom, to a close-up of a fire reflecting in the villain's tormented eyes, and to -- perhaps most memorably -- a ubiquitous John Woo white dove preceding one of Cruise's most dramatic entrances.  The movie is much closer to Woo's classic films than to anything on the old '60s TV show.<br/><br/>The film's last 45 minutes are a non-stop, heart-racing ride.  The sequence concludes with another standard John Woo feature -- two friends, turned mortal enemies, in a prolonged mano-a-mano slugfest death match in a remote area, in this case a rocky cliff above the ocean.  It doesn't get more dramatic than that, and movies don't get more thrilling than ""Mission:Impossible -- 2""."

Now for digital shots or green screen shots there were alot especially with cruise jumping out of the helicopter into the bylocite factory.

","When it comes to action movies, John Woo is almost a genius. Rarely have I seen so many exciting elements packed into one film. The startling thing is that it all worked wonderfully! Mission: Impossible 2 is one of the best action movie to come across the silver screen in years.<br/><br/>The first offering in this series was marred by an over complicated plot structure that made the movie difficult to follow at some points. The plot elements of MI2 were simple enough: A deadly German virus is about to reach the open market and wreak havok on the world as we know it. Ethan Hunt is charged with assembling a team of specialists to keep that from happening, including a beautiful professional thief. The execution of the plot is amazing. It shows a much more human side of the character and focuses more on the love story aspect of the movie than your typical action pic.<br/><br/>Then there are the action sequences. Tom Cruise is a total bad ass. Motorcycle chases, car chases, rock climbing, gun fights, hand to hand combat, knife fights and cool computer stuff, all executed by a very attractive leading man. John Woo can make an action sequence art.<br/><br/>I think this will be the best action flick of the summer."

Jon Woo's influence upon this movie is readily seen via the action sequences (which raise the movie to new heights in the Action genre) and while the storyline at times formed slowly or incompletely (The first 30 minutes or so) through gratuitous action, I'll admit I was completely entertained."

This may be one of Mr. Cruise's finest moments, since he does perform all of his own stunts, most of which I'm suprised he even survived.

Director John Woo is know for his all out violent and action packed films like The Killer, Bullet in the Head and Hard Boiled.  Here the action is thick and heavy with sweat rather then ketchup (blood).  The ending was less then desirable.

Don't get me wrong, I'm all for plot and character, but this is one of those kinds of movies where it doesn't really have to apply, just shut your brain off and enjoy the ride.  Although I did like M:I-1 better for it's plot, this one I enjoyed on the fact that I saw Tom Cruise's character show a little more development, and it didn't hurt that he got the girl this time (for those that saw the first one).

"ironhorse_iv","5","3","6","28 September 2017"," Abort Mission! Abort Mission! This film really is mediocre! Don't bother, seeing this movie! Disavowed this!
","While, the more recent films in the 'Mission: Impossible' series, are highly enjoyable. This movie is not. It's impossible to watch! Although, this 2000 sequel directed by John Woo is far more stylized and action-packed than the first action reboot film directed by Brian De Palma in 1996, also based off the television show of the same name (1966-1973). It's also, a lot more over the top, and cheesy. While, some people might like that, I found it, to be, too much of a dumb repetitive overused rethread that got quickly tiresome. All the flying doves, unrealistic wire-works, dual-wielding pistols, explosive, mirror shots, and ridiculous face masks make it seem like, I was watching the 1997's action film, 'Face/Off', all over again. It barely resembles 'Mission: Impossible'. You would think a spy movie like this, would have cleverer, well-thought out infiltrate scenes like the original. Sadly, it does not. Instead, the movie fill up the time, with clumsy and pointless similar actions scenes of the Pierce Brosnan's 'James Bond' era, such as people in love, nearly running each other, off the road in car chases, everybody shooting at and drunkenly handling the dangerous, fragile McGuffin that can wipe everybody off, the face of the world, as if it's a bottle of booze, and tons of climbing and jumping off things, just there to feed Tom Cruise's ego. It's really lame. Another thing, this movie destroys with its shallow action, is the sophistical twist and turns of the psychodrama that the first movie, established. This sequel's plot of finding and destroy, a genetically modified disease is unique, but it's also, a bit paper-thin & disappointing. I was really, hoping for something more complex. Something in the same vain as 1998's thriller novel by Richard Preston, 'the Cobra Event'. Don't get me wrong, the movie tries to be smart in its unrealistic out of the blue love-story between IMF agent, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) & pickpocket theft, Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton), by copying the classic Alfred Hitchcock's 1946's film, 'Notorious', by having a spy falls in love with a woman, whom arrangement, requires her to get back with her ex, in order to find a dangerous weapon. Yet, the screenwriter, Robert Towne doesn't do much new development with it, so the subplot in this film, come across, more like a rip-off, than a homage. The love story was also so bad written with its over-lovely dialogue that the relationship between Hall & Hunt, became so fake-looking that the couple don't even carry over to the other sequels. Despite that, the acting between Newton and Cruise was alright. The two had some chemistry, but the film doesn't give enough time for the characters, much to click. It doesn't help that the villain for this film, doesn't add much, weight to the triangle. He was highly forgettable to the point that I forgot his name for this review. I had to look it up. It's also sucks, that Dougray Scott's thin Scottish accent makes it, really hard to understand, anything that ex-IMF Sean Ambrose is saying. He was by far, the worst thing, in this movie. Regardless of the villain, Tom Cruise doing 95% of his own stunts like the 'knife near the eye' scene, is pretty impressive. I just don't buy him, knowing martial arts. As for the music score, I have mixed feelings about the soundtrack. I kinda dig the new rock version of 'the Mission impossible' theme song with the guitar rip. However, rap-rock band Limp Bizkit 'Take a look around' version of this song is not good, as the lyrics has little to do, on what happening in the film. It's more of an excuse for Fred Durst to defend and bash his critics for their troublesome music career. Regardless, it's not the only song that seems, out of place. The Zap Mama 'Iko Iko' song from the beginning of the film, doesn't match, the Utah desert-like settling. It sounds more like music, you would hear, in a Caribbean Cruise Line with 1988's 'Rain Man' film, playing the background. Another, out of place tune was the exotic Middle Eastern forlorn music, being played, during the love-scenes. Its seems like composer, Han Zimmer was taking a day off, and just gave the leftovers/unused music tracks from the 2000's historic film, 'Gladiator'. It really doesn't match anything, that happening on screen. It's also equally as bizarre to hear music, here, that Zimmer would use in director, Christopher Nolan's 'Dark Knight' trilogy (2005, 2008 & 2012). Overall: All the jarring flaws, this movie, has, proves, without a doubt, in the end, this is one mission, you shouldn't accept. Just avoid. You're better off, not watching it."

","Fans of the original Mission Impossible film may be a disappointed in this as there is a dramatic change in style which goes along with switching director from Brian De Palma to Hong Kong action supremo John Woo. Personally I loved this film and found it to be the most enjoyable of the three Mission Impossible films.<br/><br/>Here the plot is far less convoluted, we know from the start who the bad guy is and we know what he is trying to do we just have to sit back and watch the action as our hero sets out to stop him. Sean Ambrose is a former member of the Mission Impossible team who has destroyed a plane carrying a scientist who had requested help from the Mission Impossible team, in order to find out why Ethan Hunt must recruit Nyah, Ambrose's beautiful former girl friend, and persuade her to go undercover to discover exactly what he is up to. It turns out that Ambrose is planning to hold a company to ransom using an artificial deadly disease to which he has stolen the cure to. Not that the company were that honourable, they had created the disease in order to create a demand for the cure.<br/><br/>The action is impressive from start to finish, as one would expect from a John Woo film it is all perfectly choreographed, sure it isn't exactly believable but it is a lot of fun. Cruise is on form as our hero Ethan Hunt and Dougray Scott was suitably menacing as the villainous Ambrose, I also enjoyed Thandie Newton's performance as Nyah. If you are a fan of action films that don't require too much thought then I strongly recommend this one."

","My Take: Impressive action-with-style save the rather tepid script. <br/><br/>Departing from Brian DePalma's thickly-plotted (but actually more satisfying) original, Hong Kong action god John Woo took over the mission DePalma chose to accept, and while the movie is less plot, more action with emphasis of Woo's trademark style, this sequel lacks the sort of class and brilliance of its predecessor. Although many regards DePalma's original as ""confusing"" or ""trivial"", I much prefer the original over this flashy, globe-trotting sequel. Still, there are some moments here and their, but sadly, most of them happen during the climax (which probably prompted me to give this film at least a ***). <br/><br/>MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE II (aka MI:2) took the plot less seriously. But the problem this time is the plot is the one missing now. It has a plot that I hardly cared about, which leaves the film with a lot of dumb things going around. What we're left is an edgy, bloated action picture that has fun with its cool visuals and stunts without thinking about common sense. Just put ""dumb"" right in the middle of ""action"" and ""movie"" and enjoy the action-packed material.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is back as CIA agent Ethan Hunt, sent on another mission to retrieve and destroy a genetically modified disease called the ""Chimera"" before it falls into the hands of the bad guys. The bad guys are lead by Sean Ambrose, played by Dougray Scott. Thandie Newton provide the lead female (I wouldn't call her the damsel-in-distress for she has a lot to do to be one) and Vhing Rhames is back as one of Hunt's old buddies.<br/><br/>The film's director is Hong Kong action director John Woo, who really knows how to make action movies, oriental or not. MI:2 may not be as triumphant as his other action bonanzas like FACE/OFF, but he still gives the action enough grit and cool to be notable. There are some neat car chases and loud motorcycle drives, but not only in the action sequences can Woo shoot good. There is one scene in the movie where Ethan Hunt walks through a dark corner and makes noise, scaring a couple of doves flying, in slow-motion. This wasn't an action sequence, but it's shot well to be just as terrific as one.<br/><br/>For good summer fun, MI:2 is not a bad choice. Yes, it's dumb. Yes, the plot does nothing more than string together Woo's stylish stunt sequences together, but it looks good and it does feel good. If only it were any better. <br/><br/>Rating: *** out of 5."
"kxok630","2","3","6","21 August 2007"," Hilarious
","Sidesplitting comedy starring Kryptonian super hero Ethan Cruise. He is impervious to bullets, and can outrun them too.<br/><br/>Oh, this movie is bad. Really bad. The world's least exciting action hero and renowned James Bond wanna-be chases around for some miracle virus that can croak everybody. Originality such as that is on a par with a Scooby Doo cartoon, and remarkably, the story gets even stupider. There are about a hundred thousand faceless enemy agent guys for you-know-who to beat up or shoot up or blow up, while they fire thousands of rounds at him and.....miss. The lethal stuff? It of course is kept in a tiny vial that's designed to shatter if you look at it the wrong way.<br/><br/>The female lead (both actor and character) is a paper doll cutout, apparently from a fashion magazine, who manages to act down to the level of our hero. Did I mention he's on screen about 100% of the time? When he's not delivering brilliant lines like, ""You won't die,"" he's having high speed motorcycle chase/fist fight with some guy, saving the world while moving in endless slo-mo shots, and staring blankly at other actors when they talk.<br/><br/>What's so humorous about this trash is how seriously it takes itself. The hilarity factor raises my vote on this about 5 notches from its actual cinematic value, enough to give it a 2 overall. Laughter is great medicine, and in that respect, this movie is just what the doctor ordered."

This movie proves it once and for all, SLOWMO HAS TO GO IN ACTION MOVIES. I've had to watch the movie at least 10 times to get all the facts. Three action sequels that are terrible, MI:II,Matrix (the first one was great), and any new bond movie. I guess sequels now adays are not up to par with their predecessor.

","When I first saw this film 5 years ago at the cinema I was a little disappointed. I enjoyed the film a lot but I was a big fan of Mission Impossible 1 and had seen the TV series on occasion. The first movie was a great spy film, with all its clever twists and turns and Ethan Hunt a sympathetic human character, here he is recast as action man or to put it another way the American version of James Bond, which would have been fine if not for Tom Cruise essentially being a completely different character than he was in MI1. But thats where the negative points end. This movie is, on the surface a big cheesy action film, the kind of thing Dolph Lundgren or Steven Segal would be in, only its good. There is a good plot despite many comments although you do get the sense that the plot was put in afterwards to facilitate the action. Essentially its about villains peddling a super virus and its cure so they can make money from making people ill and then selling the cure. Its really not that important, this movie shines in the action scenes and has some excellent cheesy dialogue ""This isn't mission difficult Mr.Hunt, this is mission impossible"" <br/><br/>Overall this is the movie equivalent of eating an entire box of quality street to yourself in one sitting- you love it but feel a bit guilty afterwards.<br/><br/>If you have the DVD be sure to watch ""Mission Improbable"" an excellent behind the scenes parody from MTV with Ben Stiller."

"eagle_owl","2","3","6","22 February 2005"," A poor excuse for a blockbuster.
","The original Mission Impossible film, starring Tom Cruise as agent Ethan Hunt was a pretty good attempt to update the 60's TV series for a new generation. Sadly the sequel has failed to live up to the modest standards set by its predecessor. Tom Cruise reprises his role, but probably wishes he hadn't.<br/><br/>This is a poor excuse for a blockbuster, with dull characters, and a plot that only exists as an excuse for some mind-numbing action. Its style is heavily indebted to the Matrix, a sure sign that nobody had any faith in this franchise's ability to compete on its own terms. This end result is a film that never really establishes an identity of its own. There are one or two effective moments, but they can't outweigh the negative aspects.<br/><br/>As if that wasn't bad enough, this is a John Woo film, and so we can't get by without a few of his trademark doves flapping about the place. I've got nothing against the doves per se, but they're ludicrously out of place here.<br/><br/>The performances in this film leave a lot to be desired. Tom Cruise goes through the motions, Thandie Newton's character is unmemorable, and Anthony Hopkins seems totally disinterested, as well he might. Worst of all though is Dougray Scott's horrendously over-the-top villain.<br/><br/>What you're left with is a very lacklustre and severely disappointing film, where only the action scenes linger in the mind, and even these are barely original. It only serves to make the original Mission Impossible look even better by comparison."

","The first time (and the only time, ever) I saw this movie was in the movie theatre. I decided to give it a chance and hope it was better than its predecessor. My wife and I and another couple spend the evening watching this dreadful slop. That's all I can call it. The only thing that kept me awake during the film was a snoring noise coming from the seat in front of me. John Woo added the special effects which took the attention away from the ""story"", if there was one. Tom Cruise arrogantly pleased the ladies with his daring mean feats and overcoming all the odds with his self-gratifying overacting. The plot was 100% predictable and utterly boring. Definitely, the worst money I've ever spent on a movie. Don't make the same mistake as I did."
"wglenn","3","3","6","8 November 2004"," What Happened?
","I was disappointed in the first Mission Impossible film but had heard that this one was better. John Woo directed it. The man who wrote Chinatown did the screenplay. Thandie Newton was in it. Everything sounds great. So what happened? <br/><br/>MI2 is a mess, and not even an entertaining mess. For an action film, it's quite boring at times. There are long gaps between action sequences, and one has to endure some of the worst romantic dialog to come out of Hollywood in some time. Thandie Newton, who was so charming in the otherwise mediocre Truth About Charlie, is totally wasted here. I'm still trying to figure out how Robert Towne goes from writing Chinatown, which was so intelligent and stylish, to this dreck, which makes some of the bad, late-night, low-budget action shows on cable TV look pretty well-developed and coherent. An absolute flop of a screenplay. <br/><br/>This was the first film I had ever seen by John Woo, and I can only assume that his earlier work is what gave him such a good reputation. When he finally does give us action sequences, they go on far too long and often seem ridiculous. If you find the opening sequence of the film - Tom Cruise ""rock climbing"" - silly and unbelievable, stop the video there and go on to something else, because it's not going to get any better. The worst combination for an action film is to be dumb AND pretentious, and that is what Woo accomplishes in MI2. His trademark use of slow-motion gets old quick and leaves you feeling like you're watching some slick perfume ad on TV. This is especially true towards the end of the film, when doves come flying out of the smoke and fire. Rather than care about the climax of the story, I'm wondering if a naked, anorexic blonde angel is going to appear and whisper ""Action Film, the new fragrance from Calvin Klein."" It's just silly stuff, with no sly, tongue-in-cheek awareness of its own silliness.<br/><br/>And there are so many holes in the script... <br/><br/>And those masks... What is it with the masks? It works the first time, seems old the second time and is just plain ridiculous the third time.<br/><br/>I'm guessing Woo was an influence on the Wachowski Brothers, so I could be reading this wrong, but he seems to rip off several elements from The Matrix, which was released a year earlier. If only he had bothered to make MI2 as tight and smart as that film!<br/><br/>If you're an action fan, get the DVD and skip to the chapters with the fight/chase sequences. The story doesn't make much sense and the actors struggle with the terrible screenplay, so you're not missing anything important. <br/><br/>If you're a fan of the original series or of intelligent spy films, forget it. As bad as it was, you're better off watching the first Mission Impossible movie. At least that had some class. And I'm sure any James Bond film would be more enjoyable."
"gbheron","6","3","6","23 May 2002"," Mr Woo Misfires
","""Mission: Impossible 2"" is not in the same league with John Woo's previous ""Face/Off"" or even the first installment of Mission Impossible.  It has all the glitz and glitter, A-list staff, and money to be a highly entertaining film. But it isn't. The story is simplistic, unoriginal, and has plot holes and dead-ends aplenty. The acting seems even more wooden that is allowable for the genre, and the characters are two-dimensional. For an action movie, it has way too many boring, snooze zones.

"very_doubtful","10","3","6","8 July 2000"," What is The Matrix? Who cares?
","Just to get down the negative critics list right at the beginning, so we can talk about the things that are good in this film (which is, in my opinion, a lot):<br/><br/>1) Yes, the plot is pretty weak compared to the first Mission: Impossible. But activate your brain for a moment, would you? Do ""James Bond""-films have a great plot? What about ""Die Hard"", ""Con Air"", ""The Rock""? If you open your eyes and take a closer look you'll find that even ""The Matrix"" doesn't have as great a plot as most people claim, in fact it did copy a lot from other films. The story of M:I-2 doesn't have any major flaws and JOHN WOO perfectly covered up the weakness of the plot.<br/><br/>2) Going into the same direction is the predictability of the film. It was fairly simple to recognize whether a character was wearing a mask or not. But the expressions on some of the person's faces were intentionally created in a way that would allow us to find out about the disguise before the characters did.<br/><br/>Well, that's about everything negative I could possibly find.<br/><br/>Now let me ask you, all you people who gave this movie bad ratings: DID YOU EVEN SEE THIS MOVIE? DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA; WHAT ACTION IS ABOUT?<br/><br/>Action is not about blowing everything to pieces Michael Bay/Jerry Bruckheimer style. It is not about shooting as many people as possible just to see that it's done. And it is definitely not about throwing some computer-generated effects & explosions at the audience.<br/><br/>And what's that crap about the action in M:I-2 not being possible in real life? Of course it isn't! Otherwise, why would we go see films in theatres and pay money for it? Wake up! Get real! Name one big blockbuster action movie which was actually realistic! Anybody? Just because there is no Matrix (some of you would probably say: ""How would you know?"") doesn't mean the film s****!<br/><br/>It's sad that the majority of people don't appreciate JOHN WOO's work. No other director did or will get close to what JOHN WOO has achieved. He's not just a simple director, he's more than that. He's a virtuoso, a master of his field. His films are PURE AESTHETIC ART! He's the only one with the feeling for it, the only one capable of doing anything like M:I-2. JOHN WOO is the best thing that happened to Hollywood in a long time.<br/><br/>I am a big fan of JOHN WOO, actually I consider him the GOD OF ACTION, not mainly because of films like ""Broken Arrow"" or ""Hard Target"" but rather because of his Hong Kong masterpieces (i.e. ""The Killer"", ""Bullet in the Head"" etc. etc.). I always thought that he didn't reach the level of the aforementioned Hong Kong films in Hollywood yet, because those Hong Kong films contained not only lots of action but - even more important - themes like friendship, loyalty and love.<br/><br/>""Hard Target"" was very good, ""Broken Arrow"" was visually astounding, and ""Face/Off"" was simply outstanding. For a long time I would consider ""Face/Off"" the best action film (along with ""Terminator 2""). Just a few hours ago JOHN WOO made me change my mind, when I saw the showdown of his newest masterpiece. I was amazed, the action and dynamics of the movie were way better than anything I had ever seen, it was gripping and at the same time BEAUTIFUL, it was SHEER BEAUTY that came off the screen right at me (and the pigeons are beautiful too, over and over again, this time even more than in his other films). This is JOHN WOO's first American film which can actually compete with films like ""Hard Boiled"" or ""The Killer"" (both by JOHN WOO, of course) in terms of action & choreography. I wasn't sure if I would ever be able to say that.<br/><br/>Like I said: the action is beautiful. When there are cars exploding, they're not just flying away with much noise, filmed in a rather clumsy slow-motion as in Michael Bay's typical video-clip imagery (he's an excellent director, believe me, I like him, he's just nowhere as magnificent as JOHN WOO). Instead, in M:I-2, scenes like the car explosions are filmed in a way that's as close to perfection as it will probably get. The camera angles are well chosen, the cuts are at the right places in the film, and the camera speed fits perfectly. Also the beginning of the film where we see Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) climb up the wall, is perfectly filmed. Check out how wonderfully the camera moves in towards the actor right at the beginning of the scene!<br/><br/>Another highly exciting scene is the shoot-out in the lab. The music (by Hans Zimmer, the god of soundtracks) is combined with the imagery so ingeniously that it felt like a dream, an ecstasy of pure beauty (again this word; sorry, but it's the word that best describes JOHN WOO's style).<br/><br/>Many people have criticized the acting in the film. Of course, none of the actors will be nominated for an Oscar, but on the other hand the acting was not that bad either. Tom Cruise was very convincing, Thandie Newton did a decent job and so did the villain (Dougray Scott), although he was not as charismatic as movie-villains usually are. But if you hate the acting in M:I-2 so much, then let me tell you one thing: except for very few movies (one of them being ""Face/Off"") there are nearly no Hollywood action films with a superb cast. Take ""The Matrix"" (""Why always this film?"" you might ask. Well, because I think it is an excellent film but, in my opinion, generally overrated) for instance: Did this film have good acting. You think it did? Well I think it was just very good at pretending that it did by throwing in cheesy statements like ""it is the question that drives us"" and ""what is real?"" etc. trying to give the characters some profundity.<br/><br/>Personally, I think M:I-2 should set a new standard for action in Hollywood (but I'm afraid it won't). I saw this film today and likely, I'll watch it again tomorrow.<br/><br/>Overall: BEAUTIFUL, LOVELY, AMAZING, WONDERFUL...<br/><br/>My rating: 10/10 (Thank you, JOHN WOO)"

"Motoko","Null","3","6","30 March 2001"," A step backward after the first film but makes you look forward to the next
","There can't have been that many magicians in Sydney when the MI:2 team arrived to film. How else can you explain so few doves in a John Woo film. Slo-mos? Yep, they're here. Double gun action? Check. Check. The feeling that Woo is taking his material a shade too seriously? Definitely present and correct. And that's the problem. Woo is in danger of becoming like Tim Burton: a director so recognised for a particular genre and style that he comes perilously close to parodying it whenever he makes a movie. But this movie has about as much to do with Woo as it does to do with knitting. This is a Tom Cruise movie. More than that. It's a Tom Cruise movie produced by Tom Cruise. And while focus is mainly on giving the audience excitement and bang for their buck, the fact that every shot makes it abundantly clear that Cruise is doing all his own stunts gives you some idea of who the main participant is.<br/><br/>Now I liked the first movie. I know some don't. I know they find it too complex/too different from the series/too implausible. Well, tough. I thought it was excellent and was really looking forward to this. The fact that Woo was being given the reigns only added to the anticipation. The result is pacey, exciting and breathtaking. Sometimes. But nowhere near often enough.<br/><br/>This doesn't look like your normal movie. It's brighter. Clearer. Most of the lighting is natural and it gives the movie a very odd, almost comic book feel. The work of Jack Kirby rather than Frank Miller. Action movies have never looked this MTV and as an advert for film making in the Antipodes, (the film is set and shot in Sydney) it does more than Muriel's Wedding, The Piano and The Matrix put together. And it also gives you a clue as to the target audience. This movie was rated 12 in the UK and it shows in every frame. It's action without consequence. No entry wounds. As little blood as possible. And with instantly disposable bad guys that are as nasty as possible with out being nasty enough to want to emulate. This isn't automatically a bad thing but it's like comparing Westlife to U2. Alright in a safe, disposable sort of way but the grown ups are doing bigger and better things.<br/><br/>As much as Woo would like to think this is a romance, it ain't. You can see him trying to inject emotion and pathos into this story but the script just isn't strong enough and the middle drags forever. An opening air hijacking promises much and gets the blood pumping but then Woo seems to potter about for an hour waiting for something to keep him occupied. Just when one aspect gets good, something drops it down a peg. Key example: Cruise drops from a helicopter down a vertical air-shaft to wipe out the remains of the dread virus. And then spends 10 minutes walking around at Michael Myers pace instead of moving with more appropriate expediency and getting the job done in 2. It's not necessarily a problem with the plot. It features some clever twists and turns and generally keeps moving throughout but Robert Towne can write better dialogue than this. Ving Rhames pops up to keep fans happy and is then totally marginalised. Thandie Newton looks gorgeous but she's a little too wooden for comfort. The same could be said for Tom. Both of them are great actors but they're just spinning their wheels here. Dougray Scott's evil glint of barely controlled mania makes him the ideal foil for Cruise's clean cut hero and is easily the best part of the film. An evil leer is never off his lips but he lapses into panto bad guy just when we need true dispicableness. In short, we've seen all this before and we've seen it better. Hans Zimmers guitar led score is pretty damn pulse quickening though. Even if the occasional lapses into Enya-ism's and flamenco don't quite match the on-screen carnage.<br/><br/>But cometh the final act, cometh the action maestro. Doves, slo-mos, wooshing sound effects and all. If the middle 60 minutes go interestingly yet wearingly slowly, the final 30 assaults you with the energy of a bottle of lucozade and the force of a battering ram. With the last vestiges of plot quickly and neatly removed, Woo pulls in his stunt team and merrily explodes the set with gay abandon. If you saw anything you liked from the trailer, this is where it comes from. And yes, Cruise does his own stunts and looks too damn cool doing them. Perhaps not since Goldfinger has the life of an international espionage agent looked this enticing. Dark shades, leather jacket, loaded 9mm and black motorbikes fitted as standard. I wonder if MI5 are recruiting...<br/><br/>Of all his Hollywood films this is clearly Woo's most blatantly commercial. Every time Cruise is in frame he looks like a warrior god. Every time Newton walks down a street her derriere swings like a pendulum. A case of style over substance? More like cash over credibility. But does that make a bad film? No not really, just not a great one. It proves beyond doubt that this is a franchise with phenomenal potential, but maybe Cruise should let his ego take a back seat next time. If they really do rope Ang Lee or Oliver Stone in for part 3 then hopefully he'll just give them the money and let them get on with it rather than make sure he looks good in close up."

Ask yourself this; do you really want to see Tom Cruise shooting people in slow-motion for two hours? REALLY? Because that's what this is. If you want a real espionage spy thriller, go for the superb original. If you want a proper action movie that doesn't just involve the 'hero' shooting down hundreds of people, go for Tomorrow Never Dies."

","I have to say, I was truly giddy about this film - couldn't *wait* for it to be released...unfortunately, if it wasn't for some moderate inventiveness on John Woo's part and a stellar soundtrack, I would have walked out of the film less than halfway through.<br/><br/>The story was boring, cliche, and almost offensive...not only did I take issue with the plot as an avid movie-goer who doesn't particularly enjoy being patronized, I was truly aghast at the turn which Thandie Newton's character took.  This is an actress I thoroughly enjoy and one who has played some of the strongest characters I've seen in film, but this character became such a stereotypical damsel in distress that I was disgusted, and I was utterly confused as to why Newton would even take such a role...<br/><br/>Woo showed some of his typical flair for action sequences, but there were moments in which I was totally baffled as to why he would make certain choices for scenes creating a completely unrealistic aire...not to say that he is a director rooting his style in realism, but usually his sequences are so enthralling I  don't stop and think 'yeah right...'<br/><br/>The high point of the film occurred within the first 15 minutes as Cruise scales that rock face...it was shot well, and some nice muscles never hurt any scene. ;-)  The first thing I noticed in this scene, however, besides Tom's well-toned biceps, was the music...there were interesting choices that I thought fit well rhythmically and set a fun tone.  More than setting the tone for the scene, my notes on the music of this scene set the tone for the rest of my viewing - the music was the single saving grace for this film...it was inventive, compelling, and eclectic...it was truly what made me stay in my seat...<br/><br/>See it if you must, but this is definitely one to see at the cheap theatre......"

I often burst out laughing during the fight scenes. Story-wise they do everything to make a simple plot look extremely convoluted, but it doesn't become any more intriguing.

","The second movie in the series Titled 'Mission: Impossible-two"" is starring 'Tom Cruise'. The entire cast and crew worked hard to achieve this significant feet in the two dimensional world of watching cinema. This feature film was produced and directed by Hollywood stars who made this cinema possible.
A film from the makers of Mission Impossible Two is a prospect to the cinema industry because the movie halls all have seats with cushions like in a palace but we watch drama, action or comedies but not to be revealed after. A cinema is the essence of visual texturing from the digital universe like the International Movie data Base. 
Unrelenting attention to screenplay and attractions to sight see: amateur photographer. Cinemas are the prospect to act another person's screenplay if a producer opts to produce: incentive to grow in wealth. Wealth of Nations is a term that is used to symbolize gross domestic products growth rate whilst simultaneously assuming that it is needful. 
The moment between a actor and actress is indescribably true to visual screening in the second dimension. The multifaceted tricks that actors practice are the skills that actors and actresses pose as. The real truth of the picture is the momentous truth at the three dimensional level which is not subject to evaluating the depth of the communication. 
Tom Cruise the actor and cast and crew are appreciated for the cinema."

","Mission Impossible 2 (3.5 out of 5 stars).<br/><br/>Mission Impossible 2 is a stylized explosive action film that brings a little freshness into the series. And an improvement over a dull first movie. Tom Cruise is back and better than ever. The film does pack a little punch with action which the first movie was lacking. <br/><br/>The plot follows Ethan (Tom Cruise) being assigned to go after a rogue IMF agent Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott). Who steals a chimera virus and plans on making profit with the cure. Ethan is going to need help from Sean's ex girlfriend Nyah (Thandie Newton) who is a skilled thief. <br/><br/>The plot has a twist or two that will throw off the audience with surprises. Especially with the spy gadgets like facial mask to disguise themselves as somebody else. <br/><br/>The action sequences can be ridiculous in this film. With John Woo's stylized direction. Kind of has a spaghetti western action scene with Woo having white doves flying between the hero and villain. And slo mo scenes with characters giving stare downs with flames between them. Also, cars explode easier in this movie when they barely crash into another. But I am sure all this is for summer entertainment at the movies. With a thrilling opening sequence with Ethan free rock climbing to Nyah and Ethan having a showdown in their sports cars racing on the side of the mountain. Then, there is another stunt with Ethan repelling down to a secured building which leads to a firefight. And another climatic showdown with a motorcycle chase and Ethan going face to face with Sean. <br/><br/>Dougray Scott was good as the rogue agent. With a performance that looks like he has anger issues and is about to snap at any given moment. Thandie Newton was okay too that spies for Ethan. While Brendan Gleeson playing a character that works for a biocyte pharmaceutical company that created the virus. His character was dull and undeveloped. But good thing he was only in it for a small part of the film. Ving Rhames returns as Luthor, Ethan's sidekick and tech guy. <br/><br/>The music score by Hans Zimmer does bring some energy to the film mixing the theme song with a fast paced rock score. <br/><br/>Overall, Mission Impossible 2 is a pretty fair film. Better than the first movie. The action sequences are exciting and ridiculous. Have to keep in mind it is one of those blockbuster type of films. John Woo's direction can be a little cheesy with its style of white doves flying between characters or slo mo stare downs that try to build suspense. The plot is good which does slow down a little bit in the second act but picks back up with a wild bike chase and a fight sequence in the climax."
"BA_Harrison","6","2","4","30 March 2017"," Mission: Impossible Woo.
","Despite having a more than competent director in Brian De Palma, the first Mission: Impossible movie was a tad disappointing, it's convoluted plot and lack of action leaving this viewer struggling to remain focused. For the follow up, Hong Kong action expert John Woo took the reins, promising to pump some much needed adrenaline into Ethan Hunt's next adventure. But while many of the expected Wooisms are present and correct, the director's trademark high-octane thrills really only kick in in the final act, meaning that much of the film is just as tedious as DePalma's original, albeit thankfully a lot easier to follow.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise returns as Ethan Hunt, spy extraordinaire, whose mission is to convince sexy thief Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton) to resume her relationship with international criminal Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott), who has recently acquired the antidote to a deadly virus, and who is now trying to get his hands on the virus itself, hoping to sell the combo to the highest bidder. Helping Hunt on his mission are IMF agents Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) and Billy Baird (John Polson), the latter acting as comic relief.<br/><br/>All of this is fairly humdrum—the old 'Earth threatened by a deadly virus' plot holds very few surprises—and much of it is silly (I lost count how many times the rubber mask trick came into play), but the film finally delivers the good stuff in the final reel, when Hunt gets to shoot at lots of bad guys, go wheel to wheel with Ambrose in an exhilarating motorcycle battle, and then duke it out with the boo-hiss villain on the beach. It is only then that Woo gets to really show what he is capable of, although the action is a little light on the blood squibs for my liking.<br/><br/>6/10. Marginally more enjoyable than the first film, but still not great."

","After the first ""Mission Impossible"", I was thinking to delete the rest of this franchise without watching. But back then I bought the soundtrack for this movie because of the Metallica song that was not released anywhere else. And it was a pretty good soundtrack. Because of music, I decided to give this movie a fair chance and, to my surprise, it was not bad at all. I did not like the first one because it pretends to be a thriller that keeps you in suspense and it pretty much failed in that attempt. I'm not saying this one is more intelligent, but at least it does not pretend to be. This is a typical Woo action movie with lots of chasing, fighting and gunfire and, in own genre, it is really OK.

It was just dumb and unnecessary. Then the bath tub scene was kind of okay, but the conclusion with: ""I triggered the alarm, heh heh!"" was quite dumb again. And then the chase - ridiculous - and kissing scene, Oh My God, the kissing scene. It was just awful, horrible, scarring, sickening! <br/><br/>After that this thing didn't really get any better. They found a way to make every twist predictable and every action scene stupid and dull. It strange, I've seen a lot of bad movies, but most bad movies are more entertaining than this. How can you suck all the fun out of the cheese? How can you make 'over the top' boring? This movie can teach you that. I am surprised at how cheap this movie feels compared to how much money went in it. I am typing this as the last boring dumb stupid cliché scene plays out and even though I am multitasking I feel like I have been wasting time.

"JohnRayPeterson","7","2","4","6 April 2012"," Outrageous action. Pulse pounding moments.
","I've just finished a ""Mission Impossible"" marathon and to my dismay, can't figure why this sequel rated so poorly. If all those who voted over the years had an opportunity (or the patience or the time) to watch all four episodes back to back, I think this rating thing would fare differently.<br/><br/>Is there anyone who can honestly say the scene 2 of this movie, where Tom Cruise is free solo climbing in The Grand Canyon, jumping from one escarpment to another, slipping to an almost certain death and hanging from one hand like even Alex Honnold would not dare to try (Google that guy), is not an absolutely stunning piece of action footage. For good measure, the music playing in the background of that scene, the song 'Iko Iko', was, for those who know the story or origin of the song, a brilliant choice. The cinematography in that movie was superior to the original movie, in my not all that humble opinion, and certainly as good as the following two sequels. Critics, including music critics, all agree the OST (original sound track) in M I-2 is the best; I could not reproduce, at home, the sound I heard at the cinema, at least not without my neighbors getting very upset. I remember, twelve years after the fact, the excitement I felt walking out of the cinema; the others were also exciting, just not quite as much for me. The franchise does so well because many other 'moviegoers' walk out of the cinema with that very same excitement.<br/><br/>I must acknowledge that, as with all big Hollywood action features, the story as well as the stunts defy reality and it's mostly fantasy, so the 'M.I.' films are aimed at thrill seekers and who isn't one from time to time. Anyone trying to judge these movies, comparing them to classics or award winning novel based dramas, is farting downwind.<br/><br/>The first three 'M.I.' had renowned directors, but John Woo was unquestionably the best at action sequences, which abound in M I-2. The motorcycle chase scene is one hell of a superbly choreographed and edited action scene. Dougray Scott is the best villain of all the four M.I.; argue that one if you can. The best female co-star of all four 'M.I.', for my liking, is Thandie Newton. I know I am completely counter majority opinion here, but I maintain that back to back viewing of the four movies, or viewing in the same year would generate far different results."
"jereme-samuel","8","2","4","27 March 2012"," Not as good, but close to the original
","Despite the fantastic action scenes and the fairly solid story line, MI2 did have a few low points. First on all, that love story seemed quite out of place. I mean it was a change but it seemed a little forced. Then there was that constant use of those masks that were made famous from the first flick. I mean how many masks could they possible have!!??!! And last but not least...I know that John Woo is famous for his remarkable action sequences and that his technique is to put portions of it into slow motion and then speed it up at the last second, but it was just used far to much in this film. I understand that sometimes it is a good effect so that the audience can see exactly what is happening, but this time it was just overkill. The movie would have been shorter if all these slow motion scenes were eliminated, because with them, it just seemed to drag on a little too long.<br/><br/>In spite of the minor problems that the film has, it will still make millions, because of Tom Cruise alone, but Thandie Newton did a wonderful job, playing opposite the star and Dougray Scott, who was last scene in Ever After, portrayed an excellent foil for Cruise's character. Fans of both Cruise and the original television series will enjoy this flick, but first time MI viewers will enjoy it because you did not have to see the first one to understand what was going on in the second one, as is the case with most sequels. All in all a good action-packed movie, well worth the money and definitely a big screen movie. Don't miss this one at the theaters if you are into the big summer action movies. I give MI-2 a 8 out of 10."

The director of Mission: Impossible 2, John Woo could have made this movie a little exciting, and everyone would probably higher their ratings on Mission: Impossible 2. This movie was still good, had enough violence, explanation, and fun in it to be awesome. I personally think that all those movie critics should have given Mission: Impossible 2 a higher rating. Mission: Impossible 2 is worthy of more. It is awesome. Every single Mission Impossible is good, and will always be a classic.

","Tom Cruise reprises his role as Ethan Hunt in M:I 2. I will be honest. I have never seen the original Mission impossible film. But luckily, with a sequel like Mission impossible 2, you haven't been missing anything. You don't feel lost. you feel engrossed. Though some of Mission impossible 2's story plot is kind of silly, it's still dynamite entertainment and explosive fun.<br/><br/>Mission impossible 2 involves an ex IMF agent named Sean(played by Dougray Scott) who is going to unleash terror on the world by spreading a virus, and it's up to Ethan Hunt(Cruise obviously) to stop him. with the help of his team, and his love interest Nyah(played by Thandie Newton), who is an ex of Sean's.<br/><br/>The whole thing with the virus may sound a little silly. But don't put that as a flaw in your opinion. M I 2 has some cool action sequences, including the climactic chase scene on the motorcycles. Of the two Mission impossible films that i've seen, MI2 is certainly better. Not that MI3 was bad or anything.<br/><br/>MI2 is a lot of fun. Tom Cruise is a likable action star and a good actor. Actually, a great one. I know this movie was big ten years ago but he is. I had never appreciated his acting until I saw ""Magnolia""(one of my three favorite films). I never knew how funny he could be until I saw him in Tropic thunder. And I never knew how lovable he is until I saw him in Knight and day. Since Knight and day, i've been on a Cruise/Diaz marathon.<br/><br/>I still don't get why everyone hated Vanilla sky. But anyways, back to MI2. MI2 is a lot of fun. It's very entertaining, action packed, cool, and a lot of fun. I know it's weird to be reviewing this now, but since i'm on the Cruise/Diaz theme, I thought what the hell. Mission impossible is what got Cruise his title as an action star. And even today he still has it."

And it's somewhat peculiar that the weakest of the three action films is the one made by the most pronounced action-director of them all, John Woo.<br/><br/>It's too bad, because I'm a big fan of John Woo, who's made some of my favorite action movies of all time (Hard Boiled and Face/Off immediately come to mind). But I don't know what went wrong here. His signature use of slow motion, which has worked beautifully in the past, is simply tiresome in this movie.<br/><br/>The scenes drag on for too long. I'm not advocating the George-Lucas-faster-more-intense-ADD /Bourne/ Bond/ camera-mounted-on-top-of-paint-blender-style of film making, which is so popular in action movies today. But the (for example) slow-motion-flamenco, quasi-sexual-foreplay-car-chase and motorcycle-jousting scenes just go on and on and on to the point that I just want start throwing things at the TV and shout ""Get on with the story!"" Sadly, the story (if there indeed is one) is less than engaging, and the characters are far too dull. I don't buy the supposed chemistry between couch-jumper Cruise and token black girl. The main villain played by Dougray Scott (surely, that can't be a spoiler?) is weak and bland. Anthony Hopkins is there to pick up a paycheck, no more, no less."

Hugely overrated Hong-Kong director John Woo professes himself a Christian and star/producer Tom Cruise is a self-avowed ""Scientologist"" (whatever that is), so there's the usual hypocritical sexual morality pitted against indulgent bloody violence. The millions of children who will watch this film world-wide could validly conclude that violence is normal and sex non-existent. You would never know, by watching this lengthy stomp-romp, that half the movie audience is female, most of whom are turned off by violence and more interested in relationships. Apparently, Cruise made $75 million from this picture, which was so poor that Paramount fired him for it. That's decadent, too. But we're talking about a global movie industry in which dialogue is barely comprehensible (because it will only get dubbed anyway) and the story is only an excuse for 'action' of the sort that even chimpanzees will watch. A parting thought: the bad guy, played by Dougreay Scott, is trying to steal a whack of money and gets killed for it.

In fact, it's quite outstanding.<br/><br/>While I have my complaints (especailly Nyah\Thandie Newton, who I'm sorry to say I dislike the mere presence of and I believe was horribly miscast), M:i-2 is, quite clearly, very underrated. It's a highly entertaining film that'll keep you on the edge of your seat, and despite not being a huge fan of Woo's style, the action sequences in this movie are fantastic, as is Hans Zimmer's score for the film.

It is packed with Director John Woo's signature action sequences and is lead by a good performance from Tom Cruise.<br/><br/>Say what you will about Cruise's off-screen antics, the guy packs a punch as CIA operative Ethan Hunt. The Mission Impossible trilogy is one of the best series in the spy genre.<br/><br/>The first time I watched this film, I was amazed by Woo's awesome action direction and the hard rocking music score by Hans Zimmer. The second time I watched this movie, I was more critical of the plot, which seemingly had a few holes. On my subsequent viewings, however, I think the plot is sound, it just takes a few times watching the movie to understand it completely. Most of the Mission Impossible films have complex story lines; MI2 is no exception.<br/><br/>At some point, I hope this movie is released as an unedited DVD so that the film's original 3 and 1/2 hour running could be viewed as an option to the theatrical release. As I understand it, many plot holes are filled with the longer version.<br/><br/>If you don't mind complex thrillers and you enjoy heavy action, then this movie is for you. If you are not a Tom Cruise fan, probably won't like this film since he pays homage to his past movies (the opening seen with the sunglasses sticks out).

We get one at the beginning, we get one in the middle and we get one at the end and in between it is some of the dullest plot angles ever recorded.

Indeed in theaters when Cruise and Scott hit each other in mid air everyone in the theater howled with laughter. Unfortunately had this movie had more amusement I may have actually woke up.

","M:I 2 is the Citizen Kane of action films.<br/><br/>I've heard a lot of bad-mouthing this movie, so hear me out on why it is good. Why it's great, in fact.<br/><br/>CINEMATOGRAPHY Shots were beautifully colored in this film. Australia was bright and cheery. The Southwest's red land contrasts beautifully with the blue sky. The red-tainted Outback is that much better in the midst of a blood-red sunset. Biocyte's lab is a visual monotone of cool colors, which later pose a stark difference to sparks and explosions. M:I 2 had beautiful cinematography.<br/><br/>PLOT I really don't follow why so many claim the plot is bad. It's certainly not as convoluted as the first, but I think that that's for the better. People speak of plot holes, but I didn't see any (nothing major, anyway). The premise was certainly more intelligent than, say, Die Hard (yippy-kay-yay, let's go kill all the motherfu**ers). It's not Syriana, but hey.<br/><br/>ACTING There seems to be a rule in action movies that actors can't act. Now, performances weren't quite Oscar-worthy here, but this movie was really an exception to that rule. Dougray was menacing, a truly great villain. I don't think Cruise has ever let me down in the acting department. Thandie Newton was GREAT in that she wasn't the female just thrown in for the love story; she was a real person, darnit!, and she had emotions and facial expressions and wasn't just there to have sex! I mean, some have called the acting wooden, but I'll take this over Vin Diesel's monotone expression in xXx any day.<br/><br/>DIRECTION/EDITING Very well done. M:I 2 doesn't suffer from quick cuts like so many other modern action films do. It succeeds brilliantly in its camera-work, allowing us to always understand what's going on, and giving us some very eye-pleasing shots in the process. Scenes inter-cut with each other (Cruise going into Biocyte/Ambrose explaining what he'll do, Cruise in motorcycle chase/Newton on bluff, etc.) were done not only so they wouldn't subtract from each other, but so that they complement each other and give us the bigger picture in a very well-done way.<br/><br/>SCORE Yay for Hans Zimmer! Along with what many deem a genre change (btw, many seem to have a problem with this. I personally don't, and if you do, I'd simply ask you to go along with it. If you still disapprove, well, sorry.), Zimmer changed the theme from a more spyish tune to a much more actionesque theme that perfectly reflected the mood and genre of M:I 2. Also, ""Injection,"" the song played at the end of Biocyte Infiltration when Cruise jumps out of the building, is my favorite action song. It's a beautiful song, with vocals, strings, a drum, and if I'm not mistaken, some synth, too. It's a very ""deep"" song, perfect for a stylistic action scene that ended up being Biocyte Infiltration. It's doesn't bang you over the head with ""I'M HEAVY-METAL ACTION MUSIC!!!"" but is a soothing, ear-pleasing piece of art (yes, ART!), that adds emotion when needed, suspense when needed, and complements what is being shown PERFECTLY. Yay for Hans Zimmer.<br/><br/>ACTION (ACTION!) Action is undoubtedly this film's biggest selling point. Some call it over-the-top, and it is, but it's nowhere near as bad as something like xXx. Also, everything shown is, though very improbable, at least possible (you've beaten out a lot of action movies, now, already). On top of that, it was AMAZING! Slo-mo when needed to add stylistic depth to Cruise running through a shot-up corridor towards an anonymous light source of hope as sparks soar through the air; a knife driving down atop Cruise's face, stopping abruptly mere MILLIMETERS from his eye (and, btw, this was done w/ Cruise for real; no special effects); Cruise lifting the rear end of his motorcycle up as a car hood passes underneath it, swinging his pistol around to shoot the gas tank of the previously mentioned car until it blows up and rolls very eye-pleasingly, etc, etc. (Actually, I think myth busters proved you can't blow up a car by shooting its gas tank, so I'll give you that; still, its a very minute detail and worth it for a very insane shot). This action is way up there, giving movies like The Matrix a run for their money.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION M:I 2 is done so well in so many aspects that I really don't feel it should be written off as a stupid, over-the-top action movie. I mean, how many action movies in the following six years can compare in action OR plot? I think you'd run out of films before you'd get to the end of your fingers. Even if you included every action movie before it, I'd think you'd be hard-pressed to find a large number. Certainly, M:I 2 deserves more than its current 5.7 rating."

","Agent Ethan Hunt is assigned to retrieve a deadly virus and make sure that it doesn't fall into the wrong hands. The main suspect who is attempting to use the virus for deadly purpose is Sean Ambrose, a former agent that once worked with Hunt, who has his own team of agents and mercenaries.<br/><br/>With John Woo at the helm, the film is much more based on action than suspense and intrigue of the first. There is a decent espionage story, however it is not very original, but Woo manages to play it all out in a stylish and very entertaining fashion. Featuring more spectacular set pieces and outrageous stunts than the first, which then all culminates in an typically explosive Woo climax. Tom Cruise is good as the cool and calculating Ethan Hunt who, once again, packs plenty of cool. The highlight, though, is Dougray Scott as the villain - it is a simple and shallow role, but Scott plays it out to fit the film's comic book feel damned near perfectly.<br/><br/>The down point is the ridiculously cheesy romantic element of the film. Thankfully, it only appears in a few scenes, but one of them (a shootout in a virus lab) is pivotal so that might ask you to stretch your ability to forgive for scenes like that. Ironically though, in that scene things end up like should - a good character commits self-sacrifice to save another good character who can foil the bad guys' plan - but it's how that scene gets there that is so dumb.<br/><br/>Though, it shouldn't be that hard to let that slide as it is quickly overshadowed by much more engaging and enjoyable action scenes - including an awesome motorcycle chase - which is what exactly what an action movie like this needs. 8/10<br/><br/>Rated PG-13: violence and intense action"

Although this film isn't really in the vein of the ""Mission: Impossible"" TV series, probably because most of the main character in the series died in the first film - it's still a great action film. Tom Cruise returns as Ethan Hunt (with long hair this time) as well as Ving Rhames as Luther Stickell. And the action sequences are incredible (as to be expected from John Woo). However, the love interest and villain this time around are okay in my opinion and the score could be better. But otherwise, I think it makes for a worthy sequel - a solid 7 out of 10."

The ""action"" scenes were what disappointed me the most, they would have been laughable apart from the fact that this film took itself so seriously.<br/><br/>Most of all this film was boring, boring, boring! Not what you want or expect from any action film. I can accept no plot and bad acting as long as there is some half-decent action in a film. This film was just dull and irritating with terrible action scenes (the motorbike chase scene is just stupid).<br/><br/>I think this film must be Cruise's worst hour, even if he tried to act worse I don't think it would be possible. The more I think about this film the more I realise it was probably the worst film I have ever seen.<br/><br/>I'm not being spiteful, I enjoyed Woo's Face Off and I thought Cruise was good in The Last Samurai.

In this case a combination of terrorist and businessman to black mail the world thru the use of a germ agent. The funny part is Cruise's portrayal of his battle with these evil villains and plot is nothing more than a personal ego boost for himself. Even a James Bond or Superman where never as full of themselves, they where confident but did battle for god and country not for themselves.<br/><br/>There is of course the race against time to save not a TEAM member, and t the world, but Cruise's love interest. Preventing the world from getting the virus always seems less important. It always seems to be what is in Cruise's best interest.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of the old TV series, where disappointed with the first MI movie, i.e. making PHELPS and a team member the villains, this vehicle will make just make you even more disappointed.

Compared to this lunacy of a movie, the Connery Bond films were docudramas. <br/><br/>I suppose if this had been tongue-in-cheek it would have been more tolerable, but Tom Cruise & Co. obviously expected the audience to take this garbage SERIOUSLY.<br/><br/>I am glad to say the film studio didn't make a penny off me for this movie."

","First I should say I never saw the TV series. It was before my time. Now, while MI:2 borrows from several films, especially Notorious, Entrapment and Goldeneye, it by no means deserves all the criticism it has received. The action sequences, especially the pre-credit, motorcycle chase, and martial arts finale, were exciting and creatively filmed though Woo's trademark touches are bordering on self-parody. Dougray Scott made for a good nemesis and his henchman was nasty as well. In an age of potential bio-terrorism the plot has some relevance. Post 9/11, I don't think they could've done the pre-credit sequence. On the negative side Hunt has all the heroics to himself and Newton didn't make for the most alluring love interest. Still this franchise is more interesting than Bond though I wonder if it can generate twenty films and/or survive the exit of Cruise. Overall, 7/10. Bring on MI:3!"

","I have tried to comment on this film, but for some reason the comments were never accepted. This time I'll be brief.<br/><br/>It saddens me that what could have been a great series of movies, starting out with de Palmas excellent first a few years ago, has quickly been spoiled by being handed to the least suitable director. John Woo has, if nothing else, proven that with a child's mind, anything can be made cheap, lousy and lame action of the kind one hoped never would rise above talents like van Damne and Lundgren. There is nothing special or original in this movie, just remakes (or rather parodies) of the ol' classic action themes. But what is worse is that Woo manages to add an incredible amount of cheesiness to his 2-hour slow-motion action ballets. White doves appear out of nowhere and some parts of the dialogue could be used as doormats at a kindergarten.<br/><br/>Lousy, awful, tragic. That's all I have to say."

I love action flicks, with the chase scenes and all the other elements found in them.  But this movie just didn't work for me.  It was too 'forced', with every single cliche in the book thrown in for good measure.  And of course, the requisite Matrix-type fight scene had to be included.  (Deuce Bigelow had it also, but it worked in that movie).<br/><br/>It is understood that you have to suspend some beliefs when you see a film, especially of this genre.  But this one required the suspension of any reality and some basic laws of physics, while we're at it.  Heck, even the XMen was a more believable film.<br/><br/>With interminably boring chase & fight scenes, this movie really dragged at some points. And there was enough slow-motion that I thought it was a series of TV commercials for various e-businesses.<br/><br/>Plot-none.  Dialogue-my 8 yr old could have done it.  Sets/locations-James Bond continues to rule supreme in this area.   All in all, a very disappointing movie.  How did it do so well at the box office?

I really wasn't expecting much, but planned to be open minded...and was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>Agreeably, the movie did not challenge the brain or inspire deep thought, but it doesn't pretend to.  The director intended the movie to be exciting, fast paced eye candy and that is exactly what it was.<br/><br/>While I enjoyed the first movie (it was considerably more intelligent and required that you pay relatively close attention to the plot), I found it a little dry, and with the exception of the train sequence at the end and the scene where Ethan breaks into the CIA Terminal room, there was little in the way of excitement and energy.<br/><br/>MI2 got off to an exciting start, and the action sequences (including Mr. Cruise's impressive stunts) were choreographed to perfection by the talented John Woo - complete with all of his signature trademarks.<br/><br/>Yes, we can talk about the plot holes, the incredulous,  impossible to believe story and the over-the-top, implausible action sequences, but did anyone really come to the theatre expecting realism from a summer blockbuster movie?<br/><br/>All in all, the fabulous action, beautiful scenery, high-impact sound track and the mindless story proved to be 2 hours of guilty pleasure...and don't we all need that once in a while?"

I have been a huge John Woo fan for some time and was pleased with the action scenes in this movie, some have complained about how over-the-top they are but does anyone actually go into a John Woo movie to see realistic action? The crew of MI2 developed the story only after several stunt sequences had already been plotted out and like most Hong Kong movies the story does tend to move along at a snail's pace until the last 30-25 minutes of the movie. All the Woo ingredients are here...the pigeons/doves, the hero brandishing two Berettas and elegant action sequence. For these reasons alone all Woo fans should see this movie."

MIF Man, Hunt is out again, with longer hair and a more muscles, to stop a virus. Dougray Scott is the baddie. And thats simply it! I admit this is a silly daft film. But who cares. Calling it daft does not mean its bad. This is no way a bad film. The visuals are great. John Woo is a god when it comes to action, as with Hard Target and Face/Off. The scenes of Cruise on 'holiday' scaling a mountain is breathless. The end shoot-outs, bike chase and final show down are also fantastic. And when Tom Cruise kicks the gun up...... amazing. Its a daft plot, but look at it as a panto. Like with Gone In 60 Seconds. Its a film to unwind to. You don't need a brain. You will not be a disappointed.<br/><br/>If you liked the Matrix this will also appeal to you. Black leather, lots of guns and some great martial arts done in 'slo-mo' style.

Woo's style is obvious throughout the film,  from the birds to the sunglasses,  to all of the action done in his style.  The beginning contains little action,  as Woo tells a story much less complicated than the first but enough to get you interested.  The 2nd half of the film contains more action than all of the 1st MI movie combined.  There are tense situations,  hand to hand fights,  and the usual Woo standoffs.

","Wow.  This is what I think I've been expecting the Bond franchise to evolve into.  There's a damsel in some degree of distress (although she's quite plucky and can take care of herself most of the time, which I love), numerous gratuitous car chases (where the creators faithfully adhere to the law that any time a vehicle is struck while not currently being driven by the star, the vehicle must explode), fun gadgets, a pretty formidable bad guy, some great fight scenes...  Ah, it's awesome.  The plot is much simpler than the previous installment, but it's still got some elements that will likely confuse the crowd that kinda wants that.  It's got a nasty genetically-engineered virus, and there's even a part with Tom kind of giving a nod to fans who remember his scene from the first movie where he's suspended from a rope and must maintain his balance (of course, due to the nature of the sequel, this time the scene is even more action packed and audacious if not quite as intense).  Basically, this is just a caper movie with great technology and lots of explosions, which is what I think I wanted without knowing it.  There are no major life lessons, there's no uplifting love story... I kinda buy the Tom-Thandie chemistry a little, but mostly because I absolutely have to in order to really get the most out of the movie as a whole.  There's really no believable reason for these two to have any connection deeper than purely physical stuff, and once they are together, the chemistry doesn't really work for me.  But she is the Love Interest and as such does a great job, so I am content to nod my head at the screen, chuckle a little, and say, ""Yes, I know they're meant to be a great couple, Woo, thanks for the good try, now I'm ready for some more explosions,"" and Woo of course provides them.  So anyway, I highly recommend this movie to bring out everyone's inner 8-year-old boy who still wants to see stuff blow up and stare in thankful amazement at the show."

","Many people criticized this movie for having no plot. Which is a result of many people criticizing the first for being too complex. There's just no pleasing some people but this movie could have made up for it by having some class or a formidable villain. Dougray Scott is pretty much one of the worst villains ever and a poor representation of Scottish actors.<br/><br/>John Woo uses some wonderful Australian scenery but fails to inject any sense of excitement to the fight scenes. The gun battles look too damn staged and the fist fights are all done in slow-motion, which robs them of any realism or hardcore. Seeing as how this is a PG-13 the action is also pretty damn tame. Which is a shame since Woo is a pro at this. You hardly see any bullets even enter bad guys never mind exit. It's all done off screen. If people wanted tame violence why on earth did they hire Woo to direct? It's a bit puzzling.<br/><br/>Although it IS tame it is still darker and harder than the original. But the duff biochemical warfare plot is pure video game crap. I can't believe Robert Towne had a hand in writing this. It's like a rejected plot to a Solid Snake PS1 game. There's seems to be some focus on making it a James Bond/Die Hard wannabe instead of respecting the source material and offering us any iconic or memorable set-pieces.<br/><br/>Another major thing that is wrong with this movie however is Zimmer's score. For a movie that is 124 minutes long we get about 30 minutes of music. Zimmer is known for his talent of creating ambient and versatile music. But NONE of that is present in MI-2. This was movie was made around the time of his decline into mass-produced soulless stuff. Which is a shame.<br/><br/>It's the wrong plot, the wrong director and the wrong approach that turns this into a movie for idiots. They really under-estimated the audience and fumbled the ball with this one."

Tom Cruise plays the dashing spy with a knack for bagging the ladies (a la Austin Powers, hence my summary), of course, and the fate of the free world rests on his *very* self confident abilities to put a stop to some capitalist pharmaceutical pigs who have taken their profession to the next step: create your own market by introducing a pandemic and make *millions* (picture Dr evil holding his pinky up.) The arch nemesis, Douggie Scott, who IMHO looks waaay too much like Tom Cruise to begin with (in the all too predictable and stereotypical final showdown slap fight at the end, it was difficult to tell who was who), and I'm not kidding when I say this, actually gets it into his head that 'why make millions when we can make...billions?' After Austin Powers, how can anybody put out a film like this? The doe-eyed damsel who sleeps with Tom Cruise roughly 5-10 minutes after meeting him (movie time) disappears inexplicably from the plot towards the end when she is 'dumped in the middle of a crowded city' about which Douggie says 'the more crowded the better' all the while, dollar signs lighting up in his eyes, either from the paycheck he'll get from this flaming bag of dog crap movie, or from his new set of stock options at Evil Co, Inc. which are going to shoot through the roof when the big bad virus (a virus which they grow in a Petri Dish, mind you) starts ravaging the Universe. Somewhere along the line Anthony Hopkins shows up and helps Jodie Foster find the alien message at the Seti listening station or something. This movie shouts 'I wanna be the Matrix!' and 'I wanna be the Phantom Menace!' as the endless slowmotion action takes bore you to death with very loud and very overly dramatic choir-type music blaring madly at the most inappropriate times. The numerous ludicrous action sequences with Tom Cruise's sweaty and 'finely toned' physique will make you want to do nothing short of vomit as he bares his sunken chest at you. In short, wait until it becomes a tv movie, don't pay money. You'll only encourage them. Treat hollywood like an unruly child: when it holds its breath, just ignore it and it'll pass out.

So what, if there's NO plot, NO drama, NO comedy!. Nothing much of anything, really, for us to care about.<br/><br/>But, that's okay! Right?<br/><br/>Of course it is! Why? Because you just shelled out $8.00 to see: The ""Tom Cruise-A-Thon"".<br/><br/>In this movie we get to watch endlessly, as Tom Cruise plays himself -- 'Tom Cruise' -- as he stares down beautiful women, hoping they will go to bed with him, Tom Cruise! And why shouldn't they? Why?? Because it's Tom Cruise ! That's why!!<br/><br/>And what's the secret? How DOES Tom Cruise stare at beautiful women and make them magically WANT to go to bed with him?' (Sh-h-h-h ! It's a secret.... But here it is!!! As demonstrated in this movie! Tom Cruise simply makes sexy ""Tom Cruise"" style stares, through the dancing legs of very fast flamenco dancers -- and he does it without blinking!<br/><br/>That's it ! We know this method works, and, apparently it works every time! Because is a scene or two later we next get to see Tom Cruise in bed with another young woman who simply could not resist the stare of Tom Cruise!<br/><br/>But wait, there's more!<br/><br/>In this movie we get to see Tom Cruise in several different roles.<br/><br/>First, we have Tom Cruise playing who else? Tom Cruise! Tom Cruise rides around in a new black sportscar, speeding along on lonely mountain roads. Why? Because Tom Cruise has finally FOUND his cell phone, and now Tom Cruise wants to make prank phone calls to the girl in the next car! They spin out of control, of course. But, the near-death experience of it all is just too much for them. So, this leads naturally to ... uh, well to the bedroom, of course! After all, he IS Tom Cruise! And this IS ""The Tom Cruise Show"" isn't it?<br/><br/>Next, we see Tom Cruise, mournfully gooning into the camera, just as Tom Cruise learns part of Tom Cruise's REALLY impossible mission is. Tom Cruise is to tell the girl -- the same girl Tom Cruise just finished having casual anonymous sex with the night before --[ that if SHE should decide to accept it ], that Tom Cruise needs her to go to bed with one of her former boyfriends!<br/><br/>(Deep Huh?) She does it of course! Why Because she has seen Tom Cruise's stare, and has even been in bed with, well, Tom Cruise! Need we say more?<br/><br/>Heavy, Huh?<br/><br/>But, wait!! It all works out okay! Why?<br/><br/>Because it just so happens that THIS ex-boyfriend of hers just ALSO happens to like to dress up like Tom Cruise, to wear Tom Cruise masks, and even likes to go out-of-doors, fooling people into believing that he's the REAL Tom Cruise ! [ Hey! Just like the REAL Tom Cruise ! ]<br/><br/>Meanwhile, back at the ranch ....<br/><br/>We learn that the 'REAL?"" Tom Cruise"" (oxymoron?) is pacing back and forth in the midst of Australian Outback, waiting for the director, or writers, or the mysterious black helicopter to please come back and to tell him (and the audience!!) what the rest of the movie is about, because we doesn't have a CLUE!!!!!! And what's more, Tom Cruise has just told the audience that they may have to stay in the theater until Tom Cruise finds out what's really going on!!!! (He REALLY says that folks!!!!!!)<br/><br/>Then some people in the audience started wondering out loud, ""But, why doesn't somebody just knock off Tom Cruise??? That way, they don't have to finish writing the script for this move! We don't have to stay in the theater anymore, and the remainder of its hostages can all go home! ""<br/><br/>This mindless drool goes on and on, with the rest of the ENTIRE movie.<br/><br/>The camera drags us (some of us are kicking and screaming by now!) from dumb scene to dumb scene, always into situations invented just so the bad guys can provide Tom Cruise (the producer!) opportunities to cameo Tom Cruise (the star!) !!!!!<br/><br/>But, who cares? That's okay! Afterall, it's ""The Tom Cruise Show"" isn't it?<br/><br/>We see Tom Cruise playing the Good Guy! We see Tom Cruise, pretending to be a bad guy, pretending to be the good guy. We even get see Tom Cruise pretending to be a bad guy, who is really Tom Cruise the good guy, pretending to be Tom Cruise, the bad guy! Follow that? Who cares?<br/><br/>We even have to see Tom Cruise trying his best to look, act, fight, shoot, like ...... Keanu Reeves!! (Fooled ya, huh! ) Well, the audience wasn't.<br/><br/>The high-tech stunts were obviously added AFTER someone had already seen the ""Matrix"" 30-times. The ""Cruise"" even embarrassingly wears the same long leather coat, with the same dark shades, strolls around in the same big bad building, to have the same shoot-em-up scene, with the same bunch of all-bad rent-a-cops, using the very same 50 guns Keanu Reeves left in the long-coat.!!!!!!)<br/><br/>And STILL there is NO plot anywhere on the screen ! B-E-L-I-E-V-E me!<br/><br/>But by now, its an hour and a half into the movie, so no one in the audience cares anymore!<br/><br/>But the makers of this movie ruined all the suspense -- and told us what the plot was, anyway!<br/><br/>FINALLY, after an hour and a half into this mindless movie, FINALLY we are told what the heck. this stupid movie is all about, and what is supposedly going on! Are you ready? :<br/><br/>Plot: The bad guys killed a good chemist in order to get his cure for a very bad disease, which they want to spread around Sydney Australia -- just to see what it will do to their company's stock options! ( I kid you NOT! They actually said that to us with a straight face!)<br/><br/>Tom! Tom! Baby! Booba-la!<br/><br/>You've had FOUR YEARS to come up with something better. To come up with ANYTHING! But this, Tom?<br/><br/>It looks like you tried to write the script by cramming for it the night before the movie's national release!!!<br/><br/>Other than that you let your hair grow longer -- to look more like Keanu Reeves in ""Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure!"" (which I might add had a much better storyline!) What happened here, Tommy boy?<br/><br/>NO suspense! NO ""Mission Impossible"" trademark teamwork! NO camaraderie ! NO snappy dialog! Nothing! Nothing but 'Been-there! Seen-that!"" clips from last summer's movies!<br/><br/>The only thing ""MISSION IMPOSSIBLE"" about this movie was expecting the audience to sit all the way through it!<br/><br/>I am embarrassed to admit that I was one of the few who made it all the way thru! Too stunned to get to my feet and make my way to the exit!<br/><br/>So trust me, you folks who left after the first half-hour. You didn't miss a thing!!!<br/><br/>By the end of this movie most of the audience's smart money was wagered on the bad guy! Most of us figured he was our best hope that someone --- PLEASE! anyone ! -- would kill off the Tom Cruise character, and put the remaining audience out of its misery!<br/><br/>In the last scene (which incredibly is a fist fight that drags on, without relief, for 15-minutes!), Tom Cruise and the bad guy, do every tired and leftover flying kick stunt --- deleted in the final cut of ""The Matrix,"" but included in EVERY Jackie Chan movie ever made!<br/><br/>At some point someone in the theater should have stood up and rallied us all to march across the multiplex theater to where they were showing ""Shang-Hai Noon!"" At least that movie honestly wanted to be a comedy!!!!!<br/><br/>If you are reading this, and STILL feel you simply MUST see this time-waster of a movie -- ( just because you've wondered what all the hoopla is about). Trust me! I have seen this movie! By the time the movie is over, you will have left the theater, and you will know no more about why this film needed to be made, than you did before you went in. In fact, you too will feel so cheated you may even demand your money back! Or, exiting the theater you will probably hide your face, sneak out the back door, and run for your car -- to avoid the embarrassment of being spotted coming out of this awful film!!<br/><br/>[ And Tom, I 'm serious, man, Okay? I ain't foolin' with ya, neither! I STILL want my refund! It's $8.00 bucks! You better know I mean it! ]<br/><br/>But, for anyone else who just cannot possibly get out of a promise to go see this dismal failure of movie, perhaps there's a suggestion for you in this very cryptic message:<br/><br/>""Good evening Mr. and Ms. Theater-Goer. Mission Impossible 2 is a Bust!, a Bomb! A complete disaster! We apologize but have to start the movie now. Again, we do apologize! You have only 15 seconds left to put on your very darkest sunglasses! This is an especially terrible film, so just try to sit back, and make yourself as comfortable as you possibly can. Try to relax -- But, Please try not to snore. In doing so you may inadvertently awaken some of the other theater-patrons, who may be more successful at trying to sleep all the way thru this truly terrible, terrible film.<br/><br/>While the awful movie runs about 2 and a half hours too long, please remember also that every bit of this film is very, very boring. So, as an added precaution, and for your own well-being the theater management strongly urges all patrons, that while this movie is playing, for your added safety, until the house lights come up: Please! Keep your 'Eyes Wide Shut!'<br/><br/>Thank you! And enjoy your nap! This message will self-destruct in five seconds. Good Luck!""<br/><br/>(""And yes! Regis, That's my FINAL answer!"" )"

","Following the success of both the television series and the feature film from 1996, John Woo was given the opportunity to use his 'skill' as an action film director on the much anticipated sequel.  The audience was delighted to see the film break an all-time record for use of slow-motion as well as one of the most drawn-out chase scenes ever recorded!  Woo continued to keep the viewer in suspense with more masks than a really bad Scooby-Doo episode.  Tom Cruise collects more air miles then the ill-fated plane seen in the films' opening sequence and the lead 'actress' has almost as many lines as the blonde kidnapper opposite Steve Buscemi in Fargo.  Anthony Hopkins' performance is reduced to a few seconds cut subliminally into frames of Cruise and his co-stars dodging bullets while driving backwards down a cliff on motorcycles.  The unforgettable finish to this masterpiece has some guy doing something.  It truly was a treat."
"tyler_durden15","2","2","4","26 May 2000"," Suspension of Disbelief
","Never before had I seen a movie with so many generic action scenes, so much poor dialogue, and so many flaws in it. M:I 2 is the worst movie I've seen since Battlefield Earth. The action scenes were so overdone that it surpassed laughable and went right into sad. The stuff with the pigeons in the old deserted fort was kinda funny though. The dialogue was just your average horrible Hollywood writing, probably done by some sort of animal picked out of the primate section of a zoo. And then there's the flaws. I know its just a movie and we're not supposed to take it too seriously but, how can someone blow a man-sized hole in the outer wall of a skyscraper, stand eight feet away and not feel it? That and the absurd scene with the masks in the final part are just a couple frustrating flaws. And when did Ving Rhames turn into a fretful grandmother? There's so much to this movie that I hated, it would take me another day to type it all down. Just please don't waste your money."

","John Woo proves to us again that once he doesn't have Chow Yun-Fat's deadly charisma at his side to save his ass, he is all hype and no go. We all know by now that John Woo's unabashed over-sentimentalist approach is enough to make some people puke, and this movie is no different. But that's just him, besides he does have an uncanny ability to choreograph graceful gunfights, so I'll leave him at that. The real problem however is that Tom Cruise is only an average actor (see him over-acting in Magnolia). Throughout the movie, I cannot identify his struggles against the ""bad guys"" no matter how much I want to, so therefore I fail to see the relevance of this movie. Whatever happened to the good old days when Bruce Willis captured the audience's sympathise in Die Hard? Anyhow being a big-budgeted movie, the stunt sequences just tries TOO hard to impress the audience, but again what does it have to do with anything? Its just eye-candy, and its not THAT great to begin with. So I sat there in the theatre, bored to tears, wishing that I didn't took a chance on this worthless flick."

","This is what the first film should have been.  No conspiracy inside of a conspiracy multiplied by a million like the last one.  Very good story, some of the best action sequences ever, mostly thanks to John Woo and Tom Cruise. Also if you watch the DVD with all the extras you will understand why so many things that happened in the film are believable.  The only Mission:Impossible worth owning."
"kergillian","7","2","4","8 April 2001"," John Woo makes this film everything it is...
","If not for John Woo, this film would probably be quite horrid. The script needs *major* work, but the film works because of Woo's brilliance. Beautifully shot from end to end, this film survives on how gorgeous it is, and how amazing the action scenes are.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with the film is the pacing. The first hour and change is slow and all background, then all of a sudden there's three huge fast-paced action sequences in less than an hour. In fact, the film only seems to get good about an hour in. Too much information is given, and the outcome is so predictable that I knew how it would end less than halfway through. Also, the romantic aspect was much too cheezy and seemed to not only go overboard (and I *hate* Hollywood endings! Should have had a Ronin ending...) but seems to have little relevance. And while we're at it, Billy's character needed more screen time and more importance considering he was supposedly a member of the 'team'. Actually, it didn't seem like much of a 'team', should have been more team oriented action. I though the first action sequence (invasion of chem company) should have happened much earlier, which could have set up the story in a more interesting way (oh, nice touch to have an almost identical drop as the first film). As it stands, I liked the climbing scenes (Iko Iko was a nice touch - exact same music as opened Rain Man...coincidence?? I think not;) I liked the attempted theft scene. However, the Hopkins scene was tedious (too long and poorly scripted) and the car chase was frivolous (gotta have those chase scenes!!) and the romantic scenes were simple a waste of time and film.<br/><br/>The final two action sequences were vintage Woo however. The film picks up and *bam* great choppy repeat cuts, great stunts...and Cruise was *almost* convincing with that amusing martial arts/WWF kicking style...if only Ving Rhames had a bigger part...<br/><br/>Overall: this film was snazzy. It had spit-and-polish but wasn't *too* glossy. And although I don't expect intellect from a M:I film of all things, at least it could have had a decent plot. But the classic Woo action scenes make up for it to a point; a single dove flying through the flames as Cruise walks by...visually stunning! 7/10."

","I am currently watching through all of the Mission Impossible films, and two and three were the only ones I hadn't seen before. I had heard that Mission Impossible 2 was bad, but three was a definite improvement. I have yet to watch the sequel, but I have to say that I agree with the general consensus on this film.<br/><br/>It's a shame because most of the first act was actually quite good, and I was starting to feel like this might be an underrated film. Then, as it was transitioning to the second act, it lost all of its momentum. To be quite honest, it became boring and a slog to get through.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise was great, and I actually think his performance in this film was even better than the first. The relationship he shared on-screen with Thandie Newton, who people know of nowadays as Maeve Millay from Westworld, was sweet and I enjoyed the dynamic between them.<br/><br/>The breaking and entering element about half way through the film was executed very well and it was a tense few minutes, but that was definitely the last good part of the film. The back half was quite poor, and this made for a film which was a drastic step down from the greatness of the first Mission Impossible film.<br/><br/>I didn't find the story to be all that engaging as it progressed, with a weak script and an overuse of sexualising Newton's character to get what they needed from the villain.<br/><br/>I'll be watching the third film in this franchise soon, and I am still looking forward to it. Even without seeing that film yet, Mission Impossible still has a terrific first, fourth, fifth, and sixth film, making this one of my favourite franchises of all time, even if Mission Impossible 2 is the weak link.<br/><br/>SCORE: 47%"
"TheMovieDiorama","5","0","0","9 March 2019"," Mission Impossible 2 is set on slow-motion ""Tom Cruise"" control.
","De Palma's film adaptation of the television series knew what it was. A fun, slick spy thriller that acknowledged how ridiculously crazy it was. Woo comes along for the sequel, with his more serious tone, and instead of chanting ""woo hoo"" he sees audiences chanting ""booooo hooooo"". Completely unrelated to its predecessor, Ethan Hunt is tasked in bringing down a thug who plans on releasing a dangerous virus for money.<br/><br/>A generic story that could've come from an earlier Bond flick, but atleast it's functional. Occasionally engrossing, especially after the tediously dull first half which sees a woman being used as bait, with consistently good performances from everyone. Cruise harnesses the physical prowess of an IMF agent, and Newton is just stunning. Their romance is somewhat underdeveloped and all too forced, however it gets the job done. Zimmer's score also seems a little out of place during certain scenes, almost acquiring this spiritual vibe. Small criticisms here and there.<br/><br/>The major critique however is the film's pacing. When the most exciting scene for the first hour is a one minute montage of Cruise climbing a cliff, something is not right. The action, or lack of, is then diminished entirely by the obnoxious use of slow-motion. Nearly. Every. Thing. Is. So. Damn. Slooooow. The plot is about an hour, yet the film is dragged out for two hours just so we can see Cruise twist and twirl in the air in choppy slow-mo. The style is fine for certain scenes, but to overuse it actually detracts from the thrilling action, consequently making it boring. If anything it made me admire Cruise's luscious locks as it slowly flows in the gentle breeze. The antagonistic rogue IMF agent, played by Scott, wasn't exactly memorable and weirdly concludes with a showdown on a beach. Mano-el-Mano. No wait, sorry. Manooooo-el-Manooooo. Thankfully the preceding motorbike chase was filmed well, so there is something to take away. Everyone knows this is the weakest in the series. Limited action and a long drawn out generic plot isn't exactly a success..."

","Mission Impossible II Doesn't live up to its predecessor's potential, and takes a new turn.

"a_chinn","7","0","0","25 June 2018"," John Woo leaves his stamp on his one Mission: Impossible film
","I remember after seeing this film being very excited about what I though was going to be a unique action series where each installment would be directed by a distinctly different director who would leave their own unique stamp on the series. The first film was directed by master of suspense Brian De Palma and this first sequel in the series was directed by John Woo, the most famous of the Hong Kong action directors, who brings his ""heroic bloodshed"" type of story and action to this mega budget Hollywood production. Woo's best films, or at least his best known films, are ""The Killer"" and ""Hard-Boiled,"" both stories about two men on opposite sides of the law, but who in many ways live parallel lives. The story here has echos of that sort of mano a mano battle between two ying and yang type of characters, but not to the extend as Woo's Hong Kong pictures. Now I'm writing this review couple weeks after having watched the film and I'm barley remembering the story, which kind of makes sense since according to co-writer Robert Towne (Star Trek writers Ronald D. Moore & Brannon Braga received story credit) said that much of the script was written around action scenes that Woo told him he wanted to be able to direct for the movie. What I do remember of the story is that Dougray Scott is the bad guy who has some sort of deadly bioengineered disease and it's up to Tom Cruise and Thandie Newton to stop him. Although it's not all that memorable of a story, and this was reportedly a conscious decision by the filmmakers due to the criticism of the first film received regarding it's overly complicated plot (which it was), but what is memorable about MI2 are Woo's directorial stylistics. All of his usual trademarks are presents; zooms, slow motion, people firing two guns, birds flying in slow motion, etc. and although the action is not nearly as wild as anything in ""A Better Tomorrow Part II"" or ""Bullet to the Head,"" it's unmistakably a John Woo action scene. I remember being disappointed in the action at the time, but rewatching it now, I can appreciate all that Woo did bring to the film. Woo also brings a number of memorable non-gunplay sequences, including a car chase between Cruise and Newton early in the film, which plays out more like a dance than a William Friedkin or Walter Hill style of car chase, or the climactic fight between Cruise and Scott on as rocky seashore that's a wonderfully loopy genre mash-up; part Hong Kong heroic bloodshed, part spaghetti western, and part straight-up American fight scene. Woo's first cut of the film came in at three and a half hours, which is obviously not the film that was released, but how fun would it have been to see that director's cut of an epic length John Woo film with all the budget and trappings of a major Hollywood studio allowing him to indulge in slow motion tracking shots of big name stars in their sunglasses, or close-ups of clothings, or birds, or whatever else Woo felt needed to be added to build his sense of atmosphere and cool? The movie was also originally given a R-rating and had to have the violence edited down to a PG-13, which is another reason it would be fun to see Woo's three and a half hour crazy violent version of this film. And interestingly, Woo was not the first choice of director on this film. Cruise originally offered the job to De Palma, but he declined. The job then went to Oliver Stone, who if you remember has not always done heady dramas, but wrote come classic action films including De Palma's ""Scarface"" and Hal Ashby's ""Eight Million Ways to Die"" but Stone had to drop out due to scheduling conflicts when Cruise's ended up having to work an extended amount of time on ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" directed by Stanley Kubrick, who was notorious for the length of his shoots. Overall, MI2 is absolutely a John Woo films, even if it's a bit watered down for mainstream audiences compared to his Hong Kong films, and although ""Face/Off"" is still Woo's best American production, MI2 is a solid credit to Woo's filmography and I would argue is better than ""Broken Arrow."" (I'm not mentioning ""Hard Target"" because I have a pretty big soft spot for that film and it may be my favorite of Woo's American films, even if I can't quantify an argument as to why it's a better film - maybe it was Wilford Brimley riding a horse in slow motion.)."
"Vartiainen","Null","0","0","24 September 2014"," About as decent as the first one
","The first Mission Impossible was a fun little action romp and one of the few films where I could stomach Tom Cruise as an action star. One of the few would also include this second installment in the franchise, where Ethan Hunt (Cruise) has to join forces with a professional thief Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton) in order to stop a deadly virus from falling into hands that would turn it into a weapon.<br/><br/>I think I prefer the original over this one, mainly because it had a slightly rawer edge to it and had the novelty on its side. This movie feels just the slightest bit safer than the first one, and we don't really learn anything new about Ethan, though he remains as likable as in the first film.<br/><br/>The sequel also maintains all the good elements. The excellent action scenes, the phenomenal special effects (at least for their time), the fun characters and the plot lines that are fun and silly, but not too much to distract you from the action.<br/><br/>If you liked the first one, I urge you to give this one a watch. It's more of the same quality."

Its simple and overall just nothing special. Tom cruise is good as always in the role of Ethan Hunt but the villain and supporting actress are dull and stereotypes of James Bond characters.<br/><br/>What's steals the show are two thing: the 3rd part of the movie and the style and the way John Woo manage to do those two things together and almost feels like poetry: the sunset, the locations, the fight at the end and the music theme with electric guitar feels like a good mix. John Woo manage to do a pretty good job despite all the flaws.<br/><br/>Overall its not bad if you want a good time check it out but don't expect a masterpiece.

Yeah, I knew what was going to happen before they were going to happen because I've seen parts of it before but this was still an entertaining movie for me.<br/><br/>I got annoyed with this one problem though: It's when characters take their masks off revealing another character.

I also didn't think that Thandie Newton was a good love interest for Tom Cruise. But to say for their performances, they were good.<br/><br/>The cinematography was really well done and the score was really relaxing. This felt like a laid back film. It wasn't all too serious and had some humor in it and you can't deny you wouldn't expect some clichés and cheesy one liners in here. The locations in the film was also very beautiful. The action sequences were amazing and thrilling.<br/><br/>I can say this film was as good as the first film and has great action sequences. It's a perfect popcorn movie for those who haven't seen it yet and it's entertaining, although it isn't as close as the first or third Mission Impossible films. Fasten your seatbelts because you're in for a kinetic ride!"

His trademarks are still there (maybe even (en)forced by Tom Cruise, who is also a producer here, besides the fact that he has the lead role). Yes there is not much plot/story ... you could even say none at all. Still I found it better than making one up (such as the BS from part 1). And it makes the whole film more ""believable"". More believable in the sense that you know, you are in a ""world"" that isn't real! So scenes like the motorcycle duel can happen won't bother you or take you out of the movie.<br/><br/>Yes there are things, that still are bothering even me (7 out of 10 isn't a perfect grade). For once the scene, where Thandie Newton and Tom are in their cars and are spinning around in slow motion. There are people who really hate this scene. I'm just gonna say that it is to long!

","Every director has his own sense of style. Brian De Palma is a Hitchcock stylist while John Woo is pure action. With the first Mission Impossible, De Palma made it slick and intelligent with a very in dept story line and crafty action. Woo on the other hand makes Mission Impossible 2 a low key love story filled with explosions and boring dialog. Woo diverts all our attention away from the previous M:I's feel into a whole new setting with a whole new tone. With Woo's non-stop rush of adrenaline, he turns Ethan Hunt from a cool super spy into a hardcore daredevil.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise makes his return as Ethan Hunt, a spy who is on holiday climbing cliffs who happens to be called in on a very impossible mission. Seems as though a rogue IMF agent, played by Dougray Scott, has crashed a plane and kidnapped a top secret disease only known by it's name, Chemira. Hunt is assigned to enlist a jewel thief to help find out the agents plan. Along with Ethan comes his super hacker pal Luther Stickell, played ounce again by the brute of a man Ving Rhames. Together, Ethan must save the world and the girl who he has fallen in love with. Wait, a love story in a Mission Impossible movie? That's what Woo is giving us? <br/><br/>John Woo is a good director, I'll give him that, but he should have left this movie alone. Brian De Palma had already set up a clever spy franchise and Woo took it down within the first ten minutes when we see Tom Cruise scaling a cliff like he's Spider-Man. Ethan is totally different here than in the previous movie, looking like a regular Steven Segal poser. The acting is worse than part 1, total boredom. Woo, instead of entertaining us, bores us to tears. And the villain is horrible. The plot is a deflated idea used over fifty times and yet Woo decides to pump it up with air again and use it. The special effects, alright. We get some good CGi here and there, and an excellent shot of an knife about to stab Tom's eyeball out, but sense it's six years later after this movie was released, it's old.<br/><br/>The only real saving grace is the action. Woo throws in as many bullets and explosions as he can. We have a cool motorcycle chase, a glass room shattered to pieces with bullets, exploding sun glasses, and even a two man wrestling match atop a hill. Sadly, the action itself is either to slow or too fast and it looses it's willpower. The movie acts like a Dawsons Creek episode, a love triangle while death is involved. Sorry Mr. Woo but this movie was pretty bad. My advice to all the viewers out in the world, see Part 3. JJ Abrams made the best one, cooler then De Palma's and makes Woo's looks like trash. Mission Impossible 2 gets a 6 out of 10. C- on my grade."

","MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE II ***1/2 After a genetically modified disease is unleashed into a large corporation, IMF agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) returns to retrieve and extinguish it before it gets into the wrong hands. This is pretty much what the storyline entails, with Hunt (once again) recruiting a team to get the job done, including a mysterious thief (Thandie Newton) whom he has to send into dangerous territory. This sequel takes a backseat to the first-rate storyline of the first one, and essentially brings an in-your-face blend of action and special effects to the table. It's not as entertaining, but director John Woo is clearly competent in what needs to be done."

","The opening credits sequence is excellent: Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) climbs a mountain with his bare hands; once he reaches the peak, a chopper shows up, shooting a missile on the ground. This missile contain a pair of sunglasses, thanks to which Hunt receives instructions concerning his new assignment, followed by the famous line ""This message will self-destruct in five seconds"". He then tosses the glasses away, their explosion forming the movie's title. That scene, alongside the spectacular motorbike chase, is M:I:II's highlight. Otherwise it's just an ordinary, predictable and pretty stupid action flick.<br/><br/>This time, Hunt and his partner, Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) have to stop their former colleague Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) from infecting the world with a deadly virus known as ""Chimera"". In order to succeed, they need help from Nayah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton), Ambrose's ex, who's now dating Ethan. You can easily guess the rest...<br/><br/>Like his predecessor, Brian De Palma, action guru John Woo favors style over substance. But De Palma had a good script to work on. Woo, on the other hand, hopes the audience won't notice the narrative flaws, so that he can offer us his visual trademarks (slow motion, doves etc.). Unfortunately for him, we do notice the flaws: for one thing, the love story is quite insipid, and it's also given too much room (no prize for guessing how the film ends: it's SO obvious!). In addition, the characters stink: Nayah is still passable, but new sidekick Billy Baird (John Polson) was completely unnecessary. Why not just leave Luther alone? And Ambrose is a crappy villain: in Scott's hands, he looks like a stereotyped caricature of a respectable bad guy. Still, Cruise and Rhames make a great spy couple, and Anthony Hopkins'uncredited cameo as Hunt's supervisor is very enjoyable, particularly his infamous remark: ""Mr. Hunt, this isn't mission:difficult, this is mission:impossible. ""Difficult"" should be a walk in the park for you."" Pity the same can't be said of this film's director."

If they could have combined the two styles then it would have been one kick ass film, but as they didn't it left me feeling rather disappointed after the first film.

"fishpoo","6","0","0","11 May 2003"," A comparison of M:I-1 & M:I-2
","Mission: Impossible 1 is a movie about an agent getting framed and then solving a mystery. It's more of a Thriller than an Action movie. Mission: Impossible II is a completely different kind of movie. It's just like every other average action movie: Lots of action, not much plot, a boring bad guy and a good looking woman.<br/><br/>Mission: Impossible 1 is definitely a much better movie than M:I-2. But it does still have quite a few flaws. I often have trouble following plots. But after watching Mission Impossible twice I still don't understand all of what's going on and I don't think I'm the only person who has this problem. This doesn't stop the film from being entertaining, but it's a bit annoying. I think I understood everything in M:I-2, not that there is much to understand.<br/><br/>What annoys me the most about Mission: Impossible 1 is the fact that Jim (Jon Voight), one of the most important characters, isn't around for most of the movie. So his character didn't really get very developed. As for Claire, I don't think the movie would be any different if she weren't in it.<br/><br/>The characters in Mission Impossible II are more traditional. The villain is someone who used to work with Ethan but has now turned bad. He has a Scottish accent, to let us know that he's the bad guy. If Ethan's boss hadn't said anything, I would have never guessed that the villain and Ethan worked with each other. They seem like complete strangers.<br/><br/>My favorite part of Mission Impossible 1 has got to be the bit where Ethan and his gang steal information from the computer in that room with all the high security. I've seen it spoofed in quite a few other things. M:I-2 doesn't really have anything like that. Except Ethan Hunt retrieving the disease. But that wasn't really the same thing and it just turned into a big action scene with lots of guns. Stuff like that isn't very entertaining these days. Most of the action scenes in M:I-2 also involve loads of slow motion. This is just annoying and not cool.<br/><br/>Overall I give Mission: Impossible 3/5 and Mission: Impossible II 2/5. I hope Mission: Impossible 3 will be more like the first film."
"Emerenciano","8","0","0","7 April 2003"," Really good!
","""Mission: Impossible II"" is a typical action movie! There's all you want when you watch a film of this genre: motor bikes, explosions, fights and an atmosphere of danger in the air. The central plot is quite fictitious, but it's good! I felt it lost something important when compared to the first movie, the art itself. De Palma's direction, besides the wonderful scenes of action, added some mystery and beauty to the story, something John Woo couldn't do. It's something too subjective to be described in a few lines, but watching this second movie makes we realise De Palma and Woo have different points of view. This is positive, because we can compare them and make our conclusions. ""Mission: Impossible II"", although without De Palma's style, is really good. The story is carefully built and it proves John Woo is one of the best action film directors we have nowadays. The scene where Tom Cruise's character and the bad guy take part in a motor bike pursuit is brilliant.<br/><br/>

What's so secret about trying to save the world from a madman with a deadly virus?  The whole point of IMF was to do things that the government did not want anyone knowing that they are doing.

","A sequel to the original espionage thriller, M: I 2 goes along a completely different style, but fails to live up to its predecessor. The main reason for this is that a different director created it. While the first one was original, complex and thought provoking, M: I 2 takes on every cliché in the book. In the first one Tom Cruise was out for revenge, here he's on his `next mission'. The sequel tries much too hard to duplicate James Bond and far too little on script and storyline. Let's face it, the plot is a complicated muddle from start to finish. <br/><br/>Tom Cruise takes on the lead role again but plays a completely different character. While in the first one he was a paranoid, unsettled and confused man, here he is a lot more focused, but overly slick and too much of a James Bond wannabe. Thandie Newton isn't a bad love interest, but doesn't do much to get past her one-dimensional demeanour. Dougray Scott is a relatively harmless villain and seems very inappropriate for the role.<br/><br/>
The stunts are well done and the overall effect is good, but the film falls into much too many plot-holes to avoid. Many people have been criticising the `mask gimmick' but I thought it was quite cool, even if it was lifted straight out of the first one. Overall M: I 2 isn't bad but it isn't really that great either. A day after watching it you'll probably have forgotten about it. <br/><br/>The fact that the series began on a level of spy game paranoia and then plummeted down to mindless action nonsense really is a downer. Because of this, the film fails to be much more then mediocre. 5.1/10."

So when I heard that there was to be a sequel I was pleased- so trotted off to my local movie emporium to see it. The fact that it had John Woo directing it (whose other big Hollywood movie ""Face Off"" was great fun) just added to my expectations. Two hours later I came out of the cinema in silence. It was that bad.<br/><br/>The main problem with it is the screenplay. It provides the crew with little sense of either character or substance. The plot is comically contrived and the characters are immediately dislikeable. Woo obviously decided to try and cover the lack of substance in the script with flashy direction. However this highlights the movie's faults even more with a hugely narcissistic opening sequence which makes Tom Cruise appear to be some kind of false idol. <br/><br/>What this film reminds me of, is Armageddon, the ill-fated 1998 disaster flick which has inspired so many rants on the imdb.

This is a decent outing as a James Bond copy, though it still bothers me that it wasn't just given a different name.  Also another complaint is that all of the mask stunts and even the cigar cutter thing were copied straight from Darkman.  I would recommend that any of you who thought the mask stunts were good to go out and rent Darkman (it's a lot better at pulling these stunts off).  I will give this movie credit for acting.

","I just rented the video tape and I was kind of puzzled.  It seems like several of the scenes were changed from the movie.  <br/><br/>I distinctly remember Tom Cruise smiling during the scene when he slipped on the cliff.  This time he grimaces.  When he sleeps with Nyah he seems to kiss her more. When he tells Nyah he wants her to sleep with Sean, I remember a scene focusing on his face while he looks off the balcony, which seems to be missing here.<br/><br/>Would someone tell me: Am I imagining all this or did they re-edit a lot of it?  Actually, it seems to be improved.  Maybe I should just see all movies twice.  I get things out of them the second time that I didn't the first time.<br/><br/>Maybe it just works better on a smaller screen, but I thought the chemistry between Ethan & Nyah was better and the slow motion scenes worked better. Somehow the slow motion scenes took the suspense out of it for me on the big screen -- actually they drove me crazy -- but on the small screen they seem to work better.  Also I could see the whole of Tom's face better on the small screen and that made his acting look better.  Perhaps most importantly, I could turn the volume down on my TV, which I couldn't do in the theater, which helped a lot, since the volume was WAY too loud in the theater.  <br/><br/>It's sort of funny.  I thought movies always worked better on big screen, but maybe not.<br/><br/>Anyway, the video tape has a very pleasant documentary at the end about how they did the special effects and developed the story.

While it does have it's good points - some great action scenes and a great cast - it's let down by it's predictability, clichéd 'good-guys-always-win' ending complete with good guy gets girl, bad guy dies and good guy saves the world. It didn't even feel like M:I since the mission was not that 'impossible' in the first place. It's more an action movie than part of the 'Mission: Impossible' series.<br/><br/>But it does have one major point in it's favour: Dougray Scott as Sean Ambrose. Intelligent, charming, charismatic, sensitive and complex, Sean unfortunately makes Ethan Hunt look insipid and weak and to a point, irritating. I was rooting for Sean the entire movie, despite the fact I knew without a doubt he would be killed. He alone makes it worth watching more than once.<br/><br/>Such potential wasted, could have been far better if they'd stuck closer to the original series/film and not gone for mainstream appeal of basic plot, plenty of explosions, clichéd ending and ignoring the original premise which made the series, and first movie, so popular."

","When I sat down to see M:I-2 my expectations weren't very high, the trailers I'd seen didn't seem to promise much. Still, after having seen the film I was quite baffled over how enormously bad this movie was. The first M:I film was criticised for having a plot that was very hard to follow and this one certainly is no improvement.<br/><br/>From the very beginning I found myself wondering a lot of what, why, and who's until I just didn't care anymore. The villain's reason for doing what he is doing, (and just what that is), is never really properly explained. And while I felt that the first film at least was shot in an appealing way and added a dark touch to the secret agent story, M:I-2 is nothing but an orgy in effects and Woo's unimaginative, and ugly, slow motion action sequences. To call it action is probably an overstatement too as nothing really happens for the first hour of the film.<br/><br/>Those who expect to see some cool gadgets will also be disappointed since the film just contains a multitude mask changes and the same kind of Cruise-hanging-from-a-rope scene from the first film. As for Cruise's character Ethan Hunt, he has gone from being an agent to a comic book action hero with superhuman powers. In general, the film and characters are just silly, and the ending looks more like it belongs in a Steven Seagal flick.<br/><br/>As 1 is the lowest rating on IMDb, that's what I give it, but of course it's really too high."

M:I-2 was much easier to follow and there was MUCH MORE action. I loved the special effects and the music was so good. And as Thandie Newton put it, ""Beautifully orchestrated fight sequences."" I thought the acting was so good. Dougray Scott played an awesome bad guy. Tom was much more aggressive. He also showed his amazing athletic ability. Thandie Newton was also great in this film. The places the movie was filmed at were beautiful. The action was so awesome. I haven't seen that much action in a film since Speed starring Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock. One of my favorite parts in the movie is when Tom walks across a room surrounded with fire in slow motion. The fire is reflecting in Dougray's eyes and Tom has suck a slick and angry look on his face. It's one of those good guy and bad guy have an eye-to eye moment. The music playing on the part fits that moment perfectly. Everyone disagrees with me, but that is such an intense part in the film.

","The sequel to a very successful, albeit lousy, 1996 thriller is John Woo's follow-up to his very successful (and delightful) ""Face/Off"". This time, however, Woo doesn't have the same kinetic energy that made ""Face/Off"" so entertaining. The stunts, by comparison, are somewhat restrained, the plot not as convoluted or compelling (even if the script is by the revered Robert Towne) and the acting is anemic, a far cry from the over-the-top scenery chewing of Nicholas Cage and John Travolta. Tom Cruise, as hero Ethan Hunt, has a presence but only the right directors can exploit it (Paul Thomas Anderson comes to mind) and Woo's interests are far from acting. The rest of the cast is comparably weak, including Thandie Newton, Dougray Scott, Ving Rhames and, in a cameo, Anthony Hopkins. With no personal investment to speak of, the film comes off as cold and methodical, designed solely for big bucks at the box office. Cruise may simply have more of a financial involvement (he's one of the producers) and he seems to be marking time between more interesting projects."

","This is an exciting and stylish movie with a thin plot.  But who wants a plot?  I was never a MI fan, but I know the answer to that question. There are so many inventive and jaw-dropping stunts that visual interest never slackens - and this point, after all, is the reason to enjoy the missions. Of course they're impossible, and so is nearly everything that happens in this movie.  Tom Cruise (star and co-producer) knows exactly what he wants to do, and he does it extraordinarily well.  We ignore any yen for realism: the fun comes from the impossibility of it all.  Lots of racing and crashing cars, a joust on motorcycles (really), and all the preposterous but fascinating techno-rubbish that MI buffs love so much.  There are also 4-5 of those tiresome trademark face-peels.  They're technically well done, but the concept somehow exceeds impossibility.  If that's possible.  The movie is purely a series of exciting and climactic exploits.  They don't build, they accumulate, like a scrapbook of heroism.  Unhappily, there's no tour-de-force sequence here, such as the stunning chopper-in-the-Chunnel masterpiece in the first `MI.'  Closest to it, for me, was a gratuitous but great rock-climbing adventure near the very beginning of the movie.  It was filmed on the sheer red cliffs near Moab, Utah, and the DVD extra dealing with this piece is fascinating.  Most of the disk extras, however, add up to a paean to Tom's skill and courage in doing much of his own stunt work. They're worth watching anyway, and a couple actually tell us a bit about the creation of some of the startling effects.  But the movie takes itself very seriously.  I'm about 80% sure that's a fault.  Might it have been more fun if it had been less earnest?  Would audiences enjoy a chance to grin now and then, to break up the sustained sense of awe?  (Is awe a flaw?)  Perhaps we'll find out in the next MI.  PS: The last names of Thandie Newton's character are Nordhoff-Hall.

But after a strong first half-hour or so, this movie goes straight downhill.

But as soon as her role trailed off after the opening hour, the movie went straight into rote action-movie, big stunt mode.  <br/><br/>The plot is virtually just a device for the usual Woo scenes.  I felt he brought a great sense to the relationship between Newton and Cruise by his use of camera style and angle, though.  He ought to do a romantic film instead of getting typecast with his five minute fight scenes and over the top action trickery.<br/><br/>I'm somebody who loved the first Mission Impossible more than most(I guess) and liked the way DePalma directed it as well.

Movie, for film is not a proper word to describe this uninvolving, plodding, loud crash of cinematic debris.<br/><br/>Not picking up where Mission Impossible left off, M:I 2 brings Tom Cruise back as IMF agent Ethan Hunt given an assignment by Anthony Hopkins (inexplicably placed in a small, perfunctory role) who must stop European baddie Dougray Scott and American CEO Brendan Gleeson from releasing a deadly virus.<br/><br/>That's the extent of the story, and it's stretched out for an excruciating 2 hours of explosions, hilariously-bad dialogue, deadly-boring conversations, generic, one-dimensional characters, and of course, more explosions.  Tom Cruise's calculating, emotional Hunt has been replaced by an indestructible, slick, larger-than-life persona that in no way resembles the Ethan Hunt of the first film.  Before, he cared a great deal about his mission; now, he cares a great deal for danger and excitement, as clearly shown by the otherwise unnecessary, meant-to-blow-you-away rock climbing introduction.<br/><br/>Not to say that John Woo isn't a gifted action director.  Face/Off is one of the most stunning, well-executed, fun action films ever done.  However, it doesn't take itself too seriously, as the performances from Cage and Travolta demonstrate by exuding devilish wit and mischief.  Mission Impossible 2, however, attempts to cover up its lack of story with seemingly intriguing scenes of a blood-letting virus (seen before in Outbreak and its countless ripoffs), exotic locales inhabited by criminals (scene in countless crime films), and of course, over-the-top action sequences which in themselves may be cool, but that's all they are.  They don't really help further the story, because by the middle of the film, the story has gotten as far as it will go.<br/><br/>Screenwriter Robert Towne said his script was written according to action sequences dictated to him by director Woo, and it clearly shows. Mission:Impossible II is a collection of well-choreographed fight and grandiose action sequences, but that's it.  Paying no homage to either the intrigue, deception and constantly twisting episodes of the TV series or the first installment of the film series, Mission: Impossible II is a sequel reaching only for the green, assaulting viewers with image, hoping they will not notice its lack of substance.<br/><br/>4 out of 10"

","I don't care what anybody says.  I really like Mission Impossible 2.  Yes, the plot is non-existent, as are the characters.  But I think that people have become trapped by traditional ideas of plot and character. The best way I can describe MI:2 is as an action movie directed by Dario Argento.  Labyrinthine AND non-existent plot (that takes some doing), bizarre visual style (even for Woo!), and some really disturbing scenes about identity make this film, I believe, worthy of artistic interpretation. I'm about to start work on an essay comparing this film to Face/Off... they deal with some of the same issues....."

","Well let's say first off I like John Woo's work in almost every movie he's done and I still enjoy his Trademarks.  This movie still has them aside from the fact that there are considerably fewer shoot-outs, but when they happen they are great.  MI2 though was different then the first due to the fact that MI2 was a lot more like a Bond film where the lead character seems to go solo rather then a team effort like the opening scene of the first MI movie.  Still even if this movie seems to be more Bond Then MI I still recommend it.  The only thing I didn't like due to lack of originality but the action of it was still good (and this may be a spoiler) is that the final showdown seemed very much like the end another one of Woo's movies yet this time it took place on land rather then water.<br/><br/>My review is a 7."

","I hate to say it, but I'm a movie freak...but even I couldn't love this movie.  Although the amazing stunts with all the nice high tech equipment [and Tom Cruise's muscles] kept me quite entertained throughout the movie, the plots twists proved too much for something that's supposed to be a fun and entertaining movie.  I fear that if I would take my 11 year old brother to see it, he would be asked me questions the whole time.  But I have to admit, the helicopters, fast cars, and the motorcycles combined with the high tech villain [a deadly virus that that bad guy threatens to unleash in downtown Sydney] were pretty impressive.  Alas, I was told by a lab rat friend of mine [as in, someone who works in a lab at a university] that most injection guns do not come in shiny chrome.  But Tom Cruise, Dougray Scott, and Thandie Newton all do nice jobs of playing...well, who they are supposed to play.  And one last comment...isn't it sad that we're running out of villains?  No more Nazis, no more Communists....it's all technology now."
"diane alicia","Null","0","0","30 October 2000"," Woo handed impossible mission
","The problem with Mission Impossible II was the choice of director. John Woo, whose work shone in ""Broken Arrow"" and ""Face/Off"", is too serious and too stylized for the light-hearted, tongue-in-cheek tone set by Brian de Palma in ""Mission Impossible"" and the subtle, self-mockery of the television series. Woo brought texture and depth to the film's characters, creating in Sean Ambrose a villain who effectively upstages the paperdoll hero, Ethan Hunt. Unfortunately this isn't what ""Mission Impossible"" fans wanted from the film - nor are the shallow script and throw-away humor what Woo fans wanted from the director."

Those few moments that were really stupid and obvious on what was to happen next, such as the car chase on the side of the cliff, the mask change between Ethan and Hugh which resulted in Sean shooting his best friend many times! I knew straight away (before I saw the finger) that it wasn't Ethan Hunt, but Hugh Stamp! And of course, the moments when Ethan chucked the antidote for CHIMERA to Ving Rhames' character and managed to kick up the gun from the sand, go down and kill Sean Ambrose! Which is absolutely impossible, considering the amount of time he had and how close Sean Ambrose was behind him! Maybe that is why the movie was called MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE II III.

"Keyser Soze-12","6","0","0","23 October 2000"," A stupid action movie, not much more
","It is important to understand that this is not a sequel to MI1.  Mission Impossible 1 was a slick, intelligent, spy movie.  MI2 is not.  To compare the two movies is like comparing James Bond to Ronin.  The only similarity is that Tom Cruise plays a character with the same name from the first movie, IT IS NOT THE SAME CHARACTER!<br/><br/>First off, the difference in the movies are much like Tom Cruise's hair.  In the first movie, Tom's hair was short and very military like.  That's what the first movie was.  It was serious and centered less on action.  Tom's hair in the second movie is long and very California-ish.  So is the movie. It loses the military seriousness and trades it for action.  Tom Cruises character has also changed drastically.  He is now longer serious, but quite the opposite.  He is always smiling and happy.  ALWAYS!<br/><br/>
Now, I don't think that is a bad thing.  I liked this movie.  The action sequences are amazing, and with leave you breath less.  However, being a fan of the first film, I didn't like it as much.  Most people didn't like the first film because they couldn't understand it, Keyser Soze syndrome it's called.  So, if you didn't get the first film, you will like this movie.<br/><br/>However, if you enjoyed the first film and expected a real sequel, go rent Ronin."

","One the most techno-savvy movies released this year. Typical John Woo action, but this one's sure to give you goosebumps! The story line isn't given much importance, but more on the mindless action. There's so much action going on that you just get mesmerised by it. Loads of unbelievable (and cool) gadgets, make Ethan's role far too easy. And typical M:I 1 style, they keep on pulling their latex faces till you start doubting who the real character on screen is!!. The biggest plus point of this movie is the ground breaking music score by Hans Zimmer. I'm sure he's in for an oscar this time!!<br/><br/>Get ready for some real kick ass bike and airborne stunts. Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) shines in his role, as he is well suited for it. Nyah (Thandie Newton) is absolutely disappointing. Even worse, Anthony Hopkins' role is just 5 minutes long.

This one was not so good as I expected.<br/><br/>Yes, dynamic and dramatic scenes were here too. But they were lost in a lot of dust around. It was like this movie was patched up from pieces made by two or more directors. One great scene (Ethan hanging on the rock) was replaced by an awfully made scene (man shooting rocket with glasses) and vice versa. There was no really bad scene in the movie, they were only badly timed (bad moment, too long or too short).

You could really believe that these people cared for each other. I loved hearing Dougray Scott use his natural accent, and not British. And after not seeing Tom Cruise in much lately as I don't watch R movies, it was great to see him looking good in a role that was great for him.

"Samoyed","Null","0","0","26 August 2000"," Your mission is...
","... should you choose to accept it...<br/><br/>Let' s get one thing clear (referring to the posted comment) a movie isn' t always the true reflection of reality not even when it is set in real places with real things. Sometimes it is an unique world with its own rules and laws (of physics for example). Sometimes a movie when it is very realistic or even more can make you accept reality (and life) as it is or make you remember than someone' s reality is worse than yours. But sometimes a movie lets you forget reality for two hours taking you somewhere else and letting you take a break from your real world, your worries and your brain. A movie can be a very powerful relaxant. And one of these is Mission: Impossible II.<br/><br/>I' m not going to pick on the plot because it really does not have a primary role in the movie. It is simple and clear and you don' t have to twist your mind over it. It is light and easy to cope with. Good versus bad, that' s all. The dominant factor is the style. And if you know John Woo' s filmography you should know that style is his middle name (and not realism, see Face Off or Crying Freeman). The BioCyte laboratory scene is a great example of Woo' s surgical perfection and style. And when it merges with Hans Zimmer' s music (the soundtrack is great, but you should see the movie first) you are seeing one of the best if not the best action scene in movie history. And I think that the showdown on the beach will become the obligatory studying material on film schools for one on one close combat. If Face Off was Woo' s The Nutcracker Prince, M:I-2 is the Swan Lake. Perfect.<br/><br/>M:I-2 is the ultimate popcorn movie, when you shut down your brain and feast your eyes and ears. Worry free. And what concerns the realism lack, nobody went through the roof for M:I-1 and especially not for all the James Bond movies. Accept it or don' t. But don' t criticise it for what it is.<br/><br/>And to all those who say that is impossible, this is impossible let me rephrase the line of sir Anthony Hopkins: ""Mr. Hunt, this isn't mission possible, it's mission IMPOSSIBLE.""<br/><br/>This message will self-destruct in 5 seconds. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1..."

But the point is: Despite that, it's a lot of fun to watch. Choreographed action-scenes, minutely set in scene are John Woo's handwriting, and he continues the use of dramatic slow-motion sequences within them, as seen in ""Face/Off"". Some slow-motion combat scenes somewhat reminded me of ""The Matrix"", but they are not just a mere plagiarism. Tom Cruise is at his best as action-hero, but the storyline is unconvincing, and the storytelling is slow and tired in the middle segment of the movie. Writers Moore/Braga are miles away from their peak performances. Nonetheless, M:I-2 seen as a whole, is better than the first part.

They were the typical action scenes of any of the John Woo's movies, but exaggerated to the limit and with a not-so-athletic Tom Cruise. And what to say about the gun-in-the-sand final scene?

"Alcaminhante","Null","0","0","8 August 2000"," And i thought THE PATRIOT was bad !!! ...
","Warning ! This might contain a spoiler or two... Warning ! Stay away from this movie, it´s real bad !<br/><br/>I never thought a big action blockbuster, coming out of  Hollywood, could be like this. This movie is BORING ! It was the worst action movie i ever saw. I wasn´t expecting much out of it, but i sure wasn´t expecting it to be BORING ! What´s wrong with this movie ?!<br/><br/>It´s totaly uninteresting. The plot was already done a million times, and it seemed more like a rejected draft script from a James Bond movie than actualy a finished work. And the latest 007, was also a boring empty shell, but not as much as MI-2 is. This is almost unbelievable ! It begun pretty bad, with the usual ""classical"" car duel, between the hero and the movie babe. Everything was in place as usual, including the hanging above the abyss, race outcome, seen a million times in all the 007. And the initial seduction scenes, oh well... The villains are nothing more than a collection of clichés from James Bond, only this time, without any charisma or interest whatsoever, ruing all the threat. The bad guys are just there to loose, and that´s clear right from the begining. Even if it wasn´t, Tom Cruise´s character is so undestructible, that ruins any chance of suspence. There´s never a moment in this movie, where we feel Ethan Hunt is in danger. We already know that he´s going to make it out alive ,in a very cool and spectacular way. The audience just waits for the next spectacular scene to happen. And i loved the way, the bad guys waited for him to put his shades on, before they start shooting, after all, after MATRIX, what the public wants is to see coolness. New action heroes don´t even have to be brave, just be cool. And by the way, how come this movie looks like a fashion-world commercial most of the time ?! In some scenes i was even expecting to see a shampoo Logo right across the screen. It´s hilarious !<br/><br/>The suspence scenes had no suspence. That one in the race track was already done everywhere else. The shooting action scenes were empty and impersonal, with lots of bullets flying through the air, with bad guys shooting security guards and Tom Cruise shooting anywhere. And all this filmed in such a politically correct way that it made everything look phoney. All this amount of action, which was only spectacular and nothing else, reminded me of a big budget episode of The A-TEAM. Lots of shooting but no blood , or realistic killing scenes. While at the same time it pretends to be a very serious spy thriller. . This is the type of movie that gives children the idea that shooting people doesn´t hurt. And this gets even more dangerous because this movie was trimmed to be so politicaly correct, to aim at that particular audience. The only audiences that are going to take something out of it, are the young audiences of millions of early teens or more physically mature but braindead popcorn eaters,  who are going to think this is a great movie because of the cars, the bikes, and because it looks cool.<br/><br/>This movie gets so boring, that it even repeats the same scene with Tom Cruise hanging from cables like in the first episode. We can see this is going to be a trade mark, and i can´t wait to see where they are going to do it next time. The scenes where there is no action are boring, because the characters are just made of plastic. That so-called love story, gets ridiculous, because it´s just there as a set up for something we know it´s going to happen later, and it´s never credible. Anyway all this gets totally redundant, because despite the outcome of the love story, we can already guess, that the girl is going to get killed right at the beginning of MI-3, because Tom Cruise is going to need another Bond Gir..., sorry girlfriend next time. So who cares !<br/><br/>The secondary good guy characters do nothing on this movie, and are there just to make Tom Cruise look good, wich is a shame because they could have been great characters, if this MI had kept the team spirit of the original series, instead of becoming a new super hero movie. By the way, if you liked Thandie Newton, who plays the girl, check the movie BELOVED, where you can really see what a fantastic actress she is. There is nothing wrong with the actors on MI-2, the only problem is that they are all limited by this screenplay for children. But Tom Cruise must have had plenty of fun.<br/><br/>And if you want to go see this movie, because you´re a John Woo fan, forget it. This isn´t a John Woo movie. It´s just a movie he was hired to do. What´s left here is a strange mix between something that sometimes wants to be a John Woo film, but never allowed and some shampoo commercial.<br/><br/>A terrible, terrible movie. The only thing good about it, are the masks. Which i´m sure John Woo must be wearing one right now, hoping his fans won´t hit him to much for creating such a Hollywood product.<br/><br/>If you want to see a great american John Woo, see FACE OFF instead. That´s everything MI-2 should have been."
"Benjy","5","0","0","7 August 2000"," Action action everywhere but nothing makes you think.
","John Woo fans, you will probably not be disappointed. Anyone wanting some more of the semi-cerebral plot of the first movie will be. As with all of Woo's movies, the action scenes here certainly do not leave you wanting. They are on the whole quite simply stunning. Is there anyone that can combine John Woo's ability to produce great action allied to such beautiful choreography? Probably not but there is pretty much where the superlatives end. There's a paper thin plot, poor dialog and actors who seem to be going through the motions. Thandie Newton looks stunning and should go onto to better roles and there's some promise as a Bond Villain for Dougray Scott. Tom Cruise had just begun to build himself up a reputation as a serious actor, while MI:2 doesn't shatter it, it hardly enhances it. Physically though he is superb, his stunts fantastic his movement sublime. Emotionally he's a wet fish. Ving Rhames is capable of much better, will someone write this man a good role again? Overall not a disappointment, but nothing to write home about either."
"slam163","4","0","0","4 August 2000"," Mission Implausible: the new Bond franchise?
","A handsome secret agent, beautiful women, fast cars and fight sequences, plus a megalomaniac with a fiendish plot to hold the world to ransom: sound familiar? Yes, MI:2 is squarely in James Bond territory. In fact, I couldn't help wondering if MI:2 doesn't amount to a conscious attempt to take over the Bond market niche now that the Bond theme - despite the reinjection of Pierce Brosnan to try to kick some life into the series - is so clearly played-out.<br/><br/>In fairness, this is a shrewder idea than having MI:2 follow in the steps of the first ""Mission Impossible"", a movie that tried to be dark and brooding and merely ended up tedious and occasionally baffling. MI:2 is popcorn, but at least it seems to want to be enjoyable popcorn. Unfortunately, the director doesn't appear to have any idea of how to achieve this: as a result, the film simply goes through the motions for a couple of hours, and then gives up.<br/><br/>Centre-stage, as ever, is Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt. Or is that Ethan Hunt as Tom Cruise? The distinction between star and character can seldom have been more blurred, especially since Hunt doesn't appear to have any kind of personality to call his own. When Tom Cruise performs the free-climbing sequences - Hunt's idea of a holiday - are we watching Ethan Hunt's idea of a holiday, or Tom Cruise's? Of course Tom Cruise is an actor, not a secret agent. But Hunt seems to have so little character, and so few defining characteristics beyond Cruise's boyish good looks, that to all intents and purposes they might as well be one and the same.<br/><br/>Cruise, to give him credit, does his best. He smiles and leaps and kicks people and runs and looks nice. Alas, the same cannot be said of Anthony Hopkins, who appears to be acting in his sleep. (He was very nearly acting in my sleep too, but I kept my eyes open somehow). The spectacularly bad lipsync that plagued much of the movie is also at its worst in Hopkins' scenes: I felt as if I were watching something that had been dubbed from German.<br/><br/>Thandie Newton is another disappointment. The casting agency were apparently given the difficult brief of finding someone prettier than Tom Cruise for him to act with. With the heart-breakingly gorgeous Newton, they clearly succeeded. Her early scenes also suggest that she can act as well. She has the makings of an extraordinary, memorable Bond, er, Hunt Girl. Given free rein, she could probably have transformed the movie. But her role simply dries up partway-through, leaving her little more to do than look hurt and vulnerable for the rest of the film. It's a terrible waste.<br/><br/>'Wasteful' would be a good description of the film as a whole. It's as if the director knows that he won't be asked to direct MI:3, so he's using up all the cliches in the genre while he has his hand on the clapperboard. If the MI series is the new Bond, it's peaking early: two films into the series, it's already fallen into the formula rut. It's also sloppily done: the 'need-to-know' information about the virus is repeated over and over to make sure we've got it (clue for Hollywood: audiences aren't as stupid as you think they are). The trademarks - Hunt dangling from a rope as in the first movie, and John Woo's pigeons - are fairly trowelled on, and the plot-holes come thick and fast. Most irritating of all, the 'face-mask' gimmick, where characters pull off a latex mask to reveal that they are actually someone else, is repeated over and over, without rhyme or reason. To use this trick once tests the audience's ability to suspend disbelief already: to use it as often as MI:2 does, in such implausible circumstances, is sheer laziness. After a while, you're all but expecting Thandie Newton to rip off her face-mask and reveal that she's actually Anthony Hopkins.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, MI:2 takes itself too seriously for that: the only moment when it comes close to self-parody is when villain Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) gives a sardonic commentary on Hunt's plans to infiltrate a building. For the rest, there's little humor in the film (and several of the scarce jokes come across as oddly misogynistic). Tom Cruise's po-faced Hunt can never deadpan the way Bond would, which is bad news for the series: now that Bond movies have become thoroughly formulaic, the occasional dry wit is one of the few redeeming devices they have left. If MI:2 can't even manage that, future sequels will have little to recommend them.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, car chases and explosions are no longer enough. Despite all the pyrotechnics and the slow-motion aerial kung-fu, the one truly vivid scene in the film remains the rock-climbing sequence at the start. Without any need for quick-fire action, with no enemies except gravity to fight, it's nonetheless genuinely tense and gripping. If Woo could have offered more scenes like that, MI:2 might have been superb. Alas, it's a solitary high-point: nothing else in the film ever attains that level again.<br/><br/>If Mission Impossible wants Bond's crown, tarnished and tired as it is, the makers will need to do better than this. Simply repeating the usual cliches with nicer photography and a bigger special effects budget won't cut it, no matter how cute Tom Cruise may be. If ever there was a series in need of a new direction and some original ideas, this is it."

A good one at that but still a disappointment. I'm also not a very big fan of John Woo. Technically he's brilliant ofcourse but he doesn't know how to develop a story. Dialogue in his films is always sentimental and corny. The action-sequences are very fast-paced but too outrageous. All these slow-motion shots make the whole thing look like a circus-show. And where do all these doves keep coming from? Doves don't belong in bunkers! Woo is taking this whole dove-thing to far. Can't he be subtle for once?

","We who have seen the original show with stars Steven Hill, Martin Landau and Peter Graves expect, as in that show, lots of super-critical situations to be team-solved with extra-intelligence by a group of ultra qualified agents. What we obtain in Mr. Woo's movie is nothing but highly violent action and Jackie Chan acrobatic stuff mixed with High Tech Gizmos and environments and Once a Thief's slow motion resources. OAT was the very one really superb thing that came from Woo, but that simply doesn't work in MI2. Cruise works here as a one man team, just as if it happen to be Bond's Goldeneye or Tomorrow never dies (which, as a matter of fact, are not even a shadow of Connery's Bond movies). It is clear that there is a misconception of the title, certainly. It didn't happen to be Mission: Impossible or 'Mission: Difficult', but Mission: Absurd."

The plot was interesting, I enjoyed the intrigue and intensity of the first two thirds of the film. However,for the last 40 minutes, the movie became an absolute drag.  How long can two men chase, punch and fracture each other and remain credible. Even in boxing the round ends, the bell rings, and we get a break. Action is fine when it makes sense and expands the story.  Bur when it becomes action for its own sake and just goes on and on, it becomes just a mindless mess.

","Good, popcorn entertainment. Despite the plot having been done before (see Outbreak), the corny dialogue, and underuse of talented actors/actresses (Newtons character seems to veer from mind-numbingly naive to extremely streetwise to fit the plot) this film is okay if you want to see a half decent action film. Jon Woos symbolism is extremely good (all the elements make an appearance!), I particularly liked his Angel vs Satan bit in the storage compound (Cruise striding past the flames with a dove superimposed as the avenging angel and Scott with the flames reflected in his eyes as Satan).<br/><br/>However, the science of this film is appalling and gives a bad name to those in research. It is ironic that at the same time this film was shot in 1999, on the other side of Sydney harbour, an important virological conference was taking place, at which were many scientists who work on Influenza virus. What they obviously wanted to portray was an Ebola-like virus, but they could not because it has already been done,as I said before.

But this movie seemed to have the production values of your average TV movie. We didn't even see the plane crash at the beginning, just a cut away to the opening titles.<br/><br/>A decent motor bike chase just isn't enough to save this movie from being moribund.

","You cannot enjoy this movie if you are an aficionado (like I<br/><br/>am)  of the TV series. What made the success of the TV<br/><br/>series was the quiet and steady method used by Jim Phelps to accomplish the mission he chose to accept. Action scenes were kept at a minimum to enhance the suspense and illustrate the clever plot. Both movie versions of Mission: Impossible are far away from the TV<br/><br/>series. I guess Tom Cruise wanted to do a 007-like movie<br/><br/>and he came out with the idea of re-modeling Mission: Impossible for this purpose.<br/><br/>MI2 contains all the ingredients of a James Bond movie:<br/><br/>The super-spy himself who works alone (Cruise), his boss<br/><br/>M (played here by Anthony Hopkins); Q, the hardware guy<br/><br/>(Ving Rhames is the alter ego of the late Desmond Llewelyn); the Bond girl (Thandie Newton who strangely<br/><br/>reminded me of Catherine Zeta-Jones in Entrapment); and<br/><br/>last but not least the car and motorcycle chase scenes.<br/><br/>The analogy goes as far as Nyra asking Hunt : ""Who are<br/><br/>you?"" and the reply comes naturally: "" My name is ..."".<br/><br/>
Both movie versions of Mission: Impossible contain a strong and powerful message: All spies are villains. In both<br/><br/>movies the evil man is a member of the IMF team. I wonder<br/><br/>what made Anthony Hopkins have confidence in Tom Cruise if (almost) all his spies are potential traitors! I<br/><br/>guess we will have to wait for MI3 to find out.<br/><br/>The action shots of the movie are well done. The exaggerated slow motion (c.f. Matrix) is there to clearly<br/><br/>show us that it is Tom Cruise himself who is doing the<br/><br/>stunts. Even the cliche of having the villain wake up (after<br/><br/>he was believed to be dead) to deal the final coup to the<br/><br/>hero is used to illustrate the prowess of Cruise as a stuntman.<br/><br/>All in all, it is a good spy movie with a simple plot and a lot<br/><br/>of action.

Firstly, with the writer/s, who appeared to have created a one hour script and decided to pad out the rest with gunfire and an incredibly protracted punch-up.

Second Let me mention this movie did NOT fail because it is a sequel I believe, but it insults the audience.<br/><br/>Mission Impossible 2 has great music, great sound, great actors and intriguing ideas yet shallow Story line.  But the complaints come from 2 parts.  The story line is shallow and then it is repeated. there is enough flashbacks in this MOVIE (which they seem to forget they are making) you might think you were at a Grateful Dead concert, and some of those flash backs intertwining two different dialogue.  It is hard to tell what is what. Is it so hard to remember the FIRST scene? why do they insult the audience that way, not all of us are morons.  Then they remind us of the MAJOR key scene in the final fight?  Why do they call us idiots like this?  It is sad.<br/><br/>But that is not worst they could do.  There are some GREAT action moments, unfortunately they are ruined by the over use of one major special effect, SLOW MOTION!!! This movie's action scenes each have a slow motion.  If the producers saw Matrix they could understand that slow motion might be good in moderation, but the way they use it in this movie, it is like over using crack?  anyone else notice that?  What are they hiding.... the fact the action only takes up about half the time it seems, maybe less.  They just want you to think it takes up more.<br/><br/>Then there is the romantic story?  again? the producers are morons.  We don't want to know romance. Action movie watchers want Sex, Violence, and Blood, And not too much romance but there is too much romance and talk about romance, and not that much skin.  I don't care if someone wants to protect someone I want to see them do it, oops I just remembered, they screwed that up too.<br/><br/>Don't go to this for any reason unless you NEED Tom Cruise or you will die. Other then him the only redeemable quality is the fact it is a John Woo Flick. or maybe the use of Slow motion (you better love slow motion)<br/><br/>Finally my recommendation? Get Matrix, and watch it again (always a good movie, and better done), or for theater fanatics go see Gladiator (great action flick and expertly done) or go to this awful movie and hope not to get p***ed off at John Woo's big bomb."

Hey,what do you expect - Pinter?   The hokey plot borrows from any Bond movie - pick one at random - and this spy-turned-traitor business is getting real tired.   However, some of the action sequences are eyecatchingly staged even when the fight scenes drag on ad nauseam, and if John Woo's trademark balletic slo-mo shoot-outs are getting a little tiresome, well there's always Limp Bizkit on the soundtrack."

"Chris-448","4","0","0","22 July 2000"," The behemoth of average action movies
","This movie was one of the most hyped of the year, so perhaps that was why, on leaving the cinema, I was considering how appalling it was. The acting was reasonably convincing, which probably threw the whole saga an enormous lifeline, but the plot and stunts were ridiculous. Director John Woo slowed every stunt down to slow-motion, which was annoying the first time and inane from then on. Woo did bring some memorable set-pieces to the movie that will probably be spoofed time and time again, but these gains were bombed out of the water by the most ridiculous script I have ever seen.<br/><br/>The plot was lifted straight out of a Bond movie, except that this film had none of what makes James Bond such an engrossing action hero. Dramatic stunts are supposed to astound the audience, not make them mutter, ""yeah right,"" under their breath. Why did the whole story revolve around face masks (a rip off of ""Face/Off,"" surely?). Why does the IMF have to shoot missiles at Cruise while he's scaling cliffs? Why does a truck, after smashing into and destroying a car, keep on driving? Why is one of Cruise's assistants prevented from escaping from a bomb because some small wires gnaw at his coat? Why does Cruise wait so long to destroy the last sample of Crimera? I was laughing at this film because, despite its gloss and its questionable Bond-by-numbers format, its essence (perhaps apart from the rock-esque soundtrack) was farcical.<br/><br/>To be fair to M:I-2, the actors were pretty much top-notch. Cruise obviously fitted the role well seeing as the whole movie seemed to be made for him, but Dougray Scott and newcomer Thandie Newton (who was, sadly, reduced to portraying a stereotypical ""damsel in distress"") were both excellent. Sir Anthony Hopkins added his unique talent too, and grabbed the best line in the movie: when Cruise complains that Naya is untrained and shouldn't go with him on his mission, Hopkins replies, ""To go to bed with a man and lie to him? She's a woman; she's got all the training she needs."" But the characters managed at least to interact with one another, which counts for a lot in action movies were it is usually only the most muscular or robotic actors who are allowed in.<br/><br/>So, some fine actors let down by miserable direction and some appalling goofs and plot holes as large as the Black Hole of Calcutta. That is what ""Mission: Impossible 2"" is. This movie is worth seeing simply because of what it is, but if you're looking for something with sophistication, humour and a touch of class, don't bother. This only manages a feeble 4 out of 10."

","The TV series featured a team of experts with the goal of causing something to happen without ever letting on that there had been any government intervention at all.  The trick was to pull a high tech con job on world leaders, high-rolling criminals, or whatever.  The technology was useful, but the psychological aspects were what made the show interesting. Jim Phelps had to pull off some very subtle acts at times.  That very light-handed approach was why the missions were considered ""impossible"".<br/><br/>
So what does Ethan Hunt do? Wreak havoc wherever he goes, it seems. No subtlety here, rather just an excuse to pack as much meaningless action into two hours as you can. I counted at least three opportunities to bring the mission to a successful conclusion that were missed or dropped. All so that we could be treated to an impossible car chase, an over-long fist fight and other inanities.  The stunts were impossible, the mission was anything but.

Horse racing in slo-mo, pigeons flying in slo-mo, oh and Mr. Cruise in the middle of it all being out-acted in one shot by a slo-mo dove! Also, the clumsy editing, which was made available by the direction. During the last fight scene, the action is split up by randomly placed shots of waves. The action scenes are there, they could have been exciting, despite the fact that we had seen all before.  However, the cinematography and the attempt at performing ballet in cars, on bikes and with disease infested birds brought me and my fellow movie watchers to the point of hysteria!<br/><br/>Summing up - There is a line in the movie where cruise is on his bike and he's aiming his gun at one of the villains.

","This film is definitely one of the best films of the year! As a classic John Woo film (lots of action and fighting, not a plot that is likely to up for an oscar), it should attract not only Mission Impossible fans but also die hard fans of the diverse director. The film begins, and all the people expecting action are relieved, as we are not only confronted with major fighting scenes, but Tom Cruise climbing up the side of a cliff. This particular scene takes your breath away, as you hang on Tom Cruise' every movement, and pray he doesn't fall, even though you know he wont. The film moves on and we are treated (well, at least the John Woo fans are) to a spectacle of action, stunts, special effects and beautiful direction, all leading to a climax. The final 20 minutes have you on the edge of your seat, even though you know a convenient ending is inevitible. As Tom Cruise battles it out with his arch enemy played by Dougray Scott, John Woo's talent for directing action movies becomes even more apparent.<br/><br/>I would also like to mention Thandie Newton, as she played the perfect 'damsel-in-distress' and performed her key role in the film with particular conviction (not to mention how hot she looks).<br/><br/>Overall this film has a fairly weak plot, but who cares, we weren't expecting an emotional masterpiece.

Dougray Scott tries as the villain, but he's not scary at all, just sort of mildly irritable.  After all, this is a villain who demands stock options as part of his bounty. (Truly, a sign of the times, and the audience laughed at that one.) Thandie Newton, who I had never seen before, is certainly beautiful, but she carries two expressions on her face through the entire movie, and resembles Ally McBeal in a tighter T-shirt.

His character is more of a James Bond clone than the character is the original movie; I admire his guts and fearlessness for doing several scenes (especially the opening one), and the truth is, he's not bad.

","WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SOME MAJOR SPOILERS. DO NOT READ UNLESS YOU'VE SEEN THE FILM!<br/><br/>Antony Hopkins bookends this film with a brief cameo as Ethan's boss. I dunno about you, but I find it hard to watch the actor nowadays without being constantly reminded of an advert he did for a certain bank, where everything was 'big'. ""There's a big bloke with a big bald head and he's eating a big bag of sweets making a big noise. Then there's five big girls having a big chat through the film and one's got a big smoker's cough and she's hacking her guts up in a big way. Then there's a big idiot who left his big mobile phone on and it's letting off a big ring"". Yeah, the cinema can be an annoying place sometimes. But back to the film. There's a line of dialogue where Hopkins describes how by using a female thief on the mission they will reward her by deleting her criminal record. The record, he tells us, will be ""expunged"" (pauses, then adds for those who don't know expunged means) -  ""wiped out"". The whole film is like this. Every time a vaguely clever plot point is revealed, the movie then immediately spells it out in bright big letters just for the members of the audience too thick to get it.<br/><br/>It's films like this that make you think you've either seen too many movies or that it's just blindly obvious what's going to happen next. This is no more apparent than with the wearily predictable series of face/voice doubles (c. Face/Off), the worst being Tom, running for his life, yet stopping to take off his mask. Hey, look audience! It was Tom all along! Even though the guy that looked like Tom is already revealed to be the henchman, here's Tom taking his mask off just in case you're dead from the neck up. Assuming, of course, you didn't know that the swap had taken place within the first five seconds anyway. See also: Oh My God, I cannot possibly guess what she's going to do with that hypodermic spray gun!!!<br/><br/>John Woo's direction is the big star of the show (and yes, Tom does get to do a ""jumping sideways in slow motion while firing two guns simultaneously""), the colour of the movie a pleasant autumnal red/brown in contrast to DePalma's original clinical winter shades. In fact, he's the ideal director for this outing, as, while the first had pleasing complexity, this one is a by the book (if not - quite - by the numbers) actioner. The plot is non-existent, a mere 10 minutes' worth of events, to whit: bad-guys-steal-virus. Good-guys-steal-back-virus. The fact that this thin premise is expanded to two hours means everything else is just irrelevant padding and trimmings. Look at the first fifty minutes. Cruise steals a chip that tells him the secret of the deadly virus (Clue: It's deadly!) Yet we knew that before the opening credits, so why do we need to wait for Tom to find out? Like Connery finding out how they stole the nukes in ""Thunderball"", this is a time-filling game of catch-up. And surely his bosses would have known what the virus was capable of anyway? This is expounded by a fat Englishman in a hospital who only exists to give the most blatant display of clunky exposition I've been privileged to witness. Except he comes back to life or something, and I must admit I didn't get that bit, I was distracted - keep the noise down with those sweet wrappers!!!<br/><br/>Dougray Scott is good as the Scottish (what, not English?) villain who pronounces Ethan's surname like it's a form of East End rhyming slang. Thandie Newton's appearance in the first half of the film revolves around her breasts, while the second sees her redundant and looking pensive to what sounds like the lovechild of Clannad. Ving Rhames is Ving Rhames; the cool-sounding stereotypical black guy that does all the work while the Caucasian with the impossibly white teeth gets the glory. I half expected his credit to read ""Uncle Tom"", but I was left disappointed.<br/><br/>Things to look out for: a blatant steal from Darkman (and I'm not talking about the faces - think cigar cutter time) and an ending which - perhaps geekily - reminded me of the last McCoy Doctor Who story. Except that after the Doctor did a motorbike clash, he didn't end it by beating the crap out of the Master in a martial arts video game that went on and on and on for fifteen minutes. Maybe I'm just not enough of a bloke to appreciate it, but my testosterone is of a controllable level, so that I don't watch karate fights that bore and go ""Wow! That was way way cool!"" I just think - where's the plot?<br/><br/>If this were the first film in a franchise then I would be predicting its demise. As it's a continuation from a superior original then I guess it does a reasonable job of treading water and will ensure that Cruise will once again take on board a mission that is, if not impossible, then moderately entertaining."

An exception because this one now has a sequel.<br/><br/>  The original movie made a massive profit even though it caused massive headaches with its confusing story. But this time around things have cooled down a little with a plot that can just about be followed if you give it your full attention. The mission here is to find and destroy samples of a new and deadly virus. Sounds simple enough, but this is of course Mission: Impossible, with the impossible element being that a group of terrorists being led by a former IMF agent (Scott) are also after the virus and need it for their own schemes. Things do get a little mixed up along the way but I don't think anyone is really going to care much to notice.<br/><br/>  Things start off quite nicely with a hijack heist and then an impressive rock-climbing stunt! But moving on we then see that this is easily comparable to a Bond movie with a romantic relationship between all the action. Newton plays the love interest. She plays her role quite well at first as skillful thief, brought in to be part of Ethan Hunt's IMF team. But later she ends up having to be rescued in true James Bond fashion and doesn't do very much (or even talk) towards the end of the movie.<br/><br/>  It's always good to see characters returning in sequels and Rhames making a comeback in this was a welcome sight. But, even though they aren't characters, there aren't a lot of those unique gadgets from the original, the kind you wish you had in the school playground, such as the glasses with a tiny camera and the explosive chewing gum. But to replace that there is an excessive amount of ""cool"" in this film such as fast cars and bikes, explosions, an array of sunglasses (which Cruise wears with great skill as they hardly ever fall off from his face). And then there's probably Cruise himself, looking impossibly like the whole ""cool"" package, getting whatever he wants (after all, he is also the producer as well as the main star). Unlike in the original he gets to use a gun this time around  actually make that two guns! With John Woo as director you've got all his trademarks thrown in such as his famous two-handed gunplay, innocent looking children, lots of slow motion shots and not forgetting the white doves! The action is there but things don't warmed up till half way through.<br/><br/>  In the end we just have an action movie with a story that tastes like cereal with beer. It's pretty much style over substance but at least it's John Woo's style! It is quite a disappointment (you seem to expect much more from such a film) but it's still a watchable blockbuster, which is fun at times yet it's far from being great.

Brian De Palma made a fine conversion from the TV series, ya know, incredible ""James Bond""-type situations, suspense and elaborated plot... But this film isn't ""M:i-2"", it's just ""How to be a pretty action hero, kill some bad folks & win a beauty girl"".<br/><br/>I'm not saying that ""M:i-2"" is crap. It's not. But I see it's nearer the HongKong-type films than the M:i TV series.<br/><br/>Despite the result of the film like a Mission:impossible sequel, John Woo fans will love it. It has all the small things that make Woo's creations different: fantastic shooting scenes, incredible camera movements, spectacular one-to-one fights, awesome pursuits and, of course, a very good-smart-handsome hero and the bad-to-bone villain. And the pigeons, of course :)<br/><br/>Just one thing: M:i-2 affirms that typical sentence: ""2nd parts aren't good"". It's not as good the first one, but it's not a bad film. If you're looking for action, technology, incredible situations, beautiful women and a very cool Tom Cruise, you'll get it! 7/10"

","Cruise...Tom Cruise.  Bond gadgets, bond plot, bond girl. It took two films, but Cruise has successfully turned the team-oriented Mission Impossible genre into the watch-Cruise-go genre with James Bond flavoring.

"modius","Null","0","0","10 July 2000"," I was disappointed
","Mission: Impossible 2 was disappointing and could never exceed or even meet its overhyped advertising or its hard rock and roll image.  I am a John Woo fan, and I've seen many, but not all of his films and I have to say that I don't think Woo's heart was in this film.<br/><br/>Unlike the first Mission:Impossible film this has an easy to understand plot mixed with a hybrid of a 1980's like action film and a weak script. This is nothing like the first Mission: Impossible or even the brilliant tv show. Hunt is not the human spy but an all-out one-man hero who can do everything himself.<br/><br/>Where's the teamwork, the credible plot twisting or the intelligent use of gadgets?  I was expecting John Woo to have gone back to the TV show and brought out what made it good and gave us something special - for example I wanted to see John Woo make one IMF team play against another IMF team (a sort of cat and mouse game on a big scale).<br/><br/>The plot of M:I-2 has Dougray Scott's character (an ex-IMF guy turned bad) stealing a super-flu virus and is hoping to sell it to some chemical company and make tons of money on the stock market whilst Hunt (Cruise) must recover it with the help (or lack of it) from Newton, Luther and Richard Roxburgh.<br/><br/>The romantic connection between Newton and Cruise was fine, the spanish dance scene was eye candy and showed what direction was.  Newton and Cruise did really well to hide the script and bring out a 'love' story. Unfortuently this is destroyed when Newton (who is a master thief) turns into a damsel in distress.  Her master thief skills were never really used.<br/><br/>I agree with most of the reviewers who say that the film seems to be from a rejected James Bond script.  In fact most of the film seems to come from old James Bond or John Woo films.  For example, you have the two characters who are exactly alike and hate each other (taken from Face/Off and GoldenEye).<br/><br/>The direction of this film was great, but not Woo's best.  I was expecting (espically after the Matrix) Woo to have really overused the bullet time, swing round shots, but he only used it a few times.  Some of the direction was masterful, others tired.<br/><br/>Sometimes I felt Woo put things into the shot because people were expecting to see them (for example the doves or the two guns in slow-motion, etc) and Woo was never given the chance to tweak or invent new twists on his direction style.<br/><br/>Some of the scenes were silly such as the huge number of cgi-enhanced rubber masks - where did they get them all from?  The motorbike scene was well executed, if not silly and over the top, ends in a face/off that is reminist of Bruce Lee's ""The Big Boss"".<br/><br/>Anyway this film is fine to watch, the action is fine (but nothing beyond the ordinary), the script is weak and deserved someone proofreading it, the direction is good but not masterful.<br/><br/>All in all it was enjoyable film, but I kinda felt like this film never really pushed the boundaries or action-direction any further.<br/><br/>If they want to make M:I-3 then they need to work on a good complex script with twists, turns and a good workable plot - bring us back to what made the TV show so successful and not to what Hollywood expects is successful."

","First of all, I have to say that I love Mission: Impossible 1 and the Sixties TV show. M:I-2 is a bad sequel for both. The first half of the movie is an acceptable action movie, although I miss the certain ""Mission: Impossible"" touch. This special touch can only be felt at the scene where Ethan Hunt intrudes into a skyscraper, although the scene reminds me too much of an overdone version of the ""computer room"" scene of the first movie. After that scene the whole film is unrealistic in a way that you constantly feel it. There are too many unanswered questions (""how could Hunt have enough time to apply the mask to himself and his enemy?"",...) and the whole thing with the motorcycle (which looks pretty cool in the trailer) is overdone. If a car hits a motorcycle from behind Hunt has to fall down! The last scene also was much too unspectacular in comparison to the rest of the movie. Two guys fistfighting might not be apropriate for a movie full of explosions and secret agents flying through the air. At one point when I was in cinema, everyone laughed out loud. In the same time the bad guy shoots at Hunt/Cruise, Hunt is able to - Throw the Virus to Luther - (physically impossible, looks terrible) kick a pistol in front of him into his own hand - and shoot the enemy.<br/><br/>Everybody who liked the first part should stay a way from the cinema."

Tom Cruise has gotten beyond Risky Business -- he's a real actor now, as Eyes Wide Shut shows. Actually, he's the best thing in the whole film.

The shoot-em-up motorcycle chase, that was a thrill--one of the best chase scenes I've seen in a long time, too bad about the farcical chicken race at the end.<br/><br/>Still, the story was good, I would have liked to seen it a bit more developed, but this is an action flick after all.  The high-tech gadgets: COOL!  the heroine's safe finding/breaking equipment--straight out of James Bond.  The exploding sunglasses were a bit much, but I think it was a plus that in the end, our hero didn't rely solely on gadgets, but did things the old fashion way -- tough guy style, like the original Bond (read the books.)<br/><br/>OK, this isn't a gripe, but I thought the bad guy was just a really bad actor.  Totally exaggerated.  Is this guy supposed to be ruthless or just a big loud ego?  Very flat character, not at all matching Cruise's subtle and balanced acting.<br/><br/>If you liked Romeo Must Die, you'll like MI2.  If you thought it was shallow, you'll think the same of MI2.

The face swapping thing is cool (At least they kept something from the first part!) but then it gets over exaggerated too. I was expecting Ethan Hunt to pull his face off and reveal James Bond, because this movie is trying to be too much like the James Bond series.

Hay, it is Mission Impossible, Tom Cruise doesn't want to ruin his childhood series, he will make sure that John Woo will compensate the story with a lot of action. But 'o my god' what did they do? Anthony Hopkins in MI2 for 4 minutes, changing masks all the time (about 30 times), multiple loose ends, John Woo's doves flying all over the place but now John Woo sees it as art and leaves the film for what it is. Nice shots from dancers and horse riders are stretched for minutes, what a bore... What happened to the original series style? There was no humor in the movie; when Ving Rhames asked Tom how the situation was on the island Tom said 'Risky'. Why didn't he say 'Risky business'? That would be a nice inside joke!

","OK, first things first, this film is not a comedy...so why did I laugh more during its viewing than I ever have before in the cinema? Let me tell you:  The major point of sheer humour was the ever shifting accent of the main bad guy's henchmen (who's name sadly eludes me).  It seemed to drift somewhere in between Irish, South African, German and Australian (perhaps he's a really frequent flyer).  The acting in the film is sooo bad!  From The female leads drunken stumblings (signifying the advanced stages of a super virus no less) to Tom Cruises' senseless mugging and the most hilariously over emphasised pronunciation of the word ""Loo"" from my favourite hench-goon.  The plot is possible the worst I have ever seen (and I am including every film I've watched through MST in this) and involves more 'characters not actually being who they look like but in fact wearing masks' than should ever have been allowed.  This film probably took about 15 minutes to write!  So, why oh why did John Woo ever decide to direct it?  In a film with about 20 minutes of decent action in its 2 hours running time, why on earth did he think he could make it worth watching? Woo is a superb director of action movies but a lot of the slow-mo in the more sedate scenes just seemed unnecessary  and down-right pretentious.  The final quarter of an hour was superb however.  The 'battle on bikes' was great and the final fist fight was entertaining if not really that impressive in terms of Martial Arts.  But then again, as soon as the pre-credits action ceases, the film falls into a pit of irredeemable boredom where the 'plot' is 'explained'.  My god, its so bad they even seemed to be apologising for its lameness by saying lines like ""Couldn't be simpler"" after explaining away some massive development in a few astute syllables. Frankly, this film was always going to be bad, but I was expecting a a piece of entertainment saved by its wonderfully entertaining action (a la Broken Arrow) but instead we have a wonderfully placid, souless piece of garbage based on classic Hitchcock with a smattering of entertainment towards the end.  Even the trademark Woo double gun action looked toned down in comparison with the ridiculously great, tile splitting, plaster showering lobby scene from the Matrix!  Now that the world has the Wachowski's, Woo has lost his originality and unique talents.  We now know that there IS someone else out there who can do it just as well as he. In all, if you're a fan of MST, go see this film for its unintentionally hilarious appeal, but if you're after an all out action fest you're going to be deeply, deeply disappointed."

In the first movie, the IMF team was what you would expect out of a team of secret agents, but in this movie not only was the team not well organized, but the team leader was on the other side of the world making a fifteen second appearance throughout the entire movie.  Now I wasn't expecting the leader to turn bad in this movie (It was an IMF agent again surprise surprise!) but even before Phelps(IMF leader in the first M:I for those who never saw the movie)did turn bad, he was there with the team leading them. I think the only good action scene in the movie was the very beginning when Ethan climbed the Plateau(or whatever) with no supports.  The rest were either similar to the first one or hard to believe even for an action movie. That surprised me about John Woo, considering I liked Face Off.  I thought the script of this movie killed the good acting of both Tom Cruise and Ving Rhames did in the first Movie. As for the super-human karate kid part, Cruise was doing moves which I've seen in Jackie Chan movies which I like but not what I expect out of a secret agent.  Also after all the explosions and stunt the only injuries Cruise gets are at the end and that's two cuts.

Or consider the motorbike chase:  things like these _don't happen_. When Roger Ebert reviewed some action movie the other day, he observed that the action scenes could as well be performed by Bugs Bunny, because you're always aware that no human being will ever perform these moves without massive support from the vfx department.

Right to a fault.<br/><br/>You may say, hey, its a proven formula, why not stick with it. So, yes, M:I2 does have some good action, some great action. If that is what you came to see, that is what you are going to get. Some good action.<br/><br/>The thing is, I expected so much more from John Woo. I knew he was going to destroy everything the original stood for and turn it into an action movie with kung fu, explosions, and who can forget, pigeons, and I was absolutely blown away by Face/Off, and excitied by the M:I2 trailer, so what then was the problem. Well... I suppose my expectations may have been too high, exciting yes, but new, different or special, no. Just above average really.<br/><br/>Then the plot... uh, well, usually in action movies they spend as little time on the plot as possible. This, however is a Mission: Impossible film so you must, must include all sorts of espionage and hi-tech bits and pieces and face swapping (what do these people conveniently walk around with a bag with other peoples faces in it). So a lot of time is spent on plot, while it is paper thin they've tried to complex it up, but they still cannot save it. Just another terrorist thriller plot. Should have just left it as an excuse for more action. And the romance, the supposed backbone of the story, well, although Thandie Newton is one sexy lass, it is a thoroughly rushed, unbelievable, and subsequently indifferent romance. Who cares? I didn't. And John Woo, master of the over the top, who pulls of brilliant action scenes, explosions and slow motion hero shots in Face/Off, which was just over-the-top to begin with so it was a lot of fun, here though every thing is taken to seriously and Woo's direction just seems off the mark, tacky, and in the case of Tom Cruise's hero shots, dare I say, homoerotic. All this and the returning characters from M:I were bastardized along with the rest of it. If you want good action, see the movie, if you want to see a landmark action film, wait for another."

","Is hard to understand how, with all that money and talent, somebody manages to make a movie as boring as this. Besides the scene on the cliff (memorable) and the re-make of Ethan Hunt plunging into the abyss... I couldn't stop yawning. To be fear, John Woo -besides making nice stills from Cruise and Thandie Newton- did pretend nothing else.

","The Main Thing by nicardo@bigfoot.com Review of Mission: Impossible-2<br/><br/>The most impossible mission in Hollywood, if you choose to accept it, is very clear. There seems to be no way, even spending many millions of dollars, to create an action/adventure movie that is actually believable. Can't seem to be done. I know movies are fiction, but how come when they push that envelope, it ends up bursting at the seams? Do they think we won't go see it unless it's a comic book on celluloid? Super-humans with powers far above those of mortal men battle brains and brawn for the safety of mankind. Give me a break. <br/><br/>One of the things you have to admire about the old TV series was that no matter how difficult the situation or how impossible the odds, the IM Force always stayed within the bounds of reason. They used brains, skill and luck to accomplish their goal, often with last second timing, but they never caused this viewer to remark, `Uh, yeah, right...'<br/><br/>This movie not only provokes such comments, it seems to encourage them. `You think that was impossible? Watch this!' Scene after scene we get subjected to things that would not and could not ever happen. Who asked them to take the title so literally??? Yeah, it's escapism. Just suspend your disbelief and sit back and `enjoy' if you can.  <br/><br/>Tom Cruise, actor/producer had to make a sequel to the confusing previous effort because it made more money than any movie he's ever done. He must have been in a hurry, too. He replays Ethan Hunt the super spy, and master of disguise, and master of weapons, and hand-to-hand combat, and computers, and motorcycles, and mountain-climbing, and master figuring out everything the bad guy is going to do before he does it. <br/><br/>The team? He only needs a couple of guys in the background (Ving Rhames and John Polson) and one female to serve as bait (Thandie Newton) in order to thwart the plans of a vicious ex-agent (Dougray Scott) his right hand man (Richard Roxburgh), and AN ARMY of henchmen.  Newton's character is also the ex-girlfriend of the bad guy. Clever, huh? (yawn) She's some kind of professional thief. Just perfect for a save-the-world-type mission, huh? Since Ethan doesn't get out much, and most of the women he meets end up dead before the last reel, he quickly falls in LOVE with Nyah (Newton). Maybe because it's rated PG-13, but does this falling in love so quickly bother anybody besides me? I saw the same thing happen in `The World is Not Enough,' where Pierce Brosnan fell for Sophie Marceau in a matter of minutes. Then later, he falls for Denise Richards in a matter of seconds. Lust? Okay. Happily Ever After? Please...<br/><br/>If you want senseless, pointless, violent, comic book style action, then this is your cup of TNT. Cruise joins Arnold and Bruce in the realm of action, noise and indestructibility, seeking only big box office totals, rather than excellent, intelligent, admirable film-making. Just as long as you know what you're in for. That's the main thing. Comments and e-mail welcome."

","I think M:I-1 had a much better plot. At least, it DID have a plot. If there is any plot at all in M:I-2, it's carefully disguised in a rubber mask. The formula for making this film was: get a James Bond film, remove all the girls but one, put in some Jackie Chan gymnastics, and add a few rubber masks. Anyway, those masks are great for the suspense, you never know who is who.<br/><br/>For an action fan like me, this is a very good film, as one could expect from John Woo. Very dynamic, if you know what I mean. At several points, I thought ""Ouch! That must hurt!"". The action scenes are well distributed along the film, with the power steadily increasing to the breaking point at the end. The motorcycle chase, in particular, is among the best chase scenes I have ever seen in the movies.<br/><br/>To enjoy this film, turn off your left brain hemisphere and activate all your adrenaline receptors. I rather liked it, but not too much. It's more like ""Mission: Frenetic"". And it should have more, prettier, girls. I give it a 6."

I was predicting every single thing that was going to happen. I don't want to give anything away, but I'm pretty sure you'll guess it ten minutes before it happens. <br/><br/>The first M:I was smarter and didn't rely on shooting someone every five seconds. It was more of a ""spy movie"". This is a brainless action film that makes you forget about spies instantly. I was expecting more originality and a cut-down on the cliches since it took so long to make this movie. It seemed longer sitting through it."
"hawk_6215","Null","0","0","1 July 2000"," Its strength and creativity comes in its action, not plot
","I was one of the few people who actually liked Mission:  Impossible.  I liked the plot...it was nearly impossible to understand but it knew that and didn't try to make it any clearer.  It had so many turn-backs in the first 30 minutes that you realize if your going to try to keep up with whats going on in the story it's going to be a waste of your time.  Nevertheless it was fun seeing the characters, who seemed to know exactly what was gonig on even though the screenwriters didn't, and it had a very good high tech heist scene.<br/><br/>In Mission Impossible II they decided to go a differint way, instead of bringing a maze for a plot they use a simple, cliched plot thats easy to follow.  The problem is, it isn't easy to care about.  The characters are alright, I liked that Australian dude.  It seems that Tom Cruise is a little full of himself, I kinda think hes a wuss.  In this movie he tries to make himself as pretty as possible...his wavy hair is shown in slow motion during one of the car chases and the light catches his face perfect every time. But he runs like a chiken.  Im surprised he kept that shot in the movie.<br/><br/>When you put the predictable plot aside, however, you have some of the best action sequences ever shot.  I never saw any of John Woos earlier stuff, but I can tell he has a gift.  He can make even a simple scene with a man climbing a mountain breathtaking.  The characters in this movie fight like gods...but thats the way it should be.  If these characters were anything close to real they'd all have been killed by the time the movie was over. The only weak part about this is the fact that Tom Cruise is playing one of these god like characters.  I just can't picture him doing anything athletic (look at how he runs).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Overall, the movie earns the following awards:  BEST Action Sequences of 2000, WORST Plot and Characters of 2000, and WORST Casting (another problem is they advertise Anthony Hopkins as the star and he has 2 scenes total) IT scores an average rating of ""Pretty coo if you're not in the mood for thinking but for lots of explosions and dying people."""
"luxury2","Null","0","0","1 July 2000"," No Emotion, Just Pimping
","I find it hard to decide which ""Mission: Impossible"" I found more nauseating.  Though I enjoyed the (rather predictable) plot and action sequences of the first ""Mission,"" I could not stand the cutesy posing in the beginning of the film (almost purring, ""Yay, we could be on a sitcom""), and the manipulated aftertaste it left once the team was killed off.<br/><br/>
So, with this new ""Mission,"" I was happy that we did not have a smirking ensemble to kill off--  It was nice, tight trio, as I imagine might happen-- You tailor the teams to suit the mission.  Yet this team was even more blah and lacking in personality than the first team.  Did I even care about the Australian member of the team?  The helicopter might as well have been on autopilot.<br/><br/>Could this lack of characterization be because of this sickeningly sexual focus of the film?  In the previous MI, there was sexual tension, but no sex.  Just what an action movie should provide.  But here, not only did we have to suffer through an unnecessary sex scene, but through a plot which depended on the practical pimping of the normally self-possessed Thandie Newton to Dougray Scott?  Ugh.<br/><br/>I do not think John Woo is really made for making the typical American action movie.  In John Woo's homeland action pictures, the action is almost family-based--  On revenge for a brother, defense of a loved one, creating/restoring relationships in the midst of violence, etc.  With this state of mind, you can accept the corny visual embellishments, such as the glowing white dove heralding the arrival of the ass-kicking hero, the slow motion....<br/><br/>This sort of camraderie, intensity, or affection is totally absent from MI2, and makes such emotional visuals ridiculous.  The embrace as Ethan and the bad guy leapt from their motorcycles--  This seemed to want to imply that they felt something for each other, but I could not accept this in the sterile context of this film.  No history was there or ever displayed.  The whole course of events is an assignment, not a labor of love.  This may be said for John Woo's job as well as Ethan Hunt's.<br/><br/>Focused on sex, yet there is no affection to make you accept or enjoy the story.  Dougray Scott portrayed the most sympathetic character in the movie, yet it all seemed rather affected.<br/><br/>However, this movie was more of its own movie than its predecessor.  I'm glad it is trying to cut the cord between the movies and its cheesy TV progenitor.  However, whether standing on its own merits or propped up by the TV show, this film was a disappointment."

I personally wish Tom Cruise had short hair in this one just like the first one.  The action scenes kick it all over the place, and Cruise moves with more grace in this one.

The thing that really bothered me is with everything these people can do you would think they could come up with something more clever than having this woman go back to her ex-boyfriend.  That's why it's called Mission Impossible.  It's not supposed to be simple but that's not what they did.  Instead of coming up with a super suspense action movie with a ""clever"" plot line we are reduced to seeing the rock and roll tidbit of her walking along the dock to her ex-boyfriend in slow motion and then if that wasn't painful enough we must then watch a sequence where he grabs the scarf as it goes flying in the wind as if it was such a powerful scene.  Agony!!!!! It's a bad sign when you're hoping that the girl WILL kill herself in the end just because she's been so annoying throughout the whole film as a woman who started out with promise and ended up being the wimp needing the man to save her.  Rubbish.  I hope no one decides to come out with a third one.  I don't think I could take another movie with MORE slow motion sequences."

","The latest 007 flick directed by John Woo...Wait a second...This isn't a Bond movie it's Mission Impossible II.  But how can that be.  The main character has amazing technological gadgets, he's trying to save a beautiful girl from an ex-spy and he's trying to save the world from a horrible biological weapon.  It must be James Bond's latest adventure.  Cool cars, lots of guns, disguises....oh there it is, this is a Bond movie in disguise.<br/><br/>Mission Impossible Two was an enjoyable movie, with some daring action sequences and a stellar soundtrack.  John Woo's unique flare for slow motion and endless moving shots shone through in this latest film.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise took more of a physical role in M:I 2.  Performing some truly breath taking stunts and getting involved in a few action packed kung-fu fight sequences.  His acting seemed to take second place to his martial arts and motor cycle chases.<br/><br/>Thandi Newton, played a typical bond girl role.  Her character is a thief who has to team up with Ethan Hunt to rescue the world from an ex-spy. She shoes some strength in certain scenes but is ultimately just another woman for the mighty action hero to save in the end of the film.<br/><br/>The story was lacking in intensity, the action was lacking in realism and the acting was just plain old lacking.<br/><br/>The high points of the film were John Woo's ability to transform a mediocre action scene into a ballet of guns and explosions.  The Soundtrack was quite unique, with some of the most unexpected choices in a movie to date.  And of course who can forget about Anthony Hopkins or Vingh Rames, both of these men managed to make a memorable appearance in the film.<br/><br/>All in all I would give M:I 2 a 6.9 or 7 out of ten.  It lacked the intensity of the first movie but made up for it in action."

Some of the scenes like on the bike was so unrealistic that the Hong Kong audience found it unrealistic (after being brought up on unrealistic martial arts film in HK, I would have thought we could have accepted this)...<br/><br/>The MI team is supposed to be a hi-tech team with lots of gadgetry like in MI part 1, but in MI2, we don't see much of this.<br/><br/>This is another run of the mill action film. John Woo's direction was disappointing, laboured over some of his trademarks such as the slow motion cam, plus the doves. The damn dove and the damn pigeons!<br/><br/>There are some good new tricks (like shooting backwards on the bike by looking at the rear view mirror), but the emphasis was not there. It didn't look as cool as it should have. I can't put my finger on the thing that ruined the film... but it definitely could have been much much better.<br/><br/>

This new MI movie is so focused on the action (you can thank John Woo for that) that there is hardly a plot at all. Sure, the action is intense, but a lot of it isn't believable at all, especially some scenes in the motorcycle chase. I don't know why they tried to turn Tom Cruise into a Jet Li, it just didn't work very well. The romance between Ethan and Nyah developed too quickly, so it didnt make much sense why they cared so much for each other, cause they pretty much just met. One more thing I didn't like in the movie was the overuse of the masks. In the first MI, the masks were used creatively and brought some big surprises. In this movie, the masks are overly used, and it's obvious to the viewer who is who. Anyways there was one big stretch in the middle of the film that was just amazingly boring, but thats ok, some parts of the movie were actually entertaining.

","The first Mission Impossible movie was a smart, interesting, well-crafted look into the IMF through the magic of the movie camera for the first time. It excelled where TV had failed - with edge-of-the-seat suspense, with special effects that only cinema can provide, and a plotline that would never have passed a TV network's damning gaze (It was NOT an impossible plot to follow - only innovatively twisted and required, originally, thought to understand.)<br/><br/>Of course, I was looking forward to the sequel, and I finally saw it yesterday. Wow, what an utter disaster of a movie that was crafted this time around. First of all, this has no sense of continuity to the first movie or the TV series - there is no Impossible Mission team, no smart Impossible Mission, really, and no sense of suspense that drew people to the Impossible Mission series in the first place. This is Broken Arrow II, if you like, but not IM. The promise of the first IM's last scene, when you realise that Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is going to be the head of his IMF team, is thrown out the window.<br/><br/>Instead, we've got an action-shmacktion here-is-the-plotline-laid-out-so-my-four-year-old-son-can-follow-it-look-out -Ethan! plot that ruins the movie (hence the suspense dies very quickly after the first grappling scene). We've got a case of Matrixitis, as if John Woo spent a few too many nights watching the Matrix after 12 hour shoots in the Australian desert and decided to have Ethan Hunt ""know kung-fu"". We've got ridiculous, over-the-top explosions and under-the-covers romantic undertones that seem forced and uninspired. We've got a female lead that starts out strong and spends the last hour and a half of the movie whimpering and annoying and weak (their depiction!)<br/><br/>How unfortunate this movie tried to be so much, when we would have been happy with the real Mission: Impossible II.

Maybe I am just being picky here but I believe that more could be done in this category.<br/><br/>Of course, with Tom Cruise in the lead role this movie is a guaranteed success.  I just hope that when the sequel comes out (and I am pretty sure there will be), it will have a more exciting plotline."

","There are so many things wrong with this film I don't know where to begin. But begin I will. John Woo is stuck in the 80's, when will people see this. When cars bump into each other they explode and somersault. The good guys are excellent marksmen but the baddies can't hit a thing. The good guys can take a bullet in the fuel tank and keep on truckin' but guess what ? the bad guys find their car exploding, etc. etc. etc. I won't list other ridiculous, cliched moments, but I'm sure you'll recognize most of them from the A-team. That's probably where the writers found the plot too. It's so insulting.<br/><br/>All of John Woo's films also turn into a single goodie against a single baddie, the rest of the cast turn into ornaments. Why bother have an MI team ? and the female lead .. ?!#$% I agree with jzgirl that she is reduced to a damsel in distress. You won't see a weaker criminal.<br/><br/>Given John Woo's Hollywood track record and being from Hong Kong I've seen plenty of his local films as well, I can't believe the fault lies at anyone else's feet but his. Luckily I like Tom Cruise but if I didn't I'd have given this film a 2 instead of a generous 4.<br/><br/>From an excellent first film, John Woo's pathetic 80's direction of a plotless script is a long, long way to fall."

","Mission Impossible II is an action movie for lovers of John Woo.  It has all the elements of a Woo film:  mirrored protagonist-antagonist, girl caught in the middle, even doves during action.  It also has an abundance of Woo-style action.  His famous slow-mos and superlative gunfire is all here.  It's a great ride for those who are looking strictly for action.  On the other hand, it has almost nothing to do with it's title.  The only Mission Impossible tradition which has been maintained is the disguises the hero (and villain) wears.  There is no ingenious sting, no avoidance and subterfuge - just in-your-face confrontation.<br/><br/>I'm not saying it was a bad film.  For action fans, it's probably the best Woo film yet.

","If John Woo released this as a regular movie, it would have been okay, but the fact that he tried to pass it off as being Mission: Impossible is almost insulting. What is definitely insulting is that instead of being one of those clever movies you have to see at least twice to see what you missed the first time, (i.e. Usual Suspects, Mission: Impossible 1), its a bland attempt at a James Bond flick. Speaking of Bond, the villain was ripped straight out of Goldeneye, and even looks like Sean Bean, (Actually he's named Sean too). The opening car chase sequence was taken right out of Goldfinger. None of the cleverness or stealthness and espionage from the first one is left in this movie. In fact all that is left from the original is the masks (which are grossly overused), a rip-off of the famous Black Vault scene (which also has Ethan gracefully stop short of smacking into the floor,) and the theme song which got sampled into a Limp Bizkit song. In other words, don't see it in theaters. Instead, wait until it comes out on video so you and your friends can have fun criticizing it to shreds in the comfort if your home."

","""Mission: Impossible 2"" is one of the few movies that has the oomph to live up to its hype.  John Woo has created a visual spectacle, and the story is just passable enough to maintain interest.<br/><br/>Plotline?  Fairly simple....Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is called back into service after a rogue agent steals the antidote to a lethal new manmade virus.  With the antidote the villain (Dougray Scott) can attain the virus and wreak havoc on the population.<br/><br/>I really want to praise John Woo, he has such a deft touch with action movies and the ones in this are no exception.  Fight scenes, chase scenes all so expertly choreographed that it seems like a ballet.  Top notch action sequences in this one that may only be rivaled this year by ""X-Men"".<br/><br/>Tom Cruise returns as Ethan Hunt,and is a engaging presence onscreen.  His chemistry with Thandie Newton (as Nyah, a very beautiful and clever thief) is top notch.  Wonderful characterization here, as Ethan never comes off too serious or too campy, but as a man trying to get the job done.<br/><br/>Thandie Newton plays Nyah Nordolf-Hall, a civilian thief recruited by the IMF to help Hunt get to the villian (more on him later) because of a past connection.  I havent seen any of Ms. Newton's earlier work, but may have to go back and see them.  She comes off as a classic elegant beauty, but her character gets little more than the ""love interest"" treatment.  She manages well though, and holds her own against Cruise.<br/><br/>Dougray Scott as the rogue IMF agent Sean Ambrose.  His deceptive and murderous ways have caused him to turn against those he used to defend and now he is in control of one of the most lethal viruses known to man.  And only he has the cure.  A very well played baddie by Scott, and he even steals a couple of scenes out from under Cruise.  First time I've seen him as well, but really cant wait to again.<br/><br/>Supporting cast is little more than window dressing, although Ving Rhames (Luther Stickell) is more interesting than the rest.  Cracks a couple pretty good jokes too.<br/><br/>""Mission: Impossible 2"" is everything the first should have been, action packed, entertaining, and enjoyable.  John Woo may very well have saved this franchise for Paramount, and should pass tips on how to properly make an action film to the next ""Mission"" director.<br/><br/>4 out of 5"

Like when Hunt was almost stabbed in the eye with that knife.  That was a great shot.  That's the kind of stuff that makes you sit up and say, ""Whoa!""  (The thing about the action was that they showed almost all the good stuff in the previews so you know what was going to happen.  You knew he was going to be hanging off the cliff, you knew that at some point in the movie the was going to be a motorcycle chase and they were going to jump at each other.  You see so much of the movie in the previews you aren't surprised anymore.)  But, anyway, I admit they left some holes in the plot such as how Ethan feel in love with Nyah so quickly, but that didn't make the movie entirely bad.<br/><br/>What you have to remember is that Mission: Impossible was good, you might even say great.  And MI:2 had a lot to live up to.  Maybe the movie itself wasn't so bad, but with people going into the theater thinking they are going to see something like the first, you are bound to have some disappointment.

","As with most overly hyped films of late, MI2 failed to live up to the lofty heights people (including myself) had built it up to. However, it was still a good action film, as one expects from anything that John Woo puts his name on. The final bike sequence, and the resulting fight between Cruise and Dougray Scott were both very good, but several sequences lacked the typical John Woo flair and originality that marked films like Face/Off and Hard Boiled. Still, it satisfied my desire for a decent action film. All of John Woo's trademarks were evident, from the slow motion photography (over used I thought) to the appearance of a dove (a trend started in Face/Off) to the odd religious reference, which were good to see, although a bit out of place at times.<br/><br/>The acting was decent, the characters were cast quite well (Thandie Newton is SUCH a babe!), but the major flaws were in plot and concepts. As with the first film, MI2 ignored the whole team philosophy of the TV series and concentrated almost entirely on Ethan Hunt, Cruise's character. The other two guys with Cruise were merely helping him along, they lacked any real cohesion or sense of working towards a common goal together. This was a disappointment, as was the threadbare obvious plot. A major highlight of the first one was that despite the lack of a team concept, you couldn't tell where it would go next. It did confuse a bit, and have one too many twists, but the unpredictability was good. Not so here, every last 'twist' I could pick immediately, as everyone I talked to also did. Yet another Hollywood film that pays little attention to script, plot, or screenplay and tries to cover these shortcomings with pyrotechnics and stunts. NEWSFLASH HOLLYWOOD: We are on to you!!<br/><br/>But for all its shortcomings, John Woo has provided a good ride, and a healthy dose of escapism, which we do need every now and then. 7 out of 10."

","In a significant departure from the television series, MI:2, rather than focusing on team tactics and specializations, instead make Cruise a one-man army.  Although he was directed to choose other team members, these members provided a minimal, negligible contribution and might as well have performed as taxi drivers.  All the 'important' and dramatic tasks fell to Cruise himself, while tasks a trained monkey could perform were given to everyone else.  Although the action sequences were frequent and Tom Cruise deserves kudos for performing many of the stunts himself, the movie was impossibly shallow and devoted purely to having him on center-screen for over two hours.  The only saving grace of the film was director John Wu's attempt to add a little artistic flair to the direction, but a painting made of dung is still dung."

","I recently travelled to the United States, whilst out there I was given the opportunity to visit the cinema. After much thought I decided to go and see MI:2, so that I could return to England full of info on one the summer's biggest movies to dazzle my mates with. Bad idea! MI:2 is the worst Tom Cruise film I have ever seen. The only thing impossible about this film was to actually enjoy it. O.k the stunts were well executed and the action was pretty non-stop, but that was all it was good for, It seemed to me that it was really an excuse for TC to get laid and look good in as many stunts as possible. The whole film had a really irritating undercurrent of a major love interest which hindered more than helped. The first half an hour was TC chasing a women (admittedly very beautiful) around and not really getting into the job at hand. This stopped the character from thinking straight which may be o.k in some people's books but to me took the whole meaning of Mission:impossible away. The rest of the film was taken up with TC in slow motion looking cool. MI:2 is a bad copy of a James Bond movie or even worst a double for anything by Steven Seagal. Soundtrack was disappointing also, the Adam Clayton/Larry Mullen version of the Lalo Schifrin classic was much better than this films heavy metal racket. I always thought better of Tom Cruise, his films have always been strong without the actual need for him to carry them. This one was produced by him and it showed a mile off (Shades of  Clint Eastwood) I wish now I had gone to see the opening 'Gone in 60 seconds' or  'Road trip' and waited for Mission Impossible to appear on the shelves at Blockbuster."

","I dare anyone out there to watch this film and count how many times director John Woo uses slow motion. About 20 minutes into the movie I was gripping my seat armrests in frustration, muttering under my breath, ""GET. ON. WITH. THE. SCENE!"" It is rare that I notice consciously any particular technique used by a filmaker, but in this case I felt like I was being smacked over the head with a scene from ""The Six Million Dollar Man"" over and over and over.<br/><br/>Unlike at least one reviewer, I was very impressed with the female lead and her character. Sure, she was predictable, but I did not see her so much as a damsel in distress as I saw her as a woman who knew when to play it cool and when to take action. Tom Cruise was, well, Tom Cruise.<br/><br/>
The plot? I read in an article a comment from Cruise that this movie concentrates more on Ethan Hawk's feelings and humanity than the convoluted (yet somehow entertaining because of its nearly unfathomable plot) MI: 1. Yes, it does do that. But it makes for a cliched, lurching plot, rather than an intriguing one. We are supposed to believe that Hawk, the consummate professional, falls in love with a woman because she drives almost as well as he does? Because she is a hottie? Because she has the nerve to be a thief? If Hawk did that, he would have been killed by some female spy or other by now. We needed something special, something unique, that pulled Hawk to the thief. But we never get it.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie depends on his feelings for her. And it is hard to tell whether his crush makes him a better or worse spy. But we go along as lots of things blow up real good.<br/><br/>I suppose in the end, what most bothered me about MI:2 was the boring plot. I expected more from a movie with the reputation of Mission Impossible. Instead, it seemed dumbed down in favor of style. I know, maybe Americans want that today. I guess I'm an exception.

","With all the hype about Mission: Impossible II and all the action and adventure, does anyone really remember that this was originally the most sophisticated spy-tv show around in the 1960's? Do they remember that it was about unfolding plots and secret espionage and real characters?<br/><br/>No, I think not.<br/><br/>Mission: Impossible II bares little resemblance to it's predecessor, which I found a guilty pleasure and intriguing, despite it's convoluted plot. This time around, John Woo takes over the reigns as director from Brian De Palma and turns it into a visual rollercoaster of action and stunts that will surely win over audiences (partly because they can't remember how good the original series was).<br/><br/>The story involves a deadly virus called Chymera (spelling?) that was accidentaly created by a pair of Russian scientists that work for Australian pharmaceutical giant Biocyte. To avoid spoilers, I must skip certain elements of the story. Anyway, an evil ex-IMF agent called Sean Ambrose is out to steal the virus and the antidote, thus infecting people with the devastating disease and forcing them to pay for the cure. Meanwhile, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is given the task of stopping Ambrose with the help of Sean's ex-flame, and Hunt's now-flame, Nyah Hall (Thandie Newton). She is to ""infiltrate"" Ambrose's scheme by restarting her relationship with him and feeding information to Hunt. Ethan also has the help of IMF agents Billy Baird (John Polson) and Luther Stickwell (Ving Rhames, reorising his role from Mission: Impossible). Soon, Hunt and his team are racing against the clock to stop Ambrose and to save Nyah, who is in great peril.<br/><br/>Now, its pretty useless that Cruise plays Ethan Hunt in this film: he resembles practically in no way the character from the first film. In Mission: Impossible, Hunt was a cold, edgy point man who was vaunerable but smart. He wasn't unstoppable, but he had guts and fury in his blood. In Mission: Impossible II, Hunt is basically James Bond: super slick, super cool, he immediatley gets the girl and has tons of explosive toys to use in dispatching Ambrose and his team. Not only that, but he has become a martial arts wizard who is basically a one man task force. When infiltrating a business deal with Ambrose and the Biocyte CEO, he goes through waves and waves of guards with acrobatic moves, hardly breaking a sweat. Hunt is an entertaining character but is nothing like the one we saw in the first film. Then why label this a sequel? Well, the first one made about $452 million and has a catchy theme song so why not take advantage?<br/><br/>This film also has a confusing plot, although not nearly as much as the first one. It involves a lot more of the brief ""masking"" that we saw in Mission: Impossible and it becomes very predictable and even rediculous. I won't spoil it, but in one scene where a mask change takes place, it is evident that Hunt would have had to brought a mask for himself and another character and a voice-changer for that character to an event in which he is not sure will happen or not! And the voice changers too! It is a little over-the-top rediculous that a microchip strip (like a piece of tape) across the vocal cords can manipulate your voice to that of anyone (like the voice-changer in Scream 3). If you remember the scene in Mission: Impossible where Hunt is disguised as Jim Phelps (Jon Voight, the bad guy), he does not say a word. How could he? He is still just Ethan Hunt wearing a mask!<br/><br/>Also, this sequel feels just like a vehicle for Cruise to look cool and blow things up nicely. Sure, with a huge star like Cruise almost any film with him is a vehicle but remember Mission: Impossible's fine supporting players?: Jon Voight, Emmanuelle Beart, Kristin Scott Thomas, Emilio Estevez (who actually works well), Vanessa Redgrave, Jean Reno and Ving Rhames (who had a much better role in the first one). I felt that Rhames was wasted as Stickwell, who offered very small comic relief and who's main purpose was to jump out of an exploding van, run all over Sydney searching for Nyah at Hunt's command or ""getting pissed"" because ""someone put a hole in my Versaci."" The cast in the sequel is good: Thandie Newton stands around looking either bravely defiant or innocent and scared, which she does very well, and Dougray Scott is a pleasant surprise as the nasty villan. Anthony Hopkins is perhaps the best as he takes over the job as Hunt's IMF chief.<br/><br/>But these multiple shortcomings are more than made up for woth the action. Oh, the action of John Woo. When Hunt executes his high-tech invasion of Biocyte, Woo turns the dogs loose in a blazing twin-barrelled fire fight that is absolutley thrilling. While I was kind of irked to see Cruise playing super cool through the rest of the movie, when the action came, I reveled in the magnificence. And how cool he is: kung-fuing his way through enemies, throwing grenades with ease and the end motorcycle chase. WOW. Hunt takes off on a motorcycle and two or three SUVs filled with Ambrose's nasties follow, along with Ambrose on a chopper of his own. The SUV drives across a small bridge, where it is met by Stickwell's gunfire. The SUV explodes and takes some of the bridge with it. And from the fire, we see Hunt, super cool, flying through the flames on the cycle. WOW.<br/><br/>So, expect something quite different from the original film and in my opinion, something not as satisfying. But if you are looking for something to hold you over until the next 007 film, this is the ticket. Most of the film barely works, if at all, but Woo puts on quite a show. This film puts him up there with today's best American action artists: Spielberg, McTiernan, Cameron and Donner."

","When word of this film and the people involved reached me about a year and a half ago, I was genuinely excited.  I enjoyed John Woo's Face Off and was one of the few who enjoyed the original Mission: Impossible.  I thought the ""it was confusing"" gripe about the original was bogus; people can comprehend plots, can't they??!!!<br/><br/>Well, MI:2 was average; nothing to rush out and see, but not horrible either.  I was very much reminded of James Bond throughout.  There are one-liners, a lover/aid, evil villain and his one main henchman, a good amount of cool gadgets, exotic locales; I could go on.  I have only seen bits and pieces of the original TV series, but it seems that this film pays very little homage to it.  I wonder if John Woo has ever seen Peter Graves and Leonard Nimoy in action.<br/><br/>The ""slowdown"" during several scenes (esp. the action ones) is a Woo trademark, but seems a bit overdone (and what is up with the bird obsession?).  I thought the classical music/choir voices music used during one scene was a bit over-dramatic.  The plot is nothing new.<br/><br/>And two ""light"" comments: is it me or was Hawke's hairdo in the first movie better suited to a secret agent than the long shag in MI:2?  And although I enjoy Limp Bizkit's version, where, oh where, is the ORIGINAL Lalo Schifrin MI music???"

","WARNING: SHORT SPOILER<br/><br/>This is one of the saddest sequels I've ever seen.  *Extremely* unbelievable.  The first M:I was more of a spy flick, where the plot was about coverups, conspiracy, etc.  This one was like an ignorant movie where they just shot each other and blew stuff up.  The part where Stickell almost died is stupid.  He opened the van door with 1 second left on the bomb and the explosion destroyed all the cars around it, and he only ended up w/ some torn clothing!  No new gadgets either, except for that ""voice-changer"" strip.  The best part was probably the part where Eathan desguised himself as the henchmen, and tricked Ambrose (the bad guy) into shooting his own henchmen.  Oh, and the cycle chase.  The ending of the chase was gay though. They were going head on at a ramming speed of about 120 MPH, slam into each other, and survive!  Then they fall off of a 30-foot cliff, after which neither is hurt!<br/><br/>Overall, 3 out of 10."

","I was worried as I headed into the theatre.  Last time I tackled one of these Mission: Impossible movies my comprehension of the plot turned into my own impossible mission.  I'm an eighteen year old girl, I don't get all this spy stuff.  Yeah, I'm pretty much there to see Tom Cruise.  I tried enjoying the last plot, but I was confused beyond ""duh.""  So, I sat down and decided to do my best with what I was given.  And surprise!  I got it!  Of course, understanding the plot does not mean that the movie had me at the edge of my seat.  In fact, the plot was rather tired by the time it reached me, seeing as how it had paraded through countless other movies and novels.  But!  I was still entertained for the two hours.  The stunts and music kept me happy, and I remained puzzled throughout the film wondering how a person could actually have such perfect skin (thank you Thandie).  So-- the idea is of an impossible mission.  I should think if a director or writer wished to show how the fabulous Ethan Hunt could carry out the impossible mission, he would try to make everything as realistic as possible to amaze the fans. However.  This one ranks up there with Star Trek in the realism department. Instead of glorifying the spy techniques of Ethan Hunt, it expounds upon Tom Cruise's Kung Fu fighting moves.  Who cares if he could really disguise himself as the bad guy in twenty seconds or less and get away with it?  He had makeup artists!  And a very imaginative writer.  Wait and rent this one, unless you wish to enjoy Tom or Thandie on the big screen.  Entertaining, but leaves one saying ""Yeah right."""

The chemistry between Tom Cruise and Thandie Newton is very good throughout the movie but it isn't until the John Woo action sequences until this film truly shines.

","Hi folks, Ok let's start with the Good: The rock-climbing scene at the beginning the movie is great and the music that accompanies this scene almost promises that this film might be something good.<br/><br/>The shots of Sydney are nice and they even managed to fit something other then the Sydney harbour bridge in. ;)<br/><br/>The bad: No we really don't sound like that ""mate"". The accent was soooo overdone -especially at the beginning of the movie, that you could see the Australian audience cringing in the cinema. Shame it was an Australian actor trying to sound like a really overdone Aussie, but I guess that's what the producers thought overseas audiences expected us to sound like. The only redeeming part about this was the fact that the South African accent of another character was even worse.<br/><br/>Why did Tom hide out in an outback sheep station? I mean that would be hours of flight time in a helicopter to Sydney. There would have been heaps of better places to hang out that would have had rivers and trees and all that green stuff. Whoops. Remember the clichéd Australia! If you don't live in Sydney, you must live on a sheep station. There are going to be a lot of confused tourists during the Olympics, when they find out we talk different and most have never been to a sheep station!<br/><br/>Hey maybe I shouldn't criticise the clichéd stuff as most countries, other then America seem to cop this, but Tom Cruise knows much better. With an Australian wife he spends a lot of time out here and knows how crap this stuff all is. It would have been nice if he had been a bit more honest in how he showed Australians and Australia.<br/><br/>The action scenes were slow and few coming, so I was glad when we got to the chase scenes. First we had mostly older cars (Australian built Ford Falcons) blow up all over the place - even on wooden bridges, with no damage to the bridge of course and then, having gotten rid of them we had the bikes. The bikes went on and on and on, basically going on until the stunt riders had run out of ideas about what else they could do. The problem was that disbelief was an early victim of this scene, having spun out and crashed long before the bikes had done the same. Hey this is an action film and fiction, so I am happy to suspend belief, but this sort of stuff just kept on coming until you couldn't help but think 'enough!'<br/><br/>Maybe all of this could be forgiven if it had a good story. Well it seems some people found the first movie (which did have a plot) to hard to handle - sore heads from thinking and all that. So they dumbed this movie down and then did it again just to be sure. We have so little plot that it could be written on a napkin. Just to make sure we get it this time though, the main points are gone over at least a couple of times in the movie. A good thing perhaps for Australian audiences as early on we are still getting over the Aussie accent.<br/><br/>Anyway if you are guessing I didn't enjoy this film, you would be right. It's been getting fair to poor reviews in Australia and frankly it deserves them. A big disappointment for a John Woo directed film.<br/><br/>My advice is to wait until it's on cable.<br/><br/>Regards, Daniel"

This film was far too simple to be considered in this respect.<br/><br/>The filmmakers do attempt to add some spice, filming in exotic locations with some rather well-done shot sequences, but there are some shots that are done poorly.  For example, typically when the director is going to order a straight-forward closeup of an actor's face, the intent is to draw the audience's attention in to set up an important scene.  Here, close-ups abound to serve only as eye candy or deliver dumb dialogue such as: ""Damn, you are beautiful"".<br/><br/>As I stated before, this movie was produced with no restraint on the budget, but as many big-budget films tend to be, this one is beautiful but shallow.<br/><br/>7 out of 10."

On the other hand, if you KNOW NOTHING about ""Mission: Impossible"" and are a generally dull, desensitized, short attention span, senseless violence type, you will certainly enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>For those of you who like M:I for what it was.  The plot in M:I2 is as thin as the air at the top of a mesa in New Mexico.  What's worse, to coddle to the unintelligent masses who complained that M:I1 was to hard to understand, the evolving details of the plot are explicitly spelled out every 10 minutes.  What's even worse, the dialog is recited at such a slow pace (so those with feeble minds may not miss the ""intricate"" details) that you'll no doubt get fed up with waiting for the characters to say what you'll KNOW is about to come out of their mouths.<br/><br/>And a note about the characters.  The director obviously favored the numb minded action sequences when he gave all of 5 minutes to character development.  The entire counter-plot, if you will, of the movie relies on character interplay which was developed for no more than 5 minutes (and during an action sequence, mind you).  In addition, the supposed super-spy IMF agents are as dull whited as the audience; a clear insult to the original M:I crew.<br/><br/>And as final disrespect to M:I (and maybe even to the chagrin of the action lovers), there is a pathetic lack of top-secret, superior, high-tech equipment.  M:I1's video wrist watches and cameras mounted in eye glasses are replaced with a consumer grade Kodak DC 265 with 32 meg flash card; $499.99 at your local electronics store.  And further more, the only high-tech special effect is used over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over (did I get all 6?).<br/><br/>Oh, and as a side note, this movie take explicit care to insult women in every way they can.  The crude sexual remarks are completely uncalled for.<br/><br/>Anyway, for all you action fans who don't have any interest in anything other than explosions and cheap American kung-fu, this movie is packed!

","I saw this movie a couple of weeks ago, I guess that M:I 2 was not designed to be a spy/action movie.  It turned out to be action to the core, I noticed a lot of people saying the special effects weren't anything the matrix hadn't accomplished, well, who really cares if the effects are a lot alike to the matrix, they work, that is the only way that some people can make it through the movie.  I was hoping for a little bit more intrigue, but was satisfied with a sexy leading lady :)  But for a Jewell thief, she becomes quite involved with ethics and morals.  It might have been better if She had figured out another way to get the last sample of virus away from the bad dude. Another thing that caught my attention was the long, overly drawn-out final fight scene. I do enjoy mindless violence, but how much can a person take, even in movie land, these guys jump off of speeding motorcycles, fall off a small cliff, smash each others face in, shoot at each other, slash each other, the scene is like ten minutes long, finally ends.<br/><br/>
Overall, It was not that bad, I wouldn't see it again, but am not gonna complain that it was a total waste, what you see is what you get, from the trailers you see action, action, and a hot chick, the movie is action, action, and a hot chick."

","I don't know which one is worse. ""The World is Not Enough"" or ""Mission Impossible 2"".

Directing: Woo is good with action movies. I should know, I've seen them. This wasn't his best. This had too much glamour and not enough darkness in the violence (trust me, the violence genres differ). Talking about glamour, what regular movie goer ever heard of John Woo before this movie?

Anybody who can truly appreciate the martial arts knows it requires grace -- Tom looks like a monkey; a romance that doesn't light anybody's fire; and stunts that not only defy explanation, flies in the face of common sense.

","So maybe the story was cliche and not too original. Maybe it wasn't Tom Cruise's most thoughprovoking film (but IMO it was a lot better than ""Eyes Wide Shut"") but ""Mission: Impossible 2"" was well worth my money. First in its defense, this movie falls under the action genre, which isn't known for it's deep philosophical dialouge or art house directing. You go to an action movie for the action and this movie had plenty. This movie was probably my most anticipated movie because it combined the talent of Tom Cruise and John Woo.<br/><br/>John Woo in his own right is a god among directors. He's totally changed the face of the action film in Hong Kong and now the US. Maybe his US films didn't have the world's best stories (i.e. ""Broken Arrow"" or ""Hard Target"") but they didn't fail in the action department. I think ""Face/Off"" had a better story but it lacked in the action area. His presence is even felt in the films that he just produced (""The Big Hit"" and ""The Replacement Killers""). I'll admit that the only truly entertaining parts of the movie was the final 1/3 of the film, but then again that's what I went to the movie for.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is one of Hollywood's most popular, talented, and underrated actors today. He's been nominate for the coveted Oscar three times and each time he's been snubbed. I'm just praying for the day he's work is appreciated with the time honored golden statue. I think this movie was a good move for Cruise in more ways than one. First, it shows that he has no problem making sequels like some actors do. Second, it proves that he's a multi-layered actor. He can work in a drama, comedy, love story, and now an action movie (and yes I know he proved that in the first ""Mission: Impossible). It's important to find an actor who has more than one role and Tom Cruise is one of those actors.<br/><br/>All in all I was entertained with the film. It wasn't a thought provoking drama but it was an action packed John Woo film, enough said."

","The first half of Mission Impossible 2 was somewhat promising--an elegant thief and a handsome hero work together to prevent an impending viral debacle.  The movie, however, quickly decomposed into a senseless series of big explosions and flying objects.<br/><br/>Woo is an exciting director, but the carelessness with which most of the action scenes were filmed/edited  was at first disappointing, and as the movie progressed, increasingly hilarious.  Bad guys fire  wildly into the air and then fall in seemingly-unrelated fits onto a spark-filled floor. There was even a point when I began to wonder if I should pretend that this was a movie about superheroes so that my overstimulated brain could make some sense of all the flying . . . .<br/><br/>
Tom Cruise is too good-natured  to be a shallow-minded action hero (I just wanted to pinch his cheeks), Thandie Newton was beautiful and enjoyable, and the bad guy (Scott) was good.

The plot in this movie was extremely thin and I felt at times like I was watching a model shoot or an advertisement for various products.

I am an Aussie, I live in the Capital city of Australia, Canberra four hours outside of Sydney and I thought it was well shown, I recognised many locales.  The saddest thing in the movie is when the poor Holden Statesman gets hit by the truck.  But the movie did lose its Mission Impossible status.  Just like Bond, Hunt falls in love with a girl that plays an crucial role, and just like the Matrix there are some good fight scenes and slow-mo shots.  But the movie was so predictable you really only need to see the first 30 minutes and then you can walk out knowing everything that happened.  The part that I liked best though, there was no bad guy telling good guy his whole plan.  Once he catches what he thinks is Hunt, he shoots him.  This movie is clearly for the action junkies, not for the mission impossible fan or a viewer that enjoys an unpredictable twisting plot."

This film is like an 'action movie valu-pack.' All the ingredients of your favorite action movie flavors all in one movie! For one low price!<br/><br/>Wouldn't it be nice if someone created a completely original character, rather than simply ripping off James Bond all the time?  Bond was a great idea forty years ago, when it was new. Example: Indiana Jones, an archaeologist searching for lost artifacts--one of the best movie characters anyone ever thought up. What we're basically offered here, though, is another spy movie about--and I still can't believe the blatant unoriginality--a madman who wants to unleash a killer virus. Tom Cruise's character, Ethan Hunt (a name almost as cool as 'Tom Cruise'), would like to stop him. Might as well call it ""Austin Powers 3."" After watching this dreck, I kind of missed the twisty, incomprehensible plot of 1997's ""Mission: Impossible."" Even if you couldn't understand what was going on half the time, at least it was interesting. At least the story held true to the spirit of the ""Mission: Impossible"" TV series and opened with a team mission. The excuse for Cruise being a loner for the rest of the movie is that most of his team members are killed in that opening sequence (sorry for the spoiler). In the sequel, Robert Towne and John Woo have no such excuse. They never even attempt to introduce a team concept.<br/><br/>Instead, we're given Tom Cruise. With long hair. Riding a motorcycle. Through fire. In slow motion. The film's creators go to great lengths to insure their star looks as cool as possible. I can't understand why Cruise wants to be Jean-Claude Van Damme all of a sudden. He doesn't even know martial arts, and yet here he is, jumping around, kicking people in the face. Who decided, I wonder, that two guys who can't fight beating the crap out of each other was fun to watch?<br/><br/>John Woo's goal, to break his own record for slow motion shots in a film, is achieved here (when a dove flies across the frame in slow motion as a stony-eyed Cruise walks toward us, I swear I wished it would crap on him). Had all of M:I 2's slow motion shots been done at normal speed, the film would've been a half hour long.

The story centers on a doomsday virus which Ambrose has stolen and threatens to let loose on the world.

Of course, Ethan and Nyah fall in love, making an oddly believable love triangle when she returns to her former lover and current nemesis.

A few flaws: the dumb stunt with the masks got tiring before long; Dougray Scott is not a very intense villain; and the ending takes to long.

","The series was a long way before my time, so when people got all cut about the way the first movie was too far from the series, I didn't pay too much attention, and I loved it. It was a good plot-boiler espionage thriller, with some satisfying action.<br/><br/>This movie however, is completely different, and the people who liked the first movie because of the plot probably won't be to pleased with this installment.<br/><br/>Basically, this is a movie about stunts.  There were so many stunts in it I can't even recall them all. Unfortunately for the director, a lot of the stunts just didn't work.  A few examples are the fight scenes, where Cruise would spin and flip all over the shop, when a simple kick in the head would have been sufficient. Or when Cruise launches a motorbike over a fence, and it somehow seems to travel just a little bit too far in the horizontal direction...  I also found it funny the way that when the bikes were riding on the road, they had full slick tire, and when they were on dirt or sand, a pit crew had somehow swapped the tires to racing knobbies without the camera ever catching it...<br/><br/>The plot wasn't really something I payed too much attention too, it was kinda basic and linear:  Some company makes an ""antivirus"" (?) for all influenza strains, but also creates a super-flu at the same time, planning to make a fortune when off the antivirus when the super-flu gets out. Then a renegade IMF agent steals the antivirus and basically extorts the company, while making plans to steal the super-flu at the same time.  Ethan Hunt and co. must destroy the super-flu blah blah blah....<br/><br/>The cast did allright with the little they had to work with.  Thandie Newton's character was a let-down:  she started the movie as a super-svelte thief and finished as a fragile scared little girl - quite a transformation. Ethan Hunt's IMF backup crew never had anything to do, they just flew around in a chopper and did nothing, the token Aussie character saying ""mate"" and ""bloke"" a few to many times for comfort.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is good as the all-action man, although he does look to be struggling in some of the fight scenes.  Don't get me wrong, he was very athletic, but when trying to do a lot of the kung fu moves he looked a little out of place, slow and cumbersome.<br/><br/>Lastly, I think I should say that whoever invented the slow-motion technique should be credited alongside the lead actors:  it felt like about half the movie was in slow motion.  It was done pretty well though, with a good score in the background so that viewers were getting the effect of it<br/><br/>If you love action and stunts and general mindless mayhem, go see it"

In the first film Ethan wasn't a super-hero but, for some reason in this film he is. Luther from the first film is back except he just sits behind a computer. Sean Ambrose is a great villan but is denied enough screen time to develop. The best point of this movie is the relationship between Anthony Hopkins and Tom Cruise. Their is a certain amount of not trusting each other one can feel, but once again it's under developed. The other thing that bothered me is that Ethan took no time to figure out the villan's plan contrary to the first film where it took him the whole movie to figure things out.<br/><br/>The good points of this movie is that as normal Tom Cruise is dead on in his performance as is Dougray Scott. The action is great but contrary to what most people are expecting this movie has only 2 big action moments (Both of which rock :).

","When you see a French Clown of Death dancing on the hood of a vintage renault, you're probably watching a Truffault film.  If you're watching death play chess with a knight errant for the latter's remaining hours, you're watching a Bergman.  When you see a terminal piece of crap oozing with delightful romantic misunderstandings, you know that Nora Ephron has made another film.  And when you see a white dove fly in slow motion through a wall of flame and gunfire, what can you be watching but a John Woo film.<br/><br/>In a very short period of time, Woo has become the most imitated director in the world.  Films as varied in quality from the Matrix to Killing Zoe employ scenes, characters, and stunts that have long been a staple of the growing Woo archetype.  Those in ""the know"" - that legion of geeky, parents' basement-dwelling, Dungeons & Dragons-playing, philospher-kings that own bootleg copies of The Killer in Cantonese - know that when some cracker hack with a steady cam makes an action film in the United States, it will inevitably contain a scene that they aped from a Woo classic.<br/><br/>With that in mind, it is an increasingly jarring experience when a new Woo film is released that is actually directed by John Woo.  One enters the theater with an air, rare anymore, of the penitent entering one of those stone cathedrals in which Woo loves so much to film.  It can only help, although only marginally, that in this, his fourth Hollywood production, there is nary a whiff of Travolta, Slater, or Van Damme.<br/><br/>Mission: Impossible 2 is the quintessential John Woo film.  It occupies a space beside Hardboiled, The Killer, A Better Tomorrow 1 & 2, Face/Off and Bullet in the Head as one of a continuing string of genre-defining action films. The story concerns Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt, top agent of the Impossible Mission Force, tracking down an international terrorist (Dougray Scott) who has stolen a priceless vaccine for an artificially created super-virus.  Along the way, Cruise falls for a stunning Thandie Newton playing a super-thief sporting a romantic history with Scott's baddie. The plot centers around the efforts of retrieving the vaccine while containing the virus.<br/><br/>If you don't get Woo - you probably won't get the film.  Without a healthy background in Woo-isms, a few things may strike the casual viewer as a bit odd.  With that in mind, I've included a small glossary.<br/><br/>the seemingly unmotivated slow-motion exposition - when an American director films something in slow motion, he does so to show an important prop that will be pivotal, no doubt, in future action.  When Woo does it, he's talking about that first glance that stretches, the moment when a villain and a cop discover that they are soul-brothers, that eternal instance in macho-lore where the gun and the hand speak the poetry of life and death. Huzzah!<br/><br/>the flying dove/pigeon - when a Western director films a pigeon or dove in flight, they're filming something in Venice or Paris.  When Woo films a dove in flight it is always in the seemingly unmotivated slow-motion exposition highlighting a pause in a ferocious firefight during which the duelists take stock of themselves, the positions that they are in in relation to life and to nature - the absurdity of the dance that they have not choreographed, but are helpless to complete.<br/><br/>the death of innocents - when a Western director films an innocent bystander getting shot during a firefight that does not involve them, they are filming a belligerent ethnic cabbie that deserved the bullet for getting off the boat in the first place.  When Woo films an innocent bystander flitting off to his final reward, he is asking the audience ""is this not our fate?  To laugh or be the laughed at?  To shoot or be the shot?""  In its essence, Woo posits Niezche's Ubermensch among the weak and the venal.  Asses are kicked.<br/><br/>the bizarre and stilted dialogue - When a Western director films bizarre and stilted dialogue, they have made the terrible and lamentable error of hiring Joe Esztherhaus - when Woo films bizarre and stilted dialogue he is saying ""I am filming Opera.  Spoken Opera sounds odd, does it not?""<br/><br/>the two-handed pistol-packing - When a Western director films his hero brandishing a gun in each hand, sliding across a floor, rolling and tumbling, and blasting away, he is stealing from John Woo.  Woo is the first director in modern cinema to understand that a gun is not only an extension of a man's penis, it must do things that a man wishes his penis could do. And there must be two of them.<br/><br/>the Bergman Persona shift - When a Western film has a hero that identifies with the villain, that hero is a brilliant FBI agent/investigative reporter/grizzled detective/behavioral psychiatrist that ""gets in the mind"" of the bad guy to track him down.  When John Woo has a hero that identifies with the bad guy - sometimes he actually becomes the bad guy (Face/Off). More importantly, the good guy always has a moment when they realize that they are actually behaving just like the bad guy but something, fate perhaps, has made them the good guy.  Also, in Woo, you not infrequently see the bad guy and the good guy cooperating in some capacity to foil, or at least delay, the eventual victory of one over the other.<br/><br/>There are hundreds of Wooisms - these are just the most consistent and prominent.  Know these Woo-isms and your understanding of the poetry of M:I 2 improves immeasurably.<br/><br/>I believe that it's important to take a moment here to comment on Tom Cruise's alarming lack of sexual chemistry with any of his romantic leads post Risky Business.  He has a vaguely weasel-reptile quality that makes his midgety good-looks more distracting than sexual.  Imagine a car-salesman faking an orgasm and you're halfway to imagining the extent of Cruise's lack of sexual charm (he can not be held responsible in Top Gun, however.  In Top Gun Kelly McGillis' noggin is so much larger than Cruise's dimunitive coconut that one is in eternal and mortal fear that she will actually consume him praying-mantis style - it is a problem that continues in the execrable Titanic in which the gigantic Kate Winslet looks as though, at any moment, she's going to wolf Leo down with a crumpet and a spot of tea). It doesn't hurt the film however, as any student of Woo knows that women are just the scarves that bind the hero and the villain in that eternal West Side Story scarf and knife fight.<br/><br/>Just as last fall's Galaxy Quest is the best new Star Trek film in decades, Mission: Impossible 2 is the best new James Bond film in decades.  Luckily for the free world, it's also the best new John Woo film since Hardboiled in 1987.  Know the zen - see it twice."

","I have already watched the Mission Impossible 2 in HK premiere last week. The film is surely satisfy the fan of both Tom Cruise and John Woo. (especially I am the fan of both guys)  I think that ppl should put down those thoughts about the original TV series or the M:I-1.  The idea of both Tom Cruise and John Woo is to make M:I-2 different.  Different to the First Movie and of course the original TV series.  They eventually did make the unique sequel for Mission Impossible.  But most of disappointment is the Australia Gov't banned their plan to shoot the car chasing scene in Sidney's Street.  This certain reduce the excitement and credit to the end of the film. However, the using of plastic mask is more brilliant than the M:I-1 (of course the advanced CG technology).  Some comment said the plot is predictable.  However, I did not see any movies which deliever the unpredictable plot.  Conversely, I think that the story in M:I-2 did have some unpredictable thing.  ie.  Thandie Newton shoot herself with the virus other than throw the virus gun to Ethan Hunt or more worse to give the virus gun to Dougray Scout.  Moreover, the actions in the ending is tremendously Jaw dropping.  I see some of foreign audience laugh to those actions.  But can they do that??? Even Tom Cruise is required the special training for this.  I think that the action scene in M:I-2 is surely overwhelm those called action scene.  For example,  in THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH, the latest James Bond film, I would say I can leave the theatre after I saw the opening boat chase.  (even that is no more better than the boat chase in FACE OFF or can I say ""copy cat from FACE OFF???).  In GRADIATOR, the scene of Tiger and Russo Crowe, the fast photography cause me vomit just like watching the Bair Witch Project.  By the way, can I suggest a question - as far as I know, the Roman Empire did not ever expand to China or America, then why they will have Tiger????  As far as I know, only Lion could be found in Roman.  If they did have Tiger, then why they put those rare animals to fight with Gradiator?????.  I agree with Tom Cruise said ""No one can copy John Woo's film"".  John Woo is definitely an unique action director.  For me, I would graded this film to B+.  If they have a finished script before shooting, the film will be much higher graded than it right now.  Certainly I would enjoy to see it for second time when it released on 22/6/2000 (for HK).  And of course, I will buy the DVD version.  But I hope Paramount will deliver us more supplements like Commentary from John Woo and Tom Cruise and the Making of M:I-2 and behind the scene."

","Hey, like anyone else, I knew what I was getting into when I got tickets for this video game of a movie (and it's $9.50 in NY, so you gotta be a devoted moviegoer here) ... although I was certainly entertained, still, I must say that I was not entirely capivated. Tom tosses his hair back with the frequency of a drunk sorority girl. The rubber mask routine was entirely predictable after the first time. The slo-mo action got a little tired after a while, and Thandie Newton's character, which started out promisingly spunky, degenerated into a boring doe-eyed martyr. The plot is minimal, and even my generous willingness to disbelieve was challenged frequently by the outrageous violations of physical law. M:I2 owes quite a bit to the overblown Matrix school of camerawork (I loved 'The Matrix' but fear we are in for years of mediocre imitations). <br/><br/>Still, it's a good matinee flick even at these inflated prices; the special effects are good, there are lots big exciting explosions and loud crashing noises, and Tom Cruise has grown into his face at long last. Plus, his hair looks damn good.<br/><br/>As long as you aren't expecting anything profound, it's a decent Saturday afternoon popcorn-cruncher of a flick.

The fight scenes we also terribly long, there were also parts I knew for sure were supposed to be serious, dramatic, thought-provoking scenes but they came off as super funny. I also hated the over use of the masks, after a while I wanted to put one on myself and become deaf so I wouldn't have to hear the crap-tacular dialogue. There's also a scene that looks remarkably like the same as the first-Cruise suspended by a rope, stops just an inch and a half above a highly sensitive floor *woooohooo, it was boring*. There were some seriously good parts of the movie like, Dougray Scott's Ambrose, he was the best villain I've seen in a long time *and HOT too:)*, the slow-motion stuff was cool for a while and so was the car chase in the beginning, also excellent was the choice of location-Sydney, Australia ... it made for some nice scenic shots.

Not that I expect an action movie to have a lot of substance, but John Woo sacrificed plot and believability for as many explosions, fight scenes and car chases as I have ever seen in one film. I felt insulted as an audience member that I was expected to believe that the two main characters were in love within 30 seconds (of film time) of meeting one another, that someone could escape a bomb within 2 seconds of it going off without a scratch, and that after colliding mid-air with someone at a combined speed of about 200 km/hr and falling 40 feet off a cliff, Tom Cruise could walk away unscathed.

","It was with great expectations I went to see MI2. Why? Because the first movie was a great disappointment and I really thought the new one would be something extraordinary. And it sure is.<br/><br/>After a somewhat confusing start, the plot takes form, and it is quite easy to predict the story. But hey! We are talking about an action movie here. One that claims to be a Mission Impossible, and I have to agree with that. Most of the tricks and stunts are really impossible, but that is what makes the movie worth seeing. If you are looking for a great story, with logic and reality you should see something else. MI-2 is pure action all the way through, with a small touch of romance as is appropriate in a good action flick. A bit confusing sometimes, you don't always know if the guy you see on the screen really is who you think it is.<br/><br/>The answer to my question is that it may not be the best action movie ever made (it has to compete with Face Off, The Rock and other masterpieces), but it is pretty close. Tom Cruise is not a very good action actor, but I think his effort in this movie is acceptable. What makes me give this flick a rather embarrassing 6, is a few flaws that could easily be avoided. Hey.. there is no way a SUV will out run an accelerating motor cycle. I don't care if the stunts are impossible in reality, as long as it fits in the story, but please!!<br/><br/>Conclusion: If you like action flicks with cool special effects but don't care much about reality or the story line, this is a movie for you. It is entertaining to say the least!"

","Not much to add to all the other comments, except that ""The Matrix"" appears to have dictated to action movie directors that people fighting each other in a scene need to execute flips/spins in excess of 720 degrees, in slow motion, before ever landing a punch or kick.  Are these fights or outtakes from the X-Games?<br/><br/>I supposed the technique is de rigueur in the Kung Fu genre, and it was pretty funny in ""Big Trouble in Little China,"" but I hope this particular trend is otherwise short lived.

It did look good and the wardrobe was nice but the acting was terrible, dialogue weak, and the pace was too slow too bear. I've heard from other viewers that the last fifteen minutes of the movie were amazing, but the rest of the movie doesn't grab you. The only highlight is Anthony Hopkins who in six minutes, gives the best acting performance in the movie. My wife and I   both decided to walk out. Maybe we should have stayed, but I really couldn't see it getting better.

I mean, what is Mission Impossible (or any action movie) without a few moments where the story takes a sudden turn that you weren't expecting.  The constant slow motion, techno-drenched, swirly camera shots were ludicrous once you realized that most of the action was practically impossible or not nearly as exciting as Woo wanted you to think it was.  Woo's deal is that he tries to amaze you with his camera work in an attempt to divert your attention from the paper thin plot and characters.  And seriously, that gun just happened to be buried at his feet in the sand?  How creative.  To sum up, Mission Impossible 2 is a brainless pseudo-action movie which plods along in a series of slow motion shots and shallow love scenes before exploding into a horribly unrealistic  case study in idiocy."

The final fight sequence was especially tedious.<br/><br/>Switching directors from movie to movie in a franchise is not usually a good sign: the Alien movies are patchy, the Batman movies have spiralled into oblivion (I hope).

","Against my better knowledge I went and saw Mission: Impossible 2 shortly after it premiered, armed with what turned out to be a suitably a cautious mindset. I didn't really like the original Mission: Impossible (not that these two have anything whatsoever in common, apart from Cruise and the title music) though I do respect that it was a stylish and expertly crafted film. John Woo's sequel is unfortunately not. Yes, it does have a checklist of action clichÃ©s (explosions, bikes, guns, cleavage, etc), but the delivery is just so frustratingly plain. <br/><br/>The plot revolves around Cruise and Co finding a vial of deadly virus, though the plot is far from the strongest point in the film. My big complaint was that M:I-2 just didn't come together well. It shuddered and jolted through predictable set pieces. Visually each piece was shot well, though there was no linking continuity. Sydney looked nice (think Water Rats + multimillion dollar budget), though perhaps The Matrix portrayed it better. <br/><br/>There were a few nice touches: the scene inside the research building in particular with the glass and neon lighting. However, every good point is countered by several bad ones, such as the tragically masculine 'courting' car chase, the slightly heavy-handed white dove symbolism, the final showdown between Cruise and the archetypal South African villain that dragged on and on, and so on. <br/><br/>In conclusion, I found M:I-2 a predictably bad action, virtually devoid of inspired filmmaking. Please don't go see this one, it's already raked in enough profit. Try Gladiators if you're in the mood for some epic action.<br/><br/>Two Stars (from 5).

A lot of hard work has left Tom a lean, mean, fighting machine, and it shows with stunts and martial arts that we've never seen him perform before. The movie far exceeds its predecessor on the 'impossible' stakes and it is worth seeing for the final motor cycle chase alone. Thandie Newton is quite the sex kitten, and the only real complaint is that they didn't use Ving Rhames's considerable talent enough. Nevertheless, MI:2 is the best action flick you'll see all year: short on storyline, long on action - impossible to miss.<br/><br/>Note: it also continues the long-standing tradition of when a movie is set in Australia, the Sydney Opera House must be shown as many times as possible.

Although the special effects are an improvement on the first movie, this is the first time I have been in danger of falling asleep during a John Woo film.

","CONTAINS SPOILERS!<br/><br/>This movie started promisingly, but went downhill after the first second of footage.  After a poor imitation of ""Cliffhanger"" which we'd all seen on the trailer a thousand times already, we transport everyone to Sydney, Sydney, Sydney, Sydney, Sydney, Australia.<br/><br/>Did I mention Sydney enough?  Because we're in Sydney, Australia, as evidenced by every shot containing the Sydney Opera House, the Sydney Harbour Bridge, Sydney this, Sydney that.  The people organising the 2000 Olympic Games must have been sleeping with the director, since the whole thing is just one giant tourism advertisement for Sydney.<br/><br/>Not only is the action all happening in Sydney, but there's a nice helicopter flight to some outback HQ of the agents.  For no explainable reason, except to show the Outback.  Thousands of expected tourists this year for the Olympic Games, and a major movie just happens to show the tourism sights of Sydney, and a handy shot of an Aussie corrugated iron hut near a sheep shed in the Outback.<br/><br/>It is here that things really go downhill with a real Australian actor putting on one of the worst Aussie accents since Meryl Streep moaned ""a dungos gut muh baybee"" in the film 'Evil Angels'.  Apparently we all get about calling one another 'mate' and 'sport' four times per sentence. Hey, it's a stereotype - quick!  Exploit it!  We're all yokel Aussies down here, mate!  Come visit us!  We say 'sport' and 'mate' a lot!  I was stunned to see no use of the word 'cobber'.<br/><br/>One of the other exciting things about Australia is the way our soil affects visitors.  The female eye-candy role in this film is supposedly from the other side of the world, speaks with a lilting accent, and yet drops in the word 'blokes' when talking to Tom Cruise at the racetrack.<br/><br/>Don't even get me started on the physics behind a motorcycle being rapidly caught by a heavy 4WD vehicle.  Anyone heard of the ""power to weight ratio""? Certainly not the people making this film...  Oh, and of course, we Aussies like to store our dangerous stuff in metal cylinders branded with ""hazardous waste"" and keep them in bunkers that have large openings to the environment. Oh, and if pigeons want to fly into our secret lairs, that's fine too. ""No worries mate"" as any Aussie or wanna-be-Aussie in MI2 would happily screech.<br/><br/>To be fair to the terrible attempts at Australian accents, the other accents were equally shocking.  The ""baddies"" kept wavering between German and South African accents, all through the film.<br/><br/>All in all, a dismal waste of time, money and film.  I am sure it will go through the roof because it has Tom Cruise and explosions, but still, you've got to worry about a movie when the entire Australian audience cringes aloud in the cinema as an Australian with a bad Australian accent appears on screen.  Or when they all break out in laughter at a time when they shouldn't be - in the middle of an ""exciting"" chase scene and a motorbike is outpaced by something it couldn't be.<br/><br/>The only Mission Impossible here was to keep a straight face at the laughably poor acting, the ludicrous use of Australian icons just to remind you it is set in Australia (did I mention Sydney, Sydney, Sydney yet?), and the overall dismissal of any physics laws for the entire filming of the movie.<br/><br/>Yes, it is supposed to be a bit of fun, and I like movies that suspend reality for a while, but this was a shocker.  I went there to watch the film and relax my mind, not to feed it utter manure..."

To really pull off truly incredible stunts a movie needs to have the fantasy elements of a film like 'The Matrix' in order to suspend the disbelief of the viewer.<br/><br/>2. The hero of the plot needs to possess the roguish charm of a character like Pierce Brosnan's James Bond to attract the ladies at the drop of a hat.

John Woo should have talked his star in to taking some real risks with the character, other than the treacherous mountain shots, which, although real, we are informed, looked positively corny. (The audience was having a real good belly laugh, anyway).<br/><br/>The plot was very thin, so thin that it looked merely like a vehicle on which to hang all the super action shots. Thus creating a tremendous sense of imbalance throughout the entire movie.<br/><br/>Best bits - Even though they raise a few giggles - the Action scenes are very good, amazingly choreographed. John Woo fans will not be disappointed. The cinematography was excellent. The Spanish flamenco scene was one of the best in terms of beauty and visual tension.<br/><br/>Ving Rhames and John Polson as the trusty sidekicks were great, and gave the film some much needed character. Thandie Newman was perfect and played her part well.<br/><br/>Now, just before I go point number 3. For all US film companies, writers and directors.

","Mission Impossible is a very good movie, and is very well done. The movie opens with the villain in disguise as Ethan Hunt, (Tom Cruise), where they hijack a plane and steal a man's briefcase with a top secret virus in it. Then you see Ethan Hunt on a 2,000 foot cliff, and he makes it to the top, without a stunt double (entertainment weekly). In comparison to the first one, the sequel was much better. The beginning is a love story, and it is a lot like something out of a Hitchcock flick. The plot is as follows: Ethan Hunt must steal a deadly German virus from the villain, Sean Ambrose. They also create an cure for the virus, and they plan to corner the hospitals/market and force them to pay them millions of dollars for the cure. The action is great, and the plot is fairly easy to follow, unlike the first one. a very good ending, too. There was one problem, and that is the fact that the movie went a little heavy on masks and disguises, and occasionally, it was too predictable. Other than that, John Woo has created a great flick.

But we are just to assume that repeated watchings of the matrix will turn you into Jet Li I guess. Finally, given that this is a john woo movie, I was let down on how little action there actually was. I may buy the dvd, but only for the last 15 minutes.

","Most of the reviews gives the movie such high praise and it is at the top of the box office list right now, but I must say that I am surprise that most everyone finds it to be so good.  The reason I say this is because I did see it also, I did enjoy it and the special effects were cool, but it seemed to be a move where thirty percent of it was put together from ideas created in other movies.   Case in point.  In the opening scene where Ethan Hunt is on vacation and IMF has to track him down to send him on another mission.  They find him rock climbing.  The special effects for the scene were very good and only someone with a death wish would have made the leap the character (Mr. Hunt) did in that scene, but guess what.  Paramount Pictures did the same opening scene in a movie called Star Trek V: The Final Frontier, where Captain Kirk was on vacation and the Enterprise tracked him down to send him on another mission.  They found the Captain rock climbing in Yellow Stone National Park.  This movie, Star Trek V came out in 1989.  So I expected MI2 (2000) to give me something different from what I saw 11 years ago.  There are many other stolen scenes as well in MI2 but I won't talk about them because I want to leave something for others to talk about.<br/><br/>    The plot from the bad guy point of view does hit the mark when you apply the same theory to today's reality.  Although I don't think many of the previous reviews have picked up on that fact yet or maybe someone left it for me to talk about.  The idea is this, a new deadly virus has just been created, so lets steal it and the antidote, introduce the virus to the public and sale the antidote to a pharmaceutical company for fifty or sixty million dollars and let them resale it back to the public.  In other words people will pay through the noise for legal drugs that will give them a cure, and in today's world with AIDS and Herpies they are paying out of the other end for a promise of a cure.  Do you think this idea is just a coincidence or maybe that some things that happen in real life are carried over into movies?<br/><br/>    There and three leading roles in the movie and they all do an excellent job under the direction of John Woo.

I had to wonder how Nyah Hall(Thandie Newton) could get from downtown Sydney to those cliffs so quickly. And this brings up something else, really Cruise is only fighting to save one person, so if she does get infected it'll just be her who dies. Though we're supposed to care for this character, it's just not that evil of a plan when only one person dies. Also according the laws of action movies the girl can't die, so you know she's not going to bite the chimera. I also have to wonder how Cruise can punch somebody once in the head and they're knocked out but he can punch and kick Dougray Scott and even smash his head into a pointy rock, and what's this? Scott is conscious. I don't mind Woo's constant firing and no reloading, but this just got plain ridiculous. Also with the face masks, how obvious was that? It also seems strange that Dougray Scott who is a couple of inches taller than Cruise can play Cruise so well.

That's too bad, because the action, frankly, isn't so compelling. A lot of it is so overdone as to be laughable. And there's a limit to how much of this stuff you can watch in one sitting without getting a headache, anyway.<br/><br/>And, just to make things worse, the spectacle and noise of the huge explosions, the car chases, and the gun battles is exactly the kind of thing you have to see in the theater to enjoy at all. This flick will have even less to offer on video.<br/><br/>4/10"

","MI2 is a very enjoyable film.  It had a lot of good action sequences, some suspense, surprises to throw viewers for a loop, and great special effects. Unfortunately, it lacks a lot of depth and mystery that the first installment has.

","I saw this film with great expectation. John Woo is known for excellent action sequences and there were some of these, but why did they all have to be in slow motion? It is not as action packed if everything is slowed down. Also it could have been an hour and a half if everything was at normal speed.  It looked like he had seen The Matrix too many times.<br/><br/>As for the story, it was a very simple plot and you always knew who the bad guy was, even when he was wearing a mask. I really enjoyed the twists in the first one. The use of the flashback was exceptional there. Other camera angles you didn't catch were made clear later. In this one, I could have gone to sleep for an hour and woken up at the end to have entire sequences replayed for me in flashback. I truly think this movie was made on the 3rd grade level so that no one would miss anything or have any excuse to see it again (bad for business). It was all an excuse for Tom Cruise to show off (the stunts he did were pretty impressive). More Luther is needed in the next sequel, which I am sure there will be. Hopefully they put a little more thought into the script."
"Steven Reynolds","5","0","0","2 June 2000"," ""You've gotta be kidding.""
","This distressingly inept no-brainer is not only a bad sequel - it's a bad film in its own right.  The essential problem is a mismatch of talents. Robert Towne is a wonderful writer, and this ""Notorious"" knock-off might have worked in a different franchise, but as a ""Mission: Impossible"" scenario it's too dated, too simple and too slow.  Similarly, John Woo is master of a certain kind of action, and he shines momentarily in the few opportunities the script gives him, but for the rest of the time he's struggling.  The result is a film that's plain boring.  Ugly and boring. Hans Zimmer's rhythmic score is about the only thing to keep you interested. But even that fails in the tragic/romantic moments when Zimmer shamelessly rips-off his own work from ""Gladiator"" and thereby suddenly makes you realize how emotionally disengaging this film is by comparison.  For Australian audiences, ""M:I-2"" offers some particularly exquisite tortures: a great actor like Richard Roxburgh murdering a South-African (?) accent; well-known Sydney locations trying to pass for Seville; and the mind-boggling casting of John Polson which, in retrospect, is probably quite appropriate - the finished film has the amateurish look and feel of a mediocre entry for 'Tropfest'.  It gives us nothing we haven't seen before and considerably less than we deserve.  Doing a better job wouldn't have been impossible.  Not even difficult.  It just would've required better judgement."

","Frankly, this movie disappointed me.  I thoroughly enjoyed the first installment of the series, which was as interesting as it was entertaining. However, Mission:Impossible 2 little resembles its predecessor.  Ever since I heard that John Woo was to direct M:I-2, I was crestfallen and miffed; as an action director, I thought he had little place to direct a sort of movie where action is not really the main theme.  I was correct.  John Woo's style of slow-motion action simply did not fit with a Mission:Impossible movie. Simple action may not have disappointed me so, but some of the action scenes are downright absurd.  One in particular would have broken many bones in both the characters' bodies.  And I found it rather odd that when the movie called for Tom Cruise's character to shoot someone, the script called for his having to do some sort of flip beforehand.  As unfitting as the action may be, the movie did, however, contain some of the intrigue and maneuvering that the first did, but not very much.  It is as if Woo made an action film and simply added a bit of the Mission:Impossible trademark in order to call it a Mission:Impossible film.

","Okay ... let me start out by saying that I love John Woo films.  A Better Tomorrow, The Killer, Hard Boiled, Face/Off, were great films.  In my opinion, he is the penultimate action movie director.<br/><br/>Now, let me get into MI2.  Except for the action sequences, I thought it was a horrible Hi-I'm-Tom-Cruise-watch-me-in-an-action-movie vehicle. Everything in this movie is everything that is NOT Mission Impossible. The original Mission Impossible TV show was suspense-based and most of the time after you watched an episode, you had to think about what just happened. The original MI team also didn't intentionally go head to head with danger, rather they used misdirection and camouflage to get away.  The first MI movie kept most of this premise.<br/><br/>But not this movie.  The plot in this movie was weak.  The location was all wrong as well.  I like Australia, but I just don't see it as a location for international intrigue and terrorism.  There was no real MI team; Ving Rhames and the other guy seem to have been added in the movie just to make it look like a team.  Dougray Scott is a good actor, but not good for the role cause he's too much of a pretty boy to take seriously as a villain. They should have used a villainous looking actor like Robert Davi or Sean Bean.  John Woo was wasted on this movie in my opinion, because of the lack of a plot, uninteresting characters, and horrible dialogue are too heavy a burden for the action scenes to hold up.  If Tom Cruise wants to make an American James Bond style movie, he should buy the rights to A Man Called Flint and remake that instead.<br/><br/>So if you love John Woo style action, go see this movie.  If you have schoolgirl's crush on Tom Cruise, go see this movie.  If you want to watch a good summer blockbuster movie, go see Gladiator.  I'm just glad I paid matinee price to watch this movie.

Second, even though this is a John Woo film, its the worst Woo film I've ever seen.  The action sequences are well choreographed but the story is so stupid that Woo's graceful touches are just corny.

","WARNING: SPOILERS<br/><br/>Quite possibly one of the dumbest action movies I've ever seen, this Mission: Impossible bears absolutely no resemblance to the far superior original by the far superior director, Brian DePalma.  The action in M:I2? Stupid.  The suspense in M:12?  Nowhere to be found.  The ""romance"" in M:I2? Hahahaha...Tom Cruise and Thandie Newton have about as much chemistry as oil and water.  I'd rather watch paint dry than have to suffer through this movie again.<br/><br/>The over-simplified plot of this Mission is a definite departure from the intricacies of the first film, but it's a turn for the worse. While the villain's rationale is somewhat amusing, his character is about the least-threatening big-screen bad guy I've ever seen.  Also, John Woo seems to be in the business of ripping himself off.  This time around we're subjected to the same old boring operatic violence, birds, and slo-mo action sequences as in Face/Off.  But far more troubling are the DePalma references which smack of a severe lack of creativity on the director's part.  I swear, several shots were culled directly from the original (see the part where Ambrose almost sticks Hunt in the eye with his knife, or the whole sequence where Hunt repels into the high-rise vent system).  Dumb, dumb, dumb.<br/><br/>This is a very bad movie and I strongly advise against seeing it.  Ever. But what I still don't understand is this: why in the hell would Ethan Hunt ever carry around a mask of himself?  If you've seen the movie you know what I mean, and I defy you to make any sense of it.  Unfortunately, this is exactly the sort of weak foundation that the entire movie is built upon. Tom Cruise: slumming.  John Woo: Overrated (way overrated).  Anthony Hopkins and Ving Rhames: under-used. Thandie Newton: hot, but not much else. Mission: Retarded!!!"

","I saw MI:2 with a buddy Friday night, and we both LOVED it! I've read some mediocre reviews, but for my money, this was one of the best-filmed action movies of all time. The dialog was often silly, and the plot was infantile (though, no more so than a typical James Bond film), but the action scenes and camera work were pure poetry.<br/><br/>John Woo makes extensive use of his trademark melodramatic, slow-motion ballets of violence. We've seen these moves before, but they've never looked better than here. Even when he depicts Spanish Flamenco dancers, we don't really see much of their faces, but their shoes thunder into the wooden floorboards with violence and passion, while their dresses billow and whirl in a crimson haze through smoky, golden light. It's all beautiful and dreamlike. And speaking of beauty, no Bond girl has ever looked as exotically, achingly, mouth-wateringly beautiful as Thandie Newton does in this film.<br/><br/>And that incredible motorcycle chase!!! My god! Much more involving than the interminable Boat Chase scene in Face-Off; this time, Woo gives us a hero who can fire a gun with deadly accuracy, while spinning round-and-round in a scary, out-of-control, cliffside skid-out on the rear wheel of a bad-ass Triumph motorcycle. None of it was believable for a second, but I was on the edge of my seat with my mouth open the whole time. MI:2 was the Bond movie no one's managed to make up 'til now, and you MUST see it on the big screen; this is not a renter!<br/><br/>Fortunately, I rode my own motorcycle to the movie, so I got to play Tom Cruise on the way home, weaving in and out of traffic with the M:I theme music playing in my head.

Tom Cruise's smoothness and remarkable compusure are qualities that I wish dominated my personality.  The abilities of the characters to use super computers and computer chips to constantly monitor people seems too far-fetched, but in the Mission Impossible movies it strikes me as too cool.  When I criticize movies, I tend to argue that they are too implausible or their characters achieve feats that in all likelihood would have not happened realistically.  However, when I see a film like Mission Impossible 2, I put aside these criticisms because the ambience of the movie encourages these ""impossible"" scenes and characters, and makes them entertaining to watch.  From every bullet that miraculously misses Cruise to the satellite which monitors the whereabouts of the villains, I just enjoy the whole fantasy of the film.  Of course, any fantastical movie is hindered if its plot is too ridiculous or unbelievable, but the intricate storyline of Mission Impossible 2 interested me almost as much as the incredible fight scenes and car chases.  The plot of this impossible movie is much better and more cleverly crafted then the plots of most movies that try to project a more realistic atmosphere than Mission Impossible 2.

But none the less I paid the $7 and checked it out.<br/><br/>First of all this movie is NOT like M:I1, sure we've got Tom Cruise running around with a bunch of cool gadgets but the similarities end there. What we don't have is the intriguing and complicated plot of the first movie, in fact I thought the plot was fairly bland and uninteresting. We also don't have the shocking plot twists, yes there are attempts at plot twists but they're all way too predictable to be even the least bit shocking. It felt to me like Woo just tried to palm off all the twists with a bunch of mask scenes (you know the ones where you think it's one person but it turns out to be someone else), I thought the first one was good but I found it very easy to guess all the rest.<br/><br/>However, most of the action scenes, although extremely unrealistic, were exciting and well done. You can really see John Woo come out in the action, particularly the last scene. There are tons of big, cool explosions, gunfights, stand offs, and slow motion effects. By far his flashiest, but not his best movie. A downside to M:I2 was that it had to be rated PG-13, most all of Woo's other films have R ratings which adds a level of brutality to them, and in that, realism. I found it took away from the movie to have such obviously far fetched scenes in it. I mean come on, you expect us to believe that two men can collide in mid air at a good 60 miles an hour, fall off a 20 foot ledge and then proceed to get in a ruthless fist fight? In reality they would be extremely lucky to be alive, and I mean EXTREMELY LUCKY!!! But who really cares, it's not like action movies are about realism, and by no means am I saying that Woo's other movies are realistic, but they were certainly more realistic than this one.<br/><br/>So what did I think of this movie overall? Well, it's not bad. I didn't leave the theater feeling completely ripped off like with Battlefield Earth. However I also didn't leave the theater already wanting to see it again like with Gladiator. All in all it was a pretty average action flick, nothing really special like M:I1.

","Contains spoilers.<br/><br/>Like so many movies of the past few years, Mission 2 seemed like a movie in search of itself.  It felt like it was trying to be many things that is just quite couldn't.  And more important to the detriment of the film, I kept saying things to myself during the film.  Things like, ""The fight scenes were good, but they were better in The Matrix,""  ""The choreography of the action scenes was OK, but they were more intense in Face/Off,""  or ""The gadgets were neat, but they were cooler in James Bond.""  One more thing I couldn't get out of my head - and don't take this the wrong way - was ""How did they get Tom Cruise's hair to be all silky and wavy when he flips around like that?""  Actually, I think Cruise got paid $25 million, and his hair must've got another $5 million at least, for all the acting it did.  The movie was enjoyable, don't get me wrong, but it lacked the *escapist* element.  The female lead, Thandie Newton, was terrific in her role as the thief turned spy.  And she almost had more emotion as Tom's Hair.  Um, that's supposed to be a compliment.  But it brings up another problem.  All the other actors seemed a bit under used.  Ving Rhames, at the time of the first movie, was on the verge of becoming a major African American film star.  What with his great performances in Pulp Fiction, Dave, and Out of Sight, you'd think he'd have a bigger role this time around.  But if anything, it was less memorable than the Hair.  (I'm sorry, that's really the biggest thing I remember about the movie now, 5 hours after seeing it.) And where did the other member of the IMF team come from, and what was his purpose?  My point being simply that the characters were very under used. Oh!  There's another thing.  The bad guy.  No, I didn't have a particular problem with Dougray Scott, he was supposed to look like Cruise.  But his henchman rubbed me the wrong way.  Mr. Stamp (a bit too close to Tomorrow Never Dies' Mr. Stamper) couldn't decide whether he was an intelligent killer, or a bad-a** thug.  I would have preferred the former, and liked to have seen Thomas Jane from Deep Blue Sea in that role.  He makes a really good brooding bad guy.  Another major part of the ""under used"" list was Anthony Hopkins.  He made a passable IMF leader, but he didn't look like he was enjoying himself very much.<br/><br/>Ok, it was worth seeing, definitely.  I just think it should have concentrated more on the action than the romance, or the other way around.<br/><br/>One last note. As a would-be filmmaker, I had to notice the over-use of the suddenly very popular slo-mo shot.  It was just short of annoying.  Let's hope for a return to more traditional film styles, instead of the ""so-different-it's-cool"" motif we're seeing so much of lately.  It's not that I don't like new and exciting, but not when it's used just because it's new and different."

","That's right! Cruise as Face, Hopkins as Hannibal Lec... umm , King, and Rhames as B.A. Barracus (""I need work!""). There was a fourth guy, i'm sure. That's so sad that I remember that.<br/><br/>How can this movie be so cool and disappointing at the same time? Let me break it down for you kittens. John Woo fans (I count myself as one) should not be anything but thrilled by this movie. But here's the catch-- it's also a Mission: Impossible movie, and the two don't mix quite as well as you might think.<br/><br/>I loved the first M:I film. Have no idea if it followed the TV show faithfully, nor do I care. DePalma and Cruise kick so much booty in that one. This is why I have problems with the sequel. This stuff has been eating away at me since seeing the movie, so it's good to get it off my chest. When, between the two films, did Ethan Hunt become James Bond? I wouldn't have blinked if Newton's name in the film was Youwanna Humpme. I was so bored by the relationship between Cruise and Newton in the film. When did they fall in love? I must have missed that part, I only remember the shagging. I didn't care for the new, self confident Ethan Hunt. I enjoyed his awkward moments in the first movie.<br/><br/>Other things that didn't sit well with me-- when did Ethan learn to fight? Didn't old man Voight take him down with one punch in the first film? He's gotta be, what? 60? Since when does Luthor (Rhames) know anything except computers? I remember him hiding in the bathroom from the Swedish-looking guy in the first film, this one he's blowing up cars with a grenade launcher from a helicopter. Are these the same characters? Don't get me started on the Aussie...<br/><br/>Dougray Scott is dull as the bad guy. A Bond villain, really. Everything about this movie smells like James Bond, I swear, I wonder if they had this 007 script lying around and decided to switch the names around. He pokes fun at Cruise and that big stupid grin of his. Yeah, what about that smile? A little of smiling Tommy boy never hurt a movie. Cruise is so serious in this film. I like Tom. Smile more, buddy!<br/><br/>The action scenes were magnificent, except.... and I hate myself for thinking this, but.... I started wondering, ""What is the point of this, besides the fact that it looks cool?"". And I hate myself! I never question Woo's over the top action scenes, I just sit back and enjoy. Why did I question it this time? Because it's Mission: Impossible, and I don't know where the Mission: Impossible part came in. The first movie, you could break it down into three main scenes-- the embassy party mission, the CIA in Langley mission, and the train mission. This one has lots of shooting and kicking. I love shooting and kicking! But not in M:I. This movie really needs more brains.<br/><br/>I had heard rumors that there was some conflict between Cruise the producer and Woo on set. This originally outraged me. How dare the big pretty boy star throw his weight around with one of my favorite directors? After seeing this i'm wondering, ""Maybe Cruise gave him too much room to play with"". The action sequences (especaily the last act) would have made more sense if the whole movie was a virtual reality game Ethan was playing. If he Wachowski's don't have the time to direct the Matrix sequel, Woo could do wonderful things with that movie, I think.<br/><br/>Gotta wrap this up, did I write all this? If you're a Woo fan, you should love this movie. It probably tops all his other films for stunt work and action sequences. I expect his next movie will be even bigger. If you're a Mission: Impossible fan, you might be very disappointed. If you're a fan of both, then you are like me- stuck somewhere in the middle. 6/10 stars. G'night!"

","I suppose I won't win any popularity points for saying this, but I actually enjoyed Brian DePalma's concept for the first MI film. The technobabble was present, but not pressing with lots of fun gadgetry and the suspense and intrigue one might associate with a film about espionage. Unfortunately, John Woo flushes all those elements in the first twenty minutes of his Mission Impossible concept. Instead of gadgets, we have everyone running around in latex masks pretending to be someone else, and theatergoers (many of whom didn't look particularly shiny) audibly guessing at the obvious ""plot-twists"" that the writers of this fetid pile of filmmaking would have us believe passes for intrigue. All I saw was tired, uninspired dialogue with poorly executed timing on the parts of actors who should know better (well, maybe not Dougray Scott - he's not too shiny either). It became very obvious that Paramount spent so much of the film's budget letting John Woo blow sh*t up that they didn't have enough money to hire a decent script doctor. The first half hour, I was wondering when Cruise was going to stop romancing the love interest and start getting on with the mission. In short, a giant waste of time IMHO, but don't take my word for it. One recommendation though, you might rent Armageddon before going to see MI:2 - oh, you remember that one from two summers ago that everyone was carrying on about how lame the story was and how it was an insult to the collective intellect of the masses: yeah, MI:2 makes that look like the Godfather by comparison. Seeing is believing, but I would wait to see MI:2 on video. (4 out of 10 stars)"

","In terms of action, this movie will definitely keep you on the edge of your seat, but it had a high ""cringe"" factor. When I think of ""Mission Impossible"" I don't think ""love story"" and that's exactly what this movie is. I just couldn't bring myself to believe that Ethan Hunt would actually get hooked on a woman after spending one night with her. Ethan is too smart to fall for that and I was extremely disappointed by his bad judgment.<br/><br/>The action scenes are well shot, the pace of the film is excellent, and the storyline is interesting. I love Tom Cruise as an actor (and as a male physical specimen) and he did a great job of playing Mr. Joe-Cool-Secret-Agent-Guy. But that's the problem...he's too cool to fall for a professional thief like Naya. I just didn't buy it. Speaking of Naya...she impressed me in the beginning of the film, but after the first half-hour her two or three limited facial expressions got a bit old. Keep in mind that most of the action sequences are so unbelievable you might just laugh out loud. But I guess that's the point???? Also, I got a bit sick of all the mask-rip-offs -- I could see them coming a mile away. Anthony Hopkins should have had a slightly bigger role because he's a brilliant actor and didn't have much of a part to work with.<br/><br/>MI2 is worth seeing, but I my opinion the first one was MUCH better."

The reason for this is that the producers apparently didn't find it necessary to even include a plot. No plot, but a lot of action sequences, explosions, chases, stunts, and even some unnecessary coversation. Mostly because of this the movie is extremely shallow and contrived, but rarely boring.<br/><br/>	Much of the acting is pretty standard. Thandie Newton, who I've heard is excellent in 1998's 'Beloved', is nothing more than another pretty face here. Cruise is no match for Pierce Brosnan, and Dougray Scott is lacking any of the charisma required for an effective villain. Anthony Hopkins makes the most out of his limited screen time, and is likely the most interesting character to watch in the entire 140 minute movie.<br/><br/>	Most of the action sequences are good, except for the climactic fight scene, which is way too long, and ends up getting repetitive after a few minutes. John Woo brings his trademark Hong Kong edge to the movie, which is both a good thing and a bad thing. In my opinion, leave these movies to directors like Andrew Davis, and give Woo the Jackie Chan type martial arts movies.<br/><br/>	Watch it if you're a fan of the original, but if you are a die hard Bond fan, don't jump ship, and stay with your superior MGM series.

","Boy, what a disappointment. I expected so much more from a potential blockbuster. The plot concept for the mission is good. But the movie breaks down from there. The movie was directed by John Woo. Director of ""Face/Off"", John Travolta and Nicholas Cage. ""Hard Target"", Van Damme, ""Broken Arrow"", Travolta and Christian Slater. This movie was so bad that I considered walking out and waiting for my friends in the lobby. A lot of the sentiment is way to action movie cliche. There is no real intrigue that you would expect from a deep cover spy movie. There is about five minutes of character development, and those five minutes were laughable. In fact, the whole movie theater did laugh. In fact, there was a lot of laughing during the movie. The rest of the movie was a heavy visual effect movie. Not like Star Wars visual effects, rather just a lot of ""eye candy"". It was a lot of unbelievable stunts, car chases and martial arts fighting. From that respect it had a bit of a ""Matrix"" feel to it. But even The Matrix had better plot and character development. Don't go see this movie and expect to see anything like that last one. Some of the characters are the same. Tom Cruise is Ethan Hunt and Ving Rhames returns as Luther Stickle. But this movie is all about Ethan Hunt. Rhames' character is very minor, and is nothing more than a snapshot of the Luther that we first met in the train car in the first movie, not the man he had become by the end. He's all attitude and one liners. Anthony Hopkins, who plays Hunt's boss is only in the movie very briefly, and even he is nothing but attitude. I guess that's how I would sum up this movie: attitude and fighting. But that's it. The characters in the movie are two dimensional puppets that Woo uses to show some cool fight scenes.

","First, let's get one thing on the table: I think the first ""Mission:Impossible"" was superbly crafted by Brian De Palma, who used his balletic camera style to heighten suspense and beautifully frame several stunning set pieces. The plot, unfairly maligned by many with limited attention spans, was intriguing, with surprising twists. I think it was one of the best films of its type.<br/><br/>""M:I 2,"" on the other hand, is a dull, plodding affair with little suspense. Everything seems recycled and unoriginal -- a bit of ""Notorious,"" a bit of ""To Catch a Thief,"" a bit of James Bond, all mixed in a base of Hong Kong kung fu movies. There is nothing you haven't seen before (and done better). It depresses me that some actually prefer this ""dumbed down"" version of ""Mission:Impossible"" to the much-superior first movie in the series.<br/><br/>The camera work is cliched, with John Woo repeating himself (in slow motion, of course). The script, what there is of it, is quite poor, and Woo (who did much better work in ""Face/Off"") gets performances from his actors to match. Cruise is Cruise, and the rest of actors are either ill-used or turn in hammy performances. Anthony Hopkins tries what he can with his few minutes of screen time, but unfortunately it's all made up of worthless speeches with no interaction to speak of. He's essentially a variation of M in the Bond series and little more.<br/><br/>Although I've never had any problem suspending disbelief at the movies, this one goes too far in having us check our brains at the door. The face mask trick is overdone and entirely unconvincing as used here. The bike chase at the end, which seems to be getting the most praise, is hard to enjoy because it is so wildly unrealistic and not much more than a series of stunts strung together.<br/><br/>All in all, I can only hope that this is a low point in the ""Mission:Impossible"" series and that the franchise will return to the level established by the first movie in the next one."

All of the elements could be cleared from the checklist of things required in a blockbuster movie of this nature, but somehow, they didn't fit together right.<br/><br/>Character development was there but hollow - I didn't really buy-in to the Cruise/Newton love connection, no matter how many times they shared slo-mo looks across a crowded room.<br/><br/>They tried hard to make me believe there was a love-at-first-sight love affair between Cruise & Newton.

","Who would have ever thought that pairing up Tom Cruise with John Woo would have ended up in a let down?  Mr. Cruise has proven time and again (see RAIN MAN, MAGNOLIA, BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY) that if given the right material to work with, he is one of the best actors working today.  Mr. Woo has proven time and again that he is a master of the action film (see HARD BOILED and THE KILLERS).  So what happened here?  My guess is that the script by Robert Towne is simply not good, and so even if one brings in John Woo there is only so much he can do.  To be sure, there are some very impressive sequences in this film, but you just don't care.  You don't care about Thandie Newton's character, and you certainly don't care about Ethan Hunt."

The fighting and the explosions and the killing were great, but let's remember who made the film: John Woo (Broken Arrow, ew). Never before had I heard Tom Cruise yell ""Hiyahhh!"" when he kicked somebody's ass. Some very unbelievable moments dampened this movie. I've never felt more patronized and belittled while watching a movie as I was during the ""left inner pocket"" sequence. You'll know what I mean if you've seen the movie. Not to mention that our hero falls in love with our heroine after one night of raunchy sex (oh please). John Woo is a great stunt coordinator/choreographer, but a crappy film maker.

The story is rubbish, nasty virii movies have been done already - it's totally Tom vs the baddies, this is in no way a team of people outfoxing the bad guys as in the original series. Sure there are a couple of players around, Ving Rhames is the computer guy, and then someone it seems they picked up off the street cos he was australian and could fly a helicopter, but they basically just sit around watching Tom do the work. The only active team member (the lovely to look at but annoyingly English accented Thandie), who is supposed to be a world-class thief and ""I don't take sh*t from anybody"" person, and she starts out that way, is reduced to ""oh god help me I'm only a female and I love you Tom please rescue me""."

","Okay, I didn't mind the first M:I, but it was hampered by a ridiculous script and the always ham-handed directing of Mr. DePalma. When I heard the man, the myth, the legend, John Woo, was directing the sequel, I got very excited. Perhaps too excited. I felt that after the brilliant Face/Off Woo would be allowed to finally let his true style loose. Well, I got what I wanted. A little too much of what I wanted. This whole film felt like a parody of a John Woo film, taking every stylistic aspect and blowing it WAY out of proportion. However, it was beautiful to look at. The script in the first film was filled with wild plot twists which were given no leadup whatsoever, simply justified afterwards. In my opinion, a good twist is something that leaves you slapping your forehead and berating yourself for how stupid you were for not figuring out beforehand. M:I-2 give you leadup alright. Again, I got what I wanted, but too much. The ""twists"" were inanely predictable, offering no challenge for the audience. In one instance I guessed the ""twist"" a full half-hour before it took place. Before the lead up even took place. For me, the script left me feeling just as hollow as the first one did, only the technique was different. I really have been harping on this film rather harshly- it had some very good points. The acting was terrific pretty much all around, the cinematography was simply stunning, and the action was, of course, truly amazing. But it never gripped me. It never sucked me in the way great thrillers like Fargo, The Usual Suspects or pretty much any Hitchcock film have. I never felt any of the characters were in any danger, and worse, I just didn't care. See it, but leave it for a matinee or the dollar theatre. They don't need your money anyway."

In the end though, the last 25 minutes of this movie does so much that not even The Matrix can top.

Tom Cruise seemed to be saying ""See I still have what it takes to be an action star"".  Not to mention the entire movie was so completely predictable I could have left 30 minutes into it and not felt as if I missed anything at all.  They over did the rubber mask scenario, the bad guy didn't make you hate him.  He didn't generate any feelings in me what so ever.  And that female lead (I don't even care to know her name) has zero acting ability at all.  The only look she knows how to give is the pouty, someone come save me look.  The love interest story line should have been more downplayed in my opinion and they should have picked a better vilian, or broadened his role to make him more believable and sinister.

John Woo's slow motion direction style made a slow movie even slower. Someone should inform him that once you use the same special effect twice or more to provide a twist to the movie you shouldn't continue to use it over and over. If people couldn't see what was coming in this one well before it happened then they must have been asleep. One other tip for Mr. Woo, from watching his fight sequences I believe he must play Tekken 3 too much. If anybody has ever played the game you'll know what I mean. I'm sure Dougray Scott is kicking himself for passing on the role of Wolverine in the upcoming X-Men movie for the role of such an easily forgotten villain.

There will not be a better nail-biter than the highwire segment in the first.<br/><br/>When I saw that John Woo was going to direct #2, I was psyched! I had visions of Faceoff dancing through my head, eager to see two hours of hard-core, non-stop action. Here's where you should take heed. The action scenes are few and far between and most of the stuff they do seems like deja vu from dozens of older films. The first Mission, cited as ""too complicated"", made the writers come up with a cliche and grade school simple storyline of an agent gone bad [how many times have we seen this?]whose only schtick is a Scottish accent, who plans on wiping out the world with a virus.<br/><br/>It took a good hour before any real action hit the screen, and most of it was like a rehash of Faceoff. Anthony Hopkins was HORRENDOUSLY under-used, and Ving Rhames, who is a terrific actor, gets stuck sitting in a van the whole film, mashing away on a keyboard.<br/><br/>The implausability factor is from Cruise though. In the first film, he was a clean-cut, by the book agent with a nice mix of daredevil and intelligence. In this one, he is a mix of Shaggy from Scooby-Doo and some horrible Van Damme wanna-be. Part of what made this film ridiculous was Cruise suddenly bouncing around like a kung-fu master!? The one scene where I laughed out loud was the start of the bike chase. After dispatching a bunch of guys, he runs over to a bike and then STOPS AND PUTS ON HIS SUNGLASSES!?!? How STUPID is that!?<br/><br/>All in all, if you want to see this film, watch the trailer.

","What was this movie? It wasn't Mission: Impossible. It was kind of like a very poor attempt at James Bond, with a little more kung fu thrown in for good measure. The only problem was, apart from the action sequences -- and I will confess that John Woo directs some very inspired fighting sequences -- this film had no point. Why was it made? Why did Tom Cruise allow this script to be filmed? And why did he buy into the very popular misconception that John Woo knows anything at all about directing a coherent film in the English language? Let's look at this closely, shall we?<br/><br/>Mission: Impossible belongs to the spy-thriller/espionage genre. If you take a look at the previous film or the television series, I think you will find them easy to classify. This...well, this was some kind of weird hybrid, save the world, over the top action, explosion, car chase extravaganza. I don't know how to classify this. All I know is that this wasn't a spy movie. It had nothing at all to do with espionage.<br/><br/>But perhaps more than anything, however, the success of the Mission: Impossible franchise relies upon the interaction of the ensemble casts. Sure, Cruise was the obvious star of the original film, but he would have been nothing without great support from the likes of Ving Rhames, Jean Reno, and Emmanuelle BÃ©art, all of whom played integral roles. Who the hell did he have in this movie? Okay. Ving Rhames is back, but why? He was a piece of furniture, placed in the film to make a joke here and there about wardrobe or sheep dung. That Australian guy? Who was he? I don't even know his name, that's how unimportant he was. Anthony Hopkins? Why was he in this movie? And how much did they pay him for his 3 minutes of screen time? Thandie Newton was actually quite good in M:I-2, but like all the characters, she wasn't a person. Just somebody for Cruise to react to. The relationship between them was entirely unconvincing, and more than once, she simply served the function of a catalyst for some sort of future action which would, undoubtedly, make no sense.<br/><br/>Woo wanted to give Mission: Impossible a heart? Then why are all of the characterisations so poorly done? The villain is just a raving lunatic and everybody knows it. John Voight's disgruntled and unappreciated civil servant mentality from the first one made more sense. Why in hell did IMF use Ambrose to double for Ethan Hunt? They had to know he was unstable. Cruise is super-man. He can do anything. No longer is he the smug spy that he was in the original film. He's Jet Lee. He's Chow Yun Phat. He's anyone but Ethan Hunt. Woo never really even attempts to establish a believable character or limits for this character. The whole rock climbing scene? What does this say about Ethan Hunt? Please. Don't get me started.<br/><br/>And the whole thief with a heart of gold thing has been done better about a million times. I have no reason to believe Nyah would fall in love with Hunt, and Woo doesn't seem to care that he never bothered to explain how that happened.<br/><br/>The plot? Whatever. This movie had no plot. The only attempt anybody made at recapturing the espionage feel of the series, was the obvious rip-off of the Langley scene from the first film. In M:I-2, Langley happened to be Biocyte or whatever it was called) headquarters, but the scene completely fell flat. The suspense so deftly created by DePalma in Mission: Impossible is nowhere to be found, as Woo seems to just let his effects do the talking.<br/><br/>Not a horrible movie, but a tremendous let-down. Don't go into this film expecting Mission: Impossible. Go into it expecting a mediocre action film that really accomplishes nothing and basically serves no purpose in ever having been made."

","I went into this film with somewhat low expectations, but hey, it's John Woo, I would probably go to a sequal to a movie based on a Saturday Night Live sketch if he was the director.  It was kind of what I was afraid a neutered PG-13 John Woo movie would be like.  Face/Off gave me hope that a good compromise could be reached between mainstream Hollywood action filmmaking, and John Woo's peculiar brand of ""heroic bloodshed"" cinema.  You can occasionally see a little bit of the John Woo we know and love trying to get out, but mainly this is a showcase for Tom Cruise's ego.  You get the feeling that the producers were keeping Woo on a short leash.  There were sequences in the movie where I thought to myself ""I know this is supposed to be an exciting sequence, but I'm just not excited"".  Good actors like Anthony Hopkins and Ving Rhames are given fairly useless roles where they have nothing to do.  Robert Townes' cheesy script makes me think Chinatown being good was due more to Roman Polanski than him.  A far cry from Woo's classic HK films like A Better Tomorrow I&II, The Killer, A Bullet in the Head, and Hard-Boiled."

","What a terrific way to kill a franchise. Take everything that worked from the first film and replace it with slow motion shots of Tom Cruise doing back flips.<br/><br/>This is less a film than it is a monument to the amazing egos of John Woo and Tom Cruise. The brilliant break-in of the computer lab at Langley in the first film was included as a homage to the great heist film ""Topkapi."" Every scene in this film, however, was included as a homage to itself.<br/><br/>Get this: This evil Australian pharmaceutical company invents a killer super virus and its antidote, so they can unleash the former and sell the latter at an exorbitant price. But here's the catch: the virus kills the infected after 20 hours...which doesn't really leave too many people around to pay for the cure, does it? Hell, you come up with a bad cough and you'll be waiting in the doctor's office for half of that amount of time.<br/><br/>Or did I miss something form the ""plot,"" which is entirely possible because the entire thing was told so poorly and with such confusion that I'm surprised I managed to follow any of it at all. Who the villain was, for example, or what were his motives was never explained even in the slightest. He was a rogue IMF agent, I guess...but didn't that happen in the last film too? What is it about the IMF team that makes its agents go not just crazy, but completely, absolutely psycho-Hitler style crazy? You'd think they'd hire a psychiatrist to give these people psycho-evaluations or something.<br/><br/>But it is illogical plot devices such as this that fuel bad action films, and that is just what this film is. It's really unforgivable, really, considering the supreme talent that was involved.<br/><br/>But, Donald, you might be thinking, what do an intelligent plot and engaging characters have to do with a kick ass action movie? If the action is there (and, for the most part, it is. The action sequences in this film are really top drawer) then the film is a success, right? Wrong, not when the film in question comes from a pedigree such as this, where an intelligent plot and engaging characters are the norm and should be a given. The first movie and the original series deserve better than this. Tom Cruise proved himself to be a great producer with the first MI, hiring DePalma and some great actors to create as witty, exciting, and suspenseful a spy thriller as Hollywood has ever scene. But in this film he hired an over the top director with little to no experience with the genre and some great actors, sure, but with absolutely nothing to do.<br/><br/>You might question why Anthony Hopkins was hired to act in this movie for only about three minutes. Allow me to tell you why: Because only an actor of his caliber could deliver lines like, ""This isn't Mission Difficult, this is Mission Impossible. Difficult should be a walk in the park,"" and *not* have audience members jumping from their seats, out to their cars where they'll either go to Blockbuster to rent the first film or straight home to catch an episode of the original series on TV Land.<br/><br/>This movie sucked, pure and simple, and had as little to do with the first film or the original series as I am to Hercules. Gone was the brilliant interplay between the ensemble cast. Hell, gone was the brilliant ensemble cast. Emilio Estevez had more screen time than the third member of Ethan's team (that australian guy) had in this one."

","Bruce Geller is turning over in his grave. The newest film installment of the Mission Impossible series is not deserving of the title. It is a mindless action movie, completely void of all that made Mission Impossible, both the first movie and the TV series, a superior movie and TV experience. John Woo has proved once again to be a very mildly talented director with only one thing in mind: how many bullets he can throw into a crappy movie. Rather than give people something new, Woo and Cruise have brought you a farce of an action movie. Granted, some of the action sequences are exciting at times, but I firmly believe that Mission Impossible should be about the story, and not about how many people Tom Cruise can kill. I recognize that I am looking at this from a perspective of what it should have been, and not what it is. It should have, could have been a much better movie.

The other characters are credible if not well developed but this isn't too much of a problem because the plot is central around two characters: Ethan Hunt and Naya, the thief he ensnares to help him to recapture the chimera.

","I was waiting for months to see this movie.  I thought the combination of Woo, Cruise and Thandie Newton, would make this movie bigger and better than the first and a great movie.  Well, the movie is a better than the 1st Mission Impossible but that isn't saying too much.  Woo and Cruise ruin an opportunity (and big budget) to make a great action/spy film.  Instead, Woo goes for a few chase scenes and one really interesting gun fight.<br/><br/>Where to begin with this - I think I knew we were in trouble with the opening scene.  Not to give anything away, but let's just say it is an airborne scene I have seen 1 million times in a spy/action thriller.  No new twists no new turns... very surprising.  Then you cut to the Cruise cliffhanging mountain scene which you see ad nauseum in the previews.  It is a nice opening montage, but you are left saying, ""what was the point to that?""<br/><br/>We then are introduced to Thandie Newton who is SUPER HOT.  But whoever wrote this thing and Woo, do nothing with this character at all.  She is introduced as a super thief, but she never puts these talents to use.  It is nice to see Cruise has a love interest, but it is the year 2000 and the woman should be more than window dressing.  She should have been more involved in the mission... unfortunately she is just a James Bond like woman.  Now this wouldn't be bad but she is hardly in the last part of the movie, and she is not sexy or anything so what was her point.<br/><br/>My next problem with this movie is the idea of Mission Impossible AND Ving Rames.  For some reason except for the 1st montage of the 1st MI and a few minutes of the second MI, Mission Impossible has failed miserably to live up to the formula that made the TV show so excellent.  Mission Impossible should be about a team of spies who work together to accomplish a mission. There should be deception intrigue... These 2 movies have just been about Tom Cruise and no teamwork.  Which leads to Ving.  Ving is awesome yet he is not truly allowed to take part in any of the missions.  What a waste of talent!! Ving Rhames has to be given more screen time. <br/><br/>
Next up - the villain.  I'm not giving anything away by saying that the villain in this is a rogue IMF agent.  But you never get a sense of how bad he is or why he has turned evil (unless I slept through this part).  Since the writers have decided to dumb down the Mission Impossible franchise, the bad guy becomes even more important and the audience must really hate him. But I never felt that hatred for him nor did I think he was ruthless or even funny. He was just kinda there.<br/><br/>Gadgets- Hey this is Mission Impossible, there should be some cool gadgets, but unfortunately no one in the prop department could think of anything hi tech or cool.  What a waste.  No special weapon or gun or vehicle.  Just those dumb rubber masks that are used to tie up loose plot twists.<br/><br/>1 Gun Battle - There is only 1 real gun battle in this movie.  Was this done to pacify the gun control lobby.  Woo thrives on action and gun play yet there was far too little in this picture... it almost seemed like a Batman comic book.<br/><br/>So there are my thoughts.  It is an okay diversion but then you realize there have been far better spy/action films (give me any of the last James Bond picts) and that Woo did so much better with Face/Off.  Then you hear that the movie made close to $100 million already so it doesn't really matter.  But hopefully Mission Impossible 3 will finally bring the franchise a good plot to go along with the Woo-like effects and gimmicks.  This movie made me want to go see Shanghai Noon which I hear doesn't disappoint the true action fan."

The characters are hideous- one wonders how much Anthony Hopkins needed a pay day to show up in this one. OK, fine so the plot is swiss cheese and the characters stink is a good action film? No. The movie opens with the use of the all concealing rubber masks/voice changers and continues to overuse them as a plot device. These masks, BTW, have the incredible ability to make folks taller/shorter, thinner/fatter and come pre-scorched so they are just right for any scene. The device is not only hackneyed but obvious in every use. The martial arts sequences are again boring. Woo loves the spectacular but the fight scenes seem more designed to show off Tom Cruise's whipping hair than any martial arts skills (which I doubt Cruise of the villian-actor had much of). The motorcycle chase scenes are dull but include: an obvious computer animation gaff where the cycle hovers during a jump, a silly wire trick for a front wheelie and Tom's cycle becoming bulletproof while he hides behind it?!?! There are, by my guess, 2 action sequences (one which includes the trademark Woo two gun action)and the finale plus one short and pointless car chase in a movie that runs around 2 hours. The rest is a lot of talking by characters you'll struggle to care a whit about. Skip it."

You can tell that Woo, Tom Cruise and the stuntmen worked hard to give the audience five great action sequences.  The motorcycle scene at the end was spectacular. Yet, all of the action scenes are linked to a very poorly executed love story and another killer virus plot.<br/><br/>Cruise's Ethan Hunt falls in love with team member/thief Nyah (Thandie Newton), but not one person in the theater could believe that these two people had fallen madly in love with each other after just meeting 24 hours ago. This is crucial because the movie revolves around their relationship. The plot about the killer virus is simple, but it would have worked if the love story was stronger. Woo needed to make the love story more believable and he failed. Hey, if we were all able to look across the room at someone and fall madly in love, then maybe we could believe this so-called ""love story.""<br/><br/>Thandie Newton's performance was horrible; she looked dazed and confused at the camera half the time and I wasn't sold that she was this tough, international thief either. Dougray Scott was a formidable and evil villain. He gave a very good performance. Having Anthony Hopkins in the movie, though he is a great actor,  was a waste of time and money. Don't go to see this movie just to see him. Actor Czerny Henry, who played IMF boss Eugene Kittridge in the first film, should have returned to play Hopkins' part and perhaps the filmmakers could have saved some money and hired a better lead actress.<br/><br/>The movie had the Woo effect: a slow-paced, moody feeling broken by fast-paced action sequences and special effects.  Cruise's portrayal of Ethan Hunt was different in this sequel than the original. In the first film, Hunt was confident in his abilities but was scared of what was lurking behind the corner. In this film, Woo and Cruise make Hunt a force to be reckoned with and feared. So, if you're a fan of Woo's action films and you want to see Cruise act like Chow-Yun Fat, then go see this movie. But, if you are expecting anything else, like a great love story and a thought-provoking plot, then save your money and wait until Mission: Impossible 2 comes out on video."

And while Woo is a stylistic director, does he have to keep reminding us? The slow-mo, the constant use of pigeons and doves, the focus on flowing fabric in the air - yes, John, we know you made this movie - your signatures are all over it like a graffitti artists overdone tags.<br/><br/>
The romance storyline was unneccesary - in love after one night? I guess ultra-good looking people don't have to build relationships like the rest of us normal folks. <br/><br/>I would even say there are two nods to Star Wars. The opening credits shift to a starry sky, then the camera drops to the skyline. Every SW movie opens this way. <br/><br/>POSSIBLE SPOILER HERE And the other is the entry into the Biotech company's building. The fortress of security is penetrable through a shaft (not for ventilation but light) - it's the one place of weakness. Is it just me, or isn't this like SW Ep 4's blowing up of the Death Star?<br/><br/>
Overall, I enjoy picking on these little things, but as your action movies go overall, still a good escapism. However, I have to agree with other comment writers that the violence was ultra-high. The PG-13 was probably because of little or no profanity, and no nudity - the ratings board is all screwed up -you can kill and maim and get a PG-13, but Jason's Lyric was slapped with an NC-17 for making love."

","Well, the ending was exciting. That was about the only thing a person can say about the otherwise dull ""Mission: Impossible 2."" John Woo does an admirable job, and Tom Cruise does a good job with his new set of martial arts moves, but otherwise this is a rather vapid film. In comparison to the original, which had far too much plot, this time around there's far too little.<br/><br/>At no point in this film is there any sense of mystery, of deception. It's straight-forward, bubble-gum entertainment, wrapped around a marketable star and a director who really only gets to show his stuff in the last third of the film.<br/><br/>The movie also suffers from a dreadful lack of character development, with Ving Rhames being woefully underused. Similarly, the Australian pilot who's also part of Ethan's team is introduced and then... well, he faded so fast from the plot that I can't even remember the character's name.<br/><br/>The action towards the end is quite entertaining, but it's too contained at the end of the film. It almost manages to save this movie... but not quite. ""Gladiator"" still reigns as the top summer action movie, at least until ""The Patriot"" and ""X-Men"" show up in July. ""M:I-2's"" biggest highlight is the soundtrack, and that's not saying too much. Go see it for a matinee, but skip the full price."

","Before I commence with my actual opinion, I make it clear that I have not seen the original series (but I have seen the MI movie) so I won't refer to it or decide on how ""classic"" it is. Now, I do say that it didn't seem to catch the element of ""teamwork"" that pushed my interest in the original MI forward. Ethan Hunt goes on a solo mission blowing up stuff and finds a girl whom he must save. This is, in short, a James Bond ripoff. In fact, while I nearly dozed off during the ""plot development"" scenes, I almost forgot this was indeed Mission Impossible. No, I'm serious. But that doesn't mean it's bad; I'm a good fan of Bond movies, but I came to see the everyone-work-together-to-save-the-day type of movie, and I got James Bond and two guys whose roles revolve solely around getting their computer to work (and flying helicopters and firing one rocket to blow up a car. once).<br/><br/>
The love interest isn't believable at all. Unless you're a romance sap, have a crush on either Tom Cruise or Thandie Newton, or don't pay attention to love elements of a movie...you are going throw back your head, close your eyes halfway, and think about how much movie is being wasted away on this...well...waste. They meet, Cruise plays around with her to show off (like the security alarm scene when she was sitting on top of him. nice camera angle..almost qualifies for an R rating), they do stuff together for like a week (or maybe a month to be generous) and then Hunt becomes obsessive (""I won't lose you NOOOO!!"" come on its not even like their 3rd date). To accomplish such a task Woo compromised valuable action time to this element that shouldn't be in Mission Impossible.<br/><br/>Lastly, the chase scenes are cool, the gun scenes are cool, and the fight scenes are cool (cept some moves are faked. like Cruise could do THAT). Action-wise, it was delicious (mmm). The technology was cool too, but what bugged me was the revival of the pull-face-mask turns that are supposed to surprise us into shock or somethin. Well, not to sound boastful, but when I watched the movie with my friend Dave, we predicted every single mask-pull at least a couple minutes in advance (except for the very first one). What I'm trying to say is, if you're not gullible, it won't surprise you. So if you like surprises, don't think too hard. Oh, and if you quit IMF, do you get like proprietary Ethan Hunt masks or somethin? Or maybe each member gets somethin like Insta-face where you can design a facial model on a plaster case with hair in seconds. Don't worry, I'm not ruining the movie for you. You won't know what I'm talking about until the very end. Oh, and when semi-trucks hit cars, why don't they ever stop? They side ram a $100,000 car and it blows up and they keep driving."

","I understand that I, as one of the few who truly enjoyed Mission Impossible, am in the minority.  The plot of the first film was a little convoluted and vague at first, but upon my second viewing (and the mulitple viewings thereafter) I realized that it was not the density of the plot that confused me, but the intelligence of the writing, directing, and acting, an intelligence which is scarce in film today.<br/><br/>That said, part II has none of that.  This film is an excuse to watch Tom Cruise flip around, throw punches, silly kicks, and perform every gravity defying feat known to spy-hood.  Perhaps Cruise is making up for the fact that he hasn't thrown an on-screen punch since The Outsiders, and i cannot honestly remember him ever toting a gun onscreen.  Maybe it is a smart move on his part;  after all, he IS pushing middle age, and the body can only take so much abuse past 35.<br/><br/>A few points of comparison between the two movies:<br/><br/>TOTAL # of punches thrown by Cruise: Part I = a couple, Part II = too numerous to count;<br/><br/>TOTAL times cruise fires a gun:  Part I = zero,  Part II = 50 gazillion;<br/><br/>TOTAL number of explosions:  Part I = two,  Part II = 25 gazillion<br/><br/>The intelligence of the first movies was replaced in the second movie by john-woo-explosive-gun-slinging and a corny romance (with an unbelievably beautiful costar), with Jackie Chan-esque stunt replays, zooms, and fight sequences.  The plot is so simplistic that every single ""twist"" is blatantly apparent 15 minutes before it happens.<br/><br/>If you want to see Con Air/The Rock/Face-Off Part II, see this film (i am sure everyone will)...but do not expect to be held in suspense by the story, the acting, or, and especially, the IQ factor."

The action in the last half hour is outstanding and true to Woo form... but unfortunately what we're left with is an unbalanced film.  Woo fans, like myself, we're hoping for this insanely paced action throughout while some Mission Impossible fans will actually be disappointed with the route these final action scenes take the film to it's ultimate, and unsuspensful, ending.  I would have been much more pleased had the movie made up it's mind to be either a film in the style of the first Mission Impossible or a John Woo slugfest.

","I had a major gripe with the media as I walked out of the theater tonight. This is one really violent movie. An SUV filled with people crashes into some other cars, then flips over and explodes. Part of a man's finger is snipped off. A plane full of people crashes into the side of a mountain. And there's a fight scene in the end where the good guy and the bad guy pummel each other 10 minutes longer than even the best fighters in the world could have lasted. But all this violence is okay because it's good ol' fashioned Saturday night TV-Chuck Norris-25 kicks to the head before they fall down violence, and the film is given a PG-13 rating. Meanwhile, Fight Club (a movie I absolutely loved), which only has three or four short, but realistically violent scenes, gets major slack in the media for its depictions of violence. Just as long as there's no actual blood, you could pretty much do whatever you want in a movie. You could probably shoot a man 15 times in the head in a movie, and as long as there's only one small wound with minimal blood the MPAA will let your 13 year old see it and the movie will be hyped as the feel good movie of the summer.

","Well okay, let me start off by saying that this movie did have its good points, even one moment of genious.  But the rest sucked!  Warning spoilers throughout so be wary if you haven't seen the movie!<br/><br/>Okay, all the slow motion stuff was bad.  I mean its cool if you use it now and then for the really cool stuff, but not ALL THE TIME!  Like in the begining when he jumps from the cliff, that was cool.  But I dont need to see it in slow motion evertime he does a little flip that's not really even that complicated.  I swear, virtually every stunt he did was in slow mo, and most of them weren't that complicated, we don't need to see everything slowed down just to see Cruises hair fly all over the place.<br/><br/>Story:  Story not that good, love story didn't even develop, there might be a lot of missing footage from that.  Bad guy not that bad, rather flat actually.  I was actually bored for at least 45 minutes while the story ""developed"" which it really didn't.<br/><br/>Action:  Now since this was John Woo I thought the action scenes would be great, but they weren't.  They sucked.  The motorcycle chase has its moments of coolness, but also its moments of obsurdity.  Like when Cruise and the villain jump off their bikes and hit each other and fall off the cliff, how dumb was that.  People were laughing because that belongs in a cartoon. And why, in the biotech building, when he was supposed to be hurrying, why was Cruise slowly walking everywhere?  And it wasn't slow motion, he was just walking dramatically slow, and right before he can destroy the last of the virus he pauses for like thirty seconds thinking.  That was sooooooo dumb. The mask thing was cool at first, but they did it so often at first that it got confusing, I really think there was a lot of cuts made to this movie, cause things didn't seem right.  The last time they did the mask switching was cool, that was the moment of genious in the film, but every other time they did it it was dumb.

It reeks with cliches, and unlike the first Mission Impossible, it has a scattered plot that never actually redeems itself.  De Palma used confusion and a variety of locals scenarios to pull in the viewer to a thrilling climax on a speeding train.  Woo merely gets Tom Cruise to do some incredible stunt work and calls it a movie.  Yes, the special fx are great,  yes, the motorcycle scenes were jaw dropping, and yes, who cares that nobody could screech to a halt on the front wheel of their yamaha and still pick four passengers out of a moving car with only four bullets in real life.  But, I've said it before and I'll say it again.  No amount of spfx, stuntwork, or popular music groups on the soundtrack can make up for a poorly executed plot. And on a personal note, I usually enjoy Hans Zimmer's scores.  He's very versatile.  From As Good as it Gets, to Prince of Egypt, to The Thin Red Line, he is great at crafting the music to the visuals.  But fresh off the heals of composing the score for Gladiator, so brilliantly referencing ""Mars"", as well as utilizing Lisa Gerrard for the ethereal feel of the supernatural, Zimmer seems to copy himself with a similar sound that cheesifies the closing of MI2 instead of empowering it.<br/><br/>It seems Cruise (Mission: Impossible 2) does better with De Palma(Mission: Impossible) and Cage (Snake Eyes) does better with Woo (Face Off).<br/><br/>4 of 10"

","There's no real way to describe how I felt about ""Mission: Impossible 2"". Perhaps the only way to put it is that if the first film's glaring problem was that there was too much plot, the second film's glaring error is that there is too little plot. Bottom line, ""M:I-2"" simply can't be held afloat by its special effects alone.<br/><br/>However, the action sequences are what makes this movie a benchmark for future directing. Employing bullet time photography (last seen in ""The Matrix""), the special effects team has created the most amazing action sequences this side of ""Gladiator"". As a requisite of the filmmaking techniques of John Woo (""Broken Arrow"", ""Face/Off""), ""M:I-2"" is chock full of heart stopping action, accompanied by the presence of white doves fleeing battle, and enough over-dramatism to make Baz Luhrmann blush.<br/><br/>The main problem lies in the same fact that made ""Battlefield: Earth"" a terrible miscalculation: The ability of big name stars to produce their very own pet projects. Tom Cruise obviously had a little more than a lot to do with the way in which the film was put together. The entire plot revolves around his character, the neo-Bond IMF agent, Ethan Hunt. Cruise claims that the only thing that remains the same about his character is the name. He's right in that respect. Gone is the clean cut, debonair but calculating, and most importantly, vulnerable, Ethan Hunt. Arriving out of left field is the brand new, so fearless he's almost stupid, ""I would do anything for love"" Ethan Hunt.<br/><br/>Just on an up note, the stunts in this film are simply amazing. I would like to extend my personal kudos to Tom Cruise for volunteering to do the rock climbing scene himself. John Woo wanted to make himself perfectly clear when stating that all the stunts were done old-fashioned, and were only ""slightly"" enhanced by CGI manipulation.<br/><br/>I am personally unsure of what point was being made by the production of this film. What it boils down to is the shameless use of two hours and ten minutes as a vehicle for new special effects techniques. Making her appearance as Nyah, an internationally renowned thief and love interest of Mr. Hunt, is Thandie Newton. While Miss Newton CAN act, she can only do so in the respect that she's the perfect Woo heroine: spunky and sexy. The regrettable fact is that it feels throughout the film that they built a complex, promising plot and realized they had to shave away at it to jam in a hammed up love story.<br/><br/>The presence of Anthony Hopkins is a plus, but it's obvious that he is only present to add another high profile name to the marquee. The sad truth is that Sir Anthony is only given a sparse four or five minutes of screen time.<br/><br/>The final product: This film should have been looked over seriously before release. It's not half as complex as the last film, which will, regrettably, be a plus in the minds of most moviegoers. The overacting is anything but endearing, and the villain is nowhere near believable, but that's Hollywood. The special effects are amazing, but a tad over-the-top (see car chase/carousel ride). And we come to an end result that we should leave the acting to the actors and the directing to the directors. Sorry, Tom. Swinging for the fences doesn't always bring a home run."

This is perfectly fine for the incredibly choreographed action sequences. But the periods in between those times shouldn't feel so fake. Also, John Woo really needs to cool it on the slowmo.

Back in his ""Top Gun"" days, maybe, but today his protagonist characters are old.  For once, Cruise, be versatile!  The love story between ""Ethan and Nya"" was irritating and unbelievable. John Woo is definitely an ""action"" director, however the slow motion camera movement, every 5 minutes, was on the verge of being annoying.   As for Dougray Scott, I hope your superb acting doesn't reflect that this movie was a disappointment for me.  You definitely can act, Scott.  You proved that with ""Ever After"" and ""MI2"".  Keep it up!  I was pleased to see Anthony Hopkins appear as a cameo. I must admit the only reason I paid for this movie was because of Scott and Hopkins.  I personally don't think that they were able to carry this movie, because Cruise ruins it for me, hands down.  Sorry Cruise fans better luck next time!"

","I came out from this movie tired. It was like watching some monstrous crossing between The Killer, James Bond and The Matrix. John Woo's trademarks are no more a style signature, they're just a cheesy, tiring mannerism. The action scenes are directly imported from The Matrix - but without the excitement of discovery they are tiring, repetitive and gratuitously violent. The fast-slow-fast rhythm of the movie is predictable and tiring. The way Thandie Newton minces all around is tiring. The Scottish accents are tiring. The all too visible ads for Bulgari and Audi are tiring. The whole thing is one big tiring plagiarism, with too much deja vu. Yawn."

","Why bother calling it Mission: Impossible?  When you go to see a movie based on MI you expect to see the MI formula: a cool team of spy-types who had everything under control, and even when they hit a snag they had a way around it.  Plus, they didn't need to commit mayhem - if someone needed to be killed the IMF made it their mission to get someone to do it for them. MI:2 should have been called ""Generic Summer Action Flick 2K"".  At least then we would have known what kind of crap to expect."

","That was the phrase I bellowed at the top of my lungs as I exited the theatre.  That can be the only reason this movie turned out like it did. Ever since I heard a year or so ago that there was a MI2 being shot and John ""The Master"" Woo was at the helm, I've been licking my chops waiting for the second coming.  Then I heard it was PG-13.  Oh, no; spider sense tingling. That's OK, I can deal with that because the trailer looked awesome.  Tom's doing his own stunts with hints of Capoiera.  My excitement steadily grew. Then again, most crappy movies have great trailers.<br/><br/>The day finally came when I was able to be ""WOOED"" once more by the master of disaster.  My girl and I showed up 40 min early because I didn't want to fight for the last seat in the front, ten inches away from the screen.  The lights went down on a sold out crowd and I waited intensely from the magic to begin. The first 30 min of the film had me thoroughly enthralled.  I like rock climbing so the opening sequence was amazing.  Was that really Tom Cruise hundreds of feet high climbing without a safety line my girl asked. Looked real to me.<br/><br/>Then all of a sudden something went terribly wrong.  The film got BORING. I love character developement, plot, drawn out conclusions, the works.  But, only if they work.  The chemistry was not there between Tom and Thandie, which I might add is very hot.  A far cry from ""Beloved"".  Tom seemed as if he was bored also just going through the BAD dialogue.<br/><br/>Mission Impossible is about teamwork not how good Tom looks in cool duds. This movie should have been called something else because it had absolutely nothing to do with MI at all.  Where the hell was the espionage.  That was the essential ingredient to the TV series and it was totally lacking.  I hate when these Hollywood hacks think they can re-write history and totally destroy everything that was good about the show in the first place.<br/><br/>John Woo making a PG-13 movie should have been a dead give-away that I was in for a disappointment.  You can not edit his carnage to get a PG-13.  You will undoubtly piss off the LEGIONS of WOO fans as this message board has indicated.  Hollywood should be good for one thing, providing talent with financing, that's it.  Keep your ideas to yourself.  I am a filmmaker whose first release ""The American Dream"" will be released Fall 2001 and I can't tell you the ridiculous scenarios producers have told me to add to my film. It's a sad situation.  Hollywood is slowly sucking the life out of John Woo. He hasn't made an American film as good any of his HK stuff.  Face/Off was about the closest he has come.  And that couldn't match ""The Killer"", ""Bullet in the Head"", ""Hard-Boiled"".<br/><br/>Ving Rhames and Anthony Hopkins should really have done something else with their free time.  These guys are great actors who deserve better than to be put in the background with BS dialogue.<br/><br/>Here's a hint Hollywood.  The next John Woo flick better not have PG-13 rating.  His films are NOT for children by any means.  Remember ""The Matrix"" made over 400 million worldwide and counting and it cost about half of what MI2 cost.  And as far as MI3 goes, the plot is not supposed to be on a 3rd grade level.  So many people complained that MI1 was too complicated. THAT'S THE POINT.  The plot is suppossed to grab you, confuse you and keep you enthralled, waiting to find out how's it all going to end.<br/><br/>Just a thought."

Now, what do we have in MI:2 ? A story that's been done thousands of times (scientists created a deadly virus and a bunch of bad guys steal it to become rich, doh), a flat love story for the girls, and last but not least 2 hours of completely unreal and stupid action scenes that make James Bond look like a kid. It's like a bad James Bond movie pushed to the extreme. When you see guys flying over bikes at 100 miles/hour that dont get injured when they hit each other you wonder if you are not seeing Robocop 10 or something... The biggest problem is the over used mask thing, there's a guy taking someone else's identity every 10 minutes and at a time he was wearing 2 masks on top of the other, and of course they are so perfect they can fool anyone right in front of them. We don't even learn anything on the characters, they are just like moving and talking muppets. Trust me, almost everything in this movie is bad, this is the perfect hyped piece of crap from Hollywood luring people in theatres.

","Tom Cruise made 2 major mistakes when producing this movie. #1.  The Script!  The plot was sooooooo weak and boring!  It had nothing to do with the concept of Mission Impossible.  It was a James Bond movie, cept the main character was named Ethan Hunt. #2.  Supporting Cast!  This movie stars Tom Cruise, Tom cruise, Cruise Tom, Mot Esiurc, TOM CrUisE, and Thomas Cruise.  The supporting cast gets barley any lines, I mean the only good actors in it were Anthony Hopkins and Ving Rhames, and they literally had 4 minutes of screentime each!<br/><br/>Now the plot in this movie drags on for 90 minutes.  Luckily John Woo saves it a little by putting in some sweet cinematography and some good music. But even he couldn't save this TERRIBLE script and boring insulting to the audience plot. There is no action until the end of the movie, but when the action starts it is INSANELY awesome.  John Woo is by far the best at capturing the intensity, and is brave enough to shoot a shot for more then 10 seconds, unlike most American directors who like to cut a lot to save money.  As a huge John Woo fan, I was not letdown at all but was instead impressed as the action in this movie is TOPKNOTCH.  But it just doesn't seem right for a Mission Impossible movie, I mean the whole reason the first one was cool was because of the complicated plot and the flashbacks, not the little boring train helicopter thing ripped off from SUPERCOP at the end!<br/><br/>John Woo deserved a better script to work with, but hey I forgot this is Hollywood not Hong Kong.  After all these years Hollywood still thinks audiences are UNINTELLIGENT, and can get away with saving a buck or 2 to buy a crappy script.  The potential of this movie was incredible, but even the god himself, John Woo, couldn't save this movie from the script (which was written for Tom Cruises ego).<br/><br/>Watch Face Off, Hard Boiled, and THE KILLER if you want to see some action and CHARACTERS.<br/><br/>My grade: B-"

","M:I-2 stays away from the normal sequal rehash formula. Similar to the Alien franchise, M:I-2 is a completely diffirent animal than M:I-1.  It isn't even the same genre: M:I-2 is clearly an action movie directed by an action director (John Wu), where as the focus on M:I-1 is suspense and James-Bondism.  Secondly, the plot in M:I-1 was full of twists, and complicated motives.  M:I-2 stays clear of that with a simple plot, as follows:  villian steals object, hero tracks down villian, hero meets girl, hero stops villan.  Even the film's music is diffirent than the first one.  Bongos and flutes have been replaced with hard-rock, choir opera arrangments, and a beautiful balad for the female lead. Considering all of that, comparing M:I-1 to M:I-2 is like apples and oranges. If you want thick plot and espionage, see part one.

","This is unlike the original MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE, since both films are directed by two different directors.  For the original, Brian De Palma added action with suspense which was a good formula for bringing the t.v. series to the big screen. Now Asian director John Woo brings action with explosion for the continuing story of special agent Ethan Hunt. Tom Cruise returns as Impossible Mission Force agent Ethan Hunt, who's new mission involves retreving a deadly disease which was stolen from another IMF agent, Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott).  Ambrose is selling the disease to the highest bidder, otherwise, he'll release the disease on the planet causing a very deadly and gruesome results. The only way that Hunt can find Ambrose is through Ambrose's former love, Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton).  This takes the two over to Sydney, Australia where Hunt recruits two more IMF agents, including Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) who assisted Ethan in the original film. MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 2 is like watching John Woo's greatest hits. There are scenes and action scenes that remind me of Woo's other movies.  There are scenes that are similar from some other Woo films, like: FACE/OFF, THE KILLER, HARD BOILED, HARD TARGET, A BETTER TOMORROW, and BROKEN ARROW.  From the countless amount of slow motion action scenes, to the flying doves, there is Woo's signiture throughout this film.  Which is a lot more different than the De Palma masterpiece that we are all use to. But I still did enjoy the sequal to the 1996 film.  However, I didn't enjoy it as much as the original.  The original film was much more faithful to the television show with the super spy, government involved, and super gadgets that were like a American version of a James Bond film.  Part two, is more like FACE/OFF, where these people are authority figures, but they seem to know more kung-fu than using gadgets.  Perhaps that is what Ethan Hunt has been doing the past four years, learning kung-fu. The acting is so-so, I mean, it's no where as spectacular as the Travolta/Cage roles in FACE/OFF, or the Chow Young Fat role in THE KILLER.  Cruise is playing the same role that he plays in all of his action films, nothing special like his two previous films, MAGNOLIA and EYES WIDE SHUT.  While Dougray Scott is decent playing the villian. Overall, I didn't enjoy MI: 2, as much as the original, but it is enjoyable.  The action scenes are entertaining, but not suspenseful.  If Mr. Woo only watched some more Hitchcock or De Palma films before making MI: 2, he would have succeeded in bringing tension and suspense to the film.  But is it the biggest movie of the summer?  Na, I would say the biggest film this summer might be the one with mutants turned superheroes. **** (out of five)"

","I think that if I weren't a devotee of Woo's early work I'd have enjoyed this film more than I did.  I mean, let's face it... the trademark action sequences are as beautiful as ever and the cinematography is wonderful (I noticed that the cinematographer recently worked on Stigmata; thank goodness Woo kept him in line and didn't let him turn this one into an MTV video like Stigmata became).  If I were expecting nothing more from a Woo film than mind-blowing action, my appetite would have been more than sated.  The problem is that the action simply isn't enough.<br/><br/>Before coming to Hollywood, John Woo's trademark, aside from the over-the-top action choreography, was an abiding, common theme of loyalty, honor, betrayal (usually), and the bonds of friendship (usually of the male-bonding variety).  It was these elements which always elevated his movies above the standard pulp-action fare, making them something for the mind (and heart) as well as the eye.  One need look no further than The Killer or, especially, Bullet in the Head to see these themes exemplified. His American efforts thus far, however (with the possible exception of Face/Off), have been sadly lacking in this department, opting to give us straight up eye candy with none of the emotional involvement.  At best, we get the old ""main character turns out to be a bad guy"" cheese which ultimately has no bearing on the film itself; sure it's a surprise when it happens (maybe), but in the end it's just another Good Guy Vs. Bad Guy action flick with little to no soul.  I'd like to think that this is a result of Woo being less involved with the writing aspect of the films than he was while working in HK.<br/><br/>My point is that M:I2 is no exception to the rule.  Again, it sure is nice to look at (most of the time), but in the long run it's fairly hollow. Tom Cruise is a good actor in his own right and is passable as the main character, but (and I hate to say this) he's no Chow Yun-Fat.  Of course I realize that John Woo and Chow Yun-Fat are not necessarily synonymous, but there are certain things with which a director like Woo can get away when directing an Asian actor such as Chow which simply don't work in a big-budget, Hollywood production.  In a film such as Hard Boiled or The Killer, seeing the hero walk across a burning doorway in slow-motion, making eye contact with the bad guy as the flames reflect in his eyes is acceptable, even expected.  Seeing Tom Cruise do it elicits snickers and groans from the audience.  Whether or not this has any basis or foundation is irrelevant; that's just the way it is.<br/><br/>The verdict?  Woo needs to work in Hong Kong again, period (which he is, for King's Ransom, which should be incredible).  I have no problem with taking some money from Hollywood to increase the production standards; Ang Lee's upcoming Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (distributed by Columbia Pictures) is going to be a good example of how the two systems of filmmaking can work together to create a quality piece of work.  Hollywood simply doesn't understand that a director like John Woo can make almost anything look good, but that that doesn't necessarily equal quality."

If you want to see John Woo try to impress everyone with lots of slow-motion shots and watch Tom Cruise over-act in a tawdry melodrama, go see the first half of this movie and slip out before the second half.

","Remember the good ol' days of watching Scooby-Doo on Saturday morning cartoons?  Every episode ended with the monster pulling off its rubber mask, revealing the real villain - usually some elderly disgruntled carnie.  At least Scooby-Doo only used this plot device once (maximum twice) per episode.  Mission Impossible 2 punches the envelope in a most pathetic way, utilizing this shallow plot device at least four times (perhaps even five). Gimme a break. John Woo's stylization of action sequences has been admirable in the past, but in this piece his over-use of slow motion is laughable.  I'm sure if the entire film was shown in real-time, it would only last 37 minutes.  It might look cool for a fight, but not for an entire feature. Tom Cruise places great faith in his image, taking the same self-glorifying risk that drowned Kevin Costner's career in Waterworld.  We all know how cool Tom Cruise is - but this much flexing and posing would be far more appropriate in an issue of Playgirl than on the screen, thank you very much. Despite my own distaste for the film as a whole, I must confess that the motorcycle chase scene at the climax of the film may be one of the most exciting and innovational chase sequences since The French Connection. Next time, build a better film to lead up to it."

","Mission: Impossible 2 follows the rules of any good summer action flick; there's plenty of stunts, explosions, and gunplay, all wonderfully directed and choreographed by the man who elevates cinematic violence to an art form, director John Woo.  Too bad it's all crowded into the last hour of the movie.  Indeed M:I-2, which, apart from characters Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and Luther (Rhames) seems to be connected to the first film in name only, tries to cram so much action into the last 60 minutes, the first half seems rather dull in comparison.  The effect is akin to waiting an hour for food, and eating all of it so fast due to hunger that you don't get a chance to enjoy it.  M:I-2 would have been more engrossing if the action was spaced out better.  Aside from this, M:I-2 is a totally watchable, fairly entertaining action vehicle.  The plot lacks the wonderful espionage motif of the first M:I, but suits the more action-oriented nature of the film . Of course, John Woo's action sequences are top notch, though they are somewhat generic compared to the more imaginative action pieces in the original (nothing in M:I-2 measures up the spectacular TGV / Chunnel sequence in the original; IMHO one of the best action sequences ever put to film).

"neo_jenner","7","0","0","15 May 2000"," Not as good as the first, but John Woo saves it from mediocrity.
","MI2 is a mixed bag. Overall, yes, it is a great movie. But compared to the first Mission Impossible or John Woo's Face/Off, it doesn't hold up. What hurts MI2 more than anything is the script. The threat of a super-virus is not only laughably lame, but about five years out of date. Also imbedded in the story is a romance between Ethan Hunt and a master thief named Naya that is particularly straining. Essentially, MI2 became a James Bond movie, but even the relationships presented in Bond movies never seemed this serious from the get go. There's even a scene where Cruise says to her ""Stay alive no matter what!"" as if it were ripped right out of Last of the Mohicans.<br/><br/>Also, none of the supporting characters ever get a chance to grow. In the first MI, each character was fleshed out terrifically were in MI2 they simply stand by and watch Tom Cruise do everything. I think the only reason Ving Rhames is in this is because he was in the first one. MI was subtle, smart, and suspenseful. MI2 is loud, and over the top.<br/><br/>So what was good about it. Trust me, after the hour long exposition, you will forget about every complaint I've said because the action that takes place is simply breathtaking. Visually, this is Woo's most stunning work so far and just as he did with Broken Arrow, Woo saves the movie with style over substance. The final motorcycle chase is flat out jaw dropping. All of the shoot-outs are staged to perfection and you won't even notice that PG-13 rating hampering Woo's style at all. If you've ever yearned to see several slo-mo shots of Tom Cruise walking/riding/jumping through flames, your prayers have been answered.<br/><br/>However when it's all over, it just won't seem right. The original was unique in its ability to hold back from blowing everything up. In MI2 there is no holding back. And while that's okay to an extent, sometimes great tension and suspense can be a better payoff than ten-thousand bullets destroying everything in site."

","When I first heard that John Woo was doing another movie, I thought great. When I heard that it was mission: impossible 2, I thought awesome.  When I learned on Tuesday before it came out that 40 minutes had been cut out, I became leery.  Yes, you heard me right, this is not the director's cut of the movie.  OK, maybe it is, but it is not the first cut.  Apparently the first cut was patent John Woo with more violence, going for an 'R' rating, and much less romance.  It was John Woo, but then the studio brought in a guy who cut 40 minutes out, and added some romance between the two characters.  But enough of that, the actual movie review:<br/><br/>This is not John Woo.  It had some parts in it that were great, but the movie's pacing was sort of off, and the action scenes were a bit choppy. The rhythm that Woo generally has is absent.  See the scene in Face/Off featuring Somewhere over the rainbow for a good example of that, or the church.  But Woo is a master, and studios should not tough that.  The plot is inane, but I didn't care.  My point was that it should have been fun and more intense.  Either way, I don't think that I could sit through this again, except for if they restore it.  I can't wait for the DVD, maybe they restored the first cut, but until then see Gladiator.  I sat through that twice, and would go again.----5"

","Mission Impossible II: When you're Ethan Hunt, superspy extraordinaire, nothing ruins your day quicker than a madman peddling a stolen killer virus that could spell global genocide.  But, then again, it's not that unusual either The main complaint about the first theatrical version of Mission Impossible was that the story was too convoluted and consequently most people couldn't follow what was going on.  Personally, I disliked the movie because of the weak characters, lack of tension, and the horribly choreographed action sequences were (the helicopter-in-the-Chunnel scene was the final straw for me). <br/><br/>Not wanting to repeat the past, the producers mercilessly dumbed down the plot for this one.  Unfortunately, they did it a little too well: the story bogs down whenever the guns aren't blazing, the dialogue sounds like they pulled it from a dime-store novel, the love scenes are tepid, and the villain embodies apathy at best.  Thank god for John Woo!<br/><br/>Woo achieved virtual demi-god status as a director of Hong Kong action films and it was only a matter of time before he was wooed (no pun intended) by Hollywood.  Although his first North American features - ""Broken Arrow"" and ""Hard Target"" - enjoyed only a modicum of success, the public took notice with the release of ""Face Off"".  MI 2 proves that he just keeps getting better. <br/><br/>Anyone familiar with his work would instantly recognize the trademark Woosims in this film: fluttering doves, slow motion action sequences, beautifully choreographed bullet ballets, adrenaline pumping car chases and impossible stunts (amazingly Cruise did most of his own stuntwork, much to the chagrin of Woo and the studio).  Although several of the action sequences border on the ridiculous (how many bullets can you fire at a fleeing hero without hitting him?  A whole lot), yet they are fun to watch - the last ten minutes of the movie are worth the price of admission alone. <br/><br/>

Early proof: Cruise is introduced climbing a cliff, an ooh-it's-really-him-climbing moment a la William Shatner in ""Star Trek V,"" a scary indication of where the movie is headed.<br/><br/>The movie then rolls over and dies, desperately in need of an editor and delivering exposition slower than Woo's patented slo-mos. The villain is yet ANOTHER rogue agent - apparently, psychological testing is not yet part of the IMF training program. There is an attempt at a Dougray Scott-Thandie Newton-Cruise love triangle, but the boys are so deadly dull that it's a wonder that Newton gives them the time of day. Newton is all dreamy-eyed, amazing-cheekboned, smirking sexuality; if one good thing comes from this movie, it's that she'll get more work (in better movies). And remember how imposing and dangerous Ving Rhames was in ""Pulp Fiction""? Here, he's behind a laptop again, when he should be mixing it up with the bad guys, right along with Cruise.<br/><br/>A lot of familiar ground is covered. The villian apparently saw the first ""Mission: Impossible,"" as he correctly guesses that Cruise will penetrate a high-security building by lowering himself down on a wire. (If he does it again in ""M:I 3,"" I'm walking out.) Then he's a moving blip on Rhames' screen, sneaks around, and blah, blah, blah.<br/><br/>Stuff gets blowed up real good when we finally get to the last half hour. We're treated to the same high-flying two-gun John Woo Nutcracker that you've already seen a dozen times before. It's entirely inappropriate for the genre, something the 007 movies have been guilty of as late, also. Our spies used to outthink their opponents and ingeniously escape deadly situations; now they just mow the bad guys down with a submachine gun. Thanks to new back-end deals, Hollywood screenwriters are making bigger bucks now than ever before; the studios should demand smarter scripts.<br/><br/>Even so, I'm afraid that even those of you just looking for a summer ""popcorn"" movie will walk out disappointed.

","Tom Cruise has now proven that he can do what Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee have done. That is, star in a movie made by a Hong-Kong film-maker. Clearly, the plot is not so relevant in MI-2.  Rather, what is important is the action and pace. In this addition (in my opinion better than De Palma's Mission Impossible) Woo wows us with motorcycle and car chases. Gun fights, and the inevitable kung-fu showdown on a cliff. Most of the action in the film takes place in Australia, and what the distributors are indicating with this edition, is that the films will end up being very James Bondish.  In other words, they will feature the cars, the gadgets and the hot girls.  This edition's hot girl is Thandie Newton (Flirting, Beloved, Besieged)  She is hot.  She is a great actress, but I don't buy her as a cat-burglar. (I didn't buy Catherine Zeta Jones as a cat-burglar in Entrapment either)  But she's good to look at, now that her afro is gone, and her accent is normal (she is Australian, but has played Africans and American slaves recently) The main weakness in MI-2 is the villain.  He is unconvincing, and not scary. He is too similar to Tom Cruise which makes the whole mask thing work.  (They use lots of masks, fooling people into thinking they are someone else ... ie. Face-Off)  But, it doesn't make the story work. Anthony Hopkins is terrible. He shows up to the set to get his paycheck, but he didn't add anything to this film, except for his knighthood. The score is better than the first, it features a cool guitar lick by Limp Bizkit, some cool trancy stuff by BT and the usual genius score by Hans Zimmer.

Instead of giving orders, he seems to be making suggestions...  Ving Rhames does a lot of sitting, and the new Australian agent doesn't seem to make that much of an impact besides a little comic relief now and then.<br/><br/>All in all, you may like this movie if you're a fan of Tom Cruise or want to see a *decent* action movie, but if you're looking for the trademark Mission: Impossible ""undetectable spies"" and ""intricate plan"" elements, you're better off staying home and catching reruns of the original series."

","This movie was totally awful. Yes the ending was exciting with good action, but the story was pitiful and corny. It was painfully boring to watch this movie! There was absolutely nothing exciting going on until the end. I could barely keep awake. I'm not kidding. Even other people in the theater on the way out were saying the same thing. And even if the ending is exciting, it is a little bit over the top. ""Oh, Come On!"" was a phrase shouted frequently. And the final showdown between Tom Cruise and Doughray Scott didn't have as much excitement or intensity as did say the final Commudus/Maximus fight at the end of Gladiator. Probably because Gladiator was a good movie, and after sitting through the mess that Mission: Impossible 2 is, i just didn't care."

","Okay, maybe the plot isn't the best thing ever,and really no group spy movie will ever compare to Sneakers, but this movie is a bajillion times better than the first. I have to say that this is due to the director--John Woo. His action scenes are fantastic, and even the scenes where Cruise isn't doing anything too violent (the flamenco dancing scene in the beginning) are equally great. there are so many trademarks of Woo in this film that it can hold together the weak plot. Sure it's predictable, but it's fun. After all, what are summer movies for?"
"bernie-38","5","0","0","25 May 2000"," What happened?
","I love John Woo. The mastermind behind The Killer, Hard Boiled, Bullet in the Head, and even Face/Off has created a very exciting, visceral, tense action flick in MI2. But that's it.<br/><br/>The action sequences are very cool and fun to watch, but they are all just typical ""Woo-isms"" we've seen before: the excessive slow-mo, the dive and shoot executed by Tom Cruise (and by Chow Yun-Fat millions of times before), the stunts and jumps that can only be explained by non-Newtonian physics, and of course the doves. When there is action, it is very fun.<br/><br/>Everything else, i.e. the plot, was forgettable. Before I went to see MI2, I knew nothing about the story. After I saw it, I understand why: The plot was not worth talking about. Robert Towne wrote the screenplay (from the story by Brannon Braga and Ronald D Moore). He also wrote Chinatown which is a masterpiece in itself. How did Woo and Towne collaborate on such a piece of crunk?!?<br/><br/>Trying not to spoil anything. The main storyline is Ethan Hunt (Cruise) has to figure why a former spy has defected. The side plot (or maybe this was supposed to be the main plot, I'm not really sure) is the blossoming relationship between Cruise and a professional thief played by Thandie Newton. One of the things that really spoiled this movie for me was the inappropriateness of this ""love story."" I have no problem with the existence of a love interest in an action movie, but it didn't work here. They focused on it too much, but then trivialize it at the same time. It had no meaning, it was just trying to put two attractive people together half-naked in bed. If they want to make the love story the main part of the movie, I needed more. I needed to know why they like each other beyond pure attraction. I want more cerebral dialogue between them. I want to know more. In Chinatown, I wanted to know more about Dunaway and Nicholson, and then the movie gave me what I needed. MI2 fails miserably. The rest of the plot is slightly familiar if you've seen Twelve Monkeys (sans time travel).<br/><br/>And of course there's the acting. How can you go wrong with Anthony Hopkins, Ving Rhames, and Tom Cruise of a very impressive outing in Magnolia and a pretty good outing in Eyes Wide Shut. Hopkins is in it for an very unimpressive 2 or so minutes. Ving Rhames had some funny lines, but was also a non-factor. Cruise had his moments, but the rest was filled over-acting or non-acting. To Cruise's credit, he did do most of his own stunts a la Jackie Chan.<br/><br/>A major disappointment I had was the target audience, or rather how they made the movie to target their audience. I hate this fact about 90% of studio movies anyway, but it was so blatant. The PG-13 rating so that kids can go see it without sneaking in. A Woo movie is supposed to be an R. Without the R, much of the violence loses it meaning. Watch Hard Boiled and The Killer, the violence in those two movies mean something, a certain poetry that many critics have accredited to Woo. Second, the inclusion of the love story seems to attempt to appeal to a larger female audience. And of course the fast cars, fast motorcycles, and fast draws of guns always draw the masses of men (18-49). Lastly, the fact that it is a summer movie. I'm sure if there was less pressure to open MI2 on Memorial Day (wednesday), there would be more time to make a better movie. Imagine if this was given three or four more months and opened in September. I have to wipe the tears from my eyes.<br/><br/>All in all, MI2 is not worthy of its predecessor nor its legacy. Mission Impossible is a better movie even if the story is convuluted (it was still intriguing). Most of John Woo's previous movies are by far superior (although Hard Target is a glaring exception). Go to see MI2, it's a fun action movie with exciting stunts and special effects. Don't see it again because the plot is horrible and the love story inane."

","I saw the movie before reading any of the reviews.  When I got around to reading them, they were mostly negative.  John Woo has shown that he knows how to direct an action sequence, and his films are beautifully presented; the action scenes promise to show the audience something fresh and inventive (although some things can get tired by the end of the film) and they are shot with excellent clarity and a distinct style.  I've heard complaints about character development and the motorcycle sequence toward the end of the film.  If you want to see a movie with substance, go see Gladiator or watch American Beauty again.  If you want to see Bond with more style and less Denise Richardson, see M-I:2.  Action movies with character development are few and far between (I can only think of True Lies and Die Hard off hand).  Plot development in this film is mediocre at best.  But the action is what you paying for. M-I:2 isn't as good as Face/Off, in my opinion John Woo's best effort since his American debut, but far better that anything else since 1993.<br/><br/>Alex Geiger"

","Obviously, J. Woo has seen the film ""Matrix"", perhaps more than once.  But his attempt to duplicate the brilliant cinematographic style of ""Matrix"" falls on its face, flat and embarrassed in MI-2.  Woo is also too much enamored of a dramatic device he overworked in ""Face-Off,"" and works to death here - so much that scenes intended to shock gasps from the audience are instead stiflingly predictable.<br/><br/>This was NOT a joyful romp of special effects and fireworks - the action sequences could have been lifted untouched from James Bond episodes filmed in 1967.  The movie features (grab something now) a car chase!  Some explosions!  Guns firing!  Oooo!!<br/><br/>Neither plot nor editing had the least sheen of imagination; the entire production is the stale amalgamation of worn out thriller cliches.  And forget the dialogue.  Even Marvel comic books have dialogue more representative of how people actually speak, or feel (of course, selecting Tom Cruise for a role requiring emotion demonstrates a complete misunderstanding of Tom Cruise' thespian abilities).<br/><br/>No surprises (Woo thought he was creating some, but alas, his situations all had only one possible outcome, glaringly apparent, unless he was willing to abandon the deep rutted paths of Hollywood narrative and do something imaginative.  He never did).<br/><br/>Pass this one up - believe me, you aren't missing a thing."

","Here we have the classic question...can the sequel out do the original? Usually the answer is no, but this does not apply to the MI series.  The reason that most sequels fail is that they try too much to be like the original films, but not MI-2.  While Tom Cruise's character Ethan Hunt remains the same, the film makers did not try to make it connect to the first one, but rather they concentrated on making a new story.  The action sequences are one of a kind from the master of action John Woo. <br/><br/>
Despite the fantastic action scenes and the fairly solid story line, the film did have a few low points.  First on all, that love story seemed quite out of place.  I mean it was a change but it seemed a little forced.  Then there was that constant use of those masks that were made famous from the first flick.  I mean how many masks could they possible have!!??!!  And last but not least...I know that John Woo is famous for his remarkable action sequences and that his technique is to put portions of it into slow motion and then speed it up at the last second, but it was just used far to much in this film.  I understand that sometimes it is a good effect so that the audience can see exactly what is happening, but this time it was just overkill.   The movie would have been shorter if all these slow motion scenes were eliminated, because with them, it just seemed to drag on a little too long.<br/><br/>In spite of the minor problems that the film has, it will still make millions, because of Tom Cruise alone, but Thandie Newton did a wonderful job, playing opposite the star and Dougray Scott, who was last scene in Ever After, portrayed an excellent foil for Cruise's character.  Fans of both Cruise and the original television series will enjoy this flick, but first time MI viewers will enjoy it because you did not have to see the first one to understand what was going on in the second one, as is the case with most sequels.  All in all a good action-packed movie, well worth the money and definitely a big screen movie.  Don't miss this one at the theaters if you are into the big summer action movies.  I give MI-2 a 8 out of 10."

Tom cruise is a fine actor, and it seems like he wanted to break out the acting chops but was not allowed to do so (granted this isn't Born on the 4th of July).  The same goes for Dougray Scott (he made a great villain). There were great stunts, but you have seen them already in the trailer; also, they are pretty unbelievable, adhering to John Woo fashion.  The inevitable end fight scene would be fantastic, but John Woo's incessant slo-mo cuts are disturbing if not quite bewildering. Woo would have done well the follow a slower version of the Jackie Chan school of fighting, and left out the ridiculous slow motion; the fight would have been much, much smoother. You'll see what I mean when you see it...because you know you are anyway.  By the way, I don't want to slam John Woo, his films are entertaining when in the mood for them, but this would have been better if it wasn't so ""Hong Kongish"".

The movie was stylish and exciting, but just as often confusing.  DePalma understandably took a pass on directing this sequel, which was handed to action master John Woo.

","Mission:Impossible 2 arrives in theaters with a thud.  A noisy, preposterous boom, which is louder than any of the generic car crashes, bomb explosions, and gunfights, contained in the movie itself.  I would've never thought to consider the original Mission: Impossible as a good or even marginally good movie, but compared to this installment, the 1996 film is a masterwork.  We can only hope that Tom Cruise and his co-producer Paula Wagner decide against adding onto this completely joyless series.  John Woo takes over for Brian DePalma as director of this big-budgeted turkey which I implore you not to but a ticket for.<br/><br/>After an opening sequence that gives hope to the audience, even as it leaves us feeling unusually empty, the film almost completely runs out of steam before the halfway point.  This time around, taking the NOC-list's place is some stupid virus named the Chimera that could wreak all sorts of havoc on the world.  Topping off Cruise and Company's obstacles are the villains: a corrupt ex-spy (Dougray Scott) named Ambrose and his gallery of inept goons as well as the bigwig pharmaceutical company president (a wasted Brendan Gleeson).  Not even Anthony Hopkins, in a totally wasted unbilled cameo, can entice us to not be annoyed. Maybe Hopkins had an idea how bad the film was going to be and took his name off it.<br/><br/>Then come the unintentional laughs.  And I cannot believe that a talent machine like Cruise, mixed with the usually dependable Woo can actually deliver unintentional laughs.  But the sight of a white dove leading the way for Cruise as he walks through a blasted-open doorway was almost enough for me to get up and watch Road Trip again. At least that film had action.<br/><br/>What the film does have going for it is the always-reliable Cruise and his love interest, Thandie Newton.  The excellent Ving Rhames gets next to no screen time and had better become a leading man soon before he gets stuck playing uninteresting sidekicks (see the first M:I, Out of Sight, and Entrapment).  It's strange to think that a John Woo-directed film would have a love story as the only real attention-grabber, but Newton is completely ravishing and her chemistry with Cruise (doing his usual smirking and staring) is moderately successful.  Yet even this love story is recycled from Alfred Hitchcock's classic Notorious.  Other plot twists, if you could even call them that, I found myself guessing minutes before they happened. The amount of genuine thrills in M:I-2 are almost equal to that of five seconds of Frequency (released earlier this spring- see it if it's still around).<br/><br/>Which brings me to the lack of originality in M:I-2.  Not only is the romantic plot lifted from a film made almost 50 years ago, but also the action sequences in the movie feel insipid and totally unfresh.  We get carbon copy John Woo martial arts fist fights and shootouts by. John Woo. In the first M:I, there were a couple of decent thrill sequences (i.e. the safe break-in, the train climax) yet walking out of the theater, I couldn't think of one exciting situation in the whole M:I-2 film.  Never before has slo-mo been so completely drained of its worth (which isn't much to begin with).  Also, is Woo blind?  We get what seem like thousands of close-ups of our stars in the first half-hour alone.  Most of his film work just seems rehashed and distracting here, which may be what happens when you put two inflated personalities together in what they both think is their own film.<br/><br/>God save us from M:I-3 because we, the moviegoers, deserve more than absolute junk like this. How could so much time, money, and talent be spent on such an unentertaining, inane, and completely disjointed film?<br/><br/>GRADE: D-"

","This movie is entertaining but suffers from a complete lack of realism. The motorcycle scenes and the fight scenes are examples of not being realistic. People in the theater I was at were shaking their heads and laughing at the ""fight scenes"".  Also, John Woo must like slomo's because this film is full of them.  That is perfectly fine for the incredible action sequences but the periods in between those times shouldn't be so slow and feel so fake. The overall story line is good but it lacks several things. The last half-hour is really the only thing I would recommend.<br/><br/>And also, there are no scenes in MI2 that will be remembered as well as the scene in MI1 where Tom Cruise is suspended above a computer retrieving the NOC list.  There is a scene in MI2 where Tom is suspended for a few seconds but it's over rather quickly.  I was really surprised that Woo didn't slow that down as he did everything else.  In my opinion MI2 isn't terrible, it's just dull and not much fun... words never before used to describe John Woo films."

","When I saw the second sequence in which Tom Cruise, as Ethan Hunt, climbs cliffs in Arizona and leaps between them like Spiderman, I figured ""hmm, this must be like one of those high tech holo-deck training thingies they must have in the IMF now."" I was wrong. For some reason the audience is supposed to believe that these acrobatics can be performed by any human. And thus continues the movie.<br/><br/>This film was directed by John Woo, which was a great choice for the action sequences. Unfortunately, the movie itself didn't have much action in it until the middle of the movie, and the romance sequences between Newton and Cruise were very hollow and trite. The slow motion was overused, and the film was debilitated by the actors' tendency to overact to make up for an extremely weak script. The only shining moment in the acting department was Anthony Hopkins, who delivered his lines with good humor and life.<br/><br/>The team aspect of the Mission:Impossible series seemed totally lost. It seems Ving Rhames was only brought in for a few laughs and to be the guy sitting in the truck, while the other member of the team was the guy who flew the helicopter, while Cruise's Hunt was the superhero who scaled cliffs, did backflips, and flipped motorcycles while immolating the bad guys.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the movie seemed like a bunch of amazing action sequences overlapping a script that was a combination of a trashy romance novel, a world atlas, a comic book, and a cookbook. The characters performed feats from The Matrix, such as human mid-air collisions, but M:I2 didn't pull it off because it was happening in ""real life"" not a computer simulacrum."

","Well, the long-awaited John Woo's Mission Impossible 2 opened on Wed, so I went to see it, and as you may have already guessed, I was let down by a sequel again. There has been only two sequels that I really enjoyed more or equal to the first ones, and they were TOY STORY and THE GODFATHER.<br/><br/>
Well, anyway, the story, first of all, was typical and corny. There's a virus(i mean of course, how original is that?), and a psychotic tries to make money off of it by killing people with it and whatever. And of course, there's a love interest for Cruise and it gets personal, yadee yadeea... NOW, then there were the action sequences which I must say again, JOHN WOO RULES!!! Even though some of the sequences were EXTREMELY over-the-top and unrealistic,(how the bad guys empty an entire automatic clip at Cruise but they only hit the ground as Cruise drives his motorcycle by and Cruise shots off just a couple of shots with his pistol and still is able to kill all the bad guys), but still, it was one of those movies you want to just leave your brain before you go in, enjoy the ride, and then pick up your brain on your way out. <br/><br/>The unbelievable stunts with COOL slo-mo worked its magic as usual as in any other John Woo. John Woo attempted to tell a love story almost, but it did not seem to actually work. I was bored for about half an hour or so when the supposed ""story"" was unfolding, but was on the edge of my seats as I saw the fights and the FAST chase motorcycle scene that blew me away. It was a very different type of film than the first one, obviously, and obviously by the very very different directors. <br/><br/>John Woo made more of a new stylish-hip-cool-summer-blockbuster whereas Brian De Palma made more of the revival of the old TV show to the big screen with a touch of Hitchcockish suspense in it, rather than Woo's gun fights. Both I must say were good in different aspects. If you like Woo or just mindless action, you've got to see this on the big screen. If you're tired of mindless-no-brainer-action, stay away from this movie."

Incoherent, chopped, and glossy to the extreme, Mission:II will surely leave the ""I'll accept mediocrity"" crowd cheering for the rest of the summer. This is one of the most self-serving films that has been released in years. I am actually a Tom Cruise fan, but he loses many points for this waste of time. The villain is out of central casting, as is the supposed plot. Note to Ving Rhames: You are talented man! You have to stop appearing as the ninth fiddle in glossy b.s. Playing the great role of Marsalles Wallace in Pulp Fiction, Ving has went downhill ever since. Back to Mission. Anthony Hopkins, one of the true acting greats, shows up to accept a check for his downpayment on this L.A. Pad. What a waste of an appearance. John Woo is a puppet for the cats in Hollywood now. This film to me is even more incoherent than the original, screwed up Mission:I. This film has ""MONEY MAKING MACHINE"" written all over it. Oh well. GLADIATOR reigns over this wretched filth. The inside joke on Ethan grinning the entire film was funny but painfully obviously. Cruise pocketed around $70 Million for the original. He will probably top that with this one. Lay down the cash and get ready for plastic. Count the amount of close-ups and grins on Tommy's face. I could go on, but I won't. It's just a disappointing summer movie. What's next to see?"

","I thought the first Mission Impossible movie was awful -- this was an improvement but only marginally so.  The movie starts well, with Cruise tredding on James Bond territory but as the movie wears on the somewhat interesting plot gets disposed of in  favor of typical action movie cliche. Instead of building suspense we get no less than 4 ""countdown clock"" sequences.  The  supporting cast is wasted in this Cruise vanity project -- they barely contribute to the mission at all.  Woo doesn't really attempt anything new here -- it's been a bit of deja vu with him since the fabulous ""Killers"".  My real complaint is for the use of the computer graphic ""masks"" that play a prominent part in the plot.  It's a far too convenient plot mechanism designed to move the story forward -- and very arbitrarily at that.  It reminds me of how grade school students might write their way out of a story -- deux ex machinas!!  This from the great Robert Towne and Brannon Braga (of Star Trek TNG fame).  Smells like writing by committee. Mission Implausible Too."

","I gave this movie a 4 simply due to it NOT being a 'Mission: Impossible' episode. In the TV, and even in the first movie, it was more of a team espionage show, but this was just another action movie. One major flaw was the recruiting' phase of the movie, where Tom has to charm Thandie Newton into doing the right thing. In the show, and even in different parts of the movie, they always use IMF members with those patented MASKS to fool the bad guys into spilling the beans. So why did they fell the need to recruit' an outsider? Well, that give Tom more screen time and the writers an excuse to put a sappy love interest in the movie. Weak.  On the plus side John Woo's choreography of fight scenes is still superb. Too bad they're used in excess, probably due to a lack of an intelligent script."

","Now M:i-2 may not be the greatest of Woo's work. (Go and see his Hong Kong films, they're amazing) The balletic gunplay was not very prevalent here. However the high budget meant he could do some amazing stunts the likes of which he could never do before. The film falls at the mask sequences. (To me it seems a very easy way of getting round things) However the action is as always mind blowing. I never realised it before but Tom Cruise is actually a great action star. He flips, dives, bikes, runs, climbs his way through this picture guns blazing leaving a trail of bad guys in his wake. (and it gives you an oppurtunity to go and see a film you'd like and your girlfriend won't complain) Basically (Spoiler alert) the film is not about mask sequences, viruses, or even action it is about Love. Only if Ican find a film about love with amazing special effects, high budget and John Woo choreographed action I'm in heaven. It still lacks his Hong Kong edge but Hollywood executives prevent Hong Kong style films. But in Hollywood even Woo can still work and produce good films. This film ranks as his Hollywood best. And Ok it may not have brilliant character development, the acting isn't too good and those mask sequences irritate me. but this film got style. hell it's got so much style people are slipping on it. (Cruise even pauses in a gunfight to put his shades on, how cool is that guy) Thandie Newton is as always a plesure to watch, and Dougray Scott manages a balance between over-the-top villain, and the subtle, haunted figure he is in some scenes. Overall I think it's a great film around 9/10... ah hell make it 10/10. It's fantastic and contains some of my favourite moments from any film ever. (The part in Biocyte when Nyah injects herself to keep Ethan safe and the dialogue, the romantic theme all against a contrasting backdrop of bloodshed and violence.

Whereas the first MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE was a suspenseful thriller with a sharply-written story, this sequel is just nothing but two hours of Tom Cruise. There's no sharp storyline, no well-executed sequences, no interesting characters, and worst of all, no team work. Cruise pretty much just does everything himself this time around, leaving co-star Ving Rhames in the background. Dougray Scott is a weak villain, Anthony Hopkins is wasted, and Thandie Newton is a disaster, one of the worst actresses I've ever seen. It's amazing John Woo could turn out such a terrible film. Some say BROKEN ARROW was bad, but this is Woo's absolute worst American movie thus far, but then again, you can't really blame the director. I would be tempted to blame the writer instead, but Cruise is probably the one to blame.

One very important one was left out, but I won't say which. The story was kinda lame, and I had a very difficult time believing the romantic edge of it, although I will admit that I do believe in love at first sight. But Tom Cruise and Thandie Newton had no chemistry between them.   And I always have a tough time with those  (Dark Man-ish) masks that they pull off their faces so that you can never tell who is really who.

As I said, kinda lame story, but I always love the technology, the toys and some of the most unbelievable action stunts ever.  I was disappointed that Tom Cruise didn't walk out of a hospital holding a baby, with a cigarette in his mouth, because that would have been a signature and a half.  Ving Rames was kept in the background and I would have liked to see him have more presence on the screen.  And Anthony Hopkins. I have no clue what he was doing in the three minutes he was in this movie.  For his part, really, anyone would have done. They should've saved the money and put it towards a better screenplay.  But it is a great action movie. And must be seen on the big screen to be truly appreciated. The locations were spectacular and majestic.  Although I could tell the Trekkers weren't thrilled that the Enterprise didn't show up to save the Earth this time. The rules about sequels never being as good as the first film do not apply here.

","I've heard that John Woo shot a load of action scenes and then tried to fit them into a film. I don't know how true this is, but it would explain a lot, particularly the early rock-climbing scene. The plot is predictable and silly (and overexplained, probably because the original was (unfairly) criticised for being confusing), involving a deadly virus and lots of people pretending to be other people with the help of rubber masks. Naturally, things get heavier when Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) falls for the fast-living criminal eye-candy (Thandie Newton). Newton's character brings the only real feeling to the film, and only at very few points is this anything more than a load of action scenes very stylishly shot (and very typically Woo, so no real surprises) but inexpertly cobbled together into a film.<br/><br/>As someone who's indifferent to the whole testosterone action stunts involving good-looking film stars malarky, I give it 3 out of 10.

MI:2 unfortunately didn't have the plot working in its favor and without a plot, the ""hokeyness"" and implausibility of every aspect of the movie was all that I could focus on. The stunts that Ethan Hunt performs are meant to make him look cool and almost superhuman. In actuality they just plain look stupid. From motorcycle stunts, to a Ducati Monster not being able to outrun a Toyota 4Runner, to the WAY too long fight scene at the end, the whole movie simply crosses the line into absurdity.<br/><br/>Todd"

","Spoilers within<br/><br/>Admittedly, when I watched this film, it was late & I was absolutely knackered, thus it had to be paused at least 3 times for the missus to explain what was going on, as it went way over my head.<br/><br/>I was somewhat surprised therefore to see reviewers complain of a tedious, weak plot. I agree with the many though that have said it was boring. This wasn't an awful film, but I certainly wouldn't recommend it.<br/><br/>As gorgeous as the female lead was, the romance was ridiculous.<br/><br/>Also, like so many films, it seemed to be all about the big, high budget finale & one or two other interspersed scenes with some fancy fighting. For the other 75% of the film though, very little went on, it seemed the plot (and I use the term plot in the loosest possible sense) was just plonked in without much thought, just as a prelude for the next stunt scene.<br/><br/>Yes, the stunts were impressive, amazing even, but anyone with half a brain knew exactly how it'd all end up. It was just a case of waiting for it. Wait we did. It must've taken 30 minutes just to close the story off & even the missus (who enjoyed it far more than me) had lost the will to live about 20 minutes from the end.<br/><br/>I also find films where people takes others faces off & swap them with there own very tedious. Had it just happened in the one scene on the plane at the start, it might just have been ok. But it had been repeated half a dozen times by the end, so you spend the rest of the film wasting your time wondering who is actually doing the speaking & missing the lines, as I obviously did. You half expected Tom Cruise to reach for a gun, only to peel off an outer layer of plastic & find it's an aubergine, it got that silly.<br/><br/>I spent years doing A-Levels & a degree, trying every method know to man to stay awake, while reading theories & attempting to store information in my head. Once those days are gone, you don't want go through it again, taking in spy films, where the characters are unlikely to mean anything to you.<br/><br/>Had this story been told by an old uncle or grandad & condensed down into 10 minutes, it may possibly have been interesting, but beyond that, it's just not really a story worthy of a 2 hour film.<br/><br/>Having slated it though, it's not awful. I've seen far worse films & one or two stunts are watchable in moderation, but in a time where nothing seems beyond stuntman & film crews, the days of making the audience go 'whoooah' are gone.<br/><br/>4/10"

","The problem with ""Mission Impossible 2"" is not that the movie is absurd. The trouble is that it is unplausible. We may accept with fun the supernatural acrobacies and the preposterous technology, as we are used to do in 007 movies.<br/><br/>But the main flaw, the unlikely behavior of the guys on the screen, cannot be swallowed. I mean: along the movie, the good guys has several opportunities to kill the bad guys, and very easily, too. Why they don't just do that? Moral scruples of the good ones? When the villains are threatening the survival of the whole human species? Come on! Dead men don't harm: any spy (or what else Ethan is) should fruitfully apply this axiom.<br/><br/>Personally, I was also annoyed by the so politically correct choice of the main bad guy and bad institution: a former CIA agent and a pharmaceutical company, respectively.<br/><br/>A little appeal: John Woo is very often called the new Sam Peckinpah. Please, don't say that! Please!<br/><br/>""Mission Impossible 2"" has some merits. The cinematography is magnificent.The movie is (moderately) entertaining. Tom Cruise is nice and acts adequately (but, since he's a beautiful man, he is commonly considered a bad actor: a little unfair cliche).

","<<< May contain spoilers >>><br/><br/>I expected nothing of what I expect from a good movie, like a story or believable characters. The hype around this movie was overwhelming, and all you saw in previews was split-second long bits of action sequences.<br/><br/>I didn´t know a thing about the story, and hey, why should they have told me of it anyway? The virus story was just a way to connect the cheesy action and to bore me to death. I usually don´t foresee even obvious twists in the story, but when there was only one injection left, I knew some good guy would be infected and the next step would be to get the antidote. I don´t mind plotholes (Matrix was full of them and I still loved it), if the rest makes up for it. I never saw the old series, but I saw the first Mission Impossible movie, and that one had a story. It was clever and confusing, which made it interesting. MI2´s story was just dumb, pointless and boring.<br/><br/>Same thing applies to the characters. Cruise is Cruise, all right. But did he really HAVE to pretend he was James Bond? The chick was just a chick falling in everlasting love with Cruise in no more than a second, the ""team"" could have been played by the computer and the bad guy, he just sucked, he had no charisma.<br/><br/>Last thing, the action. I believe that action itself is boring, unless it is really impressive and shows you something you haven´t seen a hundred times before. I liked the scene in the first movie where Cruise was hanging from the ceiling, not being allowed to touch the ground. It was so quiet in the theater, you could hear the people breathing. In MI2, there was just the fast-and-loud action that doesn´t allow any details. And the guy-and-chick-car-chase-on-mountain scene, tell me in how many James Bond movies we saw that before. *yawn*<br/><br/>2/10, for the car exploding on the bridge and the girl´s t-shirt."

","John Woo's ""M:I 2"" is, in many ways a well done action picture, but unfortunately, an insult to the ""Mission: Impossible"" name.<br/><br/>It almost seems as though somebody carefully watched all the old episodes of the TV show, and the original movie, and specifically disregarded all the elements that made it so famous... and great. For example, the IMF, the team that worked together through ingenuity and teamwork, has been scrapped in favour of Tom Cruise going solo. Another appealing element of the original M:I was the way in which all missions were accomplished through inventions and situations that seemed far-fetched and realistic at the same time, but in M:I 2, this too is forgotten in favour of 'magic' face and voice changers, that can somehow turn absolutely anyone into absolutely anyone else.<br/><br/>Another appealing feature was the way the team consisted of gritty hardworking people, just trying to get the job done, and not worrying about how they looked doing it. John Woo's vision of Ethan Hunt is almost the exact opposite, it often looked like the chase scenes were straight out of a shampoo commercial, and the ""scars"" looked like they were applied by Estee Lauder.<br/><br/>In the famous motorcycle duel scene, I couldn't stop thinking about how a member of the original crew would most likely just pull a head fake and double back and run the guy over after he flew off his bike, or just shoot the guy when, near the end, he is caught without a weapon (John Woo opted to have Ethan throw down his weapon. I guess his thinking was: The enemy died, but at least he died thinking ""Wow, Ethan, you fight with honour"")."

","`Mission: Impossible 2', on the surface, is a very good  not great  action movie.  Yes, it's kind of formulaic, but truly original action films are hard to come by.  `M:I2' covers all its bases, keeps the plot holes to a minimum, and avoids using too many of the standard cliches that litter the action genre.  It's a popcorn movie, pure and simple, and in terms of pure entertainment, it delivers fairly well.<br/><br/>I say that `on the surface' it's very good because . . . man, what a waste of director John Woo's talents.  This film had the potential to be absolutely mind-blowing in terms of action, effects, and fights, and instead, well, it's just good.  People unfamiliar with John Woo's Hong Kong films (`The Killer', `Hardboiled', `A Better Tomorrow', and so on) might think the action sequences of `M:I2' stand out as spectacular  and if they do, great, because then they're enjoying the flick  but for the most part, `M:I2' pales in comparison to Woo's Hong Kong films, despite `M:I2's bigger budget and stars.  (The only scenes that come close to Woo's best work are the opening rock-climbing sequence and a chase scene involving motorcycles.) Woo's Hollywood films never seem to hit the over-the-top intensity of his Hong Kong work; if the Hollywood brass is toning Woo down for a mainstream audience, they're making a huge mistake. The film is wall-to-wall action, and for the most part, it's darn good action, but good as it was, it could've been way, way better. <br/><br/>The story's okay  it deals with the hunt for a stolen bio-toxin, but it's really just an excuse to string a whole bunch of cool stuff together.  Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt is fine, and he seems to have fun with the role, but he's not exactly an engaging action hero  he doesn't come close to Pierce Brosnan as James Bond, or, for that matter, Bruce Willis as John McClane. Ving Rhames' reprisal of his role as Hunt's partner Luther is quite welcome  he's excellent, as usual.  Dougray Scott is pretty good as villain Sean Ambrose, but the biggest waste is Thandie Newton as Nyah, who's given little to do but serve as eye candy.  Yes, Ms. Newton is quite beautiful, but the lady can actually act as well, so a role such as this is an utter waste of her talents.  Cruise (as producer) could've cast any one of a dozen Victoria's Secret models as Nyah and gotten the same results.<br/><br/>Basically, `M:I2' is a fun film, definitely worth renting if you're a casual action movie fan.   If you're a die hard John Woo, fan, though, be prepared for some slight disappointment.  Grade: B"

","So many negative comments I just have to add mine.  I loved this film, it's one of the best action movies I ever saw.  Indeed the story is simplistic and indeed it's mainly a one-man show instead of a team operation but that doesn't take away this film includes a lot of stunning action scenes.  From the cliff hanging to the car chase (way too short but man I love that Audi TT Roadster :p), from the shootout at BioInc (or what was the name of that company) to the action at the island.  The bike chase, that man-to-man fight at the end, ...  John Woo did it this time... and BIG.  Best action film he did IMO.<br/><br/>One more word about the slow motion action scenes.  Man, I just love that. It looks very similar to those sequences from The Matrix but who gives a damn.<br/><br/>If you want a team-based Mission Impossible film with a twisted plot you might be disappointed but if you enjoy an incredible (and unrealistic at times - but who cares) action film then MI2 is exactly what you need.<br/><br/>I rated it 10/10 BTW, looking at it as a pure action film."

","Don't waste your time with this movie.  It was obviously made for the double-digit IQ, MTV crowd.  The story is weak, the dialog is non-existent and Tom Cruise is not acting.  The action is non-stop and boring as the scenes go on until you don't care what happens, you just want the segment to finish.  The characters are one dimensional, cliches that you might see in a bad kung fu movie.  John Woo may be known for his directing of action flicks but this movie goer wants more than car crashes, and slick editing.  Give me believable characters, interesting plot and intelligent dialog.  I'm glad I saw this with a free ticket."

","I'm not a fan of MI:2 for so many reasons, but none more than because they messed with everything, changed it all. I don't champion the original MI, but it was slick, it entertained, it made sense from one point to another. This sequel is just an ungodly mess. It's as if someone said 'can we take everything that was wrong with the original and amplify it tenfold'. Even Tom Cruise (who I thought was a perfect fit in the original) feels out of place ... doing weirdly angled kicks and spinning off motorbikes.<br/><br/>John Woo can make good movies, I know this, I think you know this, but this is far from one of them. I strongly wonder if he was the right guy for this project. I ponder this because I didn't even find the action scenes that great and we're talking about John Woo here. Between the doves, action scenes that seem so far removed from reality, we also get a bunch of people switching faces. The amount of times they use this convention to further the silly string plot is truly absurd. All wrapped in a flick that feels like nothing a Mission Impossible movie should feel like. Of course, saying all that, won't stop us from seeing a Mission Impossible 3. I just sincerely hope they get back to the basics and get it right the next time, but the way Hollywood operates, I'm not optimistic."

","Tom Cruise, back at his worst acting standards. I admit he is not one of my favorite actors, and despite the huge efforts that Hollywood made to include him in the big league I still have not seen him delivering a great performance. Certainly his performance in this movie is light-years from being noteworthy. With the help of a tiresome script, he desperately tries to be the ""anti-Bond"" cool cat, and the results are pathetic. But he is not even the worst thing in the movie. The storyline is... well, I would say ""predictable"" but that is an euphemism. All we get in this movie was seen before in other movies (mostly in average and bad movies, anyway). It is like a collection of the tiresome Hollywood standards for action movies. A futile love story, the usual bad guy that wants to do one of the standard bad things (I won't spoil it... just think of three things the standard bad guy from mediocre action movies would do, and you probably got at least two right). And the final fight... oh dear.<br/><br/>Although I've seen much worst stuff around through the years, it's still really depressing to see big budget movies delivering this kind of standard, predictable, futile junk.<br/><br/>3/10"

But, chances are you also watch the Saturday morning cartoons and think that they're really real, too.<br/><br/>This movie is way too confusing. Because characters routinely pull rubber masks off to reveal they're not who you thought they were, you never really know who you're looking at: Is this Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) or the bad guy? Is this the bad guy or his chief henchman? Is this the love interest girl or Anthony Hopkins?<br/><br/>Then, Ethan Hunt seemingly knows how to operate anything he comes into contact with, including highly-specialized and probably custom-built lab equipment designed for researching the world's deadliest viruses. Quite a guy, this Ethan Hunt.<br/><br/>The whole team seems to have access to more information, at all times, than one could believe they could possibly have access to. It's like there's some agency in Washington who computer geek Ving Rhames can consult to find out which living room wall my couch is against.<br/><br/>Speaking of Ving, I've known many computer geeks, and not one of them resembled Ving Rhames in any way at all. Is this not the world's worst casting choice? This is not a racial bias. There are plenty of black actors who who could be believable in this role, but Ving Rhames (a wonderful actor for lots of other types of parts) is the wrong guy for this role.<br/><br/>The dialog is so bad the audience laughed at it from time to time. There is a moment when Ethan Hunt look into the eyes of his lady luv and says something like, ""I am NOT going to let you die!"" Can you imagine James Bond saying something as weepy and whiny as that? No!<br/><br/>John Woo is one of my five favorite directors. He is probably the best action director on Earth. However, this is decidedly NOT one of his best films. DON'T go see this movie. Instead, rent Face Off, Broken Arrow, or even Hard Target. All of these are better films."

","MI2 has excellent action sequences.  In that regard, it succeeds as a summer action movie.  As a comedy, it is unintentionally funny.  It was hilarious to see how fast Tom and Thandie went from car chase to sex to love to self-sacrifice, I thought I was watching a porn.  It was hilarious to see Tom trying to act with emotional depth.  The characters/plot were very stupid, even by action movie standards.  I've also seen Hollow Man tonight and I have a hard time deciding which one is dumber. Big question: Is John Woo parodying himself?  Seeing Tom Cruise flying with 2 guns and trying to act cool a la Chow Yun-Fat makes me laugh so hard.  And what's with the doves?  In 'The Killer' and 'Face/Off', doves as an overt symbol of peace counter the struggle between good and evil.  In here without the dramatic tension (bland bad/good guys), it's corny and over done.  I rest my case.  Come on John, do you have to use doves, cathartic music and supposedly meaningful imageries for every movie or did Tom the producer force you into this?"

The 2nd installment, however, was over the top from the 1st scene.<br/><br/>If you thought it was a little unbelievable how Cruise was blown from the helicopter to the train at the end of the 1st movie, then expect nothing less than that [in almost every scene] in the sequel.  The effects became so absurd, that I had to listen to everyone around me laughing the whole movie.  And I hate, I mean hate, to hear people talk or laugh during a ""serious"" part of the movie.<br/><br/>I also did not appreciate the actress, Thandie Newton, who played Cruise's lover.  She made the same face during the whole movie...truly an untalented actress.  The face that she made was a cross between pouty and sexy, with her eyes always fixed.  It really got old after a while--almost a little comical after seeing the same expression for so long. But for some reason, the stone cold Ethan Hunt from the 1st movie was chasing her like a Mad-man during the duration of the MI:2.  Essentially, she drives most of the plot.  I couldn't buy into their intense spontaneous love and neither did most people in the theater.<br/><br/>On a positive note, however, the action in the flick was visually stunning.  I truly have no idea how Woo shot most of the scenes.  Woo over did himself.<br/><br/>In essence, the movie seriously lacked a plausible plot. The heroine couldn't act--she could only make a single (perhaps even goofy) facial expression.  And the action scenes were so spectacular, that they were unbelievable. The movie is clearly not a spy movie, but a demonstration of the latest special effects and jaw dropping action scenes.

This one even has a semblance of a believable storyline and the opening rockclimbing sequence was pretty cool.<br/><br/>Where M:I-2 lost it for me was in the overstylized directing by John Woo which at times took on almost campy tones.  His use of slow motion shots (particularly of pigeon wings flapping) irritated me and the overlong fight scenes with an obvious martial arts twist did little for me either.  Any of these devices used sparingly might have been interesting but Woo's overuse of them made me pay attention to the devices at the expense of letting myself go with the suspense that I should have been feeling.<br/><br/>The acting was okay and the character development consistent with movies of this genre (you are told their backgrounds and hot buttons from ""mission briefings"").  The script was alright but its plot twists were way too predictable and none of these twists really took the storyline where it didn't appear to be going anyway.<br/><br/>If you like this genre of film, go ahead and see it - there are far worse out there.

I think it's interesting that no one has noticed William Mapother yet (some relative of Cruise's) - he's worked in and on many of Cruise's films, and I think it would be worth finding out just what the relation is :) All in all, I'd buy a copy and I'm sorry we missed it on the big screen!

I shouldn't have to consider whether it was fun or not with talents the likes of Cruise and Towne attached.  This could have been--*should* have been--so much better.

They gave old reliable Ving Rhames nothing to do, and who the heck with this Simon Pegg lookalike who just laughed and did nothing?<br/><br/>The final scene of an extended car crash with stuff blowing up all over and motorcycle after motorcycle really let you know that there was no plot in this movie, so the director decided to blow things up all over.<br/><br/>It didn't work. It's impossible to like this flick. Cruise smiled too much, did his modicum of fighting, flexed his younger muscles, but the flick still fell flat. For much better MI, see 3 or shoot, any other, even 1. Skip this mess - not worth it."

","Despite the convoluted plot, I thoroughly enjoyed the first Mission:Impossible, because it was brisk, it was well made and it was slick. Watching the sequels, I know the second is considered the worst of the series, but while I enjoyed the third film too personally I thought that was the weakest. Mission:Impossible 2 does have a lot of problems, but I didn't find it awful. The plot is less convoluted here, which I appreciated, but what was missing was the brisk efficiency of the first film. The pacing consequently in the first half is very pedestrian and it is only at the half-way mark when it picks up. Also the dialogue is very uneven, sometimes it sparkles sometimes it fizzles. My third and final flaw is Dougray Scott, I have nothing personal against him but his performance as the thief I found very by-the-numbers here. On the plus side, the direction is innovative, the sets, lighting and cinematography are superb, the stunts and special effects are mind-blowing and the music was delightful. And the acting was above decent, with Tom Cruise good in his role, but he is overshadowed by a very fetching Thandie Newton, the ever wonderful Anthony Hopkins and a charismatic Ving Rhames. Overall, decent sequel but the first is better. 7/10 Bethany Cox"

","M:I2 brings back star Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt, returning to his role from the first film Cruise seems a bit more confident this time around, and the direction of John Woo might help a bit.<br/><br/> This time the plot involves a deadly virus that is going to be sold on th black market. Hunt and his team must hunt down the villians and the virus before it is released. <br/><br/> This time around M:I is more on the side of action than a thick and confusing plot. It's not a thinkers movie, it is an action movie. And while Mission Impossible had some great end sequence action, Mission Impossible 2 delivers action the whole way through, with a pleasurable ending.<br/><br/>
 I didn't enjoy M:I very much because I think they either tried to hard or didn't try enough. I found the plot to take too many twists and turns to the point that you didn't really care about the film that much anymore, not because it is confusing but because you do not care about any plot changes, and you just wanted the film to move on and break away from its slow pace. On the other hand M:I2 does the opposite. It moves fast, doesn't have any big twists and turns, and of course with John Woo directing, some very original and interesting fight sequences.<br/><br/> The film itself does have flaws, but you do not really care that much because you are having such a good time enjoying the film. The end has non-stop action, leading to a fist-fight/martial arts sequence on a beach that I will not ruin for you. <br/><br/> The acting team isn't as big in MI:1 but Anthony Hopkins makes a nice cameo as Mission Commander Swanbeck, and Ving Rhames returns as Luther Stickell. The main cast listing follows: Tom Cruise ....  Ethan Hunt Dougray Scott ....  Sean Ambrose Thandie Newton ....  Nyah Nordoff-Hall Ving Rhames ....  Luther Stickell Richard Roxburgh ....  Hugh Stamp John Polson ....  Billy Baird Brendan Gleeson ....  John C. McCloy Rade Serbedzija ....  Dr. Nekhorvich William Mapother ....  Wallis Dominic Purcell ....  Ulrich <br/><br/>  I would recommend this film to you if you like John Woo films, and/or action films. It's got some great action sequences, some good cinematography ( The beginning sequence proves that) and some overall good acting (despite Cruise's big shot attitude) that makes the film a lot better than Mission Impossible 1. <br/><br/>3/5 stars-<br/><br/>JOHN ULMER"

","It's loud and ugly, stupid, sexist, awkward and plotholed to buggery. But Tom Cruise has long hair and I kinda dig it. And his free soloing at the start is pretty rad.
I suppose each Mission film for better and worse is a product of its time, and none more-so than M:I:2. Remember when Dougray Scott was tipped to be as big as Hugh Jackman is now? Unfortunately here his Bond villain hammyness is rote and unappealing.
Did I love this film as a kid? Absolutely. I was a fan of Woo's work in Hard Boiled and Face/Off. I enjoyed this film's pseudo-Bond stylings and it's ludicrous bonkers en vogue virus plot. But it's so painfully dated in literally every way now that's it's only enjoyable in a nostalgic way.
The film is cheesy and nobody does cheesy with as much dedication as Cruise and I do like Anthony Hopkins' slimy IMF contact and the mask bait and switch at the end is particularly sadistic, despite making no sense.
But I suppose the best I can say about this film is that it has such a unique and cocksure voice in Woo that it stands alone and is enjoyable because it's awful.
Impossible Mission: Dropping into the vents of the Biocyte building is a rushed, slipshod shadow of the first film's mission. It's clearly comped in places and pretty slack and undramatic."

","With a curiously similar plotline to Notorious (1946) this sequel offers much action and balletic violence and a familiar John Woo last act set piece. It's overblown, overcooked, and there is much less intrigue compared to the first mission. A descent in a vault has nowhere near as much tension as the first film. That said, Thandie Newton is winsome; Cruise is very capable as the spy trying to thwart a lethal disease outbreak; Dougray Scott is there to ensure the melodrama is maintained."

","The biggest problem here is believable. Instead of having the brains that usually get the IMF Mission done, this one has dumb and impossible stunts. The closing sequences are so terribly done that the movie is laughable. Ethan Hunt becomes a James Bond in this one using luck to get the job done.<br/><br/>The masks used in this are clever but often stupid. Why would anyone believe that someone who is the wrong body size in a mask would be another person? The mask does not change the size of the body the face is one.<br/><br/>The acting in this one of so cliché that it becomes annoying. The plot is predictable, and the stunts are so unlikely, that I am reminded of Los Costello riding roller coaster wheels in front of screens in the later part of Abbott & Costello go to Hollywood, also an MGM film.<br/><br/>The only reason I give this anything at all is that I hate to think I wasted 2 hours on pay cable watching a zero film. It is lucky the later films have gotten better, as this one is the bottom of the barrel literally. They should burn the script on this but keep the film for schools as an example of how not to make a Mission Impossible. There are some nice locations, but they do not make up for a script who IQ is way below other IMF films."
"AmyJenson1995","6","1","2","10 September 2015"," More entertaining but less captivating
","As this movie is a sequel, it would be very hard to not succumb to the temptation of comparing MI2 with the first installment of the series. Personally thinking, I much prefer the first one which was deep and kept me in throughout the story. This one is more raw and gives much less space to brains.<br/><br/>The biggest fault is the plot which is as most basic as we can get. This is all about stunts and shooting. While it's beautifully shot with slow motions and fireworks, leave your brain home because the storyline is inexistent and we already know who are the good and bad guys since the very first scene of the movie. Brian De Palma had the good taste of keeping the suspense to the very end, revealing who was the real bad guys at the very last scenes. But here there is no suspense. We all know how this gonna end. This is a John Woo movie and Brain movies are not really his style. This cost him the 4 points.<br/><br/>But Mr Woo is also an expert on action staging and this is what saved this movie. The action scenes are beautifully shot, a lot of them in slow motion which is one of the pillars of John Woo style. Those make the movie quite enjoyable to see. The pace is high and keeps us entertained. The locations are breathtaking (Grand Canyon, Sevilla and Australia). With John Woo, everything is focused on the visual and MI2 is not an exception to this rule. The casting performance is not that bad either even if Ethan Hunt lost a lot of personality between the two movies.<br/><br/>So here it is. I give it a 6 out of 10 which is not a bad mark but not an excellent one either. I would have wished this movie to be smarter but John Woo sacrificed it for fun which is not a bad idea if you want to enjoy a nice moment at the theater but is if you wish your movie to be remembered."
"willcundallreview","4","1","2","30 August 2015"," Disappointing stuff from this franchise's second outing
","If Tom Cruise can really climb freestyle up a rock face and live to tell the tale, then I want to know how he does that and about twenty other crazy features this movie has to offer. Yes Mission: Impossible is back for a second round and features ridiculous stunts, a kind of storyline more suited to James Bond in the 60's and Tom Cruise going absolutely crazy with the fighting. I didn't like this film and although far from hating it, the movie didn't give me much reason to like it at all, with silly things added in here and there as well, well let's go over it shall we.<br/><br/>First off you have the stunts, done well and the only thing I will fully remember from this movie but also that this has long droughts without any action and then suddenly has too much. Tom Cruise comes back in the same style he has in the first instalment boasting some over the top fight sequences and also longer hair. The story is for me in certain scenes a little too convoluted, now the entire story as a whole isn't but parts are, they defy logic at certain times and some moments are not well explained and really try too hard to draw you in to a plot I just couldn't invest in.<br/><br/>Now what to say about good old John Woo, well to put it in simple terms I really did not enjoy his directing. His style is so insane it just makes normal scenes turn into a crazed stand off and then don't even get me started on the pacing. I can't really say he directs the actors well either and although the cast are fine and all that, his direction can make some scenes just a little dumb and yet again confusing and repetitive. Robert Towne is a legend of screen writing but my word does it look like he has lost it here, I'm not saying this is a career ruin for him not by a long shot but Towne could have done so much better and written something memorable, not just some generic stuff. Staying behind the camera well on the camera maybe is the cinematography which is done well, I liked the nice sweeping shots and angles which change the scene completely, wasn't too sure on the close ups of the face but in general some good stuff. <br/><br/>I think if you're going to make a spy film at least put the action in and spread it out, here it is all concentrated in the same place and so it becomes boring after a while, even with the insane stunts. I think we should have seen more of the suspense that at times the first movie brought to the table, too often in this Cruise or should I say Ethan Hunt just does things at a fast pace with no thrill to it. A better villain as well for me would have been better, sure Dougray Scott and his henchmen could be bad but that true terror I did not see, a poor casting choice all round and should have been easier to absolutely hate. <br/><br/>This film isn't all bad I admit it has it's moments of genius actually and although I think Cruise is not great in this or the first Mission: Impossible, I can't deny he has a lot of spy style. If you liked the first movie then you should have no problems liking this one too, the stunts and the action are enough I felt to satisfy MI fans. For anyone else please be directed to take your brain out before viewing this, it is popcorn movie stuff and I don't think the plot is smart. So overall I do feel this is poor and not really an addition I think Cruise deserves to have in his film catalogue, he is not good here, not bad but not good and I think spy films do not gain anything extra from having this among their ranks."
"schroeder-gustavo","6","1","2","24 July 2015"," Drastic change in tone
","Mission: Impossible is a great spy thriller, the first in the Mission: Impossible series is one I really enjoy, mostly due to the directing and very suspenseful scenes. This brings me to Mission: Impossible II's biggest flaw: It's an entirely different movie than the first one.<br/><br/>This film was directed by John Woo, and it really shows. Watching this movie, you simply have to praise the beautiful shots, the score by Hans Zimmer and the action sequences are very well shot and really exciting. But, simply but, the movie is just dumb. Things like Tom Cruise jumping off a speeding motorcycle against another man and not dying and pretty much all the stunts during that bike sequence make absolutely no sense whatsoever. The movie is eye candy, though. Every scene looks beautiful.<br/><br/>Like I said, the main problem I have with this movie is that it was established in the first Mission: Impossible what kind of character Ethan Hunt is. The man's is a spy who is very focused on his work, always takes that very seriously and, although he is a very charismatic person, he always takes his job very seriously. He's a vulnerable person, as well, not some invincible man who can do a million stunts and take on 100 guys and not die. In this movie, it seems they just tried to make him this old school James Bond, playboy, not worried about anything type of person. Why was he rock climbing in the beginning of the movie? To show a cool shot of Tom Cruise rock climbing with no ropes, of course. After having established who the character of Ethan Hunt was going to be, this movie just takes all the good things about the original and just craps on them.<br/><br/>Overall, I can still find some enjoyment in Mission: Impossible II, but the movie works a lot better if just viewed as a straight-up John Woo shoot-em up action movie than a Mission: Impossible movie. Not a strong entry in the series, this one can be skipped."

","In the fifteen years since its release I hadn't found any good reason to revisit John Woo's 'Mission: Impossible II'. Today I found a reason, if not a good one; boredom.

You would think that the involvement of John Woo would at least guarantee some fun action sequences, but even those fail to ignite any interest.<br/><br/>I can't say agent Ethan Hunt's mission here is impossible, but it certainly is incoherent, interminable, and inconsequential."
"Rickting","4","1","2","30 December 2014"," Noisy nonsense which isn't enough fun
","I love action movies, but I need a plot to enjoy them properly. Mission Impossible II has little plot. It's something to do with Tom Cruise's superspy trying to destroy an engineered virus. Aside from a romance sub plot there's little other plot. Mission Impossible was a boring spy thriller with a convoluted plot, but the sequel is even worse. Watching MI2 was a very detached experience. There's nothing to invest yourself in or latch onto in this movie. It's just loads of action set pieces with no plot or characters. Tom Cruise is incredibly boring and his character can do anything, so therefore isn't interesting at all. The action itself peaks early on with an impressive rock climbing sequence. From then on, the set pieces are highly artificial and often don't make any sense. Dramatically listless, blank and devoid of a human touch, MI2 is a film watching experience that has absolutely no impact whatsoever and hits about as hard as a soft feather pillow to the face.<br/><br/>The film is admittedly well made and it's certainly not unwatchable, but it's difficult to pay attention to it. John Woo remains an accomplished and skilled director of action, but the action in this movie doesn't always suit him. He's better at shootouts and the car chases feel fairly ordinary. The film is trying its best and its target audience will mostly love it. The film requires a certain mood to be able to appreciate it, and cynical viewers may just switch it off out of boredom. A well made action film with plenty of visual splendour, but it comes up short on the screen writing front. Mission Impossible 4 was a good action film but that was because it actually had a plot and there were stakes. At least you could understand what was going on. Here, it's just noisy incoherence. The first MI movie failed because it spent too much time on boring dialogue and not enough action. Here, there's plenty of action but it doesn't deliver. It's difficult to get action films right when the lead is a zombie with muscles. I'm not too hyped about Mission Impossible 5.<br/><br/>4/10"

Tom Cruise and Thandie Newton have reasonable chemistry. The problem is that director John Woo takes a long time to get going. It spends so much unnecessary time with the couple and then explaining the story. There is the usual John Woo action touches. It's just way too slow. Thandie has so little energy in her performance and John Woo doesn't have enough big meaningful action scenes. There is still some good action going on especially that bike chase.

He also has great talent at delivering unforgettable lines (""Just stay alive!"" and ""I'm not gonna lose you!"" were especial favorites of mine and very thought-provoking) and incredible skills at martial arts (refer to the impeccable fistfight scene at the end).<br/><br/>Along with these awesome additions, we get multiple bad guys! Multiple explosions! An unlimited supply of rubber masks utilized over and over again! Absolutely useless cameos by doves! <br/><br/>Honestly, it was just an overdrawn mess. The movie lasted about 40 minutes too long, and by the time you brought all of the slo-mo scenes to regular speed, that 40 minutes would easily be spared and we could return to a Chimera-free lifestyle more quickly. The characters (or lack thereof) furthered the borefest. Luther seemed to be recuperating (perhaps from reading the dull script), and this new no-name sidekick had about as much personality as a sack of potatoes. Nyah started out as your typical ""mysterious"" character and ended as your typical ""implausible"" character, all but whimpering at the edge of a cliff as the countdown to the virus' infection of her wound to, yes, the near end. But don't worry! They'll save her, as this film is nothing short of predictable. The villain(s) were just forgettable.<br/><br/>It's a great difficulty to stop the spread of Chimera?

","Let me start by saying I enjoyed this movie. As my summary suggests, it serves it purpose as being a mindless summer action movie for people to enjoy. Therefore I watched this in the mindset of wanting to be entertained. Not educated.<br/><br/>And y'now what? I was thoroughly entertained.<br/><br/>First of all, the plot is Cliché no.4, a virus is created and has to be stopped. So nothing original so far. It does provide a basic premise that is easy for many cinemas goers can understand. It depends on your point of view whether this is a wise move or not, but as I've mentioned, people just want action from a movie such as this.<br/><br/>The characters serve their purpose but add little depth to their motives or actions. They just seem to do things. We are given some back story into some of the characters but it is not conveyed very effectively. For example, Thandie Newton's character is supposedly a thief with no conscience. This is ""effectively"" portrayed by her driving recklessly and generally pouting. But never does she try and gain advantage of her situation (like a thief would). Why not pocket a bit of that cash for yourself? The camera work and special effects are Woo trademarks in this movie. Especially in regard to the slow motion shots with unnecessary amounts of emotion thrown over like sprinkles.<br/><br/>Overall, I would say this movie was always destined to receive the reviews it did. With similar regard to it's box office totals. It was a summer movie action movie staring Tom Cruise which was a sequel of a much loved 1996 spy movie. What could you expect? This movie was never going to undercut The Godfather or Citizen Kane, but it was supposed to make a lot of money. And that it did, and probably entertained a lot of people along the way. It certainly started the 2000's of to a good start in terms of action.<br/><br/>So what the hell. Stick your mind in neutral for an hour and a half and enjoy Mission Impossible 2."

I have never been a big fan of John Woo's,I often find many of his films to be overblown,and unexciting,in fact the only film I've liked of his,is Face Off. Mission Impossible II is no different. It's overly loud,brash and not sophisticated like the 1st one was. Mission Impossible managed to thrill us,with perfectly orchestrated suspense,here it turns into an action lovers feast. There're shootouts,Tom and Dougray wrestling around on motorcycles,Tom avoiding bullets,unfortunately it's all highly unrealistic looking,and took away a lot of enjoyment for me. The fight scene near the end though,is shockingly well done. Tom showed quite the acrobatic skills,despite no Martial Arts training what so ever,it was all done to perfection. I also enjoyed how Thandie Newton's character was developed. She's completely unpredictable as Nyah|A bit too much at times,if you asked me| mysterious,we never know where she truly stands until the halfway point.<br/><br/>Mission Impossible II entertains at some points,but it's just much too stupid for it's own good,completely brainless stuff.<br/><br/>Performances. Tom Cruise's charisma is able to make this film a lot better then it should be. He is the epitome of cool here,walking around with a black leather jacket,expensive sunglasses,his hair all done up,he looks like a bad ass. Ethan Doesen't have the depth that he does in the 1st film,and this completely hurts Tom In the long run. Tom,however is able to bring his own brand of acting to Ethan this time around,to give us a character we can root for. His chemistry with Newton was also on the money. Thandie Newton is certainly good looking,that's for sure. As far as her acting is concerned,she managed to do a pretty adequate job,making her character as unpredictable as it comes. Dougray Scott is a decent villain. He's somewhat bland,but managed to get the job done when it counted. Ving Rhames is too cool for school. He added class,just like he did in the 1st. Richard Roxburgh is decent as Stamp,I liked his style for the most part. John Polson is funny as the other team member,basically the comic relief though. Brendan Gleeson is decent in his shady written part. Rade Serbedzija has a memorable accent,I'll say that.<br/><br/>Bottom Line. Mission Impossible II is a failure as far as a followup goes. On it's own it's a mildly entertaining sequel at best,I'll say it again,having John Woo at the helm was a big mistake. Worth a look,but don't expect the original,and you might wanna bring some aspirin with you,due to the utter stupidity of the plot sometimes.<br/><br/>6/10"
"Brawl_666","6","1","2","26 November 2009"," Woo takes it up the --- from Cruise
","Powerfully lousy film-making. Lets see now, most good action films justify the pretext for the ensuing violence very well. Or they have some decent drama & emotion to prop up the action. Die Hard, T2, Speed, Point Break, The Rock are some examples that follow this basic template the best. And as such these are great, if empty, pieces of entertainment. You don't HAVE to be a teenager to enjoy these films.<br/><br/>This film essentially has no organizing principle whatsoever. Cruise has hijacked the entire production. His ""ghost-direction"" is painfully obvious and proves to be the death knell for the film (and Woo). The whole thing is in thrall to his infantile pretty-boy narcissism (ugh!). The man STILL cant get over his looks. Cruise is *not* an authentic human being with genuine emotional response. You'll notice he has this weird thing going on in his films where his real life & thoughts creepily show up in whatever role he may be doing at the moment (Jerry Maguire, this, MI-3). And it usually has to do with his attitude to women. He turns into this psycho creep around them. His scenes in 'Lions for Lambs' with Meryl Streep made my skin curl. Oh, the horror.<br/><br/>No more unkind words are left to heap on the hideous Mr. Tom Cruise. He's a madman, we all know that. You, dear reader, may be wondering why I'm wasting my time on such a wearying dud. I read Roger Ebert's review after watching this film last night, and it made me re-evaluate my perception of the man. The only way to make sense of that review of his is to look at it as some kind of Kaufmann-esqe parody where he's laughing at the viewer/reader. He uses some obfuscating, post-doctoral Derrida-speak to describe what is quite obviously a very bad movie. Surprisingly, for once IMDb gives this a pretty sane (though still very high) rating of 5.6/10.<br/><br/>Marketing blitzkrieg saved this stillborn project. No wonder Paramount got fed up of Cruise. The guy is an egomaniac, and a no-talent to boot."
"waddayanuts","6","1","2","13 August 2009"," How can people hate a film that has got bouncing sand?
","It seems that everyone on the Mission Impossible II board hates the film for all the John Woo stuff, and everyone on the John Woo board hates it for being Hollywood and not enough John Woo. Isn't that sad? Hopefully, I will eventually find someone who likes it as much as I do.<br/><br/>I grew up with this film, and I loved it as a kid. When I rewatched it a couple of years ago, I realized how crappy the plot is and how silly some of the scenes are. At first, I was a bit disappointed, since I'd always thought of it as a very good film, but then it started to amuse me. Today, I think it's a lot of fun for the same reasons for which I love the fridge scene in Indy 4.<br/><br/>I guess the main reason why people don't like this film is because they take it too seriously. They complain about the weak plot, the lame characters and all the things that don't make sense. But the plot is irrelevant in a movie like this. John Woo handed some action scenes to screenwriter Robert Towne, and he developed a plot around them. So forget about the plot, which is just Notorious combined with De Palma's ""Deus ex machina"" masks, and instead focus on some of the hilarious, nonsensical John Woo action scenes.<br/><br/>First of all there's the great opening with Cruise hanging from a high cliff without any ropes. And the nicely unnecessary car chase whose only purpose seems to be to destroy some expensive sports cars. Then there is the entire last act, which is a chaotic montage of unrealistic, staged action. It's just John Woo having fun with all his Hollywood gear. Firstly, you've got Tom Cruise attacking blind guards, who ought to have seen him miles away. Then he's using his motorcycle as a shield while skating the asphalt. At one point Woo has even inserted a medieval duel on motorcycles.<br/><br/>The best thing, though, is when Ambrose pulls a ""Die Hard"" and suddenly turns out to still be alive and points a gun at our unarmed hero. Now, what do you do in that helpless situation? Of course, you notice a gun at your feet, turn around, while you kick in the sand so the gun bounces up in the air, you catch it and shoot the enemy. All done in such a fast and sudden motion that Ambrose doesn't have time to react on it. Isn't that beautiful?<br/><br/>8/10. Even by the standards of the action genre, this film makes little sense. But then again, this franchise is called Mission Impossible, and is actually about what all action films are about: Impossibiliy made possible. It's just an incoherent mix of a lot of impossible, but funny situations."

","I was tempted to check the ""Contains spoiler"" box before writing my comment, reason being that if you ever watched Alfred Hitchcock's ""Notorious"", you have already watched this movie. Well, to be fair, there's the face-switching and explosions and inferior acting to the previously mentioned masterpiece that make Mission: Impossible 2 a little different. I don't know if any lawsuits were brought up during the release of this film, but they should've been for the cheapening of a Cary Grant classic. I would think that a sequel to such a ""notorious"" action film would have just a little more originality. Had the plot not have been already used, the score would be a 6/10. The action was a little fun, and the face-switching never gets old. But with the knowledge that this movie is a blatant rip-off, the experience is a little depressing. For those not into black-and-white oldies, sorry for ruining your fun."
"VagueVoice","7","1","2","8 April 2008"," Good action film!
","I remember going go the cinema to watch MI2 and being quite pleasantly surprised! I was younger at the time, being maybe 16/17 and my desire for an intellectual driven plot was not particularly well formed as yet. But I think this was the film that made the transition for me, having a good story which was reasonably straightforward to understand and breathtaking action sequences (at the time) with 3 good actors that worked really well together.<br/><br/>I've noticed that many of the comments here for this film are pretty negative, and, I suppose, can understand why. In retrospect it is just your typical Hollywood, big-budget movie attempting to cash-in on an already successful franchise, but at the the same time, I don't think there's anything wrong with that. If it was a bad movie then obviously I'd think differently, but it's not at all! The cinematography in this movie is very well put together and the soundtrack score works really well also. In effect this all adds to a really good sense of atmosphere, portraying the classic good (Hunt) and evil (Ambrose). This is all held together by Nyah Nordoff Hall (Thandie Newton), an ex-girlfriend of Ambrose's and a new love interest for Hunt, which I'd say holds up pretty well. The action sequences are well put together, from the scenes in Utah with Cruise free-climbing a Mesa, the Biocyte skyscraper scene, to the Bare island scene..all well done I think.<br/><br/>Overall MI2 is an easy watching movie. If your going to take it seriously as a film then your going to be disappointed but if you like your action movies and Tom Cruise then you'll enjoy it. First film is better but it works well as a new genre to the Mission Impossible series."

","Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is back, and this time John Woo is in the directors chair, which can only mean one thing.<br/><br/>Mission Impossible II still keeps some of the spy feel found in the first incarnation, but this time its interlaced with some brilliant action sequences and some original stunts sequences that are great fun to watch. I think what impressed me most about this film was the fight sequence near the end, it really did seem very realistic considering the training and background of the characters involved.<br/><br/>To carry the action along, a good storyline is introduced, that is both compelling and clever enough to keep our interest throughout.<br/><br/>With a few old faces and the introduction of Thandie Newton and Dougray Scott, the cast is again pretty solid; all in all this second incarnation bears almost no resemblance to the original series, yet it still entertains purely as an action picture with some substance.<br/><br/>I found it to be a thrilling ride, and i enjoyed it more than the first film 8/10"
"iamolc","2","1","2","25 August 2007"," Pity the Middle Child
","It's been said that the middle child often has more adjustment problems than the other two. In film trilogies, even unintended ones like I suspect the MI franchise of being, the middle film often falls short of either the first or the last. A classic example is Back to the Future II, which was as dark and repellent as I and III were attractive and whimsical.<br/><br/>MI:II is the film to avoid in this trilogy. MI was intriguing in its exploration of the classic film question ""What if?"" What if Jim Phelps had tired of always being the underpaid civil servant and gone for the gold? Brian De Palma develops his answer in a wonderfully nuanced and compelling way. The scene in which a resurrected Jim tries to film-flam Ethan Hunt is delightful. As Jim describes Kittridge, the alleged force behind all the violence, as tiring of his 60K yearly salary, his rotten marriage, and his obsolescence, Ethan realizes Jim is describing himself and everything falls into place. The later chase aboard the TGV is almost believable.<br/><br/>Hardly anything is believable in MI:II. Worse than that, the plot is derivative in the extreme. Besides recapitulating Hitchcock's Notorious, director Woo draws on Star Trek for the opening scene in Moab.....Terminator II for the shootout in the Biocyte lab.....Star Trek again for the infected person who needs the antidote.....Terminator II again for Luther blowing up cars with huge cannon shells. The love triangle is an old one that wastes Thandi Newton's considerable talent. The motorcycle chase near the end reinforces the too-widely held perception that all riders are psychotic yahoos.<br/><br/>Still, the film is OK for what it is: A third-rate shoot-em-up. The photography of Australia isn't bad, either."

It was also better as it had a slightly better cast with returnees Tom Cruise and Ving Rhames but also new additions such as Dougray Scott as the villain,Sean Ambrose,Thandie Newton as the cunning thief,Nyah Hall, and countless others as I knew this cast better than the previous Mission Impossible's cast. Another reason was that this time, it was a race against the clock type action movie with heart pounding moments such as the rubber mask getting ripped off a dead guy only to find out that it isn't who you wanted dead,etc. Altogether,it was an above average action movie."

","Don't get me wrong, years and years ago when I seen the trailer for this...I thought, John woo directing this is awesome; then I saw this movie and from my impression not only I felt really insulted but also cheated at the fact that Mr. Woo added pretty much everything INCLUDING the kitchen sink to explode on impact with merely one bullet and some flashy moves. No disrespect to the director he really is good at his game....when he was doing old school Hong Kong flicks like hard boiled! <br/><br/>Mission Impossible 2 (aka Mi: 2) was the long awaited and anticipated sequel to the 1996 sleeper blockbuster and based off the highly successful TV show also with the same name. But in all honestly, this movie didn't raise the bar it just made it worse and nearly almost screwed up this franchise if it wasn't for J.J. Abrams smart approach to the third installment. Tom Cruise returns as the now almost superhuman Ethan hunt who pretty much makes it clear that bullets can't touch him, he can scale mountains with his bare hands, perform flashy martial arts, and have time to woo the girl with his charms damn I'm surprise he's not playing the saxophone and surfing the stair rails blindfolded while shooting the bad guys left and right....wait a minute...I think he did do that!! The storyline is weak but simple, You see there's a virus that is capable of wiping out humanity and they gave it a code name: Chimera (oooh Greek roman history lesson somewhere) but in other to fight against this virus a anti-virus was created code name: Balerafont (cause even in viruses there are good verses evil battles!) so of course there's a race against time and they eventually needed someone who can get the job done but unfortunately superman/Ethan was climbing mountains with bare hands and another partner a sexy thief by the name of Nya (Thandie Newton)..oh yeah I forgot his team of Luther and Billy Barty (did I mention that both characters are hardly seen as much in this movie) and who can bring these guys together than Hannibal himself (Anthony Hopkins) which I think the was only there cause they must of paid him a lot but the look on his face said he was pretty much bored in this film but you be the judge on that.<br/><br/>Lets face it the story was sub par bad (due to bad and lack of script), the romantic kindling between Tom and Thandie's character was VERY much rushed and obviously typical to the movie goer, and the bad guys were pretty much whinny little babies that can't shoot straight for the life of them but yet Ethan aka. The batman can hide in the shadows make, one shot an explosive one every damn time, can pop wheelies and burn rubber on the side with his feet while riding a motorcycle at very high speeds...did I mention he can cook too!? John Woo's approach wasn't bent on intellect like the first one and third, you can see him trying but it failed in many areas I mean DAMN even Luther (Ving rhames) didn't get that much screen time it was like Woo was saying, ""screw the black man, I want super white guy flashing his pretty hair every chance he gets"" I mean its not like woo hasn't done that before (The big hit and pretty much ALL his Americanized movies). The action scenes were pretty much IMPOSSIBLE I seen tom pretty much risk his ass in ridiculous moments in this movie it made me wonder, ""I wish I can do that!!"" but then was hit with reality and physics. This movie is pretty much a stuntman's dream with the white dove even at the climax I felt really cheated being that I could of sworn I've seen the dual shootout before (face/off) I could say more to why I didn't like this movie but I'm going to watch Mi: 3 on DVD now and be reminded on what could of been done to part 2."

","Another John Woo piece of crap. All this movie is action and no substance, the first Mission Impossible was good, with a great plot and a nice twist at the end. This movie is all about seeing how many explosions could be used in a high budget film. The stunts are totally ridiculous and illogical. Like all of John Woo movies this is a over funded pile of explosions, bad wire tricks, and improbable events. The plot is straight forward and linear and the twist where Ambrose shoots his own friend was, in my mind, completely stupid. As you may have guessed I hated this film which is unfortunate because of how much I liked the first one."

The good story and tricky agent conspiracy has been replaced with smart looking action, crazy stunts, too many smart one liners and no personality? Tom Cruise has changed from a serious agent to a smart bad ass agent, who only shows ""I can kick some ass"" and ""I can kick some more ass"". The action is looking good, but it has no personality; something happens all the time, and nothing happens.<br/><br/>M:I-2 is a MAJOR disappointment comparing to Brian De Palmes GREAT first film.

That's about 20 minutes! It was also quite startling and disturbing, so don't let any young children see this movie! Not only is this the worst of the series (but still pretty good), but it is also the most violent. There is a lot of intense chase scenes and sequences of punching and fighting and stabbing and rolling around and gunshots.

"JamesHitchcock","4","1","2","28 June 2006"," The George Lazenby of the Twenty-First Century
","""Mission Impossible 2"" borrows many of the traditional elements of the trusted formula which proved so successful in the James Bond series. There is a secret agent hero, a psychopathic villain bent on world domination, a beautiful heroine, exotic locations (Seville and Sydney), a ""McGuffin"" which the hero and villain are trying to get hold of and the obligatory car chases. The hero is Ethan Hunt, an operative for a highly secretive US government agency. The villain is Sean Ambrose, a renegade member of the same organisation and the heroine is Nyah Nordoff-Hall, a professional thief and (in a typical Bond-like touch) Ambrose's former girlfriend. The McGuffin is a lethal virus developed by a corrupt pharmaceuticals tycoon and which Ambrose is trying to steal along with the antidote so that he can hold the world to ransom. Although the hero is an American, the villain, heroine and Hunt's boss (equivalent to Bond's ""M"") are all British; Nyah, despite her exotic name and looks, speaks in the tones of an English public schoolgirl. Nyah and Hunt become romantically involved; a rare example of an inter-racial romance in an American film. <br/><br/>The film, however, lacks certain essential ingredients of the Bond formula. The Bond films, at their most stylish, are distinguished by a lightness of touch and a careful balance between excitement and humour. ""Mission Impossible 2"", however, takes itself completely seriously and has very little humour. Connery, Moore, Dalton and Brosnan all interpreted James Bond in their own ways, but he always emerged as a rounded, believable character with his own personality. Tom Cruise's Hunt, by contrast, comes across as devoid of personality, comparable only with Bond as interpreted by the inert George Lazenby. Dougray Scott does his best with Ambrose, but he does not emerge as a particularly memorable villain in the Bond tradition. Thandie Newton, who was so impressive in films like ""Flirting"" and ""Jefferson in Paris"", seems wasted as Nyah.<br/><br/>This is the only one of the ""Mission Impossible"" films that I have seen, and it has not inspired me to go to the video store to rent the original or to the cinema to see the recent ""Mission Impossible 3"". It has confirmed some of the doubts I had about Tom Cruise. In his early ""Top Gun"" or ""Cocktail"" period he seemed a handsome but shallow matinée idol but then matured into a very good actor in intelligent films like ""Rain Man"", ""Born on the Fourth of July"", ""A Few Good Men"" and ""Eyes Wide Shut"". Unfortunately, he has also shown a tendency to act in some ill-advised vanity projects, often with himself as producer, and these have rarely shown him at his best. Thus we had the interminably dull ""Far and Away"", the virtually incomprehensible ""Vanilla Sky"" and ""The Last Samurai"". This last was not my favourite film, largely because of Cruise's overacting and its regrettable and historically ignorant tendency to glamorise Japanese militarism, but at least making an epic set in the Japan of the 1870s showed a laudable ambition to go beyond Hollywood's normal range.<br/><br/>""Mission Impossible 2"", by contrast, shows no ambition at all; it is just a bog-standard shoot-em-up action adventure of the sort that Hollywood's lesser talents can make with their eyes closed. If Mr Cruise must indulge himself in vanity productions, he should find something worthier of his talents than trying to become another Schwarzenegger or Segal. He should certainly set his sights higher than becoming the George Lazenby of the twenty-first century. 4/10"

He still doesn't have an Oscar (you mean the crying sequence in Top Gun wasn't good enough) and he's never been asked to play James Bond! Of course Cruise isn't English, which makes it difficult to consider him for the role, but if Cruise was the last English applicant left I am sure Brocoli would just shut the project down.<br/><br/>This movie is just stupid. It is a total yawner. It has no brains. Most likely because the people who made it don't have any. And that includes the star. All he's trying to do is be James Bond. He can't get the role so he wants to show everyone he's better than 007. Hey that's going to work - not! In the first film they totally ruined the premise of the original series. They start out by deliberately sabotaging it so the screen writers can just pour out all this drivel. Hey that was great. Now they take the little intelligence left in the first one and get rid of it altogether.<br/><br/>How about a new Rocky movie where Sly absolutely demolishes Cruise in the ring? Everyone would love that.<br/><br/>Check the trivia section for this movie if you want another clue how brainless this is: the screen writer was directed to weave a plot through action scenes John Poo already decided on. This is even worse than Spielberg.<br/><br/>The trivia section also says the movie was smuggled to theatres with the fictitious name 'Doll House'. That seems much more appropriate. Maybe Tom Cruise could take up Ibsen as a hobby. When he's finally gratefully out of work. And before he flies off with the thetans again.<br/><br/>Total loser. 1 is too high a vote. 0 would still be too high. Demand the theatre refund your money.

MI:2 is what its meant to be a love story, a spy movie, and an action bonanza. John Woo is the king of setting up action and then executing it right on point. He also does a nice job using Flaminco dancing as a beat to a key seen.

I half-expected a dumb Hollywood remake with some obscure references to a TV show I have never seen, but what I got was a semi-intelligent entertaining and spy movie with quite a few twists and surprises.<br/><br/>I was actually quite eager to see the sequel. When I heard John Woo was directing MI2, I thought - great, instead of a good spy/action movie I will get a slow-mo fest with car wrecks and pigeons. Was I right? Unfortunately, one hundred percent.<br/><br/>MI2 looks and feels like a 2-hour recording of a video game. Pretty people (people in question mainly being Cruise and his love interest) run, drive, shoot and generally do acrobatic things, almost half the time in slow motion. There is a generic action movie plot (villain steals thing X to do a dastardly thing Y and our hero has to stop him while THE CLOCK IS TICKING) right out of a B-action movie starring Steven Seagal or Michael Dudikoff, or an episode of Action Man cartoon series. No real team-based action, no spy angle, nothing. Just Cruise selling his hairspray commercial smile before doing some acrobatic stunt which should kill an average men ten times over.<br/><br/>The flick really goes for the lowest possible denominator. No effort is spent into putting some logic or thought into the plot. The ""rubber mask"" shtick is so overused it is painful to watch. The action scenes never end, bullets, crashes and explosions are non-stop, yet the main characters never even get bruised. I could proceed but you get the point - this is a dumb formulaic action movie that uses every cliché in the book and isn't even entertaining.<br/><br/>John Woo is a director with one trick up his sleeve and is seriously overusing his welcome. Tom Cruise obviously just wants us to watch his pretty face. Together they created a movie that is hardly worth seeing it for free, let alone paying for it.<br/><br/>3/10"

While it's true I've never seen any of Woo's work from his early days which is touted as action art but I have seen Windtalkers, Paycheck, Face/Off, Broken Arrow and of course Mission Impossible 2. Woo brings to the table an incredible unique style...TOO unique. He has to make everything with John Woo stamped all over it and tries to make action...art and it's not!! Action is action...it's adrenalin pumping, edge of your seat, holler for the hero...you don't care whether their movements and choreography is beautiful and in the process of making this unique piece of art John Woo lost the magic that was Mission Impossible.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise returns as nice guy secret agent, with a bit more of an edge, Ethan Hunt. Hunt definitely is tougher, grittier and yet falls deeply in love in this Mission. He still plays the role well and no one fulfills the screen presence like Cruise. The hair was wild!! Almost unexplainable?? The long, greasy locks was not very becoming and certainly cut back on the clean cut Ethan Hunt we knew from the original. Although tougher and grittier it just felt like his character wasn't as smart and throughout all the wild stunts and fights which are practically 100% done in slow motion, he loses something in his character. Dougray Scott takes the helm as the bad guy, Sean Ambrose. Instead of being Ethan's mentor, this time he is his stand in for many missions and he's tired of being in the shadow. Scott is decent and plays the bad guy well but in all honestly he doesn't stand a chance against Cruise. He never poses a viable threat and you just sit back and wait for him to get his butt kicked. Thandie Newton plays the Mission Impossible girl, Nyah Nordoff-Hall. Ethan falls madly in love with her at first sight, completely out of the blue and then must protect her as she goes deep undercover with her former lover Sean Ambrose. Despite horrible reviews Newton is not AWFUL...she's a million miles from great but she's okay. Her and Cruise have some strong sexual tension but otherwise the romantic chemistry is fleeting. She's kind of whiny and annoying for someone who is supposed to be a strong female and a brilliant thief. Ving Rhames returns as Hunt's partner Luther Stickell and his role is a little bigger this time around which is a welcome addition. He adds to the cast nicely. Richard Roxburgh plays Hench man and bad guy Hugh Stamp. His role is pretty quiet but effective and in fact he might have made a better major villain than Dougray Scott. His suspicious nature and his brutal facial expressions are fun to watch and even though Scott does get the better of him several times it's not believable and you keep waiting for Roxburgh to take him out. And finally giving Mission Impossible that touch of experience and class that Jon Voight and Vanessa Redgrave did to the original is Anthony Hopkins as Hunt's boss. Despite being a relatively small role he has some very effective and memorable lines. ""To lie to a man and sleep with him, she's a woman, she has all the training she needs."" ""This is not Mission Difficult Mr. Hunt, it's Mission Impossible, difficult should be a walk in the park for you."" It's unfortunate he didn't have a bigger role.<br/><br/>Parts of Mission Impossible were kept in tact in order to make it as good as the original but in my humble movie going opinion it was the decision of bringing director John Woo on board that made the film nearly a joke. Fortunately with such strong actors, and some decent action scenes the film was pulled from obscurity but just barely. What should have and could have been one of the best fights in action film history between Ethan Hunt and Sean Ambrose in the end turned into some sort of choreographed dance routine done in slow motion with flowing clothing and hair and some sort of half-assed wrestling maneuvers that looked like it hurt them more than the other guy they were doing it too. The idea of a virus being stole was good and also opened up the window for a near replay of Hunt's daring theft in the original and although it wasn't bad as Hunt narrowly dives down into fan shafts, it just didn't come across as well. Mission Impossible II is okay and it's worth seeing if not just because the first was so incredible and hopefully the third will put this series back on track but so far number II definitely falls short of what the original was. The action is less, the romance is overwhelming and a little hokey, the fight scenes are far too dance like and the plot is still a little muddled and you wonder often what's going on. Add into that the cast just wasn't as strong as the original and you have a sub par sequel. Good luck next time!! 6.5/10"
"SmoothCriminal8291958","10","1","2","10 April 2006"," Just As Good As The First For Entirely Different Reasons.
","""Mission: Impossible II"" is the polar opposite and entirely different animal of its 1996 predecessor. The production team of Tom Cruise/ Paula Wagner wanted to take the billion-dollar film franchise in a different direction. They wanted to correct the misalignments of the first film. Although likable, many people criticized the first film of being overly complex and confusing. So, the production team compensated by hiring a foreign action director from Hong Kong in John Woo to take the series in a new direction and to chart into a new frontier. They dump one of the two screenwriters, David Koepp, and keep the other Academy-Award winning one, Robert Towne, to helm the script. The result is an action film released in 2000 that grossed more than its predecessor. The first film was overly complex; its sequel is overly simple. The first film relied on intrigue, mystery, and CGI enhanced effects to deliver the goods, while its sequel utilized action/adventure and death-defying stunts instead to remain as equal as its predecessor. Instead of bashing ""M: I-II,"" instead I ask that everybody keeps an open mind and take a look at the grand scheme of things regarding the two films.<br/><br/>What I like in particular is the fact that the two movies serve as complete opposites. Tom Cruise did not want to serve up the same movie twice, so he created an entirely different one, even if it does not confine to the original framework of its predecessor and TV series.<br/><br/>""Mission: Impossible II"" is a seriously underrated film, although it does not confine to the original concept of the 1966 television series, or its film predecessor four years previous, Cruise still nonetheless should have garnered his fourth Academy Award nomination. I'm now going to make the stretch in stating if indeed, Cruise received a nomination for this role, he probably would have beat out favorite Russell Crowe for ""Gladiator."" He had to deal with emotionally, complex material from a incredibly underrated script by Robert Towne, who won an Academy Award for the ""Best Original Screenplay"" in 1975 for his script to the Jack Nicholson film, ""Chinatown."" Just because ""Mission: Impossible II"" is an action movie, does not automatically necessarily mean it's a bad film. You cannot dismiss it so easily, because it's like what Towne said so accurately about the film-making style of director John Woo: ""It's like Yeats, the famous poet, said, 'a terrible beauty.'"" All of John Woo's films have a certain type of unrelenting violence, in a similar fashion that director Martin Scorsese has, in his films that the viewer cannot resist but to watch. Now granted, ""M I: II"" is not the perfect film, and it is not without flaws. The overkill use of John Woo's slow motion techniques can be sometimes ""lame,"" but ultimately Tom Cruise single-handedly elevates the status of the film.<br/><br/>People need to stop bashing Tom Cruise. I'm not saying that he's the most perfect human being/actor in the world today of famous celebrities, but nonetheless, he still undeniably has tremendous talent. When you analyze the range of his films, the range of acting for this actor is incredible. For people to bash Cruise without prior establishment of any solid foundations, makes the accuser(s) seem completely idiotic. Cruise is the consummate actor. You don't have three Academy Award nominations for being a *beep* actor, and he potentially could have won all three awards if not for the performances of Daniel Day Lewis, ""My Left Foot,"" (1989), Geoffrey Rush for ""Shine,"" (1996) and in the supporting acting role for Michael Caine in ""The Cider House Rules"" (1999).<br/><br/>There aren't a lot of actors who are willing to take the physical beatings, do all of their own stunts, and act with the conviction necessary to carry the entire weight of the success or failure of the film. If you don't believe take a look at the previous winners in the Academy Award category for this decade alone. Russell Crowe (2000), Denzel Washington (2001), Adrien Brody (2002), Sean Penn (2003), Jamie Foxx (2004), and Phillip Seymour Hoffman (2005). Now granted, all of these preceding actors are extremely talented actors and deserving of all the success that they have been fortunate to receive w/in the past years, but none of them go through the complicated, time-consuming process of truly delving into the characters portrayed in the films that Tom Cruise evidently has done so in the past. Don't believe me? Think I'm talking out of my ass? Then, analyze ""The Color of Money,"" (1986) ""Rain Man,"" (1988) ""Born on the Fourth of July,"" (1989) ""A Few Good Men"" (1992), ""The Firm,"" (1993) ""Interview With the Vampire"" (1994) ""Jerry Maguire,"" (1996) ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" (1999) ""Magnolia"" (1999) ""Vanilla Sky,"" (2001) ""Minority Report,"" (2002) ""The Last Samurai,"" (2003) or ""Collateral"" (2004). Every actor has their off days so forget ""Cocktail,"" (1988) ""Far and Away"" (1992). Here's an actor who held his own against fellow Hollywood Heavyweights in Paul Newman, Dustin Hoffman, Gene Hackman, Jack Nicholson, Brad Pitt, Cuba Gooding Jr., Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Max von Sydow, Ken Watanabe, and Jamie Foxx.<br/><br/>To the people who say that Tom Cruise is a ""not-so-talented"" actor who steals roles from other talented actors, let me remind you that Cruise has used his business savvy and ambition to work with talented directors such as Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, Stanley Kubrick, Ed Zwick, Sydney Pollack, Brian De Palma, John Woo, Tony Scott, Ridley Scott, Berry Levinson, Oliver Stone, Michael Mann, Cameron Crow, Rob Reiner, Paul Thomas Anderson, and Neil Jordan. You don't establish a track record like this for working with any of the preceding directors: Tom Cruise has worked with all of them. If Tom Cruise is such a bad actor, then why have his last seven consecutive films dating all the back to 1999, opened at number one at the box office in the United States (which is difficult, given the fact that box office numbers have recently slumped)?"

","The original mission impossible was a serious movie. There was the occasional joke written into the script, but the whole time it was a serious mystery. M:I 2 had some redeeming qualities, like good action in spots. It did have serious moments, but it was much more light hearted than the first and I guess that is what ruined it for me. It is worth watching and still somewhat enjoyable, but done in a different style than the first. Not a terrible movie, but it lost what was most desirable to me about the first one, which was the serious tone throughout the whole movie. Some of the ideas in this movie were also somewhat ridiculous. It was more over the top cool action than it was really slick action."

Why would anyone slow-mo a car wreck? We don't need to see Ethan Hunt toss around his hair like that guy on Shrek 2, do we? No. We want action. We want the Ethan Hunt on the first movie. The one who runs, screams on the telephone, and doesn't have such a serious relationship. If we wanted to watch a movie with so much love in it (it practically revolves around it), we would've watched Pretty Woman or something. This movie is supposed to have action--but where? Only at the end? I liked the bad guys more in this movie--at least they knew it was supposed to be action.<br/><br/>This movie makes me tired just to speak about it.<br/><br/>If you want a sleeping pill, go watch this movie.

"fertilecelluloid","2","1","2","14 February 2006"," John Woo miscast once again
","Since arriving in America, John Woo has been miscast in every project. He managed to turn ""Face/Off"" around by rejecting the futuristic aspects and focusing on the relationship between Cage and Travolta. It is his best US film so far, but that's not saying much. ""Mission Impossible 2"" is way beyond awful and should have killed the series. It didn't. Woo forces his signature traits between the sprockets, but that only makes them seem outrageously gratuitous. Cruise, as always, plays Tom Cruise, in a self-conscious, vapid ""hero"" role we could care less about. The action scenes are ridiculous and the one sincere Woo moment (the spinning autos) is nicely staged but totally out of context."
"The_Void","7","1","2","30 August 2005"," Tom Cruise's show
","Brian De Palma's original worked more through suspense and style than action, but it's obvious that star and producer Tom Cruise wanted the stunts to star this time round, and so action director John Woo was recruited. While the first film was better made than this sequel, the change of focus has actually turned out to be no bad thing, as Mission: Impossible II is a more thrilling and far more accessible film than the first. Really, this isn't a sequel to the first film at all, with the only similarities between the two being that both Tom Cruise and Ving Rhames reprise their roles. I said their roles, not their characters and although the names have stayed the same; the characters haven't. Cruise's capable, yet slightly vulnerable persona in the first film has replaced by a glossy haired, all action terminator, and it's obvious that Cruise was more bothered about how he'll look on screen than staying true to the original. The plot, and everything in the film, plays second fiddle to Cruise's star profile, and while this can get annoying after a while; seeing Cruise tear his way through mountains of enemies has a sort of farcical brilliance to it.<br/><br/>As mentioned, the plot plays second fiddle; but surprisingly enough, it's actually not bad! We follow the creation of a genetically modified disease called ""Chimera"" and, of course, Cruise is on hand to dispatch it. One of his former colleagues wants to buy both the disease and the antidote so that he can infect everyone and then sell them the cure! This isn't the most brilliant of plots ever conceived, but it's a lot better than what I was expecting from a film like this. John Woo injects his usual panache to the film, including many shots of the leads in slow motion, double gun shootouts, motorbikes, doves...etc etc. While Woo obviously knows how to direct an action scene, it seems out of place in a film that's supposed to be about daring espionage. The original theme has been given an overhaul too, which is quite fitting since this has recycled just about everything else from the first movie. One idea from the first that's been used and used again is the rubber mask thing. This is good the first couple of times you see it, but after the twentieth time, it starts to get a little old. This is pretty much what you'd expect from an action film, but it takes it's main elements and does well with them. Really, this is a piece of kitsch; but it's an enjoyable one, and it's hard to really hate it."

This is either comic-book stuff or extreme paranoia or else the pharmaceutical-FDA connection really is Satanic.<br/><br/>I did enjoy some of it; the adrenaline-pumping scenes are seductive for the little kid in all of us.<br/><br/>This is not a good movie, IMO.

"ChrisTreborn","1","1","2","11 March 2005"," "" Original's Damaged Version ""
","I was almost blown away by watching Brian Da Palma's first Mission Impossible in 1996 only by it's story telling. When I knew there was a second story coming and this time from acclaimed director John Woo, I went Upside Down. But when I saw this anticipated sequel, all that expectations 'self destructed' in no seconds.<br/><br/>First of all Cruise is a damaged Hollywood actor, bounded in his 'super stardom'. For keeping his melting stardom he produced this sequel by disfiguring the creativity of Mr.Woo, making him to do things Beyond the LINES.<br/><br/>Mission Impossible 2 (Spoilers******) <br/><br/>Sequel to the 1996 movie, this time IMF agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) has been sent on a mission to retrieve and destroy the supply of a genetically created virus called 'Chimera'. For this he must trace down Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) by his ex-girl friend Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton). Things went wrong when an affair started to happen between Nyah and Hunt.<br/><br/>Scripted by veteran Hollywood screenwriter Robert Towne for the story of Ronald D. Moore and Brannon Braga, this movie moves with Romance, Tensions, and Actions. The STORY got nothing to contribute to the movie 'cause much of the script was incorporated around action scenes that director John Woo envisioned.<br/><br/>But his version was corrupted by TOM CRUISE's involvement, yes, Tom Cruise is the producer, so that means he must be portrayed as larger than God like character. Don't know What the hell Tom wanted from this movie. Cruise kept encouraging additional invention, wanting Woo to make things higher, wider, and faster. So we must see MI2 as an ACTION vehicle designed for Cruise, to his own specifications. <br/><br/>Even after such draw backs John Woo managed to gave his best for this movie. His stylized camera works, slow motions, plus fast cutting chasing action scenes. Especially the pigeon flying over Ethan when he appears from the fire flames, dialogues like ""Just stay alive, I am not going to loose you"", and that watery slow motion jumps. No one can capture that poetic movements except Woo.<br/><br/>Also the soul of the movie was created by Hans Zimmer. Not over than Danny Elfman's previous score, but it suits with the fast cutting tones. Hans Zimmer did a good job for providing a respected score with authentic flamenco styles with heavy metal action cues for this messy film.<br/><br/>All in all it's a great movie if we can forget the previous one. Cruise sucked in every crucial points in the movie, in interviews he even claimed that he did all his stunts. Then what was stunt guys Keith Campbell and Ron Kauk doing in the mountains, why Jimmy N. Roberts and Matt Mingay credited for motor cycles stunt doubles? Mr. Super G*Y want to fool us.<br/><br/>Only thing happened good in the movie was its production conflicts and delays. Because of that, Dougray Scott had to give up his upcoming movie X-Men. And that role went to Mr. Hugh Jackman. O my GOD! What would have happened if the movie finished at the correct schedule in Australia? Huh, a great loss for the Australians and rest of the world (Jackman was from Australia and I can't assume any one in the place of Logan, he is the perfect Wolverine for the X-Men movie) <br/><br/>I give this movie 1 out of 10!<br/><br/>M I :2 = A Good Wrong Movie."

","It's an odd phenomenon, that of the box office. I'm finding as I have reviewed literally hundreds of movies here at IMDb, that those which gross highest at the box office aren't necessarily the highest rated films. That in itself is peculiar, in my opinion.<br/><br/>Take for example, Mission Impossible 2. It had an increased budget ($125M as compared to MI1 which had a budget of $75M) and took in $545M (as opposed to MI1's $452M worldwide estimate), yet MI2 rates a 5.7 while MI1 rated a 6.6 among users here at IMDb. Isn't that interesting? It made more money, sold more tickets, yet was an inferior movie.<br/><br/>""Sequels, by definition alone, are inferior films."" Randy, Scream 2<br/><br/>I found this work playful, innovative, and fun. It was not, however, as edgy or fresh as the first. MI2 tried too hard to be ""hip,"" or cool, and it just came off as another ghetto flick in spite of the stellar performances, well choreographed and executed action sequences, and interesting plot turns.<br/><br/>This sequel obviously rode the coattails of its original in the hopes that MI1 was strong enough to carry a weaker installment. Obviously that tactic worked. My question is, ""Will MI1 also be expected to carry MI3?"" I surely hope not, or the next installment could be the death of the franchise.<br/><br/>This rates a 6.2/10 from...<br/><br/>the Fiend :."

","I borrowed the DVD of this from a friend (whom I no longer speak to) (only joking!).<br/><br/>Among other things this movie pornographises violence (as I understand the term) for the sake of cheap thrills by showing that the human body can take so much more punishment than it actually can. There is no way that 2 people can smash into each other at 120mph, then fall 40 feet onto a beach and then stand up and then stand up and have a fight with each other for 10 minutes (unintentional laughter abounds). It sends out the wrong message to kids who might be unfortunate enough to be watching that this can happen. Hopefully, kids are more sophisticated than I think.<br/><br/>There is no dramatic tension in this movie at all and the plot, what plot? It self-destructed 5 seconds before the movie began. The characters have the depth of cardboard, which is an insult to cardboard and many good actors, including Cruise, are wasted - Anthony Hopkins appears to be wearing a grin during his scenes that seems to just be saying ""I'm getting $1 million for saying 12 lines and being in the film 3 minutes. I love this job!"".<br/><br/>Did I mention the unintentional laughter? This movie has it by the shed load. I kept expecting Charlie Sheen to appear during the endlessly absurd 'action' scenes and Tom Cruise tries desperately to be cool and stylish but comes off looking like a prat. I defy anyone to watch the scene where Tom walks past the burning doorway while the dove flies past and Dougray Scott says ""Run that b*stard down!"" without laughing. I sure as hell did.<br/><br/>I liked Face/Off and I generally like most of Mr Woo's other movies but this one should just be flushed down the pan - it is just a 2-hour commercial for crassness and stupidity.<br/><br/>I gave it a 2, I would have given it a 1 except for the added entertainment value of the unintentional laughter.

This implied a level of intelligence both in the writing and the plot - both of which this film lacks. Maybe I'm viewing the TV series through the rose tinted glasses of history, but I certainly looked forward to it being on every week. I don't think any sequels will be met with the same anticipation.

","One term that we critics like to throw around is ""Train wreck of an action film."" It would be nice to deploy such a phrase in this review, but that would not be fair. A more appropriate term would be ""Plane crash,"" or perhaps ""65 car pileup."" This is eye candy for the blind. The plot is so confusing that after three viewings I now realize that it made no sense in the first place. The first movie also had an impenetrable plot, but at least I could piece it together by forming my own explanations where it had none. With this, I have to form explanations for my explanation and theories for my theories. On my third viewing, I predicted, with near infallibility, what the next scene was and what dialogue was to take place. Yet I still could not come up with sound fill-in for a plot which sports more holes than Swiss cheese.<br/><br/>Just how was this allowed to happen with such an anticipated blockbuster? Is it not logical for the studios to be extra careful that these projects are done right? If that was what they wanted, then they sure picked the wrong director.<br/><br/>That man was John Woo, who in this case demanded that the script to be written around action scenes he wanted to film. The result was a herky-jerky final cut that ran a ludicrous 3 1/2 hours, which left the good folks at Paramount Pictures with two uninviting options. They demanded drastic cuts, the surest way of wrecking a film. Still, it was better than shelving the project completely.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie is...why bother? Tom Cruise plays the good guy, Dougray Scott plays the bad guy, Thandie Newton plays a romantic interest to the good guy, and Richard Roxburgh plays the world's toughest twit. Scott wants to acquire a bio-weapon for evil, and Cruise wants to use it for good. The battleground is Sydney, Australia.<br/><br/>Beyond the plot exists the action and the acting, both of which were deprived of the quality they deserved.<br/><br/>Acting: No cast will look good when John Woo is the director. He carries his films with artsy direction and a martial arts overdose. From an acting standpoint, his directing is pathetic. Tom Cruise may be a convincing actor in his other works, but not here, thanks to Mr. Woo. Thandie Newton's character is lacking greatly, but it would probably be a sin to condemn her acting skills based on this role alone. She does have a dazzling face, though.<br/><br/>The only person who seems immune to the Woo curse is Dougray Scott, who plays one of the most ridiculous characters in the history of the motion picture. There is no doubt that his character is evil, but he is so overboard it is almost laughable. There is one boneheaded scene where he severely cuts the finger of his ""best friend"" and most trusted ally. I am yet to figure a good reason for him to do that. The movie does not seem to notice, as the next day his friend is back on the job, loyal as ever.<br/><br/>Action: For this, Woo uses slow motion more than real time. Not only is this incongruous, but it interrupts and destroys otherwise good action. Not that it matters, since few people really care by the time Good Guy and Bad Guy are at each other's throats. <br/><br/>I almost feel bad, now, for ripping ""Charlie's Angels,"" in my review.  At least that was harmless fun. Between this and ""The Avengers,"" I have seen nearly every rule of good filmmaking violated before my eyes.<br/><br/>Sidenote: I am actually looking forward to the sequel, seeing that Joe Carnahan will direct. Hopefully he will take note of what went wrong with the first two, make the necessary corrections, and make a solid film that we fans can enjoy."

The movie has a charming and very smooth color like, very nice filmed and stuff and that makes a twist between hot romance and bloody bad-guys. Cruise stars again as Ethan Hunt but this time the villain is the Irish Dougray Scott and my-lady is Thandie Newton as Nyah Hall. The movie fits very good and has some scenes that really entertains with big E, for an example the motorbike chase between Hunt and Ambrose (Scott), the final climax kung-fu between the same two guys, the shooting scene in the lab, the chopper wiring down Hunt, the flamingo dancing Spanish (beautiful) and last but not least the opening climbing scene. The film futures sometimes highly pro and interesting progress and charisma, but is maybe too much for the goods when it all gets hooked up by the same slow-motion effect all the time. A very peace-and-love scene is when Hunt has just blown up a door and the frame stands in fire, Ambrose looks and you can clearly see the shining from the fire in his eyes, a dove flies upon threw the door and next comes Hunt walking in slow-mo. past the door, flaring in Ambrose's eyes.

Put it this way, if you enjoyed the first M:I for its emphasis on teamwork and convoluted storytelling, then don't even bother with the sequel, as the credited director John Woo should give you a damn good idea of what to expect.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise returns as IMF agent Ethan Hunt, our intrepid spy who now appears to have a knack for rock climbing and martial arts.  His assignment is to recruit thief Nyah Hall (Thandie Newton) to go undercover for the agency to spy on renegade agent Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) and his formidable army of henchmen.  Ambrose has plans of becoming a billionaire, but in doing so, could cause great devastation to the population of Australia.  Naturally, it's up to Hunt to rescue the girl, kill the bad guy, and save the day.<br/><br/>
Through and through, M:I-II never feels like anything less than a Woo production.  Almost all his signatures are here: balletic slow motion, two-fisted guns a'blazing, flying doves, and a sort-of gun standoff.  The only thing missing here is the countless gallons of blood we've come to expect.  M:I-II, as it turns out, is his first and only PG-13 production, and the lack of ultraviolence didn't bother me in the slightest.<br/><br/>What is less forgivable is the almost utter lack of action in the first seventy minutes.  Well, that's not entirely true.  There is that climbing sequence and the car chase not long thereafter, but Cruise doesn't even stand off against his first true nemesis until after an hour in.  What's to hold our attention until then?  Maybe the plot, if you're into typical Bond stuff, which is exactly what this story is, typical Bond material.  We've got the almost megalomaniacal villain (he doesn't want the world, but he wouldn't mind devastating parts of it to get what he wants), the gorgeous love interests, and a few neat gadgets here and there.<br/><br/>When the action hits, M:I-II is almost a non-stop thrill ride, delivering tense gun battles, a fast-paced and simply awesome motorcycle chase (one of my favorite John Woo action scenes), and a fun mano-a-mano duel to the death.  Cruise is completely convincing as a physical action star, he's got the style, the charisma, and the moves.  He's the star of the show, which might disgust some, but he capably carries the production.  Newton makes for a gorgeous love interest, and Ving Rhames is THE man as Luther Stickell, everyone's favorite computer hacker.  Dougray Scott disappoints as the villain, though, he doesn't conjure enough spite and isn't menacing enough.<br/><br/>From beginning to end, if there is one consistency to M:I-II, it's how lovely the film looks.  Shot on beautiful locations with a great eye, this is a movie that's always nice to look at.  As such, the film should be enjoyed for what it is, an action blockbuster in the vein of James Bond. Sure, it probably could have used a tad more action in the first half and Woo does go overboard on the slow-mo by the finale, but M:I-II is purely fun stuff, and when the action's on-screen, it's exhilarating."

","This movie is vintage Woo.  From Tom Cruise welding two guns, to the motorcycle chase, to the man to man fight on the beach.  This is the best movie John Woo has made in America.  Face/Off is at a close second.  What sets this movie apart is the way John Woo makes Tom Cruise look like the hero of heros.  John Woo has Tom jumping, rolling, sliding, shooting, kicking and punching, in this MUST SEE for any action fan.  All of Woo's movies has proved that no one does action like the master of action. Woo's influence is seen everywhere from James Cameron to Michael Bay.  There is no doubt that John Woo is here to stay."

"DominqueZarinha","1","1","2","31 December 2002"," What was this?!!!
","This movie literally slapped me in the face when I first saw it. The trailer had me very excited but when I saw it, I was glad my sister talked me out of going to see it in cinema, would have been a waste of my 20 dollars. What were they thinking by making Tom Cruise do some really lame a** fight sequences? Were they trying to make him look bad?! I think they succeeded. Several times, they showed him doing some really dumb and absurd moves!!! It annoyed me when I saw it, I just fast-forwarded!!<br/><br/>Then there's Tom and Thandie (Ethan and Nyah). They were like a...""confused"". She particularly annoyed me with her stupid one-liners.<br/><br/>One minute, they sleep together, then they are disagreeing! How annoying!! Then there's the villain, Dougray Scott (Sean Ambrose) who seem to know when and where Tom Cruise would be each time. Come on, John Woo, what is that?!! And what's with the wide angle camera shot at the beginning?!! Too cliche! Every action movie has that!!! And the most confusing thing about this movie, up to this day that I will never understand, is the scene where Tom and Thandie are driving and their cars start to spin parallel to each others. What..How..Who..When..?!!!! Huh?!!!! And Sean knew what Nyah was up to from the start! Come on, John Woo or whoever wrote this crappy script!! No!! And don't even get me started on the use of the face masks!! How is it that Ethan Hunt knew to carry a mask of Hugh (Richard Roxburgh) when he went to the place where they were exchanging the virus for the money?!!!! That is way too smart!!! John Woo should take a hint from the director of the ""Die Hard"" franchise. Now that is pure blooded action!! John Woo has failed in his attempt to deliver another masterpiece like ""Face Off"". May his English was so bad that Tom Cruise and the others decided ""what the hey, I can't understand him so I'll just do my own thing"" This movie should have been rated PG! The violence, my nephew was laughing at how stupid it was!!! There was no intense violence. Even a 2 year old child would pelt popcorn at the TV when this is going on because they think it is stupid!! The first movie was sooo much better than this pack of bulls***!! People only wasted their good money to see this movie because Tom Cruise was in it. I hope that the 3rd part is going to really bring back the real MI. Has the world gone mad when they were making this film?!! I would love to know who wrote this s***!! It really annoyed me! Tom Cruise, you disappointed me! That was not you! You can do much better. To movie lovers out there, STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE UNLESS YOU WANT TO GET A LAUGH BECAUSE IT IS MORE LIKE A COMEDY THAN ACTION (THE ACTION SEQUENCES WILL HAVE YOU LAUGHING IN ANNOYANCE OF THIS STUPID FILM). Rating-0.00001/10. That is how awful it was!!!"
"Nick_Dets","Null","1","2","26 August 2002"," An action packed follow up
","When I saw ""Mission Impossible"" back in '96, I found it too confusing and even muddled to be entertaining.  Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt character looked to have a promising future, however.<br/><br/>   In '00, when ""M:I-2"" was released, I found it better than its predecessor.  It has a complex, but easier to follow plot and a lot more action (beautifully done by John Woo).<br/><br/>   Hunt is called off holiday to recruit beautiful theif (Thandy Newton) to help him catch her former boyfriend Sean Ambrosse (Dougray Scott), a renegade agent who is plotting to unleash a deadly German virus.<br/><br/>   Tom Cruise is great again, reprising his role.  Hunt is transformed into a more James Bond-type character, but it's for the better.<br/><br/>   There is one little flaw that I must call to attention to, however.  The use of masks becomes too convinient that by the end of the film, credibility is lost.<br/><br/>    Nevertheless, expect a highly entertaining, well made and sylish action/adventure from action wonder John Woo."
"JasonS-5","1","1","2","8 August 2002"," Total Disappointment
","I usually remember movies for a very long time after I see them. I think its significant that I barely remember anything about this movie except that I didn't like it. <br/><br/>As interesting and exciting as the first Mission Impossible movie was, that was how dull and flat this movie was. It just seemed like they strung together a bunch of the bits that worked from the first movie and gave Tom Cruise's character long hair and called it a different movie.<br/><br/>
There was a plot, I guess, I think, maybe. I remember it largely involved Tom Cruise being in Australia. <br/><br/>As appealing as the characters in the first movie were, that's how cold, and hard to relate to as they were in the second movie.<br/><br/>John Woo's style of film-making appeals to a certain type of person. I'm not entirely sure what type of person this is, but I don't know whether I'm anxious to meet any of them, because every movie of his I've seen has been cold, mean, and violent. <br/><br/>I think that the best way to sum up MI2 is this: Suppose you were good friends with someone. You liked their company, you shared the same sense of humor, and had the same moral value. Suppose several years went by and you didn't see him, then one day he turns up uninvited at your house. He acts like a total jerk, insults you, hits on your wife, and finally demands that you loan him money. That's how I felt about ""Mission Impossible II"""
"mrmadcow66","1","1","2","15 June 2002"," John Woo is one of the worst directors alive.
","There's not much to say about this movie.  I don't know why, but for some reason before I saw this I thought John Woo was a good director.  I guess because Face/Off was pretty good.  I now know I was horribly, horribly wrong.  He drastically needs to get over himself.  No more super kick combo moves.  No more white doves.  No more flying motorcycles.  It's just stupid. How he could take something as great as the first Mission: Impossible and turn it into this is beyond me.  The plot of a ""horrible disease to be released on Earth"" lacks enough originality to even be the plot of a Bond film.  Please don't make anymore movies John.  You suck at it."

","The critics who hate this movie, don't take it for what it is- a cinematic action film.  Sure the story is weak and the acting is poor, but that's not what this movie is about.  MI 1 was too confusing (especially to those of us who never saw the show) MI2 was great though.  It was chock full of action. And the way it was presented is so cinematic.  It's best seen in the theaters, or at least on a good home theater.  Tom Cruise makes a great action hero.  The fact that the characters are two dimensional actually adds to it- It makes the action scenes slicker.  Just watch the movie wanting to be entertained and you'll like it.  8/10"

"PatrynXX","10","1","2","15 December 2000"," One of those rare movies that kicks better butt than it's predecessor
","I'll admit I was skeptical about this movie at first.  And in fact it took until today to finally watch it.  I was one of the minority I guess that thought the first one had a great plot.  I still like the first one.  But the sequel is a wee bit more Bondish than the first.  I however did find Anthony Hopkins a bit out of place.  I had assumed ....  Eugene Kittridge would be the head boss now.  But that was not to be.<br/><br/>The first half hour of the movie is rather slow, and it takes about 24 minutes to get to any main characters. One suggestion... don't watch this on video.  It would be better on DVD with a stereo hooked up to it.<br/><br/>It has John Woo's unique slow motion shots throughout and does get annoying I suppose, but I liked it.  They don't really have the tearjerker type thingy going on like the first.  (SPOILER...... to the first one included)<br/><br/>which as everyone knows Emilio gets his rather abruptly as well as everyone else.  and Claire as well in the end.<br/><br/>The good guys body count is much better here.    Dougray Scott I've seen twice before.  First as a rather wimpy camera man in Deep Impact and then as a kewl good guy in Ever After.  I will admit, I much prefer Mr. Scott in Ever After than to MI 2 but Woo made him into an excellent villain here.<br/><br/>I am disappointed that the end of the movie contained some rather unoriginal music.  I'd heard it in The Rock and my dad was telling me before I watched the movie that it originally came from a Bud commercial.  Stick the music where it should be will yah..  Don't recycle it.  Other than that I loved the score.....  get the DVD 10/10"
"Stuart Turner","10","1","2","13 December 2000"," Fantastic, Best film of the year so far
","The problem as I see with most of the negative comments about this film are that people try to pick holes and think too hard about a film which at the end of the day is straight forward action flick,<br/><br/>Now I've had my whinge lets get to the positive points, John Woo never ceases to amaze me, he took the action movie to the next level with Face/Off, MI2 takes it further with some of the most breathtaking action scenes and camera work the industry has seen. At times the action becomes almost a ballet of violence with Cruise dancing between bullets and explosions whilst dispatching the bad guys without a second glance, the stunts are great in particular the motorbike chase scene and the firefight at the Biocyte H.Q.  The acting although not stretching for the likes of Cruise and Rhames suites the film perfectly with both of them turning in solid performances. On the same note Dougray Scott was born for the part of Sean Ambrose the evil former I.M agent, and credit must also go to Thandie Newton for turning what could have easily been a stereotypical damsel in distress role in to something a little special.<br/><br/>In short well done John Woo ( who sees things other directors wouldn't dream of ) well done Tom Cruise ( for doing most of his own stunts and making the film so watchable ) and well done Paramount Pictures ( for having the guts to commision the second film after such an ordinary first one)<br/><br/>A special mention must go to the quality of this film on its DVD release. I saw the film at the cinema in the summer and bought it on the day of release on DVD earlier this week, the extras on the disc make the film even more enjoyable and is well worth Â£17. A final note for all budding directors, the action film has been redefined again, I'd like to see you do better !!<br/><br/>Face/Off 2 or MI3 anyone !!"
"n2racr24","8","1","2","11 December 2000"," Two Movies For the Price of One!
","This movie truly could have been great.  I mean incredible.  Instead, it was two different movies.  The first movie was one about some girl breaking up with some guy, Tom Cruise taking her back and them falling in love. During this first hour or so of film, I was so bored I don't even remember what all happened.  THAT's how bad it was.  Just a bunch of random scenes all tied together somehow.  Then the characters... normally I don't care about ""underdevelopment,"" especially in action films.  But we get a glimpse of some Aussies then suddenly we know them like we know Cruise's character? Huh?<br/><br/>Well the second movie... rocked!  John Woo all the way.  No doubt about it. Face/Off times ten.  True action.  No way around it.  Some of the most hair raising sequences and most unrealistic.  Still, it was incredible.  I had a blast during this film.<br/><br/>So, we are presented with 3 films... the first one, M:I 1, the original, remains true to the original series.  The second film, M:I 2.1, bores the hell out of you.  The third one, M:I 2.2, is the best of the series.<br/><br/>Overall:  6.5 out of 10."

"jiangliqings","10","1","2","10 December 2000"," Pulse-pounding action entertainment.
","*** 1/2 stars out of ****<br/><br/>Mission: Impossible 2 is a rare sequel that surpasses the original, which was a bit too complex for its own good.  This time around, with director John Woo at the helm, Tom Cruise back, and Robert Towne writing the script, the sequel is considerably easier to understand in terms of story, and the action scenes are some of the wildest and best in years.<br/><br/>The story doesn't really matter that much in a film like this.  It's basically James Bond over again, this time with Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) out to stop former IMF agent Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) and his henchmen from stealing Chimera, a deadly man-made virus that kills in less than 2 days. To penetrate Ambrose's security, Hunt hesitantly brings in thief Nyah Hall (Thandie Newton) to work her charms over Ambrose; she was also his former lover.<br/><br/>But not everything goes according to plan, and Ambrose discovers Nyah's real purposes for coming back to him and plans to kill her, but she injects herself with the last strain of the virus.  With 20 hours left, Hunt must retrieve Bellerophon, the virus's only cure, and stop Ambrose from delivering the virus over the world.<br/><br/>M:I2 is entirely different in style from its predecessor.  It works as pure action entertainment, and it's all the better for it.  Though it doesn't bring in fight after fight from the beginning, it's never dull, with charismatic performances, great direction as usual from John Woo, and some lovely cinematography.<br/><br/>Woo's usual over-the-top style is here, with a little more restraint in terms of blood and gore, but there's no mistaking his touch in the film. His trademarks are here, and as strong as ever.  This film is easily better than the last several Bond movies.  After an entertaining set up, the last 40 minutes are packed with non-stop action, with Woo turning in amazing set piece after set piece.  Whether it's a chaotic shootout in a secret lab, a long motorcycle chase that features a barage of breathtaking stunts (one of Woo's all-time best action scenes, a real compliment), or a climactic martial arts duel on a beach, the last 1/3 of the film don't disappoint if its action you're looking for.<br/><br/>The performances are solid for a film of this genre.  Tom Cruise simply exudes coolness as superspy Ethan Hunt, who is truly becoming an even more compelling hero than James Bond.  Thandie Newton is relatively decent as the love interest, though she's a little nonexistent in the last half hour due to the non-stop action.  Ving Rhames gets some good lines in, providing comic relief along with some action muscle.  Dougray Scott is all right as the villain.  We don't really hate him as much as we should, but he does the physical parts of the role quite well.<br/><br/>There are a lot of other little elements that work in M:I2.  Hans Zimmer composes another strong score, which reminds a tad of his own work in Gladiator.  The special effects are brilliantly done, the settings are exotic, and everybody involved seems to be enjoying themselves. A can't miss film if you love action."
"Jim West-3","8","1","2","8 December 2000"," Give it a second chance!
","Ok, I agree this film is in no way perfect. Saying that, it is a great action film. What else would you expect from John Woo? I found certain things in this film to be unnecessary. The slow moving shots in Spain, while the chemistry between Cruise and Newton was being set alight for example. There was no need at all for the (what I found annoying) black dress, sweeping across the screen! I also saw no need for the constant use of white doves in the latter half of the film. I understand what they were there to represent, but they (like the dress) became increasingly annoying.<br/><br/>On a positive note, the opening to the film, in the Australian outback was fantastic. And, after watching the ""making of"" documentary on the DVD, I am even more impressed. I don't think I ever truly believed that Action Man Tom actually did most of those stunts himself! The best part of the film is in the Chimera Lab. The tension, action and especially the score come together to make that a great scene. I think that it is worth watching the film just for that few minutes.<br/><br/>I do think that casting Dougray Scott as the villain was a bad idea. He doesn't seem to quite give his character enough menace. One thing that we can thank Paramount for, in regards to casting him, is, that he was unable to play Wolverine in X-Men due to the over run shooting schedule. Thank God!<br/><br/>All I can say is, try and give M;I-2 a second chance. It really isn't as bad a film as everyone first thinks. Yes, it has its faults. But don't ALL films? I think that it is an enjoyable action film, but it just doesn't come close to being as good as the first Mission Impossible."

"TxMike","Null","1","2","24 November 2000"," A great film for ""action junkies"", with very active surround sound.
","How you ""rate"" M:i-2 depends totally on your expectations. If you are expecting a film fairly true to the original TV series, it is probably a ""3"". If all you want is some of the finest action and special effects with an aggressive sound track, it is probably a ""10"". In reality, the film is somewhere between those two extremes, plays more like a James Bond movie, pretty girl caught between the good and the bad guys, a simple story, of a deadly mutant virus designed to sell the ""cure"", and the bad guys always lose in the end. I found it totally enjoyable, laughed often at the intended absurdity of much of it.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise and Dougray Scott are fine as the rivals. With all the masks and identity-switching, it is hard to tell sometimes who is who. The DVD picture and sound are first-rate, the rear surround channels are used a lot, with a great impact. As is the subwoofer for the various explosions, and there are lots of them, typical of a John Woo film.<br/><br/>The DVD ""extras"" are mandatory. Avoid seeing ""M:i-2"" on videotape if you can. There are ""making-of"" sequences for 11 of the major stunt scenes, describing how they came about, how they were engineered, and how they were shot. In fact, I found that watching the ""making-of"" before actually watching the movie added to my enjoyment on first viewing. <br/><br/>Some of the more interesting ""extras"" commentary describes how Tom Cruise ended up doing almost all of his stunt work, even though they had employed stunt men. Apparently Cruise loves the danger, and seems to be a natural stunt man, learning novel moves very quickly and well. The rock-climbing at Dead Horse Point, the motorcycle ""asphalt skiing"", the dive from the helicopter into the office building, the hand-to-hand combat on the beach, the motorcycle jousting scene, and others.<br/><br/>Another is a 6-minute MTV spoof, where Ben Stiller plays ""Tom Crooze"", the long-time stand-in for Tom Cruise. It is cute and entertaining.<br/><br/>I rate it a solid ""8"" of 10 for overall enjoyment."
"FlickJunkie-2","6","1","2","22 November 2000"," Impossible to believe
","The purpose of this silly action adventure flick seems to have been to live up to its name.  The malarkey they want us to swallow is so utterly impossible that this film could easily be one of the most laughable movies of 2000.  Fifty bad guys shoot 10,000 bullets at Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) with automatic weapons, but never even wing him.  Hunt, armed only with pistols, kills a bad guy with every bullet he fires, often killing them three at a time while somersaulting through the air.<br/><br/>John Woo (Broken Arrow, Face/Off) is a veteran of action adventure films and his expertise in this area is evident throughout the film.  It contains stupendous action sequences throughout, though I thought Woo's attempt to turn Tom Cruise into Jackie Chan was a bit much.  Woo also chose some breathtaking locations and the photography was first rate.<br/><br/>Ronald Moore's (Star Trek: Generations) story was an utterly unoriginal excuse to keep half of Hollywood's stunt actors employed.  The dialogue was wretched.  If one more character ripped off his face, I would have stomped the DVD.<br/><br/>The acting was nothing special.  Cruise really had nothing intelligent to say or do, so the best I can say about him is that he was in great shape and showed us what a good athlete he is.  Thandie Newton (Beloved) was initially very dynamic and sassy, but by the end of the film, she was reduced to a quivering jellyfish.  Dougray Scott was fair as the villain, but lacked the wickedness to make him truly hateful. <br/><br/>This film did well at the box office grossing over $200 Million, a testimonial to the American public's inherent need to see stuff blown up without the burden of having to lug their brains to the movie theater.  I rated this film a 6/10 on the strength of Woo's fabulous action sequences. Wear earplugs (to protect your ears from the loud explosions and the insipid dialogue) and don't expect to be mentally stimulated."

Inaccuracies range from those research would have cleared up (viruses use RNA, not DNA), through those a moment's thought would have cleared up (how can a virus which is fatal in less than two days, and almost impossible to transmit, cause an epidemic?), to those which are just loopy (how can there be a disease which becomes incurable after EXACTLY twenty hours, to the MINUTE, whatever the sex, size, age or initial state of health of the person infected?).<br/><br/>Anyway: it's still amazing stuff.  All that heart-stopping rock climbing at the beginning and slow motion photography - PROPER slow-motion photography, which never feels as if it's dragging its heels. At once exhilarating and suspenseful.  My only previous exposure to Woo had been the execrable ""Face/Off"".  It goes without saying that this film is a hundred times better.  (It IS a mystery to me why people were so excited about it in advance: as I said, Woo's previous Hollywood effort had shown no grounds for hope at all, and it's not as if anyone liked the original ""Mission: Impossible"".  I guess it's one of those hype things I'll never understand.) -Sure, the token woman was very hard to take: an unlovable drifter of no fixed abode or accent, and if she was REALLY in love with Ethan Hunt, I renounce any claim to being able to read anyone's state of mind.  And some of the lines ... dear oh dear.  I don't think the gliding, enfolding cinematography EXCUSES these faults, but it's more than enough to make the film worth watching."

","Okay...this was awesome!  To begin with I am an action film fanatic and this had all the right stuff in that department, car crashes, chases, explosions, gun violence...ect.  Then it has the one thing that completely won me over: T.C. with long hair and leather....and a villian (D.S.) who is not as sexy as T.C. but comes damn near close....to relate this in terms of leather wearing guys, Keanu is nothing compared to T.C.  Remember to catch this one in theaters so you can see T.C. larger than life...."
"Bob den Hartog","10","1","2","20 September 2000"," Finally a sequel which is so much better than the original!
","Don't get me wrong, I also liked ""Mission: Impossible"" a lot, but that movie was just too complicated for a movie with that much stunts and action. It's not that I don't like that kind of movie, but it is just not the sort of thing you expect from a movie like that. The makers of ""M:I-2"" learned of that, and gives the audience now a terrific ride which you just have to see!<br/><br/>I heard a lot of different reactions of this movie, and I found out that you hate this movie or love it.<br/><br/>I don't know why there are persons who hate this movie, because I absolutely loved it! It really has everything you can expect from this kind of movie. It has humor, romance, action and a lot of absolutely spectaculair stunts performed by Tom Cruise himself.<br/><br/>This movie also has an outstanding score by Hans Zimmer who also did before the fantastic music and songs of ""The Prince of Egypt"" and the great score of ""The Rock"".<br/><br/>Plus the great performance of Thandie Newton and a great Dougray Scott (from ""Ever After"") as the villain.<br/><br/>This movie is also from the beginning to the end visually fantastic. John Woo knows, as always, how you can show an action sequence at his best and his slow-motion shots really never get boring.<br/><br/>Just see this movie as soon as you can. Hate it or love it, see for yourself, but you just HAVE to see this."

","I LOVE This movie! It was awesome! It was exciting the whole entire time and the chase scene at the end with the motorcycles was absolutely awesome! The Slow motion made the movie seem more real and I loved it! Tom Cruise and Thandie were great together! It was kinda fake when the van exploded and luther still lived and there were a few other Not-very-likely situations but after all this is an action adventure and things are gonna happen that usually wouldn't. other than that the movie was AWESOME!! !Couldn't be better! The cast was fabulous and dougray made the PERFECT bad guy! Anthony hopkins of course was fabulous and since tom did all his stunts it was even better! Much better than the first one! on a scale of 1-10 I give it a 11! EVERYONE should see this movie! Even if the don't like action adventure films!<br/><br/>Jon woo did fabulous on the stunts but I must say there were a few too many pigeons!<br/><br/>BEST MOVIE EVER! AN ABSOLUTE FAVORITE!

"Banter","1","1","2","29 August 2000"," Mission Impossible 2 was a very thought-provoking movie.
","Mission Impossible 2 was a very thought-provoking movie. In that, I mean that it caused me to think that instead of watching Mission Impossible 2, I could have simply surrendered my nine bucks to the people down at the theatre.  Gone down to the local hardware store, purchased a screwdriver, stabbed myself in the eyeball a few dozen times and still would have the larger portion of two hours un-wasted with the same experience gained.<br/><br/>In all truth, Mission Impossible 2 wasn't a `BAD' movie. It just failed to deliver what its name implied. I went to the theatre expecting to see at least a little, Mission Impossible. To my surprise, I got a cross between `James Bond', `Die Hard' and Tom Cruise's personal fantasy of himself. If the name `Mission Impossible' meant seventy or so shooting deaths, a super unrealistic motorcycle chase scene (in which the motorcycles used, magically changed from street, to off-road tires depending on the need), little to no intrigue, and a ninja `Power Rangers' type climax, then yes, Mission Impossible 2 was right on. I'd have to say the movie's only redeeming quality had to be Ving Rhames (who, by the way, was in the movie for a total of about 27 seconds). On a scale of `Pathetic' to `Excellent', I give this movie a `Lame'."
"suziq2307","10","1","2","24 August 2000"," One of the Best Action-Thriller Movies of the Summer!
","First of all, I am very surprised about all the bad reviews that I have read on this movie.  Thank God there are some good reviews, about 1/2.<br/><br/>I would like to comment on how stylish and breathtaking this movie is.  I have never seen Tom Cruise on the ""big screen"" until I saw MI-2 back in the end of July.  I was totally blown away with this movie.  After I saw this movie, I went out and rented all of his other movies.  Many of them were Oscar worthy material and he is one of the best actors to hit the theaters in a long time.<br/><br/>I especially give him credit for his collaboration with John Woo on this movie.  It looks like they put a lot of time and effort into making this a blockbuster!  I believe that it has surpassed expectations and has become one of the hottest movies of the Summer.<br/><br/>Now to my review of this movie.  I thought that Tom Cruise was outstanding as Ethan Hunt.  He expanded his character to be more sexy, romantic, sensitive, caring and cool and he knew how to get the job done. We just didn't see this side of his character in MI-1, except being intelligent and getting the job done.  But don't get me wrong, MI-1 was a great movie.  I also was one of the people who actually understood the plot!  I have always regretted that I have not seen MI-1 in the theater, I saw it on video. But you can't compare the two movies.  They were completely different.  I think that I read an article where Tom stated that he wanted every MI movie to be different.  MI-2 is more of an action-thrill ride than the first movie and that was all it was supposed to be!!!<br/><br/>Tom did a great job in acting this role.  It seems to have been a lot of fun for him along with his hard work as Producer as well.  His producing and John Woos directing spell SUCCESS! I also give him credit for doing the majority of his own stunts.  How many actors today would take the risk?<br/><br/>I also thought that the other actors, Vring Rjames, Dougray Scott, Anthony Hopkins, were also very good, as well as Thandie Newton, in their respective roles.  I thought that they complimented Tom Cruise very well!!<br/><br/>Contrary to many of the other reviews on the plot, I thought that the plot was interesting (not stupid), fun to watch, an exhilarating action thriller and pure entertainment.<br/><br/>I thought (contrary to some reviews), that the chemistry between Ethan Hunt and Nyah Nordoff Hall was mesmerizing, cute, romantic, sexy and great to watch.  Tom has never looked better.  He is absolutely gorgeous! and she is very beautiful.  I feel a little jealous of her!!! I would like to comment also on Tom's non-speaking acting.  His expressions on his face are priceless.  Without saying a word, you know exactly what he is feeling. He definitely did not want Nyah anywhere near Shawn Ambrose, but he also knew that he had a job to do. Having Nyah as a Trojan horse in the clutches of his nemesis was the only way to get the information he needed to save the world from catastrophy!<br/><br/>I certainly did not think that this movie was a ""Tom Cruise Ego Trip"".  He was playing a super-spy and just acted accordingly.  To the people who trashed his performance, I have this to say, Lighten Up!  You must be extremely jealous of him or you do not know how to sit back, relax and enjoy a fun and exciting Summer movie.  It wasn't supposed to make you think. It was supposed to entertain you!!!!  I think that you people need a life!<br/><br/>In conclusion, let me add that I have since seen this movie several times and I think that it gets better each time I see it!  I previously did not know John Woos work as an action director, with the exception of Face Off, which I loved.  I think that He did a brilliant job in directing this movie. I think that he wanted people to see all the (cliches) of his other movies in this movie.  Apparently, that is his style and he does it well. Also, the cinematography was spectacular!<br/><br/>If you still haven't seen this movie, than I won't spoil it for you.  See it.  You won't regret it!<br/><br/>Congratulations Tom and John on a job well done!  I will be anxiously awaiting MI-3.<br/><br/>I give this movie 10 out of 10 stars!!!!!!!!!!!"
"suziq2307","10","1","2","23 August 2000"," One of the Best Movies of the Summer of 2000!!!
","First of all, I am very disappointed to hear all the negative reviews on this movie.  I am also glad that at least 1/2 of the reviews were good. Now to my review on this movie.<br/><br/>First of all, I saw Tom Cruise for the first time on the ""big screen"" in this movie.  I thought that his performance as Ethan Hunt was positively mesmerizing!  In my opinion, his acting was very good and he showed a side of Ethan Hunt's personality that was not portrayed in the previous movie. Even when he doesn't talk, he is acting.  Just look at the expressions on his face when he doesn't speak.  I think that he was very convincing as Hunt and that he was sensitive and caring in his feelings for Nyah.  As for their chemistry, it was awesome, romantic and cute! Who says that you can't fall in Love after one night.  There are some people in this world who have done it!<br/><br/>I think that Tom Cruise is a very extraordinary actor.  After viewing this movie a few weeks ago for the first time, I took it upon myself to rent his other movies.  I feel that he has done equally well in all of his movies. Some of them are truely Oscar worthy performances.<br/><br/>Back to MI-2. Tom has matured since his role as Ethan in the last movie. He is very handsome, sweet, sensitive and caring and was generally concerned for the welfare of the people of Australia, as well as the world.  By the way, he was supposed to be a super-spy and therefore he acted accordingly. Some of his stunts were unbelievable, but they were supposed to be!! Wake up! I thoroughly enjoyed his performance.  Nyah was also interesting, pretty and a good actress.  I felt a little jealous of her!  Dougray Scott was OK as the villian and the actor that portrayed Luther was great. The other cast members were good performers.<br/><br/>I never felt that this movie was a ""Tom Cruise Ego Trip"" as many of you have stated, but that he was thoroughly enjoying himself in this movie and that he worked hard in giving his all to this movie, both in acting and producing. He is a very serious man when it comes to his acting (I read his book and he is a very interesting person in many ways). I give him credit for doing many of his own stunts (they were spectacular)!  I also enjoyed the directing style of John Woo.  I did not know his previous work, with the exception of Face Off, which I found enjoyable. MI-2 just blew me away!!!<br/><br/>MI-2 was spectacular, awe inspiring, great eye-candy, romantic, an edge on your seat action thriller, had great special effects and had wonderful cinematography.  I thought that the script wasn't half as bad as a lot of you have mentioned and I give Tom Cruise, John Woo and Robert Towne credit for collaborating and producing a great Summer movie!  I have seen 4 of the new Summer movies and MI-2, bar none, was the best movie this Summer.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I just want to say to the people who bashed this movie, that apparently you are either jealous of Tom Cruise or you don't know how to sit back, enjoy and be thoroughly entertained by a good action-packed Summer movie. I also liked MI and I found it easy to understand the plot! I have regretted not seeing the first MI in the theater, I saw it on video. This movie is totally different from that movie, but that is OK as they are supposed to be two different kinds of movies.  I found this movie more exciting than the first. This movie was pure entertainment and I felt good after seeing it.  This movie was nothing short of exhilerating. Incidentally, I have seen it several times and it gets better every time!!! The score was also fantastic!  I am not a ""heavy metal fan"" but I thoroughly enjoyed this score.<br/><br/>Go and see this movie on the ""big screen"".  You will not regret it!!!!!!<br/><br/>I give this movie a 10 out of 10!"
"davideo-2","Null","1","2","23 August 2000"," A bit better than the original....but not much
","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs<br/><br/>Having eagerly anticipated viewing the original in the summer of 1996,and then to view what was hailed by all the critics as the best blockbuster of the summer left me totally baffled at how jaw droppingly incoherent and poor it was.So,naturally,the moment a sequel was suggested,I did'nt show much interest,until I learned that John Woo was at the directorial helm.And this pretty much shows throughout the movie.Because if the man is utterly hopeless at piecing together an intricate,twisty turny plot,then boy does he know how to direct an action sequence,as is shown at the end.The explosions/fighting interlude ,involving motorbikes,vans,and ,as usual,many,many guns,was very well handled,and pretty much filled a very huge gap in a sagging movie.<br/><br/>On the performances front,Tom Cruise acts like he's desperately trying to get off to sleep in the role,occasionally getting agitated if someone nudges him,whilst it's shocking to think how much they must have payed Anthony Hopkins just for two scenes,one more involving only his voice,and Thandie Newton is incredably overrated,not just as an actress,but she's nowhere near as attractive as everyone makes her out to be either.<br/><br/>The worst aspect of the film is that it all just feels like a huge marketing gimmick,which,when you think about it,is always a hinderance in being entertained.Nevertheless,if action ,twisty turny plot revalations,and stunts (the hanging cliff-top thing at the beginning is truly breathtaking)and you either did'nt mind or quite enjoyed the original,this is another film that's much better catching at the cinema,than on video where it will probably lose all it's spectacle.***"

"Cyclops-13","10","1","2","14 August 2000"," Best action movie of 2000
","This was the best action movie made in the year 2000.  The action was great from start to finish.  The movie does slow down briefly during the initial meeting with Cruise and Newton, but once the team is assembled, this movie rocks.  Much better than Woo's other films such as Broken Arrow and the Replacement Killers and ten times as better than the first one although it was great also.<br/><br/>Mission Impossible 2 also shows that you can do action packed movies at the PG-13 level and not have all of the graphic violence, language and sex that most current movies do.  If your looking for a movie with the ultimate cliff hanger (literally) and thrill ride action, you need to see M:I2."
"psapearson","10","1","2","13 August 2000"," M:I-2 is a truly FANTASTIC film!
","I hadn't even seen the first Mission Impossible movie so didn't know 'exactly' what to expect when I went to see the sequel in a UK cinema recently. It was absolutely fantastic. It has a very similar structure, story and similar characters to the recent excellent James Bond films but has more engrossing and awe-inspiring scenes of action and fantastic scenery. The cast all perform brilliantly especially the supremely talented Mr. Tom Cruise who puts in another outstanding performance. Dougray Scott as the bad guy also deserves credit for his performance as does the rest of the cast.<br/><br/>I recommend this film to James Bond fans and all action/adventure/mystery/thriller fans and fans of similar genres.<br/><br/>All in all, an excellent film!"
"Janita Dusbee","10","1","2","12 August 2000"," really exciting
","I loves this movie, despite what other people might say. It's exiting, the storyline isn't complicated so you can focus on the great special effects. It's a real 'lay back with a big bag of popcorn and relax' movie. So what it's not very deep and thoughtfull? Movies without a great plot can be fun too... The only diseapointment in the movie is Nyah (Thandy Newton). After a great start, when she's powerful and smart, she ends up as a kind of James Bond girl, who needs to be saved by the good guy..."
"outatime84","9","1","2","5 August 2000"," It's all about John Woo

It doesn't compare to Face/Off, but it's satisfying enough."

I also enjoyed some previous Woo works, so the expectations were high, but the movie was SO BORING that i couldn't wait till the end. Plot? No plot AT ALL. It's even sillier than the recent James Bond. Don't waste your money and time! Wait till it comes out on video. 2 out of 10 for short length."

"Quibblio","8","1","2","1 August 2000"," Much Better that the First MI
","This film was, IMO, far superior to the original Mission Impossible.  It more accurately captured the feel of the original series and had a fresher directorial style, which seems to have brought more out of the cast than the original movie.  John Woo's action sequences were very ott, but worked in this movie.<br/><br/>Recommended if you like Impossible action scenes, colorful direction, and sexy catburglars."
"Liam-Og","8","1","2","28 July 2000"," The New 'James Bond'
","It seems that everything that Tom Cruise touches turns to gold, he must be Hollywood's biggest star at the moment. Even when he doesn't well at the box office, he seems to get critical acclaim and vice versa. This is a big shift away from the first movie but I think it really works, Cruise can pull off the character very well although he is a bit over the top at times. I don't think the film puts any real emphasis on the other characters in the film which is poor but the story is good enough and the action is superb. It's the new '007' for sure, we could end up with endless 'Mission Impossible' movies but as long as they are as good as the first two, I won't be complaining."

","After a splendidly confusing setup involving a Russian scientist, some kind of diabolical science experiment, M:I-2 tracks down its hero Ethan Hunt(Tom Cruise), in mid-vacation, hanging by his fingertips on the edge of a dazzling rock formation somewhere in Utah. It's a great moment of cinematic bravura, and its surely the perfect entry to a breathe-taking action flick. No-one's asking anyone to expect more.<br/><br/>The stunts are mind-boggling, the soundtrack's surely inspirational, Tom Cruise has given us a top performance. John Woo's certainly made a superb entertainer. It equals if not beats Face-Off(John Woo sticks to the face-masks in this one too). If there's anyone who's not going for it because ""the expected never happens"", don't ever miss it!"

Mr Woo, once more I bow to you. The photography was breathtaking, the iconic symbolism awe-inspiring and because of such  and the plethora of other techniques - the narrative flowed beautifully as it unfolded the story of Ethan Hunts sacrifice through to his redemption.  For those less attuned to cinematic narrative then I say don't waste your time searching for a story within cumbersome lexicon but instead sit back and try to enjoy the visual.  And heaven knows not many deliver action quite like Woo."

First of this movie contains many stunts performed by tom cruise.  the story is much easier to under stand than in the first movie. But some of the scenes are straight out of THE MATRIX. also the end of the film gets kind of weird when tom cruise is seen with a dove that flies around and just confuses people. also there is a large number of mask in this movie which makes in a little predictable. otherwise this is an all right movie and if you liked it you will be glad to hear that M:I-3 is up on the drawing board."

My biggest problem with this movie is that the characters keep changing faces too quickly and easily(You will have to see the film to know what I am talking about). The main reason that this film is better is the director, John Woo, nobody on the planet directs action like this man, nobody. Though compared to his Hong Kong efforts this movie is very watered down. But overall I recommend ""Mission Impossible 2""."
"bigjon29","10","1","2","18 July 2000"," Don`t believe the critics!!!
","First off i have to say that this film is amazing.It has great effects,stunning action sequences,good performances and most of all entertaining as hell. It really annoys me that the critics have bashed this film because for me the main reason for going to the cinema is to be entertained and if you are like me then you will love this film. Some critics have said that there are no gadgets in this film .....errr hello did i watch the same film as everyone else because in my opinion their were quite a few of those trademark M.I.gadgets. They also say that not much happens in the middle of the film.Again i have to disagree because they are expanding the storyline between Tom Cruise and the female lead.Also more is learned about the deadly virus and the effects it could cause. I don`t know about you but i thought this was pretty standard of most films,its called expanding the story. So finally if you are one of those people who nitpicks and says things like....""ah man that would not happen in real life"" then watch something else. Or if you`re like me and love to sit back and enjoy a visual tour de force of stunning filmmaking then watch Mission Impossible 2,I know i will be."
"S---Zeus","8","1","2","17 July 2000"," Pure (and i do mean PURE) Action!!!
","This is one of the best action movies i've seen! It's got action and lot's of it. John Woo (the director) did a wonderfull job of accomplishing what he does best - giving us more and more action. He likes to film things slow mode (so i've heard) and maybe it's because he doesn't wants us to miss it if we blink. He has proven himself to be a great action director in this movie and in his previous Hit movie ""Face/Off"". Though the action shown is not always realistic it's always fun to watch. And even if u don't like it u just have to ask yourself ""how did he do it???"" This movie was good - if you like PURE ACTION and don't mind that it's un-realistic at times (most of the times). The main charecter that was played great by Tom cruise (who also did the stunts by himself including the first scene with the mountain climbing). He jumps, bounces, shoots, hits, and showing us how brilliant he is (both charachter and actor).<br/><br/>Of course - like evry movie this one have it's down-sizes. I.E: the plot is a lot similar to other action movies. Someone steals a mass destruction weapon and uses it to get money.<br/><br/>Been there - Done that! And sure - the action parts are clearly unrealistic and people who like realistic films will leave this one with a little sense of disappointment.<br/><br/>But still - Great directing from John Woo and great acting from Tom Cruise and his co-actress.

"action-6","10","1","2","13 July 2000"," John Woo has delivered the goods!
","John Woo has done it again!  He has created a massive action thriller that guaranteed will become this summer`s biggest blockbuster, and probably one of the best movies of 2000. The movie stars, just as the original, agent Ethan Hunt.  Hardly a single shot was fired in the original movie, but all that has changed since this movie is directed by my favorite director, John Woo.  John Woo is the master of the action movie and can create stylish action scenes in a way that American action directors only can dream about. The last half of the movie shows you action scenes that will have you weeping with joy.  The action scenes in this movie are so cool! I can`t see why this movie was rated PG-13 in America, because the amount of violence means that it should`ve been given the R-rating(but then the little kids wouldn`t get to see this) Some people out there seem to think that John Woo has just copied the amazing action scenes of ""The Matrix"".  This is completely wrong. These people don`t understand that the action scenes of ""The Matrix"" weren`t original, because the directors ""borrowed"" heavily from John Woo movies like ""Hard Boiled"", ""The Killer"" and ""Face/Off"".  The actionscenes in MI-2 are pure John Woo.<br/><br/>The actors are great.  I never really liked Tom Cruise much, but he is good in this movie.  I really liked that Tom Cruise did all his stunts on his own, because John Woo`s previous Hollywood-blockbuster ""Face/Off"" suffered from the fact that it was many times very easy to see that the spectacular scenes were done by stunt-men.  John Woo hasn`t tried to disguise the fact that this movie is pure entertainment and nothing else, but it is nice to see that the spy-element is also present.  Go to the cinema and prepare for a rollercoaster ride that is tougher and meaner than any James Bond-movie! 10/10"

","Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to stop a renegade from unleashing a deadly virus on the unsuspecting world.  Possibly the most basic plot of all time provides the scaffold on which John Woo hangs the action in this second M:I film.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is back as Ethan Hunt, sent to steal the Chimera virus back from baddy Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott), with the help of master thief Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton).<br/><br/>What follows from this is typical Woo; big explosions and balletic action sequences skillfully blended together.  Pure, unadulterated eye candy.<br/><br/>The three principal characters put in workman-like performances although characterisation, like the plot, doesn't seem to have been top of the directors list.  Newton especially is relegated to a background roll pretty quickly, although she does provide a pivot around which the last third of the film revolves.  Scott as Ambrose is fantastic, although Cruise seems bemused at times by all the action going on around him.  An honourable mention must also go to Ving Rhames.<br/><br/>The pace is frantic from start to finish, lagging only when the plot takes even a slight turn or when the next big action sequence is being lined up.<br/><br/>A good film, but not a great one."
"stamper","7","1","2","8 July 2000"," The Woo - Meister strikes again
","Well this is a crappy film of course, everything goes wrong here Woo changes his formula, Thandie Newton is ugly and can't act, Ving Rhames and Cruise are bad also and the script sucks. You've seen the commercial you've seen the best!!!<br/><br/>
(just kidding)<br/><br/>
This is a good movie, the story is OK, Cruise and Newtons chemistry are good, Rhames is good, the villain is good. The action sequences are good (sometimes brilliant and sometimes OK and most of the time good). The direction is true Woo style. Better than the first.<br/><br/>7,5 out of 10 can't be given here, so let's make that an 8 out of 10"
"conradi","9","1","2","7 July 2000"," thrilling action - great stunts - keep you on edge of your seat and entertained the entire movie
","Brilliant Entertainment.  Unbelievable stunts.  Keep you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end.  Few boring moments.  Makes you think of a high tech James Bond, mixed with a little MacGyver.  I really enjoyed this one! Perhaps it has a little to do with the Cruise charm as well.  Great directing by Woo as well."
"cobretti","9","1","2","7 July 2000"," not very down to earth but great entertainment
","I went to see this movie yesterday having quite high expectations - which were not disappointed. Of course Tom Cruise's character is somehow ""larger than life"" just like Rambo and there are scenes that just couldn't work (for example, when he kicks the gun lying in the sand and it flies directly into his hand) But after all this was an highly entertaining and thrilling flick with loads of brilliantly choreographed action sequences - typical for John Woo. So if you liked Face/Off you'll love this one. By the way, this second installment has nothing to do with the original - so don't care about seeing first one before watching M: I-2 in case you missed it. Go see it, it's worth the effort."
"Budd-5","1","1","2","8 July 2000"," A Patience Tester!
","Mission: Impossible 2 fails in almost every aspect. It is a run of the mill action flick not a Mission Impossible movie. A Mission Impossible film has to have twists galore; surprises that don't make sense; a plot that nobody understands. Kudos to Brian De Palma. He got the genre spot on with Mission: Impossible and he was then able to flex his action biceps with the terrific train sequence and the awe-inspiring entry into the security vault. There was a romantic element to his movie also but it was always a supporting character. It aided but did not interfere with the spy movie.<br/><br/>M:I2 wasn't even a spy movie. It was a romance first and an action movie second. The romance was destroyed by the weak nature of Thandie Newton's character. Though she began the movie as a superior thief, she quickly was reduced to no more than a damsel for Tom Cruise to heroically save.<br/><br/>The action was also inferior to De Palma's version. Frankly, John Woo bores me. His incessant slow-motion shots were tiresome and what is his obsession with pigeons? The teaser before the credits was well done as was the rock-climbing sequence but the car chase and the overlong motor-race cum fight was to put it bluntly boring.<br/><br/>Who cares if Cruise did all his own stunts? There weren't that many to do in the first place. I'm not bitter towards Cruise, in fact he is possibly my favourite actor when he is in a worthy movie (EYES WIDE SHUT), however this movie reaks of his interference as producer and if he did greatly interfere then his own vanity may have destroyed what could have been a successful franchise."

","We liked this sequel more than MI-1.  It was so fast, sexy, intense, creative (THE STUNTS!) and full of action it would be worth seeing again because we know things got missed.<br/><br/>The Stunts alone are worth it.  How they do all that is amazing. Combinations of Matrix and other movies.  All done to perfection and Edited with crisp style and smooth too.  John Woo at his best.<br/><br/>Not a very new story but some new twists on how Bio-engineering and Germ Warfare could lead to.  Tom was great and everyone else played their parts very well too.  Anthony Hopkins was good but under-used. <br/><br/>
Chemistry was good enough to make Nicole take a second look but Tom is still her man.<br/><br/>Recommend you see it."

","I am surprised that not many people like this film, I, for one, really enjoyed it and it entertained me thoroughly. Don't get me wrong, there are faults, including a pretty lousy script, but all in all, Mission: Impossible II makes up for the disastrous original film.<br/><br/>Thandie Newton is mezmerising as a thief who goes on a mission with Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) to stop her old boyfriend (Dougray Scott) blowing up buildings. The script is hard to explain really, as I said, the story is pretty lousy...but I totally recommend this awesome flick if you're looking for a sexy, action packed, thrill ride of a film.<br/><br/>Mission: Impossible II is #115 on My Top 150 Films Of All Time.<br/><br/>My Rating: 8/10."

","This is one of the few sequels that I have seen that has superseded the first by such a major margin.  There was the patented John Woo dramatics, but that did nothing but accentuate the theatric effect of the movie. There were a couple of oops moments but with the amount of special effects in this movie, John Woo showed his attention to detail, by cutting them all out. A definite should see in my books."

The plot was thin, and has been done (to death!!!) much better. (In fact, the plot is basically the same as Broken Arrow w/ a few tweaks.) The movie relies too heavily on special effects and even those become tiresome.<br/><br/>The big draw here is Tom Cruise...and that's just not enough!<br/><br/>My suggestion?  Rent Broken Arrow and stay at home!"

"JohnnyPHreak","8","1","2","26 June 2000"," If You Haven't Seen It, What Are You Doing Reading This
","There are no words to explain how much this film rocks. This films clearly establishes John Woo as the premiere action film director today. Add this to a list of amazing films that include The Killer, Hard Boiled and Face/Off. I loved the first film for it being a different kind of spy film. It's an adventure-thriller that is pointed more toward the spy world than the action world. Any one who liked the MI will love this. At first I didn't believe that Tom Cruise could pull off the action hero but he total flipped me for a loop. By the end of the film I was like ""Yeah Tom!"" It without a doubt gets a 9.57 in my book. The 2nd best film of the summer behind Shaft. If you haven't seen it yet, what are you doing reading this, get out of your chair and catch this film. It is well worth the $8.50 and you'll be kicking yourself if you miss it in the cinemas."

","Caveat: I love John Woo's films. And this is definitely a John Woo film. Woo can do more with fewer words than any director I know, and in Cruise, Scott, and Newton, much of his cast do a marvelous job of acting without having to speak. Not that the script itself is anything shabby - cute, at times witty. Good for more than enough chuckles.<br/><br/>This movie has cool, it has style, and what's more, there's an actual heart to it. Cruise's Hunt suffers - there is doubt in what he's doing, and a lack of faith that portrays itself much more in what he doesn't say, and how he doesn't, than what he does.  This is what Bond movies should have been for a while now."

","Mission impossible 2 is one of the first action flicks that I can actually take younger children to.

(we do not all say g'day mate, bloke etc and live on a desert sheep ranch just outside Sydney!)<br/><br/>But overall its a great movie, and the cinematography  is some of the best I have ever seen.

I go to the movies to enjoy the hard work that the cast and crew put into their films. This is one of those such films. I will openly admit that I have not liked all of the films that Tom Cruise has done. To be honest I wanted to see Shanghai Noon the day I saw MI:2. But as soon as I sat down and the movie started I was quickly on the edge of my seat. For I will have to say that this is definitely the best Movie I have ever seen Cruise in.<br/><br/>I thought this one was much better than the first. I thought the first one was a little too dark and gloomy. I actually found myself not able to take my eyes off of Cruise and Scott.This is only the second film I have seen Scott in.

","I'm so very tired of hearing how people are comparing this movie to the first.  There are so many elements that make each film great in their own ways, but we have to realize that the films are made in different styles. ""Mission: Impossible 2"" tries to create more for the characters and the physical action, not exactly the storyline.  I do admit that the strength of the story barely held the film together, but the action was incredible. This film was made to satisfy the newer generation...a mindless one even. So, if you like a true mission impossible, this movie will not be the one for you.  If you're looking for a hell of a time watching nothing but explosions, you've got your movie."

I figure that I've invested my time in a film and that I should stick it out until the bitter end.  In 30 years of watching movies, I never, NEVER walked out of a theater...that is, until I went to see MI-2.<br/><br/>MI-2 is, by far, the worst film ever made.  As soon as I saw ""Directed by John Woo"", I knew that I was in for something bad.  This movie is shockingly bad.  Woo cut his teeth in the Hong Kong Cinema making ultra-violent films like Hard Boiled and The Killer.  His films in Hong Kong and in America are riddled with ridiculous caricatures, cliche-ridden dialogue and mind-numbing camera tricks.  I believe he is in love with slow motion.  As a matter of fact, when I saw Woo's name in the credits, I decided to count the number of times he used slow motion...after all, the movie itself wouldn't be worth watching.  By the time I walked out (I COULDN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE!!!), which was during the fight scene that seemed to last for about 45 minutes, I counted 48 different uses of slow motion.  Watch the cable run out of the winch...in slow motion!  Watch Tom Cruise walk...in slow motion!!  Watch the bad guys shoot a million rounds of ammo and hit nothing...in slow motion!!!<br/><br/>The problem is that, because the movie has done so well at the box office, we're going to get years of this type of garbage.  That is why John Woo must be stopped!!!<br/><br/>Did I mention this was the worst film ever made???"
"morganf1","1","1","2","9 June 2000"," Was this a comedy?
","I think it must have been, because so many parts of it were quite laughable. The numerous fight/chase scenes were shamelessly overdone, the scripting was awful, the plot was nonexistent, and there was more gratuitous use of slow motion than a Jerry Bruckheimer film.  Not only did the movie seem to drag on forever, but it actually managed to get much worse as it progressed. I noticed that the antagonist's Irish accent got much thicker as the movie went on.  And surprisingly, there weren't any nifty gadgets as there should be in a spy movie.  This insult to one's intelligence is definitely down there with Armageddon and Star Wars Episode I as one of the worst movies in recent years and is certainly a contender for this year's Golden Raspberry award."

","Absolute formula-Woo - too many slow motion shots, too many pigeons.  The only saving grace were the bikes (I am partial to Triumph's, best riding machines built). I think this movie requires quite a big suspension of disbelief among action movie buffs; the violence is at times too 'cartoon-ish', in a 'Con Air' kind of mode.  Woo resorts to his good-guy/bad-guy showdown before the credits roll like he did with 'Broken Arrow' and 'Face Off'.  The man is getting predictable, which is a polite way of saying he's downright boring these days. I felt cheated of the $9.00 I spent seeing this film, which is nothing more than a travelogue for Sydney and New South Wales. I predict that Tom Cruise and John Travolta will have their work cut out for them drawing fans in the next ten years."

"kylezombie","10","1","2","31 May 2000"," Better than everyone says
","Where does it say that a movie should be judged by comparing it to a previous movie?  MI:2 wasn't like the original movie, but that in no way is a bad thing.  Mission Impossible was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The dialogue was laughably bad- ""Asta Lasagna, don't get any on ya."" And, if you didn't understand the plot the first time you saw it, then you have no right to critique any film.  I find it hard to believe that anyone under the age of 10 didn't understand what was going on.  Those are probably the same people that are saying how bad the sequel was. Mission Impossible: 2 was designed to be an implausible movie.  Of course there were unbelievable stunts, like when Ethan did a back-flip while running forward.  But that was the point!  It was supposed to be a bunch of crazy stunts.  No one ever questions the fact that James Bond dives off a cliff after a falling plane, or when Arnold lifts up an incredibly huge gun after getting shot in the shoulder!  It's supposed to be mindless action. Do you really think that John Woo thought the motorcycle chase was 100% realistic? Everyone is complaining about the fact that Cruise and Newton fell in love after one night.  Is this the FIRST time we've seen this in a movie?!  Of course not!  Did anyone question that whole fact in Titanic?  That whole movie was based on the fact that two people can fall in love immediately, and it is the most popular movie of all time.  Why doesn't everybody lash out at James Cameron because HIS movie was unrealistic? Anthony Hopkins' role in the film was most probably a volunteer job.  Lots of actors like to volunteer for a movie that they would really like to be in, without being credited.  Emilio Estevez wasn't credited for his role in the first Mission Impossible.  It happens a lot more than people realize. Plus, Hopkins gets to give one of the coolest lines in the film, ""This isn't Mission: Difficult, Mr. Hunt, it's Mission: Impossible.  Difficult should be a walk in the park for you."" A lot of people were saying that Ving Rhames didn't have a big enough role. Did you even see the movie?  I've seen it twice now, and he's in it the whole time! I don't understand why people can't just sit back and enjoy movies these days.  John Woo has come out with another winner, and I will continue to enjoy his films.  I recommend that everyone go see Mission: Impossible 2, because it has a clever plot, good performances, and unbelievable action."
"Manda-13","2","1","2","30 May 2000"," Scooby Doo revisited
","I went into Mission Impossible 2 without too many expectations. I saw the first film and thoroughly enjoyed it. I figured I could expect much of the same from the sequel. Well, I was wrong...very wrong. I was at least expecting a plot, but, alas, there was none. The poor excuse for a plot is that there is an ""evil"" man ready to set a devastating disease loose on all mankind and Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), along with the requisite beautiful partner find the source of the disease and bring a living sample of it back to Anthony Hopkins (he is only in the movie for about 8 minutes total, so I don't remember his character's  name). I was turned off by the time the opening credits rolled. The film opens with a man speaking in an indistinguishable accent, so I had no idea what he was saying. But I had many opportunities to try to figure it out since they replayed the monologue 3 times throughout the run of the film (for no real reason). Then we are faced with a plane being hijacked, and then we zoom to Tom Cruise hanging from his fingertips off the egde of a cliff while the opening credits rolled. I truly believe the only real reason behind this movie is to make Tom Cruise look ""cool"". John Woo was certainly the right director to go to for this, since he is known for his use of slo-mo, and penchant for symbolism in his films. The only real reason to see MI2 is to see Tom Cruise. Period.<br/><br/>MI2 is bound to disappoint many. It's not a real action film, because there is very little action, and it's not a drama, because the characters are not developed at all: Ethan Hunt=good, Sean Ambrose=bad, Nyah=sexy. That's another annoyance. Thandie Newton is a talented actress, but here, she is reduced to basically being a Bond girl, her estrogen used as a plot device. And, finally , speaking of plot devices, the overuse of the mask f/x is extremely tiring. Give us a break Mr. Woo! We all saw FaceOff, it's a cool effect the first 20 times we see it. After that, it's a ridiculous parody of itself, a la Scooby -Doo cartoons,  that insults the audience. At one crucial point in the movie, it's obvious to everyone that a mask is being worn by one of the characters because it had been used 7 times prior to that in the movie. Yet, we are supposed to be shocked by the ultimate revelation...sloppy filmmaking, to say the least. All in all, I gave MI2 a 2. It was silly, overwrought, and campy in it's own way. Go see it if you must (and I know most of you must), but take heed...you may have a hankering for Scooby snacks by the time you leave."

I enjoyed the movie, I was looking to see an adrenaline rushing guy flick and this movie fit the bill. If you are looking to over-analyze a film plot or movie believability, I wouldn't waste my time with MI-2.<br/><br/>

"behemuthm","1","1","2","25 May 2000"," John Woo Fails Again
","If you didn't enjoy Broken Arrow for its terrible direction, be braced for worse in Woo's latest attempt Mission Impossible 2. I thought the first installment of the two was okay, but as is the case more often than not, the sequel turns out worse. More than anything, Woo's style of slow-motion and extreme-angle shots would be cool if it wasn't taken too seriously. The music is way over the top (read: big music rise when man grabs a scarf...). The sound effects editing is equally as bad (a woman slaps a man in the face and it sounds like a 70s kung-fu kick). It would be fair to say that if you removed all of the slow-motion scenes in this movie, it'd be about 35 minutes long. However, Scooby-Doo fans will appreciate Woo's obvious tribute to lame plot-twists. This film is basically an excuse to show Cruise with wind blowing in his hair with a little smirk behind dark glasses (Matrix, anyone?). I don't care how many freakin' Kung Fu movies this guy's made: Every American film he's been involved in has sucked bigtime: Broken Arrow, The Rock, Face/Off, and most notably: Hard Target (poo!). Don't get me wrong: I wasn't expecting Shakespeare here...but there's no law stating that if you make an action movie, it has to be really unintelligent. Look at the original Bond films, for example. This has never happened to me before, but about twenty minutes in, I felt like I was in a movie theater, not involved in the story. I had to try to keep focusing on the screen and try to get into it, but I just couldn't. So in conclusion, if you like to be insulted as an audience member or feel like staring at a 40-foot-wide slow-motion extreme low-angle of Tom Cruise trying to be cool or acting tough, you're sure to get your eight dollars' worth. Oh yeah, an abundance of big explosions from three hundred different angles. Yawn."
"Noodles-34","1","1","2","28 May 2000"," Horrible!
","Call it what you will, this film was TASTELESS! Not only was the bad guy a mix between Scottish, Russian, British, and German, but the violence! Personally I belive John Woo should have cut down on the shooting and booming things to Hell, but thats him. being a Chinatown Yakuza influencial, his style of ""action"" took over the orginality and essence of Mission:Impossible. His direction towards Tom Cruise to have him do Kartae and such, really was disgusting and i think should have been deleted for completely obvious reasons. (email me if you want to know them) Having seen the old B&W samurai battle films made in Japan during and after the war, I can tell you, Woo ripped off th endings of them. The duels between the good and bad guys on the beaches, PLUS having the ""Karate"" of some sort stuck in there. he also took the same music from Gladiator to express humanism, which obviously DID NOT WORK. The parts that I did like though, were the spy tactics Cruise used to infiltrate the building and the technology used throughout the film. The car chase scenes really did not work out for me at all. The cast was fine, nothing wrong there. Dialouge was fine, setting was really cool, that I liked--Australia! And where  the crap did those guards come out of in the building scene? I really thought this film was a waste of my time and money. I do not recommend it to anyone interested."

Besides the highly publicized mountain climbing scene and a car chase, nothing much happens in the way of action for over an hour.  By the time the action does start, it's too little too late.  People change faces more times than Michael Jackson.  But you can usually figure out who it really is before they reveal themselves.  During the movie, an alarm went off in the theater.  I felt a strange peace settle over me, thinking it would be better to die in a fiery blaze then watch the rest of this movie but, alas, I was forced to suffer through the rest of this debacle.  If you sped up John Woos signature slow motion to real time, the movie would be about 30 minutes shorter and, not so coincidentally, the movie is about 30 minutes too long.  The special effects are good but, as we learned from terrible movies like ""Wild Wild West"" and ""Battlefield Earth"", you need more than special effects to carry a movie.  If you see one action movie this summer, make it the incredibly funny and entertaining ""Shanghai Noon"", not ""Mission Impossible 2""."
"volkris","1","1","2","26 May 2000"," Pretty bad, complete departure from Mission Impossible
","This movie was pretty bad. The complex and twisting, yet plausable plots and neet-o gadgets that are the hallmark of Mission Impossible were nowhere to be found in this movie. It seemed to be simply another action movie that had stolen the title ""Mission Impossible"" and that little theme song. The brief characterizations behind the team members that are present in the TV show weren't even done here, and the special effects weren't even that great by today's standards.<br/><br/>I would not recommend this movie to anyone, and would particularly not recommend it to anyone who liked the TV show or even the last movie as it simply wasn't Mission Impossible, but just another plotless, cookie cutter action film that just happened to have that title."
"sorcerer-11","1","1","2","25 May 2000"," Film is poor M:I entry, and bad among all action films.
","Other than a few crudely implanted trademarks, this film in no way belongs to the Mission Impossible genre. It's nothing more than a weak Tom Cruise vehicle.  Other ""team members"" are barely a support cast.  There's none of the cleverly timed interaction that defines Mission Impossible.  To make things worse, the first 100 minutes of the movie is nothing other than a series of boring dragged-out implausibilities.  Woo expects us to be entertained by over-milked eye-candy.  But the ""icing"" isn't sweet enough to compensate for the lack of ""cake""."

The actress is very sexy and seems like she has some acting talent. I am one of the few people who really enjoyed the first Mission Impossible. This is one of Tom Cruise's worst films.

","After audience's complained about the complexity of the first film, they made this film so easy to follow, (to the point of being contrived!) that a three year old child could have understood it, such is the plot outline and structure of this film!<br/><br/>O.k. We have Tom Cruise, sending out 'I am God' signals throughout the film. I can take it. Then we have John Woo's trademark slo-mo sequences, amazing stunts, and of course white doves! I can take it. We have a gorgeous leading lady - Thandie Newton, who captures Ethan Hunt's (Cruise) heart. I can take it. And not forgetting the wonderful Dougray Scott as the villain of the piece. I can take it.<br/><br/>I can take it all. But the plot man, the plot is soooooooo pathetically doctored, it's a kind of a slap in the face. It's insulting! At least the first film made it's audience's think throughout. Who really suspected Jon Voight would be involved in the original? You can figure out the ending to this film in the opening 10 minutes!<br/><br/>Mind you, after saying that, this film is VERY entertaining! (provided you leave approximately 90% of your brain outside as you watch it!) This is first and above all, a popcorn film. That's the simple solution. It's a summer blockbuster, and what better way to get bums on seats than to combine the star appeal of Cruise and the explosive set pieces and direction of Woo?! You have to admit, the combo worked!<br/><br/>Watching this film though, I can't help but think about what Dougray Scott did to his career - he turned down the part of Wolverine in X-Men to do this film. Just makes you wonder, but that's a different story isn't it...?<br/><br/>The final climactic scrap between the hero and the villain is well choreographed and for a minute, I thought that Scott's villain could win, but hey, ain't no-one gonna beat Cruise is there? Nope. Predictable? Yep!<br/><br/>I give this film a 8/10 - I've been generous, I know, but the script, and the plot could have been refined somewhat, but hey, that's Hollywood for you eh?!<br/><br/>Enjoy!"

The first film was interesting, it took 2 viewings to comprehend the complicated plot, but it laid the foundation to build a successful franchise. Although Tom Cruise was the focus of the story, I thought the next one would bring in the team and it would become a team film - I was WRONG!<br/><br/>There's not much to praise here, John Woo is in sleep mode, his action sequences are plain boring, it's been done and done to death. Woo is so much better when he's making films in Hong Kong. This is Hollywood drivel from Woo. His trademarks takeover the film, this makes him the wrong choice, because the story is in the background. Someone like Donner can tell anyone's story, an auteur like Woo can't because his reputation is built on his specific style.<br/><br/>The acting is boring and tedious, Thandie Newton is totally miscast. The Love story is pathetic, I was cringing!

I thought you were looking for a non stop action film. In my movie shelf this is one of the best ones. On DVD the sound is outstanding, the rockclimbing scene is awesome.<br/><br/> The beginning of the movie is a bit hokey though, especially the tap dancing part. Another cheesy part is when Ethan and Nyah all of the sudden fall in love.<br/><br/> When the mission starts, the great stuff starts. The thing I thought we were looking for, the action. The action is as great on DVD as it is on the big screen. So if you're looking for a movie that has great action, pick up MI-2 at the movie store on DVD if you have DVD. It has a simple plot.

John Woo zooms in on his face then tells him from behind the camera 'yes look mean, really mean, like you did not get your cereals this morning'. And then gives the viewer, what seems like 2 minutes to admire an 'angry' looking Tom Cruise.<br/><br/>Besides from the bad acting, the director should stick to video clips. He uses slowmotion at silly moments in the movie, only for effect. Then he uses the some 'face off' faces in this film as in face-off. And the action scenes slow-motion/the matrix/kung fool, have been done enough now. The ending scene with the 15 minute chase on the motorbike is sleep provoking.<br/><br/>The romantic interest is build up by a teenager, you never feel there was any 'magic' between the characters, it's just a 'sex-interest'.

But I finally dragged myself to theater to see it and was blown away. The acting was 100% better then the first, the story was easy to believe in today's society, and a good story at that.  The action as well as the dramatic and love scenes were very well shot. The writing was good and let you get to know the characters so well that you could almost believe this was a true story. I think the fact that Tom Cruise did his own stunts made you want to like this movie because of the effort it must have taken. Dougray Scott is the man for the job as his character `Sean Ambrose' no one could have done better, the chemistry between Sean and Ethan is incredible, as well is the chemistry between Ethan Hunt (Crusie) and Nyah Hall (Thandie Knewton) they both light up the screen with their performances.  Some people say that this movie was too predictable and didn't keep people guessing but me and a lot of people I know disagree. This movie will keep you biting your nails and completely still as you see the action sequences. This movie brought me back to the theatre 5 more times. I gave it a 10 of 10.

"Auselan","9","2","9","18 July 2001"," A unique work of art
","Mission Impossible 2 was not appreciated by the critics because it was not understood by them.  As the culmination of the action epic - where the symmetry, usually found in poetry, is embodied by the violence - most modern cinema-goers were faced with something wholly new.  The Western intelligentsia, still hung up on the 1960's false division of clever female creativity from brute male violence, could not appreciate the profundity and happy sanity which John Woo's action engenders.<br/><br/>The film opens with a panoramic view of the Moab dessert in Utah, before slowly focusing in on the small pinprick of activity which turns out to be Ethan Hunt (Cruise).  As he struggles with the hot sandy surface of the perilous cliff face, one of the film's main themes is introduced: man's struggle to overcome fire and earth.  Fire and earth being, since Biblical times, symbols of desire, pain and, ultimately, procreation.  Yet the theme is not gendered: sometimes it is male, sometimes female.  The violence of the Spanish dancers, dressed in red with their viciously clicking heels and aggressively sharp  though elegant  movements, celebrate feminine strength and sexuality.  As Naya executes her robbery, the clacking of her heels on the stairs and her sudden pose against the wall mimics the actions of the Spanish dance, thus her union with Tom Cruise on the cliff face, as their two cars, pinned together, pirouette towards dusty death, unifies the creative energy of the feminine Spanish dance with that of masculine danger. They become lovers.<br/><br/>Hunt is obliged by his master' to give her up  to pimp her  and thereby entrap the villain.  At this point, the theme of fire and earth mutates as the pain, rather than the desire of its fecundity is explored.  This is visually conveyed by the horse image which begins to dominate  quantitatively and as well as qualitatively  over the earth image.  Naya is described by the villain, Ambrose, as a possible Trojan horse'  referring to the danger lurking behind her desirability  and the next scene is of horse-hooves churning up the race-track: a sinister mutation of the rumbling castanets and clacking heels of the flirtatious Spanish dance scene.  Naya becomes a pawn as the film delves deeper into violence, and eroticism becomes secondary or is subsumed into the beauty of explosive male confrontation.  Naya becomes less important while the arch enemy, Ambrose, becomes more so.  There is nothing salacious about this substitution of a female for a male combatant on the part of Hunt: a Freudian interpretation, while being a valid exercise in risky thinking, adds nothing to our understanding.  Instead of the tender mating ritual of the car chase, we have the bitter sparring ritual of the motorcycle chase: the two are similar in that they involve danger and heightened passions.<br/><br/>The full-frontal motorcycle confrontation is the culmination of the horse image: it is a modern day joust, where the horses have become machines. The animal of the horse is civilized or contained within the sphere of technology, just as the film  with all its technological innovation  masters and is able to express through it's artistry otherwise uncontrollable inexpressible forces.  Like the Spanish dance and the car chase with Naya, Hunt's action scenes have a primal, yet also cosmic, elegance.  When he is kicking his gun from the sand with a sharp tap-dancing manoeuvre, pirouetting on the wheel of a motorcycle, or spinning away from gun-fire amidst exploding glass and red flames, the paradoxical creativity of violence is suggested.  Explosions occur and the camera pans out to afford a view of their blast radius, dwelling upon  and thereby suggesting the beauty of  these scenes of chemical destruction.  John Woo, through these explosive images, reminiscent of the origin of the universe (the big bang) is thus able to suggest one of the central paradoxes of creation: how life and creativity began in violence."

With the likes of A Better Tomorrow, The Killer and Hard Boiled, produced in his native Hong Kong, he had earned his reputation as an action maestro, one capable of delivering a gun-fight with balletic grace, almost like watching poetry in motion. His Hollywood career started off okay with Hard Target and Broken Arrow, two forgettable if sufficiently entertaining vehicles for Jean-Claude Van Damme and John Travolta. He went up a couple of gears in 1997 with Face/Off, an outrageous thriller with two off-the-leash central performances, and it felt like Woo had finally worked out the formula of translating his chaotic brand of action and humour for American audiences. That was all before Tom Cruise suggested him for the follow-up to Brian De Palma's nifty thriller Mission: Impossible. M:I-2, as the posters branded it, not only manages to be completely hollow, but incredibly boring.<br/><br/>While De Palma made some controversial changes to the formula of the original TV series, the first Mission: Impossible still embraced much of what was loved about it. It was grounded in a world of espionage and secret government departments, with Tom Cruise's relatively inexperienced Ethan Hunt at the centre of the unravelling plot. Woo throws the majority of this out of the window in favour of something more flashy and violent, changing Hunt from an opportunistic rookie to a leather-jacket wearing superhero capable of gravity-defying kicks and physics-defying driving. When we first meet him, he's free-climbing in Utah, in what is the movie's only heart-pounding moment. It establishes this new Hunt as a fearless adrenaline-junkie, and when he finally makes it to the top, he is handed his next mission, should he choose to accept it, via a pair of soon-to-be self-destructed sunglasses. The mission is to track down and retrieve a deadly virus stolen by rogue IMF agent Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott). To assist him, Hunt must also recruit professional thief Nyah Hall (Thandie Newton), who also happens to be a former flame of Ambrose.<br/><br/>After the baffling plot of the first Mission: Impossible, it's something of a relief that Woo chose to keep things as simple as they are here. With films like this, the story only really serves as a way to get us to the next set-piece. The major issue is that Woo and writer Robert Towne (of The Last Detail and Chinatown fame) fail to inject any life into their characters, or at least give us anyone to root for. I like Tom Cruise and have nothing but respect for his desire to do all of his own stunts, but this smirking, floppy-haired version of Ethan Hunt comes across as a bargain-bin James Bond. Dougray Scott, who is one of the blandest actors around anyway, isn't helped by his one-note villain. Ambrose is simply an evil version of Hunt, only without the hero's plot armour. By the time Ving Rhames and John Polson are brought in for the final showdown, it's all too little, too late. By this time, Mission: Impossible II has already established Hunt as a one-man army, who naturally finds the time to romance his prettiest recruit when she's not busy trying to run him off a cliff. All of this could be forgiven if the action was on point. Guns are pointed dramatically and the camera swirls in slow-motion, but not even the obligatory flying doves can save M:I-2 from yawn-inducing mediocrity. It was a smash-hit at the box-office, but it's reputation meant that it would take six years for J.J. Abrams to save the franchise from an early demise."

","""Mission Impossible II"" did _not_ stand the jump from big to small screen. It's one of those movies that puts the chapter-skip button to use. When the guns are holstered, it's a real drag, and that's really the best way to describe this movie. Thandie Newton's subplot just doesn't work, and you find yourself wanting to move ahead to the next action scene. Speaking for myself, that is.<br/><br/>To that end, if you have the patience to sit through the melodrama, there's a real charge to the gunfights. The tactical precision of the first film has been replace by dual-wielded Berettas; and it's fun, even today. Using your motorcycle sideview to shoot the guy behind you? That's total John Woo! The man left his mark on the franchise, to be sure - it's just a shame it had to be with such a dull script.<br/><br/>4/10"

","The movie has no plot, some people think the movie actually has a plot, it does not, its much like classic seventies porn having endless lame justification for action, what drives the action is meritless. Much like some old porn movie, its not realistic, but it just invents something very lame to get naked and do some action. This movie is no different than a lame porn movie, except most lame porn movies have better plots than Mission Impossible Two. <br/><br/>The movie is packed full of action, each action scene is very visually beautiful, however each action scene is nothing more than a plagiaristic cliché from just about every action movie that had any merit. The movie has the creative insight of a turnip or some other vegetable, that has no proved creative insight. It is artistic, however plagiaristic clichés. Sadly most people do not know the difference from creative masterpieces,and copy cats who merely duplicate other men's work."
"Jona1988","5","1","3","8 January 2012"," Mildly entertaining action and stupid plot
","When people arrived at the cinema for this movie I imagine the film crew stood at the entrance saying something like ""Welcome in for this screening of MI2 but please leave your brain outside"". Well symbolically speaking but that really describes this movie. I heard several saying that the plot of the first movie is so hard to understand and I can agree somewhat. It took me a few viewings to follow it completely but it's really not that sophisticated one then realises. Well anyway seeing the sequel one wonders if the producers said something like ""So people thought the plot of the first was complicated so lets just disregard any story for the sequel"". I'm not against mindless action movies, sometimes it's really comfortable to just lean back and not think a lot but just enjoy. However if find myself not being able to suspend my disbelief here because MI2 is not simple but rather completely stupid, treating it's viewers as retards. According to the trivia on IMDb the screenwriter claims he wrote the story around action scenes that John Woo had thought out. It must be true! Many of the action scenes come out of nowhere whatsoever. I go like what the hell is going on with the story? Not in a way that I don't understand but that you understand to well that is makes less sense than a Donald Duck cartoon. It goes so far as one scene Ving Rhames close to turns to the audience and clearly explains what is happening now, why they have to do this thing. Who does the filmmaker think the viewers are? Even underaged would see this as ridiculously easy. The actors play the typical stereotype one expects form this kind of mindless action movie, the hero is so cool and the villain is evil in every way. I'm no hater of Tom Cruise because I can distinguish between his work and him in private which I mostly try to ignore, he seems to be quite a weird guy. Dougray Scott is well enough as the villain and it feels somewhat too bad his career never took off. Thandie Newton has no other purpose than looking hot. The style of the movie is just like you expect from John Woo but actually even more extreme of every of his trademarks. You won't get action more over the top than this. It's looks good but the first film wasn't even near this type so this doesn't quite feel like a sequel, had they just changed the names one wouldn't even know. So the action is good but it's just too much. Not even James Bond would get away with this, don't get me wrong I love the 007 movies. Add so much cheesy dialogue and dramatic music and I'm somehow embarrassed when I once watched this with someone that knew nothing about Mission: Impossible. The action is great but Mission: Impossible 2 goes from simple to insultingly dumb. Sorry I can't take this movie, it barely passes for the acceptable grad which on my scale is 5/10."

","A secret agent is sent to Sydney, to find and destroy a genetically modified disease called ""Chimera""<br/><br/>Now, if you've read the review for the original, I loved the movie. It felt like a REAL spy film, where everything is so secretive like and so 'code-named.' For this reason, the second film seemed to set my standards. But folks, I highly suggest skipping this film and watch the 3rd because the movie was so unexplained, so pointless, so bad... Now, don't take me the wrong way, I don't believe the film is the worst thing out there. I have seen much worse, much better, but this film sets out to be one of the worst scenes out there. In the beginning, I thought the movie was unavailing pretty okay; all changing when he sets out to find the girl. The following, say, 45 minutes is a relationship status with Tom Cruise. They pointlessly drive in cars and crash each other until they go home and have sex. So... stupid. The way they inserted the action scenes was beyond me, they were so pointless and flaw...full. The second half, thankfully, had some redeeming qualities. The only I could find is the action and special effects, everything else was just horrible. Sadly, I found myself waiting for the movie to be over and watch the 3rd but I forced myself to see anything new. The acting, yeah, was pretty bad too. Tom Cruise is really not the most likable character in his films, and in this one, he just fails in multiple levels (thankfully succeeding in the 3rd.) Now when there seems to be nothing else to complain about, we have the score. Wait... I'm complaining about the score? Yeah. I was surprised to see that my favorite composer, Hans Zimmer, constructed this disaster. They ruined the theme, one, by redoing it with a guitar. Sounds pretty cool, but sounds pretty not. Then the rest of the film has this (I'm trying to find the word) Hispanic (?) soundtrack. The film is a disgrace to the Mission Impossible films. I suggest not seeing this, ever, even if your extremely bored, with friends. The movie will surely make you want to weep for humanity. That bad. 3/10."
"fatehsmann","6","1","3","16 December 2010"," No substance, and not too much style either
","For all the hype, the marketing, and the trailers and Tom Cruise, this movie fell flat on its face. Nothing in this movie is bad though. The effects and the action sequences are okay, though nowhere near to the level expected. The performances are okay, though Tom Cruise fails to bring about the kind of performance that would have catapulted him among the legends. This was the kind of role that would have shown,(as Thandie Newton said during the movie), that he's not just a pretty face, similar to what Brad Pitt did with his mind-blowing portrayal of Tyler Durdan. But it's not Cruise's fault.The plot and everything is average and the movie tends to drag and it has a lackluster feel in it. Forget substance, even the special effects and the action sequences are no where near the level you would expect. Ethan Hunt never really looks like a super spy. And you're never really at the edge of your seat. There are far far better movies out there..go for something else."
"mjneu59","5","1","3","7 December 2010"," certainly diverting, in an empty sort of way
","The second entry in what promises to be a reliable series of action-packed blockbuster diversions is, for better or worse, pure popcorn: an adrenalin-driven, quintessential summertime crowd pleaser. The franchise at the time showed none of the formula staleness of its obvious role model, the James Bond adventures, despite sharing the same exotic international settings, the same megalomaniac villains, and the same beautiful, willing bedmates. Plus (of course) a similar superspy hero, played by producer Tom Cruise, using the role to show off all his favorite hobbies: rock climbing, high-speed ballistic driving, designer sunglasses, and so forth.<br/><br/>Never mind the convoluted plot, which is just an excuse for an unlikely but exhilarating series of clockwork chases and cliffhanger stunts, the latter earning expatriate Hong Kong director John Woo a lot of praise for their balletic choreography (from people who, apparently, don't remember Sam Peckinpah). The film is surprisingly bloodless for having such an impressive body count, with all the colorful, comic book violence making it easy to enjoy, if almost impossible to recall in detail afterward.<br/><br/>Thandie Newton is the token love interest, and a capable foil to Cruise's strictly juvenile machismo, until the inevitable moment when she's reduced (almost on cue) to just another damsel in distress. And the typically glossy presentation will likely impress anyone with a weakness for high-tech gimmicks and gadgetry; if nothing else the film provided ample employment for the best technicians in Hollywood."
"lewiskendell","3","1","3","3 July 2010"," What should be impossible is making a movie this ridiculous.
","""Just stay alive. I'm not going to lose you.""<br/><br/>What was John Woo and Tom Cruise thinking? Or should I say, what were they smoking? How could they have not realized what a disaster they were involved in making? If I would have seen this at a theater, I don't know if I would have walked out after 15 minutes, or if I would have stayed just to see how much more absurd this thing could possibly get.<br/><br/>Mission Impossible 2 is nothing like the first movie or MI:3. For starters, those movies were actual good. The script for MI:2 was absolutely horrendous. We're expected to believe deep relationships exist between characters because they met, talked for all of 5 minutes, had a random car chase, and then immediately had sex. Some (most) of the dialogue was embarrassing to hear; I'm almost certain that it had to be just as embarrassing to say. Tom Cruise just grinned his way through the movie. Thandie Newton was completely wasted. The villain was too generic for me to even remember his name. The rest of the cast might as well not exist.  <br/><br/>John Woo went waaay overboard with ""stylistic"" flourishes that are so ridiculous that they were genuinely funny. I mean, some of the stunts and action set-pieces are just surreal versions of what a 10 year-old boy thinks would be cool. Pointless slow motion. Doves. More pointless slow motion. More doves. And yet, somehow the movie was still boring. It shouldn't be possible for a movie with this many explosions and shoot-outs and absurd scenarios to be dull, but they somehow pulled it off. I guess that counts as an accomplishment. Congratulations?<br/><br/>Mission Impossible 2 was just dreadful. It's not stylish, it's a cheesy, over-the-top in all the wrong ways, string of ridiculous, artistically empty scenes. It could have been campy fun if it would have been presented in a tongue-in-cheek manner, but Woo was dead serious about all this nonsense. Even the IMF couldn't salvage an enjoyable experience out of this mess."
"mnpollio","2","1","3","9 April 2010"," Laughably incompetent
","While I was not a fan of the initial overrated film adaptation of the popular TV series, the discovery that new director John Woo was taking over the helm made me decide to give this sequel a chance. Unfortunately, the end result is a laughably incompetent action film. Between this and the equally lamentable Broken Arrow, I am at a loss as to why Woo has any reputation in Hollywood. Tom Cruise returns as IMF agent Ethan Hunt, who matches wits with terrorist Dougray Scott who plans to release a biotoxin in Australia. Ving Rhames returns as Cruise's able-bodied co-hort and Thandie Newton is along for the ride as the token love interest - a cat burglar and former girlfriend to Scott. The screenplay is haphazardly plotted and not especially interesting or suspenseful. There are so many sequences of people ripping off their faces to reveal that they are in reality someone else completely that the effect long since loses any relevance. It also introduces a rather obvious issue that if the person you are impersonating looks to be 6'3"" and you look to be 5'6"" in height why does no one wonder why you have suddenly shrunk? Cruise spends the film glowering, showing off his athletic prowess by doing back flips at the drop of a hat and glaring intently at Newton in a desperate attempt to convince that they have chemistry. Although Scott seems a physical match for Cruise, he is one of the more boring villains in recent memory. Woo directs scenes between Newton/Cruise and Newton/Scott as though he were filming a Calvin Klein ad with endlessly arty filtered shots of blowing scarves and swirling images that nearly border on lampoon. His action scenes definitely qualify for lampoon with the adversaries flying through the air, smashing into solid objects at ridiculous speeds with nary an injury and assorted Road Runner-esqe foolishness that inspires far more titters than adrenaline. The end result is a laughably tedious exercise not worth anyone's time."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","6","1","3","2 January 2010"," I know why people want to hate this... and sadly, the complaints are sound
","The first was good as a spy thriller, and poor if considered to be related to the show. When this took such a different approach(heck, upon seeing this, some might have realized how great De Palma's attempt was), I can imagine many being disappointed to see it move further away from the series(I'm referring to the original one, which is what I understand to be the best times for this franchise). This is about what we expect from Woo. He does stylistic action really well, and is famous for his particular brand of it, with use of slow-motion that is so effective that he seriously schools anyone in Hollywood in that practice. At best, they can hope to be a pale imitation. He does, however, require something very important(I mean, apart from someone to tell him that, regardless of how awesome it looks... and it does, I'm not arguing that... agents do not, in fact, do over the top Kung Fu kicks and such). And that is a script. Oh, they had one. One written based around the exciting sequences that he wanted to do. Yeah. That's not a positive thing. The plot holes and continuity errors seem to be the result of the finished thing being cut down to almost half its initial length, but, let's be honest, this was never Face/Off. In place of drama and compelling characters, we get an Ethan Hunt that now just appears to be addicted to the rush, and who does insane stunts for *fun*. While the charm is still there somewhat, it's now about the only likable quality to him. You know, the *lead*. The rest of the cast aren't given many attractive traits, either. This also seriously needed to weed out the concept of using masks; for a bit of it, it literally comes off like every scene ends with someone revealing their true identity(typically only to the audience). That makes an otherwise *extremely* straightforward story excessively convoluted. The acting is reasonable, and the villain is cool enough. Editing and cinematography are well-done. The pacing is a letdown, probably mainly because this thing is not all that engaging. This has a well-composed score, and I personally like the new theme by Limp Bizkit, and fans of them most likely will, as well. For some reason, the music video on the DVD is a Metallica song instead. It has an informative director's commentary track(though he doesn't talk all the time, pity), a handful of well-done featurettes, an MTV parody(that I will review on its own page) and alternate opening credits. I recommend this to those into John and/or Tom's movies. 6/10"
"freemantle_uk","4","1","3","6 September 2009"," The weakest of the Series
","After the commercial success of Mission Impossible in 1996 it seemed that America had a spy film that could rival James Bond, and Hollywood being Hollywood, a sequel was inevitable. Here was a vehicle for Tom Cruise that had served him well. In Mission Impossible turned from a spy thriller to an completely out and out action extravaganza; but the film suffers for it.<br/><br/>The plot (what their is of it) is about a Russian scientist, Dr. Nekhorvich (Rade erbedija), a former agent of Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), injects him with a new supervirus Chimera, hoping to give it to the Americans along with the antidote. But ends up being murdered by former IMF Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) and crushes a commercial plane into the Rocky Mountains. Sean Ambrose plans to sell the virus to the bidder, with pharmaceutical companies and terrorist jobs the main bidders. It up to IMF and Ethan Hunt to do this. Ethan is required recruit theft Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton) to fake a relationship with Sean so they can find him.<br/><br/>The plot and story is too simple, too stupid and basically can't compare to either the first or third film. The dialogue is terrible, and the script is full of plot-holes. Non-American nationals are also treated in a stereotypical way and they so many needless actions scenes, like the car chase in Spain. What is really surprising is the writer for the film was Robert Towne, who wrote Mission Impossible and has an impressive filmography, like Chinatown and Bonnie and Clyde. It didn't even seem like a sequel to the first film because it style, story and just so many changes made in this film. John Woo was hired to direct. He is a man who is a talented action director, but he is a man who needs to work in Asia because his style is more suited to Hong Kong cinema. He is also a man who needs strong material or else his films fall flat. Most of his Hollywood efforts have been weak. There are some strengths; the action and the material arts are very well done, and properly some of best in the series. It is not overly edited or any shaky cam that affected the enjoyment of the second Bourne films. They is also a delicious amount of violence in the film. But even with the action scenes some area where so over the top it was ridiculous and John Woo really enjoyed using sparks to simulate bullets and enjoyed repeated shots of the same scene. There are some element's of Woo direction I liked. I did enjoy his trick of using classical music over action scene, but I do dislike the over use of slow motion.<br/><br/>Now to the acting. Tom Cruise seemed to be on autopilot in this film. His heart wasn't in it like it was in M:I and M:I III. They was a lack of chemistry with Thandie Newton and she is weak compared to her high standards. Dougray Scott was a decent villain, but he isn't as good as actors like Jon Voight, Kristian Scott Thomas and Philip Seymore Hoffman who enjoyed roles in the series. Scott had also suffered career wises, he was due to play Wolverine in X-Men but the film shot overshot and lost the part of Hugh Jackman and was in the running to be the next James Bond. Now Scott hasn't been in anything good for a long time. Ving Rhames, normally a very good actor, was really just comic fodder in this film. I also thought Australian actor John Polson was not good in this film.<br/><br/>They is excellent music by Hans Zimmer, who is one of the best composers in the movie industry at the moment.<br/><br/>Finally, the whole series is schizophrenic, neither knowing whether to be thriller based or action based or even what it's setting is going to be. Mission Impossible was set as a black ops division of the CIA (the best setting), M:I II, Ethan Hunt pretty much a lone agent for some sort of international group, and M:I III which IMF was an independence organisation. Some coincidence wouldn't go a miss.<br/><br/>** out of *****"

","I find it absolutely baffling how anyone could honestly find M:I-2 to be an awful film. One of my fondest memories of going to the movies was seeing this film back in 2000; it was a satisfying action film. This time around we saw Ethan Hunt as a man who really knew the ropes; his willingness to take risks (evident in the opening rock-climb sequence) showed contrast compared to the Ethan Hunt we knew from the first movie. I thought Dougray Scott was also awesome as Sean Ambrose, who was nearly a match for Ethan Hunt and always had really slick screen presence. The action scenes were totally engaging, and it felt awesome to watch them (emphasis on the motorcycle chase sequence), even if some of the stunts seemed impossible (#1 - Emphasis on Impossible. #2 - Isn't that why we go to the movies???). I know lots of people say there is not much of a plot, but I couldn't agree with that. I thought that the story around the Chimera virus was really intriguing, and it was neat seeing Brendan Gleeson involved in the whole plot line.<br/><br/>This is a film that really should not be taken too seriously; it's great for visual entertainment, and for that I got a bang for the buck. To dislike M:I-2 is perfectly understandable; it all depends on your own tastes and preferences-- but to absolutely hate M:I-2, that's really a little extreme.<br/><br/>Overall, M:I-2=awesome film in my books.

","Launched 4 years after the first movie of the same title, ""Mission Impossible 2"" is very superior to its predecessor. Maybe, it was a mistake to have hired Brian de Palma to the making. Indeed, the movie, in spite of good sequences was hard to maintain the spectator's attention due to a complicated screenplay.<br/><br/>Here, John Woo took over and he has done quite well. The complicated screenplay disappeared in favour of a more simple and traditional plot. But its characteristics gives an impression of ""déjà-vu"". From this impression, John Woo and his scriptwriters used subjects threadbare: to save the world from a threatening danger (here, it happens to be a virus called ""the Chimère""), to use an ancient mistress of the wicked's boss so as to get information. At last, the unavoidable duel between Tom Cruise and his enemy at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>Fortunately, the banality of the screenplay is compensated by a spectacular and meticulous making, especially the brisk chases. At least, it proves a thing, Woo is the specialist of action movies and knows perfectly his job. Obviously, it doesn't go without a few implausibilities.<br/><br/> ""Mission Impossible 2"" is a more entertaining movie than the first and where Tom Cruise doesn't play too much the Dom Juan.

By shooting in an audacious, fragmentary, ironic style; by alluding to a number of directors - Leone, Melville, Kubrick etc. - whose metier has been to undermine the ideal of the conventional action hero; by once again (after FACE/OFF) invoking Franju, inserting his famous white birds signifying madness at the precise moment  when Ethan 'Colin' Hunt is preparing to save the day; by associating the central triangle with earth, wind and fire, and leaving out water (Robert Towne, remember?), without which we would all die, Woo undermines the film's retrogressive assumptions, giving us a seriously compromised hero.  The colours are to die for.  Genius."

","Another summer blockbuster and a fine example of Tom Cruise's fat, bloated ego, exemplified by the various shots designed to show off how ""cool"" and ""sexy"" Cruise really is. Thankfully ditching the head-scratching plot of the first film, Woo and Cruise strive to create a James Bond-type feel to this action adventure, and ably succeed. While it's a lot easier to follow than Brian de Palma's 1996 hit, MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE II is frustratingly difficult to like, and happy to trot out cliché after uninspired cliché as its plot.<br/><br/>Action/Woo fans are also bound to be disappointed by the sheer lack of gunfights/battles/chases in this film as well. From the sheer spectacle of the dangerous cliff-hanging opening to the sickly sweet, sentimental ending, this film mostly fails to deliver the goods. The token car chase is done as gasp comedy, while the standard gun battle is over far too quickly and is also far less violent than in Woo's previous films - for a start, most of the deaths are off screen! The film only really comes into it's own with a stylish motorbike chase: it's fast, furious (and, as par for the course, totally outlandish), and also extremely thrilling, with plenty of explosions and stunts to keep the rubber burning and the octane pumping.<br/><br/>Aside from this spectacular finish, the first hour of this film is stultifyingly boring, and mostly consists of static conversations. Far too much reliance is placed on loud music for effect, and the acting is nothing to write home about. Cruise is fairly wooden and too good looking for the hero, while Thandie Newton starts off well and goes downhill quickly. Dougray Scott makes the best of his bad guy, but can't disguise the ill fortune of his miscasting, while Anthony Hopkins sleepwalks a pointless cameo. Ving Rhames is also wasted, once again, in a supporting role. Why not give this guy a break and cast him as the lead for a change! The clichés come quick and fast in this film, and you'll lose count of the number of times we see characters remove their rubber faces to reveal somebody else hidden underneath. And, while I'm at it, Woo, have you ever heard of subtlety? By the time I saw those bloody doves flying about in slow motion AGAIN I was ready to tear my hair out. No doubt that this film was designed to be shown at the cinema; as it's full of loud action and music, watching it at home on video will surely lose a lot of the effect. Aside from the motorbike chase (which is top notch) this adventure is strictly par for the course."

","Let's assume for a second that this was a parody. I had a few hard laughs watching this. John Woo is a king of parodies. He replaced Zucker brothers on the throne.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it seems that Mission Impossible II is quite a serious sequel to Mission Impossible. And I must call it what it is - John Woo is king of crap.<br/><br/>First, the sequences take forever to execute - the guy is obsessed with slow motion. Then all at once the editing gets epilepsy inducing - way too fast and too disconnected for a viewer to realize what's going on. Too many closeups make you uncertain who is who. I've watched a ""making of"" where Woo's multiple camera setup was praised as ingenious... He shot Tom Cruise jumping onto a bridge on a motorcycle with more than ten cameras running simultaneously. It's not ingenious, it only shows that the guy is clueless about what he wants out of the shot. In that shot it took Cruise's character minutes to cover the jump that in reality takes three seconds. There were slow motions, there were repetitions from another angle and there was me yawning and pondering whether it's time to change the channel. And it goes like this through the entire feature. Be it a car chase or an indoor shootout or a beach hand-to-hand combat, it's always the same. A directing mess where a brilliant child of Hong Kong cinematography follows a simple rule: when you don't know what to put in - put everything in.<br/><br/>Woo also possesses no sense whatsoever when the line is crossed between outrageous and silly. Mission Impossible franchise is certainly not about realism. Alright, but Brian De Palma in first MI and J.J.Abrams in third knew how to handle the sensationalistic nature of the story and action. Woo lacks the sensibility. It must be a cultural thing. Maybe in China they see this as a serious work of art. I'd feel embarrassed just to try to put into words what Woo had the gall to put on screen.<br/><br/>I don't know how or why people take this guy seriously and how he keeps landing jobs in Hollywood. I mean it was obvious from ""Broken Arrow"" that the guy is a charlatan. So keep praising this ""master of disaster"", he's fooling all of you. He doesn't care about his movies. Obviously, because he puts very little thought in them."

","Woo, a highly touted director of action sequences, however his abilities to create an entire film leaves a lot to be desired. In fact the entire movie seems to be more concerned with stunts and fighting as opposed to story telling and interesting characters. Without comparing this film to MI1, MI2 lacks character development, has no tension or suspense, and is a complete bore to watch. I blame most of this on Woo's self indulgent action ""poetry"". Doves flying in the middle of a fight, repeated slow-mo abuse, boring gun battles, the list goes on. Gladly it seems that Woo has slowed down production of his action set pieces referred to as films.

","Mission Impossible II is the sequel to Mission Impossible and stars Tom Cruise reprising his role as Ethan Hunt. In this mission Ethan Hunt has to retrieve a deadly virus before a rouge IMF (Impossible Missions Force) agent sells it to the highest bidder. Before Mission Impossible II, Brian De Palma directed the first one, but then he left and gave the reigns to John Woo, who's best known for directing movies like Face Off or Broken Arrow. Also added to the mix is a soundtrack provided by Limp Bizkit, who provides the theme song to Mission Impossible and Metallica. So having John Woo as the director plus music provided by Limp Bizkit and Metallica, I think its safe to say that this Mission Impossible will have no ties to the show or the first one. And also increase the action and focus little on the spying. And what we have here now is an action packed punk, rock n' roll Mission Impossible that has very little to with spy and more with action. Even though John Woo is the director I cant help but feel that someone else directed the first hour of Mission Impossible II as we have this weird love triangle between Tom Cruise, Thandie Newton, and Dougray Scott. I didn't care one bit for this weird love triangle, I wanted to see action, explosions, and doves, which is what John Woo is known for in most of his movies. Also having Dougray Scott as the villain was miscast as he did not once show any signs of fear, or intimidation, but I found him very annoying and irritating that it was wasted potential. The main problem I have with this is the script as it feels so lazy and rushed that the script writers couldn't be bothered with editing or coming up with crafty dialogue. And it's all over the place, as it gives no explanation how this is connected with this. But thankfully John Woo and composer Hans Zimmer jump in at the last hour and gives us what we came here to really see and give us goose bumps. So in the end, I wouldn't say that this a bad movie, but I would call it a guilty pleasure of the Mission Impossible franchise. But it would've been better if everyone including the studio pitched in and balanced the spy and the action."

","'Mission: Impossible II (2000)' is not so much a different flavour as an entirely different meal, a cheesy Hong-Kong action movie that makes people who thought the first was too action-heavy for the 'Mission: Impossible' franchise (as it then was) seem downright foolish by comparison. It's so overwrought, so melodramatic and so sincerely self-serious that I think it'd be difficult to actually take seriously even if it had been executed successfully. As it is, the bafflingly-styled and incredibly disappointing picture often feels as though it thinks it's gut-wrenching, Shakespearean high-drama when really it's essentially just shlock. However, while it is certainly a bad film, I can't deny that there's some counter-intuitive enjoyment to be had, especially in the no-holds-barred third act. This bizarre entertainment arises because it's all so stupid and that you can laugh at, not with, the piece every few minutes when, invariably, a moment somehow sillier than the last happens. Like they say, a bad movie is better than a totally boring one, though this does unfortunately have its moments of genuine tedium, too. It does have the best uses of the series' signature masks, though. The fact it takes itself so seriously that it can't be 'in on the joke' is perhaps the icing on the cake, as even a hint of a wink would reduce the flick's already limited 'cheesy' enjoyment.

"AnishMisra","6","0","1","21 July 2018"," Mission: Impossible II Review
","Mission: Impossible - 2 is a film directed by John Woo. Many people have cited this to be the worst entry in the M: I series. I can also say the very same thing after I saw it again. <br/><br/>Plot: Ethan and his IMF team have to retrieve a biological weapon called Chimer from rogue IMF agent Sean Ambrose, who intends to make a profit out of it.<br/><br/>Story and direction: After loving the film Face/Off (again by John Woo and by far his best Hollywood attempt) I would say that I had high expectations from this film. First, let us get on with the positives. The set design and scenery of Australia is very beautifully utilized. I feel in love with Australia after watching this film. The cinematography of the film is what enhanced the scenery. Hans Zimmer's score is also awesome. The scenes had an additional layer of tension thanks to the BGM. Most of the action scenes too worked for me. Now, for the negatives of the film. The plot itself is very boring. I was invested in the first 15 minutes or so of the film and towards the end, the film gets interesting. It is the middle half/45 minutes that are so badly written. It is also full of unnecessary drama that the film didn't need. The villain I felt was set up very nicely and provided nice characterization. But he was underplayed as the makers wanted to focus on Nyah and Ethan's romance, which was dull and drab. Even for a moment I wasn't invested in that part of the story. And sometimes, the action scenes did have a lot of slo-mo. I understand that slo-mo is a technique that is used to enhance a particular scene. But in this film, it is used in almost every scene. And that finished its effect that it tried to create and irritated me after some time. 
Performances: Tom Cruise and Ving Rhames were just spot on and gave charismatic performances. Thandie Newton was also good, it is just her character felt unnecessary to the plot. Dougray Scott did give an effective performance but it would have well appreciated if he was given more importance. Richard Roxburgh and Brendan Gleeson did provide good supporting roles. And finally, Anthony Hopkins. Although his role was more of a cameo, it was good to see him. <br/><br/>Favorite Scene: It was where Hunt and his team decide to infiltrate Biocyte and destroy Chimera while Sean and his team decode the steps Ethan will take to destroy the Chimera. This scene for once displayed the capabilities of Sean as a capable villain giving a toigh competition to our hero, Ethan Hunt.<br/><br/>Verdict: The film could have been better if it would have stuck to the tension and thrill that any spy film needs instead of focusing on the romance. It felt like a romantic drama instead of a spy thriller film. This film felt like a detour from the previous instalment. I would say this film as more of a time pass and can be avoided. Only watch it for the stunts and the charismatic Tom Cruise.<br/><br/>I am going with a 6/10."
"williamspencer-29395","2","0","1","22 June 2018"," A strange failure for the series...
","This movie sucks, but it's strange how it fails.<br/><br/>When you get down to the Mission: Impossible series, all of them are almost the exact same story told over and over again. And yet they all work despite the fact that they always have the same beats. Each one involves Ethan Hunt getting disavowed by the IMF and having to work with the barebones essentials without the safety net of the government. He always has to break in to a place before someone else does, usually involving great heights. And the climax is always an insane chase sequence. But, they all work because instead of coming to the movies for the plots, you come to it to see how each director gives his stamp to the same plot.<br/><br/>Except for this one - for the most part. It very much has the same action beats - especially the break-in and the chase scene - but is done in such a bloated, boring, bombastic way that it kind of feels like the cinematic equivalent of television static. They trade the ""we're on our own, guys. We need to find who's framing us,"" storyline for some sort of riff on ""The Spy Who Loved Me,"" and in trying something new, it accidentally fails the worst.<br/><br/>On the series' standards, there's really two big failures: one, Ethan is never disavowed, so the tension of a man left to his guns is non-existent. Two, and the far bigger sin is the fact that there's never really the big Tom Cruise stunt set-piece that we're looking forward to. The closest is the opening credits rock climb sequence, but that's not some big setpiece with stakes -- it's just the character's intro. He doesn't really have anything for the story to move forward, and in context, it's just Ethan Hunt on vacation. He does this for fun, so we're not in suspense at anything he's doing. So, if anything, this sequence actually damns the rest of the movie because there's no big stunt for him to top maybe outside of the chase at the end.<br/><br/>Thandie Newton really is the MacGuffin, and I don't really want to put most of the blame on her, but too much of it is her fault. She's more annoying and smug that charming, and so we don't really care about this whole ""Spy Who Loved Me"" thing her and Ethan are going through.<br/><br/>Dougary Scott as the villain... I actually don't remember anything about him other than how he acts when he's first introduced, and he's one of those bad guys who's more just smug and evil for the sake of being evil. He actually reminds me a lot of how horribly Rupert Everett played Doctor Claw in the ""Inspector Gadget"" movie. He's not as bad, but he definitely belongs in the same vein.<br/><br/>The Mission: Impossible series actually creates an interesting timeline of blockbuster action movies at the time each was made, and this one really may just be a victim of timing. John Woo was no longer this beloved Hong Kong-action maestro; he was more of a poor man's Michael Bay who's style was really getting stale at that point. It also represents the era where script doctors were over-used. It's not like they haven't been rampant for the last 25+ years, but this era especially had this problem where it felt like every single page of the script was written by a different writer.<br/><br/>The saddest, though, must be Hans Zimmer... my God, HOW could he make a score this boring? He decided to base it heavily in guitars, mainly electric and Spanish acoustic. The electric makes it feel like a try-hard college freshman frat-bro, the kind that blasts the loudest metal he can out of his stereo. It's the lamest, it's like Nirvana trying to be Limp Bizkit. I think he was trying to off-set the ""loud, energetic, bombastic"" electric with the ""cool, serene, laid-back"" Spanish acoustic, but it is just so boring and pretentious. It's not calming us down, it's lulling us to sleep. It might just be my musical tastes repelling that really acoustic sound - I hate it, it just sounds like a guitar being tuned - but at the same time, I should not be thinking that something by the guy who did the music to ""The Lion King"" is not done as well as it was in ""Spy Kids."" Yes. ""Spy Kids,"" and I think that's because Robert Rodriguez is actually Mexican, and was using the guitar to compose, not as an esthetic. <br/><br/>I always thought that maybe this series needs to stick to the same story line to keep interesting, just having the director spice it up, and for the most part that has been the case. However, Rogue Nation is basically what this movie was trying to be without abandoning the staples of the franchise and coming out at a time when not all action movies sucked. So, not only does it make this a failed experiment, but the fact that that movie exists, and succeeds, makes this movie entirely pointless, not even for curiosity's sake. I have the blu-rays of the series, but to be completely honest, I haven't used this one for anything other than a coaster."

However, for the second half of the movie it really degrades into a classical John Woo, over the top, action feast with all pretense of intelligence and any true Mission Impossible feel gone. John Woo is not the right person to make a Mission Impossible movie.<br/><br/>As with the first movie if it would not have been labeled Mission Impossible I would probably have given it a higher rating since it is a decent enough, mostly brain dead though, Hollywood action movie. However, I have higher expectations from a movie labeled Mission Impossible.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is quite okay as Ethan Hunt. Dougray Scott is okayish as the bad guy. Sometimes he projects the right big bad and mad bad-guy attitude but sometimes he is just silly and just as over the top as the action scenes. He is supposed to be a mastermind but he comes out as a thug a' la a not so intelligent drug baron in many scenes.<br/><br/>The action scenes? Well, they are classical John Woo material. Fast paced with a lot of stunts and things that go boom. They are also, as expected, hugely over the top and unbelievable. They provide a enjoyable visual experience but, as I wrote above, they are not really what I would expect from a Mission Impossible movie.<br/><br/>The romance between Hunt and Nyah is the typical Hollywood, let's throw in a sexy girl and some superficial attraction, which develops from get lost to I love you in the matter of a few hours of contact, between the lead character and the girl.

Hopkins in particular, actually, seems to be hamming his way through a local business commercial. <br/><br/>At one point it did have me, and I could excuse the Joel Schumacher style antics (I""m quite surprised he didn't direct MI:II). The female lead is convincing enough at first, and Ethan Hunt's method of recruiting her draws the viewer in. But then we go on to realise even she has no personality, just the old 'I'm a female thief' motif. This movie actually expects us to identify the characters with tropes and just let it go.<br/><br/>Where it really lost me was the ever increasingly outrageous fight scenes. At one point, the movie goes into literally a 26 minute chase scene followed by a 6 minute hand-to-hand combat scene. I'm guessing they had about 30 million dollars left in the budget and decided to spend it all on an extra 30+ minutes of stunt doubles flipping about and bikes doing wheelies. Serious, for that entire length of time there's 2 lines of dialogue between the ughs, bangs, and booms.<br/><br/>It keeps no consistency. One minute we're joking in the middle of a fight, the next Hunt is almost gruesomely decapitated by ...a rusty car bonnet... and the next the merciful good guys are laughing at a car full of enemies blown to pieces and sinking into the sea. MI:II is not trying to communicate anything in tone. That's mainly because many scenes are straight takes or homages to other movies and do not mold well with MI:II's campy blockbuster vibe.<br/><br/>On the upside, though, it has good cinematography when its not idiotically zooming in objects and faces, showing flashbacks of events that happened 5 minutes ago, and cutting away from action to save from paying for an actual effects/stunt department (instead of the film school students they seem to have hired to pump out this trite). Let's call this one an excuse to watch a 26 year old Thandie Newton make faces at the camera for 2 hours."
"rcolgan","6","0","1","21 August 2015"," Bad Plot, But Some Great Action
","Just like the first ""Mission: Impossible"" film was entirely different to the TV show it was based on, ""Mission: Impossible II"" is nothing like it's 1996 predecessor. The slow, tension building pace Palma used in the first film, has been replaced by John Woo's love of fast paced action and insane shootouts. Woo draws from the auteurist action movies he made in the east like ""The Killer"" in order to bring his own brand of high octane action to western filmmaking. <br/><br/>If anyone doubted how different Woo's style would be, he immediately distances his style from the first film in the first 5 minutes. Whilst ""Mission: Impossible"" had its agents receive missions in stylish way that resembled a Bond movie, with a cassette tape being delivered on a plane before detonating in a puff of smoke, that approach was apparently not extreme enough for the generation that made films like ""Bad Boys"" a hit. So instead the mission is delivered to Hunt as he climbs a cliff, with a helicopter firing down the assignment in a missile containing a pair of sunglasses, which he listens to before they explode in a ball of flame. It's completely pointless and serves no purpose to the plot. But it's still an awesome introduction to the film, and sets the tone for the ludicrous and enjoyable action to come. <br/><br/>To match ridiculous action sequences like this, the plot is similarly as ridiculous and over the top. This time Ethan's mission is to retrieve and destroy a genetically engineered disease called 'Chimera', before a group of terrorists led by formal IMF agent Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) get a hold of it and release it to the public. To get close to him Ethan is told to recruit Sean's ex- girlfriend Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton) so she can seduce him. But of course as the typical American action hero, Hunt falls in love with her and thus must both stop the terrorists and save the girl.<br/><br/>Coincidentally, just like the first film had a heavy Hitchcock influence through its visual style and slow pacing, this film has a plot that is heavily inspired by Hitchcock's ""Notorious"". However unlike Notorious where there was a genuine connection between the two leads, here Cruise and Newton share no such chemistry. They hardly even spend any time together, having only a short amount of screen time with a little flirting, a short car race, and a single night of passion. But for the action movie formula, this is apparently enough to justify them being madly in love.<br/><br/>This wouldn't be a problem if this film did the same as the first ""Mission: Impossible"" and spent minimal time on character and story. But here a great portion of the film hinges on Cruise worrying for her and it doesn't work since no real connection is established between the pair. There's also several plot holes and continuity errors, with characters just showing up in random places with no explanation whatsoever. Although in the films defence, supposedly the original cut was intended to be over 3 hours long, but had to be cut down for a cinematic release which would explain most of these problems. <br/><br/>Regardless, it's easy to look past this weak plotting, because as always Woo's real strength relies on his action sequences. And as usual he's on top form. He transforms Cruise from the stealthy espionage spy he played in the first film, into an all American action hero similar to the likes of John Rambo. <br/><br/>Hunt fights through seemingly unbeatable odds, gunning down terrorists and blowing up cars, all whilst hardly gaining a single scratch because he's just that deadly. And of course Woo throws all his usual trademarks into the mix, like Cruise constantly dual wielding pistols, the gratuitous but cool slow motion and of course random doves being thrown into the climax. <br/><br/>But even for a director like Woo who made his name through over the top sequences like the one take hallway sequence in ""Hard Boiled"", this still feels a little overdone. For example, at one point in the film when Cruise is breaking into a terrorist hideout, a door blows up and a dove literally flies through the flames. Moments like this are so ridiculous that they end up feeling less like a genuine action movie and more like a flat out parody. <br/><br/>Even with these moments that go a little too far, it can't be denied that nobody does action quite the same as Woo does it. If his brand of insane violence didn't appeal in his previous work like ""Face Off"" or ""A Better Tomorrow"", it won't appeal here. But if you do enjoy his adrenaline fuelled style, then you'll likely enjoy it here. And whilst it may not be the strongest of the series, it's nonetheless another fun outing for the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise."
"luke-a-mcgowan","5","0","1","14 August 2015"," More of a soap opera than a fun film, Woo's overly sexualised Mission Impossible fun is lacking in thrills and tension
","I've never ever seen a director so bad at directing an actress as John Woo was at directing Thandie Newton. I am without words for how badly he handles who I consider one of the most underrated actresses of her generation. The only person who is more blatant at this was Michael Bay directing Transformers, when he had Megan Fox posing on the motorbike. I'll come right back to this. <br/><br/>Mission Impossible 2 opens with some guy doing some darn impressive climbing scenes in the mountains. I say some guy because whilst he looks like Ethan Hunt and sounds like Ethan Hunt - this guy is most certainly not Ethan Hunt. John Woo takes the frenetic, high-octane guy that we've seen in every other film and ramps the charisma up to 11 and turns down everything else. They could've taken Tom Cruise out and replaced him with Pierce Brosnan and honestly it would've felt more right. Hunt is too flirty and suave in this film - Cruise is at his best when his back is against the wall (as in the other four Mission Impossibles, where he has been a rogue agent), so to have him carrying out a fairly basic IMF mission means that the tension is gone from him. This is just another mission to him, and it shows in his lack of energy at times.<br/><br/>To pair with Cruise is Newton, who I really enjoyed watching. She's gorgeous, dignified and even a bit catlike in her thieving scenes (if only there was more than one in the entire film). However, after Hunt recruits Hall (and bangs her for fun), he is told by his boss that Newton's role is just to pretend to be the villain's girlfriend. Hunt's reaction to this news is about what I imagine Newton's was. ""I thought we were recruiting her for her talent"" he snarls, barely able to conceal his contempt. Again, this is pretty much how I felt whenever I watched awful, sexualised scenes of Newton - whether its unnecessary cleavage camera work, or her asking Hunt ""what are you going to do, spank me?"" in the middle of a tense confrontation. Splice in the porn-quality score and suggestive camera work, and Mission Impossible suddenly changes genres.<br/><br/>Hunt's mission is to have Hall infiltrate Sean Ambrose's confidences. Of course, many are suspicious of this, including Ambrose's loyal henchman Stamp (Richard Roxburgh, who can't seem to decide on an accent). Ambrose himself is aware that Hall is probably a mole, but he goes along with it because he's a sex-crazed psychopath (quote, ""I am gagging for it""), and when Stamp dares to ask if he's sure, Ambrose politely agrees and cuts off Stamp's finger for some reason. <br/><br/>While Hall infiltrates Ambrose in Sydney (oh, this movie takes place in Australia for some reason), Hunt and his team (an excellent Ving Rhames and an unbearable John Polson, who in three seconds creates the most excruciating Australian stereotype ever put to film) set up in the outback. WHY ON EARTH ARE THEY IN THE OUTBACK? There's nowhere in ALL OF SYDNEY that they can set up? The Australian slang is excruciatingly manufactured coming from the actors, even from native Australian Polson.<br/><br/>Its cut together with typical John Woo action - two guns, flying pigeons, endless slow-mo sequences, and an explosion is always warranted. Seriously, there are points where explosions and slow-mo is incorporated where I think ""why are you doing this, Woo, why?"" Two motorbikes collide in midair and explode for some reason, instead of just scuffing each other and falling heavily to the ground. Meanwhile, Hunt (who misses a big ""impossible mission"" sequence in this movie) has one scene where he must destroy the Chimera virus, and despite Rhames shouting helplessly that he must hurry, Woo decided to shoot Cruise in slow-motion. Its excruciating to watch.<br/><br/>Mission Impossible 2 is an action soap opera. The music, overacting, and even the way people move around the room and discuss betrayals. Its fun and harmless if you turn your brain off, but focusing you will see its a giant blob of stuff that Woo should never have been allowed to make under the Mission Impossible banner. He should never be allowed to work with Thandie Newton again, that's for sure."
"lpquig","5","0","1","12 August 2015"," Completely throws the first film out of the window
","I really wanted to love this film. The original Mission: Impossible was a great action flick that actually made me think. This movie unfortunately took everything I loved about the first one and tossed it out the window. Gone is the semi-cohesive plot that gets your brain working. It's replaced with one of the most by the numbers, boring, script I've ever seen put to the screen. Woo's direction is typical of him, with a lot of slo-mo shots and ridiculous shootouts. There are some decent looking action scenes, including a well done motorcycle chase scene, although it is completely ruined by the scenes end. My biggest problem with this film is the complete shift in tone. Ethan Hunt is made to look more like a James Bond character and less like himself. It is very clear that this film was the only one that was this way because by the time Abrams took over for M:I3, we were back to the same old Ethan. All in all, this film is a failed attempt to make the Mission: Impossible series ""cool"", when in fact, it was ""cool"" all along."
"caseynicholson","4","0","1","4 August 2015"," Far From a Great Movie--But Not Bad if You're Expecting The Worst
","Expectations are everything when it comes to watching a movie. The last time I watched this film, I was watching it in preparation for the latest MI movie, and seeing it for the first time since 2000 just made me sick to my stomach. It is a far cry from the original in the franchise, and there are a multitude of scenes that just make it a silly movie that is overdone with action and goofy camera work. At the time I gave the film 1/10 stars. I was just terribly disappointed in it, compared to the other Tom Cruise MI films.<br/><br/>That said, I recently gave it another try and went into things expecting an absolutely atrocious film. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that it was a fair bit more stomachable when I went into it expecting the worst. The film is directed by John Woo, who is a famous director in Asia, and as such it emulates ninja movies and the like. There are plenty of martial arts scenes, along with gratuitous scenes of explosions and silly slow motion effects.<br/><br/>Still, if you can get past the cinematography, this isn't that bad of a film. There are certainly worse movies out there. Well, OK. It's still a bad movie. But not crazy bad. Just bad. A long story short the script isn't horrible, it's just the style of the film that makes it hard to watch. And the final fight scene is just ridiculous. I'm giving it 4/10 stars, with thoughts of a 5. It's close to mediocre, but still bad overall."
"Geeky Randy","2","0","1","4 August 2015"," Geeky Randy's summary
","John Woo dumbs down this sequel to the 1996 action-spy blockbuster so much that it's almost unwatchable. What was cool back in spring 2000 and became out of style by autumn 2000 is all here: Limp Bizkit's rendition of Lalo Schifrin's theme, Tom Cruise's bad haircut, Thandie Newton as the leading lady, Anthony Hopkins hanging out in Spain, Rade erbedija and his mustache, etc. Yes, this film's predecessor is a bit more complicated than what it needed to be, but it didn't need to be given a lobotomy. Even Ving Rhames' reprisal and the Australian setting can't save this hopeless, dull waste of two hours. The 1960's show's cast responded negatively to the first film, it'd be interesting to hear what they have to say about this one.<br/><br/>★½ (out of four)"
"Al_The_Strange","6","0","1","2 August 2015"," ""We just rolled up a snowball and tossed it into hell.""
","Ethan Hunt returns for another mission. This time it's far more extreme and far more impossible. Riding the wave of insane action movies of the 2000s - utterly ridiculous films like Charlie's Angels, Die Another Day, xXx, and more - MI:2 is an adrenaline shot full of flash and style.<br/><br/>Unlike the first film, which was more interested in being a spy thriller, MI:2 comes off as a pretty silly and trashy action flick. Much of the story revolves around a biochemical weapon, so the film takes some time to set up the characters with some deception and counter-deception games. When the last hour hits, it becomes an all-out bombardment of over-the-top setpieces, featuring lots of explosive gunplay, dramatic fistfights, and vehicular carnage. There are some bizarre motorcycle stunts, including a scene where Ethan pops a wheelie on the front tire; I'm pretty sure a lot of this defies the laws of physics. A lot of these scenes are ordained with dramatic slow-motion flames...and doves! Lots of freaking doves everywhere for no apparent reason! What do they mean?! The experience of this film is a weird one; the action can be pretty enthralling in its own right, but the build-up to it drags at times, and then when it all goes into overdrive, it's almost overbearing. A lot of scenes require a huge suspension of disbelief. Above all though, the film feels like it follows in the footsteps of so many other action films before it, such as The Rock, GoldenEye, and John Woo's own films like Hard Boiled and Broken Arrow. In the end, it feels like a tiresome ""all style no substance"" show.<br/><br/>A lot of this is because the whole plot around the Chimera virus doesn't really break new ground, and combined with the ridiculous action and style, the film feels shallow and senseless. There are a few redeeming qualities, however. Inspired by Hitchcock's Notorious, MI:2 does handle its characters well enough; the romance between Ethan and Nyah is pretty nice, the villain is a good bad guy we can love to hate, and their interactions overall gives the plot enough weight to make it work.<br/><br/>This film is made with some very flashy photography and editing; there are a few transitions I find gaudy, but most of the film is pretty stylish and good-looking. Tom Cruise still does his usual schtick, but it is pretty fun to watch Thandie Newton, Ving Rhames, and Dougray Scott in their roles. Brendan Gleeson and Anthony Hopkins are respectable in their small roles. Didn't care much for John Polson. Writing is not particularly great, but some of the lines are pretty amusing. This production uses some very exotic locales, sets, props, costumes, and special effects. I love Hans Zimmer's music score for this - a pretty wild blend of operatic and metal cues - and the film does use a few excellent heavy metal songs (for better or for worse).<br/><br/>This is a pretty odd film for the series; it's not much of a Mission: Impossible film, but it is pretty entertaining as a mindless action flick, and it does represent the height of John Woo's stylistic excesses. Genre and franchise fans should give it a try once.<br/><br/>3/5 (Experience: Mixed | Story: Okay | Film: Pretty Good)"

","(Review in preparation for Rogue Nation) It is a few years after the events of the first film and while Ethan Hunt is on holiday, he receives an assignment to recover a stolen virus called Chimera and recruit a third team member who had a prior relationship with the man who stole the virus; a rogue IMF agent Sean Ambrose.<br/><br/>Out of all of the ""M:I"" films, this one is probably the most divisive and my least favorite of the series. I used to like this when I was younger and I don't think its one of the worst movies ever made but having grown up watching the original ""M:I"" TV series and other films after this one it feels weaker and it strays too far from what ""Mission: Impossible"" is supposed to be.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise reprises his role as Ethan Hunt and in this one he sports a longer haircut and wears dark sunglasses during the action sequences. His performance comes across more like a James Bond type of character than the one from the previous film. Ving Rhames is back from the previous film but isn't given much to do. New cast is Thandie Newton, Dougray Scott, John Polson and Brendan Gleeson who all give good performances but Dougray Scott gets my pick as one of the weaker villains of the series since his character is just a rehash of the one from the previous film, just more younger and sadistic.<br/><br/>In the directors chair this time is Hong Kong action director John Woo who's highly stylized and hip take makes ""M:I 2"" feel more like a generic action film than ""M:I"".

"kennethcarino","6","0","1","16 July 2015"," Diagnosis: This needs an antidote for clichés and plot holes stat!
","Mission Impossible 2 is a bang on movie. Judging from the rating and reviews, the sequel to the first classic Mission Impossible film is not well received but who cares when you really have nothing to do just to pass time and it's not a bad thing in itself; movies are essentially to entertain us. Mission Impossible 2 is just that, a good fun action movie that is entertaining and catered to mass audience who may essentially want action on its own with less talky and less smart narrative.<br/><br/>The movie is directed by John Woo and it opens up with a scientist narrating the myth of Bellerophon and the Chimera from the Greek myth. In this case, chimera is referred to as the virus while Bellerophon is obviously the cure. As with many spy and action movies terrorists are trying to acquire the virus and the cure and as always it is up to Ethan Hunt (played by Tom Cruise) to stop them. Without spoiling much of the story (though it is obvious), the plot and twists were actually less than what it seems and as such it is what kept the audience interested long enough though it fell short. The first half has been interesting and tense enough but nothing compared to the first Mission Impossible movie. There are wires, jumping and split second hazards as the first movie but were not expanded and fell short. After the second half of the film it became rather tedious and too predictable action with no depth. The cinematography was for me is less than average. There were too many annoying and unnecessary slow motion action scenes like Ethan Hunt turning around to shoot a guy after barely escaping from a bunker facility. There were also some plot holes by which, if had been patched, the everything would have been solved already. In that sense, it is probably intentional just for the sake of action but if you see the plot holes, as an audience it will kind of ruin your viewing experience of the film. Of course, the movie does not want you to think but just watch passively and enjoy the killing and shooting and all the silly actions that John Woo presented. I did enjoy them enough but I cannot unthink what I saw!<br/><br/>In terms of acting I thought the casts were good and Thandie Newton and Tom Cruise were good together but their relationship together was not developed well enough and was forced in an instant. They did not have a strong chemistry which I felt was for the sole purpose of having an obligatory love interest. I would think that it was probably so that the movie could focus more on traditional action. One major criticism I have on one of the actor was of Dougray Scott who plays as the villain Sean Ambrose. His character was very one dimensional and unconvincing, a very typical action movie villain. There were was a brief scene where he was shown to have a rather more humane and sensitive side but that fell short too similar to the plot. Now having said this, I cannot say if Dougray Scott could be blamed or the script. More than likely it was the script's fault because watching the final product it appears to be the case. Similarly, near the end, the character of Ethan Hunt slightly suffers from one dimensional action hero where he finally unleashed the action hero archetype: unkillable and still active despite countless body traumas he has suffered and no bruises too.<br/><br/>Mission Impossible 2 is a good average action film and so if you have not seen the movie don't expect too much and don't think about it too much. Just try to enjoy the movie as it is and it is not as bad as many people claim it to be. The plot and narrative do suffer from the classic action film virus: predictable and silly action, one dimensional villain, death defying superhuman protagonist, obligatory chase scenes and love interest. Indeed, MI2 is afflicted with action movie cliché flu and it needs its own Bellerophon: a huge dose of better writing. Though the diagnosis is too late because many people have caught the flu and they either did not survive watching the movie and hated it, or they survived and liked it. Well I fall in the survivor's group and liked it. But let me be clear: this does not mean however that I would watch the film the second time to catch another flu. The next sequel Mission Impossible 3 clearly cured the story and treated all the symptoms."

","*WARNING MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* The first Mission Impossible movie took an unexpected twist on the regular spy formula, and went in for investigation and suspense instead of action. This movie works more as a generic James Bond movie, think along the lines of Die Another Day. Tom Cruise goes from being the guy who is not skilled what-so-ever in hand-to-hand combat, to being... this. John Woo, the director, abuses slo-mo in this movie as well, making all of the fights... pretty boring actually. It's just watching slo-mo flips and kicks for the last half hour of this movie. If you look at the opening credits, the movie will make a lot more sense, because there you will see: produced by Tom Cruise. Okay, enough formless hating, let's sift through all the insanity, and talk about what does and does not work in this movie. Let's start with what does, because that's a much shorter list. Now, adding some action in was not a bad idea, maybe they might have handled it poorly, but we'll get to that in a minute. Adding in a villain was also a good idea, and making him an evil counterpart to Ethan Hunt was also a good idea, but once again, the execution was handled pretty poorly. I even think the idea of a genetic virus called Chimera could've been a good plot point, but... well, it wasn't. Now, I'd like to talk about what I always thought was the most glaring problem here, the complete change in styles. As I said, MI 1 was an intelligent investigation movie, and this is a rip off of James Bond movies. The two don't go together at all. And, yes I understand with the MI setup of different directors, you're going to have differences, but this movie isn't just directed differently, it's also directed badly. Also, let's be honest, this movie is little more than a Tom Cruise ego trip disguised as a real movie. And since Tom Cruise seems to think he has to just be some perfect agent or whatever, it's hard to connect to his character, especially when he's paired up with Thandie Newton, because the two have like the worst on screen chemistry. Dougry Scott, who plays the villain, does not give a good performance either, despite the fact that his character could've been a good villain. An evil Ethan Hunt? C'mon, how can you go so wrong with that idea? The plot, if you can call it that, seems like just a bunch of random events thrown together, and it is very confusing at times, but at the same time incredibly stupid, if that makes any sense. See, the first one was confusing, but this one just doesn't make any sense because it's so ridiculous. On one final point, I know that the first movie was very cheesy, and was just supposed to be entertaining, but this one doesn't have the lack of self-seriousness, it's like two hours of Tom Cruise going, ""Oh yeah, I'm awesome!"" Because, it's like they take all these ludicrous stunts seriously, so it's hard to have fun with the movie, aside from laughing at how bad it is. In conclusion, Mission: Impossible II is a bad movie, with a weak and under utilized cast, bad directing, a wasted story, and some very bad action scenes."

Stripped of it's unconventional anecdotes, John Woo's M:I-2 is just another generic action movie. Cruise's greatest feat is performed before the opening credits feature and the only aspect of an impossible mission comes from Hunt's love interest Nyah (Thandie Newton), who goes undercover to find out the whereabouts of a disease called Chimera from 'crime-lord' Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott in fine villainous form). For a good chunk of the film's second act, Ethan has little to do. Newton's work overstays its welcome. When the twists and turns eventually arrive it's too little, too late. At least Cruise, with his silky mane, looks like he's having a blast, it's just a pity it can't be said for the rest of us. Even the life-like face masks are missing.

","I must admit that I did like the first mission impossible film quite a bit but this film is just poor in anybody's book. This film sees the return of Ethan hunt as he looks to stop an old ally from releasing a deadly virus on the world. Now I really did like tom cruise's performance in the first film but something just seems a bit off with him in this film. I mean he still does a decent job but he just seemed lethargic and not really interested. The side characters are a mixed bag with both the villain and his main henchman being more like cartoons then realistic representations of what villains should be in a film like this. But I thought Ethan's New love interest nya did a good job and she has pretty good chemistry with cruise even tough the story does make it hard to believe. Also another thing I liked is that they gave ving rhames's character luthor a bigger role in this and I believe he does a really good job easily being my favourite character in the film. In the first film one thing I really liked was the story and the twists and turns they took but in this film there is no such luck. The story is unnecessarily complicated and none of the reasoning for actions are ever really explained at all. The script is okay with hunt and nya having some good dialogue between them but also none of the villains had any good lines and a lot of the dialogue did feel forced. But easily the biggest complaint I have with this film is its style of the film. There was so much slow motion it became insulting and it really took me out of the film. This film is a massive let down and makes me look less forward to the 3rd film."

","There was a brief period of time when John Woo was considered the most exciting action director in cinema. His over the top style frequently includes balletic gunfights, slow motion and martial arts which are easy on the eye. It can prove quite distracting if you're not prepared for it, but for those willing to go with it, there is a lot of fun to be had.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, in Mission Impossible 2, Woo has seemed to have forgotten that stylistic action is his strongest asset, with a lot of the movie feeling overly long and dragged out. It doesn't help that the plot is a simple case of stopping a virus from destroying the world; not terrible by any stretch, but you would expect more from the guy who brought us Face/Off.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise puts in a decent performance, convincingly pulling off the action hero look, but the same cannot be said for those around him. Dougray Scott, despite his best efforts, is a bland, 2 dimensional villain who really wants to be more diabolical than he is, Ving Rhames doesn't really do anything and Thandie Newton is embarrassingly bad as the love interest. In fact, the entire love story proves to be rather cringe worthy throughout, with a number of corny scenes and absolutely zero chemistry between Cruise and Newton contributing to a sub-plot which doesn't need to be there in the first place.<br/><br/>Thankfully, when the action lands it is every bit as enjoyable as you would hope, with a number of breathtaking stunts on show; the most impressive of which sees Cruise hanging from a cliff face with nothing but his hands preventing a grisly death, and a fantastic motorcycle chase towards the end which showcases Woo at his best before an overly long fist fight dulls the experience again. There is a frustrating tendency to overuse his trademark slow motion, and a few 'twists' stretch the limits of plausibility but if you can overlook these flaws, you will find a fun, but forgettable, action flick.<br/><br/>An enjoyable action romp which tries hard to be much better than it is."

On the other hand, I knew that this was 'Mission: Impossible' and judging by the first movie, I had a feeling that the plot might be a bit convoluted. I was right the first time.<br/><br/>MI:2 is a mindless action movie in the truest sense of the word. The plot involving Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) trying to retrieve a stolen killer virus simply a hook to hang a lot of action scenes on. But being that Woo knows how to create great visuals and tries new things with is style, you know that the action won't be boring.<br/><br/>The positive this time is the addition of Thandie Newton (one of my favorite actresses) of 'Flirting' and 'Beloved', a beautiful actress with smoldering eyes, she brings life to scenes that otherwise would have been a big yawn. I should also mention the addition of Anthony Hopkins. He is always exciting to watch.<br/><br/>The downside is that the movie seems to be 'dumming it down' in favor of a bigger, louder action movie.

Not so much a movie as a stylism or 3-D postcard of Australia, with Cruise as the uber-sharp agent impervious to everything, and Dougray Scott as his Scottish nemesis. Cruise is assigned to convince Thandie Newton to embed herself (literally) with former lover Scott to determine how an eminent professor died en route to a safe haven after discovering a mutant, deadly virus.<br/><br/>Gleeson plays a greedy pharmaceutical magnate who wants to purchase both the virus and the antidote to control supply and demand; Hopkins is wasted in a minor role at the bookends giving Cruise his fantastic orders. The villains are suitably swarthy but clichéd, Roxburgh's Afrikaaner accent not sufficient to convey as intimidating, a point driven home when he squeals like a débutante after having his pinky 'tipped'. Ving Rhames is also on-side, sharply dressed with a joke or two to match, but no substance or bearing on the outcome.<br/><br/>Stunts are the main game, and they're so over the top as to be utterly laughable, so too is the misplaced Woo signature of the white doves. I accept that Woo conveys a unique style, and indulges in an artistic approach, unfortunately someone seems to have tampered with his canvass and paints on this occasion. Let's be clear, this isn't James Bond, it's just poor imitation and perhaps a pointer to why the next instalment was six years away - though still not long enough to forget this debacle."

I really enjoyed the first mission impossible and this film, with it's awesome sound track, (limp bizkit being one of my favourite bands AND doing the theme song.) and all the promotions for it seemed like it was going to kick ass. Also I'm a fan of John Woo's American movies such as Face/Off, Replacement Killers and Broken Arrow (Haven't seen his Hong Kong flicks) all signs pointed to this movie being non-stop action with some good humour thrown in the mix.<br/><br/>What I got was a very long, dragged out, dry, humourless, predictable movie with literally zero action until the end of the film. Not to mention, Limp Bizkit's theme wasn't even used for more than 12 seconds! John Woo is famous for using slow motion, it's one of his trademarks. Which is fine for action sequences and so on. But Woo uses slow-motion in practically every scene. So this two hour movie is really only about an hour and a half, but dragged out because so much was done in slow motion. There was a scene where Thandie Newton's character approaches Dougray Scott's character. I swear to god the scene is 5 minutes long simply slow motion of them staring at each other. Also, the dialogue is so lacking that there's virtually no character development on anyone. <br/><br/>All around a disappointment.

","The first movie I gotta admit you can sort of just go with it. But the mission was impossible and not because of the difficulty of the mission. But because of how the implausible a lot of stuff that happens in it, including the plot holes. But it was overall a solid spy thriller for the most part. This movie tries to add spy elements into the movie but the mission this time isn't very cleverly crafted. And comes off as a kung-fu shoot em up movie with bunch of stylish gunplay thrown in. The movie just comes off as some dude with long hair and sunglasses doing crazy gun stunts while wearing a leather jacket and driving a motorcycle. Some Asians deem this as cool, but it's just a bit too overused. Even the character Ethan Hunt isn't as likable as he was in the first movie and seemed to be trying a bit too hard to seem like a super cool spy while taking out the realism behind his character. I am not one of those reviewers that bash on a movie for how unrealistic a movie is, but the premise and direction of this movie makes it a movie that should have tried a bit more to be believable. Also despite few of the characters that was in the first movie, this one seems really unrelated to the previous movie. It just seemed gimmicky and lame, especially near the end. This mostly goes in a direction where you hardly have to use your brain and think things through and just comes off as a pretty narrow story. I will admit though some of the stylish action sequences was pretty cool but that is basically the only good think I can say about this movie. The face mask disguise also played a crucial role in the previous movie without it being gimmicky or cheap with it's uses. But that isn't the same for this flick. Sometimes the exaggerated and even ridiculous gunplay works in certain movies but that just isn't the case for this sequel. Yeah, I can constantly just bash this sequel, but since it does have it's moments although very few. I will give this movie a 5.8/10. Some reviewers claim the first hour of this movie was good but loses it's edge afterwards, but I am going to have to disagree. The redeeming thing about this movie is the action near the end. Although it's ridiculous when it comes to the action and doesn't really fit quite well with the tone of the first half of this movie. The action sequences near the end is pretty cool on couple of parts but mostly gimmicky. So yeah a lot of the action doesn't work as a whole for the movie but if you separate the two it becomes sort of tolerable.

SeriouslyI've seen this several times and never really followed why they needed to create a virus in order for them to have a need for a cure.<br/><br/>Yeah, money, duh.

Granted it has been since 2000 since I saw the movie, but even if you asked me about it a month after I saw it I would still have trouble recollecting it. In fact, I may have liked it less possibly? Not really, I liked it a tad more only because it had more action in it, but that is really all that it has in it. A much more shallow film that one has to wonder is it even an actual sequel to the original film. Sure Cruise is back as Ethan Hunt and Ving Rhames is back too, but it just seems to be happening totally independent of the first film. The first film may as well not exist as you certainly do not have to see the first film to understand or enjoy what is happening in this one. Or the third film for that matter. The only thing in common these films share other than the name and Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt is that they all are kind of forgettable movies. This one being the most so, basically a summer popcorn flick one quickly forgets upon leaving the theater back in the day. This one has Hunt going after some sort of guy making some deadly virus I think. Do not quote me on that though, the only things I remember clearly about this one is the cool fight at the end between Cruise and the guy that came close to being Wolverine in the X-man movies, but instead chose to do this film and the scenes with the very attractive gal and Hunt trying to recruit her. Oh yes, also the strange and pointless addition of Anthony Hopkins and the rock climbing scene too. Cruise is just an enigma though, he seems like he could star in really good films and I am sure there are a couple of really good ones that I have yet to see, but he ends up playing in mostly forgettable fare. I think the highest score for a film that he has been in that I have seen is an 8 for part three. I only gave it that high mainly because of the addition of a memorable bad guy. Nice one of these mindless Mission films had something that was actually memorable in it. I can not believe they are actually making a fourth."

","It's hard to know which pejorative to open with to summarise this movie. Suffice to say that during the moments we were supposed to take seriously or be stunned by the choreographed action the people left and right of me were giggling, shaking their heads, or shielding their eyes with their hands. Sometimes all three things at once. And it's hard not to feel sorry for them: it's so embarrassing to have sit there and watch actors make fools of themselves. This movie is an excellent example of how it all goes wrong when you hire a director who doesn't premise his action scenes on real life, but on real life as portrayed in action movies. You basically get a double-dose of sickening unreality. Top five objectionable points: 1. During a hand-to-hand combat sequence, it apparently helps to leap into the air and rotate your body several times before planting a boot on your opponent's jaw. Ten times out of ten your opponent will not have ducked out of the way and despite having spun around several times for no reason, you will be able to land a perfectly accurate kick. Punching him may be quicker, but then the polaroids wouldn't look as exciting. 2. It's lazy. The movie makers have suited themselves at every turn and tossed any sense of reality out the window. Action movies were never meant to be true to life, but they knew where to stop before alienating their audience. This movie has no respect for its audience. 3. The film oozes the arrogant attitude of: 'Who cares about character development? The terrific action scenes will keep them happy'. Ahem. It's impossible to give a fig about the hero getting killed if you don't give a fig about the hero. So all suspense sequences instantly fail. 4. Leading on from that, the action sequences were *not* terrific. They were bombastic, self-satisfied and self-impressed. They looked ridiculous. You can tell the pivotal moment - you always see it replayed three times from different angles in slow motion. 5. The lovey-dovey scenes had about as much chemistry as an Arts exam. Thandie Newton has an annoying 'bloody' English accent and tries to look like one of the Corrs. Tom Cruise's slo-mo action moments could have been for a shampoo advert. Plus a plot that makes no sense, a villain who could equally have played a tax inspector, and not one - imagine - not one attempt at a one-liner. Take it from me: any movie that makes me want to get this off my chest to the tune of seven paragrpahs is not worth checking out."

Overall, this movie shows a profound ignorance of the culture, language and geography of the country it was set in.<br/><br/>Australians DON'T say ""mate"" every 5 seconds, nor do we have such a ridiculous accent. John Polson, as an Australian you should be ashamed of yourself, showcasing Australian English in such an idiotic and exaggerated way, quite different from how you speak in more respectable films, such as ""The Boys"" (great film).<br/><br/>Note: ""Downtown Sydney"" is NOT in the middle of the bush.<br/><br/>Let me say it again, ""Downtown Sydney"" is NOT in the middle of the bush.<br/><br/>At the time this movie was set, the population of Australia was NOT 17 million. You're about 3 million short. Now, 3 million may not seem like a lot in a country such as, say, China. But 3 million would be more than one seventh of our population. That's a huge factual error in my opinion, and one that could have been easily resolved by 2 minutes of research.<br/><br/>My point: If you're going to spend millions of dollars making a movie, get the facts right.<br/><br/>The attitude that was shown by Luther and Ethan towards ""this guy"" (the Australian) was horribly arrogant. The Aussie was cast as a damn painful fool that the other characters seemed to look down upon. But the real foolishness was the presumption that we could or should believe half of the outrageously far-fetched action sequences crammed into this pointless film."

","Mission: Impossible 2 is loaded with stunts. From the very first sequence, this movie is jam-packed with action and gravity-defying stunts. Too much for its own good, as a matter of fact.<br/><br/>First of all, let's start with the simple fact that Tom Cruise cannot act that well. He's decent, but never convincing in his role. His romantic interest, played by Thandie Newton, was absolutely horribly cast! I've never heard such unnaturally stressed sentences before! The only bright spot in the entire cast is Dougray Scott as the villain. The rest of the cast is either flat-out terrible or just mediocre.<br/><br/>Now the plot: it was O.K. Trouble is, it called for one trick far too often. Countless times during the film, someone puts on a flesh mask and with an electronic device alter their voices, and pass themselves off as someone else. Now, the first time this was done, it was flat-out great! But by the time people began impersonating dead people, it got far too predictable and asinine.<br/><br/>John Woo's direction? He focused mainly on the stunts, which I have to admit, were pretty good. But he's no ""acclaimed action director"" like it says on the back of the DVD box. He's a second unit who got lucky!<br/><br/>Yes, I was fooled by the nice DVD box that this was a movie worth buying. I hope no one else makes the same mistake."
"elshikh4","5","0","2","29 January 2009"," Goofy Little Bond !
","It's not bad, it's only goofy!<br/><br/>(Tom Cruise) was having the worst of times, in 2 years he didn't make anything but (Kubrick)'s big turkey (Eyes Wide Shut - 1999), and it wasn't worth it too!, needing a box office hit badly. So how about the great TV show that he participated in disfiguring it 4 years ago under the name of (Mission: Impossible) or (The adventures of James Bond's short American brother). Therefore, let's make (Disfiguring: Part 2)!<br/><br/>(John Woo) seems so happy to work with Mr. Hollywood (Tom Cruise) himself, directing a Mission Impossible flick (it's like having the American citizenship!), being on a mission to rescue (Cruise) from the bomb that (Eyes Wide Shut) was, at any cost. But (Woo) here was more like a director of nearly 10 video clips, showing off his technique, enjoying creating something visually catchy at every one of them, though they are still clips. The real problem was that he freely gave everyone and everything a bigger shadows, so with smaller script; they seemed all funny!<br/><br/>OK, for instance, he was highly sentimental in the wrong place, or by the wrong way; (Cruise) falls in love with (Thandie Newton) during a Spanish dance in slow-motion like living a poem, rolling on a cliff at their cars like a ballet, both make love while some public exuberant ceremony, Oh like fate is conducting the relationship as heavenly music, or a great rapt love that was meant to be. Surely (Cruise) will dump her like trash before she knows about it in the next movie! It runs in the family, as his older English brother used to do during 40 years already. The funniest bit when (Cruise) had to hug her at one park in the end, after he saved the world, while no sound around them but the holy moment of their true love; Oh Nonsense!<br/><br/>The script wasn't respectable enough. Look at the first scene that gathered the 2 leads together (the attempt to steal at the hotel), the script just cut the scenes where we're supposed to understand that (Cruise)'s character is disguising as security's manager just to get right to the action part! Actually it looked naïve, before anticlimactic. But not to wonder. As (Robert Towne) had declared that much of his script was written around action scenes that (Woo) told him he wanted to direct?? That makes clear that this was the most toy of a movie for (Woo).<br/><br/>Let alone how (Cruise) is not that convincing as Bond, or as action hero in the first place, whatever all the moves he does, all the motorcycles he rides, and all the sunglasses in the world! I even can't believe that he may be a result of an affair for (Bond)'s father in America with some short girl; he's close to be a (Bond)'s son only by correspondence! So, farewell for any credibility (read: unity with the lead).<br/><br/>I hated that Russian scientist character who got nothing to do but saying one of the drama's rules ""Every search for a hero must begin with something that every hero requires; a villain!"", (Thandie Newton) was here only for being ""the girl"", though she didn't have enough charisma or charm. It got more ironic while the way she was portrayed cinematically like a dream. To add all the fuel, there was no whit of chemistry between her and (Cruise), like they were a team of (Bud Abbott) and (Bud Abbott)! So, for me, one of the movie's highest absurd points was seeing the good guy and the evil guy, fighting madly over her. Fairly, I think she's a real good actress, but she didn't fit for nearly everything in this.<br/><br/>So, the script is a little childish, and with (Cruise)'s presence, plus (Woo) being seriously romantic in a video game, it's ""very"" childish. The whole matter shrank into another crazy B-movie with shattering glass, cool yet fool chases, and one long jump into one building, managing not to be a spy movie, or kind of decent thriller like Part 1, or a case of ""one-team, one-mission"" a la' the original TV show which was originally murdered since the beginning, and nothing remained from it else the game of the masks! Even the director's trademarks, such as the slow-motion during the action, seemed silly, meaninglessly repetitive, and sometimes laughable with the doves while (Cruise) rises; it looked like a perfect spoof indeed especially with that operatic soundtrack!<br/><br/>I'm sick of reading information like ""The film's final cut clocked in at 3-1/2 hours. So the studio balked, and the final length was abbreviated to 120 min""! I read the same thing about other flops like (The Avengers - 1998), or (Daredevil - 2003). It's flimsy excuse for the plot holes, and flimsier excuse to sell the DVD!<br/><br/>Lastly, what could be good in this? I'll tell you: The sunglasses part at the intro for its novelty; I've been totally surprised when a lot of viewers loved it and still remember it + The guitar music at the Spanish dance + (Anthony Hopkins) as the ""uncredited"" Mission Commander (Swanbeck); in moments like these you long for someone who can act, someone you know by heart that he has a meaning!<br/><br/>(Mission: Impossible II) is suitable for 2 mindless hours, if you can stand its formula's elements, and (Cruise) being on black motorcycle, wearing black jacket, black sunglasses (How can he aim right, then?!), while his long black hair is flying in slow-motion. It's not (James Bond) nor (Mission: Impossible); it's an Impossible Bond!"
"hnt_dnl","3","0","2","3 November 2008"," Inferior sequel
","John Woo has directed some good movies (FACE OFF, BROKEN ARROW), but MISSION:IMPOSSIBLE 2 isn't one of them. MI2 is the stylistic opposite of the brilliant, underrated ""original"" MISSION:IMPOSSIBLE (directed by the great Brian DePalma), which managed to maintain the claustrophobic tone and mood of the original MI 1960's TV series whilst updating it with all the modern techno gadgets and still be full throttle excitement. MI2 is a classic example of a sequel that doesn't live up to the original. Big surprise.<br/><br/>Quite often in Hollywood, sequels are directed by completely different directors with mixed results (JAWS 2, DIE HARD 2, THE BOURNE SUPREMACY, the post-Burton BATMAN movies, EMPIRE STRIKES BACK). OK, the last example (EMPIRE) is a film considered (by some) superior to its predecessor (STAR WARS), but c'mon! There's still a large contingent of folks that prefer the fun, no-holds-barred, in-your-face action of STAR WARS to the downbeat, serious tone of EMPIRE, myself included. MI and MI2 is a good example of this. While original MI (made in 1996) is pure entertainment and fast-paced fun, this movie MI2 is overlong, dull in many parts, and really a standard Hollywood action flick.<br/><br/>The always-reliable Tom Cruise is sadly stuck in this tripe that continues the sage of our hero Ethan Hunt as he is on holiday mountain-climbing when new IMF chief (played by unbilled Anthony Hopkins, who is not in the film enough for me). A rogue IMF agent Sean Ambrose (played by a not-too-scary Dougray Scott), disguised as Hunt in one of those masks made famous in the original film, has stolen the antidote for the chimera virus from a doctor friend of Ethan's and plans to sell it on the black market, but first he must steal the virus itself to use it on a major population (Sydney, Australia to be exact, the primary setting of most of the film's action). The cure is no good without something to cure! That pretty much sums it up, except for a dull love story between Hunt and three-named master jewel thief Nyah Nordoff-Hall (played by the beautiful Thandie Newton). I'm sorry, but sex and love stories ruin good action films and this one drags it down. The original kept things simple and the love story (such as it was) to a bare minimum; this one should have as well. There is all this sappy background music while we watch Hunt take down the bad guys near the end flashing between Hunt and Nyah dying from the disease that Ambrose has infected her with as part of his revenge (Nyah dumped Ambrose before she fell for Hunt). A love triangle in an MI action flick? Good times!*cough*BEING SARCASTIC*cough! When watching it, I was thinking of the total ripoff of Hitchcock's greatest films (secret agent gets party girl that he secretly loves to do the government's bidding by using sex, a la NOTORIOUS; but the most obvious ripoffs are from the classic NORTH BY NORTHWEST: double agent female caught between 2 lovers, dangerous mountain scenes and chases, 2nd-in-command to the big bad guy with an unnatural, possibly-more-than-platonic connection to his boss and of course guarded of him and suspects the femme fatale is up to no good, etc., etc.<br/><br/>Also the action itself is that standard slo-mo John Woo stuff. Slow-moving motorcycles, slow-moving fight scenes, slow-moving bullets. Boring, boring, boring. And when I watch a movie with really bad guys like these (infecting a major population with a deadly virus), I LOVE to hate their guts, but for some reason, I couldn't muster up barely an ounce of hatred for these guys. I guess they really didn't scare me all that much. Jon Voight was a much more scary, diabolical villain in MI; I as the viewer really enjoyed watching him get his in the end; when Scott got his here, I just didn't care. Pretty much sums up my feeling about MI2."

Even though this is a sequel, it completely veers away from the paranoia seen in the first film and gives us a shot of adrenaline. It begins with Ethan Hunt being given a new mission while on vacation. The mission entails recruiting a thief, Naya,(Thandie Newton) to infiltrate one of Ethan's old operatives who's stolen an important virus and it's antidote with the intention of infecting the population and selling to the highest bidder. Everything goes good until it doesn't and Ethan enlists the help of some friends (Ving Rhames and John Polson) to help him steal and destroy the virus. The movie is directed by John Woo and that means all kinds of impossible acrobatics from pistols to motorcycles to hand to hand combat. The action in this movie delivers, not giving us a boring minute. The spy aspect of the movie plays its necessary part but doesn't overshadow the action.

","MI2 starts of with a scene which sums up the whole movie. It is an immediate warning that this is NOT Mission Impossible. Whatever you do, don't watch this film in the hope of another story of betrayal and mystery. Instead this is a film of action and is more likely to interest fans of James Bond than MI.<br/><br/>The problem with Mission Impossible 2 is that it starts well but soon slows down to a crawl as the story is built up, this does serve as an introduction to the story but after a couple of viewings this part of the film becomes tedious. In fact when i am watching this film i often find myself skipping these bits in order to get to the end.<br/><br/>It is the second half of the film where the film works it's magic, starting with a tribute to MI1's most famous scene. The film from here on in is full of emotion and action (As well as a clever twist). these scenes are also lent a hand by an amazing soundtrack composed by Hans Zimmer.<br/><br/>However another thing that you must be ready for if your going to watch this film is that this film is by no means original (evil man gets virus)in fact it is often comparable to James Bond (especially the car duel at the start which stinks of Bond's duel with Xenia Onatopp in Goldeneye) This film is by no means groundbreaking and doesn't deserve to win any awards but it does provide a reasonable story (although slightly overdone) combined with some brain and a lot of brawn.<br/><br/>7/10"

There is hardly a denying that it makes scenes vivid and exstatic, in it's own way.<br/><br/>The action was pretty good too. Coming from a master of action like John Woo, wo would expect otherwise.

A crying shame, if you ask me, because you could certainly smell something of a classic through the silliness that had this movie.<br/><br/>But I still liked it. I liked it because it was edited so energetic, so vibrant, with so much allure and elegance brought to screen, that it is hard for me not to like it, and I forgive them for a lot of his faults and plot holes for that reason.

"oneloveall","5","0","1","28 October 2006"," Outstanding mediocrity
","Technical extravaganza, helmed by violence artist John Woo, for better or worse subverts any intention this movie has to be taken seriously in the slightest, and in turn provides some pretty spiffy action entertainment. Offering stark counterpoint to Brian De Palma's more grounded, practical minded, more serious original, Woo seizes the opportunity to bask in this cash cow franchise with some of his most ludicrous, surreal, and fascinating choreography and stuntwork to date, all under the blanket, of course, of the certifiably generic script. Complete with viruses, bitter ex-agents and femme fatals, MI2's weak plot won't matter much once the insanely over-the-top tone soaks in. While detailing some of the particulars leading up to the convoluted action might not be his strong point, Woo definitely manages to make some of the scenes exude far more sensuality then they have any right to be (the help of luscious Thandie Newton does not hurt), and while Cruise's ""bad in black"" shtick might not have stuck, the impressive lensing makes even this look badass."

","Wow, that was lame -- even for me. I'm so sorry.<br/><br/>John Woo bravely takes on this second installment of the Mission Impossible trilogy and the end product is a fast-paced, mildly entertaining but completely decent action thriller. It hardly outshines Mission Impossible I, nor does it even fully do it justice -- but it is a solid film that welcomes Tom Cruise back as spy Ethan Hunt on another near-impossible mission for his..uh, agency (?). This time he is to retrieve and destroy a supply of a genetically engineered disease called ""Chimera"", and using his newfound sweetie (Thandie Newton) as bait, his quest is shadowed by personal concerns. <br/><br/>OK, so Mission Impossible II is -- like its title -- a tad predictable and seems to want to make up for its lack of clever twists by introducing specialized masks that the characters wear and whenever it gets too predictable, they simply pull off this mask to reveal A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT identity! This borders on silly and desperate as the film progresses, but damn, it's still quality. After all, it is full of gems like Ethan effortlessly picking up a 600 pound motorcycle with one arm, and Ethan swinging his entire body weight from one cliff to the other, again using only one arm!<br/><br/>Dougray Scott is a superbly sexy villain but Thandie Newton (of the horrorshow ""Crash"") simply does not deliver, but rather relies on a cute face and a demure smile. It appears that John Woo has picked up on Newton's non-talent in this role and desperately tries to compensate for it with a big, overblown, wailing, ethnic score in the background whenever she attempts a dramatic performance. Embarrassing.<br/><br/>Other than this, seriously people, what's the big deal? Or is this simply a combination of 'betrayed' fans of the first film and Tom Cruise-haters giving all of his films a ""1""? It deserves more than a 5/10 rating on IMDb because it truly is very entertaining as an action film, balancing depth and violence in a way that, I thought, could not be done better with its script.<br/><br/>6/10"

It was really disappointing after the first Mission Impossible film, which had a definite plot, compelling actors, riveting sequences, colorful locales, and many surprises. The first Mission Impossible seemed connected to the old TV series, although, in that respect it does take a strange turn. I bought the video and considerate it a classic. The second MI completely ran away from its source after the first scene with Ethan on the mountain getting his instructions. (This is what the preview showed that brought me to see it in the first place.) It could have been any stupid, mindless action film after that. I could not relate to or see any point to the romance---was not titillated or fascinated by the black-white pairing (Is the general public still salivating over that clichÃ©?) By the half way mark, I had lost faith in anything good developing, and stopped paying much attention. I went to this site originally because I was trying to figure out whether the current MI (#3) is worth spending time/money on. And I ended up here. I couldn't resist adding my opinion to what seems to be the general consensus about MI-II. I'm sorry there really isn't much more to say. A turkey. Should I bother to see Mission Impossible III?"

It has everything: proper plot - world threatening danger, car/bike chasing, great fight scenes (slowed down in short intervals so one can really enjoy the choreography), hi-tech gadgets, love worth risking your life, perfectly composed and aligned music scores and final showdown between the hero and villain. The last is very characteristic for John Woo and is one of his best trademarks (see Hart Target, Face Off, Paycheck). Certain scenes, where music and heart-beats substitute words and sound effects, are simply perfect and unsurpassed for an action movie. As for the actors, the cast is right on the spot, Tom Cruise is at its best, and Thandie Newton is so natural and has such realistic appeal she is surreal. Even the dialogs are never over the top.

I just wonder why there are some people who hate him and getting annoyed to him. Maybe they are only envy or they are really just different. But I can say also that there are scenes in the movie that are actually impossible to happen (hence, mission: impossible) and to perform in real life. It's just really a fiction and good for movies/entertainment only. Oh what the hell am I talking about. I also noticed that some people called Cruise as 'pathetic', which I also does. It seems that Cruise just only want to portray his being hero in the films he stars. It does look pathetic, doesn't it?"

","... Without the positive factors featured in the original attraction, which featured a nice plot full of (though perhaps slight standard) plot twists, gadgets, computers, etc. None of that in this movie however, since Mission: Impossible II is, in contradiction with its prequel, an action-movie with little thought. The plot involves a virus and a medicine, and if you haven't fallen asleep by then, you'll probably figure everything out in the first half-hour.<br/><br/>The movie is, as said, far more based on the ""Lights, Camera, Action, No-brain""-idea, and that action is mainly Tom Cruise basically saying: ""Look at me, I'm doin' all this impossible stuff and I'm coooool!"". And it sucks. I've seen 50ct acting less ""cool"" in his music-clips. The action is way too far over the top and that, together with the lack of a good plot and its plot twists, ensured that I was watching the movie with a feeling that was mostly based on exclamations as: ""bull, you can't do that!"", ""oooh, look at me, I'm sooooo tough"" and ""yeah yeah yeah, I don't want these James Bond like love-scenes!"".<br/><br/>As most sequels, this certainly has to bend over for the prequel, due to the overload of ""coolness""."

I love this film. Though the plot itself isn't overly excellent, it is well acted, especially by Dougray Scott, who definitely made his character (the villain) his own.

We watched it last night and have already put it on a garage sale pile.<br/><br/>I think the casting was adequate although I was hoping to see some continuity from the first movie (more than 2 characters) and possibly some recognizable star names. The plot concept was decent as well although it was rehashed via dialogue throughout the movie. These were not my issues with the movie.<br/><br/>I had trouble following some aspects of the movie (holes) while other scenes dragged on and on. There were also intended surprises/shockers throughout the movie. However, they were so blatantly advertised that an 8-year old would see them coming. The musical score was practically a neon sign advertising them as well. They were also were used so many times that the movie looked like a one-trick pony.<br/><br/>One other issue - martial arts.

"Boba_Fett1138","6","0","1","30 April 2004"," Disappointing, even as an action movie.
","The main problem with ""Mission: Impossible II"" is the simple and uninteresting story that is filled with many plot holes.<br/><br/>Not even John Woo can save this movie but at least he still makes it interesting to watch. His style is wonderfully present and the action scene's are truly a work of art. The use of slow motion is superb!<br/><br/>Apart from the story the movie also suffers from several other problems. One of them is the cast. Tom Cruise is in his element again as Ethan Hunt but Dougray Scott plays a stereotype villain, he does it in a good way but it's just too simple. I like Richard Roxburgh villain role much better. John Polson's character Billy Baird is nothing short of irritating and on top of that unnecessary. Other problem is that there is absolutely no chemistry between Cruise and Thandie Newton's character, which is I think mainly to blame on the boring and not so talented Newton.<br/><br/>Still there are plenty of elements present that make this movie worth watching. Like I said before, all of the action sequences are superb and feel like poetry in motion. The cool soundtrack from Hans Zimmer also make the movie a lot more pleasant to watch. Also the non-stop action ending doesn't disappoint as it in the end turns into an old fashioned good vs. bad guy, mano a mano fight without any weapons. I also quite enjoyed Anthony Hopkin's uncredited small role as mission commander Swanbeck.<br/><br/>Disappointing, especially compared to the first movie but still somewhat watchable because of the Woo-ism.

"Old Joe","Null","0","1","4 February 2004"," In my opinion, this is still one of the worst movies of the new millennium!
","Contains Spoilers!! Mission Impossible 2 is a film that suffered from the pretense that it believed it was a good film. Unfortunately, this moviegoer was tricked into thinking that it would be an 'unreal' film. How wrong I was, as I had a very negative experience, as I found it boring for the most part. I have to ask, why is that Hollywood cannot get the 'Mission Impossible' formula the way I like it?<br/><br/>The world's greatest spy, Ethan Hunt is partnering up with the beautiful Nyah Hall to stop renegade agent Sean Ambrose from releasing a new kind of terror on an unsuspecting world. But before the mission is complete they'll traverse the globe and have to choose between everything they love and everything they believe in.<br/><br/>I was truly disappointed in the direction that MI2 was given. John Woo (from the brilliant action thriller Face/Off), was the man in charge, and I believe he was the wrong man for this job. He really over did many things in this film. But the most overdone and frustrating part of the film for me, has to be the way Woo just had to keep showing things in slow motion. If Woo had done these shots a few times that would have been ok, but he had to do umpteen times.<br/><br/>However Woo got the right look to the film. The shots of the mountain tops, the Aussie landscape which included the outback and of Australian city, Sydney, really did impress me. Woo had cinematographer Jeffery L. Kimball doing this aspect of the movie, and visually I found nothing wrong to the film.<br/><br/>The same cannot be said for the script of MI2, which once again was disappointing. The story was the inspiration of Ronald D. Moore and Brannon Braga, different men to the first MI film. However the screenplay writer, Robert Towne was back for a second shot at this story. Unfortunately all these writers got this story totally wrong again. I believe this because of the crazy plot, which involves the silly virus, just not good enough. Then with this as the sole focus of the story, we get another story that becomes very complex, confusing and at times rather boring. Another complaint in this story has to be the character creations, which are pathetic, especially the bad guys, who are not convincing at all.<br/><br/>Main character of MI2 is Ethan Hunt (Producer Tom Cruise). As I have mentioned previously, Cruise certainly looks the part in these films, and while he was ok in the role of Hunt this time, I still think he needs more MIF members to help counterbalance the film's spy aspects. Hunt's mentor in the film is Mission Commander Swanbeck (Sir Anthony Hopkins), who was well casted in his small role.<br/><br/>The female lead in MI2 is Nyah Hall (the gorgeous Thandie Newton). She is a professional thief recruited to help Hunt on his mission. We learn that Hall used to be romantically involved with a defective agent. Nyah is asked to do a very dangerous job, one that could cost her life. Luther (Ving Rhames) is again an ok character, but he does not have a great affect on me. But a funny new man was Billy Baird (John Polson), who has a very over exaggerated Australian accent, but for some reason I did not mind that.<br/><br/>The bad guy here is a man by the name of the Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott), who is not a nice man at all. He is driven to get his hands on this new deadly virus, and noting will stop him from getting it. Ambrose is a pathetic bad guy, poorly acted by Scott, as he did not get me overawed like a good bad guy can and should do. Ambrose's right hand man is also just as bad. His name is Hugh Stamp (Richard Roxburgh) and knowing that this guy is Australian, he has a terrible accent all the way through this movie.<br/><br/>
MI2 has some good sequences and some very bad sequences. I enjoyed the start as it opened the movie up nicely. But after the race course scenes, the film gets lost in a rather boring sequence, where Hunt is trying to get a hold of the deadly virus guns. This scene is bad reminder for me, as it is just like the vault scene in the first MI film.<br/><br/>Yet the ending does make up for some of this film's short falls. The bike/car chase is really well shot, but unfortunately John Woo had to overuse the slow mo shots which ruined it for me a little. Then the final confrontation between Hunt and Ambrose was fine, up until a point where see a knife held extremely close to Hunt's eyeball. Now these shots are supposed totally thrill us as the audience, but once again they did not work on me.<br/><br/>
I also want to give my opinion on this movie's marketing. I feel that it was crap the way that they made the film look so much cooler and better than actually was, mainly via its trailer. The whole glasses thrown at the screen really did build this film up, but in retrospect, I find it to be totally 'wanky'. I am now very careful not to get the right or wrong impression of a movie via its promotion and or trailer, mainly because of MI2.<br/><br/>I have learned that they are doing a Mission Impossible 3 very soon. As big a film as it will be, I will not be seeing it cinema, after the bad and bitter experience I had of watching this film in the cinema. I am unsure if I will ever like a Hollywood inspired 'Mission Impossible' film, because for some reason the powers behind each individual film does not do, what I relate to being in the MI story. I guess time will only tell.<br/><br/>

","WARNING: May Contain Spoilers<br/><br/>     John Woo excels at pushing the envelope of both excitement and hyperbole in action films, but he doesn't handle emotion very well. Although certain scenes in ""Mission Impossible II"" don't fail to dazzle the explosion craving psyche, the entire movie has a hopelessly contrived foundation.  The characters are cliches, the plot recycled, and the dialogue is hammy as it comes.  A revelry of stuntwork, explosions and chases, but nothing more.<br/><br/>     Tom Cruise gives his good looks, but not much else to the role of Ethan Hunt.  Whereas the original Mission Impossible contained intelligence and mystery, Cruise is forced to work within the slap-bang action hero mold. Dougray Scott is the typical insidious ex-secret agent turned renegade.  His overpunctuation of his lines is grievously apparent, and his one dimensional character practically telegraphs his direction and fate.  Thandie Newton, although extremely beautiful, is reduced to the ""hold me, hero"" love interest role for Tom Cruise.  Her character starts out as a highly capable and interesting professional thief, but degrades very quickly.  I don't even know why Anthony Hopkins was in this movie, but his role was tiny enough that it doesn't need to be discussed.<br/><br/>     The plot is blatantly recycled.  A deadly virus is created and bad guys steal it, prompting a secret agent to be sent in order to get it back.  The scenes proceed in a stop/go fashion to the extreme, and hardly any tension is produced at all.  The chase scenes, though visually pleasing are predictable and rather over-the-top.  I'm normally not such a cynic when it comes to action movies, but couldn't any idiot in his right mind have hit Cruise with at least one bullet?  The kill ratio must have been about 80-0.<br/><br/>     On the positive side, the locations were actually quite excellent.  The opening scene with Tom Cruise in the Moab Desert, dangling from a cliff face hundreds of feet high was very striking.  Also, the Spanish flamenco and candle-lit procession scenes exhibited very impressive lighting techniques. Woo's action sequences, though hideously hyperbolic at times, still display a degree of art.  In interviews, Woo has said that he retains some romantic visions in his films, such as how the motorcycle duel between Cruise and Scott mimicked a jousting competition between medieval knights.  I'm not about to challenge his contention, but he certainly has done better in his other films.<br/><br/>     In sum, this movie isn't bad, but it's certainly not good.  Its simple plot, mega star actor, and flashy effects were enough to make it a blockbuster in 2000, but certainly not enough to make it memorable.  If you're an action fan, you could give it a rent, but there are many other fine action films which are more deserving of your view."

","There are no stars in Hollywood that could ever lay claim to making a career, comprised of only Good movies. The career of Arnie looked indestructible, until someone handed him the script of LAST ACTION HERO. Tom Cruise is one such star. He has made some great movies - TOP GUN, MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE, MINORITY REPORT - but for every TOP GUN, there is a DAYS OF THUNDER.  After the huge success of the first M:I film, made in 1995 and seen by audiences far too young to actually remember the original '60s series, a sequel was inevitable, unless presumably, Cruise was suddenly killed in a freak accident. After much speculation about plot, writers, co-stars, and directors (including, shudder, Oliver Stone), John Woo was chosen to sit in the shouting chair. Woo seemed the perfect choice. He had breathed new life in the tired Western action genre with FACE/OFF, and his Hong Kong movies are jaw-dropping to say the least. A partnership with Woo, Cruise, and a hundred million dollars seemed like heaven. Shame it didn't work. Learning the lesson from the first film, writer Robert Towne (CHINATOWN), doesn't make the plot too complex. Was I the only one left in the cinema after the Brian de Palma original, scratching my head and wondering who was alive and who was dead and who was the double-agent and who was... However, the story is still pretty complicated. It involves a deadly man-made virus, which rogue MIF agent Sean Ambrose (Dougary Scott) wants to steal. Our floppy-haired hero Ethan Hawke (Cruise) is sent on his trail by a heart-attack inducing cameo by Anthony Hopkins. Hawke decides to infiltrate Ambrose's gang, by planting the villain's ex, Nya (Thandie Newton) by his side.  Of course, the plot is just a skeleton for Woo and his special effects team to flesh some supposedly eye-popping action scenes on. There are some scenes which had great potential - the lab. shoot out in particular, but nothing quite hits the mark, mainly due to the frustrating amount of times slo-mo is used - we all know this (and doves) are Woo's signatures, but this time he really grinds it in the ground and in fact loses much of the drama because of it.  The opening cliff-scaling venture is well done, and the duel to the death on the beach is exciting, but none of them have the rewatchability of, say, FACE/OFF or THE KILLER. Cruise's mullet is irritating to the point of hurling a petrol bomb at the screen, and although both Scott and Newton are good, there are seriously wasted. The script is dreadful - it is hard to believe that it was written by the same guy who wrote the classic CHINATOWN, but that's Hollywood, eh?  This redefines the term 'missed opportunity.' A great director,  a charismatic star, and a brilliant writer still could not make a passable movie. It is not that M:I-2 is woefully bad, like THE AVENGERS, but it is not a mark on the 1995 film, which wasn't perfect by a long chalk. M:I-2 is the worst a movie can ever be - mediocre. It will never rise to fame because of its ghastliness, and yet it will never be hailed as a cinema milestone.<br/><br/> Turgid, bloated and as disappointing as cinema has ever been, this must rank among HANNIBAL and THE MATRIX RELOADED as films that could have had everything, but chickened out at the last minute."

","What the hell were the fighting scenes all about in this movie? I like the Matrix, but correct me if I'm wrong but this movie is not set in the Matrix. The fighting scenes are laughable. No gritty drama anymore. It's evident in all the movies in Hollywood now, Bollywood fight scenes where one guy flies around kicking everyone's butts with dumb moves. But apart from that the dialogue was poor, the plot paper-thin, no strong characterization. This is definitely a film which has relied on style over content. Pity there's not much style. 2 out of 10, and I'm being generous."

","Tom Cruise and John Woo do not mix.  The former is too full of himself and spends too much time ""grinning like an idiot every 15 minutes"" (except in Rain Man) whereas the latter is more concerned about style and pomp.  These are colliding worlds. Enter ""Mission: Impossible 2"" the second, and sadly not the last, in this franchise.  I knew there was something wrong when they structured the story AROUND the action scenes instead of vice-versa.  My biggest complaint is that this is not a ""Mission: Impossible"" movie, this is a James Bond/Matrix/John Woo movie.  Very little of the conservativeness of the original remains (if any).<br/><br/>John Woo's directing goes back to his trademarks, but does not retain his original style.  Whereas ""A Better Tomorrow"" and ""The Killer"" were incredible action experiences throughout, this winds up to be a waste of an hour and then trying to make up for it. Even the villains aren't up to par.  Whatever happened to supervillain Castor Troy?  I for one got sick of Tom Cruise's pomp and wished that someone would just run him over with an 18-wheeler in the motorcycle chase. Imagine how much pain the audience would've been spared.<br/><br/>Overall, lacks in all departments, particularly direction.  Come back, Woo, return to your bloody roots!  1 out of 5 stars."

","It's about time John Woo got back to making movies, rather than two-hour-long self-tributes. I used to be a fan when he put the moviegoing audience first and he gave us some great actioners when he first arrived in Hollywood (e.g. Broken Arrow, Hard Target). And for the first 20 minutes, in the initial scenes and those in Seville, it seemed like Mr Woo was back on form. Not for long.<br/><br/>This, like Face/Off, seems a demonstration of Mr Woo believing the reason he was hired was to showcase his style. Either that or he is afraid we might miss his style, so we're force-fed it. It's not that I don't appreciate his genius, but I can only take so much of slow-motions, close-ups and two-gun Tommy getting in the way of the story's flow. Call me old-fashioned.<br/><br/>With the greatest respect to a fellow southerner, Mr Woo's best recent work was his BMW commercial, The Hire: Hostage, starring Clive Owen. Watch that about 13 times back to back and it's a better way of getting the same quantity of John Woo style than trying to make head or tail of this Hollywood-moneyed insult to Bruce Geller's memory. The only sign of this film being distinguished was Tony Hopkins's brief presence as the IMF boss.<br/><br/>Oh, it's nothing to do with the TV series. But you knew that."

The first movie shared the spotlight a lot more than this Hollywood piece of trash. The original 1996 had its faults too but captured the feeling of the series. It had more team situations.

It's just  one big ego-trip for Tom Cruise. He is the  über-James Bond, doing all this amazing stuff, killing a lot of people in the process and of course  getting the girl in the end.<br/><br/>This movie combines the worst  recent Hollywood action movies have to offer : totally unbelievable action scenes, an almost complete lack of   plot, and a hero escaping all this mayhem with barely a scratch. One of the most ridiculous scenes features Cruise on  a motorcycle being chased by an armada of cars  full of guys shooting at him with machine guns. Imagine this in real life, only one bullet has to hit either him or the cycle and its quits. And what about the mask changing thing again, the lame romance, Anthony Hopkins (?) and so on. Halfway the movie I just started rooting for the bad guys.<br/><br/>I never liked much John Woo's movies.  I have not seen any of his earlier Hong-Kong made films but I am sure it has a high bodycount.  I even didn't enjoy the much hyped Face-off, which I'll admit had a clever premise, but finally resulting  in the same ridiculous shoot-outs.<br/><br/>I'll give it a 3 (though it deserves a 1) , for  the camerawork and the stuntdoubles."

","Mission: Impossible II is sometimes unfairly criticized, for being a sequel to Mission: Impossible, instead of a compliment to it such as the first two parts of the Godfather trilogy. But it is a sequel to Mission: Impossible, so that alone is unfair, and in its own way it does compliment the original.<br/><br/>The real problem with the film is that the plot, although quite well developed and effective, is too similar to the first Mission: Impossible and too predictable. I saw Mission: Impossible and Mission: Impossible II in reverse order, so for me the plot was new, and when I saw the first installment later, I was a little disappointed. To me, that says that the film itself is not that flawed, but its downfall is in the fact that it is a sequel, and everyone had seen it already.<br/><br/>However, its a fun film to watch, although its not very relaxing as you have to keep watching carefully right from the beginning so as not to miss the plot. The stunts arent bad, and Tom Cruise, Dougray Scott and Ving Rhames are all on top form. Thandie Newton doesnt convince me.<br/><br/>The verdict is dont go out of your way to avoid this film, but dont go too far out of your way to see it.

","I loved the first film when it came out- although it had a very complex story and required you to watch it more than once, it was sheer heart-thumping suspense. Therefore, I couldn't wait until the sequel came out- which I ended up going to see at the cinema twice in the first week it was released. I even bought the video when that came out, and last month, I bought the DVD.<br/><br/>After getting hold of the original on DVD in the last few days and being able to revisit it again- I can now see what a pathetic piece of something-not-nice it's sequel really is. For a start, Ethan Hunt in M:I-2 is *not* the Ethan Hunt in M:I, he's grown his hair as well as his sexual appetite and has become completely unbelievable. The token British bad guy is just as awful, Dougray Scott cannot act in this role and makes a mockery of everything that came in the previous film. The direction from John Woo is all style and certainly no substance, two cars spinning around next to each other in slow-motion? Nah, I'm not quite seeing it to be honest. The music is laughably bad- but complements the film well because of this. They've transformed the signature M:I theme (the only thing the films and the original TV series have in common, really) into a thumping guitar-fueled rock track which is suitably abysmal. And while some of the action sequences are risable, none of them as much as come close to the first film's modest array of nail-biting near misses. Nothing beats the sheer thrill of Ethan Hunt jumping from a high-speed bullet train onto the bottom of a helicopter as the M:I theme begins.<br/><br/>Thank God one of my favourite directors of recent times (the sublimely talented David Fincher) is close to signing up for the third instalment- I have no doubt he will pick up the series from where the first one ended. Fincher hasn't disappointed me yet, and I doubt he ever will.<br/><br/>Overall Score: 4/10"

Not to mention the fact that this movie tries way too hard to be cool, rather than focusing on the plot and character development.<br/><br/>First off, Tom Cruise looks awful with long hair.  I'm sorry, but that just doesn't look like the Ethan Hunt I remember.  Heck, Ethan Hunt is a totally different character in this one.  In the first Mission:  Impossible, Hunt was serious about his job and focused only on that.  Now he's a woman-chasing, long-haired, cool guy who flashes a smile every thirty seconds or so.<br/><br/>The plot is actually as intricate as the first Mission:  Impossible.  I realized this when I saw the movie for the third time and really understood it all.  It's not explained quite as well.<br/><br/>Now that I think about it, though, this movie seems like it has nothing to do with Mission:  Impossible.  It's reverted to sex, loud guitar and crummy flamenco themes, Hunt has completely changed, and there are so many boring sequences with Ethan and Nyah that left me very angry.<br/><br/>The music is absolutely awful.  With the exception of four tracks on the CD (which are in the movie), the rest are soft, annoying flamenco guitar strings which all sound the same.  It really makes me angry how the series went from a nice beat with great drums and action music to this junk.  The main theme isn't even really the same.  It's been changed into a screaming guitar.  It does, however, sound awesome on the track called ""Bare Island"", when Ethan has presumably been killed but instead runs out and pulls off his mask.<br/><br/>M:I-2 is a completely separate story from its predecessor, which makes it that much more disappointing.  I saw this movie in theaters expecting the impossible again, but instead found an overly ""cool"" flick with too much violence.  Unlike the first, ""Zero body count!"", Hunt actually resorts to killing a bunch of innocent security guards in the laboratory.<br/><br/>All in all, M:I-2 is a major disappointment and I would not suggest seeing it unless you are a big fan of Mission:  Impossible.  Let's hope the third installment actually remembers that there were two before it.  Hunt doesn't even seem to remember his whole experience with the NOC List... and Kittridge, who played a huge part before, no longer exists.<br/><br/>Like I said, disappointing."

","John Woo's `Mission: Impossible 2' represents much that is wrong with commercial moviemaking today.  Though proficient on the levels of technical expertise, visual design and state-of-the-art special effects, the film emerges as little more than a multimillion dollar exercise in cold efficiency, devoid of humor, suspense and, above all, heart.  Thus, while countless superior films - films that attempt to make some connection with the reality of the human condition - languish at the box office, `Mission: Impossible 2' and other films if its ilk play to packed movie houses.  Do people really enjoy this film, or are they just suckered into believing that any film that is sold as an `event' picture - particularly one that stars the ubiquitous Tom Cruise - must by its nature be worth the price of admission?<br/><br/>`Mission: Impossible 2' features an opening credit sequence that proves that just because something `can' be done doesn't necessarily mean that it `should' be done - a warning filmmakers should heed now that, with computer graphics, virtually every situation imaginable has become possible to visualize convincingly.  We are reintroduced to Cruise's spy character as he is climbing up the face of a sheer cliff sans ropes or cables.  Although the shot looks absolutely convincing from a technical standpoint, we simply cannot believe that anyone in his right mind would be doing what he is doing - or even if those actions are themselves within the realm of physical possibility.  From its opening note then, `MI 2' informs us that it is not concerned in any way with making everything we see believable and involving. As a result, we tune out, detaching ourselves from the events on the screen, becoming disinterested bystanders of a trite espionage scenario that, for all its visual finesse, is strangely lacking in creativity and passion.<br/><br/>The first `Mission: Impossible' film, made in 1996, may have been a monument to incoherence, but at least it half redeemed itself by offering two spectacular and unforgettable action set pieces - Cruise's dangling marionette act and a mano-a-mano fight atop a roaring, supersonic train. The sequel offers no such action scene equivalents.  The car chase early in the film between Cruise and the sexy thief he is pursuing is a yawn-inducing bore compared to the ones in the exciting `Ronin' from a few years back. The shootouts are equally undistinguished, far below par for a Woo film.<br/><br/>
Like many films that rely so heavily on special effects and action sequences, `MI 2' never exerts the slightest effort to flesh out its many characters.  One would expect that a writer with the talent and track record of Robert Towne (he wrote `Chinatown' for heavens sake) would at least be able to provide some character dimension even within the tight confines of the action genre.  Unfortunately, all the characters emerge as cardboard cutout figures, substituting coolness and slickness for personality and depth.  Cruise and Thandie Newton generate zero chemistry in the romance department, and John Polson seems woefully inadequate as the film's main villain.<br/><br/>If you must check `MI2' out, by all means do.  Just know that there are a lot more interesting, much less heralded films out there more worthy of your time and attention."

","From the crash-bang school of LOUDER IS BETTER comes this sequel to the latest Tom Cruise blockbuster, or the Big Movie Du Jour. Not that Tom's incapable of small films (okay, maybe he is), but making a sequel to a loud action film is about as overdone as.... well, making any sequels, frankly. And we all know how good those sequels can be, don't we? (Okay, Toy Story 2 notwithstanding.)<br/><br/>You remember Ethan Hunt of the Impossible Missions Force, don't you? Last time we saw Ethan, he was having a bear of a time keeping his team alive - and finding out if they were on his side or not. This time around, he's asked by his boss (an unbilled Anthony Hopkins) to recruit a thief (Thandie Newton) to assist in some covert viral espionage. Ethan thinks the girl's being hired for her thiefing skills, but turns out she's the former lover of the stereotypical Megolomaniacal Bad Guy (who, of course, is a former colleague of Hunt), Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott). Her mission, should she choose to accept it, is to reingratiate herself with him and find out what she can about a brand-new, man-made organic virus called Chimera, after the mythological beast. Whenever an action movie tries to be authentic, it incorporates some<br/><br/>All flash and pomp, this movie has plotholes you could drive a souped-up Hummer through. With a ear-shattering soundtrack designed to make you forget the story's a bunch of hooey, M:I-2 deftly distracts its viewer. (It's even more riveting on DVD, where the sounds are even crisper.) Why have a plausible plot twist when three or four explosions will do? Sure, I'm nit-picking. That's what I do. Critics (professional or amateur) pick nits. You could certainly watch this movie and be suitably entertained. I guess it always irks me when a movie takes 90 minutes of plot and stretches it to 120 minutes by using music and explosions. And that's not to say that the action scenes aren't elaborately and masterfully staged.<br/><br/>Some of the acting is really unbelievable, including Scott and even Cruise himself. It's one of those going-through-the-motions motion pictures, albeit the kind where the star is getting $20 million and relies on special effects to bail him out. Didn't these people bother to read their lines before rehearsal? Oh wait, I forgot - there's no need for Method acting when duelling motorcycles will do. And did I mention the love scenes? Who does Cruise think he is, Sean Connery? It's bad enough M:I parrots nearly all of the Bond films regarding the international locations and explosions galore, but now Hunt has to be the Casanova to end all Casanovas. Yes, I'm quite aware he's a hunk and all that, but let's remember - he's probably shorter than you. Being in front of a camera can add inches to your height as well as to your weight!<br/><br/>You might get the impression here that I wasn't too fond of this film. Au contraire, mon frere du cinema! While it's not Shakespeare, it's also certainly not Stallone. For that, I bestow copious kudos to the filmmakers, who decided not to completely dumb it down to us. And hey, if we would rather not be distracted by a tortuous plot, so be it. So enjoy: it's solid entertainment, not too bad for a sequel."

It turned out to be perfectly possible to read same and watch the movie simultaneously, missing nothing of consequence because there was nothing of consequence.And there are the special features of the DVD, which attempt to make us believe that Cruise did all these rock stunts in Moab HIMSELF, 2000 feet in the air, with no net or rope, and made the same unbelievable jump about 15 times to get the shot right. Oh sure. Tell me another one."
"Critical Eye UK","Null","0","1","21 July 2003"," Mission Imbecilic
","SPOILERS: Concluding a short-lived movie franchise, Mission Imbecilic 2 once more sets out to entertain the average four year old and once more winds up insulting their intelligence. This time around the plot involves the theft of some valuable clichés, in which jewel thief Zeta Jones   whoops: wrong movie  is pressed into service by Cary Grant (nope: wrong movie again) to help defeat A Deranged Criminal Intent On Destroying The World (ah: originality at last!) The cast is led by a Notebook Computer, with supporting roles played by its siblings, all of whom interact in so pleasing a way that it comes as a surprise to find that John Woo and not Intel lays claim to directorial credit. Justification for MI 2 is that it's entertainment', so it doesn't really matter if everything has been seen before and done before: one should merely sit back and enjoy it, in much the same way one should enjoy being slapped repeatedly around the head with a wet haddock. The script is full of memorable 27-liners, not to mention biting humor, so that won't be mentioned, though attention ought perhaps to be drawn to the gag `If I tell you where I'm going on holiday, it wouldn't be a holiday!' not merely because it is so epically hilarious but because it merits not one but two re-runs in the movie. Laugh? We nearly went into a coma. But forget the script: movies such as this depend for their vitality on set pieces. Once the preserve of second units, stunt teams and special effects crews, today they've all been replaced by Computer Generated Images, something which Woo happily confirms in the opening minutes when people start changing their faces in much the same way they did in a film by John Woo in which  no: never mind. Shortly afterwards, Cruise stands on a chair in his bedroom and changes a light bulb, which CGI then transforms into him appearing to scale the north side of The Grand Canyon. The fact that we know he's not there, that in reality nothing is there, is a knowledge of which Woo himself seems entirely unaware, for CGI continues to be deployed throughout the rest of the movie in a way that makes everything incredible in the worst (though most accurate) sense of the word. Naturally, the high camp and high style of the original TV show is missing entirely here, because back then it was necessary to rely on good scripts and reasonable actors and competent journeymen directors (which just goes to show how tiresome it must've been in the 1960s). Woo does, however, attempt to inject some style into a CGI gun battle in Cruise's rear yard (it's made to look like a Top Secret Laboratory but hey, you can't fool us!) by dint of slashing post-production sound and overlaying it with a Hans Zimmer score that may well have been rejected 20 years ago by Michael Mann as unworthy of `Miami Vice' but which here gets full play in all its monotonic monotony.<br/><br/>On which basis, MI 2 is almost, though not quite, worth viewing: an opportunity to see a director first distance his audience from action they don't believe in then bore 'em to death with a score they were hoping never to have to hear. Rating? Well; it's a close run thing between watching MI-2 and watching non-CGI paint dry. But paint wins it so. . . 0/10. Shame, really, when MI-1 was worth one point more."

"wilz","Null","0","1","28 September 2000"," Simply the worst film ever made (contains spoilers)
","I thoroughly enjoyed the first Mission Impossible. It was probably the only film that puts you into the mind of a secret agent as he tries to uncover a conspiracy that wiped out his cohorts. It had excellent twists, who would have thought that the hero of the TV series (Jim Phelps) finally turns into the bad guy.<br/><br/>The sequel however has no plot, no interesting dialogue just mindless shootouts that would leave Gun and ballistic experts laughing in disbelief. John Woo is not a director he is a second unit director that got lucky. He cannot control his cast, he cannot convey any plot and he cannot stage believable action sequences.<br/><br/>Woo seems to be directing (if you could call it that) in his sleep. The storyline  seems to slightly mirror the original film in that a member of IMF goes rogue (not another one!!) and tries to release a Killer Virus called Chimaera on an unsuspecting world.<br/><br/>Apparently IMF Boss (Anthony Hopkins) knows the whereabouts of the Villain's hideout and orders Ethan Hunt to plant the Bad Guy's Ex girlfriend in an attempt to undermine him. (Wouldn't it have been better if they just attacked the HQ with commandos etc)<br/><br/>In the original film Ethan Hunt gets promoted to Jim Phelps rank within the organisation but in the sequel he is still a ""Point man"" jumping around in commando gear. Ving Rhames and his Australian colleague seem to do absolutely nothing in this film other than occassionally tap on a computer laptop keyboard and try to look serious. By removing the ""team"" element that made the series so great it makes the whole thing look like James Bond rather than Mission Impossible.<br/><br/>An interesting point to note is that since we know that Jim Phelp's salary was  60K PA There is no way the Rogue IMF grunt in this film could afford a massive private army along with a beach front Condo.<br/><br/>Some other laughable points in this film include:<br/><br/>The painstaking attempt by Hunt to infiltrate a building by bungee jumping down an escalator shaft while the Rogue IMF villain and his private army gingerly stroll through the front door of said building.<br/><br/>The IMF villain must be unbelievably dumb to initiate a  shootout (including explosions) with Ethan Hunt in a Virus/Chemical research lab.<br/><br/>The Second Unit Director's (Woo) laughable obsession with White Doves that seem to have more screen time than Anthony Hopkins.<br/><br/>The throat elastoplast that enables people to talk like other people including their accents (South African, Scottish, American)<br/><br/>And finally the car and motorcycle chases that seem to break the laws of physics rather than breaking the monotany of the plot.<br/><br/>It is hard to believe that it took four years of rewrites and production/ shooting to create this sorry mess. Even the soundtrack by Metallica and Limp Bizkit is absolutely Tuneless and irrelevant to the film.<br/><br/>Although it made an impressive opening weekend this film got so slated by critics and the media that it would be lucky to break even from box office takings. So do not expect an MI3 so quickly.<br/><br/>This movie will have the distinction of earning a Golden Turkey award. along with a special Turkey award for it's second unit director John Woo."
"eibon09","Null","0","1","21 September 2000"," Just as Bad as the First for Different Reasons
","Mission:Impossible 2(2000) is the polar opposite of the first film.  The first film was overly complex while this one is overly simplex.  M:I1 relied on intrigue and mystery and M:I2 relies on action.  Tom Cruise was a by the book and clean cut agent in part one and he is a long haired anything goes type of agent in part two.<br/><br/>
It surpasses Broken Arrow(1996) as one of John Woo's worst films.  His three worst films are 1.Blackjack(1998), 2.Mission:Impossible 2(2000), and Broken Arrow(1996).  The problem is that the action does not have the intensity of his top Hong Kong films.  I didn't expect the movie to be as emotionally stimulating or intensive as The Killer(1989), and Bullet in the Head(1990), but I did expect the film to be better then it was.<br/><br/>
I give the director the benefit of the doubt because I read somewhere that the director wasn't able to make his kind of movie due to the interference of the actor/producer.  Tom Cruise is a good actor but he is not an action star.  Tom Cruise as with Christian Slater in Broken arrow(1996) proved that he do not have what it takes to be an action hero.  This is the second time that the actor was in a lousy film by an excellent director(the other time was with Martin Scorsese during the making of The Color of Money-1986).<br/><br/>
M:I2 is a politically correct version of Notorious(1946) with shades of North by Northwest(1959).  Dougray Scott does ok as the main heavy.  The best sequence in the entire movie is the shootout in the lab.  I only wished that the film followed the team aspect of the show because its a concept that John Woo has dealt with before.<br/><br/>
Antony Hopkins and Thandie Newton are wasted are wasted in this film.  Tom Cruise is not Cary Grant as that actor was cool and suave.  John Woo is a talented film maker but is not in the same level as Alfred Hitchcock.  For people interested in John Woo movies, I suggest films like Heroes Shed No Tears(1983) & Just Heroes(1987)."

M:I-2 (Mission: Impossible 2)<br/><br/>
Directed by: John Woo, 1999<br/><br/>
John Woo-infested and contrived sludge. A hollow made-for-Summer movie if there ever was one, featuring product-placement overload and basically just too much of everything. <br/><br/>
The first one worked neatly so you come back smiling and wanting more. Don't. Plenty of gadgetry and plot twists can't make up for the extreme self-aware vibe. <br/><br/>Featuring ridiculous and annoying cinematography. More of a commercial or vehicle for the well-toned Tom Cruise (complete with new neck-long hair) than anything else. <br/><br/>
Woo's action sequences are (as always) impressive. However  they're also unbelievable and pretentious and it's amazing how he sticks to his guns (and own formula) not realizing how he's destroying his own legacy. Woo is for action movies what Status Quo are for classic rock bands; numbly beating the same old horse because it still pays the bills.<br/><br/>
M:I-2 qualifies as brainless and uninspired box office flubber. Only the soundtrack offers a glimmer of hope as Limp Bizkit do a slamming job on the theme song (listed as Take A Look Around)."

Less than half way through the movie I knew there's too much slow motion shots and that just ain't cool.  It becomes annoying.  The shots are all too close up, up to the face kinds of shot, and that ain't too good either, especially for the action sequence.  Plus too many of those slowing down during an action scence, for example the car chase Tom chases the girl, when their two cars got close and it slow motions then the boy looks into the girl's eyes, plus that music, oh man is it nasty!

Unfortunately what I saw was the most insipid, boring, predictable manure of a movie that amounted to a total waste of two full hours of my life.  Here's some points: The good:  1)Thandie Newton is hot The bad:  1) ""mask"" charade becomes extremely predictable as a remarkably stupid and convenient plot device 2) Thandie's ""thief"" character is dumb enough to continue her theft in the beginning of the movie despite the fact that some unknown man (Cruise) has stumbled upon her. 3) Sean, Thandie's ""ex"" and the idiotic bad guy in this movie, is dumb enough to tell his assistant that he doesn't care if Naya is spying on him as long as he gets some play.  He emphasizes this by chopping his assistant's fingertip. 4) A virus that ""incubates"" with ""direct sunlight""?? Anyone with any scientific knowledge at all will burst out laughing!! 5) Slow motions scenes were poorly fit in the context: for example they are appropriate at some tragic climax to a movie, not every two minutes. 6)  The longest fight scene i've ever scene between two wimps who you know couldn't kick a chicken's ass in real life. (Cruise and the villain). 7) Doves??  What the hell?  I think Woo had some left over from ""Face Off"" 8) the most poorly edited scene i've seen in a LONG time:  in the previously mentioned fight scene, the villain gets on top of Cruise with a dagger pointed one inch above his eye.  Cruise then grabs the villain's arm, then in the next shot we see that the knife is now 5-6 inches away from Cruise's eye, then the next shot it's cruise that is now inexplicably on top of the villain and then grabs the knife.<br/><br/>What B.S.

But I do enjoy the movies, even the non-Oscar-winning variety that seem so popular between Memorial Day and the Fourth of July. I even like special effects, when they serve a purpose besides, ""Look how much money we spent on this movie,"" or ""See? That really is Tom Cruise hanging from that cliff.""<br/><br/>You probably know the plot.  MI agent Ethan Hunt (Cruise) must recruit a sexy thief (Thandie Newton) to spy on good-guy-gone-bad Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) who wants rights to a deadly bacteria and its antidote. Ho-hum.  But as in most summer action adventures, the plot is peripheral to what really draws in that 15-25 male ticket-buyer, the special effects.<br/><br/>However, what is left to destroy, now that we've seen every building, public monument, and yes, planet, blown to smithereens?  What does MI-2 offer that no one else has given us?<br/><br/>We've done the pulling-the-face-off-to-reveal-another-person bit to death. We've had slo-mo karate out the wazoo. We've seen about a million explosions with the hero subsequently walking through the flames. And car chases? C'mon, now.  It's so '70s!<br/><br/>Take those out, and what does MI-2 have left?<br/><br/>Long, smoldering, soap-opera-ish looks between Cruise and Newton. (I kept waiting for the commercial break after each of these -- ""We'll return to Spies of Our Lives in just a moment."")<br/><br/>ECU's (extreme close-ups) of Scott trying to overcome the leftover Prince Charming aura to look evil.<br/><br/>And, oh yes, the lamest excuse for a final chase scene that I've seen in years -- Cruise and Scott darting at each other on motorcycles, all the while doing their best to stare menacingly at each other. Ooooh, nothing scarier than the annoying buzz of a couple of rice burners kicking up dust in the Australian outback, especially with those sinister kangaroos hopping about in the background.<br/><br/>Finally, why is it that, despite all the flashy technology at the disposal of the MI squad, the finale comes down to two guys rolling around in the dirt and punching each other in slow motion (never, of course, getting bruised or swollen, just garnering the occasional and slightly sexy bit of blood on one cheek or over one brow)?<br/><br/>My biggest complaint, however, has nothing to do with John Woo's approach to the action/adventure genre; it is that he has changed the original concept of the television show. For those of you who were born after the series (a depressingly high percentage of you), what was coolest about it was that it was, well, cool, in the Marshal McLuhan sense of the word, meaning not hot, but detached and unemotional.<br/><br/>At the end of each episode, the MI team would calmly walk away from the scenes of destruction and chaos, and the bad guys would never be the wiser. They had no idea they'd been tricked, as their demise had been brought on by their own stupidity. The team was never recognized or discovered. Nothing was ever personal.<br/><br/>That they did so to the perfect timing of the best TV score ever written was icing on the cake.<br/><br/>Woo, however, uses his theme early, making the last 15 minutes truly anti-climatic. The heated battle for personal vengeance between Cruise and Scott is embarrassing and unprofessional, rather like two school boys fighting over the prom queen. Definitely not cool.<br/><br/>Explosions, slow-motion karate, and plastic face-pulling do not make up for the lack of intellectual involvement in this bloated summer blockbummer.<br/><br/>I'd save this one for video."

But M:I2 had more stunts, more likeable characters, more gunplay (Thanks, Mr. Woo!), a much more taunt direction, and a viewer-friendly plot. Therefore, its storyline wasn't too complicated enough to give the movie-goer a headache! Tom Cruise is back as Ethan Hunt, secret agent extrodinaire back to stop evil forces at work, with the help of his old buddy Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), an Aussie chopper pilot, and a hot thief named Nya (Thandie Nordoff-Hall). Their mission, which they did choose to accept, was to retrieve a killer virus stolen by a former IMF agent named Ambrose (a dastardly Dougray Scott), whose plan was to infect the whole city of Sydney, Australia with the virus. Of course, not being an easy task, Ethan and gang risk life and limb to stop the madman and his buddies.<br/><br/>A guarenteed heart-stopper, ""M:I2"" pushes all the buttons for the perfect action thriller. I can't believe some of the other IMDB users are giving bad vibes against this flick!! What's wrong with you people?! Maybe what you need is an IMF lesson in good taste."

","Immediately after exiting the theater I felt dumb as I needed help to find my car, and how to start it and how to turn it on, as this movie made me stupider, and afterwards, I had to go home and watch the discovery channel for cleansing.<br/><br/>It was horrible from the get-go. Tom Cruise hanging on a cliff for no reason, and then the cheesy FX of sunglasses exploding. Good intro to awful film making.  Then, there was a rushed romance where I couldn't understand how Cruise and Newton could fall for one another.  Cruise's character is suppose to be a bad ass spy, and they both acted like they popped the other's cherry.  Then there's the bad guy which seems jaded like his ballet class has worked him too hard, because he is not a frightening man.  Maybe the worst bad guy ever.  He had two key scenes.  One, he gave his buddy a faulty manicure; and two, he cries... and who cares, we know this film sucked.<br/><br/>Bottom line: at the drive-in this summer I expect to see a double feature of M:I2 and Showgirls.

This movie's special f/x were impressive the first time around but lost something in the second, third and fourth viewings you see it.

Some more reasons I hated it are: the absolute lack of intended comic relief {you can groan at the absolute lack of reality in the action scenes, though}; and the fact that it was so damn loud! {That could be blamed on the cinema I saw it at, though.}I got two things out of this movie: 1, hours of exclaiming over all the flaws and wishing I could get my money back, 2, when you feel like walking out, walk out!"

I cringe every time I hear them, and I've been living in Australia all my life!<br/><br/>The stunts were great, there were loads of explosions and Ford Falcons being destroyed (much to my satisfaction) and lots of shootouts, but the dialogue was non-existent, the acting was not much better, and the leading lady managed to de-robe herself to the wheezing of various diva tunes on more than one occasion.

"Sabriane","1","0","1","2 June 2000"," Mission: Impossible to sit through.
","It seems that the writing team behind M:I2 said to each other: ""Ok, the last movie turned out to be too convoluted and messy for the average movie goer to comprehend. So this time around, let's make the plot as simple, cheesy and predictable as possible, and stuff it full with the tired cliches and those cool mask-ripping tricks that the viewer can anticipate ten minutes beforehand. Let's make the dialogue as dumb and laughable as possible, with pearlers like ""Damn, you're beautiful"" or ""I'm not gonna lose you!"". Let's include a few pretty shots of Sydney's Opera House, but never make any real use of the location. Let's cut most of John Woo's violent poetry to a minimum; after all, a PG-13 rating means more success at the box-office! And to make the film seem like a thinking man's action movie, let's pretend to do some ""character development"" in the first half by including a romance that shall grind the whole movie to a halt.""<br/><br/>And here we have it, ladies and gentlemen: another soulless summer turkey that most people dislike and some passionately hate (judging by the responses I read on the net), but which nevertheless will make more than $200 million in America and another $200 million overseas.<br/><br/>What a waste of talent, this movie. Thandie Newton is an amazingly beautiful woman, but there is no chemistry whatsoever between her and Cruise; their relationship, which is supposed to be the heart and soul of the film, is never convincing or passionate. Her character starts out interestingly enough, as a smart, sexy professional who could be Hunt's equal, sort of like Michel Yeoh to Pierce Brosnan in ""Tomorrow Never Dies"". Then she quickly dissolves into the thankless role of a girlfriend, whose main purpose is to act as a helpless hostage and be saved by the hero. Her facial expressions seem to alternate between two main modes: staring longingly with a seductive smile on her lips, or looking worried and vulnerable.<br/><br/>Dougray Scott is an AWFUL villain. His accent is so painfully ridiculous, he overacts so badly that I couldn't help giggling from time to time. The worst thing, though, is that his character is sooo terminally dull. We learn absolutely nothing about his past or the motives for betraying his former employers. His scenes with Cruise lack tension and intensity, the kind of ""we-hate-each-others-guts"" feel that underlines the best villain-hero relationships. Hunt and Ambrose do suit each other in a way that both of those characters have zero personality and believability. Which brings us to Tom Cruise and his hero. Ethan Hunt has to be the blandest, dullest James Bond rip-off. He has no visible personality traits or quirks, no particular reasons to like or admire him, he's a nobody, really. He looks good and grins a lot, but that's about it. And as much as I like Tom Cruise and admire him as an actor, I could never buy him as a John Woo action hero. He's way too short, for one thing, and all his attempts to act all macho and intense brought giggles from me and others in the cinema.<br/><br/>Let's see, who else? Ving Rhames is totally wasted, spending most of his time looking worriedly at the computer screen and cracking unfunny jokes. Anthony Hopkins brings his usual charisma and dignity to the role of Hunt's superior, but his classy appearance is too brief to save the film.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I know that most of the action movies are not about good acting, characters, dialogue or plot. They can be as over-the-top improbable as they damn like, I'm not one of those nitpickers who roll their eyes during some crazy action scene and say ""yeah, right"". But when a supposedly action movie lacks any tension whatsoever, all the weak elements come to surface more clearly. I can ignore shallow characters, dumb dialogue and simplistic plot, but I can never forgive dullness and the lack of genuine excitement. And M:I2 was DULL with capital D.<br/><br/>Apart from the motorcycle chase which was pretty neat, there was no action scene that didn't remind me of another similar action scene in a much better movie. It even rips the original M:I's most famous scene, with Cruise being suspended on a cord. I suppose it was intended as a wink-wink reference, but it comes off as trite and recycled instead. There's way too much slow motion, and what's the deal with those constant close-ups on the face?<br/><br/>I went to this movie with no expectations other than having a blast of a time without putting any pressure on the brain. Instead, it disappointed me on every single level I could think of. I give it 1 out of 10."

I was still waiting to see something - anything - I hadn't already seen.  Every single action shot - every motorcycle trick, every explosion, every slow-motion kick, was in the trailer. The problem for the promotion department is that there is nothing else in this movie. It is a void. The story is extremely derivative - every Hollywood cliche dumped into a sausage press and lethargically cranked out. To say that the characters are cardboard would be an exaggeration - cardboard is at least a quarter inch deep. No motivations, no interaction, no good dialog - I think there were two lines that was supposed to be funny. I wasn't expecting Shakespeare but I expected a lot more from John Woo. The were only two - TWO!?! - un exciting,  un original, and very short action sequences separated by interminable exposition. (As opposed to John Woo's Hardboiled of which the final third was one long, wild and amazing shootout that takes place in a hospital full of patients and new born babies. Now that's original!)

Congratulations! From a highly-strategic and tactical Television Series, to a highly self-motivated and one-man-secret mission, this last movie eventually changed into a full actions movie. Just that. There might be some contents exchange here. You can see the more and less lists below: Compared with the first one, you get: More emotional and love scenes More detailed actions and physical fights Tom Cruise exposed! Both body, face, and charismatic style, including awesome acrobatic style and Kung Fu moves (lets make a duel against Keanu Reeves) More sophisticated gadgets More face-offs And less: Less intelligent plots and smart strategies One man mission. This time he shares A BIT with his colleagues Less Mission: Impossible mysteries. This movie is predictable and simple And still: Focused on Ethan Hunt's personal judgements and revenge Left the other IMF agents backed him up with full supports (regardless his emotional interference) In the end, you find yourself looking at an action movie (much better than the last James Bond movie), entitled Mission: Impossible. Wrapped in world-class intelligent, but filled only with first-class actions. The biggest lost might be from the musical score. There's too many new standard applied here, including the opening scene. And the original-heart stamping mission theme song is cut off, and changed into a new rocking theme. For many Tom Cruise or action movies fans, this movie proves to be satisfying. But if you are an original Mission: Impossible fans, you will be disappointed.

Unfortunately this move ignores all of that and makes the movie one long over the top action sequence.  The plot (what there is of it) is contrived. The dialogue is extremely minimal, with a lot of holes.  With no plot to hold the movie together, one must rely on the action to get through this, but it is too much.  If you were to eliminate all the slow-motion effects, the movie would be reduced to half its running time.  Save your money"

","I was utterly disappointed by this movie.  My expectations were high as the first installment was reasonably well done.  This poor excuse for a sequel fell short in almost every category.  The plot was weak, and the ""mission"" seemed far from impossible. Most of the intrigue and suspense you would expect as a fan of the TV show or even the first movie were taken out in favour of sequence after sequence of Tom Cruise performing WWF-style acrobatics in slow motion.  The supporting characters were pushed so far into the background as to make them inconsequential, instead, more Cruise back-flips and more things blowing up.  If it's ""Mission Impossible"" you are after, stay home.  This was more like a Van Damme show-off piece than an ode to a once-great premise."

The plot is boring and hackneyed and no one thought to give the villain any motivation at all.

Also, it dragged slowly at times. However, you won't see that in ""Mission: Impossible II"", which is a vast improvement over part 1. Thank goodness. Just about everything in ""MI2"" is better than in ""MI1"". The action. The special effects. The locations. Tom Cruise is also much better here than he was in the first film.

","Possibly the worst movie I've seen in a decade... I usually can sense dreck like this before I'm tricked into paying for a ticket, but the rock-climbing preview seemed to promise a cool summer film. It wasn't...the movie consisted of bad acting, inane dialogue, stupid plot, horrid music, annoyingly repetitive explosions and gunfire, actors who aren't half as sexy as they think they are, endless staged-looking car crashes, too many aerial shots of Sydney, and dumb rubber masks being pulled off half the casts' faces.

Tom Cruise, who is one of the producers, should have demanded to have Brian De Palma back, who actually knows a thing or two about story telling.<br/><br/>The only other movie that is even close to the quality of this picture is Battlefield Earth, and I even liked that movie more because at least you could laugh at how pathetic John Travolta looks."

John Woo has turned what should have been a taut physcological thriller into an unwatchable collection of exagerrated, and therefore stupid, action sequences.

","This movie was a total disappointment for me. In the first 15-20 minutes it was not so badly done, but after that the story simply lost all dramatic suspense and conviction in a miserably failed attempt to turn an action film into some sort of ""artistic"" dance with overly-emphasized use of slow motion sequences. I have never in my life watched an action film with so many karate chops and gunshots and explosions, and so little suspense, so little thrill. Some of the characters, especially the key villain, were unconvincing and sort of not fully formed (the writers could take a few cues from the Bond movies), and director Woo seemed to think so highly of some of his ""inventions"" that he felt the need to repeat them over and over again (more than he should have to achieve the desired effect, e.g. the waves during the fight sequence at the end). The music was overdone and badly placed at times, too. By the end, the story (along with the suspense and drama) seemed to have lost all importance - it was like watching a really long music video with scenes from an action flick in it."

","Marketing is like magic.  It really is.  This film was marketed to look like it was action packed from beginning to end.  Kudos to the marketing guys for doing so.  They have to be considered similar to a David Copperfield. Copperfield can give you the illusion that something is there or something isn't.  The trailers for this film do the same.  We are led to believe that MI2 is going to be your typical summer action flick with explosions, car chases, mano-a-mano fight sequences and anything else that will increase your pulse.<br/><br/>They lied.<br/><br/>The trailer also promises you that John Woo is here to replace a stagnant Brian De Palma in the director's chair.  It also screams to us that it is not going to be like the first one.  It is going to be better.<br/><br/>HAH!  What a load of crap!<br/><br/>First let's talk about John Woo.  This man has a visual style that is matched by no one.  His propensity to direct a good action film is not challenged in today's Hollywood.  But this is also a man that is in love with the slow motion button on his camera.  We usually see slow motion in everything from people eating a sandwich to reading Shakespeare to yawning as the sun passes overhead.  It is overkill and although I can admit that he is a great artist with a broad stroke in action sequences I also have to say he does not know how to create tension in other areas of his work not involving action.  It also has to be said that I think he is in love with Thandie Newton.  Okay, sure she is beautiful.  But I do not need a close up of her in every shot.  After a while it gets incredibly cumbersome and it tries to dehort you from the inequities of the rest of the film by having her face take up the entire 60 foot screen.  I can understand doing it at first, but come on, 20, 30 times in the film?  It becomes cataclysmic and tiresome.<br/><br/>The first film was verbose and silly in some ways, but this one is void of any real action until the final thirty minutes and the director and his camera are in love with the female star.  If Woo likees her that much why not just show her naked once, get it out of the way and then move on.  How many shots, how much film was wasted trying to get her in the perfect light with just the right amount of hair hanging in her face and so on and so on? Too many.<br/><br/>But back to the crux of my complaint.  There was very little action here and that is funny.  The final 30 minutes of the film is some of the best action probably ever filmed.  The motorcycle chase was breath taking, the fight scene was tense and exhilirating and the break in by Cruise into the fortress where Sean is negotiating his deal left me awestruck.  That is where Woo excelled in the film.  But what of the first 90 minutes?<br/><br/>MI2 has a great climax to the film but that is all it has going for it.  I am actually giving it a 6 out of 10 because of it's style and energy at the end.  But frankly I was bored with the rest of the movie.  If as much energy was put into the entirety of the film as went into the end, and into showing how beautiful the female lead was, then this would have been a great film, as it stands, it is a mediocre one.<br/><br/>Prediction:  MI3 in 2004"

"afuller","1","0","1","25 May 2000"," So terrible it's hilarious....
","SPOILERS FOLLOW! I like escapism as much as the next guy, but not when it's this mindless and melodramatic. I really don't know where to begin with this film other than mentioning that I should've believed the early reviews I'd seen and waited for word of mouth from my friends rather than rushing right out to see this film opening night. I should also note that I was in a packed 300 seat theater, and the majority of the filmgoers there were in stitches for one reason or another. All of the laughter that was generated was probably unintentional on the part of the filmmakers. I suppose I will start with the plot which we found to be utterly linear and predictable. Anyone looking for a convoluted yarn in the vein of the first movie will be sorely disappointed. It is also full of huge holes, like the fact that Luther claimed to hack into NATO GHOSTCOM in the first film. In this one, he can't even disable a simple alarm in a commercial corporation's security system. Maybe his skills got rusty because he partied too much between films. Since the good guys locate the bad guys in the first half hour, it becomes glaringly obvious that they could be wiped out by SAS, SEALs, Delta Force, etc. about halfway through the film. The crowd at my theater repeatedly burst into laughter at dialogue which was entirely inappropriate for the situation depicted onscreen. None of the characters were very memorable or engaging, except Ving Rhames' part. Dougray Scott was more an annoying wuss than anything else. Maybe he'll be better as Logan in X-Men. Thandie Newton looked cute, but that's about all she contributed. Woo's direction of this film is really tedious. There is an utter lack of tension except for the closing minutes, and even during that part some goofy cuts are made. Most annoying are the repeated slow pans and zooms that are supposed to show us the characters are so cool and dangerous it hurts. This is tough to buy when they're ambling along the street or a dock. Woo's dove fetish also got a lot of laughs during the closing minutes of the film. Tom Cruise also landed many chuckles with his martial arts talents. Yes he looked fairly credible, but an agent in such situations would be more concerned with killing efficiently rather than gracefully. Also note that the chase scenes in the movies are real snoozers, nowhere in the league of say, ""Bullitt"". I still can't get over the tedium of the final chase scene. In real life, the Triumph bikes used in the film would walk away from the SUVs and sedans in pursuit. My final beef is with the score. Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard also scored ""Gladiator"", and he was prevented from attending the premiere of that film because he had to work on this film's score. I can tell you right now, one of them was absolutely smashing and functioned brilliantly and it certainly wasn't this one. Zimmer is all over the place here seems to reference all the boring parts of his past works. Lisa Gerrard's stylings added a nice sense of humanity and gravitas to Gladiator but here they combine with the overly melodramatic visuals to descend into the realm of pure cheese. Unless you're really eager to waste $8 and 123 minutes of your life, I'd advise waiting to see this hits your local Blockbuster..."

From there, we catch up with Ethan Hunt, dangling off of a cliff.  He gets his orders and we're off on a thrill ride that only John Woo can deliver.  The first part of the movie gives us espionage, treachery, suspense and a taste of what's to come in the second half.  Woo gives us his trademark action sequences where laws of physics take a back seat to his dazzling displays of bullets and bodies flying through space, and there are many scenes of this caliber that are just too visual to describe.  There are enough explosions, car crashes and fights to satisfy any fan of a good action film.  Your mission, seek out M:I-2 and see Woo and Cruise work their magic."

Cruise fans should love this movie because he is basically in almost every scene and always smiling. In the first film he acted, this one he basically just flashes his smile, what's up with that. The script is nonexistent and how many times do we really need a face-change sequence. John Woo has recently had a bad streak since he came to hollywood and this is his worst film. Cruise doesn't even assemble a team when he captures Thandy Newton, he basically does it himself. Ving Rhames who was good in the first film feels like his role is basically a cameo. This film has lost its roots from the television show and instead wants to be like James Bond. Thandie Newton is basically eye-candy, she isn't even needed for her skills as a thief but instead for her skills at seducing. Dougray Scott is a bad villian. What the h**l happened to the brilliant score of Danny Elfman, instead the score is rocked-up. The only saving grace of this movie is the motorcycle sequences. The fight scenes between Scott and Cruise is lethargic at best and seems like a fight out of WWF smackdown. Who cares about Chymera and Belereform. Hopefully Fincher can save the series.<br/><br/>Premise: Hunt must stop a deadly virus.<br/><br/>Mission: Impossible 2 was not nominated for an Academy award but it won MTV awards and was nominated for Razzies.<br/><br/>Grade: 4/10 (Horrible)."

One of the major ones -spoiler here- is the whole mask thing in the end.  Sure, I'd under stand Hunt bringing a mask of the villain, but why in the world would he bring a mask-of himself?

","Ugh, this movie was absolutely reprehensible! This movie is basically nothing more than a demo of action and stunt scenes. The plot is ridiculous, and Tom Cruise's acting is enough to make you want to hurl yourself from a speeding motorcycle over a cliff, shooting pistols in both hands, while explosions are going off all around you and doves fly around in slow motion.<br/><br/>
If you like looking at Tom Cruise's handsome face and body, then this movie is for you.  You get to see Tom Cruise run around, do flips, shoot guns, climb mountains, ride motorcycles, take out whole armies of bad guys, and most importantly: ***smile and look handsome***.   I mean, even the people who wrote the movie acknowledge this fact!! Here is a line that the villain spoke in the movie:<br/><br/>Sean Ambrose: ""You know, the hardest part about playing you is grinning like an idiot every fifteen bloody minutes.""<br/><br/>Exactly! The writers think its idiotic too!<br/><br/>And don't get me started on this whole putting on a mask that lets you look exactly like someone else bit(which the above line is referring to).  First of all, its impossible. Second of all, it is a HORRIBLE COP-OUT.  You actually lose the TRUST of the audience in the plot.  All of sudden, ANYBODY could be a wearing a mask and a voicechip, so you are uncertain of who's who and whats what! Any minute, you are expecting the henchman to rip off his mask to reveal he's Tom Cruise, and Tom Cruise to rip off his mask to reveal that he's Thandie Newton and Thandie Newton to rip off her mask to reveal she's TV's Jay Leno.  HORRIBLE.  <br/><br/>I feel bad for John Woo.  I have a feeling that Woo had very little control whatsoever in the direction of this film and was probably pushed around by Tom Cruise and the producers to make it in THEIR vision.  What Woo needs to do is go back to his roots and film a movie in Hong Kong or China where he has ultimate control like Ang Lee did with Crouching Tiger.   This is definitely nowhere near his previous efforts in HK, nor even Broken Arrow. Watch ""Hard Boiled"", ""Killer"" or ""Bullet in the Head"" and witness the true abilities of John Woo.  M:I-2 shouldn't be counted."

","A lethal virus called 'chimera' could potentially fall into the wrong hands, so Ethan Hunt must accomplish another Mission:Impossible to prevent this. But this time he's against his toughest enemy - an evil alter-ego who... Oh, who gives a damn!  It's already become predictably cliched and I haven't even mentioned the love triangle OR that Hunt is acting to avenge the murder of a mentor OR the repeated face changes which were disarming in Face Off and are anally convenient here...<br/><br/>Look, there's no doubting Woo's credentials (and he was the only reason I rented this movie!) and the action sequences are impecably executed and frequently exciting.  Unfortunately however, they go on for far too long - just like the movie as a whole.  A prime example of this is the big fight at the end.  Now it may feature some stunning choreography but there really is such a dictum as 'too much of a good thing' and by the end (in fact, considerably before that) you really don't care who wins as long as somebody does and quickly.  And I won't even mention the farcical nature of the hero being hit flush in the face with a jagged rock and not bleeding as a result! Oops - I just did...<br/><br/>For those M:I2 fans who would choose to delve into the defence that I 'don't understand Woo or his ballet of violence' - get real!  Woo's Hong Kong films were neither as pretentious as this and nowhere near the length.  They were taut, economical expressions of a specific cinematic discipline (choreographed screen violence/action) and they advanced that discipline appreciably.  The key word here though is economic.  When the money was tight in the old days - a little action had to say a hell of a lot: And it spoke volumes.  In M:I2 however the reverse philosophy applies and consequently the action scenes say far too much - very little of which is worth listening to.<br/><br/>Finally - the narrative and dialogue of this film are frequently trite and superficial: And by that I mean the love story!  As unbelievable as 'Face Off' was, it was clear from the outset that it was all Woo's movie (Cruise's influence here is unfortunately heavy handed) and in Cage, Travolta and Allen he had performers of a far greater calibre than he has here; and consequently they could manipulate even the most ludicrous dialogue or plot developments and make them slightly more palatable: something beyond the key players here.  Which is particularly unfortunate considering Dougray Scott's potential gravitas wasted in a cliche riddled, one dimensional monster.  I mean, even Jean Claude van Damme doesn't pretend he's in Hamlet!<br/><br/>In short: There's little here you haven't seen before and most of the stuff that's new frequently teeters on the edge of irritation.  Woo is NOT Ang Lee and he should steer well clear of romantic drama.  Even if he's being bankrolled by an over-reaching star who's clearly unaware of the law of diminishing returns.  And I mean art - not bank balance!  Because sometimes I like to think that that's the point!"

You shouldn't use your brain while watching this idiotic fare.<br/><br/>Now it may be that MI:II was an action pastiche. Certainly you must wonder how Cruise could deliver some incredibly hammy lines - how he'll find the love of his life (whom he knew for about five minutes), how he'll stop the bad guys, etc. - without cracking up at the absurdity of it all. The plot too is laughable - it's Mr. Killer Virus and his friend The Antidote! Oh my can we guess who's going to be infected with the virus and force Cruise to get the last bit of antidote? Original and clever, it ain't. People complained the first one was too difficult to follow? Don't worry, you'll have no problems here...Oh and as a plot device the ""face mask"" must win some award for being the most over-used plot tool ever.<br/><br/>So there's no acting or script to speak of. What's left is - of course - the action scenes. This is where the real humour (it must be) kicks in. Ethan (Cruise's character) demonstrates degrees of athleticism that would merit a place in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" as he back-flips and cavorts his body all over the place, knocking down the baddies aplenty. His skill is not limited to martial arts as he engages in gunfights using the ""infinite ammo"" cheat to dance (in slow motion of course - this is John Woo directing) around knocking off small armies of henchmen without being grazed himself (couldn't muss up that hair could we?). And I thought it was bad enough - but get a load of that final car/bike chase. It gave me a good laugh if nothing else.<br/><br/>Once the laughter died, I decided I hadn't seen a very good movie.

Part of it a plan to become a very wealthy individual in cooperation with a treacherous pharmaceutical executive.

There's nothing funnier than seeing the leading action hero shout ""I'm not losing you!"" to the damsel in distress, something we've seen in dozens of films in the past decade. John Woo, quite literally the best action film director today, adds a few deft touches to a film, that is just bad. It seems like all critics want to do is kiss a superstar like Cruise, right on the keyster because he's such a big star. ""Don't take it seriously."" they proclaim, as they do a direct hypocrisy of this statement with virtually any other summer film, because it may not have a big star. If you want a good action film, I suggest Woo's earlier efforts ""Hard Boiled"", ""The Killer"", and ""A Better Tomorrow II"". His poetry of violence is sprawled throughout these poetic films that are brilliant on their own level. ""MI:2"" is completely different from the DePalma film, in thought and action sequence. <br/><br/>Grade: D+"

","Many Hollywood ""sequels"" are merely inferior remakes, this being no exception, as our hero Cruise is introduced to many dangerous and death-defying situations, all of which he of course escapes unscathed.  The first film was good (at best!), the most distracting part being the frequent ""I'm not who you think I am because I'm wearing a mask so that I look like someone else"" trick, which unfortunately resurfaced in M:I-2.  This time we're ready for it, and it becomes less of a ""aha, they got me there"" trick, and more of a ""christ, will they give it a rest already?"" annoyance. Honestly, it's a copout gimmick that should have died with the original series.  M:I-2 is simply another 007 film under an assumed name, with a few minor differences: ""Bond"" (aka Cruise) actually falls in ""love"" with the female lead, and of course that whole pull-the-face-off thing. Interestingly it was voted a major bomb by audiences (who of course went to see it anyway because of its hype and because of the Cruise-Kidman connection) in Australia - the same audiences which love the Bond films!! ""Bond by any other name is not as sweet?""  I was surprised at the average user rating of M:I-2... 6.0/10 is far higher than it deserves, and I'm interested to find out why so many people seemed to like it so much.  We've seen it all before, ""it"" being a cross between MISSION IMPOSSIBLE (1996), any recent 007 film (say, TOMORROW NEVER DIES) and those dodgy martial arts films which try to back spectacular, anti-realistic fight sequences with intelligible plot.  And it goes on and on and ON and ON!!!  How long can a dumb action ""thriller"" get?  I suppose they did pad it with frequent, unnecessary slow-motion replays and a ridiculous, operatic score...there's no doubt in my mind that this is one of those films which benefits from IMDb's system of audience ratings, in that people get home from seeing a wham-bam effects-driven film on the big screen with their friends, immediately think ""gee that wasn't actually too bad"" and log in a vote of 7. In another five years this film will hardly be remembered: ""Didn't they make a movie version of the old MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE series?""  ""Yeah, it was pretty dodgy. Didn't it star Tom Cruise or someone?""  ""I think so.  Actually wasn't there a sequel?""  ""LOL. There must have been. It is Hollywood after all...""  Rating: 5/10."

In this w*** of a movie Tom Cruise says almost the exact same thing to his lady friend before he jumps out a window. That's about the time I felt like walking out. I wish I did because it only got worse. And bugger me mate, hearing Australian actors mate putting on the stereotypical ""Aussie"" accent mate was almost too much to take mate. For people in the States who think we all speak like that, WE DON'T!! And in case you were wondering, I don't know a single person who drinks Fosters either."
"chrisbrown6453","8","0","1","25 October 2001"," Mission: Impossible 2, directed by John Woo (Face/Off) explores the action genre by exploiting the stylization of violence.
","Characterized by a hyper realistic aesthetic, Mission: Impossible 2 displays carefully choreographed chase scenes and sophisticated acrobatics Ã -la-Matrix (often shot in slow-motion ((ugh!)), although not by freezing and rotating the image), between villain and hero.<br/><br/>In Mission: Impossible 2 (or M:I2), the lead spy is Ethan Hunt played once again by Tom Cruise, thank god they didn't do the whole James Bond thing by having someone new play him, and his team includes the beautiful thief Nyah (Thandie Newton) and the computer systems expert Luther (Ving Rhames). The mission involves capturing ""Chimera"", a deadly virus engineered by a Russian scientist in search for the cure for influenza. However, in transit to the U.S., the priceless Chimera falls into the wrong hands and Ethan and his team must stop the villainous Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) from exploiting the dangerous chemical weapon. In spite of the film's introductory sequence (where the chosen spy listens to the recognizable recording of the mission's description that ""will self-destruct in 5 seconds""), Woo's Mission: Impossible 2 distances itself significantly from the trademark characteristics which made the television show quite unique. Rather, M:I2 seems to be defined by the director's fascination with the notion of the interchangeability of the face/mask/identity, as more successfully explored in his earlier film Face/Off.  In M:I2, Tom Cruise's character is portrayed as superhuman, and his ways of resolving conflict and surviving death-threatening situations depend more on his superhuman physical strength and ability than on genius or wit. This choice reflects an emphasis on the mechanics of action (enhanced by stunt work and special effects) over the intellectual and emotional conflict and suspense that ensue from good, dramatic writing.<br/><br/>All in all, Mission: Impossible 2 suffers from the imbalance produced by excessive action and little drama, and by the predictability of a plot that exists merely to exhibit the magnificence of its hero.  Not even close to the spectacularness ( I know, that's not a word!) of the  1995 original."
"basrutten","3","0","1","12 October 2001"," John Woo's genius is destroyed by Tom Cruise's ego
","Contrary to the first Mission Impossible movie, this time there is a plot that can actually be understood and the pacing is much better then in the first M:I<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this is where the good points stop. The story suffers severely from ridiculous plot-twists (all those scenes in which somebody removes one of those masks are totally unbelievable), the action scenes are sometimes flashy but they are usually so over-the-top that is becomes utterly nonsensical (I mean, is it possible to ride a motor bike at over 100 mph and then making a car explode by hitting it only once in the fuel tank, while aiming by only looking in the rear view mirror of the motor cycle ?). Another fine example is the scene where Tom Cruise jumps over a 100 metre cliff for no apparent reason, reaches the top of the mountain and is shot at by helicopter with a missile that contains his orders in the form of an exploding pair of sunglasses. Why ?<br/><br/>The movie is full of this kind of exaggerated action scenes, which are obviously only meant to show how 'cool' Tom Cruise is: he shoots like the Terminator, fights like Bruce Lee, drives like Michael Schumacher, gets women like James Bond etc. He is so invincible that it takes all the suspense out of the movie.<br/><br/>It's really a shame that a great director like John Woo has wasted his talents on showing off Mr. Cruises ego, because there are some points in the movie where Woo's genius actually showes up, but they are few and far between. Too bad"

","Hey Tom Cruise, if you're listening, pay attention: There's a big difference between making money and creating a legacy. This stuff may rake in the bucks, but it sucks. I'm no art film junky. I appreciate a good, mindless action film every summer. But I want one that doesn't completely copy its predecessor. How about a movie without you dangling from a rope? Or playing Kick-Boxer Guy? How about taking some of those dollars and investing in an original idea? You used to be something. Now you're just another schmuck a mid-life crisis away from oblivion. If Harrison Ford can become irrelevant, you're certainly expendable."
"Rimmer-10","7","0","1","8 August 2001"," Good ole nonstop action
","Well - you can't really expect this movie to be anything else but a gadget filled action adventure. And it is - and I found that it did a great job with a few flaws along the way.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise has worked out - no question - but I somehow find it a bit hard to appreciate his Bruce Lee wannabe tendencies. Some of the villains that gets manhandled by Cruise are very, very slow. Their reactions (or lack of) to a sidekick/whatever from Cruise adds new meaning to the term ""a sitting duck"".<br/><br/>All in all though - I liked the movie - I was entertained. However I would like John Woo (and/or the writers) to think about the following, if they would like to make MI:3.<br/><br/><ul><li>Why are villains bad shots? A villain with a machine gun was not able to hit Cruise with 100+ shots, but Cruise was able to hit the villain flying through the air, head down/feets up with ONE single shot.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Why does villains have to talk when they have the hero on target? Why not just shoot the SOB instead of trying to talk him to death? The hero does not seem to have those tendencies when wacking the bad guys.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Why does the ""number 1 villain left for dead"" have to wake up for the final scare?</li></ul><br/><br/>The above is so-so cliched I cannot believe that they are still used - and I would really appreciate a Hollywood action movie without them - they don't add anything to a movie - except annoyance.<br/><br/>Rating: 7 of 10 - a good score - most of all because of the gadgets and Thandie Newton (woooohaaaaa)."

","1st watched 5/5/2001 - 6 out of 10(Dir-John Woo): Catchy action/adventure movie from action-director John Woo and big-money making star Tom Cruise.  It has been obvious with John Woo in his directing career that he can keep you going with the action that he directs, but when you can also have good acting and a script that keeps you interested he comes out looking much better.  This movie has enough twists and turns to keep you watching despite long-overdone ending(which is typical of these kinds of movies).  Cruise and Mission Impossible really make a good modern/cool James Bond type which I think can be explored in future movies."

"miketh","5","0","1","21 March 2001"," misconceived sequel
","The cool thing about Mission Impossible II is that it's a John Woo movie. The dumb thing about it is that it's *just another* John Woo movie. The first MI movie was great because of a complex plot, combined with great action scenes. This movie is nothing but action scenes. Change the setting and the actors, and half the scenes in this movie could be substituted with ones from Face/Off (and vice versa) and you'd never be able to tell the difference.<br/><br/>Fans of John Woo will find a lot to like here. It's got all his trademarks -- slow motion shots of people walking in the wind, fight scenes where everyone spins around a lot, and so forth. For that matter, fans of action movies in general will like it too. But if you like this movie, it's not *because* you liked the first one. If you watch it, watch it for brainless action. If you go in expecting a engaging or challenging plot, get ready to be as disappointed as I was."
"Howlin Wolf","8","0","1","7 March 2001"," If you saw the trailer, then you knew what you were gonna get..
","The trailer was filled with nicely choreographed action sequences, cool one liners and various beautiful people set to a rocking soundtrack. I have to ask, if that didn't look like it was gonna be your thing, then why see the movie? It patently looked nothing like the first film (which was also excellent) so people decrying it as 'just another action movie' have missed the point of the entire exercise, I feel.<br/><br/>I don't usually like John Woo's style, too symbolism-heavy and stylised for my tastes, but it works surprisingly well here, probably because the main part of the film is spent probing the characters. There are some great set-pieces, beautiful cinematography and a first-rate cast. Cruise does a complete character transformation from the first film and emerges as a creditable action hero. Thandie Newton is great as always, both as eye-candy and because she's a talented actress, and Dougray Scott is largely brilliant as the villain Ambrose. Makes me think he would have made a great Wolverine in X-Men (although Hugh Jackman IS absolutely perfect for that role) Anthony Hopkins even appears for a perfect cameo, an even better Jim Phelps than Jon Voight was in the first movie!<br/><br/>I think the fact that it's so markedly different from the first one makes it a more enjoyable experience to watch them together, since they're both different types of movie. I would agree that the plot here is perhaps a bit TOO simple after the mind scramble that was M:I, but at least it's interesting, regardless of whether it was filched from Hitchcock or not. If you're gonna pilfer from anybody, best that they be a recognised genius... !<br/><br/>Ultimately, M:I-2 is a summer 'event' movie that delivers in spades. If you come across the trailer and LIKE it, then the movie's even better; if it leaves you cold, then don't watch the movie!"

","I was seriously disappointed on this movie. I thought the first one was a really good one 8/10, but then i saw in the beginning of the film that John Woo was the directer so my expectations went down the drain.<br/><br/>It is like all other John Woo movies, thin story but a LOT of no meaningless, flashy, supernatural action.<br/><br/>***spoiler*** When Cruise was riding his bike and did a ""stoppie"", that is, break really hard so the bike goes up on the frontwheel and swung around and start shooting, all this while the bike was balancing on one wheel made me fast forward the rest.<br/><br/>I like Tom Cruise, most of his movies are really good and he chose them wisely but this one was pure for the buck. Rent this one if you like John Woo, but if you wanna have a good story and some action which means something, then dont rent it. 4/10"

","The film had good actors, a decent story, and beautiful locales, unfortunately John Woo's over-the-top style ruins the whole effort.

"mmunies","5","0","1","31 January 2001"," Not as good as the first one
","While this was not a painful movie to watch, it certainly disappointed. It also had some extremely annoying aspects such as trying to be stylish or artsy by slowing a scene way down for no apparent reason. The result was cheesy and cliched.<br/><br/>Actually, the whole movie could be described as cheesy and cliched.  Sure, there were lots of COOL explosions, Sydney looked gorgeous and Tom Cruise was Tom Cruise.  It could be called mildly entertaining but it missed in so many ways.  The dialogue was insipid, Thandie Newton carried this love struck cow look on her face throughout most of the film, there were a lot of unbelievable parts (how convenient that the bad guys happened to have a land cruiser on hand to chase Cruise with)and it wasn't nearly as clever as it tried to be.  <br/><br/>I hope they don't go for MI III in this vein.  Hopefully, it will be more creative next time."
"rks","2","0","1","28 January 2001"," My last John Woo movie
","I have been dumb enough to go to John Woo movies before -- Broken Arrow. But after this I will not be even tempted to try another.<br/><br/>Many people complained about the first MI, but I liked it.  Because of that, I tried again.  One of the things that I have grown to hate over the years is fights that go on forever with each combatant getting in many blows that would be lethal in real life, but only slow down the participants in the movie -- often with silly slow motion that breaks out.  This formula worked very well for Wile E. and Road Runner as well as Adam West and Burt Ward, but just don't make it in a film supposedly aimed at persons with double digit ages.  This movie is so full of these scenes that seem to go on for 15 minutes that there is little time left for a real movie.<br/><br/>The media often report on how much stars are paid to do a movie.  I would love to know how much is spent on the script before I go to a movie.  This movie could not have budgeted more than $100."

There was NO chemistry between our two romantic leads and some of those corny lines would have done quite well in a daytime soap opera. We all concluded it was the worst movie we had seen in awhile (but at least we got a laugh out of it).<br/><br/>Also that ridiculous mask swapping business, this was asking us to suspend disbelief a tad too much. ""Hey I need to imitate the bad guy, I'll just use the fully realistic latex masks I happen to be carrying of both the villain and myself""..geeeesh..The action scenes were good I must admit especially the bike scenes but sadly they could not save the movie.

"ekwillow","3","0","1","13 January 2001"," An overrated sequel
","This movie was extremely overrated from the praise it got.  I was really looking forward to this when I paid three bucks to rent it and now I wished I never rented it.  Most of the movie was boring,  except the last 40 minutes,  and like the original it was confusing.  Only the original was a little enjoyable with some of the action it had. 	This sequel was hyped to be an awesome action movie with non-stop action and I thought it would have a lot of action because John Woo was directing it.  But as usual the previews lie.  Even though the last 40 minutes were non stop action the rest of it was confusing and boring.  I know I shouldn't count the action for this movie being bad but maybe a little more action would've made it better since it was so boring. 	This is why I hate Tom Cruise because he's made so many overrated movies in his career (Jerry Maguire,  Risky Business,  Eyes Wide Shut, etc.)  And I don't even think hes that great of an actor because it seems like he plays the same character in every movie. 	If you wanna watch this movie for the ""non-stop"" action then you shouldn't waste your money on it.  But if you wanna watch it for the confusing story telling then this is your movie."
