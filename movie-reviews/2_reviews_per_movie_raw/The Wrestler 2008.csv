","The Wrestler is a drama centered around an aging professional wrestler past his prime. It's so much more than that. You don't have to be a fan of wrestling to enjoy this film. The wrestling part of it can be put aside as a back story. Randy ""The Ram"" could be in any other profession, doing any other thing and could be in the same situation. That's what's so great about it. He's just a lonely guy, whose life seems to have passed him by. A middle aged man who doesn't have much going for him. Sure, he's a wrestler, but he needs wrestling more than wrestling needs him. He needs it to feel important, to feel like a somebody. He really has nothing to show for himself, no wife, just a daughter he hasn't been there for his whole life. Missed opportunities. He's sad and alone and we really do feel for him.<br/><br/>A closer bond seems to be forming between him and his stripper friend, played by Marisa Tomei, who seems to be in a similar situation as he is. The middle aged stripper who seems to have a real connection with ""The Ram"" is shown in another misunderstood profession. We all may not be as different as we may think. Health problems compromise his wrestling career as he tries to deal with the real world and rebuild his relationship with his abandoned daughter. The scenes with Evan Rachel Wood (his daughter) are touching. Beautifully done. Rourke's character portrayal of the Ram is one of the best in a long time. He's not just acting, he transforms into the character on screen. It's amazing to watch. All the credit he's getting is truly deserved.<br/><br/>The film is Directed by Darren Aronofsky, who also directed Requiem for a Dream. He does a beautiful job showing the sport with realism. The film respects the wrestlers and their world, and expects the same from the audience. This film is done in a style that's so real, so honest, so amazing, in easily one of the best films of the year. All around great performances and great direction. Definitely worth checking out sometime."

","It's no coincidence that Mickey Rourke is responsible for the comeback performance of the year if not the decade. Rourke's life and tumultuous past parallel Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson's own life so eerily close it becomes clear that no one else could have ever played this role. Darren Aronofsky's fourth feature is not only his most intimate but also his most accomplished to date. Aronofsky offers his most simplistic film both visually and narratively and ends up creating a film that has more depth and layers to it than any of his previous films.<br/><br/>Everything about Randy's life is in a state of decay. He retains a body that is on the verge of collapse, he hasn't seen his only daughter in years, financially he is exhausted, and the only thing that brings him solace in life is the same thing that threatens to end it. The most effective aspect of Randy's character is that no matter what mistakes he might have made in the past his sense of regret is so strong and genuine that it is impossible not to forgive him. As beaten down and alone as Randy might be he never looses his fighting spirit or sense of hope, no matter how little it may be. Regardless what hardship Randy is confronted with he never retreats and is admirably courageous even if being courageous might not be the smartest settlement.<br/><br/>For the general public who tend to find professional wrestling laughable and are quick to judge as a form of entertainment rather than a sport will find a deadly adversary in Aronofsky. The Wrestler shows that while outcomes of matches may be fixed the physical tolls these men take on their body are often more extreme and long lasting than most other ""respectable"" sports. The fact that Randy gives so much of himself and is ridiculed from everywhere to the trailer park he lives in to the job he keeps while not in the ring, makes us even more empathetic to the struggle Randy goes through to try and make it back on top. Overall The Wrestler is a constantly engaging and compelling character study with some of the finest acting, writing, directing I have seen in recent years. Oh and I forgot, the last shot will leave you speechless."
"ccthemovieman-1","9","86","103","25 March 2009"," A Haunting Portrait Of Loneliness
","Wow, what a sordid but fascinating film. I can why Mickey Rourke won so many awards for his performance, too. The same goes for the film.<br/><br/>The film was shocking to me: For instance, it was a shock seeing Rourke -""Randy The Ram"" - with the long, flowing blond hair and rippling muscles. Hey, it's not that former boxer was ever in bad shape, but he never had muscles like this either. The man must have pumped a lot of iron to get ready for this role as an aging wrestler.<br/><br/>Another shock was seeing Maria Tomei, of ""My Cousin Vinny"" fame, naked - and in that state in more than one scene. She didn't leave much to the imagination as ""Cassidy."" A third shock was seeing some of the early wrestling scenes. Yeah, pro wrestling is rough stuff and it's bloody and it's fake, etc., but the scenes in here are pretty brutal, more than I've ever seen on TV. The one extended match with the ""staples"" was pretty gruesome.<br/><br/>Evan Rachel Wood is convincing as Randy's daughter ""Stephanie."" This 21-year-old is no stranger to acting, having been doing it since she was four! The scenes with her and her dad are memorable.<br/><br/>When the shock of the above scenes of sex and violence (and language) fade away, underneath it all is a very tender, sad tale of a lonely man who invested too much in his career and, after coming close to mortality, realizes the important of family and simply being loved by anyone. That's what sticks with you long after the film ends. Loneliness can be a killer.<br/><br/>""Randy"" tries to mend fences and post a few himself - in his final quest not to wind up as an island in this world of humanity - with both successful and unsuccessful results. Sometimes you can never change what you are, and sometimes you can. Both of those are demonstrated here in this oddly-edgy-but sentimental film."
"nonsequitur247","Null","355","450","10 December 2008"," Mickey Rourke is as great as everyone's saying he is.
","Nicholas Cage? Bruce Willis? Wrong. Never would have worked. No one else could have played Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson with the compassion and energy he brings to the role--it's painful to see the fading professional wrestler coming to terms with both his mortality and the emptiness of his life outside the ring, and this is largely due to Rourke's excellent acting. Twenty years after the defining match of his career, Randy is still a fan favorite and loving his work--until he suffers a heart attack. The film follows the gentle giant as he tries to adjust to living without wrestling, reconnect with his estranged daughter (Evan Rachel Wood), and kindle a bond with a friend who works in a strip club (Marisa Tomei).<br/><br/>This isn't just a film about professional wrestling, but Aronofsky gets that part right. He does a beautiful job showing the sport with realism without mocking it: he highlights the humor, but never makes fun of it. He doesn't just deconstruct the mythical image of wrestlers' performances, but he also destroys their apparent rage towards each other. It's clear that these guys are friends--they care about and respect each other. These other wrestlers in the film are all played by professionals, and they do a great job with the acting. The film respects them and their world, and demands the same from the audience.<br/><br/>The other supporting characters are strong as well. Tomei and Wood's characters could easily have fallen into clich√©s, but they give Randy some of his best moments on screen. Tomei's storyline, especially, serves as a nice parallel and contrast to Randy's. Wood's could use a little more juice, but her story arc does the same. Both are effective.<br/><br/>Another notable aspect of the film is its music. The character of Randy is a big '80s rock fan, and for the film, they got the rights to use Guns N' Roses' ""Sweet Child o' Mine."" A special thanks at the end of the film went out to Axl Rose. On the softer side, Bruce Springsteen wrote ""The Wrestler"" for the credits, and its sweet melancholy serves as the perfect coda for the film.<br/><br/>Overall, 'The Wrestler' is great. It's a rich, round film that smoothly weaves together pathos and comedy and soul. It's funny and dramatic, tear-jerking and tough. Definitely a must-see this winter."

","I caught an advanced screening of The Wrestler starring Mickey Rourke last night in Hollywood, CA. Following the screening was a Q&A session with Mickey Rourke, Darren Aronofsky, Marisa Tomei, Evan Rachel Wood, and film composer Clint Mansell.<br/><br/>Mickey Rourke delivers one of the most honest and heart breaking performances I've seen from an actor. Very rarely do you see an actor come back with such a role. He is truly extraordinary in The Wrestler. There are times in this film when I wonder just how much of this is Mickey in character as ""The Ram"" or Mickey reacting as Mickey to a situation similar to what he went through in his ""lost years"". The parallels are astounding. There is a scene when Randy ""The Ram"" is in the ring and he points to the audience ""It is not over until you tell me it's over"". Is it Mickey or Randy talking there? As a newly revived Mickey Rourke fan, I can tell you this audience member says it's just beginning Mickey!<br/><br/>Marissa Tomei delivers a stellar performance as an aging exotic dancer the parallel story to Mickey's character ""The Ram"". Evan Rachel Wood really brings it as ""The Rams"" angry, abandoned and emotionally exhausted daughter. The chemistry between Mickey and Evan is breath taking!<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky delivers this story to us with honesty, realism and artistic skill. I think this young director will be around making fantastic films for some time to come. At least I hope he is!<br/><br/>You can't go wrong with this film. It is rock solid to the core!<br/><br/>Facts from the Q&A<br/><br/>Only the 3rd American Film to with the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival.<br/><br/>The film was made for $7 Million.<br/><br/>The filmscore is more atmospheric as the composer did not want to interfere with the documentary feel of the film.<br/><br/>Mickey Rourke trained for 6 months to get to the wrestling weight of 235 for the film. Weight training, wrestling training and eating 5,000 calories.<br/><br/>The scenes of Mickey Rourke and Evan Rachel Wood were as real as they could get. The actors put on music before the scene and just talked about their real life and Mickey's parallels to the film. When the director felt they were there he would yell action and they would work through the scene. <br/><br/>The scenes back stage with the wrestlers were all real as well. The crew would go to wrestling matches and film the wrestlers before/after matches. Mickey would walk in and introduce himself (in character) and the scene was improvised. <br/><br/>The film was about 20-30% improvisation from the actors."
"grmagne","9","421","547","9 September 2008"," An excellent drama about an aging wrestler
","The Wrestler won the Golden Lion a few days ago in Venice. Obviously that's going to build up some high expectations but director Darren Aronofsky introduced it as a ""simple little film"" and he didn't want the movie to get over-hyped. He said it's been a busy week as he only finished the film 6 days ago!! <br/><br/>Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson, played brilliantly by Mickey Rourke, was a star professional wrestler in the 1980s. He had a legendary pay-per-view match against the Ayatollah in his prime, his own Nintendo game, posters, ""Best of The Ram"" VHS series and legions of fans who worshipped him. The film begins in the present day with The Ram collecting a paltry sum of money for his latest fight only to discover he's been locked out of his trailer home because he's behind on his rent. He has a good physique for his age - with the aid of steroids and tanning salons - he still has good friends in the local wrestling brotherhood and he enjoys hanging out with Cassidy (played by Marisa Tomei) at the strip club where she works. He's a likable guy and the neighbourhood kids look up to him as a hero, so it's easy to root for this washed-up old wrestler as he participates in choreographed, yet amazingly bloody, wrestling matches. He struggles to pay the rent while also searching for deeper meaning in his life as he knows that he can't wrestle forever. However, wrestling is the only thing he's good at, and he lives for those precious moments when he stands on the top turnbuckle and his adoring fans cheer his name ¬ñ but once he steps out of the ring his life is a mess. He'd like to reconcile with estranged daughter Stefanie (played by Evan Rachel Wood) but she hates him after he abandoned her in her youth. He's never given her a birthday gift, probably because he doesn't know which day it is.<br/><br/>There's a parallel story with Cassidy, an aging stripper. She also knows that her career is coming to an end, but unlike The Ram she seems to have plans after she retires, and her finances are in good order. They've obviously known each other for quite some time, and though there seems to be some mutual attraction Cassidy has always followed the rule ""don't get involved with a customer"". They have a complex relationship that changes throughout the film, but you can always feel that Cassidy cares about his well-being.<br/><br/>This movie works because it feels so real. All the characters are so natural in their roles that you'll feel drawn into this world of wrestling. Mickey Rourke doesn't just play a wrestler, he is a wrestling star, he is Randy The Ram in every way. The wrestling scenes were also amazingly crafted and you can see Randy build off the crowd's excitement. The film does a great job of showing why so many fans love ""fake"" wrestling.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed this little film but it's not for all tastes. It's gritty, raw, sometimes depressing, sometimes funny, and yeah I'll admit that I cried. A 9.5/10 for me and it's a must-see for wrestling fans (especially from 1980s era) and, obviously, anyone who enjoyed the previous works of Aranofsky and/or Rourke. Mickey Rourke and Marisa Tomei were both outstanding and Evan Rachel Wood also shone in her supporting role."

","As someone who's a fan and who has actually worked behind the scenes in pro wrestling, I can tell you that Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson's story is a very respectful and realistic portrayal of the toll pro wrestling takes on its stars' lives. Certainly not everyone in the biz ends up as destitute and lonely as Randy was - some do, definitely - but those who end up well-off in every sense of the word (like Hulk Hogan, John Cena, Stone Cold Steve Austin, and The Rock, for instance) are VERY, VERY rare. Most end up somewhere in between.<br/><br/>Interestingly, as precarious as Randy's health became, however, if he were in his mid-50's (as was Mickey Rourke at the time), he still had a longer pro wrestling career than many others who abused their body likewise. Randy still was made up of some very tough stuff and in fact beat the odds with his career length.<br/><br/>When asked ""is pro wrestling fake?"", I always answer, ""only where it needs to be"" - i.e., the story lines and SOME of the action. No one deliberately sets out to end another one's career, but like any other contact sport such as pro football, the athleticism and subsequent pain & injury are all TOO real. There's no ""off season"" in pro wrestling, and certainly no astronomically high salaries as other pro athletes make - not by a long shot. But in pro wrestling you'll find the best athletes in the world.<br/><br/>Bottom line: It's a brutal business and an extremely hard way to make a living - period. That's why the men and women who stick with it and suffer all they do is for one reason only - because they love it. May God bless them all. :)"
"MovieAddict2016","10","221","286","31 December 2008"," One of the best films of 2008
","Enough has been written already about Mickey Rourke's real-life parallels with his fictional character in The Wrestler. Yes, it makes the story seem even realer, and is perhaps what attracted Rourke to the project. (Or perhaps not ¬ó perhaps, instead, it is what attracted Darren Aronofsky to the actor.) But to focus on such surface similarities seems like an undermining of his work here. Rourke may not be as out-of-his-comfort-zone as Sean Penn in Milk, the only other Oscar-worthy lead performance this year, but that is merely a testament to his fundamental understanding of his character: Randy is an understated guy with big scars, both literally and figuratively. He's been wrestling for years ¬ó now reduced to borderline tribute shows in front of dwindling crowds, scrounging up barely enough cash to buy the variety of drugs and steroids he needs to maintain his weight. He lives in a trailer park and gets locked out for not being able to keep up rent. He works part-time at a grocery store and visits strip clubs regularly, because it's the only place where he seemingly has any meaningful connections with another human being ¬ó namely the dancer Cassidy (played by Marisa Tomei), who is similarly a bit older than most peers in her ""profession,"" yet doesn't really know any other way to live.<br/><br/>The Wrestler draws immediate comparison to the classics of working class cinema, including Rocky and On the Waterfront. Sylvester Stallone returned to his iconic character two years to bring resolution to the life of Rocky Balboa, the Philly boxer who got back in the ring for one final match . It was a good film and touched on similar themes ¬ó a nice guy stuck in a mean world, an estranged child¬ñ and ultimately both films present us with the dilemma these men find themselves in: too old to continue doing what they know best, and too old to learn how to do anything else.<br/><br/>Whereas Rocky Balboa was a trip down memory lane, it was hardly as bleak or frank as The Wrestler, which is a vastly superior film. Darren Aronofsky has established himself with this picture as one of the most important of modern American filmmakers; to acknowledge that this work is from the same man who directed The Fountain is astonishing, because they couldn't be farther apart on a sylistic level. The Wrestler is grainy, low-key and rough. It isn't polished, fantastical or elaborate. And that suits the material perfectly. The fact that Aronofsky was willing to almost entirely reinvent his approach for the benefit of the story is more than admirable. He deserves a nomination.<br/><br/>Tomei is wonderful in her supporting role, fleshing out her character (again, both literally and figuratively) with greater competence than most actresses would probably be able to manage, because it's a fairly obvious role ¬ó the ""stripper with a heart of gold"" who is the object of desire for the gruff guy with a tortured soul. Yet she manages to strike a balance in the film as one of two female roles, the other belonging to Evan Rachel Wood as Randy's emotionally severed daughter.<br/><br/>The Wrestler is impressive for all its smaller parts as well as the larger ones. When Randy goes to visit his daughter, the reaction is fleeting; it's not overly dramatic and revelatory, like most films of this nature often create such scenes to be. We can tell by her reaction that it's not the first time Randy has attempted to reconcile with her, as she seems unfazed by his appearance on her doorstep. It is in this fashion that the film jumps through all the mandatory hoops of its genre (think, of all things, The Royal Tenenbaums), yet still manages to seem fresh and realistic.<br/><br/>And then there's Rourke. As aforementioned, he deserves the Oscar nom he's likely to receive. And he should probably win. This is one of the best performances of the decade, perhaps even of all time, if we really want to get down to it. It's the best work of his career, at once the most fully developed of his characters and the most imperfect. Randy isn't airbrushed to make him seem more appealing to the audience; Aronofsky and Rourke exploit his faults and present him as a normal man, tempted by vices and haunted by his past. Yet we recognize that the drugs, the empty sex and the generally self-destructive behavior Randy partakes in is rooted in the same emotional enguish that the actor himself seems to carry with him; Aronofsky spotted this quality in Rourke, and he fought the producers for Rourke over their first choice (Nicolas Cage), and his dedication paid off ¬ó you'll be hard-pressed to find a more convincing, moving or memorable lead performance this year.<br/><br/>Ultimately, The Wrestler is one of the year's very best films ¬ó a character study that is at once timeless and powerful. And it's helmed by a director who has managed to bounce back from an aesthetically pleasing but shallow art-house film to produce one of the great works of American cinema in the 21st century."
"littlemartinarocena","9","291","384","10 November 2008"," The Return of Mickey Rourke
","Very rarely an artistic come back is so pointed, so truthful and/or so honest. Mickey Rourke is extraordinary here and I can assure you, he'll break your heart. ""It's not over until you (pointing at the audience) tell me its over"" Who was saying that? Mickey Rourke himself or his character? Both, I think both. I felt a chill run down my spine, the kind of chill you feel when confronted by an unvarnished truth. Darren Aronofsky is definitely someone to watch and to follow. His characters face limit situations and he finds torturous paths for them to travel. What makes the whole thing endurable is the unmistakable signs of self awareness. In ""The Wrestler"" the painful meeting between Ram and his daughter (played by Evan Rachel Wood) have the overwhelming weight of the truth without a hint of sentimentality. As we are approaching Oscar season I imagine already a fight to the finish between Sean Penn for ""Milk"" and Mickey Rourke for ""The Wrestler"" They both deserve the highest accolade. What a year!"
"preda01","10","179","241","21 November 2008"," Powerful Performance by Mickey Rourke
","The authenticity is the hallmark of this movie combined with vivid cinematography and set design. An amazing career-best performance from Mickey Rourke and outstanding work by Marisa Tomei and Evan Rachel Wood, the film is very powerful and emotional. Again, an exceptional achievement by a true artist-Rourke. His performance is so penetrating, wise, and authentic that it deserves the Oscar. Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson was the biggest wrestler in the world, back in the 80s. Now it's 2008 and while things have changed, in his head he's stuck back in good old days. He's still wrestling, even though the money and his audiences are long gone. His aging body can no longer take the punishment. Aronofsky really captures the magic in Mickey's performance. It is the true essence of method acting. He is ""The Ram""."
"hassa_3","8","8","8","16 March 2009"," Mickey Rourke's Resurrection
","Rarely does a talent like Mickey Rourke get a second chance at stardom. As the star of popular 80s films such as ""The Pope of Greenwich Village"" and ""Nine ¬Ω Weeks,"" Rourke was on the verge of super-stardom when addiction to drugs and alcohol left him a ""broken down piece of meat."" But we don't want to hate Mickey, we love Mickey. He stole the show in Sin City a few years back but now he has completely returned to top form. We are looking at the Hollywood version of Lazarus.<br/><br/>The Wrestler is one of the most gripping and emotional films of the past few years ¬ñ it's brutally honest and very realistic in how it tackles its subject matter. The film is so realistic it feels like a true documentary on underground wrestling. The camera follows Rourke's character, Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson, inside and outside the ring and stays close at all times. He may be playing a wrestler here but this is not WWE. There's no championship belt, the life he leads is by no means glamorous. He gets locked out of his trailer for not paying rent, he has a struggling love relationship with a stripper by night./mother by day and the only family he has, his daughter, doesn't even want to talk to him.<br/><br/>Rourke is the star here, he makes the film great. The raw intensity in his emotions connects with everyone in the theater and those who appreciate good art will be left breathless by his performance. The Ram is a gladiator, a gentle giant, trying to reclaim the success of his past. Maybe it's because it mirrors Mickey's own resurrection that we find his character so intriguing, but nonetheless the man bears his soul in this very entertaining film. There is such an emotional complexity to his character, by the last frames of the picture ¬ñ the audience feels like they've been apart of something special."
"Ludypro1","9","191","261","1 December 2008"," Amazing film that focuses on two often misjudged professions.
","Mickey Rourke returns to the big screen in Darren Aronofsky's brilliant character study, The Wrestler. Mickey Rourke gained about 35 pounds of muscle to play Randy 'The Ram' Robinson and looks the part of an old beaten down wrestler. Aronofsky creates a cold atmosphere that leaves the audience feeling as old and depressed as Rourke's character. The Wrestler doesn't have the look or feel of any previous Aronofsky film, it is mainly hand-held and has a gritty look to it that gives it a documentary feel. This film sucked me in. I really felt for the main character. I felt his pain and anger throughout the film. I felt his desperation. When a film has you reflecting the emotions expressed on the screen then it has accomplished something. I also appreciated that the story focused on two professions that are frowned upon in society, that being professional wrestling and stripping. Both professions are linked in the film and has the audience realize how similar they are. We also see the hardship of carrying out such a profession. I really enjoyed this film and had the pleasure of meeting the director after the showing. I was most impressed with him and can't wait till this film gets released."
"Superunknovvn","8","15","17","27 February 2009"," The role Mickey Rourke was born to play
","""The Wrestler"" is a beautiful movie, but it wouldn't be half as good if Mickey Rourke hadn't given the main character a face and a heart. There's virtually no other Hollywood actor that could have embodied Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson as perfectly as Rourke, and it's shocking to think how the movie could have turned out had someone else, say Bruce Willis or - as originally planned - Nicolas Cage played the part. With Rourke it's not so much an actor memorizing lines and delivering them convincingly, it's like watching a guy having gone through hell and now showing his scars. Rourke's performance even lets one overlook some rather clich√©d elements in the story (the exotic dancer with a golden heart, the neglected daughter, a dance in a romantic dilapidated ballroom). It's all good, because one look at Randy's face reminds us of all the hits and punches he must have taken in the past, and it all becomes real again.<br/><br/>So, Rourke obviously makes the movie, but that's not the only remarkable thing. Besides a very good performance by the beautiful Marisa Tomei, ""The Wrestler"" is also worth mentioning because it marks the first time Darren Aronofsky has made a straight forward drama that's not heavy headed or laden with too much symbolism. After the highly pretentious ""The Fountain"" such a movie was more than due. ""The Wrestler"" proves that Aronofsky is not only capable of stylistic extravaganza, but can also handle the art of ""plain"" storytelling.<br/><br/>The fine title song by Bruce Springsteen must not be forgotten, either. After ""Streets Of Philadelphia"" and ""Dead Man Walking"" this is his third soundtrack contribution that captures the feel of a movie beautifully. Props to Aronofsky for putting an emphasis on that song by letting it play over a black screen for a couple of seconds before the closing credits start to roll.<br/><br/>In the end, ""The Wrestler"" is such a huge success because Aronofsky made the right choice by insisting on Rourke to play the main role, and because Rourke more than lived up to the director's expectations. Sean Penn may have been very good in ""Milk"", but the character of The Wrestler is a thousand times more interesting and memorable, and considering that fact that Rourke will forever be remembered for this great performance, he would really have deserved the Oscar."
"alexkolokotronis","10","27","33","29 January 2009"," Indicative of Mickey Rourke's Career
","The Wrestler is a very good drama filled with originality. The film follows a fictional character named Randy ""Ram"" Robinson whose a ""has been"" wrestler. His prime far behind him and continues to wrestle hoping to get back in the lime light.<br/><br/>The acting Mickey Rourke was quite good deserving his Oscar nomination. His feelings of loneliness and isolation is very heart felt and sad to watch. His search for some sort of love becomes far more important to him as wrestling now endangers his life. He attempts to reconcile with his daughter played by Evan Rachel Wood and takes a love interest in a stripper played very well by Marisa Tomei. Altogether it culminates into a very sad, open but yet satisfying ending. The authenticity of all the emotions could not be better displayed by any other actor than Mickey Rourke who like his character shares many experiences and hardships in order to get back to fame. It brings out an amazing amount of depth out of his character and simply pushes the film to that of the least a very good movie.<br/><br/>The direction of Darren Aronofsky and writing of Robert Siegel combined for an amazingly heart felt sympathy portrayal of a man. The movie is left open yet simultaneously feels as if its all we need to know. That we've gotten what we need to see and can figure out things for ourselves. The abrasive and gritty look of the movie only adds to the emotions felt for the character. Usually I would not mention this at all but Bruce Springsteen's song was a superb song for the movie as he always captures the scope of a movie and its complicity.<br/><br/>Hopefully this film will set up Mickey Rourke for more films to make as he has certainly convinced me here that hes worthy of more lead roles. His comeback story is compelling in that he was literally a forgotten soul up until this was made. He reputation had dispersed so much that it took years of searching for distributors from Darren Aronofsky that would accept Mickey Rourke as the lead actor. Well it certainly payed off and it shouldn't of been made any other way."

","I saw the movie at the world premiere in Venice and Mickey Rourke, Darren Aronofsky and other crew members were also in the audience. When the credits began, people were jumping out of their seats (including me) applauding and cheering for more than 15 minutes. It was really amazing. I have been a Rourke fan for 10 years now and to me Darren Aronofsky is one of the greatest directors of the last ten years. So when I entered the cinema my expectations were as high as never before. But this 40 Euro ticket was worth every cent. I never saw such a moving performance by ""Sir Eddie Cook"" who played Randy ""the Ram"" with such authenticity that I was paralyzed for almost two hours. And that's because Rourke isn't just playing ""Ram"", he IS ""Ram"", at least a part of him (there are many parallels to his real troubled past). Aronofsky really did a great job and really pushed the actors to their limits. It is amazing to see how a good director can turn such a simple story into one of the greatest movies I have ever seen (and I watch hundreds of movies). So everybody who grew up in the 80's with wrestling, hard rock and Nintendo or just loves movies should see this - at least ten times. God bless you Darren, Mickey and all the other crew members for the best cinema experience I have ever had. no doubt about it."

","OK, after all the talk, literally, talk after talk of how wonderful Mickey Rourke's performance was in The Wrestler and that he's finally back in action. So I just had to see what all the hype was, especially after everyone started panicking when Sean Penn took the 2009 Oscar for Milk, I was curious if this movie really was as good as everyone was making it to be. So I'm going to give my honest opinion which either is going to get me a lot of hate mail or the ""un-useful"" marks on my comment, but I'm an honest user, I tell it like it is. The Wrestler is actually a really good movie, I would say that it was one of the top 10 that came out of 2008, but one thing that I really didn't like about the movie was the way it was made and the ending, which I'll explain why in a moment. Mickey Rourke does pull in a top performance, including Marisa Tomei, they took us on this heartbreaking story and made the movie into a small gem.<br/><br/>Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson, is a professional wrestler who was a major star in the 1980s but is now years past his prime and wrestling on the weekends for various independent promotions. Randy goes home and is locked out of his trailer for not paying the rent. Depressed, he takes pain medication and falls asleep in the back of his van. At night he visits a strip club where he has befriended a faded stripper named Pam, stage-named Cassidy. He continues the training rituals for his wrestling appearance, including steroid use and self-tanning. At his next show, Randy wrestles a brutal hardcore match, in which he and his opponent attack each other with thumbtacks, staple guns, barbed wire and glass. Post-match, Randy is treated for his wounds backstage, but he suffers a heart attack soon after and collapses. The heart attack necessitates a bypass operation and Randy is told by the doctor that his weakened heart cannot stand the stresses of steroids or wrestling. Randy cancels his upcoming matches and begins working as a deli counter operator at a supermarket. Randy visits his estranged daughter, Stephanie, whom he had left years before; she curses him and tells him to leave her alone. On his second visit to his daughter, Randy brings a thoughtful gift and admits that he has been a bad father; things seem to brighten up for him, but after a rough night, everything goes down hill for him again.<br/><br/>Now my two complaints, the way the movie was made, I understand what Darren Aronofsky was going for where he was trying to make us feel the realism, as if he was filming a day in our lives. But seeing the back of Mickey Rourke's head walking to work didn't exactly feel necessary to me, then there are scenes that cut too fast and made me do a double take. Then the ending, a lot of people are praising the ending, now I'm a huge film buff and I very much appreciate when a film leaves the audience with what they will give the to the movie. But for Randy's story, I felt like it was left incomplete, with him just doing his signature move and they cut to black, this is one of the stories I wished would have come to a complete circle where we see this poor man who's just broken down and find out what happened to him. I guess people are going to call this review stupid and think that I didn't understand it or don't appreciate the ""imagination"" factor, but honestly it's one of those endings I just felt a little cheated. But it is the performances that made this movie for me, they were real and gritty. It's the actors and the story that make The Wrestler worth watching.<br/><br/>7/10"

","If the phrase ""the little movie that could"" applies to any movie this year then it most certainly does to ""The Wrestler"". It is one of the best movies I've seen last year, and more than that it is even more special due to the brilliant and amazing performance of its cast.<br/><br/>The return of Mickey Rourke was overdue, a gifted and talented actor, who in my opinion was wrongly shunned and marginalized because of his past attitude and behaviour which marked him as a ""bad boy"". Hollywood surely likes to sometimes punish its own, especially those individuals who don't repent and crawl on their knees asking for ""cinematic forgiveness"" from their peers. What happened to Mickey Rourke was pure hypocrisy on the part of an industry that has no problem tolerating much, much worse behaviour on the part of less talented individuals; an industry that from time to time seeks to attain some kind of superficial saving grace marked by a phony mea culpa and a symbolic sacrificial lamb, in this case Mickey Rourke. I ask, how is what he did any different than the behaviour of let's say Lindsay Lohan, whom many critics where at one point anointing her as the next Jody Foster or Merryl Streep?!?!? Talk about self-imposed blindness! When I last saw Rourke in ""Sin City"", I was, albeit briefly but forcefully reminded, of how good of an actor he really is. So imagine my pleasure and anticipation when ""The Wrestler"" came out! At heart this is a story of redemption, but here comes the kick, it is actually an attempt and ultimate failure at redemption, at least in the sense that redemption is understood in today's society. This is a profoundly sad movie, but that fact does not take away one bit from the movie, rather it makes it more believable and even more powerful.<br/><br/>As Bruce Springsteen's song by the same title points out, there are some wrongs that can't be righted and some wounds that can't be mended, and that is the situation Mikey Rourke's character finds himself in. I don't want to discuss the movie in detail, nor give anything away from the plot or storyline, suffice to say that this is one viewing that is more than worth sitting through from beginning to end.<br/><br/>Rourke, Marisa Tomei (another grossly underrated actress) and Evan Rachel Wood are phenomenal and really hold their own and make the most of their on-screen time. Whatever award nominations and wins these actors are likely to get are more than deserved. Darren Aronofsky has really grown by leaps and bounds in his solid and varied career as director. I am personally glad that he decided to helm this project, the end result speaks for itself.<br/><br/>Ultimately there is redemption to be found in this movie, but it comes at a heavy price, to me that redemption takes the form of the triumph of the human spirit against insurmountable odds and seemingly impossible choices. These days that is a bold statement to make!"

","In Darren Aronofsky's brilliant character drama The Wrestler, Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson (Mickey Rourke) is a down-and-almost-out pro wrestler who grapples with his own mortality and a fear of being alone and desperate. Rourke is phenomenal, delivering a powerful, highly physical performance that will knock your socks off as much as if he'd clotheslined you himself. Rourke's Randy is intrepid, a scarred battle cruiser who desperately needs to be in the ring to survive, a man who's emotions are kept as close to the vest as possible, a man with nothing else going for him other than his time in the spotlight.<br/><br/>The Ram, probably an amalgam of several real-life wrestlers (chief among them, Randy ""Macho Man"" Savage), is a relic of the 1980s, a man who wistfully counts the scars and cuts on his body and remembers with great fondness his greatest ring moment, a pay-per-view battle against The Ayatollah. But twenty years later, he's wrestling in high-school gymnasiums, barely able to put on a decent show but still basking in any glory he can find. But the gigs hardly pay at all, and more than once The Ram is unable to pay the rent on his mobile home.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, two people enter (and reenter) Randy's life. Cassidy (Marisa Tomei) is a stripper at a low-rent club that Randy frequents. Cassidy is just about the only person in the world that Randy can talk to; he's lonely, spending most of his postmatch time either drinking alone or patching up any new wounds. He's treading water; with no life outside of wrestling, he's just trying to make it through the night intact.<br/><br/>Reentering Randy's life is his long-estranged daughter, played by Evan Rachel Wood, who's hated her dad for years after he abandoned the family. Randy, in case you're still not certain, is not meant to be an entirely sympathetic figure; you know why he is how he is, and you do feel bad for him, but you also understand that just about everything that's made him who he is today is due to his own decisions. The Ram is not a victim.<br/><br/>Aside from the simple I'm-getting-too-old-for-this angle, there's a serious medical angel that presents itself early in the movie - keep on wrestling, the doctor warns, and you'll likely die in the ring. And to his credit, Randy does attempt to stop his own livelihood, but he quickly - and harshly - realizes how incredibly difficult that is. The real world doesn't want him, The Ram thinks. They only want what's in the ring.<br/><br/>Rourke is outstanding, perhaps sparking his own career renaissance, and Tomei is simply terrific as Cassidy. Tomei is a perfect physical fit for the role of the rapidly aging stripper; she's still gorgeous, but there are just enough lines on her face to make her age believable. Tomei continues to make excellent role choices, and she completely knocks this one out of the park. Her Cassidy hurts as much on the inside - and what movie stripper doesn't? - as Randy appears to on the outside, and they have much in common. It's gratifying to see Cassidy's feelings toward Randy evolve throughout the movie.<br/><br/>There are also several matches featuring The Ram, one of which should really appeal to wrestling fans: a hardcore match. In this kind of match, literally anything goes - barbed wire, windows, tables, chairs, anything. Yes, we all know that pro wrestling is fake, but it's fake really only in terms of the final outcome, with just a few guidelines worked out between the competitors beforehand (e.g., I'll hit you low, then you leg whip me). And of course these particular matches were staged and scripted, but man did they ever look real. You want to see something scary, check out Randy after the hardcore match, when staples - from a staple gun - are removed from his body.<br/><br/>The Wrestler is a gritty, raw look at one man's desire to keep on keepin' on, trying to survive the only way that's still open to him, while trying desperately to connect with someone emotionally as he ages. It's heartwarming but also heart-wrenching, and the somewhat-ambiguous ending is sure to confound people who like their movies to end tidily. It's a masterpiece for Rourke, another tour-de-force for Tomei, and an award-worthy effort for Aronofsky."

","Billed as Mickey Rourke's big comeback, this film is the finale presentation of the New York Film Festival 2008. Awarded in Venice and shown at Toronto, it features a winning performance by Rourke. It's a simple story, a mixture of raw authenticity and old fashioned corn about a washed up professional wrestler who's 20 years past his prime and resists admitting it till he has a heart attack and is forced t turn to the only two people he has in his life, a lap dancer and an estranged daughter. It's pretty monochromatic and claustrophobic, but the tiny framework shows off Rourke's generous, authoritative performance. Rourke's weathered, soulful face and sweet-sad smile sell the movie.<br/><br/>Early scenes establish that Randy 'The Ram' Robinson (Rourke), who has long graying bleach-blond hair and wears a hearing aid, still has fans from his heyday in the 80's and warm contacts in the pro wrestler community of today, who give him work on weekends. He's well liked (kids in his neighborhood clamor around him), and takes life's hard knocks with patience--and that smile.<br/><br/>But all is not well. The first night we see him after a fight locked out of his trailer because he owes the manager money. He lives alone, has a shaky relationship with a lap dancer, work name Cassidy (Marisa Tomei). His lesbian daughter Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood), who's in school, despises him for not being there when he was needed. We're in the world of numbed pain and charred, sealed-away emotions here.<br/><br/>The second evening of fights pits the Ram against an S/M wrestler who uses a staple gun on him, and broken glass, and barbed wire. Ram collapses after this fight and wakes up in intensive care after a bypass operation. The hospital is the real beginning of the film, though Rourke and the filmmakers are over-committed to the wrestling scene, and stage more painful and realistic bouts, in which all the fighters other than Rourke were professionals.<br/><br/>Ram realizes he's not the man he was. The doctor has told him he can't wrestle any more. He tries to jog and can't. Helpless and alone, he turns to Cassidy (whose real name is Pam), but she is reluctant to admit he's more than a customer. He visits his daughter, but she is extremely hostile. In just a couple scenes, Evan Rachel Wood is raw and powerful. Tomei is authentic too, having mastered the lap-dancing technique and assimilated its world's mix of sensuality and distance. Rourke/Ram's encounters with both women are painful and memorable.<br/><br/>There's a good sense of context, even though Ram's world as shown is narrow. ""The 90's f----ing sucked!"" he exclaims to Cassidy when he finally coaxes her into having a beer with him outside the club. He hates that bastard Kurt Cobain. Axel Rose was The Man. You realize she's as washed up as he is. She has a 9-year-old kid and wants to quit and somehow get into a condo.<br/><br/>The screenplay by Roy Siegel, an original editor of The Onion, has lightness and humor to undercut the melodrama and doom. Ram is a laugh when, after the heart attack, he starts working longer hours at the Jersey Dollar's deli counter, doling out potato salad and ham, joking with the man and flattering the women.<br/><br/>Finally after he is pushed away by Cassidy/Pam, on a bad day at the deli, Ram flashily quits and calls a promoter and countermands his resignations, saying the re-match with ""The Ayatollah"" is on again. The Aronofsky of 'Requiem for a Dream' set a record for determinism, and it's hard not to see this Wrestler as doomed. But the filmmakers' and and cast's involvement in the milieu and Rourke's humility and charm undercut that enough so the final sequence is uncertain and interesting. And all the fights are good.<br/><br/>The title 'The Wrestler' can be generic because unlike boxing films, wrestling ones are rare, indeed nonexistent. Rourke himself is a boxer; the switchover wasn't easy, but he had the athletic background, and not only that, the has-been life of his character, a washed-up star in an activity looked down on by all but rabid fans. Few think of it even as a sport, though it requires conditioning and skill and involves constant injuries. In the NYFF Q&A Rourke conveyed a sense of his respect for this activity as a sport, and Aronofsky reported that his work on the mat won the approval of the pros. If this is an iconic performance as some are saying, it's not just Rourke's personal identification with the character's comeback mode, but good hard technical work to make it all authentic."

","There is no greater blow to the ego of a once formidable athlete or entertainer than when the cheers stop. ""The Wrestler"" is a poignant film because it touches on two fears most people have at some point in their lives: irrelevance and loneliness. Former pro wrestler Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson (wonderfully played by Mickey Rourke)was once a superstar but now is a broken down, financially strapped has-been living in a trailer. He is estranged from his teenage daughter, whom he left years ago. His only meaningful relationship is with stripper Cassidy, herself a middle aged person in a profession filled with younger competition. When a heart attack forces Ram to stop wrestling, he realizes just how difficult it is to transition away from the only life he's ever known.<br/><br/>Rourke's humane portrayal of ""The Ram"" engenders immediate viewer sympathy. He is a tragic figure, his heyday long gone. He sadly muddles through life a lonely, washed up ex-wrestler playing sparsely attended venues and working as a part time grocery store employee. Perhaps the saddest part of the film is his failed reconciliation with his daughter. While having empty sex and taking cocaine after an event, he accidentally stands her up on a dinner date, destroying the sliver of trust he'd built up and ending any chance of ever having a relationship with her. Unable to live comfortably and conventionally in an uncaring world, Ram goes back into the ring for one final battle.<br/><br/>One does not have to be a wrestling fan to appreciate this film. ""The Wrestler"" reminds us what can happen when we wrap too much of ourselves into our profession and do not maintain balance in our lives. Rourke perfectly embodies the washed up ex-athlete looking to find his way and in my opinion was cheated out of an Oscar; the Academy instead going for the ""safe"" pick in Sean Penn. No matter, however, ""The Wrestler"" is very well done."

","'The Wrestler' starts off with an introduction of Randy The Ram, 20 years ago when he was a star who had everything going for him in the professional field. Then it jumps to present day where the camera is held behind Randy's head, showing us what he sees. The execution of 'The Wrestler' is different from Aronofsky's other films. It has a less polished look and the hand-held camera gives it a documentary feel but at the same time Randy's private moments feel real rather than staged. The use of background music is very limited. The movie has a sort of cold, gloomy and depressive atmospheric feel which is exactly how Randy experiences his surroundings). The well shot and choreographed wrestling scenes are brutal and graphic. Even though the wrestlers are shown to be friendly outside the ring and what goes on inside is really a 'performance', the blood is real, and so is the pain.<br/><br/>Siegel's writing is solid and Aronofsky's portrayal of the character is quite remarkable. Randy The Ram isn't a caricature aggressive wrestler who's hooked on drugs and shagging every women that comes his way. He's depicted quite a nice guy, with good friends in his field of profession and the kids in his neighborhood look up to him. He's quite friendly and is in love with a stripper, Cassidy. But, Cassidy tries to strictly abide by the rule not to socialize with customers. Yet, she cares about him.<br/><br/>Interestingly, her story parallels with Randy's. She's also aging in her profession and her time is almost up. But, unlike the former wrestler, she is prepared and has plans for the future. Whereas Randy is more unfortunate and he struggles to make it in the real world as his attempts fail.<br/><br/>'The Wrestler' grips one right from the start and involves the viewer in the protagonist's life. It feels eerily real. The acting is so natural. Mickey Rourke gives the performance of a lifetime. He looks the part, exudes the energy, brings compassion and is difficult to recognize which makes it all the more easy to forget that you are actually watching an actor act. Marisa Tomei is fantastic as Rourke's semi-counterpart. Evan Rachel Wood shines as Randy's estranged daughter.<br/><br/>I have admired Aronofsky for his attempt in making different kinds of cinema and giving us great movies and 'The Wrestler' is no disappointment at all. It is a brutally honest piece of cinema. Aronofsky is a remarkable filmmaker and 'The Wrestler' is another proof of that."
"gpaltrow2001","7","4","4","8 February 2009"," 'Rocky' and 'Milk' it ain't
","There are many comparisons to 'Rocky' in that this is a movie about a down-and-out athlete with a final chance at glory. Well, as much as Sly made a little film, it was still a Hollywood audience-pleaser. This is beyond gritty, with no qualms about leaving the audience let down. Sean Penn in 'Milk' might deserve the Oscar, but Mickey Rourke may get it. Sean Penn is an Oscar-winner, and while he is at the top of his game, he is still 'acting' in a Hollywood-type film. Mickey Rourke IS The Wrestler. This is a one-time only chance for him to win, since we are basically seeing his real life of the last 20 years play out allegorically. Since Penn has already won, Rourke may walk away with the statue. 'The Wrestler' surprised me with how it failed to pull its punches, so to speak. It was barbaric, rough, claustrophobic, and pathetic. I gave it a 7 because of the balance between Rourke's great performance, and the film's refusal to let us enjoy it. Marisa Tomei was a revelation-- her performance was difficult and fearless. I was with an audience of mostly middle-aged people who couldn't get into 'The Reader' or 'Milk' because they were sold out. The quiet at the end of the film told me they were just hit over the head with a metal folding chair, and were a bit stunned. My girlfriend had to close her eyes at some of the more brutal scenes. This is a tough-as-nails, street, gritty and grimy movie that just isn't for everyone. Thank God for films like this."

","I really enjoyed this movie, which tells the tale of Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson (Mickey Rourke), a former big-time pro wrestler fallen on hard times, most of which seem to be the result not of bad luck but bad planning and bad habits. Forced to compete in violent and dangerous stunt matches with other former big-timers and young wannabe wrestlers.<br/><br/>It's the first film about pro wrestling that I've seen which shows the amount of brotherhood that exists between many of the wrestlers, the amount of planning and skill that goes into the matches, and so forth. It's also a story about a once great athlete, and so at times it veers or threatens to veer into rather standard melodramatic territory. For instance, the sub-plot with Randy's daughter (Evan Rachel Wood) is fraught with peril but I'd say they did an OK job of it. I definitely like the Marisa Tomei character, even if the stripper with a heart of gold is sort of a clich√©. I think Tomei and Rourke were able not only to put over a role that could be considered a stereotype, but to make a statement on the idea of typing in general. They are just such unique personages in terms of how they come off the screen, it defies the way that we tend to see each other in life in terms of very standard types. Randy is at the same time not what he seems at first to be and also the ultimate version of what he seems to be -- a fallen champion desperate to get back on top, but without the goods he needs to do it.<br/><br/>The music is fun and a blast to hear after all these years, even if it wasn't my favorite at the time. I imagine there are lots of younger people today discovering the joys of Guns N' Roses and various bands like that thanks to this film which shows them in the same kind of nostalgic but steady-eyed perspective as Randy himself. People like ""The Ram"" were the rulers of the world when I was a little kid in the 80s, and it's sad to think about some of them really falling from those positions. We could look at the pathetic aspects of Randy's life but at the same time he actually accomplished more than a lot of people ever do. The fact that he couldn't maintain a personal life ended up making the whole thing bitter and pointless in the end. Rourke performs the part perfectly, with a sense of pride and no regrets, a man waking up to certain realities that he's spent a lot of time and money trying to avoid."

","It's a fascinating thought I had going into Darren Aronofsky's The Wrestler, screened at the Toronto International Film Festival. I began to worry that a straightforward tale may not be playing to the director's strengths. It wasn't until the end credits that I recalled Requiem For a Dream being an adaptation and his debut œÄ being pretty grounded in reality despite its surrealistic tendencies. So in actuality, the guy had only made one non-straightforward film, and all to immense success, at least in my eyes. So, as of now, the guy is four for four. Not only does Mickey Rourke own the screen every second of the movie, but Aronofsky lends just the right amount of his stamp on the proceedings, creating a definite top ten inclusion for my end of year list and, by far, the best film I had seen at the festival.<br/><br/>The story deals with an aging professional wrestler, a man that was a champion and idol in his heyday. Beaten and battered, Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson finds himself doing small venues on the weekends, trying to relive past glory and entertain the fans still out there, while working at a grocery store during the week. Not having stopped with the working out, he also continues to take any drugs necessary to keep his physique as well as numb the pain of what ails him. Money is tight, the camps' landlord locks him out of his trailer; family is non-existent, his daughter wants nothing to do with him; and the only real human interaction he has is from a stripper (Marisa Tomei's Cassidy) he pays more for an ear to talk than for the lapdances. The Ram remembers the past¬óan old action figure of himself stands on his van's dash¬óand does his best to keep it in the front of his mind. A wonderful example comes when he yells out his trailer to a neighborhood kid; asking if wants to play Nintendo. The two play a boxing game, Robinson of course as himself, while the boy talks about the new Call of Duty game coming out on Playstations, et al. This gap in culture and reality never hits him hard, though, as he loves the decade that built him too much.<br/><br/>It is a heart attack that finally wakes Rourke's character from his long slumber of indifference and living without consequence. With a masterstroke of subtlety, Aronofsky begins to show his hand at this point. We begin to look around the locales The Ram visits. An autograph session is one example, rather than like the beginning, watching two enthusiastic fans get his signature and talk to each other about how nice a guy he is, we now watch a pan across the room at those selling their John Hancocks. Some of the wrestlers are older than he, and others not, however, they all have one thing in common¬óa slow dismantling of their bodies from the hard, fast lifestyle they lived. We see canes, wheelchairs, sorrow, and pain etched in every face. The Ram finally realizes the risk he takes each time he steps in that ring and decides to retool his life for the future by attempting to rekindle a relationship with his daughter, a nice performance from Evan Rachel Wood; maybe start one with Cassidy, for real, not at the club; and take an invested interest at making a career out of the grocery store gig. It all helps establish a feeling that it could all be working out for him.<br/><br/>The story is not that simple, though. What really hit home for me was the absolute frankness and unsentimental tone The Wrestler truly portrays. A great line comes with Rourke in the ring, about to fight, despite someone telling him he doesn't have to get hurt; he can stop. The Ram just looks back and says, ""I only get hurt out there,"" pointing to the outside world. That ring is his safe haven, the one place he is loved unconditionally by fans and peers alike, the ropes serving as walls against the prejudices, looks, and pain awaiting him out in the real world. He is a wrestler to the bone, expressed earlier with a viciously orchestrated battle involving tables, staple guns, and barbed wire. The entire film is really just a slice of life following The Ram around as he figures out the path that works for him. Sometimes the costume is the real person¬ójust ask Superman¬óand to go back to being Robin Randinski becomes too much to handle.<br/><br/>It's a performance worthy of award and a tale succeeding on all counts. Aronofsky is not shy to work some magic, nor afraid to let the story take control when necessary. All the glamour and celebrity is there along with the flip side of the coin when gravity kicks in. An amazing experience to be sure, you won't want to get up at its conclusion, (the wonderful new Bruce Springsteen song definitely helps this fact), instead staying to contemplate what has happened and what might happen, as the filmmakers throw a question mark at you. Whether Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson is content, we will never know, but one thing we do is that he lived without regret. It may not have all turned out the way he wanted, but in the end he a man that will not, that cannot, change. And he doesn't have to."
"Christopher_Reid","10","3","3","5 March 2015"," Powerful and beautiful, brilliant acting and directing
","The Wrestler looked and felt a lot like a documentary. It doesn't seem like we're getting lines of rehearsed dialogue, it's just spontaneous and real. This style isn't just a gimmick though, it's incredibly engaging. Perhaps that's the attraction of reality TV. Even though so many of those shows are absolutely awful, people still watch them. Something about the truth, real people and places and situations is addictive and draws you in.<br/><br/>It was impressive how quickly we're given a sense of who Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson is and was. In the early scenes, the movie simply observes him. In this way it can say a lot without seeming to try to say anything at all. There are so many details - the timing of things, a sigh, an expression. You can feel Randy's exhaustion. His body is big but broken, even tortured. You sense his soul has been a bit battered as well. But he's really friendly to the local kids and any of his fans that he meets. He's got a big heart. He smiles and jokes around with customers at a grocery store. This makes it all the more sad how empty and down his life is.<br/><br/>Marisa Tomei is really good in her role. She has such strong eyes. The way she can really look at someone deeply and understand who they are. Her character is concealing some kind of pain. She is similar to Randy in that she abuses her body in her work. She does things to her body for the entertainment of crowds, as he does. They share a deeper connection because of this.<br/><br/>Some of the strongest scenes are when Randy tries to reconnect with his daughter. It pulls no punches. Perhaps the deepest anger/hatred comes from those who love us. He obviously let her down in the past and hopes that maybe she'll forgive him. A bit like the old guy in Home Alone. There's no answer for that kind of stuff, no guaranteed comfort. All you can do is make an effort and hope for the best. The point is we see how much they both care and it's both beautiful and sad that they have so much love but struggle to form a positive relationship with each other.<br/><br/>What's The Wrestler about? The way things change, the way things don't change. The way the things that destroy us are sometimes the only things that bring us joy. The way our flaws can gradually ruin our lives. The way everyone has so many imperfections. I don't know, but I found it incredibly insightful and emotionally affecting. There is a lot of strength in Randy. I have a lot of respect for people like that, who can at least be up front about who they are, who apologise for mistakes and always try to improve and learn, who are passionate and hard-working and generous. Maybe that's the miracle that those qualities still exist in Randy even with what he's been through. Maybe he was a complete jerk in the past. But it's very sad seeing a kind man trying to pick up the pieces so many years later. He's very hard on himself and I related strongly to that.<br/><br/>Of course, Mickey Rourke is really great in the main role and it's fascinating how it parallels his own career comeback. It does seem to give it a deeper resonance. Darren Aronofsky was already an interesting filmmaker after Pi and Requiem for a Dream. With The Fighter and The Wrestler, I'd say he's one of the most insightful directors when it comes to portraying the human condition. Our flaws, relationships, triumphs and mistakes."
"yjalil","9","3","3","5 September 2009"," Heartbreaking....Amazingly Crafted
","The Wrestler is probably Rourke's defining work to date. He shows a depth to his acting that his rarely come through in his earlier films (including the excellent Sin City). The story evolves gently, deliberately, notwithstanding the interjection of the violence surrounding the wrestling matches. Most importantly, the director does an excellent job of showing the mutual respect and camaraderie that exists among professional wrestlers - a code of honor that ultimately attracts and keeps Rourke's character engaged in the world of wrestling 20+ years after he has passed his prime. The storyline also does an excellent job of helping viewers empathize with why fans like what they probably know is pre-scripted wrestling, and finds a chord of genuine-ness in their cheers and emotions. This chord of truth in fans' adoration and emotion is what the Rourke character finds so difficult to pull himself away from, and at the end, why this seems more ""real"" to him than the real-world. As the movie progresses, it becomes clear that the professionals wrestlers - men line Rourke's character share a higher code of honor among themselves and genuinely look out for each other. Outside of this world of peers, the Ram is completely dysfunctional and unable to operate any of his relationships effectively - whether with would-be girlfriend Cassidy (Pam)or daughter Stephanie. Ultimately, the story is heart-wrenching, and it draws its viewers in, unfolding with great heart and emotion, just like its protagonist. Highly recommended!!"

The story is really run of the mill, and there are a few suspect subplots (his daughter for instance) that don't really add to the film in anyway.<br/><br/>One thing is for sure though, Mickey Rourke IS this film. It makes it everything it is and is well worth it. He is totally astounding as Randy ""the Ram"" and leaves you feeling heartbroken for him and his circumstances.<br/><br/>Its sweet, funny at times and overall, incredibly sad.<br/><br/>I really want people to see this film. I will also be very disappointed if Mickey doesn't get best actor for this one."
"bob the moo","Null","9","13","23 January 2009"," Not as perfect a film as is being said, but a great character study that subverts the sports genre to be suitably drab and real (which is a compliment)
","After the imagination and creativity shown in The Fountain, The Wrestler initially strikes the viewer as a bit of a disappointment because director Darren Aronofsky appears to have gone to the other extreme of style and has delivered a film that is very much in the real world, with no flights of fancy and no real visual flair to it. However in the same way as The Fountain was about the heart of the central male character, The Wrestler is the same, just with a totally different character struggling with a totally different set of emotions. As a faded wrestler, Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson is living in a trailer park where he can barely keep up the rent, during the week he works a manual job in the stock room of a local supermarket and at weekends he dons his costume and takes part in wrestling events in small and only partially filled leisure centres and halls.<br/><br/>The nature of the character has been talked to death already, mainly because of the actor playing him and how good his performance is, but Randy is a fairly simplistic character on paper. Indeed the whole film has a very simple concept right down to the ""stripper with the heart of gold"", and in different hands this would have been more uplifting than it is but then also less realistic and less interesting. As it is The Wrestler delivers a singularly grim depiction of a man unsure of what to do in life and clinging to the buzz he still gets performing in front of the dwindling crowds even though the personal cost of this is clear in every part of his life. It is almost documentarian in its approach and often the camera is following Randy rather than moving in such a way to inform the viewer (although it does this as well). This makes the film feel very bleak and, like Randy himself, perhaps that it is not really going to go anywhere. Those still looking for a big redemption or sporting achievement have been watching too many generic sports movie and have not been paying attention to the way this is being told.<br/><br/>So what is it about the visually ""straight"" delivery and grimy and very downbeat story that makes this film worth seeing? Well, the awards chatter will already have told you that because what makes it is the performances that bring the film to life. Without these Aronofsky's twisting of the sports genre looking at faded male hopes would have been an interesting but quite dull affair and I think he knows this which is why his focus is so much on the characters. Much has been made of the parallels between Rourke and his character but such commentary detracts from his performance, which is great. It is not in one dialogue scene or one specific thing he does, but Rourke manages to utterly convince as Randy in his mannerism, the way he carries himself, the small moments of joy he has, the look he has in his eyes and the pain (physical and emotional) that his life has brought him to. That there isn't a clear ""Oscar clip"" is a sign of how good it is because it is not something he ""delivers"" so much as ""is"". The same could be said for Tomei, although again some have detracted from her turn by focusing on the fact that her body is fantastic (which admittedly it is; not ""for her age"" ¬ñ just fantastic). She doesn't have as much time to shine but she becomes more impressive when you consider that, on paper, her character is a real clich√© that is like a direct shadow of Randy in terms of situation (aging out of the only world she knows). That she makes it better than this is down to how much she gets out of her eyes and face. They work well together but she does feel like she is acting whereas Rourke convinces totally.<br/><br/>Despite what the voters on this site say (the 60th best film EVER! Really?) The Wrestler is not a great film that will blow you away at any point. Indeed I think many people will be surprised by how slow and slightly drab it is. However where it is strongest is in the area it sets out to be all about ¬ñ a character study. This aspect works thanks to Aronofsky sticking close to his subjects even if it is grim or dull and by getting great performances from the two central performers. As a total film then, I thought it was good but not great and that it has benefited generally from how good Rourke is in it. Worth seeing but don't let the hype mislead you into expecting something that The Wrestler never pertains to be."
"MattDevivre","9","29","52","6 November 2008"," Another great job by Aronofsky !
","Since ""Requiem for a Dream"" I am a fan of Aronofskys work. He could be one of very few US directors people will continue to talk about in many years from now. His pictures always touch essential parts of life and the use of metaphors is remarkable. <br/><br/>I saw ""The Wrestler"" at the Viennale Film Festival in Vienna. In some way it might be Aronofskys clearest and less metaphoric work up to this date. However considering this kind of theme it won't be easy to attract a large audience. Right now Wrestling isn't very popular and I think it has always had the image of a somewhat typical brainless ""men sport"". I fear that this image won't help selling an art-film. In fact this picture is a very existentialist and thoughtful piece of cinema. It affects more than just a business.<br/><br/>While on the first impression ""The Wrestler"" may seem ""clearer"", you still can't cut it down to a few words. It can be seen various ways, like a story about an ageing wrestler and showgirl who try to get back into life or as a film about show-business using those who are part of it, without really caring about them as person and so on. In any respect I think everyone should draw their own conclusions.<br/><br/>Comparing to former Aronofsky creations the picture language of ""The Wrestler"" is rougher. It is a much cheaper production. This style fits the theme of this film and makes it even more realistic. The visual style is not as dominant as for example during ""The Fountain"". A further plus of ""The Wrestler"" is the casting. I can't think of any better choice for ""The Ram"" than Mickey Rourke. Tomei is a wonderful choice.<br/><br/>Summing up: ""The Wrestler"" felt deep and moving. For me it was not as moving as ""Requiem for a Dream"" or ""The Fountain"" but nonetheless I think it's an excellent original drama. The best movie I've seen so far this year."
"mistarkus","7","7","10","26 December 2008"," The art of realism
","A movie about a professional wrestler is ironically a slice of life tale about a relatable, down to earth, common man. A universal theme of a man who's seen his prime come and go. A man trying to reconcile age with his profession, reconnect with his estranged daughter and form some sort of relationships and romance. Despite being of this extravagantly, oddly, special profession of a wrestler, everyday people will relate to the earthiness felt in this tale and moodily connect with the wintry nowhere Jersey.<br/><br/>We become exposed to the insides of the wrestling world, the fakeness of it, as we watch the ""combatants"" shake hands and fraternize before and after the bout, and the brutal realism of it, of the excruciatingly painful (even to watch) consensual physical torture just in order to get a rise out of the crowd.<br/><br/>The story doesn't amount to much but it is the art of realism. Effectively filmed like a reality show or home video with a shaky lower budget camera which gave the feeling of rawness, grittiness and simplicity taking us to the Wrestler's level. Simplicity in a movie can be profoundly powerful. But it must not get too simple where substance will be forfeited. This movie just toted that line and rose slightly above the ""too simple"" threshold.<br/><br/>The poetic feel of an earthy bluesiness transpires from such scenes as when the father and daughter as they try to reconnect stroll along the isolated boardwalks in the wintry Jersey beach. We are enveloped by a delightful melancholy as we become warmed by these soft scenes and the character's gentleness and heart. These scenes contrast dramatically to the wrestling matches and the character's size and identity and underlying macho-ism. <br/><br/>There are some flaws such as lack of development with the supporting characters. You especially wanted to know and feel more for Marisa Tomei's part and the lack of development in her character made it feel a bit empty. It seems far fetched that a Pro wrestler, one with a fan base, supposedly big star decades ago, with posters and action figures, that this larger than life ""idol?"", is so destitute that he has to live in a trailer (granted I am not familiar with pro wrestler's economic situation). . Maybe this should have been explained more, did he squander all his money, does he not make that much, does he not care to spend it? <br/><br/>The flaws don't scathe the root of the movie, like the pleasure derived when listening to the husky, raw voice of a great blues musician craning out the simplest lyrics, which is the art and poetry of realism"

There is no glimpse of hope. He is fighting FAKE fights, so there is no sympathy or action. His relationship with his daughter is so clich√© it's actually embarrassing. It's like watching 2 hours of Eastenders, you can't take anything good from it and although i know you're not meant to, why would anybody want to watch such a pointless piece of cinema?<br/><br/>It's like going, ""hey, let's watch this paint dry...

","If I hadn't seen the votes and the list of talent in this film, I might not even have given it a second thought, however it turned out to be an hour or so of fascination with the characters and the stories of their lives. The story surrounds a man's career choice as a professional wrestler, party animal and self interested life style that affects his personal relationship, his physical health and most importantly his daughter. He chose his work before family only to have ""life"" catch up with him in a matter of days with a major heart attack. Still living a trailer trash life, the wrestler realizes he has no one close to him and attempts to reach out after the doctor's recommendation is to stop wrestling all together. So the touching story of a big tough man who becomes emotionally brittle after this life event.<br/><br/>Rourke and Tomei team up in this film, both still looking great and they possess the down to earth male and female touch that the film emphasizes even though they live two very similar lives. Emotionally backwards and living with major issues. Somehow the wrestler reaches out and clutters his way into the lives of two women, his estranged daughter and a dancer he likes. The clincher to the film is the wrap up at the end. It is passionate, emotional and painful, but it so satisfying. One can't help but hope and fight for the characters as they suffer through their emotions."

Sadly, there was no movie theatre which could be ostentatiously quit! Not even any popcorn crumbs to crunch into the carpet on the way in an attempt to wake the fellow viewers from their stupour.<br/><br/>It was in the peace and comfort of our own home that we watched 'The Wrestler', an unshapely piece of movie junk, floating across the puddle of last year's Hollywood movies.<br/><br/>Usually, when upon checking your watch you realise you're already two thirds through the movie, and there is no clear indication that it is going somewhere else than the first 10 minutes of it suggests, I'd say it's a pretty bad sign.

First of all this film has no plot. The main core of events over here is a Wrestler and his sad life. What suppose to make us nailed to the screen is the mystery if his daughter is going to accept him, is the woman he loves going to be with him and if his sick heart is going to survive all that. I believe that all my neighbors of his age have much more interesting story to tell. And everything about this story is so predictable. Also, Micky Rourke's acting is worst than ever. Did you notice that he has not changed the face expression since the beginning of the movie? Apart from what I think of Mickey Rourke, in this movie he looks like Leather Face from Texas Chain Saw Massacre: there are no mimics, no presence of ordinary acting, no interaction with his surroundings, no energy. Over all, attempt to imply some documentary film elements in the movie is killing it even more because it's hiding some characters and movie dialogs which makes the film even more sterile and dull.

"DavidStewart57","10","5","7","4 September 2009"," Rourke's Finest Hour
","Every decade has at least one sports film that is timeless and original. In the 1960s, it was This Sporting Life. In the '70s, it was Rocky. In the '80s, it was Raging Bull. Darren Aronofsky's The Wrestler fits the list as the best sports film of the decade. The film follows Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson, a burnt-out, broke and downtrodden wrestler who tries to relive the glory days of his success by trying to make the ultimate comeback.<br/><br/>In the ring, Robinson takes down the wrestlers with guts and glory as he jumps from the turnbuckle and onto the mat. Behind the ring, he's either stocking shelves at a grocery store, befriending a middle-aged stripper, or alone in his van with only his memories and painkillers to keep him company. As he heals the wounds that would make a biblical stoning seem like a massage, Randy tries to remain upbeat and ready for anything as if the audience- at least what's left of them- are always there for him.<br/><br/>Aronofsky brilliantly captures the distinction between reality and fiction with a raw and unflinching eye mixed with Robert D. Siegel's original story of the jagged paths of glory Robinson tries to cross. Behind Siegel's script is a stunning cast. Marisa Tomei is stunning as Pam, a sexy and fragile stripper who befriends Rourke. The fragility and isolation Tomei faces while giving a lap dance or working the pole strikes similar chords to Sandra Oh's performance as an artistic exotic dancer in Dancing at the Blue Iguana. Evan Rachel Wood channels the emotional angst of her troubled protagonist in Thirteen in a mature fashion in her portrayal as Randy's estranged daughter.<br/><br/>The word ""comeback"" has been casually thrown around during awards season in the past when mentioning John Travolta in Pulp Fiction, or James Coburn in Affliction. Calling Mickey Rourke's performance as Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson a comeback would be an insult; it is watching a phoenix rising from the ashes of seclusion and personal defeat. Richard Harris's tenacity and battered body from This Sporting Life mixed with the self pity and fury of De Niro in Raging Bull equals Rourke's wrestling antihero. Seeing Rourke emotionally and physically battered and beaten to a pulp is like watching Icarus fall from grace; tragic, yet beautiful.<br/><br/>The Wrestler is a cinematic cocktail of Dante's Inferno and Dylan's ""Like A Rolling Stone""; a profound tale that will leave you emotionally and physically drained as if you spent 105 minutes in the ring."
"JimS_8686","10","5","7","19 April 2009"," ""Burning The Candle At Both Ends""
","I can't really expand much on what hasn't already been said in regards to this critics darling of a film. What I can add is the final scene where Randy The Ram gets on the top turnbuckle and you see genuine tears streaming from his eyes had quite an impact on me. I sat stunned in the theater as the ending credits rolled and Bruce Springsteen's inspired title song played on the soundtrack, realizing I had just gone through a gut-wrenching emotional cinematic experience.<br/><br/>What sets aside The Wrestler from the rest of the pack is that it evokes these emotions from the viewer not through manipulative clich√©d plot twists by the screenwriter, but from the performances. Rourke has always been a great actor, and this could quite possibly go down as his greatest role. But Marisa Tomei is a real heartbreaker in this film. Her performance of Cassidey is much more than a T&A role. You feel Randy The Ram's emotional turmoil as his heart gets yanked around by her continuously. As a single mother, Cassidey understandably devotes what little free time she has to providing her young son with the love and support she likely did not have growing up. <br/><br/>Naturally, Cassidey fights her emotions toward Randy not much unlike like The Ram grappling with a fellow roid-abusing opponent before a few hundred hardcore wrestling metal maniacs at a local high school gym every Saturday night.<br/><br/>The Ram achieved great success in the world of professional wrestling. In the late 80's, he was at the top of his game. 20 years later, the game is different. There are hardcore matches involving barbed wire, shattered glass, and staple guns. Younger athletes who looked up to the Ram when they were kids are now his competitors in the ring. But The Ram is a jack of very few trades. He must get a day job behind the deli counter at a supermarket to get out of the financial hole he dug himself into. His deteriorating health is an issue, but after damaging his relationship with his daughter beyond repair, and given up on a could-be relationship with Cassidy, The Ram makes a conscious decision to continue doing what he loves and does best. <br/><br/>Much has been said about the parallels between Randy The Ram and Rourke, the actor. This could very likely be what makes the movie a success. A shrewd gamble which paid nice dividends for Aronofsky - certainly one of the brightest young filmmakers out there today. Evan Rachel Wood capably holds her own sharing the frame with a powerhouse like MR. A bright future for this young actress should she avoid an alcohol and drug-induced meltdown like so many other hot young starlets.<br/><br/>Rourke and Tomei may not have walked home with Oscar gold, but their outstanding performances in The Wrestler will be immortalized in cinematic history forever."

","There is no denying that Darren Aronofsky's ""The Wrestler features two tremendous performances by Mickey Rourke and Marisa Tomei. But there's also no denying that former The Onion editor Robert Siegel's screenplay is rather conventional, plot-wise. And that does hamper this film.<br/><br/>Which is perhaps why Academy Award voters decided not to nominate ""The Wrestler"" for Best Picture or Siegel's screenplay. If you look at the other original screenplay nominees - Courtney Hunt for ""Frozen River,"" Mike Leigh for ""Happy-Go-Lucky,"" Martin McDonagh for ""In Bruges,"" Dustin Lance Black for ""Milk"" and Andrew Stanton and Jim Reardon for ""Wall-E"" - conventional or formulaic they certainly are not.<br/><br/>This is not to say that I didn't enjoy ""The Wrestler."" It is great to see Rourke back and acting to his fullest potential. Not only is this a juicy, meaty role - though some might argue he really isn't acting but simply being himself - but it is such a far cry that some of the crappy movies he came to be known for.<br/><br/>Perhaps it is because Rourke finds such a personal connection to Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson in ""The Wrestler"" that he is able to truly tap into the character's deepest fears and insecurities. Rourke is completely convincing as the once-famous, now washed-up wrestler peddling his talents at dingy venues and trying to eke out a living at mediocre autograph sessions. There's genuine angst in Rourke's performance and it is one that certainly propels the film forward.<br/><br/>Tomei, too, turns in a stunning performance as Cassidy, a stripper more by circumstance than by choice. It is a bravura turn by this one romantic-comedy lead. She has matured brilliantly as an actress and there really isn't a false note in her performance.<br/><br/>But then there's Siegel's screenplay. I realize there are tons of people who absolutely adore this film and my reaction to the movie isn't by any means meant to demean their adoration.<br/><br/>""The Wrestler"" starts out well and, for the first 30 minutes or so, kept me wondering where it was heading. It had a few genuinely nice surprises. But then comes the scene in the dressing room after a match. When that happened, I immediately knew how a conventional writer would unwind the plot. I hoped this film wouldn't, but it did. Everything I expected would happen happened. The twists, the turns, the character revelations - nothing that came after surprised me and that was a huge disappointment.<br/><br/>I would have expected something novel from Aronofsky, but he clings to Siegel's formulaic script and provides us with nothing that we couldn't have anticipated. I kept waiting for something to change my mind, but nothing did.<br/><br/>So what we're left to marvel at are Rourke's and Tomei's remarkably honest and, at times, brutally so, performances. And what I was left wondering was how much better, more trenchant, this film could have been with a more original screenplay."

I don't know why, I mean this movie wasn't the saddest movie I've seen (Requiem for a Dream, another Aronofsky film is an example of a movie that didn't make me cry, but should have.) Anyway, I'd just like to say that this movie now has a place in my heart. Other than the fact that it made my amount of man-points drop, its a great movie. The acting is fantastic and Mickey Rourke is probably the only reason I cried, he definitely deserves an Oscar for his performance. If Brad Pitt wins it for Benjamin Button I will kill whoever responsible (no disrespect to Pitt or Button, it was a pretty good movie.) It's a very simple plot, but somehow the movie turns out to be fantastic, Aronofsky is truly an amazing director, and one of my favorites.

"rpkunn","10","7","11","31 December 2008"," What can I say? Spellbound!!
","This is certainly the best film of 2008. Mickey Rourke as Randy 'The Ram' Robinson provides us a glimpse of what he is capable off in front of the camera. This is a character study more than cinematic genius. Most part of the movie, we see only the camera following Randy wherever he goes. More of a 'Dogma' styled work. But it is Rourke & Marisa Tomei (to a lesser extent) who takes this movie to great heights. In a way Aronofsky let the actors' do their part. There is no high-end gimmickry, special effects etc. We see the protagonist life as it is. Perhaps its budgetary constraints OR deliberate.<br/><br/>This is a rough movie. There is no fake blood. Everyone knows that (including myself) wrestling is staged. But the injuries are real. The camaraderie that these athletes have is incredible. In one of the most unforgettable scenes (towards the end), Randy is fighting 'The Ayatholla' (Ernest Miller), supposedly the 20 yr rematch. Of course 'The Ram' has to win the match. But will his heart allow? We see his opponent on the canvas but Randy is clutching his chest. His opponent is asking him to pin him up. But Randy has to do the dramatic - climb on the top rope and jump. But just before that he has a look at the far end of the arena to see if Tomei is still there. because she has left just before that final moment, Randy leaves a sigh and jumps. We can only guess what happens next. If she had stayed, possibly he would have just gone for a simple pin. But no, Randy has to do the risky move, because he knows he has nothing more to live for.<br/><br/>Will Rourke win the Oscar? I sincerely hope so. Besides the point of winning or loosing the coveted award, Rourke must be proud of his performance. For he has given us an incredible lesson in 'Method' acting. Next time when someone tells you that wrestling is staged, ask them to watch this movie. It may be staged, but the pain is very real and so is the blood.<br/><br/>The wrestler is a master work from a brilliant director."
"2hollywood2","10","7","11","18 December 2008"," Film Review - The Wrestler (****)
","Be warned, what you are about to read is my gushing over this film. I can't help it. It's my favorite of the year thus far although admittedly there are still a number of films I have yet to see.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky bounces back from his most recent and under appreciated fantasy film, ""The Fountain"" with his smooth and compelling Direction in ""The Wrestler."" Not the avant-garde style we've grown accustomed to with Aronofsky but he knocks it out of the park with the characters emotional prowess and his ability to make you deeply connect with them. The story, written by Robert Siegel, who previous to this has only one credit to his name, is a captivating and brutally honest story about a man coping with life when the only thing he has and has ever known is taken away from him leaving him alone with nothing but a search for who he is.<br/><br/>The arc of this film is flawless and it starts with an adrenaline pumping rendition of 80's metal band Quiet Riot's ""Bang Your Head"" blasting over a slow moving collage of fliers, posters, pictures and event tickets depicting the glory days of wrestling star Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson played by the talented but much maligned Mickey Rourke. You need not look any further than the lyrics of this song to find out who ""The Ram"" is. There's a love-fest with the 80's in that there are parallels the film has with 80's heavy metal music and the WWF during that time with Hulk Hogan and the Iron Sheik being part of pop culture, as it was in the early years here between ""The Ram"" and his adversary ""The Ayotolla"". The music is great and every time you hear an 80's song you get goosebumps... or is that just me? The films closing credits are no other than Bruce ""The Boss"" Springsteen with his gruff voice and Oscar buzzing song titled, go figure, ""The Wrestler"". Everything in between those two songs is a clinic on film making and a beautifully well made piece of art, taking you out of the glamor and limelight wrestling stars can obtain but into the behind the scenes world where you must face the repercussions of the physical abuse taken by nature of the sport as well as the lonely empty feeling of the audacious lifestyle.<br/><br/>Mickey Rourke in a career reviving role plays ""The Ram"" magnificently as a physically beaten up hanger-on wrestling star in the twilight of his career. Due to health concerns he's forced to retire and begins thinking about life after wrestling. Outside of his career, his only source of companionship's comes from the neighborhood kids, that actually seem to have enough sense to recognize ""The Ram's"" state of loneliness and a stripper that he's befriended at the local Strip Club that goes by the stage name Cassidy played rock solidly by a gorgeous Marisa Tomei. Tomei's fearless performance is so strong I would actually consider it to be her finest work to date, which is clearly a mouthful considering she won an Academy Award for her work in 'My Cousin Vinny"". She brings such a human element to a profession that you wouldn't likely find yourself rooting for, frankly, and she pulls off the challenging feat by leaving you actually feeling compassion and sadness for her. Incidentally, she looks amazing in this and let me just say there is plenty of her to see. Wow! It's clear there is a connection between Cassidy and ""The Ram"" that runs deeper than a typical customer-client relationship and when ""The Ram"" tells her of his retirement plans and hopes to take their relationship to the next level she suggests that he get in touch with his estranged teenage daughter whom he hardly knows after walking out on her while she was very young. The uber-talented Evan Rachel Wood continues her rise to super stardom with another poignantly strong performance as a teenage girl that wants her father back yet clearly deeply hurt but the damage that has already been done. When these worlds collide it's just beautiful cinema between two characters and I can see their scenes together being widely used in acting classes abroad. They should be anyway.<br/><br/>It's to often stated that a specific actor was ""born to play the role"" when a career defining piece of work vaults them into critical acclaim and a legitimate Oscar contender, which I will be shocked and extremely disappointed if Rourke isn't recognized with a nomination here, but in this case it is warranted. Rourke doesn't play ""The Ram"", Rourke IS ""The Ram"". This is what they mean when they say ""art imitating life."" I couldn't help but get the feeling that I was watching the internal struggles brought on by the reckless lifestyle of actor Mickey Rourke rather than that of Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson even though they are very much one in the same. The movie will stick with you and it's performances are eerie and haunting in a way that you want more, you miss them. You cannot help but acquire feelings for these characters on some level and there are many to subconsciously choose from. You name the emotion, and it is somewhere in the dynamics between the leads. One of the years best films, without a doubt."

","After seeing the greatness of MILK, SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE and THE DARK KNIGHT, I didn't think it would be possible to be floored once again by a 2008 motion picture. Last night though I wasn't only floored but I felt I was walking on air after watching Darren Aronofsky's near masterpiece, THE WRESTLER.<br/><br/>MIckey Rourke's performance is not one of just hype. He is the real deal here. Like Ledger in BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, he's able to inspire tears from the viewer without even having to say anything. It's in those sad soulful eyes and the beaten down affect of a person whose sole identity is based on the adoration of strangers. <br/><br/>Loneliness is the key ingredient here. Aronofsky films New Jersey in away you usually see in European films like ones from the Dardeene brothers. He really brings you into the world of those down and out in the United States, without being condescending at all. Aronofsky, educated at Harvard, is amazing in his depiction being so authentic of the strip clubs, soulless shopping centers, and trailer parks. I don't imagine he has lived in the world portrayed in THE WRESTLER but his portrays it so honestly that at times it felt like a documentation of everyday life. <br/><br/>THE WRESTLER is amazing, for while it's full of despair, gritty/desolate locations and people who are like ghosts from the 80's, it maintains this sense of hope that no matter who you are you will have someone out there who will love you. It reminded me of conventions I've gone to where former actors that used to be adored are now seen as relics, yet there are still those devoted fans that come out of the woodwork. THE WRESTLER has vivid authentic scenes portraying this subculture.<br/><br/>As for the actual wrestling, well not being a fan of the sport, I was absolutely riveted by all the sequence portraying the brutality of it and yet the extreme compassion that the wrestlers have for one another.<br/><br/>Anyway I could go on and on. There's a lot here to discuss including the dueling thread of Marisa Tomei and Mickey Rourke's characters both using there aging bodies to perform, and yet not knowing if they have anything else. There are some painful scenes of Tomei being rejected at the strip club where she works. The devastation and fear in her face should win her an Oscar.<br/><br/>So yes THE WRESTLER is my # 1 film of the year. I have not had an emotional response to a film like this since BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN!"

His strained relationship with his daughter haunts him as he seeks for connection with the people around him. ""The Wrestler"" is a powerful character study about acceptance and obsession, what we'll do to find meaning in the world and how much it takes before we have to let go.

","Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson is a pro-wrestler, who has seen his better days in the 80's, trying to make ends meet with small scale wrestling shows and part time job at a store warehouse.

Randy is a man, who has ruined his relationship with his only daughter and who's closest human relationship is with a stripper Cassidy.<br/><br/>The Wrestler could be another Rocky style sports movie. The premise, while revolving around a bit more absurd world of pro wrestling, is a bit similar. But Darren Aronofsky doesn't go there; The Ram doesn't end up as a similar underdog hero as Rocky did, because Randy is just that kind of a guy.<br/><br/>Aronofsky directs his well cast movie with a firm hand, nicely avoiding the most common clich√©s of every sports movie. Rourke does a great role as Randy. He feels at home in the role and you can't help but to compare The Ram to Rourke himself, as he has had his own falling out from the limelights. Also Marisa Tomei does nice and down to earth role as Cassidy, the love interest of Randy. She is both tough and fragile as a woman, who sees the both sides of Randy.<br/><br/>The Wrestler is same time both, a typical and untypical sport movie.

"johnnyboyz","8","2","2","15 December 2009"," Arriving with a slam onto the canvas, Aronofsky delivers one of the films of 2009.
","The Wrestler takes both a pretty well worn premise and a pretty familiar narrative and does what mostly all impressive film-makers and films alike do: breath new life into them. Nobody begrudges The Wrestler its down and out set up that it incurs onto its lead, nor do they begrudge The Wrestler for its narrative arc that leads us down a route which will usually end with a climactic fight of some description. In The Wrestler, director Aronofsky renders these situations and events more interesting than they ought to be by way of a scuzzy and low-level aesthetic which compliments the raw and pent up feelings and emotions many of the characters we focus on possess. The film is a real outsider look; a glance into the life of a guy on the fringes as he partakes in some pretty shocking activity and attempts to get by in whatever manner he can. In short, it's a really exhilarating and emotional experience.<br/><br/>The lead is Mickey Rourke's Randy the Ram, otherwise known as Randy when he isn't being referred to by his stage name. Randy was a big wrestler in the 1980s; big enough to have his name and what barely resembled his features by way of a few dozen pixels in an old, 1980s video game console wrestling game. He had a lot of fans - still does; and fought in a lot of big, high profile matches. Years later, he still operates on the circuit but at a much lower level. Rourke plays Randy pitch perfectly in regards as to whether he still enjoys wrestling as much as he used to. He sits, motionless in the locker room prior to fights contemplating whatever, while money is a problem as he balances a job in a convenience store during weekdays. Whether the drive is still there or not, the first instance of wrestling we're treated to in the film sees Randy kept until the last match so as to build to something ‚Äì the fans haven't left and are still there, everyone still loves him and wants to see him win his match.<br/><br/>Aronofsky shoots his lead, for the early duration, from behind at about head level. We rarely see Randy's face during the opening dozen minutes or so in what resembles a sort of third person video game perspective. Aronofsky does reveal his subject, but it's only at the times he is degraded or humiliated that we are able to look at him; the first instance of which is a reverse shot on some stairs when his boss at the shop insults his wrestling profession. The second is after a long tracking shot along the grounds of the trailer park in which he lives during which when he requests re-entry to his locked trailer from his landlord but is rejected due to late rental money. Randy turns around and, in what feels like an interior self-awareness of the camera on the character's behalf, faces us. The refraining from showing Randy's face early on apart from during these 'let-down' events aids Aronofsky's approach of creating a raw, very frontal and very exposed study of a man on the minorities and further aids in the alignment the audience will have towards him.<br/><br/>The event that calls into question Randy's own opinions on life, the universe and everything occurs shortly after one of the more brutal, unflinching sequences in a film from recent memory; so brutal, in fact, that Aronofsky shows us the results of said sequence prior to, and in tandem with, a wrestling match which involved all manner of sordid weaponry and gadgets. But in actuality, Randy comes off a little more worse-for-wear than he'd have liked, and his weekend profession of leaping, slamming and bashing other big, bulky men is called into question following a heart attack shortly afterwards. Randy's only confidant, or indeed person he even communicates with on a regular basis that isn't of the negative ilk, is a certain Cassidy (Tomei); a stripper at a local club who becomes more and more involved in his life outside of the seedy place of business Randy has often frequented in the past. That said, their first interaction with one another sees her berate him for scaring off a potential group of clients as Randy's inability to read situations and connect with what's going on between human beings is ably reinforced, when he interrupts a group of men seeking out a private dance with her when things appear to have gotten a little heated. ""200 bucks just walked out"" she bellows. Recent critical readings of her own body acting as a means of entertainment or as a 'service', like Randy's as a wrestler, are made apparent here. <br/><br/>The film brings to mind some of the writings from some years back about Hollywood and their attitudes towards their lead characters' bodies, predominantly in the action genre. The Wrestler sees its lead's body put through a similar physical grinder, one that sees it beaten, tested and pushed to the point of extreme. But the film brings these writings down to a lower, more visceral, level - we feel some of the pain with these wrestlers, and we certainly feel Randy's poor health infused pain. The film's crowning glory is in the form of the scene in which Randy meets up with his previously distant daughter named Stephanie (Wood), and they revisit a now decrepit old seaside funfair they used to frequent. She talks of the now burnt out ghost train, and how she found it truly frightening, although enjoyed going back in for some more. The sweetness of the scene lies within the fact that, no matter how much she previously despised him, she has at least inherited one aspect from her father: that sense of going through the grinder; through all the anguish and through the pain barrier, but in a perverse sort of way, enjoying it - all before coming back for some more."

This is down to earth look at the show wrestling, dangerous and brutal form of entertainment, and the guys who do it. No bull, no uplifting glorifying false moments, just a raw piece of this thing. And Mickey does well, maybe because he has been there, in the ring, in the backrooms, looking guys like these, actually he has been one of these guys, albeit as a boxer, so it is as real as any actor can do. Well done, Mickey. And welcome back. Some critics were bit antsy about the doping in this movie. Well, if you have been behind the facade of any sport, you know it is not a fluke thing nor an exception. It is there, in every sport. Here it is shown for what it is: unfortunately integral part of the show. Anybody who denies that fact is either lying or does not know what he/she is talking about. All and all, a good little movie."
"blackburnj-1","9","2","2","18 January 2009"," Rourke, Tomei and Aronofsky have crafted a must-see.
","Good acting requires good actors. Great acting requires great characters. A brief glance at any of cinemas greatest performances shows you that the quality of the character fuels the quality of the performance. Travis Bickle, Daniel Plainview, Lester Burnham and many others were all brilliantly brought to life, but there was something about them which was inherently attractive or intriguing which gripped the audience.<br/><br/>So it is with Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson, the beating heart of Darren Aronofsky's ""The Wrestler"". This character is a brilliant piece of writing (hats off to the film's scribe, Robert D. Siegel). The first half hour is dedicated to his persona, ""The Ram""; a quiet and much loved man backstage who becomes a loud and showy beast in the ring. But, when the wrestling subsides, we discover Randy Robinson (aka Randy Ramsinski), a charming but lonely man who treats himself pretty badly and finds himself to be ""an old broken down piece of meat"".<br/><br/>All sides of the eponymous character are brilliantly brought to life by Mickey Rourke, who creates a man who is sympathetic and engaging. He is also deeply flawed, as he craves and seeks a life outside of the ring but can only find happiness inside of it. Rourke's performance will make you love Randy, support him, cheer him on, but above all, come the end, you will be pleading with him, like all of the other characters around him, to stop.<br/><br/>The towering presence in the middle of the film is ably supported by Marisa Tomei. Tomei, as the stripper ""Cassidy"", who has the closest relationship with Randy of anyone in the whole film, is at her very best here. With this film being Rourke's ""comeback"", she could have ended up being ignored, but she more than holds her own and doesn't quite let Rourke run off with the film.<br/><br/>Another ""comeback"", of sorts, is from Darren Aronofsky. The failure of ""The Fountain"" will be all but forgotten after this solid piece of work which slowly builds up the tension and emotion and becomes a really gripping and enthralling film. He doesn't shy away from the violence and pain of the wrestling (yes it's fixed, but the people really do get hurt) but at no point do you feel that you're being asked to enjoy it, but the film's best moments are the quieter ones.<br/><br/>The end is a spine-tingling, ambiguous, final blast which will leave you thrilled. The melancholy of the final moments is a result of the fine craftsmanship of Siegel, Aronofsky, Tomei and Rourke. This is a film driven by character and emotion and, although you may feel that you've seen this story before at points, this is more than a simple drama. This is a brilliant, surprising, gripping and beautifully executed story."
"galileo3","9","2","2","17 January 2009"," raw, powerful, intense, bloody... The Wrestler is an authentic human drama with a formidable comeback performance from Rourke.
","The Wrestler (2008)<br/><br/>Top 5 - 2008<br/><br/>I am a strong advocate against Wrestling and even boxing - I think they are morally reprehensible and often disgusting activities. Despite this I have been consistently moved and impressed with the intensity and pathos of such sports movies. The Wrestler is no different.<br/><br/>The story of Randy 'The Ram' Robinson, an 80s Pro-wrestler, who still wrestles 20 years after his prime, in order to survive while doing the one thing he is good at. An added quality to this film, which may have been intentional by director Darren Aronofosky is the casting of Mickey Rourke. Aronofsky initially cast Nicolas Cage for the role, but replaced him for Rourke at a late stage - that decision is not regrettable. Mickey Rourke's fortunes from a rising, rough Hollywood star in the 80s (most notable for his film 9 1/2 weeks) to a downfall and a retreat into nothingness. Rourke is an actor, 'The Ram' is an ageing wrestler way past his glory days. The actor/character parallels serve to strengthen the film enormously - or at least that is how I felt.<br/><br/>Aronofsky's picture is an intensely human drama, about the harsh realities of life and a simultaneous examination of wrestling, a 'sport' I very much dislike - The film has a sequence of Wrestling (the version with various nasty weapons) where the wrestlers staple each other, pierce their skins on barbed wire and shards of glass and one of them even presses a fork against the other's forehead. How do these wrestlers feel? Does their job ever get a bit too much? How does Randy the Ram feel in his mid 50s when he continues to wrestle in order to survive? There is a great scene where old wrestling stars set up their products in order to make some profit from admirers. We see 'The Ram' with his hearing aid (probably a result of being thrown around for years), we see an old wrestler on a wheel chair and so on. I felt that scene brought out the unglamorous side of such entertainment sports and the long term consequences. I guess though if you play hard, you have to pay the price. Anyway, placing emphasis only on the wrestling is an incorrect interpretation of the film.<br/><br/>This is a film about the bitter realities of life for many people - The Ram's overextended wrestling life, his part time work as a supermarket worker carrying packages and then working at the deli counter - a stripper which Rourke likes but cannot quite connect with her as she does not go out with customers (altough she does warm up to him at the end). The Wrestler is also a person with feelings, not just an entertainer - the film shows how Randy struggles to reignite a relationship with his grown up daughter who he virtually neglected when she was growing up as he was constantly away on the circuit. The stripper also has a family and wishes to quit her awful profession. The film is also a remarkable reminder to the fact that many of us lead unhappy lives decided through the need for survival. There are many good things about this film, which I cannot encompass in this review.<br/><br/>Problems arise when Randy has a heart attack, from all the straining, brutal activity and the steroids he takes to boost his figure. He quits wrestling as instructed by the doctor that he will die if he undertakes extensive activity. Meanwhile he tries to connect with his daughter and get a friend out of the stripper Candice. Through various reasons and faults of his own, Randy fails to build up an emotional bubble to restore his loneliness and isolation. So he goes back to what he does best... Wrestling - a last exhibition match with his old nemesis named 'The Ayatollah' - he knows he may die as a result, but why should he live for nothing? Better go out in style, with his own family as he proclaims to the cheering audience who watches him with admiration. During the fight, The Ram experienced shortness of breath and is asked if okay. Hesitant, he continues, despite the risks. The last scene shows 'The Ram' ready to make his favourite move the top rope diving headbutt against Ayatollah. He gets on the rope raises his arms and the film cuts off...<br/><br/>An excellent 'small film', with a guaranteed Oscar nomination for Rourke and possible win.<br/><br/>9/10"
"Faith_Akin29","9","2","2","17 January 2009"," Rourke's big comeback
","Mickey Rourke, best known for his 1980's movies such as Diner and The Pope of Greenwich Village, 20 years later, after many obvious facial surgeries, has started a road back to stardom. The casting of Rourke in the Wrestler seemed a bit strange, only at first, but once you see the film, one is reminded once again of how great an actor Rourke really was, and still is. Nicholas Cage was supposed to play the role of Randy ""Ram"" Robinson, but due to budget issues, Aronofsky could not cast him. After seeing the movie, Cage called Aronofsky and told him that ""Rourke is the Ram."" He gained some muscle for the film and really looks the role of the beat down and washed up professional wrestler. You can read the emotions on his face and in his voice. It makes one feel for the character and reflect on those emotions throughout the film. The directing was superb and tailored to fit Rourke's performance, or perhaps the other way around... that's the beauty of it. A definite friendship between Aronofsky and Rourke was formed in this movie.<br/><br/>Aronofsky first made Pi in 1997, a black and white, daliesque, big ""math"" movie about a protagonist who is haunted by his own demons as he tries to solve the riddle of the stock market. In Requiem for a Dream (1999), an intense psycho-drama about many types of using addicts and the toll that it takes on their own lives, and the others around them. The ending to the film says it all. The Fountain in 2005 was more of a creative eternal love story seen through beautiful imagery, cgi, and acting. In his most recent, The Wrestler, he takes the old story of the ""comeback"" (completely paralleled through Rourke's real-life), and turns it into a beautiful, emotional, gut-wrenching film about the loss of hope, and regrets, turned into a seemingly strange redemption in the film's penultimate scene. The entire film is RAW and real. There is a scene toward's the end of the movie where Rourke's character is working as a deli-clerk in a supermarket. One of the customers recognizes him as The Wrestler and he begins to flip out, cutting himself on the meat slicer. Man, the stuff that Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson went through for his fans--- It's a sad drama, but a beautiful one. One that will probably win an Oscar for Rourke as best leading male actor. I highly recommend this film to anyone."
"pazu7","9","2","2","14 January 2009"," Gratitude for a classic
","This film doesn't really need any kudos from me since anyone who sees it will recognize it is destined to be a classic. But I was moved enough to add my own little BRAVO! and heartfelt gratitude to Mr. Rourke for a FLAWLESS performance, as well as Ms Tomei and Misters Aronosky and Siegal ... Mr Springsteen... hell, just everyone from the top down to the guy who cleaned the honey wagon! Thank you! This is what films are about, great performances and stories. No digital nonsense. No obtuse revelation at the end. I am reminded of 12 Angry Men, The War At Home, powerful dramas driven by powerful performances. Maybe I am gushing, but it's so wonderful to go to the theater and have such a satisfying viewing experience. There were two small moments when the pacing seemed off, and the expertly achieved documentary feel was compromised by what seemed a rushed bit of plot development: once when we meet Rourke's daughter for the first time and next when his Doctor gives him the bad news. And I thought the last encounter between Rourke and Tomei added an off note of predictability to the conclusion. But otherwise I think this was as close to perfection as I have seen. I am reminded of Taxi Driver for some reason. Not in content, but in the seamless construction of the film. One unexpected result of The Wrestler, for me anyway, was a new respect for pro wrestlers. Not that I am likely to become a fan, but in my dismissal of the field as phony, I have apparently neglected to recognize the artistry involved. There are many films I've yet to see this year, and there will surely be serious contenders for best actor, but I have a strong feeling Mickey Rourke's performance will take them all down for the count."
"fertilecelluloid","8","2","2","9 January 2009"," An emotional body slam
","The gorgeous Marisa Tomei gets her gear off yet again in ""The Wrestler"", an emotional body slam that amply displays both her acting and sexual charms. Her breasts, by crikey, are a monument to the gods. Even though she was hotter in ""Before The Devil Knows You're Dead"", she's still on the boil in this beauty, Mickey Rourke's very impressive comeback film. He was in ""Sin City"", of course, but he wasn't the lead in that one (not for the length of a feature, anyway). Here, he leads and we follow. The film could be about anything. It's mostly about a guy who's looking for self-redemption. He'd like to do a little emotional surgery on the frayed relationship with his estranged daughter, too, but that proves a very tricky grind. As does making things work with Tomei's wounded, heart-battered stripper. Rourke physically expresses his character with a body that resembles a torpedoed battle ship. His history oozes from his pores. Wrestling is painted as excruciatingly painful theater. Still a sport. But a sport mixed with bloody theatrics that can kill a man. The film's predictability is a minus, but the central performance is a massive, swaggering plus. Tomei is, as usual, a force of nature."
"Pierre_Kirby","9","2","2","29 December 2008"," The beauty of subtleness.
","I'm very shocked to learn that The Wrestler wasn't nominated for Best Picture of 08 at the Globes. What the hell were they thinking? They weren't even thinking! <br/><br/>I hate to be the one to give more hype to the film, but The Wrestler deserves every bit of praise it is receiving. Darren Aronofsky redefines himself by working on something that is yet again, unexpected, but goes in hand with his other work. In case you haven't noticed, in all of Darren's films, the main character(s) are on the verge of breakdown. What happens before and after doesn't matter, what matters is that Darren likes creating and/or working with individuals that have nothing (but ultimately everything) to lose. Same case with The Wrestler.<br/><br/>What moved me in this film is the unprecedented realism of it all, and not just from Mickey, but from everything and everyone in the film. This film feels like something made by Werner Herzog.<br/><br/>The realism and honesty of the performances is a sight to cherish. And let me start off by praising Mickey Rourke, who has given here what I believe to be the best performance of 2008. Honest and heartwarming- all hidden under the main character's broken down exterior that isn't afraid of reaching the limit. Mickey's method acting is at full force here, and the fact that his life is so similar to Ram's makes it easier for him to know the character better than anyone; up close and personal. There are so many subtleties and nuances in his performance that deserve being written, but I won't spoil the good stuff. <br/><br/>Mickey is accompanied by two very beautiful and talented women who also got snubbed by the Globes- Evan Rachel Wood and Marisa Tomei. As with Mickey, these ladies bring everything to the platter, i.e., they bring the goods, and not just physically (Tomeihrmph). Fantastic acting thanks to the talent at hand and Darren's direction.<br/><br/>As with his other films, the performance are those of quality; Darren knows how to work with actors- Ellen Burstyn, Marlon Wayans and Hugh Jackman being prime examples. The visual direction is outstanding, but not in the way you might think. It is outstanding in the realism it presents, not in its flashy editing or cinematography tricks like those in Darren's other films. Also, Darren's longtime friend and collaborator Clint Mansell, created a score (with Slash from G&R) that accompanies the film beautifully and personally. <br/><br/>The script is nuanced, but slightly predictable. That being said, this film wasn't trying to reach the stratosphere like other movies out there, it knew what it was and you should expect nothing more from that. A simple story about an aging Wrestler with personal problems that discovers his one true love, and embraces it, despite of its consequences. <br/><br/>Most people are missing the subtlety in the Wrestler. Seeing Mickey's face before he jumps off the top rope at the end of the film is one of the many examples. A single image backed up by powerful acting speaks volumes; it doesn't trick you, it tells it like it is. Nothing is thrown at your face here, you just have to find out the meaning for yourself.<br/><br/>9.3/10, powerful cinema."

","I love MR but he looks terrible, really bad like that woman who had plastic surgery to look like a cat (he should be fire his plastic surgeon), but the movie is very, very boring. If you have the mentality of a 12yo boy, the fake wrestling might appeal - I think it's garbage, but otherwise nothing happens. Maybe they were saving all of the interesting part of the story for the last 15 minutes, but it was so bad, after about 2 hours we just turned it off - and my wife ALWAYS watches a movie all the way through, but even she was bored. Remember, script writers: something interesting needs to happen sometime. Did he get abducted by aliens, turn to bank robbery, do something... anything? I'll never know, and after 2 hours, I certainly didn't care."

","Twenty years ago, Randy 'The Ram' Robinson (Mickey Rourke) was a successful wrestler; now he is decadent, living alone in a trailer, working part time in a supermarket and wrestling in the weekends. After a wrestling match, Randy has a heart attack in the dressing room and is submitted to a by-pass surgery; his doctor prohibits him to use steroids and wrestle again. Randy decides to retire and proposes the stripper and lap dancer Pam ""Cassidy"" (Marisa Tomei) to move to live with him. However she does not accept and suggests him to approach to his daughter Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood) that has deep wounds in her relationship with her father. Randy gets also a full-time job in the supermarket, but he does not deal well with the world outside the arena and decides to return to the sport were he is recognized by his fans.<br/><br/>""The Wrestler"" is a good, but overrated movie, with a drama that is very common with athletes when the end of their careers comes. Mickey Rourke returns like a phoenix in a role of a decadent wrestler that wasted his life and destroyed the relationship with his own daughter and has adaptation problems with the world outside the arena. The damage caused by the use of steroids should have been more emphasized to alert the youths that use this type of drug believing they are harmless. The gorgeous Marisa Tomei is also great and shows a magnificent body. Evan Rachel Wood has a minor but important role. My vote is seven.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""O Lutador"" (""The Fighter"")"

","this movie is so powerful and moving that it hit me in ways a lot of other films cease to do. Mickey Rourke (Sin City, Spun, Rumble Fish) really shows a powerhouse performance as Randy The Ram. a wrestler that was considered by a lot of people to be a wrestling legend. a force not to be reckoned with. but Randy The Ram suffers from a heart attack after a match and has to force retirement upon himself. so with him not fighting anymore he finds life very empty and tries to rekindle his relationship with his daughter (Evan Rachel Wood) and makes friends with a stripper (Marisa Tomei) and shows a lot of affection for her. you really feel the loneliness and sorrow for Randy as he tries to live life normally. the ending to this film is extremely powerful and upsetting.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky (Requiem For A Dream, The Fountain, Pi) is one of my favourite directors. he captures this movie brilliantly. the way he shot this film really brings out the gritty atmosphere. it looks almost like a documentary style film, don't let that fool you because it works brilliantly. the film received two Oscar nominations which i'm angry about. first of all the nominations were for Mickey Rourkes flawless acting which he should of won and best supporting actress for Marisa Tomei which i can understand if she didn't win but Mickey should of definitely won. now the really annoying thing is where was the nomination for best picture ??? or best director ??? they should of at least got nominated because this film is amazing (better than Slumdog Millionaire) i do like Slumdog but this film is better. well no point in going on but the academy really overlooked this masterpiece.<br/><br/>its awesome that this film is rated very high on IMDb with an 8.3 that places it at 119 in the top 250. the film deserves it. Mickey Rourke is with out a doubt the one and only guy who could of pulled off playing Randy The Ram. its one of the best performances i've seen in a while. i recommend this film to every one because its just a brilliant film that i think everyone will enjoy............. 10/10...........j.d Seaton"
"Chinchillajs","8","3","4","23 March 2009"," Who Says Wrestling's Fake??
","You're either one of three types of people: 1). You're the type who tune in from time to time and watch the WWE or/& TNA Wrestling when it's on TV (via a regular network) maybe because there's nothing on better. 2). You're the type who's a fan; from watching it religiously, to ordering their PPV's (Pay Per Views) and buying its merchandise. 3). You're the type of person who turns the channel whenever it comes on; you have no interest in watching it for whatever reason. Well I can honestly say that ""The Wrestler"" is something worth watching for whatever type you are.<br/><br/>The story is centered around (Randy 'The Ram' Robinson) an aging wrestler played convincingly by Mickey Rourke, whose career and body is whining down and he's trying to sort all his affairs as well as make peace with his estranged daughter (Stephanie Robinson) played by the beautiful Evan Rachel Wood. You'll also find the talented and diverse Marisa Tomei in this movie as somewhat of a reluctant love interest also at a crossroads in her life much like Mickey Rourke's character but in her case she's an aging stripper known as (Cassidy).<br/><br/>""The Wrestler"" was done in such a manner that though it was done for entertaining purposes you can't help but get a sense that it has a documentary feel to it. This ain't your Hulk Hogan's somewhat campy ""No Holds Barred"" from back in 1989, instead (Director) Darren Aronofsky and (Writer) Robert D. Siegel flip the script and give you brutal, honest, behind the scenes look at how wrestlers live their life for the moment for their fans whether it's at packed coliseums or an almost empty bingo hall. The movie shows that though the wrestling is rehearsed and the outcomes are predetermined, there's nothing fake about some of the risks they take like taking a shot to the head with a chair. Furthermore the movie not only goes into the lengths these entertainers/athletes go to for their fans in the ring but also what they subject themselves through on outside as well; some resorting to the use of steroids (or similar products) in order to stay and maintain their shape while others have to maintain a 9-5 job to pay for expenses/living since there's no money to be made unless you're on a large platform like a WWE or TNA.<br/><br/>(Spoiler Alert) My only Nock or Con on ""The Wrestler"" is in it's ending. After having sat through almost 2 hrs and finding myself completely caught up in the movie as well as it's characters... but later as the credits rolled I couldn't help but feel a bit cheated of an ending. Confused??Well then let me put it to you this way... it was ""The Sopranos"" all over again.<br/><br/>In conclusion ""The Wrestler"" was as good of a movie as they come minus the last fews seconds. Mickey Rourke was endearing and it sure was one of his best performances. I definitely enjoyed, would recommend and would watch it all over again. Wonder what'll be added to the DVD version. I hope this post was of some help and use. Enjoy."

","Thank you once again Darren Aronofsky for a fine movie. Fans of his films will not be let down with this simple story of a pro wrestler trying to sneak by through life doing what he loves. Though things are on a downward slide for this poor fellow he never gives up and continues to jump from the top rope. Some of the other characters aren't explored much such as his stripper friend and his long lost daughter, but really I didn't feel it necessary. I got choked up many times throughout the film and at the end couldn't hold back the tears. Tears for the character and for just how life is a struggle to just keep above water or find someone that cares about you. Jimi Hendrix sums it up the best when he says ""loneliness is such a drag"". AT least the Wrestler has his fans, which for him is all he needs."

","I find fascinating what people think it is fascinating....<br/><br/>Well, let's start with the positives. TW seems to be an interesting semi documentary about PART of the lives of pro-wrestlers; the depiction of fights in community centers for half-a-dozen spectators, just to make a few dollars must be very depressing and one really feel sorry for their lot. It is even possible to feel sympathy for the character played by Rourke, and that's all about it.<br/><br/>On the other hand, everything else in this movie has already been told countless times before. So, why is people raving about it? I really do not know. TW is about a guy down on his luck, no family, living in a trailer park, that has (it seems) a good heart trying his best to survive on a changing world, I guy that has seen better days.... Seems original? I don't think so.<br/><br/>Maria Tomei plays a stripper and that is all she does in TW; she shows her boobs and butt, nothing more, nothing less. Pretty cheap stuff. Her character adds nothing to the story.<br/><br/>Without the nudity and one sex scene, TW would be like one of these cheap movies they show in the Lifetime channel. <br/><br/>TW should be called ""The Clich√©'"". One even can foresee the climatic end of the movie."

","The guy is very talented. Pi & Requiem for a Dream were brilliant but made no money. The Fountain was solid but overly ambitious and lacked a Hollywood storyline thus lost about $25 million. The Wrestler is Darren paying back his Hollywood machers. Yes, it is well acted but the story of an aging burnout who can't let go of his past glory is the oldest story in the book. I found the depth lacking and overall it just plodded along until the ultimately clich√© ending. Just follow the numbers people - cost only $7 million and will probably gross about $20 - $30 million. This is Darren trying to remain viable in Hollywood and little else."
"tonysx","10","6","11","15 December 2008"," Simple, Brilliant, and Effective
","Randy 'The Ram' Robinson, played by Mickey Rourke, is an aging professional wrestler holding onto his last thread of fame and worthiness in the bottom ranks of the sport. His struggles however can be translated to most anyone who has passed their prime and can't quite let go. For Randy the only thing left in his life where he feels any sense of pride and meaning is in the ring. <br/><br/>The Ram was a superstar in the wrestling world 20 years ago. He performed in arenas for the championship belt of a top wrestling organization and when the film begins he is in an elementary school classroom recovering from a match. He is right back at the beginning only without the tools of his youth to build back up the ranks. He lives in a trailer and can't afford the rent, hasn't seen his daughter in years, and finds comfort in a stripper named Cassidy, played by Marissa Tomei. He makes money by working in a super market and wrestling small time local matches on weekends. Mickey Rourke is incredibly believable and genuine in his performance. He makes you care for this man when you probably shouldn't. Randy is a weak man who constantly crawls back to the only thing that has never let him down. When things get tough in the real world, Randy can always go to the ring where is still wanted, even if by a few fans who get a nostalgic kick out of seeing the old man take a fall. Rourke has innocence about him. I want to believe him and I want to believe that he has no other choice but is that necessarily true. Wrestling is the only thing he has known and it's living without the thrill of the match and the roar of the crowd that would be the real struggle in his life. That's the brilliance of the character and the performance.<br/><br/>Cassidy the stripper mirrors Randy in many ways. She is also passed her prime and battles through demeaning comments of young customers for a few bucks in tips. Like Randy, her best days were in the 80's when metal bands ruled and her body was in top form. She is shown entering her stage at the strip club in the same way Randy enters the ring. They are shot from behind as they stand behind a curtain and emerge as a character with their 80's rock music blasting. <br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky brilliantly strips down the flashy camera moves and powerful scores of his other films and simply shows this portion of this mans life. The power of the film is its simplicity. So much of what is said is not explicitly told by the filmmakers but subtly and effectively learned throughout the film. Aronofsky directs with an obvious confidence in the performances and the script. It's hard to articulate the strengths of the film without giving too much away about key scenes so I will leave it at this. The story of Randy 'The Ram' Robinson could be that of anyone in the wrestling business, or the professional sports business for that matter. It translates to the story of a stripper and even an aging actor. ""The Wrestler"" is one of the most effective films of the year because wrestling fan or not you can relate to these characters and genuinely feel for them."
"piverba","1","30","80","13 January 2009"," Passions of Mickey Rourke ¬ñ a vain exercise in S&M
","I am afraid but I have to dissent from the popular opinion and disagree with awards givers and most of the people so fervently complementing this film for veracity, poignancy, greatness of directorial and acting success. I strongly disagree with all these opinions.<br/><br/>The film is predictable, boring and suffers from bad taste. The situation of aged 'broken down piece of meat' wrestler is not typical, nor believable, neither interesting. It is a story of poorly lived life (not developed by the scenario) of contemporary gladiator. His life is paralleled with the life of a 'virtuous' stripper, who he intends for his sweat-heart. Do you know why most sympathetic characters in this sort of films (and there many of those) are always a drunkard, a prostitute, a drug addict? Do you know people like this? I do not! So where is the truth, the poignancy, do you wish to be like them, do you wish your children to be like them? Is this an example of who you do not to be?<br/><br/>The plot is also attempt to compare the wrestler's wounds with the passions of Christ. OK, if that was an intent then why it was not developed at all; just a statement or allusion to the fact does not make it meaningful - the situation is very contrived and unreal. More precisely, the film is about Mr. Rourke's passions as he correctly stated in a TV interview.<br/><br/>I do feel sorry for the great human material named Mickey Rourke, who was endowed by nature with great body, face, good deal of talent and who squandered it all, wasted in the orgy of drugs, violence and self-indulgence. I do hope that he will be able to remake and reinvent himself - but this is no reason, at least for me, to take part in his continuous Sado-Mazochism, evident in ""The Wrestler""."
"A_Minor_Blip","1","20","50","18 February 2009"," The Chump
","This is a meandering film that doesn't know what it is. For one instance it's very much like a documentary with the dizzy camera moving with each footstep, causing a viewer to be sea-sick. Certain side characters are documentary-like; as in, they aren't interesting, like people in movies, and seem somewhat realistic, i.e. mundane: this includes his boss, his opponents, his manager, and a little kid he befriends. But then there's his daughter, whose subplot provides melodrama the likes of a bad soap or, let's just say, a normal date movie. And his ""girlfriend"" stripper, who provides the film with a formulaic love story, seems out of place, and their relationship never seems right. This movie should have been more like the original ""Rocky"", and kept a fictional yet interesting feel throughout, with colorful characters we can be a part of, instead of walking the fence of realty show/fictional film. And the director should have kept the camera from moving so much. He had two shots: a far away shot where the camera isn't moving that seems like a security camera footage; and then everything else is shaky-cam: to the max. This film is overrated, big time. And the bar scene where the Wrestler and his stripper gal sing ""Round in Round"" is truly horrific."
"john-575","3","13","30","18 January 2009"," In a word... depressing
","I was looking forward to the Wrestler...the week before we tried to see it but the session time was misprinted in the paper so we switched to Slumdog Millionaire. The gods were smiling that day.<br/><br/>Yesterday we meant to see a preview of ""Grand Torino"" but that was running half an hour late so we opted for the Wrestler which started 3/4 hr earlier. The gods it seems with the value of hindsight were not smiling yesterday.<br/><br/>Honestly I thought I'd enjoy this movie.. true I do prefer happy endings. But the combination of self mutilation, the downward spiral in the Wrestlers life was all a bit too much. I was hoping once he got the job in the supermarket he'd get himself into a regular life and stay retired.. but sadly no.<br/><br/>Mickey Rourke cuts a fine figure of a man in the movie. Marisa Tomei does as well with a very hot bod. But ultimately New Jersey, trailer parks and the Wrestlers depressing life style were not for me.<br/><br/>With the value of hindsight I wished we'd left the theatre after the first 30 mins and gone to the one showing Gran Torino.<br/><br/>I think the comeback of Mickey Rourke and this movie in general have been over-hyped. To see it already well into the top 250 here... what can they be thinking? Basically the story here is just DEPRESSING."
"pschilling1","4","7","14","8 January 2009"," Mickey Rourke plays Mickey Rourke
","I honestly don't know what all the hype is. Sure Rourke can act. Most people that saw movies like 9 1/2 Weeks and Angel Heart already knew that. But this latest role wasn't much of a stretch... he plays a washed up, circus-type character in the movie that probably isn't too far off the mark in his own life of wrong decisions and abuse.<br/><br/>Rourke is seen here playing about the only character he can and still be taken seriously at after what he's done to his body and face. So, throughout the movie, when it's required of me to feel sorry for or root for this guy who is a washed up star, I'm lost between Rourke's character and Rourke himself. When I see a movie, I usually want to stay IN THE MOVIE.<br/><br/>In terms of a theme... I mean, yeah, it's sad - guy who was once successful realizes too late in life that his life has passed him by and he's left with a broken down body, a daughter who's disowned him, and without a real income. But do I feel sorry for the character who, even in the midst of realizing his life is over, still chooses a bar stool and sleeping out of the back of his van? There is no benefit for me to invest my faith into a character like this. They gave the character a good heart (only figuratively) and he's pleasant to people around him but I expect him to lose in the end and I don't care that he does.<br/><br/>He and Carrot Top should exchange numbers through their respective agents. Bet they'd have a lot to discuss in therapy together."
"orodruindrenden","10","5","9","20 May 2009"," Film worthy of the hype
","To get the perfunctory out of the way, yes the Rourke performance is everything it is hyped to be. His turn as Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson is outstanding, moving, and incredibly authentic. Marisa Tomei also does a terrific job and looks just wonderful.<br/><br/>That said, what makes this film so touching and affecting is the authenticity with which Aronofsky captures the life of a professional wrestler. What you see here is not the lifestyle of the current stars of the WWE. Rather, you see what becomes of the former superstars, as well as what the would be future stars of the sport have to endure. Rourke is a broken shell of the athlete he once was. Working 250 nights per year, many wrestlers wind up with painkiller addictions as they struggle to perform through the accumulation of minor injuries that build up during this grind. The overwhelming majority supplement their natural musculature with steroids. Rourke's character, we are to assume, has been abusing these drugs illegally for decades. For reasons like this, there is an unnaturally high rate of early deaths among professional wrestlers, many dying in their forties and fifties. Moreover, the fans of today's pro wrestling are all the more fanatical, not sated until they see someone attack another man with a folding chair, a fluorescent light bulb, or a staple gun.<br/><br/>Rourke's wrestler is in many ways a good man who has been broken by his career. Aronofsky does a brilliant job of immersing the viewer in the day to day life of Rourke's wrestler by his constant use of over the shoulder shots that follow our protagonist around. We see that in most cases the Ram makes good choices and lives a decent life. His only obvious failing is in his ability as a father.<br/><br/>In my honest opinion, the father/daughter storyline was added for dramatic grist for the mill. It is touching when their relationship seems to be blossoming, but it is derailed all too spectacularly and unrealistically climactically. (Sorry for the glut of adverbs there) The truly dramatic relationship in the film is between Rourke and Tomei, who has to struggle with her obvious sympathy and fondness for Rourke's character and her sense of professionalism, which she uses as a kind of barrier of legitimacy between herself and her profession. These two actors have a real sense of chemistry that is often lacking in popular film today.<br/><br/>In sum, I thought this movie was wonderful for a variety of reasons. The acting was absolutely top-notch. The dramatic narrative was enough for virtually anyone to identify with and support the protagonist. Further, as someone with intimate knowledge of the lifestyles of professional wrestlers who haven't made the big show, I appreciate the sympathetic, but more importantly realistic, depiction that the director has captured here. Absolutely fantastic film."

Fast forward to today, I just finished watching ""The Wrestler"" and as for my thoughts, wow!! this movie was really awesome.<br/><br/>I won't ruin this movie for anyone but the acting was very solid. The movie itself told a very realistic story of how wrestlers who were famous and considered by many past their prime still want to continue their legacy despite obstacles.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie even to a non-wrestling fan due to the fact that the movie is mostly analyzing what happens outside the ring.<br/><br/>Micky played his part perfect.

Marisa Tomei is wonderful in a low key, beautifully portrayed (but ultimately not credible) role, but the general dullness and predictability is not compensated by any character studies, narrative style, in-depth felt drama or even passably good fight scenes.

Well, The Wrestler is just that - except that there's more blood and tits than one is used to watching in these kinds of movies. An hour into the movie, restless, I kept saying ""Oh, just die already! DIE!"" I don't understand why it took TWENTY years for him to have that epiphanic moment where he figured out that this is it, this is all he is, he can't be anything else. Were there no prior clues to this? Was there no previous glimpse of his failing health? Did he never figure out that he had no one in his life - that he was all alone? I don't understand why this is just ANOTHER movie with strip club scenes. It's not a taboo or shocking subject piece in a movie anymore. It's not titillating to see Disease-Incarnate swaying used up limbs and booties. It's just not. The little respect I had for Tomei instantly disappeared after seeing her desperately shake her ass for the sake of ""acting."" This wasn't a pivotal role - it was a few lines and being naked. I love how Tomei discussed her role in The Wrestler and all the time she spent thinking and analyzing and critiquing the outfits she would wear. 'Hmmmm.... Rourke is supposed to put a dollar bill in my G-string according to the script, so I should wear a G-string and not Boy Shirts.' She's a smart one! I also thought that Evan Rachel Wood would have more screen time. She did really great - really emotional - but she wasn't on screen long enough!

Because he is also someone who was washed up in the 80s like Randy, and yet the exile from mainstream has been good for Rourke in a way, because now he is a man who pulls the pathos right out of you.<br/><br/>But the movie isn't only deserving of pathos, and neither is Randy ""The Ram"". The wrestling sequences made me wince and looked painful, Aronofsky has a gift for showing pain as I learned from watching ""Requiem For a Dream"". The blood looks real, and those that say professional wrestling is fake are only half right.<br/><br/>The movie is also sexy thanks to Marisa Tomei, playing a stripper who is growing out of the business, and is as connected to the 80s as Randy. Yet because of how far apart Randy has drifted from his daughter, Tomei's Cassidy is the closest to being a friend that Randy has.<br/><br/>Do I think this is the best movie I've seen this year? Yes. And if it isn't the best movie of this decade, it is definitely the most humanly real."

","A fading wrestling star (Mickey Rourke, perfectly cast) suffers a heart attack and must battle with being down and out in Sh*thole, New Jersey in Darren Aronofsky's gritty character piece, ""The Wrestler."" Message to Hollywood: there actually are nice places in Jersey...really...I'm not joking...trust me...but that's another story.<br/><br/>Aronofsky utilizes a self-consciously shaky camera and grainy cinematography to emphasize his depiction of a life literally on the ropes. For much of the film we are walking with the camera behind Rourke seeing everything from his point of view--another stylistic choice that may wear on some viewer's nerves while seem like a stroke of genius to others.<br/><br/>Admittedly I've never understood the appeal of pro wrestling, but I imagined it could be a decent vehicle for a character drama. Aronofsky delivers a mixed bag in this respect. Despite the expertly edited piece detailing the humorously brutal and tragic bout that leads to the aforementioned heart attack and the match that closes the film, the remainder of the wrestling bits are unnecessary and really add nothing to the story. The scenes in a shady gentleman's club (featuring a fabulously adept Marisa Tomei playing the over-the-hill but still hot stripper friend with a heart of gold) and the clips detailing Rourke's character's everyday struggles (including some great bits where he works a deli counter) are slightly more appealing and deliver some genuine moments. However, the scenes where he attempts to reconcile with his estranged daughter (an over-acting Evan Rachel Wood) seem staged and under-developed, which undermines the documentary style feel of the rest of the film. I won't deny I felt something for these characters, but haven't we seen this all before?<br/><br/>As finely tailored as Mickey Rourke is to his part, his is essentially a one-note character where we see him in varying stages of failure that lead him to believe the only place he can find acceptance is in the phony but dangerous world inside the ring. As good as Rourke and Tomei are, the script plays their story safe and succumbs to clich√©s. That being said, ""The Wrestler"" is still more engaging than your average Hollywood character study, and it's worth viewing for the occasionally authentic moment and the fine performances from Rourke and Tomei. But as Bruce Springsteen's theme song played over a black screen before the credits rolled, I couldn't help feeling sorry for Rourke and his character--and maybe that was the point. They try their hardest, but the film in which they appear isn't worth the hype."

This sado-masochistic mutilation and is deeply disturbing.<br/><br/>The rest of the film is also handled well. The two scenes at the butcher counter contrasts sharply with each other, powerfully providing an insight to Randy's mind. It is also refreshing to see emotional elements in an adrenaline packed film. The scene where Randy takes Stephanie to the seaside is great, as Mickey Rourke portrays his character's guilt and remorse brilliantly, thereby touching Stephanie's longing for a father who cares."

","Aranofsky drives me crazy. He understands film well enough to goof up expertly.<br/><br/>Sure, everyone will be impressed with how Rourke performs, and Tomie as well. But they are performers playing performers under a directing style that allows actors to run as wild as they wish. That could be useful if he had a long form film into which they could meld. But he ¬ó in all his films goes simply for a story that allows for the establishment of a tone and then he simply hammers the daylights out of it.<br/><br/>There's something worth arguing about though. He has this technique of anchoring the camera to his character, often by a tether. It is front, following, side, always with the body. Our Italian American filmmakers do something like this, except not so precise and consistent. It is from a specific philosophy of storytelling that has people defining the cosmos. I wonder how possible it is to make a successful, textured film with this approach. There simply cannot be enough flavor, sunshine, penetration in the mix.

","How low can you go ¬ñ and still tart something up enough to interest people with good taste?<br/><br/>The French make wonderful delicacies out of animal parts. Most people would grimace in the other direction while depositing such offal in the trash. Turner-Prize hopefuls have entered aesthetically arranged urinals ¬ñ and convinced us it is art. In the world of film, Trainspotting plumbed the depths of vomit, excrement and drug-taking ¬ñ yet it was hilarious. The Wrestler, on the other hand, is clever but just plain foul.<br/><br/>It's clever because it features an outstanding performance by Mickey Rourke more or less playing himself. And because of some clever analogies between vicious wrestling and seedy lap-dancing ¬ñ I kid you not. But it's still two hours of crowds lapping up grown men and women flogging their meat like animals. Rourke's character Randy cuts himself for the spectators, batters himself and opponents over the head with chairs and an artificial leg, and pumps his body with enough drugs to feed the whole of Colombia. Marisa Tomei as the lap-dancer with a heart of ¬ñ whatever the hearts of trailer-trash single mothers are made out of ¬ñ struts her stuff in front of abusive audiences. At one point she bends over and I am in serious doubt as to whether any dental floss still covers the space between her lower molars. I needn't have worried. The camera obligingly repeats the shot a few seconds later. Randy spam-for-brains has an emotional side. We are supposed to feel touched the way we might if an aunt with Alzheimer's lovingly made beef stew with dog-meat. So throw in a long-lost daughter who has had the good sense to tell Randy to f-off. Randy cries. He makes half-hearted attempts to win her back. Poor sod. A heart-attack momentarily jingle-jangles his single brain cell into thinking he should get a life. But a scene with him serving at a deli counter is woefully underdeveloped even if it's the best bit in the movie. Randy is, however, a believable individual. Tomei's storyline is a little less credible, even with superlative acting. Momentarily trying to transform herself into a Real Person and return the affection of Mr Meat-Paws runs counter to the background already created for her character. Both of them, having lived a life of falsehood, wonder what it would be like to come to terms with who they are.<br/><br/>But don't expect any happy endings from Mr Requiem-for-a-Dream Aronofsky. This is a director who has 20/20 vision to see art in a lump of poo. He is so totally not going to let you off the hook. Since he has obvious talent, one wishfully wonders how he might broaden his horizons. Say, to something inspiring, entertaining or mildly informative. <br/><br/>I have no objection to portraying violence, degradation, and even graphic sexuality more explicit than a coal-miner's w*nk-fantasy. Which is more than you get here. For instance, Hunger, a violent (and even more realistic) film about the Maze Prison, had uplifting themes of human courage. The gynaecological explicitness of Breillat's films questions our understanding of sex in real terms. Even Emmanuelle could break up a long night of boredom. But the Wrestler satisfies neither one camp nor the other. It doesn't, for instance, show us the mistakes he made for his slide into the Dumb Hulk. (A biopic of Mickey Rourke's real life would have been infinitely more interesting.)<br/><br/>Arofnofsky has let go of his artistic pretensions that at least started so well in Requiem for a Dream. After people found his next movie, The Fountain, too obscure, I think he maybe just gave up. Instead of admitting that artistic freedom involves mistakes and close calls, he has tried to make a mainstream hit. Unfortunately, the Wrestler has none of the greatness that made Rocky so memorable. It has none of the entertainment flair that made even Flashdance so watchable. And if you take your significant other to watch it, you may feel seriously embarrassed in the process.<br/><br/>The Wrestler will have its fans. People who rightly proclaim its realism (storyline excepted). Or are so swayed by Rourke's performance that they find the film more than bearable. And if you can no longer get your video of dog-fights with your under-the-counter porn, maybe this is just the movie for you."
"moonspinner55","5","5","10","2 May 2009"," Appropriately squalid, yet thin and predictable character study does provide Rourke with a flashy acting showcase...
","Mickey Rourke appears to connect strongly and sincerely with this role, as Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson, a professional wrestler 20 years passed his peak; it's the kind of searing, heartfelt performance only a true survivor could deliver. Now working the warehouse in a supermarket and hanging out at a local strip club, Randy does wrestling gigs on the weekend for little money and hopes to reunite with his estranged daughter. Director Darren Aronofsky and screenwriter Robert D. Siegel keep the melodramatics at bay while following Randy through his days (the camera usually tracking just behind him, an idea which grows visually tiresome). Aronofsky's details are uncannily right, and one can almost sense the perspiration (and desperation) in the air at Randy's matches, yet the film's squalid milieu and atmosphere can't build momentum. There are commendably no phony overtures to dramatic 'truths', but neither is there much happening to absorb us. Rourke is almost irresistible while wearing a cheap hearing aid, his glasses perched on the end of his nose, and his portrayal has the ring of truth an intimate character study like this requires. Marisa Tomei's work as a stripper who's afraid of getting close is far less substantial (she's not integral to the story), and Evan Rachel Wood's portrayal of the embittered daughter doesn't work small miracles either (both actresses are solid without being genuinely moving). Randy has buddies and acquaintances, but no friends (not even a pet), and we don't get many details about his background (the mother of his child is never mentioned). We watch him from a distance as he attempts to sort out his life little by little. Rourke's confused, conflicted presence (like a downtrodden Incredible Hulk) does bring us closer to this man, but even his work can't save the film from a series of predictable incidents and one bummer of an ending. ** from ****"

The first third of this ugly movie wallows in the atrocities of wrestling, with revolting scenes of flesh wounds and bloodletting. It gets better as the focus shifts out of the ring, but clich√©s abound. Rourke is surprisingly good, providing a sympathetic portrait of a loser. Tomei is also good as an aging stripper. Aronofsky is so obsessed with the back of Rourke's head that about a quarter of the film is devoted to a hand-held camera following Rourke from behind as he walks around.

"mckehev","10","3","5","15 March 2009"," Manly movie that truly delivers
","What an amazing movie! Will definitely get myself a copy as soon as it comes out to watch it again and again during lonesome October nights and cry, cry, cry. I feel kind of bad for the lovely lady Marisa Tomei ¬ñ she is way, way too good of an actress to spend such a significant portion of her time on the screen naked. Don't tell me it was justified by the fact that her character is a stripper, there are tons of movies where you don't even get to see boobs of a, supposedly, stripper character and here you get to see her from the points of view and in positions that her husband gets to see either after giving her the most ridiculously expensive gifts or in this movie. Still, God, gym and dance instructors, and plastic surgeons, please, help more women in their 45 to have bodies and striptease skills similar to the ones of Marisa Tomei ¬ñ that would definitely make this world a better place! Getting back to the topic, I see a twofold motivation for such an explicit and extensive nudity. First, it makes a movie slightly more artsy and independent. Second, it makes a movie significantly manlier. The truth is - this movie doesn't need such a cheap trick to get some additional manliness; it easily surpasses the theoretical manliness upper bound without it. Mainly, due to the script. No, Mickey Rourke is incredible and perfect for this part, but, guys, the script is oh so bold, vivid and original. I swear God you would never ever guess what really happens in this movie and how it actually ends from its touching but pretty clich√© trailer! You would be so very surprised! I wish I could tell you what the script is all about right here but I really don't want to spoil your pleasure. I'll just tell you that it's, obviously, about being a real man as well as about an amazing effort to change followed by spectacular dignity, but those are absolutely not the clich√© change and dignity you just thought about! Here's one more thing and in this one most of you probably won't agree with me - I really think that this script ends with a happy end; I was applauding to the man in my mind continuously throughout the movie, especially so at the end and even though it made me cry like a baby it made me happy and proud for the man at the same time."
"Argemaluco","10","3","5","3 March 2009"," A truly perfect film
","The Wrestler is an extraordinary film at the same time it marks the transition of director Darren Aronofsky to a different style than the one of his previous movies.The Wrestler is a more accessible film than Aronofsky's previous movies.Pi,Requiem for a Dream and The Fountain were very unusual movies while The Wrestler is more ""normal"".But this very talented director has made a brilliant work even at a style which is different than the one he is accustomed to.This is a magnificent movie which will stay with the spectator for a long time (well,that's what happened in my case).Basically,The Wrestler repeats the formula from Rocky (or,more precisely,from Rocky Balboa).But putting the main character in the wrestling world makes the story more credible and less archetypal.The down at heel hero who tries to recover his previous glory has been used on many movies; but in The Wrestler,that story feels fresh,unpredictable and absolutely realistic because of some innovative angles the screenplay has.Many people consider The Wrestler as the artistic rebirth of Mickey Rourke,which makes me very happy,although we do not have to underrate his solid works on supporting roles in movies like Domino,Spun and the brilliant Sin City.But the last time we had seen Rourke in a leading role was in 1992,in the movie White Sands.His performance in The Wrestler is monumental and it also helps the fact that Rourke had a period of glory for then living in the shadows for a long time,something which is related to his character.Marisa Tomei also shines on her character because she is completely natural on her role.Evan Rachel Wood also brings an excellent performance because she shows solid range and adequate deepness.Aronofsky's direction is perfect.The style he found to tell the story was completely appropriate,he could obtain magnificent performances from his cast and the scenes of wrestling fights are very well filmed.The screenplay is amazing,not only because it is very well crafted and because it presents a perfect development of the characters,but also because I admired the way in which it shows the wrestling world.For one sight,it accepts the falseness from that sport but for the other sight,it shows the tremendous training the wrestlers have to do,which requires enormous effort.And I also liked the ending very much.I think it should not be taken on a literal way,but as an analogy of the emotional search of the main character.I will not say any more because I would ruin the movie to the reader.The Wrestler is a magnificent and absolutely fascinating movie which shows once more,why Aronofsky is one of the most interesting contemporary directors.This is a great cinematographic experience which deserves all the acclamation it has received.Besides,who cares if Rourke did not win the Oscar ? What it matters is that this excellent actor made an extraordinary work,at the same time he recovered the dignity as an actor many people considered it was lost...and that means much more than a whimsical trophy which has a very doubtful credibility."
"EUyeshima","8","3","5","30 December 2008"," Take a Ringside Seat for Rourke's Galvanizing Comeback
","It's hard to imagine any actor but the thoroughly embattled Mickey Rourke in the title role of this unremittingly bleak 2008 character study of a pro wrestling star well past his prime and trying to figure out if he can have a life outside the ring. Unlike the heavily stylized work for which he is known (""Pi"", ""Requiem for a Dream""), director Darren Aronofsky takes a refreshingly straightforward approach here, and Roarke responds with a galvanizing performance that appears to blur the line between reality and fiction. A talented actor (""Sin City"") with a tattered career of early highs and all-too-many lows, much of them his own doing, he has such a firm grasp on his character's fatal flaws one can't help wondering how much art is imitating life. Regardless, the symbiotic result makes for an often powerful film-watching experience.<br/><br/>Rourke plays blond-maned Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson whose professional glory peaked back in the 1980's. Two decades later, he finds his career relegated to small-time matches on the independent circuit in venues attended by only the most fanatical of his diminishing fan base. Living in a trailer he can barely afford, Randy lives on the edge of life, using a pharmacy of meds to hold his broken body together and going to a strip club where he finds himself drawn to a veteran lap dancer named Cassidy. Even in such desperate straits, he proves to be a decent man wracked with not only physical pain but a foreboding sense of his own mortality once he is hospitalized after a grueling match. The story focuses on his fumbling attempts to come to terms with what he wants from what's left of his life.<br/><br/>That includes reconciling with his long-estranged daughter Stephanie who has grown bitter over years of being ignored, forming a lasting relationship with Cassidy beyond the next sixty dollars, and even quitting the ring entirely by working the deli counter at a local grocery store. However, the draw of a twentieth anniversary rematch with another iconic wrestler, the Ayatollah, pulls hard at him with the dream of recapturing his former glory. The storyline sounds predictable, and it is if you just take into account Robert Siegel's bare-bones screenplay, but it falls on Rourke's deeply felt work to thwart the clich√©s. Only allowed to show the character in terms of his succession of failures, the actor brings aching heart and surprising sensitivity to a role that could have easily been mired in stereotype. His confessional at the deserted amusement park is heartbreaking.<br/><br/>At the same time, with his physique made to look ravaged by steroids and ringside abuse, he is completely convincing in the ring as he orchestrates the elaborate moves to give his fans their money's worth. As the self-protective Cassidy, Marisa Tomei (""Before the Devil Knows You're Dead"") again proves what a fine, underrated character actress she can be as her character uneasily keeps Randy at arm's length when his need for intimacy threatens her insulated world. Evan Rachel Wood (""Across the Universe"") has less to do as Stephanie, but she punctuates her scenes with both visceral anger and poignant wariness. The film has an almost documentary feel about it thanks to Aronofsky's no-frills direction and Maryse Alberti's washed-out cinematography, but the approach is fitting given the gritty subject."

He writes things that take away from the overall movie watching experience... and he's a douche.)<br/><br/>This movie was well acted, as everyone has written a million times. Mickey Rourke's entire career arch happened so he could play a role like this in his advanced years. I'm typically not a fan of Aronofsky (nor do I care if that is spelled correctly).

Being from Jersey I feel as though he really captures all the nooks and crannies that give the state it's character as he does the with Rourke and Tomei. This film showed a lot of restraint and never took a sappy turn that a Clint Eastwood directed film may have. Kudos on that, Aronofsky.<br/><br/>Oddly this movie is a lot like Rocky Balboa in it's subject matter (ie: it's main character). It sounds absurd but I feel like this is the grittier more realistic little brother of that movie. It hits on similar plot points and similar emotional notes.

","The roar of the crowd is something that pro wrestler Randy ""the Ram"" craves, but decades past his prime, it is not nearly enough to pay the bills. Evicted from a trailer home, working long hours at a grocery deli counter, alienated from relatives and addicted to expensive and lethal cocktails of synthetic hormones, pain killers, alcohol and blow, Randy has one foot in the grave. When the inevitable heart attack finally comes, the Ram is warned to avoid any strenuous activity. Remarkably, Randy takes in stride what to him should be a death sentence. He sets his mind up to make amends with his estranged daughter, woo the woman of his dreams (a kind-hearted stripper in denial), and give up the sport he loves. As the Ram, Randy endures severe beatings, razor blade cuts and staple gun wounds all over his body, among lesser evils, but the real world just might be tougher than this.<br/><br/>A killer story, career-resurrecting performance by Mickey Rourke, and amazing support by Marisa Tomei (Randy's love interest), help make this film one of the most beloved sports films of all time. What happens to the Ram is as heartwarming as it is heartbreaking, for Randy is charming and likeable even as he wallows in well-deserved pain and ignominy. The film is colorful and beautiful in form, it flows well from one scene to the next, and each of the characters is recognizable, relevant, balanced, unpredictable and, unlike many sports films, closer to the all too human truth."

Rourke portrays an aging wrestler who struggles with his life as he is faced with retiring. Rourke looks like a man who has been beaten up by life and in the ring so he fit the character perfectly and along with fantastic performances from Marissa Tomei and Evan Rachel Wood who play his stripper love interest and estranged daughter respectively. What this mix brings is a wonderful story that is more about the struggles of life than it is about sport and is another film that makes you feel all sorts of feels if you have emotions like a normal person, but if you're like me it is just a real good film.

","This is a story of an old timer professional wrestler, once globally known and respected, whose prime time has passed and now makes a living by performing in local matches and working at a supermarket. After one of his matches he fells unconscious due to a heart attack and after being treated at a hospital, he is told that he can no longer wrestle because his heart can fail again and he may not survive this time. He decides to set wrestling aside as prescribed. This is very tough for him both emotionally and economically as this has been his life long passion. So, he tries to make up for it by finding love in family and human affection. There are two people in his life who he feels passionate toward. Firstly, it is his daughter, Stephanie, whom he left when she was very young and she sort of hates his father. Second, there is this stripper, pam, who has Ram as a regular customer and Ram has grown some affection for her beyond the sex dances she gives him at the joint. Unfortunately for Ram, neither of these two reciprocate the passion he feels. His daughter, while mad at him at first for neglecting him all this time, warms up to him due to his persistent and humorous personality. However, Ram misses an important dinner with her which makes her end their relationship for good. Pam, on the other hand, is hesitant about Ram as her love goes mostly to her nine year old son whom she is devoted to. While it is clear that Pam sees Ram as more than a mere customer she is hesitant to start an affair and thus ignores Rams efforts to establish one. This culminates in a fight in the strip club which convinces Ram not to pursue her anymore. Now, Ram is at the end of the line. He has lost his lifetime joy. His daughter which is his only family hates him. The only woman in his life has turned him down and the one time glamorous wrestler have to sell dellys at a local supermarket to makes end meet. This is the final moment for him and he decides to die a glorious death, pursuing what he loved most in life, the wrestling. So he decides to wrestle one more time knowing that this would be his last. The end of the movie is open to debate. It does not show him die. So, he might survive this fight. Even though I believe his leap at the end is the leap to his death and he indeed dies. But, what else can be implicated is that he decides to wrestle at the cost of his life and he will definitely die sooner or later in one of the matches.<br/><br/>Compared to the other Arnofsky's movie, the black swan, I did not like this movie that much. First of all, I could not feel the passion that the director intended me to towards Ram. I did not feel sorry for him when his daughter left him. In fact, I think he deserved it. When her daughter was awaiting him in the restaurant, he was drinking bear, smoking drugs, and banging a chick at a bar! Apparently, he is a careless person and he does not love his daughter that much. On the other hand, I can not understand why Pam refused him so persistently. Pam is a stripper at the end of her career and a supportive husband and father for her kid will be desirable for her as she plans to start a new life somewhere else. If she would have doubted faithfulness and trustworthiness of Ram that would have made sense. But she keeps telling him that he is a customer and she could not have relationships with customers. Why she cares so much about that when she is going to leave the joint soon anyways? It seems that Pam also feels for Ram somehow but she is doubtful of it (for the reasons that are missing!). This specially shows near the end when she leaves the club to go to and change Rams mind for the wrestle/suicide. However, it is not clear to me if she does this on a humanitarian basis or she has some feelings for Ram. When she catches Ram before his match, she mentions that she is gonna be there so this means sort of like a positive answer to Rams love. However, it is too late and Ram has decided his fate. Knowing what is going to happen, Pam can not watch the match and leaves. The scene that Ram rejects Pams offer to stay together also does not make sense. Ram could have called off the match (at the cost of angering the organizers) and left with Pam. This was what he was looking for after all. Before his final leap of death, Rams looks again at the place were Pam used to stand for a final goodbye and gets disappointed when he couldn't find her. I just can not understand why he refused Pam before the match. The only reason I can think of is that he felt her reaction was out of feeling sorry for him and not a true love. For these reasons and gaps, I didn't like the movie that much. Also, I didn't feel Mickey Rourke deserved an Oscar. He wasn't that impressive to me. In addition, there are not many memorable events in the movie.<br/><br/>At last, I should say that all the fuss that Iranian media made out of the movie did not make sense. I am an Iranian and I did not feel even a bit offended by the wrestler called ayatollah. Sometimes, Iranian media just become over-fussy over unimportant stuff. This is one of these cases."

","If ever a guy deserved an Oscar it is Mickey Rourke for his portrayal of Randy ( The Ram ) Robinson in this film. I believe he lost out to Sean Penn who played some gay guy no one cares about in the film Milk? Marisa Tomei also does an excellent job as a really believable lap dancer, she works well as both the sleazy stripper and hard working mom. For me she had the perfect mix of glamour and ordinariness to pull this off.<br/><br/>But it is really Mickey Rourke who steals the film with more realism than any film of this genre I can think of. Not even Stallones Rocky comes this close to accurately portraying such a sad character who is top of his field but sliding into obscurity or even near death.<br/><br/>Evan Rachel Wood also does a great job as his estranged daughter and the scenes between her and her Dad ( Randy ) are some of the most moving in the film.<br/><br/>Bear in mind that this is NOT a family film and contains some pretty adult scenes ( both violent and sexual ) but what really makes this film so good is Mickey Rourke's superb acting. For me he was robbed of the Oscar for sure. Fortunately Mickey Rourke won a BAFTA"

"Ziya90","10","2","3","2 January 2010"," Hated, because unconventional?
","I have realized that many people don't like unconventional movies. The Wrestler is an example of this like No Country for Old Men. Despite, it is in IMDb Top 250, some comments or posts in the forums proves that, people say very hard, even nasty things, there are a lot of people who say that they hated it. The Wrestler was a very flowing film to me, the time flies by. By the way, the background music was great, probably one of the most coherent musics with the content ever made. Some people say that nothing happens in the movie. Many things happen, but it just does not excite those people's interest. The extreme wrestling scene in the middle of the movie must be mentioned. High adrenalin. At the same time very sad. I suppose that some get bored of hearing Mickey Rourke's name like he came back etc. However, he really deserves, his performance is to me one of the best performances of all time. And I did not see Milk, but probably I would have given the Oscar to Rourke. The Wrestler is not a great movie only so that Rourke's performance is great. The shots in Aranofsky's previous movies were too short, sometimes so exhausting, in this movie, it seems that he changed his style. The habits of the directors do not change, but he did. Otherwise, for such a movie, such a content, his style would be inappropriate which means a disappointing movie. The Wrestler is a very still movie. Throughout the movie, in some scenes, we see Rourke's back, the camera follows him. It did not annoy me, it was interesting, but probably the director did not do that to make the movie interesting, to get us feel watching a documentary, so it looks natural also. Marisa Tomei's character is clich√©, but very realistic, her performance contributes to this realism too. Mickey Rourke's this character was very interesting, colorful and striking, he (or his character) makes the movie much more appealing. It was also a very realistic and deep character study. He is not as tough as he is in the ring. He uses his strength only in the rings. He is a little bit meek in daily life, very patient, he does not get angry easily. May be, he roars when necessary. I felt like having a heart attack when he has. I loved the scene take place in the super market. By the way, the whole movie is very consistent in terms of story telling and very stylish direction. The only weak point of the movie is the final. As an audience who satisfied with the final of even Old Men, this did not make me satisfied. It was too indistinct, so prepare yourself, but ultimately welcome. Even if The Wrestler is not excellent because of this, it is one of my all time favorite movies."

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>Randy 'The Ram' Robinson (Mickey Rourke) was a 1980s wrestling phenomenon, but years later he's a washed up has been who does the odd bit of wrestling here and there to a select crowd only. Estranged from Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood) the daughter he was never there for, a sudden heart problem causes him to reassess his life and get back in touch with her, as well as try and get a relationship going with similarly past her prime stripper Cassidy (Marisa Tomei.) But when the opportunity for a major comeback match beckons, he's torn between the only thing he's ever been any good at and the personal life he's made such a mess of.<br/><br/>Everyone over the age of eleven knows wrestling is staged and fake. Beefed up muscle men inflicting cartoonishly painful attacks and seeming torture on each other, as well as a lack of any genuinely competitive element or rules you can't break. Nevertheless, it has a world wide network of die-hard fans that annually pack out arenas and stadiums, making it a global enterprise in itself, so it's detractors have a large slice of humble pie to chew on. But, like many other 'sports', there is a definite chew them up and spit them out mentality to it, with stories of steroid abuse, backstage corruption and former champions going off the rails when they become past their prime. And in an almost semi autobiographical way, Mickey Rourke here perfectly brings to life a grizzled has been, whose isolated, pathetic existence is quite at odds with the high life he must have once enjoyed. You get the real feel of what it must feel like to have climbed so high and fallen so hard. Still, Randy's a fu*k up with a heart of gold you just can't help but love, a hard bitten, wise cracking tough guy whose spirit never manages to truly dampen in spite of relations in his personal life crashing down around him like Rome. The lack of a woman in his life is something he tries to resolve by starting to get something going with Cassidy (Tomei.) Although she's reluctant because dating a customer is a line she doesn't want to cross, she's in denial to the obvious attraction to Randy, in the sense they're both ageing has beens who can't cope with life without an audience, the one thing they both make a better job of than what's going on around them.<br/><br/>'Acclaimed' director Darren Aronofsky has taken an unlikely subject matter and turned it into one of the most surprising and sensitive offerings of recent times. There's not much I can say that others already have, but this deservedly put Rourke back in the spotlight and wrongly failed to win any awards. *****"

","Since my childhood days,I always interested in Professional Wrestling. A Private channel in my country was showing old school WWF(It wasn't called as WWE in those years of course) matches and despite the matches were being shown late at the night I was still watching them.And I liked them. I still do. For the memories that I have about Professional Wrestling, when I heard this movie, it made me so excited. But I was expecting a elevated action package with a lot of cool wrestling action. After Watched the movie, I've understood how I was wrong! This movie isn't about ""entertainment"" part of the Wrestling, but It's about wrestlers themselves. It tells you that what is happening when the lights have been shut down and wrestlers get back to their ordinary life. Movie, especially emphasis on Pro Wrestler Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson's life both in/outside of the ring. His relationship with his daughter,his bread and butter,and others wrestler's behaviors towards Rany, all of these are given with such a emotional language that it's impossible not to communion with characters(Especially with Randy).I didn't surprise when I've learned from trivia part that Roddy Piper cried after watched The Wrestler, because I also felt the same things. The Wrestler is such a internally, cordial movie that you might want to embrace it with teardrops as if it's a human."
"michuk","9","2","3","5 April 2009"," The Last Ram Jam
","After watching 'The Wrestler' I can safely assume that Darren Aronofsky is capable of making an Oscar-winning movie about daily tasks of an office clerk. The screenplay of the latest film of the director of ""Requiem for a Dream"" is simple and unsurprising. But it's not the screenplay that matters in Aronofsky's movies. It's only a minor part of the art of cinema for him. What matter is getting into human beings, feeling their emotion. And this, again, worked amazingly well.<br/><br/>Randy 'The Ram' (Rourke) is an aging wrestler, a former star of the great American invention mistakenly called there ""wrestling"", which actually has more to do with acting than wrestling and can be summed up as ""trying to imitate a cruel fight using hands, legs and different sharp artifacts"". Despite his age and significant health problems, he's determined to have his ""last fight"" that -- as he hopes -- will get him back to the top.<br/><br/>This is however only a dream. In reality his days of fame have passed long time ago and Randy makes a living trying random physical job, and spending his weekends fighting in a local wrestling club, usually with wrestlers that could be his sons or grandsons. And the nights... He spends them mainly in a local night club where he gets involved in a sort-of-relationship with an aging stripper (Tomei). And this relationship together with desperate attempts to get back daughter's trust (the daughter for whom he didn't care for over 15 years) make the movie.<br/><br/>But as I wrote before, the plot is not crucial in Wrestler. somewhere I read that this film was supposed to be ""an attempt to draw attention to the how America treats its former stars"". Frankly, I would not find that interesting and I do not think anyone really cares. Fortunately, Aronofsky is distant from those kinds of deep topics, and chooses to rather focus on the main character, the wrestler, on his awkwardness, helplessness and his fight, his constant fight to get out of his magnificent past and start a new life. And this focus is the strength of the movie.<br/><br/>It's very naturalistic in showing the preparation for fights, cleaning the body, removing strange artifacts and blood afterwards. It's touching in the way it shows his every-day life: a scene when playing an old Nintento game with neighbor's kid (wrestling of course), casual sex with a narcotized girl remembering his previous fame. All those activities do not allow him to forget who he is... or who he was.<br/><br/>A separate paragraph should be devoted to Rourke alone. His role was simply so natural, so realistic that it just felt that 'The Ram' is himself, that he's not acting. Because... how on Earth could we justify the fact that simple and pretty conventional scene of saying ""I'm sorry"" to his daughter is one of the most powerful and touching ones in the whole movie? How on Earth other that -- it just feels real.<br/><br/>Thanks to the great Rourke and fantastic climax building using music, sound, cinematography and ""this something"" added by Aronofsky, ""The Wrestler"" is a powerful and engaging movie that I watched with my jaws dropped up until the final ""Ram Jam"".<br/><br/>// This review has been originally published at http://filmaster.com -- film buffs community //"

Sadly, lead actor-Mickey Rourke was not acting but in character and unfortunately I do not foresee a brilliant comeback for a once great talent.<br/><br/>This movie has the 'Adrian' component but it lacks an important riveting, interesting supporting cast member such as 'Paulie' or 'Mickey' and that is why this reader/writer was disappointed with this feature."

"mattwaterhouse","10","2","3","2 March 2009"," Oscar worthy
","I don't cry in movies. Don't get me wrong, I'm not heartless, I just don't. There were points in this film where I had very real tears in my eyes.<br/><br/>Mickey Rourke is Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson (the wrestler of the title), who lives in the nostalgia of his former glory but who's career has taken a nosedive. After a match he suffers a near fatal heart attack, and facing the reality that he can no longer do what he loves, he tries to face living in the real world.<br/><br/>I have not seen many films by Darren Aronofsky, but after seeing this I really want to. The direction is sublime, the writing smart and subtle and the editing highly commendable. In particular, in the scene where The Ram starts working in a new job, the sound of a crowd cheering is edited in as he walks towards the entrance. Also, the final shot of this movie took my breath away. Its amazing.<br/><br/>It is clear that Aronofsky can get the best out of his actors. Most of the cast are unknowns, I only recognised three of the names in the credits. This gives the film a sense of reality, and also gives the leads a chance to improvise and banter. The wrestlers are all real wrestlers, and they have some great dialogue with Mickey Rourke. The people who stand out though are Evan Rachel Wood and Marisa Tomei. Wood only has maybe 3 or 4 scenes, but uses the time well, both brutally and in a way that breaks your heart. Tomei's character delivers brilliant dialogue and is a fantastic mirror for The Ram, as an ageing stripper holding on to her profession even though she rarely has custom.<br/><br/>Now, Mickey Rourke. This guy is a very good actor, but this is his best role by a long shot. I dare say the best performance by a leading man this year. He delivers genuine emotion and brilliant range in his portrayal of a man who cannot let go of what he is best at, and what he loves. He had this character down to a T and I really hope this movie re-energises his career, because goodness knows he deserves it.<br/><br/>The best compliment I can give is this; despite the subject matter and the issues raised, this never lapses into melodrama. It remains subtle and heartbreaking to the last, and I can only give praise."
"varundelpiero","8","2","3","17 February 2009"," Excellent character study with strong acting, and an interesting story...
","Darren Aronofsky's fourth film as director is not nearly as strange or unorthodox as his previous three, but is more straightforward, and is dependent on the story and the main character rather than atmosphere. THE WRESTLER is all about Mickey Rourke, who gives the best performance of an otherwise mediocre career. It is a performance worthy of a Best Lead Actor nomination, perhaps not a victory. Rourke portrays the aging wrestler who has lost touch with almost all humanity. He works a dead-end day job, and struggles to make the rent. All his money is spent on performance enhancers, legal and illegal. His only daughter has disowned him and his only meaningful relationship is with a stripper who is also nearing the end of her career. His other 'real' relationship is with his hordes of bloodthirsty fans.<br/><br/>Rourke does not take the easy way out, playing the role with melodrama, or begging the audience for pity and sympathy. Instead, he is a proud man, disconnected form humanity, cut off from the rest of the world. All he knows is wrestling.<br/><br/>The film goes to some length to give a behind-the-scenes view of mainstream wrestling. As most people are aware of by now, much of the violence is simulated and exaggerated, and most of the fight is scripted. I have long stopped watching (about 10 years now), abandoning the violent soap opera that calls itself professional wrestling.<br/><br/>Much must also be said about a smoking hot Marisa Tomei, who is perhaps reason enough to watch the film, not only for the obvious visceral pleasure, but for the intelligent way she portrays her character. Her nomination for Best Supporting Actress was well-deserved.<br/><br/>THE WRESTLER is a fine Motion Picture. It is still a bit strange to see Aronofsky take the straightforward route, but to his credit, it works in his favour. 8/10. 3.5 stars (out of 4). Should enter my top 200 at 173. Highly recommended."
"isabelle1955","Null","2","3","10 February 2009"," Watch it for Rourke and Tomei
","There is really only one reason to go watch The Wrestler, and that's to see Mickey Rourke's screen comeback as Randy 'The Ram"" Robinson. I can remember almost nothing of his earlier career but his return has certainly elicited acres of press coverage, and I was curious to know what all the fuss was about. I also have to admit a certain grudging admiration for anyone who can put himself through the kind of physical torture that I suspect making this movie must have been.<br/><br/>There is nothing especially profound to be gleaned from this movie. Don't expect a damning critique on the morality of sadomasochistic wrestling as entertainment. The story isn't terribly original, nonetheless it is done well, given the limits of the genre. It's unpretentious entertainment. Old pro wrestler, down on his luck and surviving on past fame, tries for one last big comeback. His life contains various trashed relationships - including a daughter who doesn't want to know him because he's been a lousy father - and he patches himself up physically with copious amounts of steroids, cocaine, a fake tan and rather enviable blond highlights. Mentally he's a basket case, a tough guy prone to sentimentality and weeping, with truly appalling taste in clothes.<br/><br/>His best friend is a lap dancing stripper (an excellent and brave performance from Marisa Tomei) and he makes ends meet working in a deli. At night he returns to his trailer park home, unless he's late with the rent, when the landlord locks him out and he sleeps in his truck. After one particularly brutal bout of extreme wrestling he suffers a heart attack and nearly quits, but the thought of a rematch with his nemesis The Ayatollah, brings him back to the ring one last time. You've seen it all before but it manages to stay remarkably fresh, and the writers and director deserve full credit for that.<br/><br/>Personally I can't stand pro wrestling, and the thought that there are people out there in the real world who actually enjoy watching grown men jump off step ladders onto each other's bellies, roll around on barbed wire and cut themselves with razor blades, makes me despair for the future of the human race. This is not a film for the squeamish. It's gripping and entertaining in a high quality Friday Night Fluff kind of way, but it didn't stay with me long after the lights went on.<br/><br/>Whether or not Mickey Rourke deserves an Oscar is another question entirely. Does he truly get under the skin of a character or is he basically playing an extreme version of his younger self? After all, he's been a boxer, wrestling isn't that much of a stretch from boxing. He certainly deserves a nomination, but if I had an Oscar vote, it would be going to Sean Penn for Milk."
"darthdavid65","Null","2","3","29 January 2009"," Completely left me hanging! *Spoiler Alert* Only read this if you've seen the film!
","Before I go into my reason for writing this, I'd like to get some things out of the way. ""The Wrestler"" was an outstanding film. Every actor, especially Mickey Rourke did an incredible job. Aronofsky's directing style was compelling, and original, and the story is one to remember.<br/><br/>But you know all of this already. The great reviews and enormous hype told you all of this , so why am I writing this then? Because this film was very near perfection. It was ALMOST an instant-classic, and ALMOST a piece of art. What stopped it? Well if you've read the summary of this comment, and have seen the film, then you already know.<br/><br/>The ending of the movie, or lack thereof, completely tarnished what would have been an incredible piece of cinema. Ambiguity isn't a new trick used by filmmakers to end movies, but it can be a difficult card to play. When used for this movie, it was an utter failure. The reason it failed here is because the entire movie is based around Randy ""The Ram"", and his struggles. The movie is almost completely guided by Rourke's character. I spent 2 hours watching this movie, caring about the character as he developed, and literally praying he would come out of his final fight alright. Aronofsky did a wonderful job by giving ""The Ram"" the sympathy of the audience, but wasted it by not giving any form of resolution in the end. I'm not saying I need a happy ending, Aronofsky could have killed him if he wanted to, but the fact is that he should have done something. I understand that it can be effective to leave it to the interpretation of the audience, but when you spend an entire movie developing a character, you simply must give him an endpoint. Whether ""The Ram"" was designed to be a tragic hero, or a success story, there should have been some closure. I'm not saying that they needed to do a whole 15-minute ending where he solely either wins or dies, but a simple 30 extra seconds of film, at least showing the end of the fight would have sufficed. I think it's such a punch in the face, no pun intended, for Aronofsky to give the audience someone to care so much about, and then not resolve his story in any way. It's not artistic, it's lazy, and careless. If he's a tragic hero, then complete the tragic downfall. If he's a success story, then let him live, but for God's sake, DON'T leave it up to the audience. With a story like this, and a character like ""The Ram"", it's just plain wrong. You can call me old-fashioned, or close-minded, but every story needs an ending, and ""The Wrestler"" just flat-out didn't have one. The only solace I found in the half-done final minutes of the movie was Bruce Springsteen's fantastic song. This song deserved the Oscar nomination it was so unfairly denied, but I guess that's a rant for another time."
"Matt_Layden","8","2","3","25 January 2009"," You Will Cheer For The Wrestler
","An aging and broken down wrestler tries to live a normal life outside the ring, but when things get even worse in his life, he turns to the one thing that kept him going and made him feel loved, wrestling.<br/><br/>Mickey Rourke's performance as Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson is honest, heart-breaking and real. Probably the most real performances I've seen this year and one of my personal favourites. True, the story of this character mirrors the life of the actor himself and it's obvious that he brought that with him, but it's hard to watch this film and not cheer for him, feel sorry for him and want everything to work out in the end for him.<br/><br/>This is the 4th film from Darren Aronofsky and it goes back to his more independent roots, like his first feature Pi. Not saying his other two features who big Hollywood productions, but anyway. The Wrestler is shot in a gritty, low budget documentary style that suits the film to a tee. This isn't high production value WWE wrestler. This is the independent, small ring, small crowds, real pain wrestling and the way they shot it reflects just that. This character study wouldn't have had the same impact if it looked clean and pristine. It would have felt fake.<br/><br/>The two, often misjudged, professions in this film are wrestling and stripping. People often throw wrestling aside claiming it to be fake. The film makes to effort to take one side or the other, it just tells it like it is. Yes, these guys know how it is going to go down and who is going to win, they have the moves mapped out before the match begins, but it's really their bodies being thrown to the floor, it's really their heads being smashed with a chair. As we see in the movie, the blood is sometimes self-inflicted, for the show and entertainment. Yet, it is still their blood that is being drawn.<br/><br/>The second is stripping, which is where Marisa Tomei enters the film. The one character who Randy is able to have a relationship with, even if it is a short lived lap dance and he has to pay for it. Here is a guy that can't pay to keep his trailer open for him, but is willing to spend 60 bucks on a lap dance. Is it because he is horny, or he is in need for some kind of human contact, somebody to talk to. Well, it turns out he actually likes the broad, but guess what, she doesn't date customers. Ouch, another hit in the face for Randy in the real world.<br/><br/>After Randy has a heart attack he is told he can't wrestle and Cassidy/Pam (stage name and real name) tells him to go see his daughter. The only problem is they haven't spoken in years. He hasn't been a father to her, he doesn't know what music she likes, what type of person she is, or even her birth date. He tries his best to re-connect with her and pours his heart out. I wanted this relationship to work more then the one with the stripper, this one felt more real. I can't say too much about Evan Rachel Wood, she plays the clich√©d teen angst daughter. We've seen her do this before with the film Thirteen. <br/><br/>As good as Rourke is in the film, there was not one scene that particularly jumped out at me as amazing. I was waiting for a scene in which he would knock me out of my seat, yet that never happened. It could be because he's really good throughout the entire thing and that the entire film is his one scene that will knock you out. The film is not to be outdone by Rourke's performance either.

","""The Wrestler"" centers on Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson (Mickey Rourke), a wildly popular professional wrestler from 2 decades ago who now barely makes ends meet as an aging wrestler in the independent circuit. With his health beginning to fail from his physically demanding job, he tries to amend his life by quitting wrestling, reconciling with his daughter he abandoned long ago and pursuing Cassidy, a prostitute he's been infatuated with for quite sometime. But his efforts failed him, and then he receives an offer to do a high-profile rematch with his nemesis ""The Ayatollah"", the match could be his ticket to fame once again. Failing health and all, he must decide whether life is better lived inside the ring, or outside of it.<br/><br/>Love. Pain. Glory.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky's movie is a deeply affecting meditation of the three, and bears many parallels to life as we AIM to live it. Wrestling serves as a metaphor for Randy's stage, a place that is not offered him by the real world. In many ways, the wrestling ring is the only place for randy that he can be himself, stripped of his humanly imperfections and adulated by his fans. In life, he's never had the appreciation of the important people in his life.<br/><br/>When Cassidy and Randy started to develop a friendship, randy thought they were headed for the start of a beautiful relationship, but Cassidy, though full of warmth and honest in friendship, turns down Randy and explains that she, like randy the wrestler, puts on a show, as far as she's concerned, he's only a customer who pays just like everyone else. Randy is so torn he goes on to binge on sex, drugs and alcohol that same night, TOTALLY forgetting he's supposed to meet his daughter, (whom he has had small progress with) for a pre-planned dinner...<br/><br/>In one night, he lost permanently (in a manner of speaking) the two important people in his life.<br/><br/>In some ways, Cassidy and Randy are both similar and different. Similar because both Randy and Cassidy are in a ""world"" where the corruption of the body is the trade. Different because Randy does his job out of satisfaction from the glory, while Cassidy treats prostitution as a means to an end, to raise her son. Perhaps Randy saw in Cassidy something that is more important than Glory---- Love.. Randy, at this stage in his life recognizes his need for emotional connection, something real, something that no ""perfect stage"" can ever supply. But when the world deprives him of this need, it becomes his realization that the pain from inside the ring is no match against the pain present outside of it..<br/><br/>The pain of LOSS and ALIENATION.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Less than 24 hours before the unveiling of the Oscar nominees, I'm surprised there's not much kudos going around for Darren Aronofsky's ""The Wrestler""... but what is even more surprising is the seemingly unanimous opinion that The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a ""LOCK"" at the Oscar best picture nominations while ""The Wrestler"" isn't even mentioned in many ""top 10s"" from film sites and film forums. How can a film THIS GOOD be overlooked by the cinephiliacs...<br/><br/>The mad love i have for Slumdog Millionaire stays after my 3rd viewing, the movie's technical virtuoso and the directing are all topnotch and it may very well get the Oscar for best picture... but if THE WRESTLER gets nominated alongside slumdog for BEST PICTURE, i won't be surprised if this dark horse edges slumdog for the statuette."

","""Hey Mickey, you are so fine, you are so fine, you blow my mind, hey Mickey, hey Mickey"". Those infamous music lyrics are from Toni Basil 80's hit song ""Mickey"". Who knows? Maybe Toni was dedicating the song to 80's acting icon Mickey Rourke. The Mick powerfully acted in such 80's cult classics as: ""Body Heat"", ""Diner"", ""Rumble Fish"", ""9 ¬Ω Weeks"", and ""Barfly"". Rourke roared on screen with magnetism, coolness, and self-assurance in the 80's. Mickey did not have many obstacles to wrestle back then except: women, fame, and money; and those are matches made in Hollywood heaven. Then the 90's rolled around and Roarke hit rock bottom! And there the internal wrestling with personal traumas, egoistic insubordination, and lost opportunities took a toll on Rourke physically and emotionally. Well, the good news is that the vigorous thespian roar of Rourke is back in a winning way with his superb performance as wrestler Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson in ""The Wrestler"". Rourke has been gradually climbing the comeback ladder in recent years with impressive supporting roles in ""The Pledge"", ""Sin City"", and ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico"". However, those were just opening acting matches for the main event of Rourke's comeback in the form of ""The Wrestler"". Director Darren Aronofsky's heartbreaking but aspiring film rams it in as one of the best of the year. I was in awe in how Robinson's character is analogous to the man Mickey Rourke himself. But the commending aspect is how Rourke can somehow differentiate & assimilate between the two with his poignant performance. The fictional character Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson was a famous 80's wrestler with a cult following who somehow lost his ways in the 90's and thereafter. The present Robinson is lonely, contrived, and melancholy; he still has a passion to wrestle, but he is not wrestling in the same packed arenas he used to headline at his peak. Now he wrestles for little money at small wrestling shows at VFW halls. Randy is also a part-time grocery employee in order to make ends meat. He visits a city strip club on occasion mainly to see Cassidy, a middle-aged stripper with a heart of gold. Randy and Cassidy are not exactly lovebirds but it's the closest thing to a romance in ""The Wrestler"". Marisa Tomei's work as Cassidy continues to demonstrate that her raw acting proficiency continues at a consistency level. Note to Academy: Please give the Mona Marisa a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination. Randy also tries to reconnect with his estranged daughter Stephanie, who despises him due to childhood abandonment. Their heartfelt emotional roller-coaster scenes are of the supreme handkerchief material. The underrated Evan Rachel Wood was potent as Stephanie, and hope her performance in ""The Wrester"" is a call to Hollywoodland to give her more credibility as one of today's best young actresses. Another nice slamming touch to ""The Wrestler"" is how Aronofsky truly depicts on how wrestlers support each other and are affable to one another outside the ring. Robert Siegel's screenplay of ""The Wrestler"" will be hard to defeat as the championing one of 2008. It was that strong, genuine, and reflective! The film's cinematography, editing, and art direction are also bona fide contenders to deservingly receive Oscar noms. And what can I say about Mr. Aronofsky, you get straight A's Mr. A for your tour-de-force direction of ""The Wrestler""; hope an Oscar ring comes your way Mr. A! Even though ""The Wrestler"" had a tag-team cast and crew to make it a winning film, the ultimate ringleader of the movie was Mickey Rourke with his astonishing performance which should present him with a Best Actor Oscar and a legitimate resurrection back to the film industry! Keep blowing our mind Mickey! Its guys like you Mickey that inspire us to reach for the top no matter how many slams life gives us! ***** Excellent"

","I was never a professional wrestling fan as a child. My brother was and so I occasionally caught the weekly shows because I was too lazy to get off the couch when he would watch them. I never understood the appeal. How could grown men rolling around on the floor together in an obviously choreographed battle appeal to the straight male? Is wrestling the straight man's ballet? And though I never understood why, my brother and legions of other men (and women) would watch religiously to see who would be smashed with a chair while the referee was lying unconscious on the floor. Amidst all of the spectacle though, it is easy to forget that the men in tights put on pants just like the rest of us when the show is done and go home to their lives. Darren Aronofsky is here to remind us of this and to show us the softer or more human side of THE WRESTLER.<br/><br/>From the moment is begins, with an opening credit montage highlighting the career accomplishments of former wrestling superstar, Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson (Mickey Rourke) over a throwback hair-metal song, you know that you are in for a dirty ride. The Ram has got to be in his sixties at this point. It has been twenty years since he played Madison Square Garden and now he is the main attraction at local wrestling matches that are put up in high school gymnasiums and workout centers. He has no one of significance in his life; he can barely afford his trailer park home; and the steroids and numerous other drugs he has consumed and is still currently consuming have taken their toll on his weathered body. Yet still, he soldiers on. As long as he has his wrestling, he has purpose. Then one day, even that is taken away. Who does a man become when he can no longer be who he has always known himself to be?<br/><br/>THE WRESTLER is Aronofsky's finest work. It marks the first time in his major film-making career where he did not direct a script that he himself wrote. That credit goes to novice writer, Robert D. Siegel. Siegel's script is bare, honest and frank. It follows The Ram during this hard transitional period of his life and Aronofsky follows behind as though he were filming some trashy reality TV show. After all, this is a dirty story that goes back and forth between wrestling rings, strip clubs and trailer parks. Aronofsky does not sensationalize though. Instead, his newfound simplicity allows the humanity of all on screen to flow freely and freely is exactly how it flows from this immensely talented cast. Marisa Tomei plays The Ram's love interest, a stripper named Cassidy. Not only does she look incredible working the stage but her off stage persona is a great mix of tender and tired. It is a welcome reminder that Tomei is one of today's most underrated actresses. And then of course there is the wrestler himself. Rourke is revelatory. He is lonely and broken but still picking himself up and doing whatever needs doing. To watch a man of his age endure what he does in the ring makes you root hard for him but the horrifying violence also inspires intense sympathy.<br/><br/>THE WRESTLER is about purpose. After Aronofsky's last film, THE FOUNTAIN, failed and fell apart quite publicly, it would stand to reason that he may have been questioning his own purpose. Just like The Ram knows only how to be a wrestler though, Aronofsky has to be a filmmaker. Whatever confidence he may have lost has been forgotten as THE WRESTLER is a brave move away from the visual trickery and style he had become accustomed to. It is the natural simplicity of his new direction that makes THE WRESTLER so relatable, inspires great caring for its characters and solidifies it as Aronofsky's best work."
"Red_Identity","Null","2","3","28 December 2008"," A truly remarkable Motion Picture
","The Wrestler is a truly remarkable film.<br/><br/>The Wrestler is done with such skill and passion. Mickey Rourke gives the best leading male performance of the year. He is just so into character here, it is also done so realistically. His performance is one that will certainly enter the classic list of male performances of all time. I thought that Marisa Tomei also gave such an incredible and realistic performance. Her portrayal of a 'hidden' stripper is perfect. She deserves an Oscar nomination. I also thought that, with all the buzz on Rourke and Tomei, people forgot about Evan Rachel Wood. Wood proves to be one of the most talented young actresses of her generation. Her performance is perfect, she captures all her feelings and emotions so well. One of the best female supporting performances of the year.<br/><br/>Overall, such a touching and gripping film, probably the most touching of 2008. It is done with such realism, this is sure to become a sports movie classic."

","This movie is great in a lot of ways the wrestling moves were pretty real and the acting felt natural and they did make up corny lines which was enjoyable if there is anything bad about this movie it would be that there wasn't enough fights and the drug usage is quite real looking but it puts out a message that any one who thinks pro wrestlers are clean are totally mistaken. I have got to watch this one again its one of those movies that you have to see again to see if you missed out on anything. I think i still need to give credit that this is a low budget film and doesn't have much if any CGI effects so don't expect to much.<br/><br/>But do yourself a favor and watch this one it is a true classic that people will flock to see"
"bkimbrell0","9","2","3","26 December 2008"," The Wrestler (2008)
","This is what I have been waiting for. Darren Aronofsky, the director of Pi, Requiem for a Dream, and The Fountain, offers up his latest, and greatest, film yet (and I thought it couldn't get any better than Requiem.) The Wrestler stars Mickey Rourke as washed-up professional wrestler Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson, in the greatest performance of this year. The Wrestler is a magnificent near-masterpiece that I haven't been able to shake from my mind; it will stay with you, I promise.<br/><br/>The Wrestler can be thought of as an expose on the professional wrestling industry, and the health and relationship issues its stars face as the years of abuse inflicted on their body, both outwardly in the ring, and inwardly through strenuous training and drug use, take hold of their lives. The Wrestler may also be thought of as an emotional father and daughter drama piece, as Randy attempts to make amends with his long-estranged daughter Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood) after having an epiphany. In addition, the film can also be thought of as a story of mutual human compassion between Randy and an exotic dancer he has come to befriend over the years named Pam (Marisa Tomei); both feel trapped and alone, but their mutual friendship seems to be a light in the dark. But most of all, The Wrestler can be thought of as easily one of the greatest films of the year, rivaling many films I've seen in the past decade.<br/><br/>This film is gritty, violent, and extremely difficult to watch at times. It is heartbreaking, tragic, and yet also quite humorous at exactly the right moments. The finale will remain in my mind for years to come, with a mind-blowing ending that makes the ending of last year's No Country for Old Men look amateurish by comparison. Mickey Rourke is unbelievable; I cannot over-hype his performance in this. No matter what, it will be better than you think. One scene in particular echoes Marlon Brando in On the Waterfront, in which Randy pleads for his daughter's forgiveness. If there is one thing wrong with this film, it's that Rourke makes Tomei and Wood look weak by comparison, even though Wood gives an excellent performance as well.<br/><br/>I love The Wrestler, perhaps more than any film since 2006 besides WALL-E. It has heart in all the right places, especially the dialogue between the pro wrestlers backstage, and during Randy's job at a supermarket. You will laugh, you will definitely cringe, and you might possibly cry. The title of this film has a double meaning; going in, you will presume the title refers to the profession of the main character. Upon exiting, you will understand that the title refers to what the main character must do every day of his life as his health and relationships crumble beneath him: Wrestle with life.<br/><br/>9.5/10. See it now."
"cgodburn","Null","2","3","15 December 2008"," Makes up for ""The Fountain""
","Darren Aronofsky's ""The Wrestler"" is something of a miracle considering it is by the same filmmaker who brought the self absorbed disaster ""The Fountain"" to theaters two years ago. The differences between ""The Wrestler"" and that film are so many that if one didn't know who directed both films, you'd think they were made by two different people.<br/><br/>""The Wrestler"" follows a washed up performer, played and lived by Mickey Rourke, as he tries to reclaim his title as the greatest wrestler in the business. Fighting old age, sore muscles as well as hearing and sight problems, Rourke's character continues to subject himself to the human cockfighting that is performed in elementary schools on Saturday afternoons. The character (known here as Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson) is the the perfect role for Rourke, and it would be hard to imagine anyone else (specifically Nicolas Cage, who was briefly involved with this project) playing Ram with such depth and heartache.<br/><br/>What really stands out about this film, aside from Rourke's performance, is the care that Aronofsky takes to throw in details about the business that only a true die hard wrestling fan would know. Details such as the men prepping for their matches, and spouting off lingo like, ""Let's bring it on home"" to signal the ending of a fight help bring a certain authenticity to the film. The other thing that Aronofsky does is that he takes a close, critical look at an American subculture, which allows the audience to wonder just why exactly do we love this so much? The fans in the ring cheer as men beat themselves up for our amusement. We know it's not real but we cheer anyway. Not only that, but why is this 'sport' so viscerally exciting to watch? What is it about grown, sometimes old, men in tights leaping around on a mat so entertaining?<br/><br/>Ultimately, ""The Wrestler"" comes to criticize the business not only because of it's odd attraction that people have towards it, but also because of the way it treats the men who give up their lives for it."

Tjis is an entertaining thoughtful story of a has been entertainment wrestler who is now ailing and older and highly struggling to make ends meet. Mickey Rourke should have wo the best actor oscar for his portrayal of said main character. In the film we experience touching moments when he tries to get serious with a stripper, and as well trying to reconnect with his estranged daughter. It's very honest, in depth and at times straight up or oddly funny. It features some digestible yet deep serious psychology to it. The director knows humanity so well overall that this film features one of the best depictions of what trash really is- I'm talking in the scene where the main character parties hard with a white trash sttumpet chick and spends the night in her low budget row socisl housing house and find that she's got a sick firefighter obsession. The fact that she's got s pet ferret says it all. The film also shows some great violent wrestling scenes for fans of the entertainment sport. The actor who plays the stripper, his love interest and supporter/ champion of sorts should have won her second oscar for this as well. An awesome movie with no wasted frames ending with a beautiful existential moment. The gritty 16mm film cinematography captures the spirit of the film too."

","Directed by Darren Aronofsky. Starring Mickey Rourke, Marisa Tomei, Evan Rachel Wood, Todd Barry, Donnetta Lavinia Grays, Ernest Miller, Dylan Keith Summers, Judah Friedlander, Wass Stevens, Mark Margolis. (R)<br/><br/>Unflinching, fascinating study of Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson (Rourke), a professional wrestler a couple decades removed from his prime, barely scraping by while dealing with sustained physical pain and emotional regret. Aronofsky's raw, documentary-style approach to the material sinks the viewer deeper into the wrestler's world, utilizing evocatively shabby and grimy New Jersey locations to match the broken-down nature of its central figure. Rourke presumably drew upon his own fallen-from-grace life experience for his portrayal and gives, to forgive the clich√É¬©d plaudit, the performance of a lifetime; Wood and especially Tomei score as well, respectively playing his estranged daughter and a stripper struggling to separate her personal and professional lives (and Randy's place in both). Hard to say what's tougher to watch: the torment inflicted in the ring (including some memorably gruesome stuff involving barbed wire and staples) or the torment worn on his grizzled face as he takes stock of his life, wears the weight of so many failures, and continues the pattern of destroying that which he tries so desperately to forge and mend. Some of the plotting can be a bit predictable--the relationship with his daughter can't evade inevitability--but this movie is defined by character, setting, and mood far more than narrative progression.<br/><br/>88/100"

"tabuno","8","1","1","20 January 2019"," Visually Stunning and Authentic Human Story
","7 February 2009. What is acting and performing? ""The Wrestler"" raises some interesting questions as to what constitutes a best actor award and how one differentiates a good actor from a great actor. With Mickey Rourkes' performance it's difficult to tell. Is Mr. Rourke so good in this movie because he is just being himself? Or is it that he is able to bring something extra to the role? Is it the script? Directing? Or does it even matter? Nevertheless, Mr. Rourke's presentation on the big screen feels genuine, authentic, real. There is depth to his character from funny, to subdued, to frustrated, along with a wide ranging diversity of moods and emotions coming off the screen.<br/><br/>What is a good movie, is it realism, is it dramatics, is it catharsis, is it cinematography? Director Darren Aronofsky uses a real hand held camera style and visually raw video style similar to Cloverfield (2008) without all the flashing lights and fancy out of your way to promote how real it all feels. What is good drama? Is it over dramatization, high-lighting? Where is the distinction between reality, a documentary, and a fictional story. In ""The Wrestler"" the boundaries between a documentary and a fictional drama become blurred because the cinematography captures an almost you are there experience and what feels real, like shooting just what is naturally occurring and what might come from the imagination of someone's mind and this script sometimes obliterates this distinction by its immersion into a depth of a truly provocative, almost voyeuristic look into these people's lives.<br/><br/>The weak portions of this movie come from the superficial handling of the relational depth of the characters. Marisa Tomei's relationship with Mr. Rourke sometimes doesn't seem fleshed out to withstand scrutiny. The emotional connection, underpinning seems only surface deep. Evan Rachel Wood's character is also limited and there are some assumptions and omitted background details that not being in the movie make for her behavior somewhat suspicious and manipulative for the sake of the script and drama. Finally the ending allows the director to leave too much of the burden on the audience without committing himself, preventing the audience from experiencing a truly emotional stingingly powerful conclusion.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is a solid, penetrating look at a person whose life raises questions about our own. It promotes and challenges the audience to question themselves. But its outlook seems fatalistic and perhaps that is appropriate, but it would have been something truly inspirationl if Marisa Tomei's character (with further development in the movie) and her relationship with Mr. Rourke's Randy had been solidified to the point where she could have become much more of a presence at the end and perhaps even influenced more significantly the outcome of the movie. We'll never know."

People mock how fake wrestling is, but those talented guys bend over backwards to entertain the audience with incredibly painful stunts. The film was shot in the winter in New Jersey and this augments the bleak pall.<br/><br/>On the female front, Marisa is absolutely stunning as Cassidy (aka Pam) and Wood is convincing as the embittered daughter.

","If I know Rourke thanks to Iron man 2, and I've seen his well played act on Sin City. But when i saw this movie its beyond Rourke i know. <br/><br/>One of great actor'skill is when he can handle multiple layer of character naturally, at the same time. First, Rourke a wrestler(1), not a fighter, which is already need to perform as entertainer(2). Also, he's a washed up wrestler(3), which added more acting burden to struggle like well being wrestler. All those energy, pain, doubt, brought up nicely. Great realism. This way, at first minutes he's done great job to made us believe that he's a genuine wrestler. At least experienced one.<br/><br/>Then, common belief of good wrestler is being nice guys in real life. We were relieved as he played with kids and gives signature to some folks. Another realism, we know this guy. Until the moment of drama comes, something we rarely paid attention before from fun- friendly-macho guys; his struggle in real life with job, her daughter, and love life. All those images that have built up melting into loving father figure and lonely guy. We fall for him, befriend with him, and weep with him. Rourke's first tears becomes priceless altogether. It is probably due the nature of his character, but i can't see it being done by some mere buffed up actor. <br/><br/>Its a wonder, really, why Rouke didn't received Oscar at the time."

","This is one of the greatest personal stores put on the big screen you can ask for and A great tale about finding another place in life when you can't do your part anymore.Mickey Rourke killed it as the ram,He did a great job playing a washed out wrestler who just keeps becoming less and less optimistic as time goes on and certain events take place in his life,One being where he gets a heart attack and won't be able to wrestle without killing himself because of it this makes him get the deli counter job and thanks to some advice from Cassidy makes him talk to his daughter Stephanie who he was never there for when she was a child. This movie also does a good job showing to fight the man if he makes things to harsh on you and isn't doing anything to help you on the job,He does have some fun throwing food at the customers but when he gets his hand stuck in a meat grinder thats when he just quits in rage ,that on top of his boss acting like a prick to him ,can you blame him . Randy finds his daughter and starts to repair their bond together,Which includes a amazing monologue from Rourke telling her how wrong him avoiding her was while trying to make it up to her,and lets just say tears were shed during that scene. His second monologue when he's going to fight the ayatollah ,Which is his biggest rival in wrestling and is being called ""The Fight of the Century"" therefore this match really hyped.The quiet scenes actually say a lot when Clint Mansells score kicks in ,It shows how the sport of wrestling is killing him Psychically and mentality. The scene where Cassidy and Randy are facing in the bar was a nice thing to add to bring some fun and to tribute the music of the 80's He starts losing the ones he loves when Cassidy tells him the truth of their relationship and when he forgot to meet his daughter after having sex with a hooker,This shows after loosing Cassidy he wants to try to fill in that gap but he fails to ,This also makes his daughter quit on him in tears as stated before . Randy initially canceled the Ayatollah vs The Ram match because of his healthy but with nothing left,not even a paycheck for the match,He decides to go through with it anyways ,Shows that he just wants to go out in glory and not continue being washed up and miserable ,This leads to the night of the match where before going out Cassidy tries to stop him and having her tell him despite of what happened between them before states""Im here,Im really here"" which is a good way to show you don't know what you have in life until you loose it.Randy says to her that the crowd is counting on him for this match and this is where he belongs ,Cassidy watches him enter the ring where Randy makes a really heartfelt speech stating really vaguely and generally what he's learned with his experiences with Cassidy and Stephanie but how he's still ready to support his fans despite his flaws .The match with the Ayatollah was brutal to watch,He was willing to stop the fight when he recognized Randy was actually in pain but he insists which leads to a scene where the final round happens and The Ayatollah tells ram to bring it home ,With nothing left to lose the ram ,Climbs the ropes ,positive that this may be his left breath and tackles The Ayatollah ,Does a good job showing that at least he gets to go out with a good wrestling buddy of his and as said before and thats one of the reasons he still wants to do this.Finding a flaw with this movie is like bring to make a bullfrog trying to solve calculus .Definitely glad i watched this .Thank you Darren Aronofsky for showing that these guys and girls have more to do then entertain,You have put passion into this movie just like the ram puts passion into his family ,his friends ,his love,His jobs and his sport."
"brianberta","8","1","1","5 April 2015"," A moving story about passion with great acting
","This is a great film topped off by Mickey Rourke's outstanding performance. It's about a wrestler who is forced to stop his career because he might die of a heart attack. The film shows him struggling to find something else in life he likes doing. He then meets an exotic dancer who he falls in love with who is also ready to start a new life. His acting performance is definitely one of the more iconic ones of the last couple decades. The movie is about his struggle to move on with life and his new found girlfriend and his daughter both give him courage to move on and we can sympathize with him. The ending is ambiguous and it leaves room for discussion so the viewer can decide whether ending he prefers. I'm not going to spoil the ending but it makes us think if he made the right or wrong choice so I appreciate the choice the film made. I don't think younger audiences would be able to relate with Randy ""The Ram"" because it contains some deep concepts but older people would likely be able to relate with him and enjoy the movie more. If you like wresting and want to see a moving story about passion then this movie is for you."

","It's truly a shame that a film as captivating as ""The Wrestler"" can go ignored by so many viewers based purely on its subject matter. The professional wrestling industry has been a joke from its incarnation, yet only one watch of this film will give you a whole new respect for the men and women that step inside the squared circle. ""The Wrestler"" isn't a documentary, but its cinematography allows you to get lost in the story and believe everything happening to Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson is true. Mickey Rourke puts on a performance of a lifetime and transforms himself into a broken down former wrestling great that is now living in his past; milking every ounce of glory that he has left in his body.<br/><br/>From beginning to end we as the viewer can't help but like Randy no matter how many flaws he reveals. It doesn't matter he can't pay his rent or takes illegal drugs; his charm pushes those faults to the back and it becomes very believable that he was a main even icon twenty years earlier. The interplay between Rourke and Marisa Tomei is captivating. Tomei's Cassidy is a stripper paralleling Randy's conflict with age. Her best years behind her, Cassidy doesn't have the same passion for her career that 'The Ram' does. Cassidy does it for the money, Ram does it for the fame. It's in Randy's attempt to transition into something more that we see ourselves. Coming to grips that his body can't handle anymore physical abuse he does everything he can do rebuild broken relationships and build new ones.<br/><br/>Mickey Rourke must be applauded for his commitment to the role. This performance required 100% investment in order to truly capture the essence of the film; he did that and more. A role that catapulted back into mainstream discussion of leading men, Rourke must have seen a little of himself in this character. The result of his work was an Academy Award nomination for Best Leading Man. Physically, Mickey looked the part so much that we start to believe that he's the man he's portraying. In an industry like professional wrestling where so much importance is invested into name value, very little suspension of disbelief is necessary in creating a realistic wrestling world for us to attach to. Mickey instantly gives the fictional environment credibility.<br/><br/>With the limited budget, Director, Aronofsky ends up with a film that benefits from the lack of gloss and glamor. Another director with more money might have been inclined to bring in more wrestlers with name value and larger venues thus losing the intimate charm we find here. The behind the back filming style along with the incredibly strong score rounds out an ""independent"" gem that must be experienced. Don't let the plot, revolving around a professional wrestler, sour your impression into missing one of the best films of this century.<br/><br/>Read this and my other film reviews at CD1083.com"
"Fluke_Skywalker","8","1","1","29 July 2014"," A winner
","Director Darren Aronofsky's 'The Wrestler' is a bleak and uncompromising look at a fallen star and what lengths he goes to in order to hang onto the very bottom rung of his former glory. Shot and edited in an almost documentary fashion, it's an incredibly immersive experience that makes you feel a part of the story.<br/><br/>For Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson (Mickey Rourke), the cheers of the sparse crowds that show up to his low rent wrestling events help to drown out the screams of his inner demons, and the toughest opponent he faces is not inside the ring, but inside himself. I found my self rooting for Randy despite his flaws and the obvious mistakes that he's made. A lot of credit for that goes to Rourke, who gives as good a performance as I've ever seen from an actor. It's just so note perfect that you'll forget you're watching an actor perform. With all due respect to Sean Penn, Rourke should've taken home the Oscar in '08.<br/><br/>This is no 'Rocky' style underdog tale. It's a harsh slice of life that is all too often the reality for those who reach the dizzying heights of fame and crash without a parachute."
"redryan64","7","1","1","19 May 2014"," Grappling With The Truth.....................
","THERE'S NO DOUBT in our mind that the Writer, Director, Cast and the rest of the Production Team had the best of intentions in putting this one together. With the Pro Wrestling game being the hybrid sports/entertainment creature that it is and has been, it is a subject that interests people of a great cross section of society. Be they Doctors or Dock Workers, Stock Brokers or Stock Yardmen, or whatever the walk of life; there's interest in in ""Rasslin!"" <br/><br/>AND THE FILM does make the point that this is a game of big egos, chiseling promoters and a loyal, yet fickle following. All of these attributes may well apply to life in general; ergo, Wrestling's mass appeal.<br/><br/>THE PORTRAYAL OF our protagonist, Randy 'the Ram' Robinson does ring true in several respects. First, as we intimated earlier, the big ego-he has it. Secondly, he has a strong desire to get back in the game-in spite of medical condition and he has a need to perform; he'll do so at even a diminished level for a much smaller purse ($$$).<br/><br/>WHILE THE PRODUCTION team nails these certain elements of the Pro Game, in others they are obviously have not been an insider; such as this writer was. Case in point: while there is a great camaraderie among Pro Gtapplers, you'd never see them ""High Fiving"" each other the way it is portrayed. But, you'll have to take our word for that one; because we won't tell you! <br/><br/>AND IN SPITE of a Wrestler's outward appearance, which may vary from being fit & fabulous to fat & fastidious. A Wrestler with a full schedule leads a very unhealthy life. If really in demand, he may be working 3-5 times a week and that means constant travel. So,for many that life is not very long.<br/><br/>IN CLOSING THAT we must grade this film out with a C-. As a sort of contrasting dissertation, get a copy of Verne Gagne's THE WRESTLER (1974) with Ed Asner and Elaine Giftos. One can get it at Amazon.com or on Ebay."

"mrrockey","7","1","1","30 December 2013"," One of the Most Honest Movies Ever Made
","I gotta be brutally honest, I'm not the biggest fan of sports dramas. I really ain't. I mean, I liked Rocky, Raging Bull, The Fighter, and Warrior but generally, they bore me with all the clich√©s they are famous for. However, The Wrestler turned out to be a refreshing film in the genre as it doesn't feature the majority of clich√©s found in sport dramas. <br/><br/>It's a brutally honest, depressing portrait of an old, broken-down wrestler named Randy(Mickey Rourke) who was once a star but now, lives a life of wrestling in local arenas for minimum wages, struggling to pay for his trailer with very few friends and loved ones. After a brutal hardcore match, Randy suffers a heart attack and survives but is told to quit wrestling, so he decides to get his life back together as he tries to reconcile with his estranged daughter, Stephanie, and get into a serious relationship with this stripper he's been befriending, Pam.<br/><br/>What makes this film work is as I've said before, how honest it is. The story here isn't overly sentimental or sappy, it's rather frank about its characters and who they are. Randy is one of the most realistic protagonists I've ever seen and Mickey Rourke plays him beautifully. He's a flawed but kind soul who's ruined his life because of how dedicated he is to his passion and that's actually... kinda relatable. We've all made our lives a living Hell at one point because of our passion and Randy is the embodiment of that. He's a cautionary tale of what happens when we take our passion too far and end up sacrificing our personal lives for it.<br/><br/>Everybody else in the cast is strong too, particularly Marisa Tomei who plays Pam with warmth and complexity. She plays her as someone who may have feelings for Randy as he respects her as a stripper rather than insulting her like her other customers but since she's a stripper, she has a difficult time slipping into a real relationship with him and Tomei conveys these emotions perfectly.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky directed this film very naturally, he made use of hand-held camera-work excessively and while it's not something I'm usually fond of, Aronofsky makes it work and it adds realism to the film rather than distracting me like it often does. He makes the actors act very naturally, never going to far to the point of melodrama but enough emotion to let us feel something. It's a very hard balance to strike in this sort of film and he managed it very well. There's not a lot of music in the film but it makes the film feel more real and less manipulative because of it, so I thought it was a pretty bold artistic choice.<br/><br/>The only thing that really bothers me about this film is the ambiguous ending. Now don't get me wrong, I have no problems with ambiguous endings. I loved the endings of The Shining and A Nightmare on Elm Street. However, I didn't really feel this film NEEDED an ambiguous ending as it would've been much more poetic to have Randy just die in the end. I don't know, maybe I'm just a simpleton.<br/><br/>Overall, Aronofsky's natural direction and the strong cast makes for a wonderfully honest film that warns us about how obsessed we could be with our passions and how we could lose our lives because of it. 8/10. Great film, highly recommended."
"jose-cruz53","8","1","1","3 January 2013"," A powerful drama
","While I wouldn't classify the Wrestler as a masterpiece it is still a very strong film: It was one of the best films of 2008 and features a performance for the ages by Mickey Rourke, who plays an aging wrestler trying to deal with the problems in his life, mostly decorrent from his decadence in the sport. He has severe problems in terms of relationships with those he loves and is unable to function properly as a normal father to his daughter, as he cannot honor a commitment to show up at a certain time and place to his daughter. He almost broke my heart during the film as it shows a broken human being in a very realistic manner."
"drqshadow-reviews","8","1","1","19 March 2012"," Where Do We Turn When the Tools of Our Trade Quit on Us?
","Aronofsky's glimpse into the grim reality of retirement in pro wrestling is a tough, fair rumination on a physically unforgiving industry. Not as suicidally dark as Requiem for a Dream, but it doesn't need to be - where Requiem was about a self-destructive quest for the taste of an elusive high, The Wrestler is more interested in the shattered figure trying to cope with the repercussions of that lifestyle. Mickey Rourke nails the role of Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson, as advertised; the conflicting emotions of hope, guilt, desperation and cheap indulgence that flash across his face speak volumes when the character has very little to say for himself. Marissa Tomei is nicely cast as his counterpart, a stripper running into identical problems; aging in an industry that relies almost exclusively on one's superficial gifts. I didn't care for the ambiguous ending and found the in-ring scenes to be jumpy and weak, but loved the rich characterization, deep respect for the subject and long, unspoken history that precedes the events of the film."
"Leofwine_draca","9","1","1","11 February 2012"," Moving portrayal of a deeply flawed man
","Let's face it, Mickey Rourke is a bit of a joke these days. He's got a career littered with turkeys - even in his prime days back in the '80s - and a face so distorted by surgery that it's hard to recognise him, let alone take him seriously. Who would have thought he'd give the performance of the year in a wrestling biopic, of all things? The first clue that THE WRESTLER might be interesting lies in the director, Darren Aronofsky (he of the devastating REQUIEM FOR A DREAM). The script, layered with realism upon realism, ventures deep into the psyches of the characters, exposing their flaws, their backgrounds and the drives that make them tick, all through relatively little dialogue. Aronofsky's leisurely, unhurried style of mockumentary is the perfect fit for a perfect story.<br/><br/>Rourke isn't the only great member of the cast - Marisa Tomei's unflinching portrait of an ageing stripper is equally fine (although the less said about Evan Rachel Wood's bratty daughter the better). Despite the slow nature of the film, it does gradually build until an inevitable climax which had me on the edge of my seat - even though it doesn't show anything, not when it comes down to it.<br/><br/>Aronofsky can't resist throwing in one of the most grisly sequences I've seen in a mainstream movie - you'll know it when you see it - yet, deep down, this is a film all about heart and the human spirit. It's like ROCKY, in some ways, although it manages to get even deeper inside its flawed characters than the Stallone film ever managed. It's a fine movie."
"the_oak","Null","1","1","17 November 2011"," It's a hard life - find happiness where you can
","I liked this movie. There are many reasons. One is that we get so close to Randy. It becomes so realistic that we start to identify with him.I was surprised by that. What we see is that he is gentle. The same with the other wrestlers. They seem like good and friendly guys. At least I was surprised. At the same time, we learn that he is lonely. He struggles. In one scene Randy and a few other worn out, old time-heroes sit and sign autographs and sell DVD's. It's a sad sight. This also surprised me. So there is this two-fold surprise in the movie.<br/><br/>Another reason I liked the movie, is that he tries hard to find some happiness. There is a touching love story, and as we have already started to have sympathy with Randy, we start to feel the same for Cassidy. She is a local stripper, played by Marissa Tomei. She is so beautiful, and life is hard for her too, so we really hope that it will work out for them. I think Rourke and Tomei have good chemistry. Randy also tries to make it right with his daughter, who he has neglected. I think Evan Rachel Wood also a good choice for the role. The only thing that I can point my finger on, is the very predictable way Randy blew his last chance. I felt the daughter was too strict, almost as if she just had to follow the script.<br/><br/>A third reason I liked the movie is Mickey Rourke. I felt like I could identify more with Randy knowing the struggles Rourke has had in his private life. Not being judgemental. The Ram has his reasons, and I am sure Rourke had his. We all have.<br/><br/>A final reason is the ending. It is a relief that movies don't have to follow a certain formula. You could argue that this film has it's own formula that it has to follow, but at least it is a rare one.<br/><br/>I recommend The Wrestler. It is 1,5 hours well spent."

","I am writing this review to address the question of Rourke's nomination for Best Actor and his loss. If I am right, and please correct me if I am wrong, the Best Actor award that year went to Sean Penn in Harvey Milk. However much Penn's performance is admirable, I find that Rourke's performance and the story line of the film are more powerful and emotionally evocative than that found in Harvey Milk. Indeed, ""The Wrestler"" is similar to ""Crazy Heart"" for which Jeff Bridges won the Academy award. Crazy Heart is a wonderful film and Jeff Bridges gave a brilliant performance, but arguably not that different from that of Rourke in ""The Wrestler"". Comparing the two films, I would give the edge to The Wrestler."

","""The Wrestler"" is a movie about time and being molded to the process that one has lived for most of life. Being a part of something empowers one so much that the real world hardly matters. Same happens to Randy ""The Ram"", He's felt himself powerless in the outer world when age and his heart problem halts his professional wrestling. The progress of this story, which is about how a men living his life over the top of the ring stepping outside of arena is wonderfully unfolded. The Wrestler is a not a hard movie or the theme too is something that has been tried many times before but never before the tale has been as gripping as this one.<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT:: There are key moments in the film, as when Randy misses misses his dinner with Stephanie and apologizes, but Stephanie angrily cries and says that she never wants to see him again. Also the scene agitated Randy cuts his hand on the deli slicer machine and goes on a rampage in the store, before quitting. And Specially, the final scene where He climbs the top rope and stands up and salutes the crowd in tears as the screen abruptly cuts to black.<br/><br/>The director, Darren Aronofsky draws the this warm tale with honesty, keeping things as real as possible did a splendid job. This could have easily a lame movie if it wasn't this director since its real hard to make a movie with simplicity still having depth of an ocean.<br/><br/>Mickey Rouke was impressively enjoying this role. He was so real and brought so much of intensity to the role. Ditto for Marissa Tomei who complimented Mickey Rouke in every scene with her performance.<br/><br/>""The Wrestler"" is a lot of life, warmth in the friendship that builds up between Randy and Pam. The hardcore match in the match was exciting and a real thrill. But mostly the film takes a sensitive look at the fish out of water phenomenon."

","Mickey Rourke is an actor who has suffered ups and downs in his career. In the 80s he did star in popular films and he was respected: but he thrown it all away when he turned his back on acting in 1991 to become a boxer. He career in the 90s fell into the doldrums. It was only in 2005 Rourke won back the respect of audiences playing Marv in Sin City. The Wrestler was the final act of his acting rehabilitation was completed, earning himself an Oscar nod.<br/><br/>Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson (Mickey Rourke) was a popular wrestler in the 1980s, but by 2008 his career has fared and he is pasted his prime. He wrestles in New Jersey for die-hard fans and it is only purpose in life. Randy work in the back room of a supermarket and he is estrange from his daughter Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood) and he spends a lot of time in a sleazy strip club: his best friend is an ageing stripper Pam, stage-named Cassidy (Marisa Tomei). Randy is offered the chance to wrestler a re-match with his old rival the Ayatollah (Ernest Miller) (that's political correctness for you). But after a hardcore wrestling match Randy suffers a heart attack. His doctor tells him he can not wrestle any more and he is forced to retire. Randy gets a new job working behind a deli counter, and tries to rebuild his relationship with his daughter. He also starts to get closer with Pam, the two being kindred spirits. But the pull of wrestle continues to lead Randy down a path of self-destruction.<br/><br/>The Wrestler is of course Rourke's film: he deserved an Oscar nod, and he does offer a powerful performance, the best in his career. The scene at beach was worthy of that alone. This is a film about someone destruction, particularly because of their sport/passion, like in Raging Bull. But Rourke's performs only tells half the story. They are two other good performers in this film: Tomei and Wood. Tomei is not a one-dimensional character, she is a loving mother who sees Randy as a friend. She is someone who wants the best for her son, and wants to move away from her old life. Wood is an excellent actress ever since she came onto the scene with her powerhouse performance in Thirteen. Again she offers a good performance as a young woman who is bitter because of her father's abandonment. They are sadly some moment of overacting, particularly with her hand gestures, but it was still a good performance.<br/><br/>The Wrestler is Darren Aronofsky's first film since The Fountain, a marmite film: you either love it or hate it. With the Wrestler Aronofsky is playing it safer: telling a simple drama. Aronofsky casts good actors in the film, but not as emotionally powerful as Requiem for a Dream. Aronofsky uses hand-held cameras to great effort, having a number of steady cam shot following characters in continuous shots. It not like with Paul Greengrass whom films look like they are directed by a amateur with a small camcorder. The wrestling scene were excellently handled, and brutal, particularly the hardcore match. It was just an example of sado-masochism. Aronofsky also shows the gritty, industrial nature of this area of America. This is not the glamour or high live of the big cities or suburbania. This is a grim existence, and cinematographer Maryse Alberti does well filming The Wrestler in a almost documentary feel where you can feel the dirt.<br/><br/>It could be argued that the screenwriter Robert D. Siegel wrote a darker version of a Rocky film. But he does tell a emotional story with a lot of depth behind it. This was a fine screenplay telling how someone can be their own worst enemy.<br/><br/>This a worthy drama film, with excellent acting and good writing and direction behind it.<br/><br/>8.4/10"
"jonathanruano","9","1","1","13 March 2010"," The Wrestler -- A Review
","If you do not like watching wrestling, then you will still probably like ""The Wrestler."" Director Darren Aronofsky, whose cutting edge, raw style of filmmaking has attracted much controversy, has not only made a well-researched film about wrestling, but has more important animated it with compelling and quite touching human stories. None more touching and compelling was the story of Randy ""the Ram."" Mickey Rourke delivers a remarkable come-back performance as Randy ""the Ram"" who physically can no longer live up to the image of the legendary wrestler that he once was, but who in his heart of hearts cannot give up the wrestling profession. Why? Because the wrestling arena is the only place where Randy ""the Ram"" is not treated like a loser. In the arena, Randy finds camaraderie not only with his adoring fans, but with the other wrestlers. There are wonderful scenes where Randy and some other wrestler seem to beat each other up in the arena in some truly painful hardcore matches, but then become best friends after the fight is over. One of them asks Randy, ""Are you doing OK?"" Then they go out for beers. How cool is that?<br/><br/>But the best scenes in Randy's life are those that exist outside of the ring. There we watch Randy struggle with burden of being a loser in the world that exists outside of the ring. He does not seem to be going anywhere in life and he makes some bad choices almost with a naive innocence. Not surprisingly, his only daughter Stephane (Evan Rachel Wood) hates him; Randy has long ago given up trying to speak with Stephane's mother (she is not even in the film) and a possible emotional and intimate connection with a stripper named Cassidy (Marisa Tomei) is tenuous even at the best of times. And yet Aronofsky and writers Robert Siegel and Mickey Rourke (Rourke disliked the script at first and helped Siegel make substantial changes to it. Arguably those changes made ""The Wrestler"" a great film and earned Rourke a much deserved Academy Award nomination) help the audience understand Randy ""the Ram"" so well that it is just heart wrenching watching that man fall apart psychologically and physically over the course of the film."

Now, he is well past his peak. He is broke. And all he wants is love. But the realization comes in too late, perhaps.<br/><br/>Watch it for Mickey Rourke.

"Cristi_Ciopron","9","1","1","9 October 2009"," An interpretation of THE WRESTLER as decisive artistic phenomenon
","A naturalist, poignant drama about a contemporary gladiator, representation of an individual‚ÄîThe Ram‚Äîartistic creation of Rourke, and of a distinctive place in society‚Äîone of the many classes of pariahs, THE WRESTLER is artistically a better opportunity than the one wasted by Rourke when he refused Coolidge's part in PULP FICTION, because THE WRESTLER is the better thing, and perhaps even an opportunity that few great actors get once if ever. There is an inherent sensationalism of the approach‚Äîwell, what about the actual life of a Cro‚ÄîMag low‚Äîlife who sells himself to be massacred and beaten? The very violence looks unnecessary and derisory. But then again the movie has a sense of the places, of life, the places are well filmed, the urban environments, the movie is delightfully plastic, with a sense of the places that the early Demme and perhaps some independents had or have; Rourke spreads his wings, his performance is once again amazingly diversified, as he hadn't the occasion of such a nuanced play since BARFLY and HOMEBOY and FRANCESCO. HOMEBOY, another gladiator tale, was a badly written movie (--Rourke was the screenwriter--); THE WRESTLER is breathtakingly written. Rourke's face, that beloved face, is once again animated by intelligence. This is a movie about pariahs; and it has the instinct to deepen not bloody gory fight scenes, wrestling matches, but the other side of its protagonist's life.<br/><br/>THE WRESTLER is very mature, very significant, deeply straightforward, well grounded in facts and extremely well written. The originality of the approach serves the story.<br/><br/>Rourke did several gladiators in his career; at least in those three movies written by him. And THE WRESTLER is by far his best gladiator. This movie has depth, life, meaning, aim and also that '70s freshness in directing that corrects the grittiness and makes it plausible. The directing is original, sure, intelligent; and probably 'intelligence' and originality are the words I feel most compelled to say about THE WRESTLER.<br/><br/>THE WRESTLER is the upgraded HOMEBOY, if you take my meaning, a profoundly straightforward and grounded drama; and actors like De Niro and Willis and others didn't get such good roles and it's long since any of the significant American actors I follow has been offered such a significant role. Well, in this amount of rubbish, THE WRESTLER is the diamond.<br/><br/>Three more things:--the movie has style;--it's fun, its naturalness allows it this fun, and it's never socially preachy;--it has gusto, atmosphere, the score sounds terrific. So 9/ 10, which means a truly awesome movie.<br/><br/>THE WRESTLER begins right in the middle of the things‚Äîno conventionality or schmaltz. That's due to the so intelligent and uncompromising script. The script and story, the direction, the performances, the score, the photography, the sets are all on the right side. This is the great independent movie that Rourke has always waited for and deserved. Rourke's wait proved to be a success story‚Äîhe succeeded, I mean, in getting the leading role in that independent movie he always wished. His first no‚Äînonsense movie after ¬Ö how many yrs? At least 12‚Äîif we consider BULLET. And did you enjoy the vintage score? I did.<br/><br/>Not only the movie has a style; Rourke's performance does have one, too‚Äîwhatever the similarities, I didn't feel that Rourke was simply 'playing himself'; on the contrary, there's a deployment of artistic intelligence in his play.<br/><br/>After the year with both SIN CITY and DOMINO followed two yrs with almost nothing, and then THE WRESTLER.<br/><br/>I do not say what follows on just because in cinema I swear by Rourke alone; on the contrary, this makes me more exigent towards him. As 'The Ram', Rourke has returned‚Äîhe made again one of those roles that put him on a par with his Brando, with Clift, with Gabin, with Mastroianni and Belmondo‚Äîhis true equals, whom he matched, and more than once, in his career, and now he returns and matches them once more. Yes, Rourke (--finally--) returned and made things better than he did in his youth. Age and experience gave Rourke a certain intelligent detachment; that's felt in his attitude, his performance aims at recovering the humanity of his character. The movie is bleak yet not deprived of a certain sense of‚Äîalmost playfulness, the approach is sure and energetic, yet somehow relaxed. It spares us one‚Äîliners and wisecracks, but the script, the story has depth and meaning. One mention for the beautiful images‚Äîthe movie deploys sense of spaces and of places, but also, as distinct, beauty, eye for the beauty of the surroundings.<br/><br/>Could Rourke surpass himself? I thought I knew everything about him and his acting; THE WRESTLING proved me wrong. He surpassed himself amply. In THE WRSETLER he went beyond and above his own standards. He's more than worthy of our love. Huge actor. Amazing acting. In THE WRESTLER he reached that hugeness and artistic greatness he said, in a French interview in '94, it was his hope to attain to. My adolescence was spent reading everything about Rourke, and seeing all his movies, etc.; I'm more than proud, and more proud than ever, about this. Rourke's THE WRESTLER proved that those who laughed were the clowns. Who made, in the last two decades, such a role in such a profound, meaningful and no‚Äînonsense drama? Crowe, Spacey, Costner, Willis, Gibson, Cruise, Gere, Day‚ÄîLewis, De Niro, Pacino, Depp, Pitt? Where are their performances so true, in flicks ever so impressive? What Hollywoodian actor got such a role, in so serious a movie? Now how do they explain their rubbish? The actors which Rourke loved are now dead‚Äîmost of them‚ÄîGabin, Clift, Brando, Harris, Newman; he is, fully, their successor in art. Yeah, the greatest actor of the generation that counted Gibson, Costner, Willis ¬Ö."

","It's funny to see that almost every film you read about, someone SOMEwhere thinks it's the worst film ever made. ""The Wrestler"" may be the truest film ever made, which is why it's so damn depressing and so good.<br/><br/>Todd Barry, as Wayne, the supermarket manager, was the best, slightly over-the-top PRICK I've seen lately in a film. His performance seemed like something you'd find in ""The Young Ones"", something on the line between believable and unbelievable. That ""The Ram"" had to take crap from this nasty little squid was humiliating. The only consolation was that Wayne was probably as depressed, or more, as Randy.<br/><br/>After the Ram agrees to work behind the deli counter, we see him take the long walk through the employee room, down the stairs, through the warehouse and the plastic curtain where we see him wash his hands. That's what's at the heart of this film, the goodness of Ram's character- he's walking through hell and he washes his hands, like the good person/employee he is. Wearing his ""Robin"" badge. Wow.<br/><br/>At the ""autograph-signing event"", the crowd has died down and the Ram is looking around at the other has-been wrestling stars. The shot ends on the urine bag (or whatever you call it) attached to his fellow's leg. Suicide, anyone? Which really is the point of this film. <br/><br/>The Ram knows his glory days are past and when the doctor tells him that continuing in the ring may kill him, you can see him thinking. What does he have to live for? He's living a life without love, he's past his prime and he's broke. What's the point? When he decides to do the rematch for no $$ is it because he wants to wrestle or because he sees it as the best possible ""out""? <br/><br/>""A little more, a little less, a little more..."". This is a comedic scene but it isn't played for comedy, they play it for real. So, it's funny while you're trying not to kill yourself in recognition of The Ram's crappy reality. It's the message at the heart of the search for security, ""Yay, Im working more hours, I can pay my bills, someone please shoot me, put me out of my misery."" This is why the Ram went into wrestling, to avoid the despair of the ""secure"" life.<br/><br/>Mickey Rourke underplays his whole performance which is why it's so powerful, probably, but the beauty of the film is indicated when Cassidy is giving him a lapdance and he's reminiscing about the old times and dreaming of future possibilities. He's there for her company, not for the minor thrill of having her undulate before him.<br/><br/>Of course, Marisa looks fantastic but God bless her for playing a part where she takes off her clothes and no one is whistling, no one cares. Mickey compliments her on her sexiness as an afterthought; she's bored, he's bored, everybody's just struggling to maintain some self-respect or a positive thought, pay the rent, stay in working shape.<br/><br/>Cassidy's lucky, she has a 9 year old to worry about but The Ram's daughter is old enough to take care of herself; he's just looking for a reason to keep on living.<br/><br/>The visual style of this film, or lack of it, only serves to emphasize the gritty, bleakness of the Ram's meaningless world.<br/><br/>Good film, powerful; not one likely to replace ""It's A Wonderful Life"" as easy inspiration, but inspirational anyway, in it's horrible, ""what do I have to live for?"" fashion."

","Darren Aronofsky's ""The Wrestler"" tells the story of a down and out professional wrestler (Mickey Rourke) who is faced with the prospect of forced retirement due to health problems. In an attempt to establish a new life for himself he reaches out to his estranged daughter (Evan Rachel Wood) and tries to forge a meaningful relationship with his stripper friend, Pam (Marisa Tomei). However, his self-destructive nature continually threatens to undermine his efforts at reformation.<br/><br/>The cast includes a couple of standout performances that were deservedly nominated for Oscars. Mickey Rourke portrays his character with enough humanity to evoke sympathy for a man who is essentially the author of his own misfortune. Marisa Tomei is just as good or better, giving depth to a role that could've easily fallen prey to clich√©. Besides these two, the cast is solid but no-one else really stands out.<br/><br/>Aronofsky's direction is well-handled and doesn't go overboard with style like past efforts (see ""Requiem for a Dream""). Instead, he employs a gritty, realistic feel that bespeaks authenticity. Likewise, the soundtrack, rife with 80's hair metal, suits the subject matter well though it will undoubtedly not appeal to all.<br/><br/>A knowledge of professional wrestling isn't necessary though I suppose that it could enhance your appreciation of the film. The dramatic elements of the story are the focal point, though the lure of entertaining is also vitally important. The film's ending is intentionally ambiguous, which is certain to annoy some, but I think that it was a good choice.<br/><br/>Ultimately, ""The Wrestler"" succeeds due to its thought-provoking storyline and a pair of standout performances. Even if you don't care for wrestling (or sports films, for that matter) this film is well worth your time."

","I hate wrestling. That kept me from watching the flick, despite the good reviews. I'm glad I did finally go for it. The movie makes no defense of professional wrestling, but does show us, behind the scenes, how wrestling really works, that it's all theatrics. The excellent behind-the- scenes look at the wrestling life is one of the best things about the movie. It has been said that the movie is formulaic, and that's true to an extent, but formula is not bad in and of itself, only if it's worked out poorly. In that respect I would say that ""The Ram's"" relationship with his daughter is the weakest part of the film. On the other hand, the analogy between himself and Marisa Tomei's character, a stripper, is very powerful in that they are both people past their prime who are using their bodies for cash (and it's cruel to realize that Tomei is actually 45!). Mickey Rourke's wonderfully understated performance is, in the end, what makes the movie. We see here a good man trying to do his job, his work, the thing that is all he knows how to do. One criticism - the business of shooting the main character from behind throughout the film is an idea that is useful at first but eventually becomes an annoying mannerism. On the whole though, this is a movie that makes us care about the people it portrays."
"kosmasp","9","1","1","27 July 2009"," The Person
","Or you could describe the movie as ""It's not what happens inside a ring that counts"" (no pun intended). And that is because the movie feels more like a documentary following a human being. The action that happens in the ring is secondary (at least to the viewing audience, not for the main character of course). So if you're after watching wrestling action, you're better off watching the wrestling shows on TV rather than this movie.<br/><br/>Or if you have been following the wrestling scene, you also be aware of the documentary ""Beyond the Mat"". A very fine example that movie is and something Darren A. might have seen, before he did this movie. Of course Mickey Rourke and Marisa Tomei both deliver a standout performance, going to (dark) places, to deliver on their characters flaws and strengths. A great drama, that happens to play in the sports department and might be able to open the eyes to some viewers and their prejudice against calling wrestling a sport."

","When 'Sin City' hit the cinemas back in 2005, Mickey Rourke's career was resurrected after an outstanding performance as Marv. Now, under the helm of acclaimed director Darren Aronofsky, Rourke returns in the poignant and brilliant ""The Wrestler"". In his glory days Randy 'The Ram' Robinson (Rourke) was a headlining professional wrestler. Twenty years on, we find Randy wrestling in local communities to smaller crowds. After suffering a major heart attack and forced retirement, Randy decides to seek out his estranged daughter to forge a meaningful relationship, while at the same time the glamour of wrestling has offered him one more match from his glory days pulling him back in to the game.<br/><br/>While there is no myth surrounding the pantomime of wrestling, Aronofsky has sculpted a story combining the broken life of a struggling soul and some of the harsh natures of the sport, to bring us a film about loneliness and second chances. It is clear that Rourke has bought elements of his own turbulent life to the role, where one can often get lost in his amazing performance. The directing and narrative of Aronofsky are flawless, as are the supporting roles, but 'The Wrestler', emotionally driven, unquestionably belongs to Mickey Rourke."

"alain-minsart","9","1","1","14 July 2009"," The academy's biggest mistake of the last decade.
","And that is a true and honest opinion, because one cannot pass by the fact that the most remarkable come-back of the last decade, is the role off Randy 'The Ram' played by the renowned Mickey Rourke. His performance is beyond any classification, most probably because his own history as a washed out actor/sportsman is very similar to the character he is portraying here. Secondly another remarkable come-back may be noted down for Marisa Tomei who shows women around the world that beauty and more likely natural beauty doesn't end after 35. She is at 45 one of the hottest actresses in Hollywood. By far the sexiest one. The movie on itself has a very simplistic story, but in a sense it is that simplicity that brings out the most depth in this story. The story of a man at the brink of his own destruction. Randy is a washed doubt wrestler, once in the 80's a big star in the pro-star Wrestling league, but now twenty years later he is nothing more then a has been, still wrestling in the minor circuit where the young and new up-comers make their appearances and where the old stars are still trying to get back to their once so known fame and respect. And I know it might seem laughable the WWF thing, with the matches all pre-fixed and so on. But the point remains that these men are sportsmen, who put an enormous toll on their bodies, and that is shown throughout the movie. Especially for those who keep on wrestling beyond the point where they should have retired longtime ago. Randy is one of them, he continues to compete in the hopes to get back to the pro-leagues where he was once a big star. Now competing in the obscure circuits, he has no medical treatment or professional following, he needs to seek his salvation in experimental doping drugs that do more damage to his body then they do good. To finance his activities he has been forced to take up a job as a warehouse-worker at the local supermarket. Suffering to make ends meet, he pushes himself to the verge where it almost goes completely wrong. He suffers a stroke and in recovery he finds himself at a crossing in his life, he reflects his relationship with his own estranged daughter, and tries to bring in more depth in his bond with Cassidy (a stripper in the bar he frequents), but he has the heart of a fighter, someone who never backs down in the face of defeat, he doesn't quit, but finally he will have to lose something, and the director brings that dilemma superbly to the screen. U (the viewer) get pulled in to the story, u feel with this poor man, u feel his pains, his indecisiveness, his troubles, u feel sorry for him. And that has been quite a longtime for me to have ever been pulled into a story like that. And oh yes, the final scene or better said the final 5 sec of the movie will pull tears to your eyes. This movie is more then worth the money to rent it, or go watch it in the theater and it is more then recommendable to own it in time. It should not be missing in anyones collection."

The choice of music and realistic style in which the film unfolds is commendable. 8/10 #452 on my list of favorite movies"
"griffinfinity","8","1","1","5 July 2009"," You can't keep a good man down...
","Mickey Rourke is among my very favorite actors. I've seen everything he has done and his body of work is substantial. Several of his performances in the 'old days' should have earned him Oscar nominations. To say he stood as high as any of his peers would be accurate. That said, I do not think that 'The Wrestler' is his best work. It is amongst it though.<br/><br/>The Wrestler is a work that shines in its ability to tell the tale of Randy 'The Ram' Robinson in the gritty fashion that he lived it. The Ram is a survivor of a career that has seen him at the pinnacle and descent from the Professional Wrestling world. He has handled the pain and injuries along the way. He must now grapple with his emotions, a trickier foe in a far more brutal arena.<br/><br/>Rourke portrays two characters here. The first is that of 'The Ram'. All in the VFW halls and locker rooms love him. It is the bottom of the wrestling world in terms of glamor. But the camaraderie is strong, as the wrestlers reminisce about the limelight, the glory days. Inside the ropes, they pummel each other. Outside, there is great pride and friendship. Darren Aronofsky has done a superb job in achieving this sense, along with the real wrestlers taking part in the film.<br/><br/>The other character that Rourke brings to life is that of Robin (""call me Randy""). It is Robin who must tend to the wounds that his alter ego 'The Ram' inflicts. It is Robin who is constantly reminded of the uncomfortable existence it takes to keep 'The Ram' alive. It is time then, for Robin to summon the courage it takes to change things for the better.<br/><br/>Along the way he encounters Marisa Tomei as a kindred soul in need of change as well. Tomei creates 'Pam' a multi-faceted mirror for Robin to peer into. Her ability to blend humor, despair, intelligence and sultriness into the role of Pam is beautiful done. Hers is an integral part in 'The Wrestler'. She pulls it all off in fine fashion and form.<br/><br/>Evan Rachel Wood plays a distant and damaged link to Robin's past. Her contribution to the film is significant, with a capital ""S"". As mentioned, the real life wrestlers assembled for the film are great. Each one has crafted a character for the ring that enables their considerable physical talents to enthrall the local crowds who in turn heap praise upon them. They need each other and Director Aronofsky faithfully depicts that.<br/><br/>Having followed the buzz and accolades awarded the film, director and actors, I feel that they have truly earned it. Watching Mickey's 'official' return to Hollywood, and the publicity it generated made me very happy. I waited to view the film after the hoopla and award galas died down. I was enjoying the Mickey Rourke show too much. The look on Angelina Jolie's face as Rourke kissed her hand at an awards show said it all. For that moment in time, the man standing beside her, Brad Pitt, did not exist. Rourke's charisma survived the ups and downs of a harsh life that Rourke admitted was of his own doing.<br/><br/>I think the side story, that of the resurgence of Mickey Rourke is every bit as interesting as 'The Wrestler'. Rourke was nothing if not astounding, brilliant in films such as 'Rumblefish', and 'The Pope of Greenwich Village'. The success continued and then, it seemed as if Mickey disappeared. Often times, that is the case in Hollywood when one doesn't follow the script. What happened? It can be explained in three simple words, ""Royalty in Exile""."
"Chance2000esl","9","1","1","29 June 2009"," One of the Best Sports Movies Ever Made!
","This is one of the best sports movies ever made. But 'Rocky' (1976) it's not. It's a graphic, realistic film shot in documentary style about an aging wrestler confronting his mortality and his failed life at the end of his career (""20 Years Later""), and near his own end.<br/><br/>As a long time wrestling fan, when I received the DVD, I clicked on selected scenes first-- awfully graphic and depressing. I didn't think I'd want to sit and watch the whole movie, but the next day I made the time to view it, and was rewarded for having done so. It's an expertly crafted film with outstanding performances, and an intelligent, respectful treatment of its themes.<br/><br/>First of all, it doesn't seem like a movie, because it's shot like a documentary-- the use of hand held cameras that show or follow behind Mickey Roarke (as Robin who wrestles as 'Randy the Ram'); the fast paced editing and jumps in time and place; and hardly any music at all (hints of 'Dogma 95'), so that many of the silences, (including Ram's continual heavy exhaling) can speak volumes about isolation, loneliness, and having to live with who you are and what you've become. For over 90% of the movie, it's a real suspension of disbelief -- we think we're watching the real thing! <br/><br/>Thankfully, we didn't have Nicholas Cage in the part, then we'd know it's a movie, seeing him doing his pained acting schtick, so wonderfully parodied by John Travolta as him in 'Face/Off' (1997). Totally unrecognizable as 'Mickey Roarke, the Actor', Roarke stole the movie 'Sin City' (2005), and he's even better here. You believe he is Ram because he looks so appropriately old, puffy and wasted, and he's clearly speaking from the heart. This is not the sweet faced actor Mickey Roarke from the 80s and 90s; here he looks and is the real deal. A great acting job.<br/><br/>The film is about getting old. We see this throughout the film. Marissa Tomei plays Pam, who uses the 'stage name' Cassidy as an almost too old pole and lap dancer (""You're as old as my mother!"" one customer yells) who's confronting her own choices about aging. Although we know it's her acting in a movie, her character is reality based and convincing, as she tries to follow the number one rule of the sex trade: ""Don't get personally involved with customers!"" Their two lives parallel all during the film, with both of them choosing a different path at the end.<br/><br/>The film is so intelligently and respectfully constructed. We see images of time passed by every where-- Ram's trailer is full of audio cassettes; he plays an ancient Nintendo game (specially made for the movie!) with a young boy who says, ""This game is so old!""; he sells old VHS tapes at wrestling events; he even drives an old Dodge Ram; and in a fantastic and poignant scene he talks, walks and dances with his daughter in an old, empty, deserted amusement park, and of course, there's Randy's 20 Years Later rematch with 'The Ayatollah,' a symbol of anti-Iran feelings of the 1980s.<br/><br/>And why does the scene with Randy's daughter, Stephanie, (Evan Rachel Wood in a great mini performance) angrily banishing him from her life seem so familiar? As noted in IMDb, it clearly parallels, and in fact is taken from, Jake 'The Snake' Roberts' painful meetings with the daughter he forgot in the wrestling documentary 'Beyond the Mat' (1999).<br/><br/>The reality of the professional 'kayfabe' wrestling world is shown in fast paced documentary style, (and even includes the garbage wrestling of CZW) with Randy the Ram, actually Mickey Roarke (!), being a combination of Hulk Hogan and Randy Savage (both 80s icons).<br/><br/>And what does it all mean? After having suffered a near fatal heart attack, Randy retires and gets a job working in a deli. He tries to repair his personal life with Cassidy and Stephanie, but fails. Tired of being a mousy deli clerk, even denying who he is to a customer, he decides to do the Ayatollah rematch, even at the risk of a fatal heart attack. Having lost everything else, in the ring he declares how his life in the ring constituted the real meaning of who and what he is. As he feels and hears the piercing whine that signalled the first heart attack, he decides to go for it anyway, and performs his Ram Jam dive off the top rope to------ oops! the movie ends there! It's not just as you sow so shall ye reap; or what goes around comes around. As Dylan Thomas said, ""Rage, rage against the dying of the light!"" You've got to boldly be who you are.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 9 and 1/2. One of the greatest sports movies ever made!"

","A solid movie, ""The Wrestler"" has a sort of docudrama feel with the hand-held type camera work and the situations and settings. Mickey Rourke as Randy the Ram lives a truly pathetic life as a washed up wrestler. He feels alone and has almost no family. I enjoyed his romance with Pam (Marisa Tomei) the table-dancer. Both seem to want a little more normalcy out of life, but it's hard to break through stereotypes and expectations. One of the better scenes in the movie featured them at a bar reminiscing. The movie exemplifies the staleness and obsolescence relating to age and aging. The feeling and despair when youth passes us by - when you're better days were in the past. Although the father/daughter relationship feels too glossed over, the movie works well. I didn't particularly like the sporadic jerky camera movement, but it's a minor issue. Worth a watch."

","The finest cinema experience derives itself from the well of dilution of reality and fantasy, actor and role, scene and surroundings. It is the paramount necessity for immersion of the moviegoer in the sights and sounds of a 2 hour story on screen¬Ö immersion beyond the shallow depths ‚Äì immersion so deep as to leave the experience dripping from the lips, running off the fingers¬Ö the viewer awash in a tale that soaked thru to the heart.<br/><br/>Romantic indulgences aside, The Wrestler with Mickey Rourke is the latest entry into the ""Success"" column of said requirements. Without a doubt, it is far less a movie featuring an actor so very well skilled in his craft as it is the camera-held vista into the crushing world of an ex-warrior no longer able to take a steady step into a single minute of his remaining days. Bleached blonde, steroid-enhanced, tanned and toting every ounce of machismo as could be mined in any given biker weekend, Randy ""The Ram"" lives in the shadows of his once glorious wrestling career. He has no family save a daughter that hates him. He has no true friends but those that depend on him for small appearances or drug supplies. He has nothing but a van and constant struggles with landlords to keep from sleeping in it. His story is one of greatness lost that is mesmerizing to watch. It is a story normally overlooked by people who pass those like Randy by at the end of a bar with complete indifference... but within Randy's life is a search for redemption. He knows he is better than the gutter and fights blindly to recapture the light and it is there that the movie becomes spectacular. And as the story unfolds, the keen viewer soon realizes that it concerns not just the comeback of a down-but-not-out ""Ram""; it is the resurrection of a great actor. It could be (and has been) said that Mickey Rourke, a once-promising A-list actor whose 80's career high spiraled into a near-endless series of bad movies (and a brief stint in boxing), brought much of his own personal tale of redemption into this role. It could be said that his usual self-assured swagger simply worked well in this role. It could be said that he lucked into the once-in-a-lifetime performance not to be duplicated. A lot could be said. What WILL be said is that he is a master. The pain, emotional and physical, across his face is a torment that strikes again and again until the tale is told. Going in knowing fully well who the lead actor was, I almost found myself searching the credits to confirm it. He is truly that mesmerizing¬Ö the complete dilution of reality and fantasy. A truly fine actor. Accompanying Mickey is Marisa Tomei. Picasso had his Blue Period, Monet had that spell with water lilies, and raven-haired Academy Award Winning Miss Tomei continues to indulge her bad girl streak. Teased with in Slums of Beverly Hills, stereotypically indulged in Wild Hogs (a 'movie' I hesitate to mention at all), it is deftly honed to hurt perfection here. Wild and woolly in the club ""The Ram"" frequents, she absolutely shatters perceptions when she accepts his invitation to a 'date' and shows up in daylight as a tender, bundled-up woman both more vulnerable and smarter than the initial ""looking for bills"" sneers her profession demands. She is the anchor that steadies a Randy adrift¬Ö she is the face that brings calm throughout the whirlwind of encounters he stumbles through. And he, in turn, gives her a much-needed gift for her efforts - respect. One of the better cinematic relationships forged. The best I've seen in years. Go in watching The Wrestler with the expectation that it will be an indulgent, moody independent flick that will leave you dull and sour. Go out refreshed with the gift of a glimpse into the life of people downed by the world but not defeated. People choosing to define themselves against the labels of an indifferent society. People triumphant. <br/><br/>And one final note in Mr. Rourke's favor, again¬Ö Hollywood politics alone kept him from getting the Academy Award this past year. His performance is truly one for the ages."

","Being an admirer of Darren Aronofsky's (Requiem for a Dream, Pi) films, I decided to give this a watch before all the Oscar hype and whatnot. I wasn't particularly familiar with Mickey Rourke so I did not expect much. Now, don't get this film wrong. Just because it's about a wrestler does not mean the plot revolves around the sport or whatnot. This film is about life itself. Think along the lines of Gran Torino. <br/><br/>Having said that, I was pleasantly surprised and significantly impressed by Mickey Rourke's portrayal of immensely popular yet burnt-out professional wrestler Randy 'The Ram' Robinson who is past his prime and coming to terms with it. After suffering a career-stopping heart attack, he decides to retire and end his wrestling days for good. Slowly, his life spirals downward exacerbated by the strained relationship with his estranged daughter - portrayed by Evan Rachel Wood - and only comforted by a similarly burnt-out past-prime stripper - played by Marisa Tomei - he regularly shares intimate conversations and moments with.<br/><br/>This film is very straight-forward and gives the viewer a perspective of Randy 'The Ram' Robinson's life. Although you may not think so, I am vehemently sure more than a few of us have been through (or currently going through) this stage of life he's experiencing where it feels like the whole world is against you.<br/><br/>Extremely gritty, brutal, intriguing, jarring and unequivocally familiar, The Wrestler takes us on a journey about life itself and how important bonds and relationships are and how a slight deterioration in either can lead to a very depressing phase for anyone. The most peculiar and unique feature of this film is that when you watch it, you really feel for Randy. It's not overly emotional or unnecessarily depressing but more of a subtle and poignant rendition. To say that this film made my eyes watery is a shrewd understatement but to say that it made me bawl is an exaggeration. This is one of the rare films which is in between those emotional reactions. It's heartwarming in some parts while shockingly vulgar in others. Vivid and gnarly, this film should appeal to any moviegoer and for those who methodically analyze and dissect films, this one should be a definite keeper. <br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky has succeeded in banding Mickey Rourke, Marisa Tomei and Evan Rachel Wood into a wonderful concoction of talent and stellar performances. I am quite disappointed that the Oscars jumped on the hype of Slumdog Millionaire instead of considering this film which I believe should have won Best Picture hands down. <br/><br/>Nonetheless, I'm very sure you will enjoy this film and highly recommend it.<br/><br/>Two thumbs up!"
"st-shot","8","1","1","30 March 2009"," Art imitates life in The Wrestler
","The Wrestler is a scrappy independent with a well worn look about it that features a towering performance by the worse for wear Mickey Rourke as an over the hill grappler long past his prime. Rourke an 80's sex symbol (9 1/2 Weeks)made a career change to professional boxing in the 90s and has been considered washed up for some time until now. Gone are the movie star looks and brimming self confidence replaced now with a weathered and battered (the creation of good punches and bad plastic surgery)face that ideally fits the character of Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson, has been wrestler.<br/><br/>The Ram who used to pack arenas is now in the twilight of his career picking up matches when he can for lighter payoffs that allow him to catch up on his rent at the trailer park. When he suffers a near fatal heart attack after a graphically bloody fight that includes staple guns he is left with few options. He attempts to readjust by getting a job at a supermarket deli, reconnecting with his daughter and making a go of it with a stripper(Marisa Tomei)but the promise of all are dashed by Randy's inability to adjust normally outside the ring. So it's back to the canvas one more time for a highly publicized good payday match.<br/><br/>Rourke has at least a half dozen powerful scenes that are truly moving. Realizing he's been a screw up in everything but wrestling he clumsily tries to make a go of it with a daughter that's bitter but willing to give him one more chance and the aging dancer who is faced with a similar situation. Tomei as Cassidy and Evan Rachel Wood as his daughter chip in with fine emotionally real performances that don't hesitate to call Randy out on past and present transgressions.<br/><br/>Director Aron Aronofsky establishes ""The Ram's"" bleak situation early but balances the story throughout by injecting a good deal of dark humor into situations. It doesn't move as maniacally as his Requiem for a Dream but there is some fine use of hand held camera-work and some striking compositions such as when he is retrieving his van after being released from the hospital that serve as perfect metaphor. Like Requiem he refuses the easy way out with his story<br/><br/>Since it's a well traveled theme there's a little clich√© and a lot of gratuitous violence in the Wrestler but Rourke along with able assists from Tomei and Wood convincingly convey the daunting melancholia of being worn down by life."
"DonFishies","8","1","1","22 February 2009"," A legendary performance in a dirty, gritty film
","Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson (Mickey Rourke) is an aging wrestler who has seen better days. He was a huge star in the 1980s, but is merely reliving his glory days through the independent circuit now. He still has his fans, but things are obviously not the same as they were. He is relegated to living in a shoddy trailer home he can barely afford, and his only real emotional connection is through a stripper, Cassidy (Marisa Tomei) he has to pay in order to talk to.<br/><br/>To say that this is Rourke's comeback film is an understatement. This film is a resurrection. He was barely recognizable under all the makeup and special effects wizardry in his excellent performance in Frank Miller's Sin City, and he is almost as unrecognizable here without the makeup. He transforms himself into The Ram, and makes a fool out of anyone that said he could never pull off a great performance again. This performance is the stuff of legend, and is almost miraculous in how it was pulled off.<br/><br/>Rourke plays the character with just enough desperation and heartbreak it needs. Sure, it helps that the character is so close in ties to what Rourke had become, but giving it that personal touch gives the film a certain aura of authenticity that it needs to truly be believable. If the filmmakers had picked someone else, it is doubtful they could have given this role the heart and intensity that Rourke does. He knows this character, and he puts an immense amount of effort into bringing him to life. Watching him prepping for a match, coming out of a match as a bloody mess, sitting at a ""convention"" with his aged memorabilia, or just seeing him attempt to be a part of regular society is just heartbreaking. He looks and feels alienated, and seeing this look on the hulking face of Rourke gives the film and the character a whole new meaning. This is someone who had it all, threw it away and now has to deal with the consequences. But fortunately enough, the outlook is a whole lot more positive for Rourke than it is for The Ram.<br/><br/>But not all the praise for this miraculous transformation should go to Rourke.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky does just as much, if not more to make this film as heartbreakingly real as he does. The amount of personal devotion to this film is amazing. Along with Cinematographer by Maryse Alberti and Editor Andrew Weisblum, Aronofsky has created a down and dirty independent picture about a down and dirty business. It is gritty and unflinching when it comes to portraying the risks wrestlers go through to provide blood-thirsty fans a piece of entertainment for the night. And these are not even the types found in the more commonly seen WWE-style matches on television. These are the amateur circuits, where anything goes and the money made is not always worth it. The low angled shots and filthy atmospheres are presented with such a look that you may wonder if you are not actually watching a documentary. It is that real, and that authentic looking.<br/><br/>Sometimes, the film gets so real that it may be hard to take. I know I grimaced more than once at the gritty way Aronofsky shot the matches we see early on in the film. A weapons-laden match I would have clamored for as a kid looks downright disgusting and vile now. The film is laden with these sorts of in-your-face gruesome shots, but it shows the reality of what this lifestyle is like and the pains these people have to put up with in the name of entertainment. The reality is painful, and just terrifying in some instances. And made all the worse by the knowledge that this film is based in reality and is not entirely fictional.<br/><br/>While there are many supporting characters, the only ones who get any real time to do anything are Tomei and Wood. Tomei is great in her role, and continues to prove that My Cousin Vinny was not a fluke. Her character is going through the same has-been mentality that Rourke's is, and you can see the saddened, sullied look in her face throughout the film. Her character craves more, but is unfortunately stuck in a rut she cannot get out of. She is clearly overshadowed by the powerhouse Rourke is, but she holds her own anyway. Wood on the other hand, is merely just good. Many of her films have been about misunderstood and ignored children, but her heart does not seem to be totally into this role. She gets very little screen time, and much of it is highly emotional, but she just does not have the chops to complement Rourke. She has done much better work in the past.<br/><br/>The film is also dragged down by a lengthy running time. This is a blazingly paced movie, but scenes that come late in the film feels misplaced, and almost entirely unneeded. We understand The Ram from the moment the movie starts; we do not need even more additional tidbits. It borders on overkill, and frequently feels a bit draggy. It is a problem that has plagued many movies from 2008, but while it does not destroy the film like it does in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, it does not help it much either.<br/><br/>The film is far from perfect, but is an excellent nonetheless. Rourke's performance is nothing short of amazing. If he had not proved his worth as an actor before, he has more than proved himself now. This is memorable and legendary work that will not soon be forgotten.<br/><br/>8/10."

","As I was watching ""The Wrestler"" I was already trying to determine what I would rate it on a five star scale. Three or four stars? Certainly not five. The first 40 minutes left me wanting more and hoping the movie got better. Don't get me wrong, Rourke was great in the film's entirety as was Marisa Tomei. I cannot fault the acting in this movie at all. (Except for Evan Rachel Wood. I found she did a bit too much over acting and came off as melodramatic as she always does.) While this certainly wasn't a bad movie and it was well acted and well written it was awfully paced. Perhaps I'm just not an Aronofksy fan as I found ""Requiem for A Dream"" had the same problem - Excellent acting, horrible pacing. (I have yet to see his other films - ""The Fountain"" being one I'd really like to see.) I should also note that in parts it felt like every other art house flick to have come out in the past ten years or so.<br/><br/>Having said all of that, I didn't dislike this movie and I do enjoy films that feel more independent. I don't regret having watched it. I just expected something more. Rourke definitely deserves to win the Academy award for his performance."

If I could separate the rating of the movie I would give it (the movie) a 7 and Mickey Rourke a 10.<br/><br/>I must say the Mickey Rourke I saw in this movie has altered his appearance considerably since I last saw him.

His performance as The Wrestler is music sweet music - specifically, 1980s hair metal. Not only does he pull the shameless Oscar Moments (""I'm a broken-down piece of meat"" - you've seen the trailers), he also does the most natural on screen acting since the 1970s (think: JAWS or THE EXORCIST) - and that's him in the ring, performing all his wrestling stunts himself. <br/><br/>A triple-threat performance so remarkable *should* be rewarded - even if it's just the political hokum of the Academy Awards. <br/><br/>THE WRESTLER opens with posters of wrestler, Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson (Rourke), in a montage of his glamorous, storied career, while Quiet Riot's ""Bang Your Head"" slams at the soundtrack; some posters feature his watershed bout with ""The Ayatollah"" at Madison Square Garden. <br/><br/>Crash-cut to 20 years later in a lonely dressing room after an exhibition match, with Randy accepting a light pay packet (the usual managerial excuse ""Not as many people as I thought""). He is down but not out, long dyed-blond locks, long in the tooth, long past his Use By date, yet punishing his body in small matches for small pay. <br/><br/>""Well I'm frustrated, outdated...""<br/><br/>With a Steadicam following so close behind him we can hear his labored breathing and count the wrinkles on his puffy, battered face, our first intimate adventure with Randy is him being locked out of his trailer (for late rent) after returning from a match, eventually sleeping in his Dodge van. <br/><br/>Some glamour. <br/><br/>""I really wanna be over-rated.""<br/><br/>Aronofsky is intent on showing us the side of this vocation farthest from the bright lights and the crowd roar, following Randy so closely we almost get a steroid high from breathing in the stank of his sweaty, bloody tights; blonding his hair, tanning his hide, doping on painkillers, buying a sweater for his estranged daughter... <br/><br/>He makes time at a strip club with stripper, Cassidy (Marisa Tomei) who - ironically - doesn't treat him like a slab of meat, and though they share a few tender moments, she forces herself to regard him as ""just a customer."" And though we know he feels for Cassidy - not least because she spends so much time rubbing her firm naked ta-tas against his brickhouse biceps in private dances - he keeps up that tough man-facade...<br/><br/>""I'm a finder and I'm a keeper; I'm not a loser and I ain't no weeper.""<br/><br/>Mickey Rourke has always had a body carved from unyielding rock; a background in boxing and self-abuse has brought him this wrestler's meat-muscle frame. The Wrestler IS Mickey Rourke. Though something seems very ""wrong"" and misshapen about that steamtrain frame, like it is being driven by will alone and one misstep will implode it.<br/><br/>Randy is obviously the oldest still on the circuit, yet the camaraderie of the wrestler brotherhood is apparent - backstage, they all give him the respect he has earned.

","Wrestling has always seemed a bit of a bother to me with no real sense of direction or purpose whenever I accidentally catch a glance of it while flipping channels. Here, in Darren Aronofsky's powerful and effective film tribute, I can say with sincerity that I have grown to somewhat appreciate the sacrifice and dedication these guys go through, despite the shear ridiculousness of it all.<br/><br/>In what is assuredly one of the finest performances of this or any other year, Mickey Rourke, the big, bold and intimidating actor best known for cheap bits in dirty and skanky low-budget flicks, breathes life into the body of Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson, an aging wrestler whose once-bright star from the 1980s flickered out some time ago. Yet, here he is, in the opening scene, in a grade school classroom slowly unwrapping is beat-up body for chicken feed. His personal life is just as dismal with the only real relationship he can experience being that with an over-the-hill, non committed stripper Cassidy, played with remarkable reflection and sincerity by the wonderful Marisa Tomei. She is ready to quit yet can't seem to truly walk away from a job that is thankless and depraving at the same time. The other strained but faint relationship is that with Randy and his estranged daughter Stephanie, in maybe the best performance by Evan Rachel Wood. She is a self-made young woman, completely ready to face the world on her own as she grew up that way. Then, her father comes back into her life and she is angry, confused and unsure of how to deal with this situation.<br/><br/>To wrap this review up, I must conclude by saying that Mickey Rourke will win you over with this performance as will Marisa Tomei and Evan Rachel Wood. the intimate scenes are by far more gripping and intense than the wrestling scenes. These still are completely immersible and build for one great climactic moment. All in all this is a tough and gritty story about a tough and gritty man who lives for the thrill of the moment and has to reconcile with the fact that this may be done . Yes, it is a clich√© story, but when it is so well-handled by Aronofsky and the three lead actors are mesmerizing, you can't help but be moved and astounded."

","Randy ""Ram"" (Mickey Rourke) was a superstar in the world of professional wrestling, where all of the moves are choreographed and blows are ""faked"". Now, 20 years later, Randy is still at it, but his arenas are a lot smaller. All of the muscle-enhancing drugs, accidental injuries, late hours and the like have taken a heavy toll on the ""Ram"" and he has a bad ticker. Consequently, Randy appears in two-bit shows and his pay is comparatively low. On the Jersey shore, he lives in a rundown trailer park, where the owner locks him out of his own home if the rent is late. Nevetheless, Ram still tries to keep his long, flowing blonde locks touched up at the beauty salon and he visits the tanning salons, too, to keep that healthy, robust ""look"". Mostly a loner, Randy is trying to acquire more permanent interpersonal connections. His long-neglected daughter (Evan Rachel Wood) lives nearby and dad is trying to patch things up with her, although she is still harboring a great deal of resentment toward him. In addition, Randy has fallen for a local stripper, Cassidy (Marisa Tomei) who, like him, is getting to old to continue her line of work but who has her eyes on a dream home in a nice Jersey suburb. Cassidy, also, resists his advances, saying continually that she doesn't get involved with ""clients"". Sad. Now, after a horrific local battle, where Ram is bloodied and stapled, he ends up in the hospital where doctors tell him he MUST leave the wrestling business or he will end up taking a dirt bath. Will he find a new direction in life? This is a terrific film, but so monumentally sad that I cried buckets. As a person who knew nothing of the world of professional wrestling, my eyes were opened to the horrors of a ""sport"" where fans dictate the dance steps and the wrestlers, despite receiving some fame, brutally abuse their bodies and their minds. As Randy, Rourke is so wonderful that his performance easily towers over almost everyone else's in cinema this year. His tough but touching turn is the stuff of legends. Likewise, Tomei is pretty amazing, too, in her role as a dancing stripper, and not only because she still looks great. Wood and all of the other supporting cast members fulfill their roles nicely, too. The seedy venues, the outrageous costumes and the great camera work present a penetrating look into the world of wrestling and should be lauded as well. As for the script and direction, they are topnotch and illuminating, too. In brief, don't miss The Wrestler, for it shines a harsh light on the ""athletes"" caught up in the tawdry universe of professional wrestling and, indeed, of the poorer echelons of society. But, be prepared to pass the tissue box around, as they say, when you sit down for a view."

","The Wrestler is much more than just a movie about wrestling. It's a movie about real people in fake worlds (wrestling for Rourke, stripping for Tomei). It's also about loss, lost relationships, lost youth and a lost soul.<br/><br/>Rourke's performance is what everyone has been talking about. After watching The Wrestler I can safely say that it's as good as advertised. Rourke became the character. Tomei also delivered a strong supporting performance as the stripper Cassidy. Evan Rachel Wood was great in her limited use as Rourkes bitter daughter Stephanie.<br/><br/>The way the wrestling world is portrayed is dead on. It showed you the bond between the wrestlers backstage and how the shows are run. It shows you the dark side of wrestling (steroid use, drug addictions etc.) This movie did it's homework and that made it even better.<br/><br/>The ending is so simple yet so emotional. The entire movie is that way, simple but emotional. The academy made a huge mistake not nominating this for best picture, I hope Rourke wins the award and shows the academy what a real performance is. Stay for the credits to hear Bruce Springsteen's song made solely for the film. You won't regret it."

","The underdog and the comeback are the staples of the sports movie genre, from The Champ to Rudy, even Mr. Baseball, and The Wrestler is no different. However, this time, the plucky challengers fighting against the odds and one-time heroes looking to get back on top are the off-screen stories, rather than on.<br/><br/>Mickey Rourke plays the wrestler in question: a washed-up, battered one-time 80's icon considered past his prime by anyone who cares to remember him, a character so close to Rourke's own real-life story of a career self-destructed by drugs, fights and bad decisions that almost from the beginning of the film, the line between how much of the performance is an act and how much is real becomes blurred. You will have heard a lot in the media about his comeback role as Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson, a former professional wrestling star now working for a pittance on the independent circuit, forced to live in a trailer park and make ends meet by manning the deli at a supermarket, and it is well deserved, but if you're looking for an equally uplifting story on-screen, you've come to the wrong place. Although Randy dreams of one day stepping back into the ring for the big leagues, this ain't no Rocky. Randy is a ""broken down piece of meat"", not a contenduh, and there isn't much in the way of character arcs or sentimental scenes of triumph or overcoming adversity, but that is what one should expect from director Darren Aronofsky, he who directed the unrelenting, freaky- deaky Requiem For A Dream.<br/><br/>If Rourke is the comeback, then Aronofsky is the underdog of this particular sports-movie clich√©. After the critical mauling that met his criminally misunderstood The Fountain, he seems to have dismissed the overly cinematic flourishes and visual embellishments that have marked his work so far and gone in the complete opposite direction, creating a small, low- budget character study, with the focus being on the atmosphere and sense of place, and it is this aspect in which The Wrestler scores on every level. His hand-held camera follows Rourke from shabby school gyms and grubby community centers to seedy strip joints (where Randy meets his favorite stripper and the only person who understands him, Cassidy, played winningly and with great naturalism by her of the perennial heart-of-gold, Marissa Tomei) and, of course, into the wrestling ring, which is captured perfectly. As Rourke and his fellow wrestlers (all played by real-life independent professionals) leap off ladders into barbed wire-tables and bounce off the ropes into a body-crunching move from their opponent, you can't help but pity them. Randy's limited self-worth and belief that it is all he can do have driven him to this. The authenticity that Aronofsky captures works wonders in enhancing Mickey Rourke's already moving performance, but to his credit, Rourke never allows the film to become a downer. It may seem like an easy performance for him, as Randy is characterized by the grotesque physical features (the swollen face, the leathery, fake-tanned skin) that define Rourke himself, but with his self-deprecating sense of humour he comes across as a likable chump while a lesser actor (such as the studio's terrible first choice for the role, Nicholas Cage) may have used the excuse to emote and ""act"".<br/><br/>However, not everything operates on this level. The script, in particular, is predictable and contains some awkward moments (particularly when Randy goes and sees his estranged daughter, played by Evan Rachel Wood who, to her credit, almost overcomes the clunky dialogue written for her). The story is merely a stage on which to display Rourke and Aronofsky's work, but even the director himself makes some bad decisions. When Randy walks through the back of the supermarket, about to walk through the plastic curtains onto the deli counter, did we really need the dubbed-over crowd noise to understand the parallel between this and Randy walking backstage at a wrestling show? However, such faults are minor compared to the film's achievements. Randy The Ram may be a ""one-trick pony"", but The Wrestler is definitely a contender.<br/><br/>To see more of this review, or more reviews of other films, visit:<br/><br/>jacksfilmblog at blogspot.com"
"MidnightRambler21","8","1","1","3 February 2009"," Rourke brings his A-game to his role as a washed up former wrestling star in Darren Aronofsky's terrific ""The Wrestler""
","***1/2 (out of 4)<br/><br/>Watching Darren Aronofsky's new film, The Wrestler, it is hard to ignore the parallels between Mickey Rourke's character, Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson, and Rourke's personal life. Randy, whose real name is Robin Ramsinki, is a washed up former wrestling star. A self-proclaimed ""old broken down piece of meat,"" Randy pumps his body full of steroids and takes hard beatings during poorly-attended small venue matches, while moonlighting at a grocery store. He is repeatedly locked out of his trailer for failing to pay his rent, and he hasn't seen his daughter in years.<br/><br/>Rourke, a former A-lister during the '80's, fell out of the game within a decade due to substance abuse and unpredictability on set. He briefly held a stint as a professional boxer and played bit parts in straight-to-video releases. In the 2000's, Rourke experienced a small resurgence as he played small rolls in films such as Once Upon A Time in Mexico, Sin City, and Domino. With The Wrestler, Rourke's makes his full come-back as a major performer; and what a damn fine performance it is.<br/><br/>Rourke brings a tremendous physicality to the role. His performance in the ring is incredibly disciplined and powerful. At one point he uses a hidden razor to cut his own forehead ¬ñ a spectacle for the cheering crowd. According to a TV interview, Rourke insisted on actually cutting himself during the scene, foregoing any special effects. His performance outside the ring, though, is equally impressive. He expertly enacts an emotionally complex role, the disparity manifested on his worn features. You can't help but feel sorry for the guy. <br/><br/>Randy, in life, is painfully alone. Though he seems to know everyone in the wrestling crowd, you get the feeling that nobody knows him at all; talking to former champion Randy ""The Ram,"" rather than Randy, the person. He lives alone in a worn-down trailer, re-enacting his glory days on an old Nintendo wrestling game. When he suffers a heart attack, after an intensely brutal match, a doctor essentially informs him that his wrestling days are over. <br/><br/>Randy's only real relationship is with a stripper whose real name is Pam, but who performs under the name Cassidy (superbly played by Marisa Tomei); and this relationship may not be as genuine as he would hope. Though Randy is clearly more than just another customer to her, he pays for his lap dances just like everyone else. It is Cassidy who suggests that he get in contact with his estranged daughter. <br/><br/>Perhaps appropriately, (but unfortunately) for a film interested in the ""fake"" sport of wrestling, Randy's relationship with his daughter Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood) sometimes rings false. Though Wood is a very fine actor and does the most with her part, the attempted reconciliation is rushed, clich√©d and, at worst, melodramatic. This small flaw is forgivable though, as Robert D. Siegal's script, Aronofsky's direction, and Rourke and Tomei's performances are so exceptional. <br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky, the man responsible for 2000's triumph, Requiem for a Dream, but also the 2006 flop, The Fountain, proves himself as more than a one-trick pony with The Wrestler. The film is gritty, and possesses a realism that feels almost like a fly-on-the-wall documentary. The small touches he brings ¬ñ including an extraordinary scene in which Randy, traveling to the deli counter at his new job, hears the increasingly present roars of an imaginary crowd cheering him on ¬ñ assert an individuality that is very much welcome. On his A-game, Aronofsky proves himself as one of America's most talented young directors. We will wait eagerly to see what he comes up with next."
"Sparrowmaniac","8","1","1","31 January 2009"," Rourke's return ticket to Hollywood
","Lets cut to the chase. The Wrestler is a 100% Micky Rourke movie. He is on screen for more than 95% of the movie. And Darren Aronofsky has shot the movie in a third person perspective. We are almost all the time following Rourke along. Its the story of a beaten down ex A-List Wrestler, a top entertainer. We have an inside look in the wrestling business. The pain that one has to endure, push their bodies to the limits, day in and day out, to earn a few hundred dollars.<br/><br/>Right from the first scene, we see Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson, hunched over after a gruelling night of wrestling, disappointed that his pay is less than usual. He goes to his worn down trailer to see that the owner of the trailer park has locked it up because he his late for his payments. We see him struggling through day jobs and weekend pay-per- views, and try and fix his relationship with his daughter. But like everything else his life starts going spiralling down. He collapses after a particularly brutal match and is diagnosed with a bypass surgery. After that we see, him getting frustrated at his life in general, he cant date the woman he loves, his daughter hates him and he cant wrestle. In the end he decides to come back to wrestle, come what may be the consequence, because as he puts it, ""You(the fans) are my true and only family. And I will continue till the day my body goes on, and until you people stay I', done for good!""<br/><br/>The movie is not about a comeback, per se. Because, we really doesn't come back to his former glory, and its more of a symbolic gesture. But its got very good moral values. Micky Rourke is extraordinary, and he pulls together a stupendous performance, come awards functions, he will be a very strong contender for the Best Actor performance. This movie also gives us an insight to the wrestling business, and being a wrestling fan for many years, I have a biased view of the movie, but it still is awesome. You see how much of its real, and the pain that the professional wrestlers have to endure, their battering bodies. Its truly extraordinary. Marisa Tomei is also impressive in her role as the stripper who is a good friend of ""The Ram"". We see how their relationship evolves along the movie, her dilemma to get into a relationship with a ""customer"". Evan Rachael Wood is also good in her very small role as Randy's daughter. But like I said in the very beginning, this movie is all about Mickey Rourke, nobody else comes close to steal his glory at the end. A well deserved 8/10!"
"Rogue-32","9","1","1","31 January 2009"," No Holds Barred
","If you're familiar with Darren Aronofsky, you know that he makes balls-out, no-holds-barred films, from the outrageous ""Pi"" to the gut-wrenching ""Requiem For A Dream"" to the epic scope and profound power of ""The Fountain"", so it's no surprise that his fourth feature film, ""The Wrestler"", follows in this unflinching tradition.<br/><br/>And if you, like me, enjoy his kind of film-making, you will certainly appreciate this incredibly intense character study. It's the story of Randy (ne Robin) ""The Ram"" Robinson , a hugely successful professional wrestler who is well past his prime but still hanging on to the only life he's ever known ~ the glory of what happens in The Ring.<br/><br/>Mickey Rourke is our Randy, and he's the perfect choice, the only choice. Let's face it, the film wouldn't have really worked with, say, Stallone or Pacino or Steve Buscemi in the role. Rourke has been a boxer, in the '90s, he's lived this sort of life (and has even talked about trying professional wrestling in the future ¬ñ with Rourke, it could very well happen). He knows this character from the inside, and every bit of that hard-earned knowledge explodes onto the screen.<br/><br/>The film lives or dies on the basis of the believability of this performance, and I'm here to tell you he is so credible that you might sometimes forget you're watching an actor, he's buried so deep within the soul of the character. Whether we see him with his grungy dirty blond hair in a restrained bun, trying to live a 'normal' existence - trying to reconcile his broken relationship with his daughter Stephanie (another completely believable performance from the great Evan Rachel Wood), trying to forge some sort of meaningful bond with stripper Marisa Tomei (in a deeply heartfelt ¬ñ and sexy- performance), trying to fit into a new gig behind the deli counter of a super market ¬ñ or with his hair down, getting pounded to a pulp in the ring, we feel it. We feel his regret, his frustration, his hopefulness, his pain, we live it with him; this is a genuine tour de force for Rourke, and I wouldn't be surprised if he comes up from behind and takes Best Actor on 2/22/09."
"zdm88","8","1","1","30 January 2009"," Definitely Worth Seeing
","Personally, when I saw Darren Aronofsky was in the making of a new movie, I knew it was going to be good. He is a virtuoso in the art of film-making. I figured this movie was going to be similar to his emotion-driven art films. It was actually the exact opposite. This movie was as real as it looks. Every single line is made to be real and not clich√©d or exaggerated. Now as far as the acting goes, Mickey Rourke definitely stole the show. For me, his performance made the movie great. I wanted to see this movie when I first read about it one year ago, and it was as gritty and as true to life as I envisioned it. Marisa Tomei did well acting but Hollywood has a pact that if the actress is nude most of the movie, she would get nominated. (I.e. Halle Berry and Diane Lane) Evan Rachel Wood played a convincing tormented daughter, and her acting definitely deserved some Oscar buzz. The ending was necessary and subsequently enough, it made the movie. Hardcore Aronofsky fans won't see his artsy style forte in this movie; but they will see the truth and emotion-driven honesty that makes his movies great. As for everyday moviegoers, its an important movie in modern cinema and shouldn't be missed."
"da_lowdown","9","1","1","27 January 2009"," The perils of living in the past
","Randy ""the Ram"" Robinson is stuck in the past. He was a wrestling idol in the 80s, but now spends his weekends in the small 'indie' wrestling circuits trying to relive his glory days, and scraping by on weekdays as a strong back at the local Acme grocery store loading dock where he is brow beaten and humiliated by a hateful mouse of a boss. Although he seems to still have adulation in the tight circles of wrestling, and some of the neighborhood kids, there aren't any real relationships in his life. His better days are way behind him, but he doesn't care, he just want to keep wrestling. After one particularly brutal match, he has near fatal heart attack.<br/><br/>After his heart attack, he attempts to establish a 'real' relationship with a stripper named Cassidy (actually Pam in her ""real life"") played by Marissa Tomie. Cassidy, like Randy, also operates in the margins of society and has seen better days. As an aging stripper, she struggles to sell table dances, and is often mistreated by the clientele. Unlike Randy, however, she makes a separation between her stage persona, and her real life as a mother. She even seems to have plans to leave stripping behind. His awkward charm almost wins her over. But we can tell she's smarter than that. This is a woman that's been hurt too many times in life, and her defense mechanisms need to work right if she wants to protect her son and get them to a better life. Some may view her as a cold and calculating bitch, but as we sit back and observe her, we see the human being beating inside the tough exterior. The ending scene shows just how human she is. And how sometimes, despite your best efforts and intentions, you're just a little too late to save some people.<br/><br/>After his heart attack, Randy also tries to re-establish his relationship with his estranged daughter. Their meetings provide some of the movies most poignant scenes. Their initial meeting doesn't go well. We can't blame her for her bitterness and anger. He was, after all a lousy parent. But Randy persists, and in a powerful scene by the beach, they seem to start on their road to reconciliation. There is a brief scene where she takes his arm as they walk, indicating her forgiveness. It almost brought me to tears. Beauty can sometimes be found in subtlety. His final meeting with his daughter is especially heart wrenching. It seems like he's finally turning a corner. He's earned our affection, and we want his redemption. But his old flaws resurface, and redemption slips away. <br/><br/>Initially, it seems that Randy continues to wrestle because he loves it so much. But as we watch the character flesh out, we recognized him in some of the people we've probably known in our lives. The old star athletes, or performers (actors and such) who can't get past their glory days. They can't move on with their lives and can't accomplish much else, because they are stuck in the past. Most would come to classify their kind as 'losers'. Randy seems to fit the bill. Unfortunate because despite his flaws, he has a big generous heart. He may be a 'loser', but he's still a 'good guy'. That's why Randy, and others like him are walking tragedies. This is not to say that nostalgia is a bad thing, but there is a difference between missing the past, and an insistence on re-living it. Poor Randy never moved on. I don't think it was his love of the ring as much as his love of the adulation and acceptance he felt in his past. His final heartbreaking words to Cassidy near the end of the movie verify this. This seems to be the heart of the movie. <br/><br/>The 'Wrestler' is a work of art. We need more movies like this to prove that great films can be made on a budget. The editing is lean enough so that it keeps the story-telling moving at a brisk pace. The Cinematography is appropriately grainy and downbeat with muted colors. The script is full of character details so that even brief supporting roles feel like flesh and blood. Mickey Rourke's performance was so good, I completely forgot that I was observing an actor. Marissa Tomei also holds her own with an excellent performance.<br/><br/>******Spoiler Alert******<br/><br/>Regarding some of the complaints about the 'open ending': Personally, I thought the ending was poetic. The tight shot of him taking that final leap from the ropes, as it leaving this world into another, and then a slow fade to black, was breathtaking. No, it didn't spell out his fate, but you can pretty much guess the outcome based on the story's and character's arc. Besides, focusing on the ending, is missing the point of the movie.<br/><br/>The past may have been great, but it's gone, so move on and evolve. Take care of your loved ones while you have a chance now. And there is always tomorrow."

","Darren Afronosky's film on drug addiction - Requiem for A Dream happens to be one of my favorite films and after hearing so much of appreciation for his new film ¬ñ The Wrestler, I took the plunge and saw it. After having watched it, I can easily say that 'The Wrestler' is one of the finest films I have ever seen! It gave me an inside perspective on the wrestling world, one that made me realize that what we call fake could be the only real thing in these wrestler's lives. The beauty of 'The Wrestler' is that it'll appeal to not only the niche audience of wrestling fans but also the general cine goers with no interest in wrestling.<br/><br/>The Wrestler makes for a fantastic and fascinating character study. The fictional character of Randy 'The Ram' has achieved the pinnacle of fame and success as a wrestler in the 1980s but loses it all and fades into the oblivion. Now, he lives all alone in a trailer park, is poor both materialistically and in terms of relationships. Then Randy despite his fading health, decides to make a big comeback after 20 long years and resurrect his career. The conundrum this character faces of deciding which place he truly belongs ¬ñ the wrestling world where the fans cheer and shout when he jumps from the top of the ring or the actual world where he lives in the wilderness and is just a middle aged man going through financial and emotional crisis, makes for the rest of the plot.<br/><br/>The Wrestler shows you the de-glamorized and behind the rings footage of what actually happens in the wrestling world - of how fights are choreographed and the hazards these athletes take. Essentially, the plot can be divided into three parts ¬ñ Randy's comeback, the stripper played by Marisa Tomei whom Randy visits as a customer but develops feelings for, and his daughter with whom he tries to mend his broken relationship. The turmoil that the protagonist goes through in these three areas of his life truly shakes you. All along you feel and are moved by the entire range of emotions of this character, be it his frustrations, regret, anger, anguish or cynicism. The screenplay is filled with so many deeply moving moments that bring out the tears in your eyes.<br/><br/>Mickey Rourke, the boxer turned actor who plays Andy is pretty much at home playing the tough wrestler and does a great job at that. But what surprises is you is his perfection and brilliance in the scenes where he shows or expresses his emotions. The scene where he confesses his regret to his daughter makes you dig inside your pocket for that handkerchief! It is a phenomenal performance by Mickey Rourke and it would be criminal on the part of the Academy to deny him an Oscar for the 'Best Performance in a leading role.' Other highly noteworthy performances are of Marisa Tomei who plays the stripper and Randy's daughter played by Rachel Wood, who is with her raw emotions in the scene where her father fails to turn up for the dinner he promised they'd take together, deeply impacts you.<br/><br/>Darren Afronosky has got it all right 'The Wrestler'. It is grounded, true to life tale and one of the best, if not the best movies of 2008. And yes I reiterate that there's no one more deserving than Mickey Rourke for the best actor Oscar this year. Its a knock out performance!"
"aronf13","10","1","1","25 January 2009"," The Raging Bull of the decade
","The Raging Bull of the decade? Absolutely. Darron Aronofsky successfully channels Scorsese by treating this tale with a visceral edge and a tragic sadness about it, and Mickey Rourke's firecracker performance may very well be every bit as classic as Robert DeNiro's (appropriate since his real life personality and past is eerily similar to his character here). Many might feel strange about the creator of the Requiem For A Dream and the equally ambitious Fountain handling material that appears this pedestrian on the surface. But despite the fact that his signature melodrama and high production is toned down for a raw documentary-style of film making, the intentions and themes are every bit as transcendent as his old works. The tale of Randy ""The Ram"" is not a run-of-the-mill story of a wrestler, but of a man who does what he does in order to feel love. He pursues his painful career not because he enjoys the action of it, but because he wants the love that his audience gives him. He becomes a slave to that desire for human contact, putting his body through hell because of his clear lack of appreciation in his every day life. Paralleled with the tale of a stripper whose affections he pines for and whose own life contains an emptiness equal to his, this becomes much more than the story of a wrestler. It becomes an allegory for the things that drive us into destruction. Aronofsky has always been brilliant at creating this near perfect thematic structures, but it's always been undermined by ridiculously overdone productions. With The Wrestler's more understated style, he finally fulfills his potential."

","Who would have thought that washed up and notorious Mickey Rourke would be the front-runner for an Academy Award for playing Randy Ram Robinson, a veteran professional wrestler and celebrity in the wrestling entertainment world. First, I am not a wrestling fan in the least and this film shows the bruises, damage, and the non glorious side of the sport. Rourke is beautiful as the bruised, damaged self-proclaimed ""piece of meat."" The beginning of the film shows him as the washed up Ram after an appearance and his life where he lives alone in a trailer park where he hasn't paid his rent. He works days at the Acme supermarket and nights where he goes to a strip club and befriends Cassidy played by Marisa Tomei. If people thought her first Oscar win was a shock, she should get her second Academy Award for this performance as the stripper and single mom who wins Ram's heart. Ram has a daughter, Stephanie, played well by Evan Rachel Wood but her character never is fleshed out as more than just his lesbian daughter living with her girlfriend but it's never said. He just suspects and we don't know much about Stephanie's history in the first place. We don't have that connection between them which would help explain their wounded relationship. Maybe Stephanie is more her father's daughter than she pretends not to be. I didn't like the ending but I won't spoil it for anybody else except that it's not clear. Regardless, the film was shot on a very low budget but it's still inspiring and Mickey Rourke's performance is well alone worth the effort in watching him despite the pain and blood that comes with wrestling. If you didn't have any respect for wrestlers or strippers before the film, the film will make you look at wrestlers and strippers a little differently. Tomei's character, Cassidy, shows a different side of a stripper about aging in a profession where they don't want you too and where you're nothing but a piece of meat. In reality, Cassidy and Ram can both share in professions where they use their bodies. For both, it is not only a way of life but a living. For Cassidy and others in the profession, they make more money than working as secretaries in reality. Ram's whole life is wrestling. If you take that away from him, you take away his life's meaning."

","Just for a change, let's talk about Evan Rachel Wood. As the daughter of this movie's absolute focal point, the anabolic phoenix you-know-who, she gives a hyperventilating, overwrought, method-ish performance, especially in the last of her three scenes, when she slams the door on the long-lost stumblebum's last chance at redemption. The effect is jarring, wrong: she seems to be coming in from another world, or at least another movie. And then, days later, you realize that you have been caught, sucked into seeing Wood from the wrestler's point of view: he can't possibly understand her either. The years apart have rendered the divide unbridgeable, little miss Emo versus a guy who has learned to accept every sort of punishment as a way of life. She is truly gone, and this is why he rejects Marisa Tomei's attempt at a happy ending: refusing to chase the shadows of domestic bliss is his own brand of wisdom. This kind of working-class fatalism is a sentimental fallacy, running through ring movies from the dawn of time; but it is so perfectly played and so dramatically inevitable that you understand its truth even as you struggle against it. None of which would mean much without the anabolic phoenix, whom I've never seen in a lead role before and whose shattered stoicism would have been just as devastating if this were his first film."

","I had heard a lot of hype surrounding this movie, and as a lifelong wrestling fan I was hoping this would portray professional wrestling in a positive light. While it did showcase the best about professional wrestling, it also helped expose the seedy underworld of the sport as well: Sex, drugs and steroids. While the tone of the film itself is dark and moody (what did you expect from the director of Requiem For a Dream), one cannot help but root for Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson to clean himself up and do the right thing. The Ram is played brilliantly by Mickey Roarke and he certainly deserves every single accolade that is tossed his way. As with any great actor, you forget that it is an actor and you truly believe that Rourke IS The Ram! With strong supporting jobs by fellow Oscar nominee Marisa Tomei and Evan Rachael Wood, The Wrestler in my opinion was the best film of 2008. Even if you are not a professional wrestling fan, this film draws you in from the very beginning as it is more a melancholy portrait of the life of a broken down man who searches for redemption, only to find that sometimes redemption is not something that can be found in the form of family or friends, but more so in the ability to bring happiness to the lives of total strangers. A very strong 9/10. Worth watching in the theater and owning on DVD or Blu-ray."
"lpt1021","9","1","1","25 January 2009"," Wonderful film with a sad story
","I never expected this film to be what it is. It exceeded my expectations. Mickey Rourke gives a powerful and admirable performance as this man who, after being a big star, is now defeated and is trying to survive. I felt sorry for this character. Sorry for a man who doesn't know his way in life, who doesn't know what he wants but who seems to be a man with a soul and a desire to share his feelings with someone who really cares about him. The supporting cast was brilliant. Marisa Tomei's performance is subtle but strong, whose character is in pretty much the same conditions as the lead's. Evan Rachel Wood is excellent as the estranged daughter, who, to my opinion, was very hard on her father and didn't quite understand him. She just gave up on him. The last scene with Marisa Tomei is wonderful. Those words were very true. Another thing that I liked, was the nice touch of Rourke's character walking through the hallways and downstairs with the cheer of an audience in the background."
"paudie","8","1","1","23 January 2009"," Old Fashioned Theme but Very Good
","This film is old fashioned in many ways but nonetheless very enjoyable. <br/><br/>How many films have we seen where a down on his luck character does his best to get his live back together by reconciling with family and having a last try for true love? This is the story of ""The Wrestler"" in a nutshell but what makes it stand out are the performances of Rourke and Tomei in particular and the uncompromising detail of the wrestling sequences. <br/><br/>There is no doubt that Mickey Rourke's real life fall from grace was in my mind as I watched him play Randy The Ram Robinson. You can't help but wonder how much of his own life he sees in the character. Randy realises in the film that the only part of his life that he can be successful in is wrestling. We see how his attempts at family relationships and holding down a job are doomed to failure. He hates being called by his real name, even while working in a deli. In the end he admits that in front of his adoring fans is the only place that he can feel comfortable and happy. He thinks he sees a kindred spirit in exotic dancer Cassidy. She, however, is very careful to separate her ""real life"", raising a son, saving to buy a condo, from her life as a performer. She has a rule of no contact with customers outside the bar. She is tempted to break it with Randy but in the end they both realise (at different times) that it won't work. <br/><br/>Even an ending that can be seen coming from a long way out doesn't take away from this excellent movie. The wrestling scenes are excellent, getting across the performance aspect of the ""show"" as well as the down at heel air of wrestling at a lower level. Recommended viewing."
"Cinema_Fan","8","1","1","22 January 2009"," Breaking bones with sticks-and-stones, and hearts
","Filmed in glorious 16mm, the wonderful format of the ""amateur"", the maverick, the Independent moviemaker, and casting a symbolic texture of street-level realism. Here, we see Darren Aronofsky, along with the likes of Tobe Hooper's The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974) and the work by Shane Meadows, such as Dead Man's Shoes (2004) and This Is England (2006) for example, bringing the Independent feel to the Big Screen once more with The Wrestler. While in good company, The Wrestler alongside Herz's and Kaufman's The Toxic Avenger (1984), Hallstr√∂m's and Hedges's What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993), Andrea Arnold's beautiful and touching Red Road (2006) and Noel Clarkes' work, for example, all have that Independent vibe about them. This is what separates them from the norm, the need to express their thoughts onto film without the constraints of mediocrity. All highly imaginative, unique, fresh and individual pieces of work that are testament to the skill of all those involved by venturing further a field with daring and courage. The Wrestler is certainly no exception.<br/><br/>While a title in the sense of a singular, perspective we can very quickly gather that there is a much wider and broader feel to the content. This, The Wrestler, is not so much about a single entity but a whole way of life, a sub-culture, who through immense pride and camaraderie, find that life on the right side of the ropes can become exciting and justly rewarding. Darren Aronofsky and writer Robert D. Siegel, on the other hand, have produced a film of immense sorrow and suffering seen via a victim of the times and literally time itself. Mickey Rourke's Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson could very well have been anyone, in fact, he is ""everyone"", he has become symbolic of these past, present and future aging, bruised and battered men, crippled and broken spiritually, physically and emotionally by constant years of hard, torturous abuse for the sport they love and that has loved them in return and which now rejects them. One has only to see the scene of realisation and hard reality check while The Ram has set his table of old videos and posters ready for autographing, sits along fellow comrades too far gone and broken, it finally sinks in that he too has now joined the destitute and lost. Beautiful.<br/><br/>Seen here is the life of the hardships of those who were born just too late. Too late for everlasting fame. Too late for that all-important Cable T.V. deal. Too late for the Video-game merchandise rights and too late for lady-luck to grace her way to better times ahead before the fading light of fame has flickered and died and past the point of no return. This is a very simple tale with honest hard-working characters who are striving to earn a buck to pay the rent, to feed their kids, making ends meet to justify the end. The mighty may have fallen but they have not given up, maybe through a need of necessity rather than love of their profession, they carry on. These are not stupid people, criminals they are not and living in poverty, bedding down in trailers or if that also includes working nights pole-dancing, such as Marisa Tomei's ""Cassidy"", makes them just as worthy of praise if they are willing to simply try.<br/><br/>It is in this life that both writer and director have projected a loving narrative of loneliness. With The Rams back-room bonding and mutual respect of his co-wrestlers' that is very much replicated, it is here that the life of this tired old man finds the necessary tools to fill the void. Often touching and more than often painful to bear witness that his life is completely empty albeit the roar of the crowed, their adulation and what little pennies it earns. It is with great praise, also, that Mickey Rourke has held the spirit of this sub-culture high with grace and virtue, a stupendous performance that shines throughout to transcend the pathos of his lonely existence, on the wrong side of the ropes. An exceedingly moving film, beautifully exposing the harsh realities of a life, a way-of-life, of a broken man and his courage to see his faults and his determination to pull himself up and away from the slings-and-arrows that are thrown toward him. The Wrestler wins this bout."
"fablesofthereconstru-1","9","1","1","20 January 2009"," Beautiful loser
","The late Kevin DuBrow was right: metal health will drive you mad. To the pile-driving strains of Quiet Riot, the filmmaker aptly demonstrates how fame is often a fleeting thing, ephemeral like a promotional flyer; fame left Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson(Mickey O'Rourke) years ago, seemingly, in a heartbeat, or the time it takes for a hit record to run its course. After the needles takes leave of the groove, there is silence, there is the memory of the song. Alone backstage, on a metal folding chair, we meet Randy, a middle-aged man whose muscle-bound body is clearly entering its winter season. Preparing himself for his latest match, the viewer is made to feel like an intruder, as the wrestler keeps his back to us. Unlike most current films, the camera is used to convey information about the subject; in ""The Wrestler"", in the next scene, Randy's back continues to keep us at bay, while the camera follows him into the gym, where his adoring public, mostly middle-aged men, await the wrestler for a quick picture and autograph as reminders of their vanishing youth. These people, his fan-base, don't judge the aging wrestler like we do. To them, in their eyes, this ramshackle man is still ""The Ram"", and not the carnie sideshow attraction who knows his best days are behind him. That is the significance of the relationship between the camera and its subject; to show how Randy's best days are behind him. While professional wrestling may not be riding the surf of popularity as it did back in the eighties, it persists as a subculture in which Randy can relive his glory days, and surround himself with the flotsam and jetsam of eighties excess.<br/><br/>Professional wrestling as we all know is largely choreographed; its matches are predetermined, but to call the sport fake is hardly apt; it's entertainment, like a dance routine, but with bleeding and the perchance for paralysis. Wrestling's duality, as both exhibition and athletic corporeality, finds perfect expression in Randy's self-inflicted cutting of his forehead, during a rigorous bout where both wrestlers convince us that something real is going on. This willingness to hurt himself, on purpose, mirrors the scene, later in the film, when Randy misses his dinner date with Stephanie(Evan Rachel Woods). He hurts the Mohawked wrestler; he hurts his estranged daughter; he hurts himself, as he will always be doomed to do. Randy not only wrestles professionally, he wrestles personally too, which makes ""The Wrestler"" sound like an update of the screenplay that Barton Fink(John Turturro) tries to sneak past the studio head(Michael Lerner) in the Joel and Ethan Coen film that took Cannes by storm in 1991. It's not the genre film that Jack Lipnick commissioned the novice scribe to write, as the screenplay becomes Fink-like by using wrestling as a metaphor for the way Randy conducts his life.<br/><br/>In the film's best scene, Randy takes Stephanie to the beach; he points to the ghosts of Coney Island, which leads them to an abandoned, derelict ballroom, where father and daughter dance with only the seaboard air to accompany their first shy steps as a reconciled family. Unfortunately, the music suggested by the setting, given the context of Randy's bacchanal past, is AC/DC's ""Big Balls""(everybody now, for Bon: ""And we've got the biggest/balls of them all!""), so we know, something will go awry. And it does, because in Stephanie's words, dad is a ""f***-up"". Although he purposely cuts his thumb on a slicer, the more obvious echo to his first self-inflicted cutting, standing up Stephanie causes more bleeding than his mishap in the supermarket ever could. Like a confab with his wrestling opponent, after their brief encounter at the seashore, ""The Ram"" tells ""The Goth"" what he's going to do beforehand. But in the biggest irony of them all, Randy pulls off a move that his beleaguered daughter wasn't expecting.<br/><br/>Randy f****-up again, late in the film, when he returns to the ring, against doctor's orders, against stripper's orders, too. In John Avildsen's ""Rocky"", Adrian(Talia Shire) can't watch the pugilist fight because she loves him too much. Cassidy(Marisa Tomei), on the other hand, leaves the gymnasium, because she doesn't love him enough. He's like a narcissistic Jesus Christ; he's dying for his own sins. In a career-topping performance, Mickey O'Rourke plays a man who is wrestling himself. And loses. For real."

"mjscarface","9","1","1","20 January 2009"," Beautiful but heartbreaking.
","On paper, 'The Wrestler' just seems like another 'Rocky'-type sports movie - but within minutes, that preconception flies out the window and you realise that, despite the well-worn premise, this moving drama is something else entirely.<br/><br/>I haven't seen a film in ages that manages to be both uplifting and truly downbeat at the SAME time. There's no clear separation between the two; in 'The Wrestler', those two things stem from one another. This might not make sense until you see the film, but it all comes down to one man, his flaws and his passion. That man is Randy 'The Ram' Robinson.<br/><br/>A huge wrestling star in the 80's, Randy has seen his best years pass him by - at the expense of his family. Now, 20 years on, Randy reluctantly works in a supermarket, spends his weekends wrestling at school gyms and community centres for small crowds and otherwise blows his money on steroids and a stripper named Cassidy.<br/><br/>Inside the ring, Randy feels alive and most importantly, feels loved. Outside in the real world, his life is an empty mess. What makes 'The Wrestler' so different to standard sports dramas, is not in the fight for victory (after all, the sport itself is inherently a performance), but rather in one man's desperate efforts to maintain the bubble in which he's lived for 20 years. One the one hand, it's thrilling to see him in action but on the other, it's depressing to think that he has nothing else in his life.<br/><br/>Randy is a good guy at heart, but generally messes up and doesn't know how to fix his mistakes. After suffering a heart attack, he decides to retire and tries and reconnect with his estranged daughter and build a romance with Cassidy. However, the outcome one might expect is not the one that we get and the effect is heartbreaking.<br/><br/>Mickey Rourke absolutely nails the role and truly deserves an Oscar for his honest and emotional performance - he also looks fantastic in the ring. 'Sin City' brought him back to the big time, but this his his show and if he doesn't win that Oscar I'll eat my lycra shorts. Marisa Tomei is pretty good as Cassidy, whose own career parallels with Randy's. Her character, however, knows how to separate her life from her job (also a performance for the cheering crowd) and serves more to demonstrate how Randy is incapable of doing that.<br/><br/>The script and direction are both very well done - Darren Aronofsky reins in his own style to suit the story which is admirable. There are still some little touches and subtle tricks, however, which have a tremendous impact. For one example, Randy makes his way to the deli counter for his first shift - the camera follows him as though he's making his way to a big match, with the sounds of cheering crowds in the background. Randy pauses, takes a deep breath and goes through the plastic flaps - and the sound vanishes. It's a perfect insight into Randy's borderline-delusional mind.<br/><br/>But Randy isn't crazy, by no means, he's just passionate for one thing in life. Unfortunately, that one thing is just an act, a show - which makes the whole thing so tragic. I recommend 'The Wrestler' and only knocked 1 star off for a couple of times where the film seemed stuck in a routine, whether that was intentional or not, but it wasn't a major problem. Go see it!"
"treadwaywrites","Null","1","1","16 January 2009"," Rourke Makes A Comeback
","It was really so nice to see Mickey Rourke doing some quality acting again. He plays Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson, an 80s superstar wrestler who has seen better days. The movie finds Randy barely able to pay his rent. His life is a series of odd jobs and small wrestling gigs. His highlight activity is going to the local strip club where he get lap dances from Cassidy, a struggling mom played by the invenerable Marisa Tomei. Tomei attacks her role with the same hang-it-out-there bravado that Rourke does and the two of them are explosive. An upcoming 20th anniversary of one of Randy's biggest matches gives him new hope to get his life back on track and he decides to reach out to the daughter (Evan Rachel Wood) he abandoned years earlier.<br/><br/>The indie buzz has been building about this movie since Rourke signed on. When the film made it to the Venice Film Festival in September it was quickly purchased and then the buzz turned to awards talk. So far Rourke has taken home the Golden Globe and has his weary eyes on Oscar.<br/><br/>The movie is just fantastic due to the fine performances. Randy the Ram seems like the role that Rourke was destined to play and character and actor seem to fuse and for a time the audience doesn't know where one begins and the other ends. Tomei is equally impressive and reminds us why she is already an Oscar winner. The movie has some brutal moments and some shadowing humor and is overall a really great work for director Darren Aronofsky.<br/><br/>Finally, the posters for the movie are all Rourke. If you're a Mickey Rourke fan like me then you will be running to get one of these heartfelt images."
"ametaphysicalshark","Null","1","1","4 January 2009"," Worth seeing for the performances
","Darren Aronofsky's ""The Wrestler"" employs a pleasingly stripped-down visual look and uses plenty of hand-held camera (not the shaky variety), but this also comes off as forced and predictable, a calculated measure more than a natural stylistic choice. It's suitable for the small-scale drama which ""The Wrestler"" is, but nothing remarkable, although it doesn't really need to be. Similarly, the script offers an interesting lead character and takes us through a short period in his life, and briefly examines his relationship with his daughter and with a stripper and single mother he is romantically interested in. By the end of the film, you really feel like you have seen a fairly interesting and important part of this man's life, but it didn't feel to me like a complete emotional journey. It barely felt deserving of a film. This is basically a film which shows us a man going through, for most of its running time, what millions and millions of men in the United States must experience on a daily basis. Furthermore, there is nothing especially entertaining, especially remarkable, especially notable about this man except for him having been famous at one point. I read through reviews of ""The Wrestler"" and I wonder if the people writing about the film saw something entirely different to what I saw, a nice little low-key drama, but that's all, a competently-written low-key drama with no tidy resolutions and a sense of emotional ambiguity. The final shot and the speech preceding it are supposed to inspire emotion, but I was more emotionally invested in what played right after: Bruce Springsteen's excellent new song ""The Wrestler"". This is not a bad film by any means, nor a particularly notable or interesting one, and I'm a little baffled by the praise for the film itself. With a lesser cast this would have been a middling, pointless affair, but it's made worthwhile by Mickey Rourke's wonderfully understated and believable performance (which, I do have to say, is a little over-hyped as well, and nothing compared to my favorite couple of performances of the year, including a similar portrayal of a somewhat similar character- Jean Claude Van-Damme as himself in ""JCVD""). Marisa Tomei is superb as well, every scene she's in is packed with genuine emotion, and Evan Rachel Wood is wasted, although she's fine in her few scenes. ""The Wrestler"" is a film driven by its performances, and ultimately worth seeing for them alone, but nothing else about it achieves excellence."
"frogsupmyarse","7","1","1","30 December 2008"," Gritty Effort From The Square Ring
","I went into the this film not sure if i had to be a fan of wrestling or follower of Rourke to enjoy this one, but having now watched it i think maybe you'l enjoy this more if your neither, and approach this movie with an open mind.The story revolves the decaying life of professional wrestler Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson played by Rourke who personifies everything you imagine a former wrestler to resemble from the steroid fueled muscles, the battered face weathered from years of abuse from both inside and outside the ring accompanied by long bleached hair and most importantly the personality.<br/><br/>We find ""The Ram"" still chasing a return to the big time that he seems to believe can be his salvation from the mediocrity that he inhabits on a daily basis but despite his enduring self believe that a return to greatness is just around the corner, his body cannot take the physical strain he places upon it and he suffers a heart attack following the conclusion of a bout. This is the real start of the real core of he movie as Rourke excels portraying a man who is drowning in sea of his own loneliness, desperate to keep his head above water grabbing on to whatever he can to selfishly preserve himself, in this case his daughter Stephanie played by Evan Rachael Wood and a lap dancer played by Marisa Tomei, both of whom add real acting dept to this movie.<br/><br/>Tomei's strong performance here reminds you of what a watchable actress she is playing Cassidy a lap dancer favored by Robinson in a local strip club. Looking great, Tomei still manages to portray a character strong in spirits, who still has ambitions to better herself despite working in what feels like arena of broken dreams and gin soaked heart ache.When on screen with Robinson you get the feeling that she could be the one person with the ability to save him and give him some sort of spiritual fulfillment outside the ring he increasingly longs for.<br/><br/>The scenes between Robinson and his daughter highlight just how selfish his pursuit of glory has been to the people nearest to him as he attempts to mend their fractured relationship and construct what you believe is his interpretation of a normal life, working in a deli counter where you see flash's of showmanship as Robinson tries to woo his customers with his charm in a bid to find his own acceptance with his new found station in life.<br/><br/>The story line of a washed up sports star is not a new concept but what sets this movie apart from others in the genre is that Rouke's character is very much a true representation of a real person with very real flaws.This is not the story of a fallen hero returning but of a man desperately seeking validation of his existence and the establishment of some sort of legacy before he dies. So engrossed in his belief that the life of a wrestling star is his sole chance for redemption he knowingly allows himself to sabotage the chance to reconcile with his daughter in exchange for physical gratification deriving from a chance encounter in a bar and follows it up destroying his improving relationship with Cassidy as his ego consumes him. Robinson comes to the conclusion that he doesn't belong in a normal life, and maybe he doesn't belong in life at all if he cant wrestle so he walks away from his attempts at normality and straight towards the wrestling ring and potentially his death.<br/><br/>The film poignantly concludes in the ring as it began where ""The Ram"" at peace in the adoration of strangers decides to perform, a decision you feel will be fatal, and as he climbs the ropes you cant help but muse if he is sentencing himself to death for the guilt he feels about short comings in his own life and the hurt he causes those around him or because he is human, scared, lonely and see's no way out but to fight no matter what the cost."

","TW is not an awful film, but it's certainly not in the same league as Aronofsky's ""Pi"", ""Requiem for A Dream"", and ""The Fountain"". These films exhibited some style and originality, but TW just retreads ""Rocky"" and half-a-dozen other films about washed-up athletes. All the mandatory clich√©s are there...estranged daughter, stripper with a heart of gold who has a rule about dating customers, unsuccessful attempts to hold a regular (non-wrestling) job, and so forth. It might as well have been titled ""Wrestler: The Rehash"".<br/><br/>Again, unlike his previous films, Aronofsky does not demonstrate any real style in filming the story. It's workmanlike, and the editing is pretty good, but there's absolutely no pizazz to it.<br/><br/>Some people will go to see this film thinking that it will give you insight into the world of professional wrestling. While it's true that you get to see a bit of what it's like backstage, you never get the feeling that you understand it that well. It's similar to walking through an auto factory and expecting to understand the auto business.<br/><br/>Finally, we come to Rourke's performance. Now, I like Rourke as an actor as much as any guy. This is one reason that I squirm when I see what he has done to himself over the past 20 years. Fortunately (or unfortunately), the combination of substance abuse, face lifts, and botox does a pretty good job of preparing him to look like a washed-up wrestler who has abused his body beyond the point of endurance. As far as the actual acting, not so good. And Tomei is never convincing as the dancer who is his romantic interest, either.<br/><br/>In conclusion, not an awful film, but not up to Aronofsky's other work."

"attack_of_the_jack","6","4","9","21 January 2009"," A bit disappointed.
","I was a little disappointed with this movie to say the very least. Based on Golden Globe Nominations & wins, also exacerbated by general hype, this movie didn't really meet my expectations. Saying that, I do feel that director Darren Aronofsky and the cast, especially Mickey Rourke, created a very raw and real drama, following aging and tired wrestler, 'Randy the Ram' through struggles, financial, personal and health wise. The film is very 'rough around the edges' and far from a fairytale, and unfortunately walked out feeling unfulfilled and uninspired, despite the film's attempts at implanting a message into viewers. I knew what I was going to get, seeing as this movie is about a wrestler, but I felt much of the blood and gore in the film was quite unnecessary, delving into details that the audience just doesn't need to see. I personally would have liked more of a focus on the relationship behind Randy and his daughter, played by Rachel Evan Wood, who for such a believable performance was very underused. I felt it very hard to feel for Randy's character after such a brief depiction of their connection. Overall, this movie was too detailed in parts I didn't want it to be in and not detailed enough in parts I really wanted to care about. However, I am sure that many people would enjoy this film and Rourke was very deserving of his Golden Globe Award."
"Hitchcoc","10","3","6","18 December 2009"," Rourke's Masterpiece
","When I saw this title, I thought, ""Good Lord. It's a rasslin movie. I assumed it would be some juvenile portrayal of the Smackdown people and their ilk. I was wrong. What we have is an insider's view of the incredible world of these people. Rourke is an aging hero called the Ram. He is past his prime and when he does wrestle he ends up loaded with more bumps and bruises than he can count--if not real, it is a tremendously athletic sport. There are subplots with an off and on relationship with Marissa Tomei, an exotic dancer, and his estranged daughter. He is unpredictable, messed up on pain killers and life. He also finds out he is living with a time bomb--a heart that could give out at any time. The strength of this is the subtle, beautiful performance of Mickey Rourke. His acting is superb. We can see the pathos in his eyes. A man who was great but has nothing left to show for it. It's about a man just trying to get by, who wants to make one more score. This is superb film about something we know little of."

This was to be an exception.<br/><br/>I guess I am a romantic and had hoped to see a turn-around in the protagonist. There was little. If anything, he was an anti-hero. Not even would this movie qualify as a Victorian tragedy for there were no two ships passing in the night. Just one that sunk into the muck.<br/><br/>The story is not one that had to be told. At the end of the movie, I did not feel I was enlightened in any way and that is the mechanism I use to evaluate a film/story. The main character is a looser.

","Some people are very easily pleased! I cannot believe the hype this film has had or the score it has been given here. Basically a old wrestler has a hart attack, and is told he will never wrestle again. Guess what he does! That is the end off film. No twist, no shock; just boring and predictable. Just because a film is well acted does not make it interesting. Within 30mins of the film you know exactly where its going, and it just was not interesting. I am sure wrestlers lives are far more interesting than the way this one was portrayed. There are documentaries about real wrestlers that are far more interesting. The film did not show you how or why he lost his money, or if he did ever have money. It just wasted time showing him chasing after a stripper, and letting down his daughter again."

"MartinHafer","8","3","7","14 August 2010"," Painful to watch...
","This film is, at times, very painful to watch. The wrestling scenes are brutally violent and bloody--with some of the action real and hard to see. Reportedly, the staples and several other body-scarring scenes were real! You can't say that Mickey Rourke wasn't willing to suffer for his art! Plus, when you see the post-match Rourke barely able to move or function, it's hard to watch--and you want to avert your eyes. It's definitely a no holds barred sort of movie.<br/><br/>Rourke plays an aging wrestler who has gained some fame but also is working in the second-tier of the profession. In other words, the job is violent but doesn't even pay well--and plays in lesser venues. You get the impression that he was a big-name star at one point, but by now time has taken its toll and he's seen better days. His body is covered in scars, he's reduced to needing a hearing aid and he has just suffered a heart attack. Now that his career is about over, he is looking to make a few changes--to get a real job and try to reacquaint himself with his estranged daughter. It's interesting because although the violence is very hard to watch, seeing him try to make a new life is often more painful and the film pulls no punches in this warts and all treatment. As his character says ""I'm just an old broken down piece of meat...all alone...and I deserve to be alone..."". This sort of tough dialog, very good acting and an unrelenting script make this one a memorable film....but such a painful one that many might want to think twice about watching.<br/><br/>By the way, in addition to being a very bloody and violent film, there is quite a bit of nudity. I was surprised to see Marisa Tomei doing all the nude scenes--usually with an Oscar-winning actress they do not do such work. For a woman in her mid-40s, she sure had nothing to be ashamed of when it came to her figure--but just be forewarned that you'll see a lot of her."

The side characters did not impress me much as well. Marisa Tormei was fine , as she always is . Her acting talents were wasted. I did like the 80s soundtrack and I feel that Bruce Springsteen was robbed by the Academy by not being nominated for his song The Wrestler. Other than the music and some shock scenes that were more inline with a B Horror flick , the movie did not have much. Whoever marketed this movie did a great job, because it seems to be getting tons of kudos. I am still waiting for Mr. Rourkes comeback , because I did not see it in this."

","With all the hype surrounding the film and Mickey Rourke's performance I was really looking forward to seeing 'The Wrestler'. But, it happened again. An much-hyped film failed to deliver and left me feeling disappointed.<br/><br/>The strengths of the film all lie in the performances. Rourke deserved his Golden Globe win and deserves an Academy Award nomination. Marisa Tomei is fantastic, as ever. She really has to be one of the bravest mainstream actresses around. Evan Rachel Wood is also good, as are all the minor characters.<br/><br/>So no complaints at all with the acting. It's with the script and direction that the film disappoints.<br/><br/>While the script has the narrative arc of a classic tragedy and is fairly easy to predict it just doesn't have enough pathos to allow us to be moved and surprised by what unfolds. Basically I just didn't like the characters enough to really care about their fate.<br/><br/>The film has the feel of movie-making by numbers.<br/><br/>The ""fallen hero"" has a life changing experience that brings him near to some sort of redemption but is then finally brought down by the personal failings that have determined the pattern of his life.<br/><br/>It was all handled just a bit too crudely for my taste. Randy 'The Ram' Robinson was just a little too self-pitying. Cassidy/Pam was just a little too much the working girl with a heart of gold. <br/><br/>Just a little more finesse would have made this a truly great film. As it is, however, The Wrestler' is fatally flawed, just like Randy 'The Ram' Robinson."
"mark-whait","10","2","4","19 December 2010"," Rourke triumphs over adversity in astonishing movie
","The Wrestler is one of the most poignant and powerful movies to come out of Hollywood in the past decade. Micky Rourke gives a quite astonishing performance as the ageing, broken hearted (and boned) fighter living on past glories desperately patching up his abandoned body to keep eking out a living doing the only thing he knows how to. His life is turned on its head when he suffers a heart attack in the aftermath of a brutal fight, yet wonderfully the picture fails to fall into the clich√©s of fight movies and avoids all the pitfalls that are invariably attached to a vehicle of this kind. Never before have we see seen so graphically and movingly just what the fighters have to go through in the name of entertainment and to give their fans what they want. We see the wrestlers discussing their moves before each fight, but this doesn't detract from the bone crunching punishment they take even if their bouts are elaborately stage managed. There is no better fight scene in the movie than when Rourke secretly cuts his own forehead with a concealed razor blade to get the crowd believing his injury has been caused in the ring. Rourke then has to try and achieve a reconciliation with his distant daughter, and also tries to build a relationship with lap dancing Marisa Tomei. The parallels between the two leads are obvious - Tomei's character also recognises the degradation and humiliation attached to her job as she tries to maintain a body 'fit for purpose' in a job that she has to do to pay the bills. Rourke is the colossal star of the show here - he underplays his depair with a magical touch and we root for him 100% despite him not wallowing in his vulnerabilities. The Academy Award voters must hang their heads in shame as never has an actor been more deserving of an award as Rourke. This is a phenomenal movie, and is highly recommended."
"lewiskendell","10","2","4","10 April 2010"," Outstanding!
","The Wrestler has been sitting on my computer for the past week or two, and after all the ruckus I've been hearing about Mickey Rourke's performance and his win at the Golden Globes, I thought I should stop being lazy and watch the film. I have to say, there's something to all the adoration that this movie has received. The Wrestler is solid through and through.<br/><br/>People who have followed Rourke's career see this as his big comeback. I've personally only seen him in Sin City prior to The Wrestler, so I think my experience with the movie was less tinged with nostalgia than that of a die hard Rourke fan. I'm proud to say that enjoyment of this film certainly doesn't depend on being a Rourke devotee.<br/><br/>The Wrestler is filmed in a realistic style that makes it seem almost like a documentary. The realism extends to the wrestling scenes, the dialogue, pretty much everything except the idiots who kept turning down private dances from Marisa Tomei (right, like that would ever happen). In my opinion, the realism is essentially what makes the film work. Rourke's reaction to his circumstances and his interactions with the people in his life are the bread and butter that keeps the film interesting.<br/><br/>Speaking of the people in his life, Marisa Tomei and Evan Rachel Wood are simply outstanding. They make the acting invisible and really make the documentary vibe even stronger. Nearly every scene they are in sticks out. They managed to be just as three dimensional as Rourke's character with significantly less screen time. Tomei is officially now one of my favorite actresses (and way too gorgeous to be 44 years old), and Wood is now on my list of talented young actresses to watch.<br/><br/>All in all, The Wrestler is a movie that I'm happy to recommend to any and everyone. It has so many memorable scenes: the day that Ram and his daughter spend together, his face as he looks at all the old, washed-up wrestlers at the autograph signing, and let's not forget the entire emotional end sequence. Do yourself a favor and watch The Wrestler, it's a genuine treat."
"Kookie_","10","2","4","22 January 2010"," The Wrestler
","Rating ***** Directed by Darren Aronofsky Starring Mickey Rourke, Marisa Tomei, Evan Rachel Wood<br/><br/>Two words: Mickey Rourke. If Humphrey Bogart was made for Casablanca, Mickey Rourke was made for The Wrestler. What do the two have in common? Neither won the Academy Award for best actor in a leading role. Here we see two guys who not only made it impossible for the performance to be more perfect, but lived the role. When we think of Casablanca, we think Bogart. 66 years later when we think The Wrestler, we think Mickey Rourke. What would have happened if Nicholas Cage would have stepped into the shoes of Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson? The answer is simple: nothing at all. Simple as pie. <br/><br/>Before going into further praise about the star man, Darren Aranofsky mastered a story about a washed-up wrestler twenty years after his prime. There is no better example than the film in question when it comes to ""less is more"". With a budget of $7,000,000 in an age where the average budget for a feature film running in the cinemas was rising from $60 million to $100 million, Aranofsky chose a style which allowed realism to reach the viewer's inner core. Much of the story accompanied by a shaking hand-held camera brings the coldness of the streets to life. The sounds and smells of the streets and of a roaring crowd reaches out like a light from the mist; it gives the viewer shivers. This is not a story made on paper, it is made through the reality of a broken down place in the life of The Ram. <br/><br/>There is no location more ideal than the streets of New Jersey that have seen better days; just like The Ram has. Shot in only 35 days, The Wrestler uncovers the back rooms of old buildings, a trailer park, a strip joint, a peer with a ferris wheel near by (which also has seen better days) and in the home of wild wrestling-maniac's. He has come into terms that he no longer empowers the physicality that his former self once did. But for The Ram, this is all he has. He tries the best he can to look younger by dyeing his hair, going to the solarium and lifting weights in clear anguish. This is a man that has failed in life and has nothing left to lose but his little left health. And he knows it. <br/><br/>The storyline evolves around the man himself, but also around the few people in his life. His daughter played well by Wood, the stripper and the woman of his life also performed brilliantly by Tomei, and the whole wrestling community. While he can't win over his daughter or the love of Tomei's character Cassidy, it seems as if he is destined to go out doing what he loves the most. Wrestle. He may have aged, but his passion has stayed the same. The younger wrestlers respect him and the fans love him. When he stands on the ropes while the crowd chants ""Ram Jam! Ram Jam!"", his broken down heart is filled with love rather than (physical) pain. If it were to make the people who love him happy, it would be worth it. He is The Ram and The Ram will give the fans what they want. <br/><br/>This is not a performance made by an actor who simply seemed suitable for the role, but by a man who has literally lived the life of The Ram. While The Ram gets his comeback, so does Rourke, and boy does he deliver. If there ever was a performance that should be recognized, it should be this one. Hands down. Rourke doesn't deliver a performance, he delivers reality. He is ""an old broken down piece of meat"" and he has ""burned the candle at both ends"" and that is exactly why it makes the role of The Ram more life-like. The viewer knows this. While someone may criticize for him not playing a role but more playing himself, it makes absolutely no difference at all. If you put something on the screen and it works, what more can you ask? Where is that golden statue? <br/><br/>There is no better ending that comes to mind within the 2000's (except for maybe Brokeback Mountain). A good ending is an ending that evokes emotions (good or bad). When Bruce Springsteen's ""The Wrestler"" fills the air, the viewer is left with only assumptions. The screen turns black and The Ram is no longer with us. Perfection."

"eddax","10","2","4","27 May 2009"," The perfect comeback vehicle for Mickey Rourke.
","I wonder if this movie would've been as high profile if it weren't for its lead. Even its critically popular director, Darren Aronofsky, wouldn't have been able to draw as much attention to The Wrestler if it weren't for Mickey Rourke.<br/><br/>Hollywood loves its comeback stories, and The Wrestler is perhaps the best comeback vehicle that Rourke - a former championship boxer whose face has been rearranged many times - could've hoped for. It's about a wrestler who has only known professional wrestling all his life, but after a heart attack, has to come to terms with retirement. He subsequently - and unsuccessfully - tries to maintain a regular but demeaning job, woo a world-weary stripper, and reunite with his estranged daughter.<br/><br/>It's a huge role that requires a man to exude tremendous amounts of both masculinity and vulnerability and Rourke manages to, which justifies all the accolades he has garnered. Complementing him are the supporting actresses, Marisa Tomei and Evan Rachel Wood as the stripper and his daughter respectively, though they are much overshadowed by Rourke and Tomei's bare boobs.<br/><br/>Though I probably wouldn't have watched such a movie if it weren't Oscar-nominated, it was worth watching for its performances, and also for its insight into pro-wrestling - how it's faked and how its fans are rabidly in denial about it. The ending was also particularly poignant and memorable, and I was surprised to realize how much I had come to sympathize with the wrestler, much to Rourke and Aronofsky's credit."

"Rafacus","10","2","4","10 May 2009"," The Wrestler in essence is a tragedy, being that it is so absolutely real
","The Wrestler is the type of film that makes movies the special part of life that they are. The ability of an actor, script, music and cinematography to pull at our emotional strings and force us to feel remorse or happiness for a fictional character is amazing. It is amazing but unfortunately a rarity in the hundreds of movies pumped out every year, but once in awhile you stumble on a gem, and that gem renews your faith not only in the industry but in the art of story telling.<br/><br/>It is the clich√©d tale of the mighty warrior falling from glory. The gladiator who has grown old and tired, too damaged to please the adoring crowd and too alien to the normality of life to do anything else. It is the story we are shown quite often but rarely do we get the reality of such a situation. It makes you wonder why boxers way past their primes come back to the ring and NFL players who are past effectiveness refusing to retire. It is something foreign to the everyday man who has not endured the bumps and bruises of a life of pain in entertainment to please the adoring crowd. The Wrestler is such a tale, allowing us for a few moments to see the candid truths of a professional wrestler in the twilight years of his career.<br/><br/>Having known some wrestlers in my time period, I already knew this tale. Well documented by scenes in documentaries such as Beyond The Mat, I know that an older wrestler is normally broke, heavily reliant on drugs and damn near suicidal. With the exception of Hulk Hogan and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, you will be hard pressed to find retired wrestlers who are living comfortably through the fruits of their labor. The Wrestler allows us to be a fly on the wall in the life of one of the unlucky old-timers.<br/><br/>Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson (Mickey Rourke) is a professional wrestler with a long career of success behind him. With the old aches and age finally dragging him down, Randy is unable to keep up with life outside the ring and spends nights sleeping in his van. His hopes of returning to stardom leads him to doing small independent shows for little to no money until he is hit with a severe health issue. In a vain attempt to retire and live normal life, Randy pursues a relationship with Cassidy/Pam (Marisa Tomei) a dancer at the Strip Club he frequents and his estranged daughter Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood). Unfortunately regular life and Randy do not mix well and he is forced to fall back on the only people who have always been there for him¬Ö the crowd.<br/><br/>The Wrestler in essence is a tragedy, being that it is so absolutely real it feels more documentary than motion picture. Mickey Rourke is perfect and so believable that had he not been a famous actor it would be hard pressed for you to convince me that ""The Ram"" wasn't a real person. Not only is Marisa Tomei absolutely beautiful in this film but she brings a real humanity to Cassidy that ran parallels to some of the working girls I know in life. The movie was powerfully realistic and relevant and I think it will bring some much needed attention to the entertainment/sport of pro wrestling. To top it off the score is so melancholy and appropriate that it plays with your emotions as much as the action on screen.<br/><br/>This is not a rental folks, this is a purchase and treasured film for your collection. I am very glad to have seen it and with the low budget used to film it¬Ö shows that a tough story and an actor that can pull it off is all that is needed for cinema gold.<br/><br/>Moe reviews from Rafacus at www.SpicyMovieDogs.com"
"tonymurphylee","Null","2","4","25 January 2009"," The best film of 2008
","Randy the Ram is a famous wrestler who has been involved in the sport of professional wrestling for several decades. Wrestling has taken it's toll on his body. With the combination of injury, drug use, and over-exertion, Randy's body has deteriorated over the years to the point where he can no longer wrestle according to the doctor's orders. Left with nothing to do, Randy decides to get his work hours extended at the local deli, tries to get closer to his best friend, Cassidy, who is a stripper, and decides to try and repair his bad relationship with his daughter, Stephanie. However, living in the real world may be too daunting a task for Randy. <br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky's The Wrestler is an uncompromising vision of life. We don't just see the downfall of Randy as much as we witness it. We see him backstage with his wrestling partners and we see them as very close and more comfortable with each other and knowledgeable of each other's bodies and their fighting styles. Then we see Randy and Cassidy and we see the juxtaposing of the wrestling lifestyle and the stripper lifestyle and we see how strangely similar they are. They both are entertainers and their bodies are the entertainment. We see Randy work at the deli and he has the same high energy and forceful nature that he does in the ring. We see Randy with his daughter and what we see looks like a bad train wreck. We don't see any relation, any chemistry, or anything in common with these two people. These are two completely different people. Randy is a mass of muscles, greasy hair, and large clothes. Stephanie is beautiful, young, smart, and it is suggested that she is a homosexual. <br/><br/>As the film goes along, we see all these common elements of Randy's life completely fall apart. We slowly come to the realization that he needs to wrestle in order for him to be able to manage his life. Randy is an entertainer and he was born to entertain. Unlike Cassidy, however, he goes to extreme lengths to entertain. He allows his body to be ripped to shreds. As part of the world of wrestling, he must hide razor blades in his wrist straps in order for him to take it out and slash his face. We see him get nearly ripped open with barbed wire on one scene. The gory scenes in The Wrestler could rival the endless scenes of mutilation in The Passion of the Christ, which is even referenced in one scene by the Cassidy character. <br/><br/>The second half of the film is extremely intense in it's unfolding of events. While we know that Randy is not able to function that well outside of wrestling, his lack of order, structure, and discipline soon takes an even bigger toll on him than the injuries he gets in the ring. His fall from grace is difficult to watch in it's honesty and the film is unsparing in it's distraught nature. There is no time for the audience to breathe. We witness the battle and, when it ends, we aren't fully sure if it was worth it. It doesn't matter though, because what we saw was exactly what a good film should be. <br/><br/>The Wrestler is a fascinating and harrowing piece of film-making. Micky Rourke practically plays himself and it is a fearless piece of acting. Marisa Tomei and Even Rachel Wood both come off just as strong. The film is so fascinating to watch. We feel privileged to see this life that is so different from our own. We are shown sides of people that we would never never see, not even if they were our brothers or sisters. The attention to detail and the gritty camera-work only add to the authentic feel. The soundtrack is incredibly memorable and fits so well with the character of Randy. <br/><br/>All of these elements lead up to an ending that, I think, is one of the year's best. While many people will hate the ending to this film, many will also love it. It's the kind of ending that rings so true and has so much power in it's hard hitting nature. I felt happier at the end of this film than I did to the ending of any big budget Hollywood Blockbuster. The Wrestler is a one-of-a-kind masterpiece and it is the best film of 2008."
"Polaris_DiB","10","2","4","18 January 2009"," Heart and humanity from the director who has yet to do wrong
","Darren Aronofsky has largely made a career of putting his audience into the POV of his topics, from the migraine-induced paranoia of pi to the draining addiction of Requiem for a Dream to the spiritual fascination of The Fountain and now, to the momentum-fueled downfall of The Wrestler. Ten minutes into this film and I knew here was a film destined, yet again, to be underrated. Critics are praising Mickey Rourke's performance right and left, but Aronofsky is a risk-taking director and doesn't exactly play it easy here. Most of this movie is an over-the-shoulder perspective of Rourke's shambling form, and though most critics will probably interpret this as aiming for a pseudo-documentary effect, I hope the introspective nature of it isn't lost on too many people--here, the audience is made to feel the hulking weight of The Ram's form as their own body, with his stuttered breathing and pained lip-smacking creating austere ambiance.<br/><br/>Once again Aronofsky shows off his acumen both in the stylistic directing of the movie itself plus with an intelligent and sincere screenplay. Some high-notes of the genre are hit, from the estranged daughter to the heart-of-gold stripper to minor drug use, but none of it comes off as sentimental and this is definitely not Rocky whatever-number-we're-on. Aronofsky is interested mostly in showing people who've lost the one thing that gives them talent (their body) slowly destruct their minds. The flag-waving spectatorship cues weirdly inherent in most movies is kept to the background, but the blue-collar sensibility is held dear and given more room and, frankly, more humanity and reality than just taking it for granted. Of all of Aronofsky's works, this is one with a specific voice, and Rourke inhabits that voice so well that I do have to agree with the lauding critics and mention that Mickey Rourke deserves an Oscar for this role.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, it's emotionally devastating, but this time with an endearing humanism that makes it a lot easier to stomach than Requiem for a Dream. The problem getting people's interest in Aronofsky is that he doesn't play easy with his audience, and as a highly idiosyncratic director, is very hard to introduce. Finally he's come up with a movie that it seems almost anybody can really enjoy and appreciate, except for the problem that people just simply don't like movies that stay on the back of characters' heads (the same unfair criticism got shoved on Punch Drunk Love) and are willing to be as blunt as this. Nonetheless, this movie is amazingly crafty and endearing. I recommend it heartily.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"
"frankenbenz","9","2","4","13 January 2009"," The Return of the King
","http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky's The Wrestler is probably the best American film of 2008 and in it, Mickey Rourke delivers perhaps the best performance of 2008. Significantly, The Wrestler announces two important things: 1) Aronofsky has put behind him his film student fixation with gimmicky camera and editing techniques in favor of honest, straight forward film-making and 2) Mickey Rourke is back from the dead.<br/><br/>In case you forgot (or are too young to remember), Rourke was once Hollywood's golden boy, a pretty face with more talent than any of his peers. At the time, the comparisons to Brando were inevitable, but they were also justified - Rourke was an exceptional talent. Just like Brando, Rourke's demons got the worse of him and the drugs, drink, and inexplicable detour into prize fighting, devastated both the man and his once promising career.<br/><br/>In The Wrestler, Rourke plays Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson, a character so achingly human, you can't resist caring for, crying for and cheering for him. Credit this empathy to Rourke who invests everything in his portrayal of Ram. There's little doubt why Aronofsky cast Rourke as Ram - simply put, Rourke is Ram. And just like Ram, Rourke isn't capable of mailing in a performance; Ram sacrifices everything for his adoring fan, just as Rourke is willing to put everything on table to make The Ram real. When Ram tearfully acknowledges to his estranged daughter (Rachel Evan Wood) he screwed up, he hurt people, he hurt himself and that he regrets the price he's paid for his mistakes, it is obvious Rourke is plumbing the depths of his own despair.<br/><br/>Rourke's ravaged face is a testament to how badly this man has had the sh## kicked out of him in both the boxing ring and in life. This face isn't the creation of a prosthetics or make- up artist, this is the face of a man with a past, with pain and, tragically, with very few people left to love him. This too is The Ram and this verisimilitude is precisely why The Wrestler is destined to be an American classic. It is a surprisingly tender, unpredictable and heart-felt emotional ride about a fallen idol from the 1980s, starring a fallen idol from the 1980s. With luck, this personal piece of work will be as cathartic to Rourke as it is for his fans. If so, welcome back Mickey...you've been missed."
"zetes","7","2","4","11 January 2009"," Too familiar in its story to be a really great movie
","A small film about a big man. Mickey Rourke is, as you've certainly heard, outstanding as an aging wrestler who was famous back in the '80s and still plugs along at small events. Small those events may be, but they don't skip on the showmanship. One particularly brutal match rubs out the possibility of any more, and he has to take his life into perspective. He tries to reconnect with his estranged daughter (Evan Rachel Wood) and form a real relationship with a frequently-visited stripper (Marisa Tomei). Frankly, my opinion of the film is lower than that of most who have seen it. When The Wrestler focuses on wrestling, it's spectacular. It's very detail-oriented, and you can just sense how much Rourke, the big lug, loves it. And the aforementioned brutal match is sure to be one of the most shocking things you'll see in any 2008 film. I rarely am disturbed by what I see in a movie, but I was wincing hard at it. When the plot kicks in, though, I just found it to be utterly predictable. It's made out of three basic clich√©s: the old pro who desperately wants to re-achieve his former glory, the family member connecting with an estranged family member and the sex worker unsure of whether she should cross the line between her profession and her feelings. I could never get very excited about it, because I felt I knew exactly where it was going and I never was wrong."

","Hittin' The Ropes #8: Who's to Blame for the Tragedy of ""The Wrestler"" Growing up in the 80s and 90s, I truly feel this film is directed toward my demographic. Of course any wrestling, or more specifically ""mark"", should benefit from watching a film of this caliber and character. As a childhood wrestling fan, especially in the 80s, the men I saw on the screen were superheroes. They were 5 times larger than anyone I had seen in person. They wore clothes that were bright, flashy and cool. They exhibited incredible feats of strength and flew threw the air better than Michael Jordan ever could. When I was a child, wrestling was my cartoons. It was my comic books. It was my life. But I never gave these men a second thought after they walked off of my TV screen. I didn't know and want to know what they did in their hotel rooms or the local bars. I didn't care which top star was campaigning for himself over some other younger, more talented guys. It wouldn't even cross my mind that all these guys weren't just NATURALLY superhuman. They were my heroes and no one could convince me otherwise.<br/><br/>Fast-forward about 2 decades later and look where we stand. No longer is there the steel curtain between the audience and backstage. Most fans know the outcomes are predetermined. Most know there are writers, some directly from Hollywood. Most know there is more politicking backstage then all of D.C. And yet, we still defend what we love. I don't know how many times I had to explain to someone that the blood in the ring wasn't ""fake."" We're still fans. We still watch every week to escape from reality for a little while but now there's something else always in the back of our minds. When you see Triple H on screen, you know he's married to the boss' daughter. When you see Jeff Hardy, you know he's a rebel who is one strike away from fading into obscurity. And when you see Kurt Angle, you know a man with that many broken necks would never be able to survive a fight with someone like Samoa Joe. But who cares? We suspend that belief and that's all that matter. Too bad that belief is what might be killing these men.<br/><br/>""The Wrestler"" is phenomenal. I had the great opportunity to watch this film with my girlfriend who knows enough about wrestling to understand what's going on but not really anything that happens behind the scenes. She cringed when Randy removed the razor to blade his own forehead and she almost had to leave the room during the hardcore/CZW match. What made it worse was when I told her these matches actually do exist. For me, this type of violence and sensationalism has been a part of the business since ECW and backyard wrestling. It was eye-opening to see someone experience this who had never heard of it before. I cannot say enough nice things about Mickey Rourke's performance in this role. Being around behind the scenes of the business for the little time I was, I saw too many men that mirrored Randy's dead-eyed look he had in between entertaining the masses. I can remember walking through the WWE TV studios and seeing an ECW ""legend"" talking on his phone and just staring off into space. He sat there for 3 straight hours. 2 days later was a television taping and he looked like a brand new man. Now I can't be sure he wasn't just having a bad day earlier in the week but it seemed like once he walked into that arena and heard a sea of people cheering for something he loved to do, he realized just why he lives this hell. He lives this hell for us. To entertain us and everything else takes a back seat. ""The Wrestler"" portrays this perfectly with Randy's desire for that one last match, his ability to turn a mundane meat cutting job into a show and his strained, failed relationship with his own daughter. Being a fan and student of wrestling, I knew how this story would end. But that didn't make the journey any less heart wrenching and poignant.<br/><br/>""The Wrestler"" is sad. It's beautiful and it's hard to watch. But most of all, it's history. It might not be film history, although I will argue that it ranks up there with some of the best films in the last 20 years. No this film is wrestling history. It brings to life all of the biographies of the past few years. It brings to life all the whispers we've heard of old-timers looking for one more shot at stardom. It brings to life the good and bad of everything wrestling. Pro-wrestling gave Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson a life. It also slowly took it away. A story all too true and sad. But the one thing I was asking myself after watching this film was is Randy really to blame for his addiction to the sport he loves? Or was it my fault for expecting far too much of men who I wanted to be superhuman? So what do you think? Agree? Disagree? Let me know!

Every time there is a happy ending, I (generally) think that the film was unrealistic. I sit there, watching my movie hoping that there is no happy ending.<br/><br/>Now, to the Wrestler, without giving away the ending, or whether it is happy or sad or neutral, or whatever, the Wrestler is one of very few movies that I have sat there and hoped for a fairy tale ending. Micky Rourke made me care for his Randy the Ram character so much, that I wished during the movie that the Director and/or Writer (not God, lol)would say: ""Geez, Ram, you've been through so much that you deserve to have everything you want.""

However, that dirt and destitution is not without cleansing, hope, repentance, forgiveness, and optimism.<br/><br/>It's predominantly observatory, as if the camera acts like a fly on the wall for audiences to merely taste the life of this very ""real"" person. Overall, the film basks in a supernal light because it paints ugly people in beautiful colors. It gives a voice to the voiceless and shatters the stereotypes of wrestlers, strippers, drug abusers and bastard children. Truly humbling! Aaronofsky continues to amaze me with his dynamic film-making style. It's very unlike anything he's done before (independent of the gritty and raw edges he provides for his characters though). This might be his best film yet."
"blazesuncaster","10","0","0","14 May 2020"," Amazing
","This movie was amazing, it tells an awesome story about an ex wrestler who was very famous in his time, but who is now broke and wrestles at small gigs to make extra money to live out the rest of his life. He gives up wrestling after he finds out he had a heart attack from his last event and can't wrestle due to his heart. Randy also had a love interest who is a stripper, her name is Pam. What's so amazing about these two characters is that they tell the same story, both are in their older years, Pam being in her forty's and people don't want her to dance for them because she's warn out. With Randy, he was in his prime 20 years ago but now he is just an old man who doesn't have anyone anymore. So both characters share ""old and used up"" traits. Randy got in contact with his daughter because he still had a lot of guilt never being there for her, and the connection they share is amazing because it truly shows that she wants to love him and wants to have the dad she never had. Randy had forgotten about a dinner he had planned with his daughter and that was it for him, she didn't want anything to do with him. At the end of the story the true message of the story is that ""you only have one life, you choose it"" Randy chose wrestling. I know this was a different review but I really wanted to tell the story in a couple paragraphs. Definitely watch this if you haven't."

People generally have passions, hobbies, and interests because of what it serves to them. Not only do they like the subject or field that they can enjoy, they serve as a distraction to the real world and the hostility reality can present to us. The Wrestler embodies this with a washed up man who's past his prime and has made hard mistakes in his life.

"ethanbresnett","9","0","0","19 April 2020"," Its a cliche... but this really is a must see movie!
","The Wrestler is a really thoughtful and well considered film. The plot is relatively simple and the film is all the better for it. Rourke plays a wrestler whose glory days are far behind him, now trying to earn a living working in a supermarket on weekdays and back in the ring in less than glamourous venues on the weekends.<br/><br/>I always find the world of wrestling fascinating, and The Wrestler shows us behind the curtain in a way I haven't seen in other films before. The physical toil that these men put themselves through is laid bare in a gruesome and devastating fashion, Aronofsky doesn't shy away from the harsh realities of wrestling at all. This is not to say the film is gratuitous at all. Demonstrating this reality is so crucial to the story as Randy would rather deal with the physical pain of wrestling than the emotional void that he would endure if he were to leave it behind.<br/><br/>The Wrestler is an emotional and tragic ride in many ways, with Randy trying to find a sense of purpose and belonging without wrestling, coming to terms with the man he was, is, and will be. A lot of this centres around his relationships with Marisa Tomei's Cassidy and with his estranged daughter. Both support Rourke incredibly well, but it really is his show and the Academy nomination couldn't be more deserved (I'm yet to see Milk but Penn must have been pretty spectacular to edge Rourke out). You can just see the pain in many of these interactions oozing from him, and throughout the film you get the sense that this man is carrying a huge weight on his shoulders, trying not to let himself be defeated by life. Wherever Randy turns he can neither find peace or contentment, and his struggle is so painful to watch, and his interactions with his daughter so heart breaking. He's a character that you really root for despite his flaws, and as a result the film is so engaging.<br/><br/>I also absolutely loved the camera work in this film. It was quite rough and gritty at times, often quite close and invasive. The only other Aronofsky film I've seen is Black Swan, and there are many similarities in the direction to that, putting character front and centre. Ultimately a lot of similarities in the films more widely as well, showing us behind the scenes of two professional performers, albeit at very different stages of their careers.<br/><br/>This film is one of the great sports movies, and just movies more generally, deserving all the praise it gets. Watch it, enjoy it, savour it."

"bock_g","10","0","0","26 February 2020"," An irrefutable masterpiece
","There are several films I come back to watch when I feel down and out--""The Wrestler"" is one of them. The story follows Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson (played by the legendary Mickey Rourke) a wrestler whose past his prime and is barely keeping his feet together. He fights in small town arenas, gets juiced up on steroids, works at a supermarket in the daytime, and is constantly locked out of his trailer home because he's short in cash. He also has some feelings for Cassidy (played brilliantly by Marisa Tomei)-a stripper who in someways parallels Randy's life. Both characters are like able despite their downsides but unlike ""Rocky ""where everything despite the odds goes fairly well, ""The Wrestler"" constantly pins you down with reality. After a particularly brutal and graphic match, Randy suffers a heart attack which almost kills him. Feeling he's past his physical limitation, Randy retires from Wrestling and tries to make amends with his estranged daughter Stephanie (played by Evan Rachel Wood). With the help from Cassidy, Ram is able to reconcile with his daughter. At the same time, Randy reveals his feelings for Cassidy in part to thank her for helping him reconcile with his daughter. Cassidy, despite having mutual feelings rejects Randy's advances in trying to maintain her professionalism. This angers Randy and he promptly goes out to party-eventually causing him to miss his dinner with his daughter. This irreparably breaks up his relationship with his daughter, and things begin to fall apart again. After being somewhat heckled by a customer at a deli counter he worked at, Randy quits his day job and goes back up to the ring to wrestle. Cassidy also promptly quits her job to chase after Randy to have him stop wrestling. She reveals her true feelings, but that doesn't stop Randy from going to the ring. After a heartwarming speech, Randy wrestles but his heart can't take the beatings like before. In a fatal move, Randy leaps from the corner, performing his signature move, the Ram Jam and the film freezes to the credits where Bruce Springsteen's amazing title song plays along. Everything from the performances, the camerawork, the editing, the music, and most importantly the direction is all top notch. While this is unofficially considered a companion piece to ""Black Swan""-I personally think this film conveys a greater message which is that there's always a place where people belong no matter how brutal and hard it can be to live life. This is a masterpiece."

"mkm-hermanjnr","8","0","0","25 January 2020"," Aronofsky crafts another realistic-yet-surreal nightmare
","Darren Aronofsky has a very particular talent for structuring films in which characters seem to be pitted against not only the flaws of their own nature, but the crushing weight of reality itself.
My Score: 8/10.<br/><br/>My analysis of the film below (contains spoilers):<br/><br/>Ageing wrestler Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson (Mickey Rourke) is still pulling wrestling gigs even in his late middle age. He needs the cash, but he also loves his fans and the wrestling scene and that seems to be his main drive. Physically he looks pretty good for his age, but it's clear that he's unable to take the beatings like he used to, and his physique is maintained with a vast cocktail of illegal drugs and a punishing physical regimen. His personal life is sad, hollow and empty, and he spends his evenings visiting a sleazy strip club. Usually he tries to get a dance from his favourite girl, Cassidy (Marisa Tomei).<br/><br/>Cassidy is in many ways a mirror of Randy. An older stripper, she's stuck in a no-future job where she is essentially a piece of meat for a crowd that's not particularly bothered about her outside of her ability to entertain them. Her story is strong and interesting in it's own right, perhaps the only flaw is the casting of Marisa Tomei.<br/><br/>Not because of her acting - she's a good actress and does well in the part. But she's a gorgeous woman and doesn't really fit the bill for a washed up stripper! I'm sure pretty much any young man in his prime would be happy getting a dance from her, so it's kind of weird to see characters telling her she looks unattractive.<br/><br/>Much like in Requiem For A Dream, the film is about characters who are fundamentally doomed due to their own flaws (or inability to face up to these flaws), coupled with a harsh and brutal world that makes no exceptions for them. In fact, the environment around the characters appears to actively conspire to drive them even further into despair. As strange as it might sound, the two movies feel to me like they're set in the same universe thanks to the similar themes and direction.<br/><br/>What The Wrestler does differently to that film is that it uses an ambiguous ending to poses a question to the viewer about the principle character, rather than giving you a straight answer. Is he a hero? Is he brave? Is he selfless? Or is he stupid and selfish? Is he all of these things?<br/><br/>Randy carries the movie as a complicated and interesting character. Most obviously, he is a man trapped in the past; from his choice of crusty old videogames to his nostalgia for upbeat 80's rock that clashes completely with his downbeat place in this present world.<br/><br/>I would further describe him as a man with a massive heart and a strong sense of pride, but also a naivety and devastating lack of common sense about him. In a way, his flaw is that he loves his fans too much, he loves Cassidy too much, and he doesn't think enough. To quote The Matrix, he uses ""every muscle except for the one that counts"".<br/><br/>Randy is a great guy in many ways, but he's also, quite frankly, a meathead. In the 80's (which we don't see) presumably this didn't matter; he was able to goof and joke around, spend large amounts of money and be a Good-Times-Guy. When The Wrestler starts, we see this Good-Times-Guy without the good times, and it's harsh and depressing. It's this sort of cheerful but unthinking demeanour that partially lands Randy in such a sad and desperate situation.<br/><br/>In one of Cassidy's first scenes she extols Randy's virtues, comparing his suffering for his fans in the ring to the suffering of Jesus. This is actually an apt comparison, though she makes it in jest.<br/><br/>As I mentioned previously, Aronofsky twists a cruel reality into victimising the characters directly. The ""hardcore match"" in which Randy is brutally smashed with barbed wire and blunt objects almost feels like a re-run of the disturbing sex party from Requiem, in terms of the amount Randy is physically violated for a baying and desensitised crowd. The frenzied shouts of ""USE HIS LEG!"" very much reminded me of ""FEED ME, SARA!""<br/><br/>Similarly, Randy's boss at his day job is an incredibly obnoxious and unreasonable man. He's everything Randy isn't; cruel, petty, vindictive, lazy and calculating. Even Randy's customers belittle and abuse him, driving him further to the precipice. In fact the world seems so cruel that it starts to break the realism of the film, but as with Requiem, this is used deliberately by Aronofsky to give us a surreal, nightmarish exaggeration of reality. The incredibly bleak and uncompromising world of the movie makes the film more compelling still rather than worse.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Randy also victimises himself when the world isn't doing it for him. His nostalgia and lust to regain his past popularity can be extremely self-destructive and idiotic. His limp attempt to relive his 80's glory days with some casual sex and a snort of cocaine ends with him spectacularly crashing, permanently, out of his daughter's life. Serving as perhaps the most heartbreaking scene of the film, Randy seems powerless to rein himself in from plunging right over the cliff the audience saw coming 20 minutes ago. It's like watching a train wreck.<br/><br/>The ending, however, is perhaps the most interesting climax of his character. Cassidy offers him her love, but Randy refuses to give up his one last big moment in the ring, announcing the world doesn't care about him. Before making his (potentially fatal due to a heart condition) final leap from the ropes, Randy looks for Cassidy and sees she has gone.<br/><br/>Is it her fault for not being there for him? Is that why he leaps? Or is it his fault that she left, given his stubborn and pig-headed fixation on his last match? Was the world against him, or was he against himself?<br/><br/>All in all, a good film that raises many questions about the human spirit. I continue to rate Aronofsky highly, and I recommend this movie."

"DeuceWild_77","10","0","0","26 December 2019"," Little gem of a film, a brilliantly directed character's study about highs and lows with a remarkable performance by Rourke, who transcends the material !!
","Darren Aronofsky is a daring filmmaker, he knows how to stage cinema, both visually & technically, and how to defy the 'genres' at the same time, and above all, he's a magnificent director of actors (Ellen Burstyn in ""Requiem for a Dream"", '00 or Natalie Portman in ""Black Swan"", '10, being great examples of that).<br/><br/>In ""The Wrestler"", Aronofsky once again scored high in every department, starting with the 'risqu√©e' casting of Mickey Rourke, one of the best post-Brando performers which, unfortunately, his genuine behavior against fake posing and politics in Hollywood and the sincere passion for the method performance itself costed him his leading status and then his career, and Aronofsky's own 'cinema v√©rit√©' style of directing mixed with 'guerrilla filmmaking' approach that transcends the american roots of the Wrestling Entertainment to an 'artsy' film more European inclined.<br/><br/>The original actor hired by the producers, Nicolas Cage, backed out from the movie when he knew that Aronofsky's heart was with Mickey, his old pal from Francis Ford Coppola's ""Rumble Fish"" ('83), and doing that, he was partially responsible for the film's success and for the resurrection of Rourke, who never really stopped acting, but was 'blackballed' to short cameo appearances in mostly indie films, even if he acted his heart and soul out regardless of his screen time (such as in Terrence Malick's ""The Thin Red Line"" ('98); as Jan the Actress in Steve Buscemi's ""Animal Factory"" ('00); as Jim Olstad in Sean Penn's ""The Pledge"" ('01) or as The Cook in Jonas √Ökerlund's ""Spun"" ('02).<br/><br/>Aronofsky knew that the 'washed-out' / 'has-been' character of Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson parallel Mickey's own descent into darkness, and both the character and the actor share the memories of the glourious and glamorous days of their stardom in the exuberant 80's and carrying nowadays the stigma that they not fit anymore because the world have changed (surely, not for good, in this reviewer's opinion) and years of self destructive behavior and premature aging due to that did not helped either.<br/><br/>It's an amazing 'tour de force', organic, realistic and remarkable performance that may be the best from that decade. Mickey gave it all (his best performed leading role since ""Johnny Handsome"", '89) and, finally, he was nominated and won every major awards, except the Academy Award due to the same politically correct that he fought against during his peak in the 80's decade.<br/><br/>The script, penned by Robert Siegel, is simplistic, but goes deeply emotionally and, even if it isn't perfect (the over-the-top reaction from the daughter and even the Ram's outburst in the supermarket) gave those actors the ambience to create their own characters and even their own improvised lines that enriched the film to the level of realism.<br/><br/>Marisa Tomei, who was also Oscar nominated for her brave role here as Pam / Cassidy, the stripper with a heart of gold, offers an inspired performance. She's real, both as a stripper (Mickey himself said that not every actress could be able to 'climb the pole' as perfectly as Marisa did) and as a single mom that wants to change her life and is afraid to fall in love with a former customer.<br/><br/>Evan Rachel Wood, the young co-star of ""Thirteen"" ('03) and ""The Missing"" ('03), plays Stephanie, Ram's estranged teenage daughter that he tries to reconnect. Wood goes a little over-the-top, especially in her last emotionally devastating scene with Rourke, but it's on the screenplay, not all her fault, she needed to react like that to provoque the Ram's decision in the third act.<br/><br/>The wrestling scenes are very well choreographed, some of the blood isn't even fake, and even if Aronofsky demanded a stunt double to protect his leading actor in some extreme wrestling sequences, Mickey himself at the age of 56 years old performed the majority of it.<br/><br/>In terms of the soundtrack, Rourke's old pals were there for him, Axl Rose gave the permission to use the Guns 'n' Roses' hit song, ""Sweet Child o'Mine"", played during Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson's entrance to his final match, and Bruce Springsteen even wrote and performed ""The Wrestler"", an original theme which was snubbed for an Academy Award Nomination for Best Original Song, both for free due to their friendship to Rourke and the movie's limited budget.<br/><br/>Other great 80's glam metal / AOR bands featuring in the movie are Quiet Riot, Ratt (when Mickey and Marisa dance in the bar listening to 'Round and Round'), FireHouse, Cinderella, Scorpions, Slaughter and Accept.<br/><br/>In short, ""The Wrestler"" is a brilliant little film, a taking on the dark side of America's most cheesy sport and a character study on a man that lost everything and search for his redemption in the only place he's still respected: in the ring!!<br/><br/>On a side note, Rourke's performance was lauded not only by professional critics, such as the late Roger Ebert, Owen Gleiberman, Ben Mankiewicz or Richard Roeper, and the audiences around the world, but also from his peers, from Al Pacino, Sean Penn, Sharon Stone, Sylvester Stallone, Brad Pitt to the Mickey's earlier co-star, Kim Basinger and even the WWE Chairman, Vince McMahon and former wrestling superstars as Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts, the late great ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper, Bret ""The Hitman"" Hart, Hulk Hogan, Mick Foley and ""The Narcissist"" Lex Luger, which his body was used in the opening credits to depicts Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson in the 80's.<br/><br/>I rarely give a 10 to a movie released post-2000, but if any movie deserves it, it is undoubtedly, ""The Wrestler"" !!"

","Emotional, that is the first time I felt after watching this movie. Just like what I felt after watching another sports movie like Rush (2013) and Warrior (2011), but maybe this is more heartwarming because more about family. Whether I miss this information or not, watching this movie enlightens my curiosity about wrestling like WWE SmackDown, WWE Raw, and something else which are all of those are not a pure fighting sport like UFC or boxing. Wrestling is a show and entertainment which is full of scenarios and acting by the wrestlers. Before the show begins, the wrestlers discuss with the promotors about how they will act and who takes over in each part of the show. Everything is done just to entertain the people. My childhood felt cheated because I used to watch wrestling shows like SmackDown and play them on game consoles, and I believed those all were real.<br/><br/>Besides that, this movie also tells the story behind the scenes about the wrestlers who fight in the ring. They are all good friends outside the ring even though in the ring they act separately as groups called Face (as a good-side) and Heel (as bad-side). Those who are usually labeled by the public as bad people in the ring are actually just an ordinary and friendly people. Mickey Rourke gave an awesome performance here, this is the best of all his career. I also felt what he feels from his face and eyes. His wistful expression made us believe that his character is a man full of life's problems. Even though this movie is about wrestling, we will witness more inner conflicts than physical conflicts. We will see how Ram wrestles in his real life as an ordinary person who also needs others by his side. For the movigoers regardless they like wrestling shows or not, watching this movie is surely a must."

"RussHog","10","0","0","15 November 2016"," One of the best movies ever made
","This great American drama is held together by Mickey Rourke's performance as a professional wrestler who is a dumb hulk with a big heart. He gives all of his love to his fans with his wrestling - and they give him all their love in return. Tragically, he suffers a heart attack and now he can no longer wrestle, and so he is left alone in a world where no one loves him.<br/><br/>He seeks companionship.<br/><br/>Everywhere he goes the companions he seek reject him. His neighbors. A stripper. Even his own daughter. <br/><br/>One day the stripper - who also has a big heart but exists in an industry where she cannot love her fans and her fans do not love her - takes a leap of faith to reach out to our hero. She agrees to spend time with him and encourages him to reconnect with his daughter. When he does - as if by miracle - the daughter accepts him back into her life. For a few brief days - he seems to be able to find love and accept the loss of his career as a wrestler. <br/><br/>Unfortunately - just when real love seems to surface these people fail to connect: He makes a pass at the stripper at the wrong time. She rejects him. He overreacts and verbally abuses her and then abuses drugs. The drugs make him miss out on a mission critical date with his daughter. The daughter overreacts and lashes out on our hero and throws him out of her life once again. The loss of love is sudden for all of them - and they are left alone.<br/><br/>Soon it becomes clear that our hero has destroyed his family - not once - but twice - and perhaps more times than that. He can only love to his fans - because that is the only world his talents as a big dumb hulk provide companionship.<br/><br/>Our hero decides he will go back into the ring to wrestle - even if it costs him his life. He would rather die in front of the fans who love him than be left alone in a world without love. But the stripper has a change of heart and reaches out to heal him one final time - but the damage done is too severe and he has to let her go so she can find a man in her life who will not harm her. He enters the ring - for one final match that may cost him his life.<br/><br/>On the one hand - this film is an allegory to the crucifixion of Jesus Christ - where our hero is a Christ-like figure who is beaten and mocked on his way to be nailed to a cross. <br/><br/>But on the other hand this is also a film about the lives of damaged human beings - the love that burns deep inside of them - and the struggle for their love to be recognized in order to find companionship. <br/><br/>It is perfect."

","Robin Ramzinski also known as Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson (Mickey Rourke) is a famous pro wrestler past his prime. He is now struggling with health problems, locked out of his trailer, working part-time at a supermarket and wrestling in smaller venues. He's possessive of aging stripper Cassidy (Marisa Tomei). After a tough match, he suffers from a near death heart attack. His medical issues force him to retire. He tries to work full-time at the supermarket, get serious with Cassidy and reconnect with his estranged daughter Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood).<br/><br/>There are some great insights into the world of professional wrestling. Aronofsky is doing a documentary style movie to heighten the reality of the character. Mickey Rourke is doing the role of a lifetime and something that was hinted at early in his career. It is a lifetime of hard living thrown onto the screen. It is the perfect marriage of the right actor and his ideal character. Marisa Tomei also puts in her best performance in quite awhile."
"fawn_jane","8","0","0","5 January 2015"," Touching, Heartfelt, genuine.
","Micky Rourke gives the performance of a lifetime. His acting is so perfect in this role, playing a figurative lovable old three-legged bulldog. His performance is so genuine, and filled with so much heart. He and Marisa Tomei both convincingly convey those down-to-earth, likable, hard-living old souls.<br/><br/>This movie gripped me from beginning to end, wanting to see what would happen next. That can be a challenge for a movie like this, which is on the surface kind of drab and sort-of has the feel of a budget documentary. The movie gets into your heart and makes you feel genuine sympathy for the protagonist and other characters.<br/><br/>But In hindsight, the movie suffers from a few over-used clich√©s. The movie does not have much of a plot, it mostly him trying to win the approval of the pretty women in his life. The movie outright ignores the value of male brotherly friendships, the setup is a bit trite and shallow. A guy like Randy, shouldn't he have more friends, more connections? It doesn't quite make sense for him to be alone. But that did not even occur to me until the movie was over, and I was done crying... What really carries the movie is Mickey Rourke and his superb performance.<br/><br/>This movie reminds me of Black Swan, there is a theme about glorifying and appreciating the struggles and sacrifices that athletes make in order to make it in their respective professions."
"Horst_In_Translation","8","0","0","10 December 2014"," Intense portrayal, very raw
","""Raw"" is probably one of the best adjectives to describe this movie and how Mickey Rourke as the central character, a washed-up wrestler, fights his very personal demons in this excellent portrayal of solitude. I could not imagine anybody more suitable for the part than Rourke. Great choice from Aronofsky picking him as Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson. Marisa Tomei (scored an Oscar nomination) and Evan Rachel Wood do a nice job with their roles as well and it was truly heartbreaking when Wood's character tells The Ram that she does not ever want to see him again. Tomei's character near the end seems the only way out of the misery for The Ram, but he chooses what he did all his life with probably tragic consequences. Mark Margolis plays a small part too and ""Breaking Bad"" fans will like it. Also we get to see Judah Friedlander from ""30 Rock"" in a totally different role.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky managed to get Rourke close to the Oscar for his portrayal here. It was a neck-and-neck race until the very end when Rourke lost the Oscar to Sean Penn's excellent portrayal of Harvey Milk. Aronofsky proved himself as an actor's director again. He got Portman the Oscar not much later and got a great performance out of Ellen Burstyn in ""Requiem for a Dream"" earlier in his career. Nice contrast between ""The Wrestler"" and ""Black Swan"" in terms of male vs. female sport professions. Robert D. Siegel wrote ""The Wrestler"" and there is some contrast with him too as he is mostly known for his work in terms of writing comedy and animation movies.<br/><br/>The whole film is narrated as if it was a documentary. It's a very intimate portrayal and this is one of the biggest strengths of the movie. Even if you cannot identify with the main character and oppose his actions, you still somehow develop a connection with him and his quest for happiness. At least I did. The refrigerated display case scenes with Rourke were among my favorites from the whole movie as they described Robinson's character so in detail. He is a volcano that can erupt any second positively or negatively, but when he does, it's huge.<br/><br/>Aside from The Ram's personal story, the film also gives great insight into the world of professional wrestling. Nothing we see in the ring is real. We witness how those who seem like the biggest foes in the ring are actually almost good friends who really care about the other's health and just want to come up with a good show for the audience. When Rourke's character talks about Bob (The Ayatollah), it's almost funny, because it is so different and normal compared to what people see happen in the ring, such as using a staple gun to harm your enemy. These scenes were actually quite graphic, so look away for a second if you struggle with violence in movies. But don't miss this film because of that. It would be quite a loss."

","Mickey Rourke always talked a good film role although a lot of his films were all hype and little by way of substance and entertainment value. Just try watching The Pope of Greenwich Village!<br/><br/>However after a few lean years with a detour into boxing and plenty of bad plastic surgery he gets a role to shine in with The Wrestler. He plays washed up, over the hill Randy Robinson known as The Ram. He was big in the late 1980s very much in the ilk of real wrestlers such as the Ultimate Warrior, he even had a video console game after him.<br/><br/>Although we are not told why times are rough and where his money went, he is now living in a trailer park, behind on his payments, working in a warehouse and in the weekends also working at the lower rungs of wrestling with other over the hill stars and some up and coming talent. Faraway from the world of arenas that he strutted a few decades earlier.<br/><br/>I assume his money went on wine, women, drugs and the good life. He is distant from his daughter who he abandoned when she was a kid and now spends his time in a strip club where he is friendly with Cassidy (Marisa Tomei) although she is not his girlfriend.<br/><br/>After a rough wrestling match he has a heart attack, he manages to get close with his daughter but he can never gel with her or Cassidy and with ailing health The Ram goes for a big pay wrestling match. He realises that the ring and the crowds is a life that he is comfortable with and at least gives him dignity.<br/><br/>It is interesting that in many ways The Ram is a nice guy. He is friendly to the kids in the trailer park, he gets on well with fellow wrestlers, he is tender with Cassidy and wants just to have good relationship with his daughter. He seems to have no obvious traits such as alcoholism, drugs, gambling etc. He does takes steroids, he goes to strip clubs. We only see him lose his temper when someone at the store recognised him when he was working behind the meat counter and he felt embarrassed.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky directs the film in a hand-held documentary style. It is low budget but he lets his three leads do the talking with their acting. Tomei comes off the best and is striking as the tattooed stripper, who is also commercially minded. She needs money for a better lifestyle. Even the guys playing wrestlers are good at their roles.<br/><br/>Mickey Rourke bulked up for this picture. He admits he juiced up to get so big so quickly. This was another shot at the big time and he got a deserved Oscar nomination, although I think Sean Penn was better in Milk.<br/><br/>This is a character study, a slow burn film, maybe at the end of the day it does not amount to much apart from a look at a character at the downside of his life."

","I went into this movie expecting it to be a 'Mans Movie' all action no character (nothing wrong with that). But it was much MUCH more, a beautiful story showing the life of a man who has spent his life getting beaten up. This movie connects with people firstly because deep down this is many peoples fear, being old, alone and struggling to find any bit of happiness. What gives this movie the extra stars is simply that there could not possibly be a more suited actor to play the lead role, half way through the movie I actually had to convince myself that this is not a movie about Mickey Rourke life of ups and mostly downs.<br/><br/>This movie is an unexpected emotional roller-coaster and one that I will never forget!!"
"bowmanblue","8","0","0","1 November 2014"," Tragic and poignant - is that really Mickey Rourke?
","Mickey Rourke may be an unusual choice for a leading man these days, but, upon watching The Wrestler, it was hard to imagine the film with anyone else.<br/><br/>He plays a 'burned out' wrestler whose glory days have long since passed him by. He lives in a trailer, works part-time at a local supermarket and barely sees his daughter. We watch as he tries desperately to form relationships and regain his career. Like people said that The Man Who Fell to Earth was basically about David Bowie playing a - slightly warped - version of himself, The Wrestler is effectively Mickey Rourke. He's seen his best - acting - days and is trying to climb back up the ladder - the hard way.<br/><br/>If you're not a fan of 'professional' wrestling, don't worry. The actual 'ring time' makes up about 12 minutes of a 1 hour 40 minutes film. And, what grappling there is, only proves the point that it's all fake and one big show for the people.<br/><br/>There's little to laugh at here. It's a sad tale of someone who has had a taste of the big life and lost it. Now he'll do anything to get it back. It's definitely not a feel-good movie. If you want something tragically poignant, where you root and feel sorry for the 'hero' all at the same time, try this. Mickey Rourke is more than just muscles."

","To be alone in old age or to wrestle at that age which is more painful?<br/><br/>The Wrestler is for Mickey Rourke. He is Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson and he played not just with a big heart but with a big body that took a lot of pain. Mickey, along with the director Darren Aronofsky (know for showing pain on screen) took me to one of the most painful trips and made me roam if at times in blood then at times in tears. surely this to my memory is the most painful movie the earlier one being Requiem for a Dream by the same director. You cannot watch such films again and again coz they make you freeze and uncomfortable. I dare did it twice.<br/><br/>When Danny Boyle said he wanted to do a wrestler kind of movie, 127 hours was born. That's when my interest began and was shell shocked by how real the whole act was in this film. At the second watch, I say it's still the same feeling. My eyes became moist at last scene each time.<br/><br/>Writing is good coz it's a clich√©d tale but the way director had interpreted the whole thing is simply worth a watch. My salutations to Darren Aronofsky, one of the few men who shows us things as they are without fabricating them much.<br/><br/>I had not seen this movie in 2008 so cannot comment much on if Mickey should have got an Oscar as I did not see ""The Milk"" yet for which, Sean Penn won the award. But surely it was a performance of a lifetime and to bear it all was real tough job and Mickey simply was Randy The Ram in every frame. The climax again (I mean like his other movies) is left for viewers interpretation by Darren and I would leave it without much interpretation.<br/><br/>All my accolades to Darren for conceiving and telling a tale in the most painful way possible. And many more kudos to Mickey to having played it and it was a real resurrection for him too who was back as recently in 2005 after a hiatus of 15 years.<br/><br/>Technically, the sound design was awesome and the cinematography was just as expected, it was not over the board but could have been much better. The dialogues are very clich√©d so to say coz that's what the character is too, so no qualms there. The screenplay is superb and so is editing please see how both worked for a film like this. Over and above everything was the acting that was so very natural by everyone.<br/><br/>Thanks Darren for showing this to us. It's 4/5. But I am not sure if ever I will see this agony and pain again."

","A broken down piece of meat? Mickey Rourke says that several times throughout the movie. And didn't everybody think Rourke was broken down in real life and as an actor? After this movie I can say he still has it. How can you argue? He shows not only is he still in tremendous shape but he can still give emotional depth to his characters. This is a fantastic movie that gives off every type of emotion you want from a film.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky is always a visually stunning director, and while this film doesn't have any huge set pieces it still benefits from a great script and beautifully directed intimate scenes between its leads. Maris Tomei and the daughter are great in their respected key scenes in the film. The 2 scenes with the daughter are devastating and you really start to feel for this big and not-so-good-looking wrestler who has his life torn away from him, even if it's basically at his own doing. It has to be one of if not Rourke's best and defining role in this business. If directors can only get him to do more of these types of roles, as I know I've heard it can be hard to work with him.<br/><br/>Even at it's emotional and depressing core it can be uplifting at the same time. The man knows he has put his life in the gutter and he's just trying to make the most of it. I really liked that he tells his daughter not only how sorry that he is but that he doesn't expect her to even have any love for him anymore. Because even when it's devastating it was at the same time satisfying, if that makes any sense. Love this movie and I highly recommend it.<br/><br/>9.2/10"

","""The Wrestler"" is a superior film that I would recommend to anyone. It is a character-driven story performed by a superior cast well-suited to their parts.<br/><br/>The central story is about two people, Randy ""The Ram"" and Cassidy, two well-crafted characters who have mismanaged their lives and have to deal every day with the realities that come with that.<br/><br/>Randy is portrayed by Mickey Rourke in a tour de force performance that blurs the lines between the character and the actor. ""The Wrestler"" is a comeback movie for Rourke, who bravely allows himself to be as vulnerable as an actor can be in depicting the washed-up wrestler. Randy still dresses and styles himself as the ring headliner of many years ago. His living quarters also reflect the lifestyle of a young man, though his face and body--bearing the scars of old battles--belie the truth. As age ravages his physical abilities and he is forced to face his own mortality, he tries to reenter the life of his estranged daughter. He also struggles to connect with a woman who is facing her own demons.<br/><br/>Cassidy, portrayed by Marisa Tomei, is a stripper who also must face the realities of her profession. Both of them are performers who daily fight Time to remain in professions designed for young people. Cassidy, like Randy, has the emotional scars of a long battle. She feels dehumanized by her job and, resignedly, recognizes the continuing reality that men do not see her as a real woman or a mother (to her young son). Marisa Tomei, as usual, finds the heart of her character and exposes it for the audience.<br/><br/>The film does a good job of placing these characters inside a world that is ruthless in its dehumanization of people. Randy takes a job at a grocery. The scenes in which his a**hole boss exacts his petty tokens of fealty are written with understatement and such an ear for truth. Some of the scenes of Randy manning the deli counter are with non-actor customers of an actual store.<br/><br/>""The Wrestler"" brings to the screen some of the toughest realities of life. The action is perfectly set in some real New Jersey locales, where Asbury Park and other locations have buildings and venues that are reminders of heydays long past. While the film celebrates the survivor instincts of Randy and Cassidy, it focuses on the demeaning trivialities of life and the undeniable degradation of time."

","I have to admit I may be a bit bias towards this film because I have watched pro wrestling most of my entire life so I would most definitely see this as an awesome film no matter what. However, this film is the film that has reinvented Mickey Rourke and made him a star again. The story of this film follows Rourke as an ageing wrestler who can't wrestle anymore and how he has to deal with his life. Now this film is all about one man and one performance and Rourke is absolutely superb in this film with his performance being the core that this film relies on and he is believable in all the situations that he is put in. The wrestling scenes are incredibly cool and I very much like the way the camera makes you feel like you are with Rourke the whole time as he goes on this journey. There is only a few negatives with the fact the film slows down quite a bit and also in my opinion the ending is quite abrupt with a few questions being unanswered but the longer I think about it I like the ending. So if you are a wrestling film then this film is a must see and if you are a Mickey Rourke fan this film is also a must see."

","The Wrestler. A faded professional wrestler, aptly cast and sincerely played by Mickey Rourke, who must retire finds his quest for a new life outside the ring a dispiriting struggle. The first half of the movie gives you insight into the life of wrestlers and tells you the show might look fake but performers are not fake. They are humans like us, they get hurt real bad, physically as well as mentally. Second half focuses on Mickey himself as he tries to fit in his life without wrestling. It is not an inspiring tale but a really gritty one for sure. The wrestling scenes are done in detail and leave a lasting impression of pain on you. However, movie gets a bit depressive and dark as we proceed towards the painful finale. Marisa Tomei lends heavy support in her role of Mickey's love interest.

","Filmed like a documentary, elegantly blending art n entertainment & taken to a whole new level by Mickey Rourke's career-resurrecting performance, The Wrestler is a wonderful testament to the incredible sacrifices so many professional athletes continue to make on a daily basis just for the sake of entertaining us, and is one of the best films of its year & Aronofsky's career.<br/><br/>The story of The Wrestler concerns Randy 'The Ram' Robinson; a washed-up professional wrestler who continues to cling on to his career despite his failing health with the hope of reliving the glory of his prime days. But when his condition worsens, he tries to settle with an alternate career outside the ring only to struggle with it & also attempts to mend his relationship with his estranged daughter.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky's direction is very impressive, screenplay is always focused on its lead character, cinematography & editing are in stealth mode compared to his previous features, fight choreography is excellent, Mansell's music doesn't have much of a presence this time yet is still effective in small doses but frankly, it's the performances that are the strongest aspects of this feature.<br/><br/>Presenting a fascinating cast in Mickey Rourke, Marisa Tomei & Evan Rachel Wood, it's Rourke who dominates the screen with a powerfully affecting performance that's as heartwarming as it is heartbreaking. Fusing elements of his own life with his on-screen persona, the sadness & emptiness he's able to bring into his work is absolutely mind-blowing and the film is totally his show from start to finish.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, covering the themes of passion, obsession, regret, sorrow, emptiness & redemption, The Wrestler is another effective drama from Darren Aronofsky that is a reflection of Mickey Rourke's own life brought alive on-screen. Being a wrestling fan myself who grew up enjoying the greatest era of WWE (Attitude Era, of course), The Wrestler is somewhat special for not just in wrestling fans around the world but also the wrestlers we grew up cheering for."

","This movie provides a glimpse into a life of an aging professional wrestler whose glory days are long behind him. Acting performance by Mickey Rurick is absolutely outstanding, perhaps because he can easily draw on experiences from his own life. It is easy to sympathize with him and you quickly get emotionally involved in his life's struggles. The atmosphere in the movie helps to transmit the themes of isolation and cruel realities of life. This movie is a character driven drama. The plot is pretty straightforward. It mainly serves to show different aspects of Rurick's character. Overall, this isn't a ground-breaking movie but it accomplishes everything it set out to do."

","This does show the darker side of a wrestler's life, but it is so realistic on what they go through. The sacrifice to their bodies, how they present themselves in the ring, what goes on before and after the match, missing family milestones. Mickey Rourke was perfect as this wrestler. He has that look that he has been taken a beating at a time or two. He made me believe that he is Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson AKA Ram Jam. To think that this role would have gone to Nicholas Cage. The scene when he had a heart attack shows what you do in that ring can affect your body. It also shows that this of job are more for the younger people and there is a stopping point but Randy only knows this world. Any fan of professional wrestling needs to see this."

","Professional wrestling. Fake. It is about putting on a show between a good guy and a bad guy. The bad guy often cheats and seems to have the upper hand, but the good guy comes in and scores a victory. The hero is then showered with cheers and applause. Randy ""the Ram"" (Mickey Rourke) is such a hero. What's real about professional wrestling is the event and glory that gets both the wrestlers' and fans' hearts' racing. So is the years and injuries. Randy ""the Ram"" has been a pro wrestler for nearly 25 years and his age and body is finally catching up to him.<br/><br/>The real reality for Randy is that he is past his prime. The film centers on this harsh aspect as well as the struggles he faces outside of the ring. These include trying to build a relationship with his estranged daughter (Rachel Evan Wood), working part-time at a super-market under an unwelcoming boss (Todd Barry), and seeking a friendship with a stripper (Marisa Tomei). To sum up, Randy is quite a lonely man. His only real enjoyment in life is in the ring. For him, that is his reality. This perspective in the story is what makes ""The Wrestler"" a good movie. As the viewer, we get to understand Randy, his motives, his pains, and his desires. <br/><br/>The success of such a character is clearly through Rourke's performance. Any person can look up Rourke's past life and see that it strongly reflects the character he plays. No doubt this works in his favor. He delivers a fine, honest, subtle, yet real performance. He lives and breathes as Randy on camera (and probably a bit off-camera). That is truly admirable of an actor, and not many can do it so truthfully. <br/><br/>Marisa Tomei is the other person who glimmers in the movie. Her character is not so much different than Randy. She is reaching the end of her years for her profession as a stripper and she needs to move on. Unlike Randy, she has reasons and desires to press on to other things after wards. Randy has to live in the moment like a true showman. The interaction between both actors on-camera is fascinating to watch. We get to see them play characters that feel real and down-to-earth. They have excellent chemistry and mesh a unique friendship throughout the movie. <br/><br/>The use of hand-held camera work adds authenticity to the film, giving that documentary feel. Unfortunately, this leads to some badly lit night scenes that go on longer than necessary. Overall, Arrenofsky has made a very good movie with wisely chosen actors. I'm not sure if Rourke will ever play a character to the caliber he has done with ""The Wrestler"" again, but he has proved that he can carry a film with stark believability."

","A faded professional wrestler (Mickey Rourke) must retire, but finds his quest for a new life outside the ring a dispiriting struggle.<br/><br/>Alonso Duralde, of MSNBC, said, ""Rourke's work transcends mere stunt-casting; his performance is a howl of pain that seems to come from a very real place."" Todd McCarthy, of Variety, said, ""Rourke creates a galvanizing, humorous, deeply moving portrait that instantly takes its place among the great, iconic screen performances."" <br/><br/>And that about sums it up. While Darren Aronofsky deserves much credit (he has yet to make a bad movie), this was Rourke's film from beginning to end. If the rumors are true that the studio wanted Nicolas Cage to play the lead, I am really glad that never happened. I love Cage, he has a lot of good acting in him when he chooses to use it... but Rourke owned this role."

","(Contains a HUGE spoiler!!!) In brief: Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson is a wrestler with his glory days behind him, and he is too old to continue. Outside of the ring, he spends his time at strip clubs, drinking and playing on an old Nintendo. He doesn't cope well with working at a supermarket, and clumsily tries to mend an broken relationship with his daughter. It all leads up to him getting one last chance in the ring, but can he take it? <br/><br/>If you love the kind of movies where the main character struggles with life, decides to change it and ends up living happily ever after as a result of some magical journey, do NOT watch this movie. Some people would say it ends well in a way, but the whole mood of the film signals that Randy's life has come to the point where things are going in a downward spiral. It is his complete dependence on the wrestling environment, his social clumsiness and his self-destructive ways in life that hinders him from turning the situation around, and yet still, Rourke delivers a performance that just makes it impossible for the viewer not to pity Randy as he eventually faces the grim truth: he won't be able to copy with living a normal life. The last scene implies that his heart starts to fail during a wrestling match, and he decides that instead of saving his life and quiting the match, he will go out with a bang. Great movies that appeal to people in this kind of way are way too rare these days."

","I've been a wrestling fan since the 1980's, so this movie came out. I was happy to see main stream America getting into it. Main Stream America still couldn't believe that these guys would, for example, mutilate themselves by 'blading' to have blood in matches or take dangerous 'bumps' stunts just to illusion violence in the ring. All these acts takes a ton on the body over the years, and 'the Wrestler' is a story of life imitates art. Mickey Rourke's character of Randy 'The Ram' Robinson mirrors the actor's life in many ways. Both were former stars who pushed their bodies to the limits in brutal fighting. Mickey Rourke quit acting for a while to try his hand in boxing. Randy 'The Ram' Robinson tries to quit wrestling, to try his luck with life. He befriends an aging stripper Cassidy (Marisa Tomei) and try to get back with his estranged adult daughter Stephanie (Evan Rachel Woods), but the proposing chance of a comeback 20th anniversary rematch against his most notable opponent, ""The Ayatollah"" (Ernest Miller) is calling him back to the ring. Soon, Randy must choice the life of the ring or life outside of it. Randy the Ram, seems to be based on a combination of former wrestlers. Wrestlers Bret Hart and Chris Jericho's books both described the appeal of hanging out with strippers because of the similar lifestyle. Both careers are fantasy based as men are used to portray violence and strippers as sex for their clients. The movie also tackle the dark side of steroid abuse that has caused a laundry list of wrestler deaths in just the past 10 years as Randy use steroids. He use it to tries to fight against age and still look strong and young. Randy's visual look: A tanned bleached blond whom body went to hell might be wrestlers like Lex Luger or better yet Superstar Billy Graham. Lex Luger has both the ailing body and rock bottom financial situation. Randy's volatile relationship with his daughter were definite inspirations for screenwriter Robert Siegel by Jake 'The Snake' Robert's relationship with his daughter as shown in the documentary 'Beyond the Mat'. The speech by Randy to his fans borderlines Terry Funk's 1997 ""retirement"" in the documentary. Mickey takes the experiences of the wrestlers, along with his own and shapes a character that he was born to play. The part was originally written for Nicholas Cage, but I can't imagine anyone but Mickey Rourke playing this part. Wrestling legend Hulk Hogan claimed that the role was for him. Thank God, that was a lie. Mickey Rourke was always Darren Aronofsky's choice for the film. Mickey Rourke was brilliant in the role. I can believe that the character was lonely. We feel his pain, we relate to his shortcomings and we cheer him on to find love with Cassidy and rebuild the relationship with his daughter. 'The piece of meat' speech at the empty New Jersey boardwalk was just emotionally. The ending to this film is just as powerful. Not only did it save Mickey Rourke's career, but also as well the Director Darren Aronofsky after taking a body slam for his previous film 'The Fountain'. The music in the film was amazing to listen to. The Bruce Springsteen 'Wrestler' song is just boss. The movie and the song goes right to the heart. It's spot on beautiful. Now to the faults of the film. The film can be a bit of a downer and paint wrestling in a bad light. Randy's wrong doing is all his fault. You can't help asking yourself, is he that stupid? He can't help but self-destruct in a series of acts that would better his life. The editing is very choppy in parts, hand-held camera was bit shaky and some of the writing is almost unbearably clich√©. I like the fact, the story arch has three acts process. I also like that a number of real life pro-wrestlers were feature in the film, as a fan boy, I found it very interesting. Some critics might hate this movie cause they were kinda hoping for a type of Rocky movie set in the world of wrestling, but the movie gave up to question kind of ending that makes you wonder what happen. I don't mind the drama with dark realism. Check it out, you will definitely find this movie worth it."

","This film appears to be all the sad truth of what happens to a wrestler after their marketability has passed. Bret Hart said it best, once you're used up, Vince is done with you. And the all too often desire to keep going when you know you should stop (Jerry Lawler).These guys put themselves through hell to entertain us and I resent anyone saying it's fake. I dare any of you to do what they do for five minutes and not pass out or be sore. Sure the outcomes are predetermined and the matches are worked so their is minimal injury, but still there is an amazing amount of punishment these men and woman put their bodies through. This is what that movie deals with. Mickey Rourke, while I've never been a big fan, is awesome here. The movie really captures the feel of the life of a pro wrestler. I love the scene in the locker room where is chatting with his opponent for the night, going over what they will do in their match. That's how it happens people, guess what, Undetaker and HHH don't really hate one another. BUt all to often real injuries happen (in 97 when Owen Hart accidentally had Steve Austin down too low for a pile driver, he drove Austin's neck into the matt for real. That injury nags Stone Cold til this day. HIs strained relationship with his daughter is really great here. I mean I don't wanna spoil it for you, just see it.

","Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson (Rourke) is a renowned wrestler, a show stealer. But one night he is forced to retire and starts to look at his life in a different light.<br/><br/>Being a huge fan of the American wrestling entertainment such as WWE and TNA I looked forward to seeing how wrestling was portrayed in this film. But I was given so much more. This is a strong passionate drama that will make you laugh, cry and stand up and cheer. And there are two reasons why: Mickey Rourke and Darren Aronofsky.<br/><br/>Much was made of this film being Mickey Rourke's big come back after all he has been through over the years. This is a film that really shows his masculinity, his strength but combined with an underlining sentimentality and a deep internal struggle brings about an Oscar nominated performance.<br/><br/>The Ram is a hero. The wonderful opening credits show a montage of the wrestler at the top of his game, showcasing his talents and being the man in that era. As the film progresses we can see how the character changes through highs at independent events to the lows with his family life. Ram is an inspiration through strong will and a determination to make everything right for his family and for himself. The way he portrays himself to his neighbours, and the choices in language all collate into a fantastic person, that is always a joy to watch.<br/><br/>Aronofsky's writing chooses to follow Rourke's character from start to finish and his choices of including other interests such as strippers, family, wrestling, drug smuggling and food service jobs all mix to make a believable, almost relaxing story. Everything flows smoothly with the excitement of the wrestling matches to the heavy dramatic scenes between father and daughter to the tense love scenarios.<br/><br/>The film has a real independent feel. There is no glitz and glamour, everything is portrayed as run down and difficult living environments. Ram's home is shabby, his workplace is stressful but his real life lies in the ring. Aronofsky's close ups are great but his scenery shots are even better.<br/><br/>The wrestling matches are the highlights of this 2008 picture. Being a fan of wrestling I enjoyed seeing how the independent scene was worked, how each wrestler interacted with each other behind the curtains and seeing how brutal some of the 'weapons' used were. The brutality and execution from all the actors and the crowd worked wonders.<br/><br/>Given Ram's life and everything he has been put through it is inspiring to see a person give everything into something they enjoy doing and through Rourke's strong dynamic performance and the directional master class of Aronofsky, this is a great drama that is definitely worth checking out."

It is not exactly phenomenal or memorable in anyway, but it is not so simple to watch either. All i see throughout this movie is very...human, human as i hv never seen before within and outside the wrestling rings, human as if u are really witnessing a testimony of a wrestler, and feel that you might have ended up in the same situation yourself if life takes a different route...and that is itself a rare quality in good movies nowadays.

","The Wrestler is one of the best movies to come out in 2008 mainly because of the out-of-this-world performance by Mickey Rourke. This is easily his best role he has ever done. Because his character, Ram and the actor himself have so many things in common, this is the perfect movie for Mickey. I could feel his pain and his emotions as if I was the main character.<br/><br/>This film is about a lonely, washed up wrestler who tries to make amends with his daughter, fall in love with a stripper, and still do his job in the ring.<br/><br/>Mickey Rourke did a performance of the lifetime, but so did Marisa Tomei. As the stripper, she added goodness and her character was likable. Evan Rachel Wood also did a very good job as the daughter of Ram.<br/><br/>Overall, this is one heck of a drama with fantastic direction by Darren Aronofsky. I also loved the end credits song by Bruce Springsteen. I rate this film 9/10."
"toll-8","8","0","0","19 October 2012"," Rourke and Aronofsky make this a moving, powerful film
","In 2008 Darren Aronofsky helmed the movie that would bring Mickey Rourke's career back to potential stardom. The Wrestler is a film about a former legend refusing to accept when his time is up and would rather be respected for something he can't do than be forgotten for something he can. It is a powerful, moving story that simply uses wrestling as a way to highlight the obstacles that approach a man who has lived life from the inside out.<br/><br/>We open watching Randy 'The Ram' (Rourke) preparing for his next match up. In the title sequence we see that he was once a top wrestler, one of those ones we all gawp at on the television, now twenty years later he is performing in front of a few hundred in a sports arena as opposed to the millions in front of a TV camera. We witness him and his opponent going through the motions of their fight back stage and then we see the real thing. It may be fake, but boy it is still brutal. The wrestlers cut themselves with razors in order to gain affect and literally talk to each other so they know the next move. Even the poor referee gets in on the action. This is Randy's world. This is where he is appreciated. We later see him meet the woman he desires in Cassidy (Tomei), a stripper at his local bar, who he sees as a sounding board for all of his wrestling experiences. He used to have it good and he wishes to one day get back there, but his crippled body now sees him struggling to pay rent and having to take on a part time job at a grocery store. His next fight pits him against the 'crazy one' who uses staple guns to hurt his opponent. This is a bloody fight and although premeditated they really are hurting each other. So much so that once the fight is over Randy suffers a heart attack. After being told he can never wrestle again Randy cancels his big comeback fight and settles for attempting to woo the affections of Cassidy and renew the friendship between him and his estranged daughter, but he soon realises that without the ring, without the cheering, without the bloodshed he can't cope with life and the temptation of one day fighting again is just far too much.<br/><br/>The first thing that deserves a mention is the personnel involved. Mickey Rourke is fantastic as 'The Ram'. He isn't playing this character, he is this character. It was rumoured that Nicolas Cage was first in line for the role and I am so glad Rourke got it as he is the only one you can really see playing it. The long bleach blonde hair, the fake tan, the steroid induced body all work when it comes to Rourke's style and look. He is Randy 'The Ram'. When he isn't kicking lumps out of fellow wrestlers, Rourke pulls us into his trouble personality with an emotional turn at the midpoint. His world is on the up and he is enjoying his new found life, but when it all turns bad Rourke's performance makes us feel his pain. Emotion is his pain not the ass kicking in the ring. Tomei is also brilliant and very daring in a role that has her wearing nothing but a tiny g-string. She is 'The Ram's' sounding board although they are very similar, she is the female version of him in a different world but manages to handle it a whole lot better. Evan Rachel Wood is also affective as his daughter but doesn't have as much screen time as the others. <br/><br/>Aronofsky's direction is also top notch. This man has always delivered fantastic films (Requiem For A Dream being one of my favourites) and he delivers yet another one here. His decision to not show us Randy from the front until at least ten minutes is a great one. At first we see a fighter but when we finally see him for what he is a lonely old man. The choice to give us many following tracking shots also works. Many of them are following Randy as he walks through corridors, through the shop, through the woods, basically through life, and it makes us experience his world. The best piece is when we hear the crowd as Randy prepares for his first day on the Deli Counter at the grocery store, only for the crowd cheers to disappear when he enters the deli instead of the ring. It's such a meaningful shot.<br/><br/>The story feels like that of a prisoner who struggles to live outside of a jail cell. This is the sort of man Randy is but his prison is the ring. He doesn't know how to be or how to act when it isn't in spandex. This set up and story arc leads us to a powerful ending that really shows how a man can struggle through life when he has tasted something he loves. It is emotional, it is powerful, it will make you understand the world of a onetime hero, Rourke and Aronofsky are to thank for that. Don't be put off by the fact it is wrestling, there is a much deeper story and his profession is simply the rope he leaps off to find himself in a troubled world. This is a must see.<br/><br/>4 / 5<br/><br/>For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com"

","Dramatic, Depressing And Heart-Breaking at times, The Wrestler is a very good movie which is majorly boosted by the brilliant performance by the returning Mickey Rourke as Randy ''The Ram'' Robinson and the Brilliant direction of Darren Aronofsky in making the movie this good which is backed up with a unique and life-like story of a rather complicated character.<br/><br/>So This Original Story which is written by Robert D. Siegel is about an aged professional wrestler Randy Robinson(Rourke) who gets a heart attack after a wrestling match one day,he finds out cannot wrestle ever again due to a poor heart condition and will die if he decides to wrestle and must retire from it, but he finds it increasingly difficult to stay out it and live a rather normal life which is filled with complications such as earning his living and making a healthy relationship with his love interest Cassidy(Tomei) and his daughter Stephenie(Wood), and is caught in a dilemma on what to do next.<br/><br/>This Movie revolves around Mickey Rourke as the main character who is the vocal point of the movie and who did a remarkable job considering that this was his return to mainstream cinema's after a short spell away he makes the role his own as he becomes like an aged wrestler in the end of his career and also does a perfect job in acting as a rather lonely Randy ''The Ram'' Robinson, and Rourke is one of the few main reasons on why this movie is so worth watching. Marissa Tomei does a very good in portraying Cassidy who is a stripper and also Randy's love interest, along with Evan Rachel Wood as Stephenie who's the daughter of Randy, and although Rourke steals the show in the movie, the other actors have done a good job in their roles.<br/><br/>In My Opinion, This movie is this good because of two reasons which are The Acting of Rourke and The Direction of Darren Aronofsky who does a tremendous job with the staff he got and considering that some of them are'nt even actors and there are so many inexperienced actors in the movie, he made every one of them act brilliantly. He also utilized this story and chose the right man in Rourke to play it, and showed the story perfectly to the audience thus making e a different type of a movie and he again excels in making really brilliant movies of different genre's. <br/><br/>The Story which is original is about a different type of a movie which also show's some action in the wrestling sequences, but is way different in most of it as a rather tensed drama about a rather lonely wrestler who's life is only about wrestling, and this story is very unique in its own way and kudos to the story writer Robert Siegel and also Kudos to the Director and Rourke for showing it so brilliantly to the audience.<br/><br/>The Music in this movie is given quite well and the music synchronized well with the scene's, many of which were quite dramatic, while many were tensed and depressing at times. Music Director Clint Mansell has done a good job with the back-ground music of this movie and the ending music was good too. The Set Design of the wrestling arena was also decently made up by the Set Designers.<br/><br/>This Movie is definitely one to watch for movie fans and the brilliant acting by Rourke is the shining light of this brilliant movie backed up by the effort put into it by the staff of the movie.<br/><br/>My Rating: 7.5/10"

","As a character study, ""The Wrestler"" is a gut wrenching film. Mickey Rourke portrays a pro grappler well past his prime, living vicariously through his past accomplishments as a Madison Square Garden headliner, now just happy enough to accept matches at small town venues in high school gyms and VFW halls. I couldn't help but think back to a particular night in the late Seventies when I attended a card held at an airport hangar on an active military base. Following the matches, one could look through the windows of the dressing room from outside and watch the paymaster handing out cash to the wrestlers for the evening's work. Wrestling fans will recognize some of the names. Arnold Skaaland was the promoter, and the card that night include Ted DiBiase, Pat Patterson, Johnny Valiant (who's in this movie), and The Iron Sheik. It looked like Skaaland counted out three twenty dollar bills to The Sheik, not a very hefty pay day for 1979.<br/><br/>Speaking of The Iron Sheik, he would have been the inspiration for this picture's Ayatollah, the Iranian flag waving villain with bald head and mustache just like the original. Mickey Rourke's character looked like a crusty version of Macho Man Randy Ravage (hence the name Randy the Ram), his persona based on any of a number of flamboyant mat stars of the era depicted. The wrestling itself blended a bit of old time Sixties semi-realism with today's hard core and extreme elements that just like the movies, tries to out-do itself with new gimmicks at every turn. I stopped following it when it got so over the top that it became a caricature of itself; for me the entertainment value had been drained right out of it.<br/><br/>What makes the picture is Mickey Rourke's performance. This is one of the few characterizations you'll ever see where the actor is completely submerged into the role he's playing. Rourke is tender, touching, wild, insane, drug addled and hopeless, but you always feel for him because he's the genuine article in the picture. No doubt, much of that comes from his own personal struggles and he conveys it in a convincing manner.<br/><br/>When I first saw this picture during it's original release, I couldn't believe that was really Marisa Tomei doing her own nude scenes. I'm still not quite sure I believe it, but let's face it, it's pretty difficult to hide the fact that it's her out there in the all together. Once you compose yourself, you'll also recognize the exceptional performance she provides here in support of The Ram, well deserving of the Supporting Actress nomination that year.<br/><br/>For something a little closer to the mark, I would also recommend a 1999 documentary film called ""Beyond the Mat"" that follows the exploits of pro wrestlers like Mick Foley, Terry Funk and Darren 'Droz' Drozdov. While watching ""The Wrestler"", the movie and Rourke's character both reminded me a lot of Jake the Snake Roberts from BYM, in that he also dealt with severe addictions and a troubled home life, and if I'm not mistaken, a rather dysfunctional relationship with his own adult daughter."

","but this film was beautiful. Harsh, gritty, awkward in parts but ultimately a triumph of direction and sensitivity. 'The Wrestler' it may be called, and a gritty depiction of lower league wrestling it may give but in the end this story isn't about wrestling at all. It's about a man dealing with his life as the one he loved has passed him by. It deals with his loneliness, his frustrations and his ineptitude at forming normal relationships outside of the ring and life he loved.<br/><br/>There is no happiness in this film, so be warned! A few heart warming moments but ultimately this film is about a personal tragedy. As I said at the top, its beautifully handled with sensitivity and skill by the director of which I really shouldn't be surprised as Aronofsky is also responsible for that other masterpiece of personal tragedy 'requiem for a dream'. In this film he has gained a fan and I look forward to his next works."

Neither Backlund or the Masked Superstar looked in the kind of bad physical shape that Mickey Rourke as Randy 'the Ram' Robinson who is about 20 years past his prime.<br/><br/>But like Mountain Rivera in Requiem For A Heavyweight, what else does this man know? What else is he trained to do. Maybe he could have been an athletic director at some high school with a bit of education and be living good with some respect. But he stayed too long and a big part of it is that he can't be without the roar of the crowd even if it's some American Legion Hall Charity event.<br/><br/>With serious health issues Rourke decides to grab for glory once more with a battle just like Bob Backlund had with the Masked Superstar by going against his former rival nemesis the Ayatollah from the eighties albeit in a smaller venue just like what I was at.<br/><br/>Rourke really immerses himself in the character of Randy Robinson you do forget that this is acting, you think you're backstage with all the wrestlers whose bodies take quite a pounding for an exhibit. Rourke's has taken about all it will.<br/><br/>Two female roles are of prominence Marisa Tomei who got a Best Supporting Actress nomination as an aging stripper who has been a bit smarter than Rourke about accepting old age. And Evan Rachel Ward playing Rourke's daughter from a long ago marriage who is totally estranged from him.<br/><br/>But Tomei was lucky to be noticed because The Wrestler is Mickey Rourke's show completely. This is definitely Mickey Rourke's signature role and sad he came up for an Oscar the year Sean Penn also became Harvey Milk in the same way that Rourke became the Ram."

","Upon watching the Wrestler the first thing that comes to mind is how true to life it seems. We get a first hand look at the aspect of a profession that it is very easy to act like never happens.

The shooting style was just right for the story. I will say that the director used the exact same ""feel"" for Black Swan with didn't work quite as well as it did in the Wrestler.<br/><br/>I'm not a professional wrestling fan, but i do think its something anyone that watches WWE should check out so that you can see what these guys life is actually like.<br/><br/>Very good movie."

","Not a bad character study, but lacks distinction. I thought the theme of people past their prime in their chosen professions (the equally ridiculous worlds of wrestling and stripping) was interesting, especially with the meta-ness of Rourke and Tomei being former stars beyond their glory years, but not developed fully enough. The film hinges on Rourke's performance, which to his credit is excellent. A genuine and relatable portrayal of a character that I probably wouldn't care for in other hands. However, my interest started to wane as the movie wore on, just not quite enough meat on these bones, and nothing too surprising develops. Still, an engaging film with a few nice touches."

","The Wrestler features the best performance since Charlize Theron played serial killer Aileen Wuornos. To say the performance is the movie is both a praise and a pretty comprehensive summary of the plot which largely follows Rourke's Randy ""The Ram√¢¬Ä? Robinson as he navigates the tawdry remains of his superstar wrestling career which peaks some 20 years past. There is a subplot with his estranged daughter which is brief and leads nowhere as does largely his wooing of Pam/Cassidy a single mother and stripper whom The Ram frequents. This single story arc through is interesting although ultimately Randy progresses little emotionally. The ending of the movie is a Bruce Springsteen song, fitting given the the gritty Industrial North Jersey setting and story of washed-up fame."

","An Aronofsky character drama in the most primal form. <br/><br/>Combining the raw ambition and power of Mickey Rouke with the tender Evan Rachel Wood and the self-aware Marisa Tomei, Darren Aronofsky brought the simple story of a struggling man to the screen with a sickening grace. During many of the almost faux-documentary moments it's difficult not to cringe at the sheer force of the touchingly harrowing film. Following a Wrestler at the bottom of his game, there is hardly room for feel-good, but Aronofsky manages to create the moments of hope that make the devastation that much more unforgettable. <br/><br/>A masterpiece of character drama and an unbelievably astonishing work of direction.

","Randy ""The Ram"" is an aging wrestler, a respected, almost venerated veteran of the ring on weekends, but a grocery clerk living a lonely existence in his trailer park home the rest of the time. The physical and pharmaceutical abuse over the years catches up with him, and he is forced into a re-evaluation of his life.<br/><br/>Mickey Rourke's comeback is now the stuff of legend, and he is so convincing as The Ram here that it is difficult to remember the incredulity, the sneering, that initially greeted the idea of Rourke carrying a film made in 2008. ""Comeback"" is also slightly misleading, because the Rourke who charmed us in Diner and seduced us in 9¬Ω Weeks is a completely different animal from the pumped up, haggard, speech slurring wreck of a man The Ram has become.<br/><br/>This is nothing less than an acting masterclass. You feel every grunt and gasp as The Ram stretches a muscle, bathes a cut, or has a staple pulled from his skin. Aronofsky said in an interview that Rourke is an actor who remembers his lines after you shoot the scene - that is surely a joke, as Rourke exceeds the physicality of his role to give moving speeches, most notably when telling his estranged daughter how sorry he is (before messing up royally again), and in his showcase bout with a former nemesis, when he shows he has true love in his life - with his audience.<br/><br/>This is a small film with a big heart, the quiet tale of one man's obsession with his job and failure to match that dedication in his personal relationships. Rourke gets strong support from Marisa Tomei as Cassidy, or possibly Pam, a stripper with her own relationship issues, who struggles to resist her feelings for Randy. Evan Rachel Wood as Randy's daughter Stephanie convinces, as do the other players in small roles, most notably a vicious, small-minded store boss who is as much a sociopath as any David Brent, and will rings bells for suffering employees in workplaces around the globe.<br/><br/>The locations ooze grit, the hand-held camera keeps it all tight and intimate, and the script is spare and colloquial. The true genius was having the vision to see that Rourke would pull off this role. A satisfying movie with a startling 'making of' backstory."

","""Witness the resurrection of Mickey Rourke in Darren Aronofsky's deeply affecting film"" reads a huge marketing poster of the Golden Lion winner at Venice. I would say exactly the same. And if you think The Dark Knight was snubbed at the Oscars, this was daylight robbery. The Academy owes Aronofsky a Best Picture and Director nomination here. The Wrestler stars Rourke in a comeback performance as Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson. It chronicles the ups-and-downs of the life of the Ram Jam wrestler twenty years after he first ruled the wrestling ring. He meets a stripper, Cassidy (played by Marisa Tomei), whom he forms a friendly bond with. And when things seem to look bright for Randy, he suffers a heart attack and is forced to retire from wrestling. <br/><br/>For someone whose life is devoted to a passion and in which he now is unable to pursue, the sudden emptiness can be shocking and it can beget an emotional breakdown even for a grown, rugged man. Aronofsky makes this the cornerstone of his film rather than assembling a picture with an unnecessary series of lengthy wrestling fights. He wants to tell the story of Randy the Common Man. For a fighter like he is, Randy is subjected to emotional hurt and suffering as well. While he takes it well under the circumstances, Rourke portrays him as somewhat fragile and vulnerable. In the ring, he is a hero. Outside it, he is zero. Rourke is nominated here, and he very well deserves that Oscar as much as Sean Penn does for his portrayal as the gay politician Harvey Milk in Milk (2008). <br/><br/>Wrestling is a fake sport made real by the documentary-styled filmmaking. Aronofsky opts for the 'fly on the wall' approach to scenes of Rourke in the trailer or restroom prior to a match, giving a sense of immediacy to what is going to happen. The Wrestler is an eye-opening film too because it allows viewers an intimate glimpse to how wrestlers work with one another and how they employ 'cheating' tactics to entertain their audience. Yet no matter how rehearsed the fight sequences are in real life or in this film, they are still physically punishing. When these wrestlers tumble down hard, we can feel their pain. And the violence and gore can be unsettling to viewers as well. <br/><br/>The final few minutes of The Wrestler are probably the most heart- wrenching moments in all of 2008's films. Because Rourke has so successfully delivered a complex screen protagonist, viewers not only sympathize for his character, but also understand why he makes the decision to continue wrestling despite his age and ailing health. The Wrestler is hardcore, gritty and vulgar, a reminiscent of Arononsky's drug masterpiece, Requiem For A Dream (2000). Yet at its heart, it remains an enlightening and humanizing cinematic experience. A must- watch! <br/><br/>GRADE: A (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved."

","I saw this film only a few days after seeing Daniel Aronofsky's acclaimed ballet movie, ""Black Swan"", which may well propel the hard working Natalie Portman to a well-deserved Oscar. I thought it was a brilliant but rather cold and nasty piece of work. In this earlier film, notable for the resurrection of the wayward Mickey Rourke's career, the approach is much more sympathetic. In both films Aronofsky gets the audience inside the main character's mind ‚Äì in fact we hardly go outside it. Mickey's Randy the clapped out wrestler is a familiar figure. and not difficult to understand. Pro wrestling as practiced in the US is entertainment rather than sport, but Randy's body can no longer put up with the physical abuse involved. Randy knows this, yet he cannot embrace retirement, or at least life in alternative employment, in his case behind a supermarket delicatessen counter. He also has personal issues, an estranged daughter and his relationship with a pole-dancer, the latter played by the always interesting Marisa Tomei.<br/><br/>Mickey puts in a faultless performance. His Randy exudes bravado but his aggression is well under control. In his quieter moments he shows gentleness and sensitivity. Unfortunately his propensity for hell-raising interferes with his personal relationships, though his ring performance is less affected. We know things are not going to end well but they do end neatly.<br/><br/>The world of pro wrestling is not seen in a glamorous light and the film is unlikely to boost trade. While we get a very clear picture of what might drive a competitor like Randy in this business, I was at the end of the day no clearer about what motivates the audience. Is this some survivor of a more atavistic age where people derive pleasure from seeing others bashing each other up? Boxing, in comparison, is much more structured and physically skilled. In pro wrestling we seem to be satisfying some pretty primitive desires. Randy the Ram knows what his audience wants and will just about kill himself to give it to them, but the audience won't really care if he dies on the job.<br/><br/>""Black Swan"" packed a bigger emotional punch than ""The Wrestler"". Yet I felt for the wrestler but not for the ballerina. Aronofsky is one of those directors who can coax a stunning performance out of apparently ordinary actors, and there must be a long queue outside his casting agency."

","Normally I despise stuff like professional wrestling and hate anything to do with New Jersey. But this movie and script is so powerful it made me respect both. Pro wrestling is a nothing more than crude slapstick pretending to be a sport. But the wrestlers have to have some athletic ability and physique, but they are more like stunt men than trapeze artists. They take a beating in those stunts as well as many have hurt themselves abusing steroids and other drugs they used to bulk up, as well as sundry recreational drug use. Also, while the cream of the WWF are quite well off, the bottom rung of the ""sport"" is like Babe Ruth Baseball, they earn a couple hundred for a match in a VFW Hall on Friday then back to some miserable grind of a job next Monday.<br/><br/>Mickey Rourke was a natural for this role. His life paralleled the Randy the Ram. The Ram is an over the hill pro wrestler who is one step away from homelessness. He lives in a trailer park, works during the week in a supermarket and does bush league local ""fights"" in small venues like Legion Halls or church gyms. He has a heart attack after one gig and is warned not to continue in his trade less he may die the next time. But the time in the ring and the camaraderie with the other ""fighters"" (actors) is the only thing that makes his life worth living. His social life is based on courting a stripper, Cassidy played by Marisa Tomei but he does seem to be a favorite uncle type to the kids in his trailer park.<br/><br/>Facing his mortality, the Ram tries to mend bridges with his estranged daughter Stephanie, played by Evan Rachel Wood, fails. Even though he and the stripper seem to be soul mates, she has to spurn him out of professional etiquette of not messing with customers. They both have similar trades, providing an exaggerated act based on their masculinity/femininity to crowds of low brow gawkers, where some of them don't see it as an act and them as actors.<br/><br/>What is beautiful about it is the three principles carry it off so well. It's an overworked charade to say that a movie is so ""real"", especially in these days of ""reality"" TV, but it felt that way in everything from the sets, costumes, the use of real wrestling matches and other location shots. Even the pay phones the Ram uses, since he can't even afford cell service, are located on a real deserted, abandoned railway passenger platform by an abandoned railroad tunnel and line. I had no trouble identifying and liking the characters even though they chose a life that was essentially a charade. They tried for the dream their way and failed. It was a beautiful elegy to a decent common man, no hero, without one shred of hype or Hollywood glitz."

","The Wrestler tells the story of a man who is past his prime and facing the consequences of his past decisions. He is alone, friendless, and without much to look forward to. He strives for redemption, attempting reconciliation with his estranged daughter and building a meaningful relationship with an ageing stripper. When he fails at both, he returns to the only place where he is accepted, which will ultimately destroy him.<br/><br/>Yes, this review contains spoilers, but I don't think it spoils anything. The narrative arc in the movie is certainly worthy of reflection. It applies to much outside the world of wrestling. We can contrast the Ram's situation with Pam's; she too is facing the twilight of her livelihood, but she has a plan and is working at it. We can contemplate the self-destructive nature of people. And yet, even if you read the script front to back, it's still well worth watching this movie, which succeeds all the more on the strength of the acting. Much has been said about Mickey Rourke's performance, and rightfully so, but I thought all three leads gave convincing performances.<br/><br/>David Simon has stated that the main character of the Wire is the city of Baltimore. I would be remiss not to mention the other lead character in this movie, the industry of professional wrestling. Many people have written that you don't even need to like wrestling to enjoy this movie. They are right. And some have said that you could substitute the experiences of the Ram for those of someone in another line of work and it would be equivalent. They are partially right. But for me, part of what makes this movie hard to watch, but impossible to turn away from, is the portrayal of an industry filled with examples of people dying well before their time, very often of heart attacks or overdoses relating to drug and alcohol abuse, the inevitable toll of years of physical sacrifice and inadequate support. One of the most poignant scenes in the movie involves the Ram at a fan meet-and-greet in a legion hall. He looks around and sees how the other old wrestlers present have canes and other reminders of their infirmity. And they are the ""lucky"" ones who made it. And this is what they are reduced to, signing autographs and selling merchandise for a few bucks to whoever will still come by, out of loyalty or curiosity.<br/><br/>This is a haunting movie. It's not just because of Rourke, who is amazing. Rourke makes it better than it would have been, but the story is the platform that makes such a performance possible. This one's going to stay with me for a while."

","An excellent film with outstanding performances from Mickey Rourke and Marisa Tomei and Evan Rachel Wood.<br/><br/>In essence, this film is a reflection of working life as it really is for the masses - i.e. work for low pay until you die and/or until you are too old to enjoy life, and while doing so neglect the important things in life like developing and maintaining relationships with family and friends.<br/><br/>It all sounds a bit corny but the story of Randy ""the Ram"" Robinson is not that different from many people in jobs they hate but have to do either for money or because they can't let go of the only thing they really know and feel part of. It sounds quite sad and The Wrestler is indeed a fairly sad film.<br/><br/>Though sadness for Rourke's Randy might be forthcoming, the real sadness is for the two women in his life - Marisa Tomei - the would be girlfriend who works as a stripper/dancer but is a single mother trying to balance her double life - professionally a sexy dancer and privately a mother just trying to escape the sleaze of her profession. She sees Randy as a man she could maybe feel for and in the end she does care for him unlike his daughter Evan Rachel Wood who has been let down once too many times to care any more for her father.<br/><br/>Where The Wrestler really works is in the intimate direction and pacey storyline. There is no flab in this movie except around the waistlines of some of the musclebound mountain men wrestlers. It's very well done with steady cam shots and sure editing. The story and characters quickly hook us and though the wrestling scenes are a bit too graphically gory, it's a journey we have to go through to fully understand the man and his motives.<br/><br/>Though the film plays on pathos and is quite brutal (and not just the wrestling scenes)The Wrestler does have some very funny moments and a good tight script. It's a very watchable movie and in some ways enjoyable. The underpinning theme of loneliness is woven around each of the three key characters and in the end you'll probably want to be better to those around you and maybe contact those you've neglected for a while.<br/><br/>I don't often like sporting movies but The Wrestler is one that has to be one of the best sporting movies ever made as it gives a real insight into the sport/entertainment industry. It's certainly worth watching for Rourke's outstanding performance."

Funnily enough, I watched Crazy Heart the night before and the two films felt very much of the same sentiment.<br/><br/>Sean Penn won the Oscar for Best Actor for his portrayal of Harvey Milk in Milk which was a great performance but I think the Academy must have debated long and hard who give it to. I think they made the wrong choice because although both Penn and Mickey Rourke actors carry their respective movies Penn's portrayal was more of an impersonation; Rourke's is a possession.<br/><br/>The story follows the fictional comeback years of a once great Wrestler (The Ram) who still has a loyal following and top billing, but in provincial events where the new generation are creating ever more bizarre wrestling characters with weirder and weirder means of entertaining their audiences. A life time of substance abuse has rendered The Ram susceptible to too much exertion and it is when he faces the ""Necro Butcher"" and his unorthodox method of staple gunning (with permission of course) his opponents that it all gets too much for Rourke and he suffers a heart attack that needs a bypass to save his life.<br/><br/>The operation brings him briefly to his senses and so we enter act 2 in which he tries to rekindle love in his life for his 21 year old daughter (nicely played by Evan Rachel Wood) and his ""tart with a heart"" lap dancing on-off flame.<br/><br/>Marisa Tomie, who plays the part, is awesome and certainly deserved her Oscar nomination; sadly she too failed to convert. But it's all too much for both The Ram and his Beaus. The lure of the ring finally gets him back with a hair raising finale in which he takes on his old enemy ""The Ayatollah"" in a stage managed fiasco that simply breaks the heart.<br/><br/>This is a stunning character piece played by an actor who has made more comebacks than the character he lays. But Rourke is godlike. It is intensely reminiscent of e Niro's performance in Raging Bull not just because of the subject matter but for the commitment that both men put into their job. At 56 this was surely an even greater feat by Rourke than the then still young Di Niro. But the film is more than a testosterone laden gross out. It's a heartfelt and beautiful study of failure i life, in love and in everything except integrity."

","A film where the very concept of self destruction itself reaches its own form of perfection, for both its lead character Randy (Rourke) and the path he follows tirelessly. Director Darren Aronofsky revives Mickey's career with a story beyond the bruises and challenges of the wrestling ring, focusing on a character that was once on top, and is now in the lowest possible point of his life, while trying to fit into society, making rent, and even taking whatever chance he gets to be on top. Mickey Rourke gives his greatest performance yet playing a character that in a manner of speaking represents his own persona. Randy the Ram Robinson, or Ram Jam to many fans, was big hit in the 80's, wowing wrestling fans all across America, only to fall after 2 decades of really pushing it to the extreme. Now he is alone, poor, struggling to make his rent, wrestling for small time firms, and working a deli counter under the supervision of a prickly manager (Barry). The only form of social warmth he gets is from his old wrestling buds, and compassionate, but undesirable table dancer named Pam, or most often going with her stage name Cassidy (Tomei). Randy doesn't have any complaints, yet he suffering hard and slow, and not just by the many drugs he mixes into his regiment, but furthermore the sight of his own life slipping away from him. After nearly suffering a heart attack, like any rational guy, it gets him thinking about life and how he should be living it, when clearly he has hasn't been living it to the best. In that path to a better life, Randy quits wrestling, and tries to slowly rebuild his life by fixing a relationship with the only true family he has, His daughter Stephanie (Wood) shows no desire to rekindle with Daddy, after feeling the cold resentment of abandonment, and thinking their chances of a good father daughter relationship are finished. It's only with a twist if faith that Ram is able to get close enough to have a chance. All it took was a little bit of long quiet pier walk, a dance, and innocent dinner date. Randy's hopes go to Hell when he tries his moves on Pam, thinking their friendship is beyond being friends, only to be rejected ,and once again alone.The quick snort of some blow and a little late night strange screw up his chances of fixing things, when all he had going for him was a chance of a better life. Stephanies hopes go down the drain too, when Ram misses their dinner date, ending the relationship for good. Believe her, when she said done, she meant, nothing, no chance of their relationship going anywhere. When it came to being a Wrestler Randy is the king, it's his thing, and when it came to trying to be normal, he was in the words of his own daughter, a living breathing F-up. I don't blame her, and neither did Randy, as he returned back to the very place he lives and breathes best, the ring. When taking a chance at being back on top, Randy faces an old wrestler, The Ayahtollah. In the match Pam tries what she can to stop Randy, only for Ram to settle the fact that it's who he is. The ring is his home, and the audience is his family, the very people who really tell him when he's done. Randy's fate, whether it would be alive or dead, at the very conclusion of his signature move, the film comes to a close as he leap onto his destiny. ""The Wrestler can only be seen as a perfect movie, when combining the drama of Aronofsky's character Randy, the very solid and sometimes moving performances of the 3 leads, Rourke, Tomei, and Wood. The movie itself goes beyond redemption and change, but simple acceptance of one character. Randy tried and failed miserably, to fit in society, only to later realize just how better off he is in the world of wrestling, like so many other of the steroid loving lug heads like Necro Butcher, Rob Eckos, and Nick Berk (as shown in the film). ""The Wrestler"" is a triumph of Aronofsky's talent to turn a brutal and somewhat fake, show motivated sport like wrestling into a matter of one man's sense of entitlement."

","If you are familiar with Darren Aranofsky's previous work, the visual style of ""The Wrestler"" is rather disarming; I was surprised to find the film was shot hand-held, with only occasional scenes in which the camera remains completely stationary. This gives the whole film an energy, which you might expect with the inevitable action scenes, but is really quite fresh when it comes to what happens outside of the ring.<br/><br/>Given how much craft we're used to seeing on the screen when it comes to this director, you would never guess this is by the man responsible for ""The Fountain"". Here, we get a lot of scenes where it does not feel like much has been planned so far as camera angles or technical craft is concerned. Takes have been left untouched in the editing process, and the camera is often simply following Rourke's character, ""The Ram"", opening up the room the characters are in, and letting the performances be the star. With all this taken into account, it is fair to say that ""The Wrestler"" displays the least directing talent from Aranofsky, but only in that you really feel he has put his 'director ego' aside, and has trusted the film to work this way.<br/><br/>The draw of the film is the human-ness of it, the emotion, the simple story of a wrestler who was once at the top of his game, has long since fallen, and who is now trying to reconcile his wrecked relationship with his daughter, and find some sort of happiness outside of the ring. To have messed around with artifice would have somehow detracted from the soul of the film, which is the events on screen and quite simply, the acting.<br/><br/>That said, there is some subtle musical scoring from Clint Mansell, which is sparse, but it is really great when it delivers. The actors had not met before filming some of their scenes, so there was a real sense with the heaviest moments in the film that there had been no rehearsal; they are raw, improvised to some degree, and allowed to be as natural as they can be. Evan Rachel Wood, who I developed quite an admiration for when I saw ""Thirteen"", gives it all, and whether you agree with her choices and actions, or not, it doesn't take away from her believability one bit. Isabella Rossellini is unrecognisable as Joe Pesci's girlfriend in ""My Cousin Vinny""; she is subtle and natural as the stripper with whom ""The Ram"" wants to develop some relationship beyond that of a customer.<br/><br/>""Witness the resurrection of Mickey Rourke"", they said. Much was made of the physical performance, but I would suggest this wasn't the stretch many imagined; Rourke was a boxer and is not unfamiliar with the gym environment. The real strength of his acting here is in playing the man. This film reminds you that before he threw it all away, he was a great screen actor and there is no doubt that this, strangely, is the role his life has dictate that he play. It could only be Rourke for the role of ""The Ram"". When he first received the script, he was disappointed, because as a boxer he had always looked down on wrestling, but he asked Aronofsky to allow him to make it personal, to change the character's lines to reflect his own experiences: his dialogue in the film are things he has said, the situations are ones he has been in, and you can really sense that in a genuine and heart rending performance. When ""The Ram"" makes his speech (you know it when you see the film), it is not ""The Ram"", it is Mickey Rourke. I am very glad to see him given the opportunity to make a comeback, and I look forward to seeing him move forward and make the most of what most professionals don't get, a second chance! It is quite right to say you DO NOT have to be particularly keen on wrestling to enjoy the film, as it is far more about the story of the man than his work in the ring, much like ""Raging Bull"" not being about boxing, or ""Remember The Titans"" not being an American football film. It should still be stressed, however, that due to the nature of the filmmaking and some of the content, this may not appeal to everyone, but if you want to see Rourke giving an unexpectedly wonderful performance, or you're an Aranofsky fan, it's definitely a must! Very oddly, I would say don't expect to enjoy it simply on the basis you're a wrestling fan, as that is not necessarily going to be the case.<br/><br/>I admire the film for venturing into the murky waters of drug and steroid use, that it didn't shy away from the grittier side of the lifestyle these athletes choose, and I raise my hat to Aronofsky for how he chose to close it; the final scene is definitely a highlight of the movie. It is also one from which you get more beautiful detail and moving performance than you expect, if you're watching it closely and not concentrating more on your pizza. In this whole final scene, there are a few moments that really got to me, just one being when we hear his music after a pause, calling to him. And just watch Rourke, you get to see him fly in this closing scene! Together with Mansell's score, which I mentioned earlier, it makes for a stunning bit of cinema.<br/><br/>If I have any complaint, it is only that I would have liked to have seen more scenes that developed the relationships between the people further, and told a bit more of an elaborate story in this area, because it is in these scenes I do feel the film is at its strongest and most memorable! But this is a small qualm overall."

","This is a drama about an aging professional wrestler (Mickey Rourke), decades past his prime, who now barely gets by working small wrestling shows in VFW halls and as a part-time grocery store employee. As he faces health problems that may end his wrestling career for good he attempts to come to terms with his life outside the ring: by working full time at the grocery store, trying to reconcile with the daughter (Evan Rachel Wood) he abandoned in childhood and forming a closer bond with a stripper (Marisa Tomei) he has romantic feelings for. He struggles with his new life and an offer of a high-profile rematch with his 1980s arch-nemesis, The Ayatollah, which may be his ticket back to stardom.<br/><br/>Mickey Rourke is always tough, always violent so you can't really expect him to deliver good emotional dialogue. But Rourke said his lines with great emotions and also a sense of toughness underneath. His award-winning performance will be a mark in his long career.<br/><br/>Marisa Tomei isn't to be left out either. Playing mom stripper who is attached to this washed-up wresler is probably one of the best thing she done. Looking good yet emotionally strong, Tomei is absolutely perfect for the role.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky was snubbed from the director race. But the wrestling matches looked stylish and so believable that I think he should've gotten a nod.<br/><br/>The Wrestler is a uplifting drama that has a thin premise, but it was built by a great cast and amazing cinematography"

","Darren Aronofsky's The Wrestler is literally a great movie.It is about an almost down and out,kind of stroke professional wrestler named Ram who has passed on his prime and just wrestlers in Indys(independent promotions).He has no money to pay for the rent of his tiny apartment which is located in a slum and sleeps inside his van,his body has been devastated,his daughter hates him and his only relationship is a friendly one with a 44-year-old stripper named Pam who has also a son.After having a hard attack which almost costs him his life and after being told from the doctors that he must never wrestle again,he decides to try to make up for the things he has done in the past.First of all through some very emotional scenes,he makes things better between him and his daughter Stephanie.Secondly,he creates a relationship between him and Pam(not the customer-employee one).But while he seems to rise from his personal bottom,a complication on the relationship between him and Pam,he strikes rock bottom once again and destroys everything he had done.Then in a situation of desperation,anger and self-hatred he decides to make the big,final comeback and returns in the thing that- according to him- loves the most and is being loved the most,professional wrestling... <br/><br/>Mickey Rourke is extraordinary and deserves to be applauded for making one of the biggest comebacks in cinema's history.The role of the broken physically and emotionally man who has passed on his prime suits perfectly on Mickey Rourke and when his character says ""It's not over until you (pointing at the audience) tell me its over"" and ""I don't hear as good as I used to, and I ain't as pretty as I used to be. But I'm still here"" the things are getting mixed a little bit between real life and the movie.Marisa Tomei and Evan Rachel Wood are very good too in the roles of the soon-to-retire poor stripper and the emotionally hurt and fulled with hatred Stephanie respectively while Darren Aronofsky's direction is once again breathtaking.<br/><br/>To sum up,this movie is not just pointing to wrestling fans but to the whole world about what is behind the big lights,the shinny attires,the pretty faces,the nice bodies and the glamor that people watch in the TV,and should be watched by everyone because of this and of course because of one of the most thrilling returns in the history of cinema,Mickey Rourke's..."

","Extremely downbeat adult drama about an over-the-hill pro wrestler who tries to come to terms with himself after suffering a heart attack. He attempts to reconcile with his only child, takes a job in a grocery store and woos a stripper. Mickey Rourke as the titular character essentially plays Mickey Rourke, a ""bum"" who is struggling to survive after decades of abusive behavior. Marisa Tomei plays the stripper, a character virtually identical to a character she played in a 1990s flick with Christian Slater as a man dying from a heart defect. The film is awfully graphic at times, and depressing just about all of the time. For reasons best known to Rourke and/or the director, this old-time wrestling champ has hair hanging down his back. Most old-time wrestlers are bald, balding or sport very short hair. His hair tends to distract."
"KnightsofNi11","9","0","0","2 November 2010"," Rourke is beyond incredible
","Pro wrestling is fake. That's not even a myth anymore. Pro wrestling is all about the entertainment factor. It's essentially just stunt men who happen to have a shred of acting ability. And yet despite how fake the sport itself is, The Wrestler feels so incredibly real. It's that perfect blend of nitty, gritty, and pretty and you believe every moment of the incredible performances put forth in this film. In it, Mickey Rourke revitalizes his career by playing Randy 'The Ram' Robinson, an aging professional wrestler who is trying to put his life back together inside and outside the ring. Rourke's performance is one of the most notable I've seen in years. The way he consumes his role as the self destructive man who dwells on the past in every aspect of his life is so perfect. I won't go into the atrocity that was not giving him the Best Actor Oscar two years ago, but I'd be lying if I didn't say I was appalled. But not only was Rourke snubbed, the fantastic Marisa Tomei playing opposite him didn't win either. Tomei plays a stripper and assumingly long time friend of Randy's. She plays her conflicting extremely well and just as an added bonus she's naked in more than half of her scenes. It doesn't get much better.<br/><br/>For having only four movies under his belt, Darren Aronofsky has made quite the reputation for himself. After Pi and Requiem for a Dream he established himself as a highly stylized director who excelled in the use of quick cuts and stylish editing. And yet he breaks his own mold in The Wrestler, going for a much more subdued and classical filming style combined with a gritty and realistic use of the hand held cam. The Wrestler still retains a very stylistic feel to it, but not in the same way Aronofsky stylized his first two films. The Wrestler excellently keeps consistent with its style and keeps its pacing subdued. Thats not to say there isn't a shortage of high intensity scenes. In fact quite the opposite. There are a couple unforgettable scenes that are extremely graphic, not so much because of the amount of blood (even though there's a lot) but because of the horrific realism of it all. It's hard not to believe some of the things seen in this movie, and I personally see this as an extremely successful way of drawing me in. Others might be disturbed and completely turned off by it, but it just means it had the same effect on them, only with different results. Either way this movie has a poisonous captivation to it.<br/><br/>I have to give major props to a movie that can break the molds of conventional settings for these kinds of stories. The Wrestler obviously tells the story of an aging, self destructive, self loathing man, something we've seen in many different fashions, but never at all like this. Set in the bizarre world of professional wrestling, this movie presents elements we don't see often, if ever. And it allows for the movie to be equally about Randy's career and its effect on his personal life and vice versa. Interestingly enough, it is, in a way, a reflection of Mickey Rourke's acting career. In Rourke's final speech of the movie he emphasizes that yes, he is still here. He might not be as young, fit, or good looking as before, but he's back whether you like it or not. Every single line of this final speech is a near perfect reflection of both Randy 'The Ram' as a wrestler and Mickey Rourke as an actor. I would have to think that this was intentional, but I don't know for sure.<br/><br/>The Wrestler is gritty, realistic, and will make you invest all your emotions into every moment of this beautiful film. Rourke's performance will go down in history as one of the best and most important roles every portrayed on screen. Every moment is an emotional thrill ride and any imperfections of this film are overshadowed by the pure beauty of it. It is a groundbreaking character study that should not be missed."
"oryx_testes","7","0","0","31 October 2010"," Don't write off the film for ""flaws""
","A documentary style film about a wrestler past his prime, difficult to watch, but ultimately almost masterful. Almost, because as many people have disgustedly pointed out - it has no ending. It just stops, with a smash cut.<br/><br/>It juxtaposes two lives: one, a professional wrestler who deals with the conflict of job and family by trying to put aside the latter, and a stripper who ultimately realises too late she's done the same thing. One is dragging his sequined costume to the end of the line of his career - the stripper is seeing the beginning of the end for hers.<br/><br/>Anyone who complains too much about the triteness of the story should remember that it's actually based on real-life stories of real-life people, there are elements of the lives of Terry Funk (I'm retired, no I'm not), Mick Foley (can't remember things, bodily damage) and Jake the Snake Roberts (estrangement from his daughter), most noticeably. Though no wrestler of Ram's former notoriety has died in the ring, some have found they just simply cannot retire - that life, though its best years are long gone, are akin to a drug that you just can't stop. That's paralleled most hauntingly in the real life CZW wrestler Necro Butcher, appearing as himself, who's not particularly good looking or buff, but instead substitutes a willingness to use a staple gun on his own face to stay in the game. Mickey Rourke has brilliantly managed to capture the essence of a generation of successes and failures in the ring and portray them in their raw glory.<br/><br/>The real casting winner is New Jersey, though. They wanted bleak and hopeless as a backdrop, and in choosing NJ for the role, they overachieved in droves."
"MBunge","9","0","0","21 October 2010"," Like an ode to Kerry Von Erich
","This is a movie you should see if you've ever loved professional wrestling. It's also a movie you should see if you've ever hated professional wrestling. Either way, you'll find a deeper understanding of this violent pantomime that has thrilled millions and killed far too many of its own.<br/><br/>Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson (Mickey Rourke) was a huge star during the wrestling boom of the 1980s. But 20 years later, he's an aging and broken down man out of time. Whatever wealth he had is gone. Whatever future he had, never was. He lives in a trailer, when he's not locked out for failing to pay his rent. He drives a van that looks like it came out of a 1970s slasher film. He dresses like a guy who's been homeless for 3 years. He spends his week unloading trucks at a grocery store. On the weekend, though, that all goes away. He puts on his shiny tights and steps into the ring once again. It's kind of a pathetic life, but it could have gone on for a long time.<br/><br/>Until after a so-called ""hardcore"" match, where Randy gets slashed by barbed wire and has broken glass and tacks embedded in his skin, ""The Ram"" has a heart attack. He wakes up in the hospital and is told he can't ever wrestle again. That finally pushes Randy to re-evaluate his life and his relationships. He actually tries to get a real job. He tries to reconnect with his long-neglected daughter Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood). He tries to get through the tough shell of a stripper named Cassidy and forge a relationship with the single mother named Pam (Marisa Tomei) inside. We learn, however, that if Randy had been capable of getting his life in order¬Öhe'd have done it a long time ago. It's too late for him to stop being ""The Ram"", no matter what it costs.<br/><br/>This story is sad and depressing on a very deep level. If that's not your thing, this probably isn't the film for you. If you can stand it, there's a purity of human emotion to The Wrestler that's quite something. Randy ""The Ram"" isn't a likable character in the traditional sense, but Mickey Rourke takes this loser, this screw up, this bad father and makes you recognize something of yourself in him. Or he makes you see something in him that you wish you had. Maybe Randy's life is ending badly and maybe it's his own fault, but he'll face that end without flinching and no one can really hope for much more than that when their time comes.<br/><br/>It doesn't overstate it to say there's probably no other actor who could have pulled off this role than Mickey Rourke. There may be other performers as talented, yet no amount of make up or Method could measure up to the years of hard living in Rourke's own life. Randy ""The Ram"" is a man who was larger than life and is now worn down to the bone, physically, mentally and emotionally. Only someone like Rourke, who's journeyed through his own wasteland of failure and self-destruction, could allow Randy to be that small and spent and quiet.<br/><br/>Marisa Tomei is also very good as Cassidy/Pam. She mirrors Randy's story as a stripper who has gotten to old for her profession. There just aren't going to be many more good days for Cassidy at the strip club as fewer and fewer guys care to bother with her. And Tomei lets us see the distinction between Cassidy the stripper and Pam the woman and mother. For Pam, Cassidy is just a costume she puts on to make money. She'd rather be her real self but Pam is terribly afraid of showing that to anyone but her son. That's distinguishes her from Randy, who actually prefers his costume to his real self. In fact, he wants Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson to be more real than Robin Ramzinski.<br/><br/>Evan Rachel Wood doesn't have as much to work with as Rourke or Tomei, but she gives her all to the searing anger and hurt in Stephanie. She's not just mad at her father for abandoning her. She's mad at herself for still wanting him to be her dad.<br/><br/>For wrestling fans, this movie will show you how harsh and brutal the lives of your favorite performers can be. For wrestling haters, this film will show you the brotherhood that exists in one of the world's last true carnivals and what it really means to stand in the ring and be the center of everyone's attention, even if it's just a few dozen people in a bingo hall.<br/><br/>I imagine some people mistake Randy Robinson for some version of Hulk Hogan or even Randy ""Macho Man"" Savage, but he's not. Those guys and others like them were smarter and more ambitious. They used wrestling as much as wrestling used them. No, Randy ""The Ram"" is more like what Kerry Von Erich might have become if poor Kerry hadn't killed himself when he was still a relatively young man. Kerry's love of and need for wrestling was so profound and so twisted that even when doctors had to cut off his foot after a motorcycle accident, Kerry had a special prosthetic boot made so he could still get in the ring and perform. The story is that Kerry even showered with his boots on, so his fellow wrestlers wouldn't discover his infirmity. All Kerry Von Erich ever knew was pro wrestling and he couldn't even imagine anything else. Sometimes that level of devotion can lead a man to greatness. The Wrestler is about what happens when it doesn't."

I know a lot of people are disappointed with the ending but sometimes human nature is unpredictable and that is what we didn't expect out of this film.

Yes this movie is a tragedy but that does not mean you can't take the good from the bad. Either way for anyone give it a try. I do know that a lot of people like this movie because of its depiction of wrestling as a sport and its realism toward what happens to some wrestlers when they fade into obscurity.

"estebangonzalez10","8","0","0","16 September 2010"," Rourke is The Wrestler
","The Wrestler is a movie with a lot of heart. Director Darren Aronofsky really touched gold when he decided to choose Mickey Rourke to play Randy the Ram Robinson. Rourke is excellent in this role as he plays a once famous wrestler who begins to be forgotten with his old age, but who decides to continue doing the only thing he knew how to do: wrestle. The excesses of his life has left him a very lonely person with very few friends outside the wrestling arena and who has a daughter with whom he hasn't spoken with in ages. He begins to befriend a stripper played by Marisa Tomei, who at first sees him as a customer but truly has feelings for him. Tomei is a great supportive character in this movie and does a great job and she truly deserved the Oscar nomination. She convinces The Ram to get in touch with her daughter, played equally brilliantly by Evan Rachel Wood (and I must add she got snubbed from a nomination as her work was equally as good as Tomei-s). The dialogue in the movie is great, the loneliness and sadness The Ram is going through is transmitted in a very realistic fashion without the music in the background trying to play with the audiences mood. There are several interesting dialogues like the one Randy says he is just an old broken down piece of meat, the conversations he has with his daughter are very moving and feel real. The struggle he goes through to decide whether he should try to make it in life away from the ring or follow his dream of getting back to the top of his game despite his old age and sickness is what this movie is all about. He has given all his life to wresting and does not know how to survive without it even though the sport has seemed to turn its back on him. Overall this a very touching movie that should be seen by all Mickey Rourke fans and probably has already so I shouldn't have really had to point that out at all."

","I heard about this movie on TV and it looked great. I'm not into wrestling whatsoever, but the beautiful thing about this movie is that it's not really about wrestling. It's more profound than that. It's pretty much about a guy who has one thing in his life: wrestling. And he's great at it. But fast forward 20 years later, he's obviously older and losing his ability to participate in his passion. This is a truly gorgeous film, where the protagonist is also the antagonist. He's just trying to find something to life for. It's tragic, but somehow inspiring. It's an eloquent statement on life after fame.<br/><br/>Mickey Rourke is great in this role. I haven't seen any other work of his but I really want to say it's the best performance of his career. I won't, of course, because I'm too uneducated to say such a thing, but I will say that he was amazing. He truly embodied the character. His walk, his posture, his facial expressions, his delivery of dialogue is all so real. I feel like if I see Rourke in another film I'll just be thinking, ""He's a wrestler. What's he doing here?"" Sometimes I buy movies just for one amazing performance, and if you're the type to do this too, then buy it for his portrayal. It is excellent. I really felt for the guy.<br/><br/>The story is wonderful, and the director's way of telling it is completely effective. He used interesting techniques, great angles. I'm very interested in other work by this director. The music is perfect for the film. I love any movie with '80s rock ballads. Every actor did a great job in their role.

","The Wrestler is the vehicle for Rourke to shine on. It's a film that claws and earns its way to greatness. Perhaps the worst thing is the film is the nearly unreadable font of the opening credits, but after that, it's all excelsior. It's small moments remind me of The Jimmy Show, a terrific, and similarly unsentimental, 2001 film that got as much indifference as this film got hype. Both films are unafraid to show life's unpretty side, but neither film buys into the false heroics of Hollywood endings, nor the false travails of more melodramatic 'indy' films. It also piques one to envision what a truly adult film by the hit and miss director Kevin Smith would be like, since his films are all set in New Jersey, with blue collar folk, as well.<br/><br/>Randy 'The Ram' Ramzinsky is what his daughter claims, screw-up. But, he realizes it. So many of the characters in films, and people in real life, delude themselves into thinking they are things they are not. And it is this sort of strength that makes the film an 'adult' film, not Tomei's nudity (watch the scene where Randy heads down from the supermarket bathroom to enter the deli box, pauses, with the blare of a pro wrestling entrance theme playing, breathes, then enters to the silence of mundane work). More of this is needed. Perhaps Darren Aronofsky, if he's learnt the lessons of this film, can pick up the gauntlet that John Cassavetes tossed down a few decades ago, but which remains on American cinema's floor. If not, at least here's hoping he does not return to his earlier ways. If, instead of navel gazing masturbatory philosophy, a dose of blue collar realism (and no sport is more blue collar than pro wrestling) can work wonders for an artist like Aronofsky, imagine what it can do for the blue collars that watch it. Go ahead, try it, for a change!"

","""In the 'eroticised' body, it is the social function of exchange which predominates. The erotic is never in desire, but in signs."" - Jean Baudrillard <br/><br/>""90s sucked."" ‚Äì The Ram <br/><br/>""The Wrestler"" is a generic but somewhat affecting sports flick about a washed up wrestler who returns to the ring. What's most interesting about the film, though, are the parallels director Darren Aronofsky draws between wrestler Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson and Cassidy, the ageing stripper he's infatuated with.<br/><br/>Both Randy and Cassidy exploit flesh; he exploits his body and various violent impulses in order to make his living as a wrestler, she exploits her body and various sexual impulses in order to make her living as a stripper. Randy is glorified (or glorifies himself) as the masculine ideal in his profession and Cassidy is glorified (or glorifies herself) as the feminine ideal in her profession, both characters spending inordinate amounts of time ""maintaining"" their appearances (Randy is always shaving his chest and armpits, dying his hair etc).<br/><br/>Relics of the 1980s, both characters walk about today like left-over produce from the West's decade of decadence. Both are heavily reliant on superficial consumer ideas of gender, entertainment and fantasy, and both are caught in the trap of constantly maintaining what Baudrillard calls ""flesh capital"", in which everything from sexual performance to self-objectification is a form of work, duties that must be undertaken and perfected if one is to advance themselves. All social relations, in other words, all spheres of human life, become objectified under capitalism, the subject now ""subject as sign"", responsible for advertising and marketing his own body (see Soderbergh's ""The Girlfriend Experience"").<br/><br/>Eventually Cassidy and Ram realise that they can no longer give their bodies over to the generation of affect. They're outdated commodities, Ram linked to cheap 99 cent store aluminium and tacky toys from the 80s (which fail to impress ""modern"" kids), whilst Cassidy discovers that she's not as desirous to her customers anymore. They want younger strippers, not a single mother well into her forties.<br/><br/>In a sense ‚Äì and I seriously doubt Aronofsky intended this - Ram and Cassidy represent a very 21st century ""reliance"" on both planned obsolescence and creeping featurism. Philosopher Vance Packard divides planned obsolescence into two sub categories, obsolescence of desirability (or psychological obsolescence) and obsolescence of function, both of which are tactics used by marketers to either wear out a product in the mind of its owner or to construct a product with a short shelf life. Packard calls this ""the systematic attempt of business to make us wasteful, debt-ridden, permanently discontented individuals."" <br/><br/>Having long been ""phased out"" by the market, Ram's body exhibits a sort of grotesque desperation. Always visiting tanning salons or getting his roots dyed, he is an odd combination of buffness and prettiness, the ghoulish result of a consumer society that valorizes only youth, usefulness and beauty.<br/><br/>Cassidy, who spends much of the film semi-nude, is also a gargoyle of sorts, clinging desperately to the signifiers of sex and worth. Of course there's also some self-reference in the film's casting: Marisa Tomei, who plays Cassidy, is herself an ageing actress who has to drop her clothes and drum up ""naked publicity"" in order to ""further/promote her career"", whilst actor Mickey Rourke, who like ""The Elephant Man"" navigates this film like a heart-string tugging special effect monster, is himself a Botox injected Hollywood freak with his own tinsel town come-back story. Would this film work if we didn't all know Mickey Rourke's personal history? I don't think so. One irony is that his character is only very thinly sketched in the film: it is the media and the Hollywood publicity machine which imbues his character with its ""soul"" and ""history"".<br/><br/>Midway in the film, following a heart attack, Ram stops wrestling and starts working in a meat deli. He moves from a piece of meat to a seller of meat, from a subject-as-object to a pusher of product. Significantly, it is now that he has to wear a name-tag with his real name, Robin Ramzinski. But he resents wearing this name and prefers to go by the title ""Ram"", a direct contrast to Cassidy, who prefers to be known as ""Pam"", a mother struggling to raise a boy alone. In other words, Robin embraces his identity as a performer whilst Cassidy rejects it.<br/><br/>The film ends with The Ram returning to the wrestling ring ‚Äì against his doctor's orders ‚Äì and ""going out in a blaze of glory"". Whether this is a melancholic or triumphant ending is left up to the audience. On one hand, one can view the film's climax as an admittance that unless The Ram is selling his body and soul to the ring, he has nothing. With this depressing reading, The Ram has no life outside the box, and so when the audience applause dies, when the money ceases to come in, he dies as well, spiritually if not physically. <br/><br/>On the other hand, one can look at The Ram's beaten body (the film's packed with hokey Christ metaphors) as the victorious body of labour. By making his body the very product of his labour (literally, a sacrificial ram), Randy liberates himself, he thinks, from the system in which he sells his body to others. Marxist philosopher Gyorgy Lukacs called this, somewhat romantically, the ""artist"" or ""virtuoso"" persona; even when you can't escape being defeated by your class, you can, in theory, take control by exploiting your labour by making your body your own product.<br/><br/>7.9/10 ‚Äì Though marketed as an indie flick, ""The Wrestler"" is pure Hollywood. Despite its R-rating and grungy camera work, its as sugary as Ron Howard's ""Cinderella Man"", filled with the usual genre stereotypes, contrivances and ""one last shot/blaze of glory"" clich√©s. See: ""Requiem for a Heavyweight"", ""Somebody Up There Likes Me"", ""Raging Bull"", ""The Hustler"", ""Body And Soul"" and ""This Sporting Life""."

","This is one movie that I feel couldn't have told its story any better. A lot of that had to do with Mickey Rourke's performance. Maybe the rest was its simplicity and choice of subject. Sure, this same kind of story has already been done about a million times with boxing, or baseball, or football, or some other high profile competition where the star has outlived his prime. But professional wrestling is an underdog. It is often dismissed and ridiculed, even though its just as physically demanding and damaging as any other high contact sport. <br/><br/>Thus it stings a little more when we see the painful lengths Randy goes to in order to put on a show for the half-empty crowd, and the toll it takes on his body. It hurts even more as he struggles awkwardly with his personal life. He's a very flawed and human character, a generally likable guy who has taken a LOT of lumps in his life. And not all of them deserved. To Rourke's credit I often forgot I was watching an actor, and honestly I'm not really sure he WAS acting as much as giving us a look inside his head.

","Even though I don't believe Rourke is the best actor of the year, this is certainly a great performance as a battered, bruised, and conflicted pro wrestler. Wrestling fans will like all the little touches that lend to it's authenticity. As for the character of Robinson, he goes through the gauntlet of emotions ranging from rejection, revival, slight redemption, then ultimately acceptance. Kudos go out to Tomei and Wood, who bring in powerful performances when it counts. Also, kudos to Aronofsky (robbed of an Oscar nod) for his intimate and very personal form of directing, which brings us up close and personal almost throughout. The camera is usually zoned in on the back, giving us an over-the-shoulder view that I believe keeps the audience involved. Overall, a very good film that unfortunately has to be somber throughout."

The emotion in this film is some of the strongest stuff of the 2000's. The sets are very believable. Unlike Rocky it doesn't have a big score, but that does make it feel like your watching a real former wrestler's life. Mickey Rourke deserved an Oscar for his performance. Sean Penn did a good job in Milk, but Rourke deserved it way more. The biggest complaint that people have with the film is that it copies Rocky.

","""The Wrestler"" is a powerful study of a man who has gone from the top of the world to the bottom of it. <br/><br/>Mickey Rourke (in an excellent performance) is Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson, a legendary professional wrestler who headlined events for years. He is now wrestling for an independent circuit on weekends in small auditoriums. What's more, Robinson is involved in hardcore matches, which are no picnic. When he is not wrestling, the protagonist tries to find work in the meat department at a grocery store . During his free time, he visits the local strip club, where Cassidy (Marisa Tomei) works. <br/><br/>After one of the hardcore contests, Robinson suffers a heart attack in the locker room. After he wakes up in a hospital bed, his doctor tells him that changes in his lifestyle must be made, and that he has no choice. One of the changes is that he can never wrestle again. If Robinson does not follow this order, it could mean serious consequences.<br/><br/>Once Cassidy finds out what happened to Robinson, she asks him about his daughter, whom he hasn't seen in years. Because of Robinson's status as a wrestler, he was constantly on the road. This resulted in missed birthdays, holidays, and other important events in his daughter's life. Obviously, this created a rift in their relationship. <br/><br/>With help from Cassidy, Robinson decides to see his daughter, Stephanie. Initially, she does not want to see him, but she does spend time with him. Will their relationship heal after so many years? As for Robinson, he hears that a special twentieth anniversary match between he and a fellow wrestler is in the works. The match they had was a major one at that time, and Robinson contemplates participating, knowing what could happen.<br/><br/>Tomei is good as Cassidy , and Evan Rachel Wood gives a nice performance as Stephanie. The wrestling scenes can make someone squeamish, so you have been warned. <br/><br/>Another aspect of the film I want to talk about is the title itself: The Wrestler. This title has two meanings. One of them is self-explanatory, and has been talked about in this review. The other is that Robinson is wrestling with life. He was a man who was probably as popular as Hulk Hogan (I read somewhere that the Ram was modeled after Hogan), and looking at him now, you would not know it. There are several scenes that convey this message, especially early on when Robinson goes home. Just look at where home is. It is not a place you would expect a well known wrestler to be residing. The title may seem plain, but it is brilliant.<br/><br/>Overall, I have nothing bad to say about this movie. I try not to take awards shows seriously, but if Rourke had won Best Actor for this at the Oscars, I feel he would have deserved it. A Best Picture nomination would have been justified, too. <br/><br/>My conclusion: This is worth watching."
"barzilla82","10","0","0","18 June 2010"," Finally the 1980s has a voice
","I love this movie. It is about a fictional wrestler played by Mickey Rourke. The wrestler in the film was a big star in the 1980s but now his star has faded and he continues to wrestle in private matches that aren't televised. He hasn't gotten over the 80s and he hates the 90s. I actually had my own issues with the 1990s. I was horrified when around 1990 and 1991 MTV stopped showing glam metal videos and started showing rap and pop music videos all the time.It was a scary experience and last I checked a few weeks ago, MTV is still showing rap videos like crazy, so the scary experience is ongoing.<br/><br/>The wrestler character is aging and he continues to wrestle, using steroids to keep himself muscular and getting tans at tanning salons. He also still has long hair. His favorite music is the 1980s glam metal and sleaze metal. That includes bands like Cinderella, Motley Crue, and Guns N' Roses. The interesting thing about that era of rock music is that when it went out of style, it didn't just kind of go out of style, it totally went out of style. If you bring up 1980s glam rock music in conversation, your likely to be met with revulsion and disgust. Because that music had tasteless and revolting lyrics, its downfall is generally considered to be deserved.<br/><br/>The wrestler has a daughter who doesn't' like him. I got the impression from what he says in the film that he wasn't around much when she was growing up. He also is friends with a stripper played by Marissa Tomei. Marissa Tomei is totally cool in this film and I hope to see her in more movies.<br/><br/>The wrestler character acts as a voice for the 1980s which is good since people these days are turned off by that decade. While many people are turned off by the 80s, I loved it. It was a time of innocence, there was lots of fantasy and sci fi movies coming out and many people who live today grew up in that era, so it is special to them."

His performance was worthy of an academy award. Watching him, one feels his frustration, his physical pain, and his deep desire to recapture his youth. Marisa Tomei's character ""Cassidy/Pam"" is a female parallel to Randy, and Tomei brings Pam to life as well, appearing all but nude in much of the film and somehow conveying the very unsexy desperation of her profession.

I didn't see this movie until long after it was released on DVD. It was a shining title yet a small one, it didn't stand out among the other titles on my shelf such as ""Pulp Fiction"" or ""Platoon"". Even after I bought it I didn't put it in and take the time to watch it. Yet after I did I was sorry I hadn't watched it sooner. The acting was superb as well as the story in its self. The movie may be named ""The Wrestler"" but that may not be all that it is about. In the End I think it really alludes to the fact that once you are no longer on top no one cares.

","I saw ""The Wrestler"", last night, and it was compelling. From a screenwriter's point of view, I would have to call it an 'alternative screenplay'. It does not follow the traditional formula for a story arc. Many of the scenes do not build up to any tension; yet they are filled with subtext. I like the way the wrestlers are showed as buddies, before they going in the ring (note: the wrestlers shown as extras were all professional wrestlers). I think Mickey Rourke did an extraordinary performance because he was NOT playing himself, as so many people have stated that he was. He played a likable and sympathetic character, despite his faults. In reality, he is not likable, at all. That is what makes it a good acting job. The alternative part comes in when his character never goes through any change - regrets, yes, but he does not change. And, without spoiling anything, I must say I was moved to tears by the ending."

","Mickey Rourke is certainly one of the most glaring cases of squandered talent in Hollywood history. Back in 1982, he costarred in the cult classic Diner and critics hailed him as a new James Dean, however in the 27 years since, he has been more known for his irresponsible bad boy behavior and his abortive attempt to become a boxer then for his movie credits. He had an amazing talent to turn down good roles like in Beverly Hills Cop and The Untouchables and take bad ones like Harley Davidson And The Marlboro Man. However, he finally made a wise choice in accepting this role. He won over a dozen major awards for his portrayal of Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson and to me he earned them all. This is certainly a dark sad film in the classic ""film noir"" sense. There literally isn't a happy moment in it. Randy The Ram was once on the top of the wrestling world, the Muhammad Ali of wrestling. Now it is twenty years since his last great match and he is living in a run down trailer park and wrestling before tiny audiences at the bottom of tank town. He tries and fails to form a relationship with his estranged daughter. There is a heartbreaking scene where he gets drunk and misses dinner with her and she throws him out for good telling him its broken beyond repair with him. You look at this sad shell of a man and you realize what he means when he says that the ring is what he loves because its the world outside that really hurts him. Marisa Tomei is also great in this film as the stripper with a heart of gold he flirts with. You can sense her character's pain as well as she tries to balance being a loving mother with her sleazy profession. Tomei was wonderful in My Cousin Vinny and brought home Oscar gold, but her career never took off like it should. I am glad she won praise for this as well. Rourke's greatest moment in the end is the speech he makes to the audience before the rematch when he tells them how he may be down but isn't out! Its a speech that would have made Sylvester Stallone proud. SPOILER ALERT its insinuated that he is having a fatal heart attack in the match and the last shot is of him leaping off the rope. I felt that it would be the only appropriate end for the Ram to die in the ring. He didn't have a happy life but at least could have a happy death. A sad ending for a brilliant but sad film."

","Everybody has known Mickey Rourke can act for years. So why did he fall off the radar screens in Hollywood for so long? Lots of actors behave strangely off camera, so why use this as the excuse like so many have? Anyway, Mickey Rourke should have no trouble getting good work for a while after this incredible effort as an aging pro wrestler nearing the end of the line. Yes, Sean Penn was very good in Milk, but Rourke deserved that Oscar. A little Brokeback guilt still out there, perhaps? Rourke plays a man known as Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson. Back in the late 1980s, he was apparently a huge success in the business. Maybe not a Hulk Hogan, but still a champion in his own right. Now, twenty years later, Randy finds himself physically spent, broke, and without any close friends or family. He lives in a trailer that he can't always afford, and he drives a crumby Dodge Ram van. He spends his free time hitting on an aging (though still very sexy!) stripper played by Marisa Tomei. Obviously, he'd like to start a relationship with her, but she clearly thinks of him as just a customer. At least initially. I swear I kept waiting for her to tell him she was married, but I guess she wasn't. Randy also attempts to mend fences with his daughter, but this goes poorly as he sleeps through a dinner date with her and seems to kill any chance of a reconciliation. And worse than anything else perhaps, Randy suffers a heart attack after a brutal match and it looks like he will have to retire from the only thing he's good at! Sheesh! Rourke is simply sensational as you will totally believe him in this role. He handles each scene exactly as his character must. He's tough as hell in the ring, but really a great guy out of it. Notice one scene where he has to work behind a deli counter at a supermarket. Once he quickly learns the ropes, he does a great job helping customers and using a good sense of humor. Until one notices who he really is.... then things get ugly. Rourke must have done some roids or HGH to get his 50+ yr old body looking like that. But the real Randy Robinson would have done them too, so who cares? And his wrestling moves look decent enough for a veteran grappler. Better than anything Hogan ever did, anyway. Marisa Tomei is a woman that doesn't get enough good parts like this. It really must be true that women over 40 cannot get many good roles in Tinseltown these days. She's a great performer, and she took a huge chance with this role. Someone give her some more good parts! And you gotta love the soundtrack with mostly 80s hair metal bands! Quiet Riot, Accept, Ratt, Guns N Roses, Firehouse and Cinderalla are heard here. And Cobain gets properly dissed for ending their reign.<br/><br/>Spoiler Part! The film is not quite perfect, as it is a bit on the predictable side. But luckily, the film spares us a potentially melodramatic ending where we see him die in the ring. A hack writer might have had him die as his opponent was being counted out or something. He probably didn't live much past this final match, if he made it through at all. At least this is left for us to speculate on only. 9 of 10 stars.<br/><br/>The Hound."

It appears to be an allegory of American empire. The most fundamental problem with it artistically, is that it describes the problem, but offers no solutions. That was great when Kate Chopin did it.

Rourke and Tomei were an instant classic pair in the film world, reminding me of very few on-screen relationships, but mirroring many real-life relationships of the man chasing the woman. As a description to non-wrestling fans who are interested in seeing this, I would most comparably call it the ""R"" rated Rocky Balboa, but with a little less glamor and ""Cinderella"" effect. The violence is strong for a non-wrestling viewer, but infrequent, and only really strong during one match. Movie is well-paced but almost too slow for some. NOT an action flick!

"pyrocitor","8","0","0","26 May 2009"," Like its protagonist, very familiar yet brutally authentic and packing a hefty clout
","For certain films, the particular package proves so impeccably assembled that it is near impossible to imagine an alternate outcome, and there are few better examples than Darren Aronofsky's The Wrestler. Initially planned as a Nicholas Cage vehicle of all things, enough literature has been devoted to the poignant parallelism between the film's protagonist, former 1980s superstar wrestler Randy 'The Ram' Robinson and star Mickey Rourke and the authenticity of Rourke's casting to fill several books. And while the abundance of praise bestowed on Aronofsky's film threatens to oversell the product itself (""Witness the resurrection of Mickey Rourke"" one poster quote boasts), The Wrestler remains one of those rare films which hint at a real truth behind layers of cinematic constructs, making it, if not quite ""the next Raging Bull"" as many would have it, a captivating and visceral watch. <br/><br/>Rather than challenging assertions of popular wrestling being staged, Aronofsky seems to relish them, casting an unflinchingly critical gaze upon its primarily theatrical nature, and showing his wrestlers warmly hugging before matches, talking through the fight and going out for beers afterward - a far cry from the vicious bloodlust shown in the ring. But neither does Aronofsky dismiss his chosen sport on the grounds of inauthenticity, but simultaneously finds much to appreciate and celebrate in wrestling, from the careful choreography in the ring and stage presence of the stars, to the sheer dogged determination they display towards their craft - in one particularly gruesome scene, Randy, secretly takes a concealed razor blade and slits his forehead, to finish the match bathed in a grotesque shroud of blood. <br/><br/>In fact, Aronofsky's both critical and celebratory treatment of wrestling proves representative of his film as a whole. Functioning primarily as a character study of 'The Ram', The Wrestler is, on the surface, a devastatingly bleak film, with Aronofsky refusing to shy away from the character's fall from glory into a truly pitiful state, his pumped up body steadily withering away, and his life reduced to solitary shambles, while still coasting by on his glory days from twenty years ago. Aronofsky intriguingly explores the harrowing outcome of what to do when the one thing a person knows how to do is no longer possible when their body gives out on them, and the pitiful search for scraps of meaning afterward - a theme paralleled by Marisa Tomei's struggling stripper. But, like many such career reflective films as John Wayne's The Shootist and Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven, Aronofsky refuses to let his deflated superstar fade away, emasculated, but instead dignifies him with a final, triumphant bout of glory.<br/><br/>In fact, the similarities to the aforementioned westerns become increasingly inescapable as the main criticism towards Aronofsky surfaces. Much like Randy himself, the film, despite its indisputable power, feels very familiar, yet another retread of a common template seen in everything from heist or crime films (the oh so stereotypical ""one last job"") to the aforementioned Raging Bull, to just about any genre proving introspective on masculinity and heroism. As such, the blend between the brutally authentic and the film's playing on the familiar makes for a touch of an imbalanced and less immersive watch at times. Similarly, as paradoxical a criticism as it may seem in such a despairingly dark film, Aronofsky is equally unafraid to lay on the sentiment, and at times, while the infusion of humour and warmth into the film is often a welcome reprieve, they do come on as a little strong, as if attempting to overcompensate for the film's overall more sombre tone (the collection of soft spoken, polite and frequently hugging and cheering fellow wrestlers is perhaps a step too far away from the stereotype). But many of the film's lighter moments are far too genuinely heart-warming to object to, as Randy's impromptu playing packaged meat football with his deli customers, struggling to comprehend a young neighbourhood boy's explanations of the game Call of Duty 4 while playing an old Nintendo wrestling game, and his clumsy attempts to win back his estranged daughter among others appear merciful pinholes of hope amidst a veil of fatalism. Similarly, Aronofsky's use of jittery, naturalistic cinematography dispels fears of the film becoming overly cinematic, while maintaining a veneer of grim authenticity to the film. <br/><br/>While it may seem particularly ironic that the part of a former titan fading away should provide so much of a career reboot for star Mickey Rourke, the indisputable power and poignancy of his performance easily merits every last scrap of hype. Rouke is a triumph, complimenting Randy's cocky, superstar swagger with a humiliating limp, and proving just at adapt at heartbreakingly weeping over his abandoned relations with his daughter as casting a bold grin around a roaring wrestling ring - a nuanced, beautifully naturalistic and innately likable portrait of masculinity at its most stunted. Marisa Tomei is also exceptional as ageing stripper Cassidy, forced to confront her declining body as she is turned away by customers. Tomei's performance is just as willfully honest in the midst of its haunting character flaws as Rourke's, and while she may deliver less raw dramatic intensity, hers is more of a quiet, slow burning bit of characterisation which ultimately proves just as resonant. Evan Rachel Wood is also devastatingly believable as Randy's cast away daughter, with Wood providing an achingly wounded soul underneath her character's mask of indignant fury towards her father - the scenes between her and Rourke provide the vast majority of the film's most beautiful and tragic moments. <br/><br/>Just as mesmerizing a treatment of ageing and society's reaction to it as a hauntingly poignant character study and introspective analysis of popular entertainment, The Wrestler packs a devastating emotional punch and enough surprises to make up for its predictable narrative arc and periodic excesses of sentiment. For any audiences willing to stomach its bleak and brutal content, Aronofsky's film should be considered compelling and vital viewing. <br/><br/>-8.5/10"

","This Aronofsky movie was almost perfect-it is hard to imagine any scene being left out. From the opening frame to the end, I was mesmerized by the story of Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson. By the time we meet him, Randy is wearing a hearing aid and barely eking out an existence from wrestling--we are witnessing the tail-end of his career, and possibly his life. When he has a heart attack, he realizes how alone he is and he tries to reach out to people he cares about, like a local stripper and his daughter. The cinematography in this film was fantastic, as each frame emphasizes just how alone Randy is---the scene where he leaves the hospital and goes out to the empty parking lot to get his van is a great example. After his heart attack, Randy realizes he can no longer wrestle and he tries to get a normal job and assimilate back into the non-wrestling world, but he quickly realizes that the only place he really matters to anyone is in the ring--it is there that he feels truly appreciated and loved by his fans. Mickey Rourke has a truthfully brilliant performance in this film and one can easily see the parallels to his own acting career and life. Go rent this film immediately--you will not regret it."
"Buddy-51","9","0","0","26 April 2009"," When the actor becomes the role
","Darren Aronofsky's superb drama ""The Wrestler"" provides Mickey Rourke with the role for which he will undoubtedly be most remembered - that of ""Randy 'the Ram' Robinson,"" a professional wrestler long past his prime, who is attempting to mount a comeback both as a fighter and as a father to the daughter (beautifully played by Rachel Evan Ward) whom he abandoned earlier in life.<br/><br/>Rarely does an actor get the chance to inhabit a role quite as fully as Rourke does here. With his bulging muscles and greasy, long-flowing, bleach-dyed locks, Rourke - who did his own stunts for the film - brings an amazing physicality to the character, making us feel every ache, pain and body blow the man suffers, both inside the arena and out, as he hauls his massive, badly bruised carcass through life. Randy shows that he suffers no illusions about that life, as he confesses to his daughter, ""I'm an old broken-down piece of meat, and I'm alone and I deserve to be alone."" But there's something about Randy - call it his gentleness of spirit or his self-effacing modesty - that nevertheless wins us over to his side. Indeed, for all his physical imposingness, Randy is a surprisingly tender individual who knows he's screwed up in life and now wants to make amends and rebuild bridges with the one person he cares most about in his life.<br/><br/>This ""soft"" side of Randy is most evident in his relationship with ""Cassidy,"" a stripper who is herself getting on in years. In fact, Randy and Cassidy are united in the fact that they are both trapped in professions that are less than kind to those who are aging. Even though the role of Cassidy could easily have slipped over into the-stripper-with-a-heart-of-gold territory, the intelligence of the writing and the subtle richness of Marisa Tomei's performance prevent that from happening.<br/><br/>Screenwriter Robert D. Siegel keeps the story spare and simple, not cluttering it up with fancy narrative flourishes or overblown melodramatics. With the wintry coastal New Jersey setting as his backdrop, director Aronofsky lets the drama unfold at a seductively leisurely pace, letting us get to know each of these characters and the rhythm of their lives in finely-drawn, intimate detail. And even though Rourke has elicited richly deserved praise for the physical pounding he endured for the role, it is in the quieter and subtler moments, when we get to see the inner workings of the character he's portraying, that the actor's talent and dedication to the role truly shine through. It is, indeed, a performance for the ages and one that students of acting will be studying and attempting to emulate for decades to come."

","Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson (Rourke) is a burnt out top pro-wrestler, has a heart attack, but still wants to compete one last time.<br/><br/>I guess Thomas Wolfe may not have been entirely correct. You can go home again if you are either a top pro wrestler or a Class A actor who hasn't acted in years. This story is about both the wrestler and the actor (in my mind only) and the road has not been easy for either one. <br/><br/>This is tough to watch because we are probably privy to the way pro wrestling really works and it is brutal. I had to avert my eyes with some scenes. Yes, I know about movie magic, but hey, it was rough. I figured I either had to be in shape to watch this or be somewhat crazy. Say what you will about pro wrestling, but these guys are in shape. No doubt about that. And, some of the things they do won't be shown on television -- not that I watch. <br/><br/>The problem for me was that I couldn't separate the wrestler from the actor. I want both to succeed. It was personal for Mr. Rourke and that wasn't all acting the way I saw it. And, that being the case I would not have nominated him for Best Actor. When it's personal, it's real. <br/><br/>The story was good. There is a good mix of The Ram taking part time jobs to help with the bills, and trying to get back with the daughter he abandoned years ago; and he takes up with Stripper Pam (Tormei).<br/><br/>The production is good, and the pace is excellent. It's a good story. <br/><br/>Were The Wrestler and the Actor able to go home again? Ah, you think you know the answer about the Wrestler, because you may have seen the movie.

","In wrestling as in show business, the name of the game is performance. No longer considered to be a sport, wrestling is now a mixture of violent pantomime and self-destruction in the name of entertainment. In Darren Aronofsky's fourth film, The Wrestler, Mickey Rourke plays Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson, a professional wrestler who has seen better days. Twenty years after a wrestling career that generated posters, ""Randy The Ram"" action figures and a video game, he is unable to compete in major tournaments and barely able to maintain a run down trailer in a New Jersey suburb. Randy, now a beaten-up relic of his former self, can only compete with younger performers in amateur contests, battering his body further by crashing into glass, being stapled by staple guns, and ingesting painkillers and steroids. <br/><br/>In his first film since the under-appreciated The Fountain, Aronofsky has created a powerful and involving drama in which Mickey Rourke's performance is a tour-de-force reminiscent of Robert de Niro in Raging Bull. Rourke, on the comeback trail after a boxing career and reconstructive surgery on his face, is completely believable as the washed-up wrestler whose only companions are loneliness and remorse. To a background of eighties metal rock, Randy drives around town in a Dodge Ram van that holds an action figure of himself on the dashboard. During the week he loads boxes and mans the deli counter at the Acme supermarket in New Jersey, while on the weekends he performs at American Legion halls in the ridiculous costumes that wrestlers wear.<br/><br/>Written by Robert Siegel, a former editor of ""The Onion"", the film has two subplots which divert our attention from the physical violence only to endure pain of a different sort, the kind in which the bleeding comes from the heart. One features Marisa Tomei as a fortyish stripper and lap dancer named Cassidy who, in spite of Randy's persistence, refuses to treat him as anything other than a paying customer. Trying to raise a nine-year old boy by herself, Cassidy is another example of someone who knows that she should quit but is forced by economic circumstances to go on.<br/><br/>The other sub-plot revolves around Randy's estranged daughter Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood) who lives with a surly black woman and is most unwelcome to Randy's overtures for reconciliation. Understandably bitter over her father's abandonment of the family when she needed him the most, Stephanie softens enough to go on an outing with her dad but any attempt at a new beginning is squashed when Randy does not show up for a lunch date. Although the offense does not seem that grievous to us, given the extent of Stephanie's anger, if it wasn't this incident, it would probably have been another.<br/><br/>Aronofsky shows the consequences of all the body slamming, physical bludgeoning, and cuttings with razor blades in the form of a heart attack that overcomes Randy after a match. The film is predictable in the sense that, after Randy's heart attack and emotional end to his job in the deli counter, we still sense that his pain will not be too great to opt for a major comeback. Yet to the extent that we are drawn into Randy's character, want him to succeed, yet do not know where the film will ultimately take us, The Wrestler delivers very satisfying results. Though violent and ugly at times, it is an honest film, often funny and quite intimate, a film that anyone who has suffered humiliation at some point in their life can relate to. Here there is no triumph of victory or agony of defeat, only life in all its pain and all its grace."

Beauty is self-defining, captures every ray of light, and manages to justify our existence. The camera comes to life every time she enters the frame.<br/><br/>I lived back East in the 70's and early 80's when pro wrestling was grub-staking its way out of the city soot and brick stadiums. Driving a taxicab between jobs, I got to know strippers . . . dated a few, even drove and body-guarded one who was on the hook after-hours.<br/><br/>This film got it right.<br/><br/>Mickey Rourke was Aronofsky's entr√©e into the wrestler world.

","The Wrestler, is a portrayal of a once been to a has been clinging to a last chance at redemption in his hopes to reclaim his glory and make reparation for all that he gave up along the ways to success and was not able to reconnect to after his downfall from stardom. I really enjoyed this film. Aronofsky nailed the world of wrestling. It made me recall the days when Saturday morning was filled with Hulk Hogan, Randy Macho Man, Jake the Snake...the Warrior and all those guys. I found that the battles the Ram fought inside the ring and within himself in connection to his sport was much more invigorating to watch rather than his battles to find love with stripper Cassidy and from his estranged daughter Stephanie.The locker room scenes and scenes of Randy's everyday life were well done, but every scene with Cassidy was just predictable, boring and clich√©. The film could be equally powerful and strong if she never was seen on screen and just another part of his life we know he lost and will never reclaim. However, I often think that perhaps this part of the story may have been better if recast; Evan Rachel Wood has yet to win me over.But thank heavens Mickey Rourke is back what I hope is better than ever, ready to reclaim his own stardom...lets just hope it does not mirror that of Randy's."

","There is something undeniably haunting about Mickey Rourke's performance in ""The Wrestler,"" to the point where, a week after having watched the film, nuances and lines still stick in my mind. Excepting ""The Fountain,"" the films of Darren Aronofsky have had a similarly lingering effect on my conscience, but more so in their aesthetic presentation (culminating in the shrewd technical dexterity of visual effects). And ""The Wrestler"" is founded on subject matter (a downbeat tale of a pro's descent into obsolescence) that echoes the clinically detailed stories of ""Pi"" (a mathematical character piece by way of Polanski) and ""Requiem for a Dream"" (a tale of street-smart junkies and their individual spirals into addiction and degradation). Considering my lack of familiarity toward Rourke's past notoriety and his filmography in general (counting ""The Wrestler,"" I've only seen four of his films), I can fairly objectively say that his performance is what largely buoys the film overall¬ñwhile Robert Siegel's script tends to be episodic and fragmented (and Aronofsky cuts it together like a string of vignettes), it never forgets its focus, as Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson (Rourke) is prevalent in every scene, the camera stalking him wherever he goes (not unlike a festering tabloid camera looking for a story). ""The Wrestler"" is filled with deliberate anachronisms, from the authentic New Jersey locales (that look efficiently frozen in the mid-1980s), the use of an 8-bit Nintendo system (as Randy plays a game based on his celebrity), the VHS tapes Randy and his faded contemporaries sell at a depressing ""convention,"" and a soundtrack populated exclusively by eighties hair metal bands. Rourke manifests his role with grace and a burdensome sadness; his attempts to reconnect with his estranged daughter (Evan Rachel Wood)¬ña subplot that sometimes feels forced¬ñcome across as emotionally genuine, a man trying to make amends even though he realizes it's a losing battle. Marisa Tomei also shines as an aging stripper who is struggling with her own obsolescence as the world turns its eyes to the young and vigorous."
"zoltangyalog","7","0","0","15 March 2009"," Challenging Time Again
","Darren Aronofsky's latest installment, The Wrestler inspects human body and inherent spirit. Once you are in the wrestling show business where all focal attractions do demand a body of granite and a soul of masterfully mimicked super-dominance, then you and all your Fans know that your body can't quit on you. That it truly NEVER will. You are not a mortal, rather a super-product, a mythical phenom, a Demigod. Did you believe that? According to popular belief, even better/worse, experience: every body quits. That's why everybody quits. Uhm. It is a question of when, not a question of if. According to our current knowledge, at least.<br/><br/>The name of the game is rather straightforward here: this is good, old fashioned, raw cinematic narration without all the detail work Aronofsky is fond of using. Not this time though: the rawness of the environment - inner/spiritual and outer environment - this story unfolds in demands to place you in a position in which you could scientifically relate to the imminent/evident stench of colliding male bodies. The bodies that are criticized by many, having no clue with two lost holes in it about how demanding it is to do what these entertainers are doing. And there is no proper place and proper time to rest, either. The next match is always coming up, regardless how well the wrestler performed a couple of weeks ago. The protagonist of the story is in a constant escape. He escapes from a painfully blank, solitary reality on a match-to-match basis, exhibiting his run in front of the Fans, FOR the Fans. There is no quitting for the spirit, there is no quitting for the body, neither.<br/><br/>Mickey Rourke's portrayal of '80's Wrestling Phenom Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson is as close to flawless as you will ever care wishing for. This is a hardened, still-muscular, wrinkly soul in a hardened, still-muscular, wrinkly body. Body though ages, and the soul may remain playful. So eager to deliver. So ready to please the grateful Fans or to fuel the passion of everyday average haters. Does not matter.<br/><br/>What matters is: to be reacted to. Being reacted to is what defines a Star. Once reaction time is over: Stardom is over. When you finally check on your watch though to see if time indeed have passed you by, then there is the painfully blatant potentiality of a possible realization - shocking you to the very core, needles to say - that it just: had, indeed.<br/><br/>The film delivers solid humane drama as you witness a Randy Robinson who has absolutely NO ONE and NOTHING in his life. No one and nothing except the Fans, whom are distant admirers of a distant, pretty much mythological figure. They have zero relation towards- and interest in Randolph Robinson. A Superstar Wrestler is not a human, oh, come on, did you truly believe that they are? No. They indeed pack considerate charisma and consorting, absolutely amazing human autonomy, each blown deliberately to Larger Than Life, even Larger Than You Could Imagine size.<br/><br/>The point comes when Rourke's character has to face with the fact that his Over The Top Persona is no longer sustainable by the body his spirit is occupying. A spirit that is forced to be restless, a spirit that always have been forced to be restless, so it could generate profit in a ring that dictates rules by the amount of pain one signs on for. The film reveals necessary ignorance towards what the body would recognize as a comfortable pace, as result of the constant necessity to perform. The necessity to deny the ¬ñ check this - reality of reality. Because only the Fans do represent the aspect of reality that the Wrestler lives and performs for.<br/><br/>What fuels this inner stance is the constant urge, even need, to force the body to function as that of a Superhuman. Rourke's character challenges Time, telling the Ultimate Conqueror that he is still capable of doing what he could do in prime times. Time accepts the challenge.<br/><br/>As mentioned, The Wrestler is solid drama. Raw and honest drama. The best aspect of the installment is that it remains entirely truthful to its main agenda of keeping these admirable qualities intact, non-tinkered with. The Ram's extremely scarce interpersonal relationships are portrayed precisely. A disappointed daughter is delivered as an acceptable aspect, yet, the relationship between Rourke's character and a prostitute acquaintance tells even more about the Ram. There is a scene in which the protagonist has absolutely no one to turn to, so he chooses to express his doubts and feelings towards his prostitute acquaintance. The woman's reaction is a perfect representation of how Rourke's character is situated in this world.<br/><br/>Aronofsky's newest delivery to date does not want you to drop your jaw in amazement, neither it wants to pick it up and put it in places a decent girl never even heard of. Instead, this motion picture delivers a thorough portrayal of a human state of saddening solitary and remembered, dim fame. The Ram remains a Fighter, nevertheless. A Fighter who has Faith, a Faith that remains Indestructible. You know what Faith is? It is the thing you lose if you did not even have it.<br/><br/>The Ram remembers joy, and there is nothing more sour than but the remembrance of joy. This particular remembrance comes to the protagonist as a persistent shadow, leaving us to wonder if is it but the shadow, or is it the tired flesh that tells us more honestly about who the Wrestler really is. A dim fame may always come back to haunt you in its full glory, once you start to long for it for the sufficient time and with the sufficient passion. The question is, which The Ram has to face with, as well: is it advisable to desire that fame again, or is it more fruity to let it go? <br/><br/>opiniononion.blogspot.com"

You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today and then one day you find ten years have got behind you, no one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun.</li></ul><br/><br/>And you run and you run to catch up with the sun, but it's sinking. And racing around to come up behind you again. The sun is the same in the relative way, but you're older, shorter of breath and one day closer to death. -<br/><br/>Time, 20 years ago, the 80s, good times or bad times but unique times for sure. Guns N' Roses' track from their album Appetite for Destruction ""Sweet Child O' Mine"" reached the #1 position of the Billboard hot 100 and like Guns N' Roses' our main character was in the 80s at the top of his career, as a professional wrestler Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson (Mickey Rourke) had a tremendous time during the 80s, memorable matches, success. At one point we have Randy and his friend (Marisa Tomei) hanging in a bar, they have a similar taste for music and Randy says something like ""I hated the f****** 90s"" and also stuff against Cobain. We can imagine that Randy said that not only in reference to the music but also to how he lived during the decade after his best decade as a professional wrestler. <br/><br/>The present for Randy consist in living alone, working at a supermarket and wrestling during the weekends at local small places. Three wrestling matches in the film; we certainly take a look inside the world of wrestling, we see how there is a big respect to Randy from all the wrestlers we see, the respect is mutual, after all they all are colleagues. As you know pro wrestling is a show, here there's always the previous chat between Randy and his next rival about what they are going to do for the audience (there's also that detail of Randy cutting himself). Personally I like pro wrestling, I enjoy sometimes the whole show (and the movies of Santo and Blue Demon!) but I don't really have a favourite wrestler, I'm just not a big fan, I can't be. Anyway, here especially with the second match we see pro wrestling as nothing but a real thing, I like this part of Roger Ebert's review of The Wrestler: ""Pro wrestling is a fake sport, right? Yes, but as an activity, it's pretty real. It's scripted that the villain sneaks up on the hero, who pretends not to see him, and pushes him over the ropes and out of the ring. Fake. But when the hero hits the floor, how fake is that? ""Those guys learn how to fall,"" people tell me. Want to sign up for the lessons?"". That mentioned second match is an extreme one, a delight for the fans (a really fantastic little moment when Randy please his fans by using the prosthetic leg of one of them, who is the happiest fan in the place, to hit his rival!) but after this match we are pretty sure the days of Randy as a professional wrestler are over. The situation in the present days of Randy was always difficult, how a once very successful professional wrestler ended suffering to pay the rent is not for our interest, the only thing we have now is that a man has nothing but more disappointments during an already difficult period of his life. Now the body says ""no more""; a situation like the bypass operation that had Randy, as Marisa Tomei's characters remarks, usually bring people together. <br/><br/>I haven't seen yet Gus Van Sant's Milk, actually I don't really want to see it (I only really want to see, from those movies that are right now in theaters, Watchmen and Clint Eastwood's Changeling). I'm writing this in reference to what happened exactly two weeks ago in the Oscars, certainly Rourke was the favourite and with that you know that enough has been said about how Rourke resurrected with this project. He is GREAT, I didn't expect less. Marisa Tomei plays the character of the striper who has this special relation with one of her customers who is of course Randy. Tomei is really good but for me is not a great performance (still she deserved the damn Oscar just for those lap dance scenes). Certainly these two, Randy and Pam, share things (there's this one scene in which some customers don't want Pam since she is old. Also Pam has a son), and there's that thing with Pam saying: ""I can't, you're just another customer, I can't be with customers"" and Randy responding ""well I'm a customer then I want a f****** dance"". She is also the one who will lead is know that Randy has a daughter (good performance of beautiful Evan Rachel Wood), probably of the thing that Randy is more regretful about is that he practically abandoned his daughter, now we know Randy and we had been following him so we know he really want the best for the difficult relation with his daughter and there's that moment after for once Randy saw something outside a ring, pretty much a damn unfortunate moment that will make that Randy sees the wresting world again as his only world. Not entirely a masterpiece but The Wrestler is just another worth watching work from Darren Aronofsky."

","I had so many prejudices against this movie I almost missed it: a Micky Rourke movie, a wrestling movie. How could I enjoy such a combination? Well, word of mouth thankfully won me over and managed not to miss one of the most hearth-wrenching, beautifully written, directed and acted movies of 2008.<br/><br/>The movie is as brilliant as it's simple: Randy The Ram Robinson is a washed out wrestler whose time of glory was in the '80s until an epic fight that ended his career. Now he works on weekends for the independent wrestling circuit. He's adored wherever he goes by fans and young wrestlers who seek his approval. But during week days, when he's outside the ring, he has to deal with the fact he's a loser who works odd jobs at warehouses, goes to strip clubs for some action, is despised by his daughter and still obsesses over his career, as seen by the posters on his trailer, the action figures in his van and '80s Nintendo video game that stars him and which he asks neighborhood kids to play with him, although they'd prefer better video games like Call of Duty 4.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky has crafted a beautiful, depressing, cynically humorous movie about the pitfalls of self-obsession and vainglory. His seamless camera work complements the simple but effective screenplay by Robert D. Siegel, which reveals humanity at every word. Rourke shines as The Ram, a role that no doubt only an actor who once had glory could have played so effectively. When I saw the poster for this movie, with the presumed 'ressurection' of Micky Rourke, I felt like laughing. Now I wish he'll do film lovers a favor and continue giving such performances forever.<br/><br/>Shinging alongside Rourke is Marisa Tomei, an actress who can stay under the radar for years and then comes out of nowhere with a stunning performance. Here she plays Cassidy, a stripper whose real name is Pam when she's not in the club and is busy being a mom. She's Randy's double, an aging stripper who knows she's past her prime; but unlike The Ram, she has plans for the future. Tomei plays her with sensibility and subtlety. Credit should also go to Evan Rachel Wood for her small role as Randy's daughter, Stephanie: she's in some of the most heart-breaking scenes of the movie as she deals with Randy when he decides it's time to connect with the daughter he abandoned a long time ago.<br/><br/>I can't really find faults in this movie, nothing that diminished my enjoyment of it. This is a simple, brilliant little movie, a great drama without being over-dramatic, humorous without being stupid and human without being sentimental. One of my favorites from 2008."

","This film offers unflinching, bare-bones, answers to the puzzle of what happens when a person's fifteen minutes of fame are over. In this instance the person in question is ""Randy the Ram"" (Mickey Rourke) a former wrestling powerhouse back in the Eighties who now ekes out a living on the VFW-hall circuit when he isn't unloading trucks at a grocery store. Randy lives in an America rarely seen on celluloid these days- a nation of trailer parks, strip malls, dollar stores, and grimy community halls.<br/><br/>At first glance he appears scarily close to dereliction: his body is breaking down, he can't pay his rent, but when Randy is in the ring he once again becomes a star. However, it becomes clear that even his wrestling days are numbered and Randy -fearful of what the future holds- attempts to reach out to the daughter he abandoned many years earlier (a wonderful Evan Rachel Wood) and also start a relationship with a guarded exotic dancer who is also nearing the end of her shelf-life (the fantastic Marisa Tomei).<br/><br/>At it's core, ""The Wrestler"" is a depiction of how people try to cling on to hope, dignity, safety, and a sense of connection to others in a world that appears hell-bent on stripping all those things away. The characters portrayed by Rourke and Tomei could so easily be reduced the stereotypes, or even worse played for laughs. Instead both are allowed to be complex, vulnerable and very real human beings that the audience can't help but care for. All of the cast are outstanding but Rourke's performance is truly seismic in it's depth and honesty. His wrestler is a fundamentally gentle, flawed, principled man who is only too aware of his many failings and shortcomings and wishes only that others see the good in him.<br/><br/>At times this can be a hard film to watch. The wrestling scenes skillfully arc between gratuitous brutality and dark humor. Director Darren Aronofsky allows the simple-yet-complicated story unfold at it's own pace. There are no simple answers. The pacing is low-key and the atmosphere is grimy. However the way in which the characters show compassion and allow themselves to falteringly care for one another gives this gem a big, beautiful, tear-stained heart."

This movie has done a lot for wrestling, many people misjudge the sport and use criteria words like fake or boring, The Wrestler sort of portraits the independent wrestling circuit and teaches the viewers that it's harder and more of an involvement sport then what people think. Mickey Rourke let alone gave us a full glimpse and took us into his world. We watch this movie and believe we're Randy The Ram and we believe that we're going through this depression and tough stages. That's how good Mickey Rourke was. Supporting cast was good, Rourke was great and the movie was fondly brilliant."

","I found this to be a most satisfying film. The other positive reviews are spot on. The direction is excellent, Rourke (Ram-Robin), Tomei (Cassidy-Pam) and Wood are terrific.<br/><br/>So I'll try to add some observations you may not have encountered.<br/><br/>Not just in its character definitions but in many other ways, this is a film about aging, about not being able to really go back.<br/><br/>I saw it here in New Jersey where the outside locations for the film were shot. For me, the Garden State plays a supporting role just as the actresses, and does it so well.<br/><br/>Ram and Cassidy meet on a Saturday morning at a second hand shop in Elizabeth. I could be wrong but I think I even know the block it's in and I haven't been to Elizabeth in years. Old clothes to be rediscovered, a metaphor for Ram's life and the relationship with his daughter.<br/><br/>And a secondary theme of surface appearances--Ram as the wrestler, not as Robin, the ordinary guy who works at an Acme (also New Jersey) and hates his real name--meets face to face with Pam, the real Cassidy, who is no longer on stage, but a mother of a nine year old making ends meet by dancing. He's taken aback but still finds her to be beautiful and attractive.<br/><br/>She suggests he track down his daughter. The daughter's home is a quiet, aging small colonial that might have been built in the late 40s or early 50s. No grand entrance, just a simple door. On a street of endless identical aging homes. If this wasn't actually filmed in Linden or Rahway, it could have been.<br/><br/>After he gives his daughter a present for the first-time in years, she agrees to go with Ram to the shore. Down the shore, for New Jerseyans. The location, the aging, abandoned boardwalk of Asbury Park. It's winter when they visit but it will always be winter for Asbury Park. Gone are the rides and food stands and certainly the crowds of lost decades--a striking parallel to Ram's own career. All that remains are the shell of the former Paramount Theater at one end (not shown) and the Casino, the home to all the arcades at the other. It's padlocked, stripped bare and covered with graffiti. They go in and even bust down a door to dance a romantic father-daughter dance to imaginary music in a high-ceilinged room that once hosted skee-ball games and the like. I know. I played them, maybe you did once too.<br/><br/>Yet, they not only can't bring it back, but the daughter can't even remember the casino from her youth. They sit on a window ledge, framed by the interior of the old building, looking out at the sea in a marvelous camera shot.<br/><br/>In a strange universe, I watched the film with about two dozen others on Oscar Sunday afternoon. As Bruce Springsteen sang the theme while the credits rolled, everyone sat quietly, not moving from their seats. When the lights came up I was astonished. The entire audience was 50 or older, as I am, as Rourke is, as those areas of New Jersey are even more so and as wrestling seems to be as a national prime time entertainment.<br/><br/>We all age. If you want a surprising insight into that process, I recommend ""The Wrestler""! (My only quibble is with Tomei's alleged ""aging dancer."" She does it well, very well indeed. But no one could believe the aging part of the description, she's just strikingly beautiful. Or maybe that's because I'm just an older observer.)"

Is there a place for friendship, love, lust, happiness or security... or maybe there is no place for life at all...?

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","0","0","19 February 2009"," Aronofsky and Rourke's realism brings ""Wrestler"" to near-documentary status
","It's hard to remember that ""The Wrestler"" isn't actually about Mickey Rourke. Not only is that testament to the performance that Rourke gives, but to his perfect casting in the part. Someone looking to resurrect his career, Rourke is the best choice for Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson, a former pro-wrestling star whose decides to end his washed up career and find life outside of wrestling. So it's not so coincidental when Randy tells Marissa Tomei's character that ""the 90s sucked."" It couldn't be truer for Rourke. Creator Darren Aronofsky was right to argue for him--this film would have been a footnote in independent film-making with Nicholas Cage in the lead. Instead, ""The Wrestler"" achieves an incredibly life-like, documentary style status that speaks way more to one man's personal journey through the eyes of Rourke.<br/><br/>The film is not so foreign in nature--it's a story about an aging once-famous professional wrestler and how age and reality catches up to him. We've seen this story in other forms, but it takes on a visceral and often times gruesome reality in the form of a pro wrestler. We all come to grips with sacrificing part of what it is we do, but for someone that routinely takes steroids and beats himself up, it's much more extreme and provides a unique visual storytelling opportunity.<br/><br/>Aronofsky (""Requiem for a Dream"") shows that his domain is not just the abstract and doing visually interesting things with a camera. The film's documentary shooting style is so convincing that you often times forget there was a lot of creative energy going into the story. Aronofsky carefully plans how to make his shots not look too carefully planned. It seems pretty simple, but in reality I can't imagine it was easy to ignore the impulse to do certain traditional shots and instead find a way to film the scene in a less Hollywood-like fashion.<br/><br/>Rourke really helps sell the documentary style. His performance is not over-dramatic at all. With the exception of one critical turning point scene in the film, his acting is reserved and completely convincing. You never once see a man trying to be a wrestler, you see a wrestler. It's easy to mistake that kind of performance for being just okay when in reality it's amazing. Rourke will likely never play a better role in his life and it comes just when he needs it.<br/><br/>Supporting actresses Tomei, Randy's stripper love interest, and Evan Rachel Wood, Randy's daughter that he tries to reconnect with, are also strong. Maybe Tomei has finally reached the apex of portraying promiscuous or a-moral characters. I think this role shows that she can hold her own even with her clothes on. Wood (""Across the Universe"") has me convinced that she will be a top actress of her generation. She's just a big role or two away.<br/><br/>""The Wrester"" resonates as a movie exactly about what the title suggests. It's a simple but elegant story of how a wrestler, well, wrestles with retirement and what happens when someone creates an identity like that, that strong of a false persona, and tries to redefine it after twenty-some years. Much like its film-making, ""The Wrester"" is a simple, effective and amazingly realistic film. While Aronofsky didn't get the Oscar credit, his resume certainly would lead anyone to believe that he will get his due if he chooses the right project."

","At first I thought I wouldn't really like this film because wrestling and wrestlers never interested me at all. But I love watching good acting so I gave this film a shot for the sake of Mickey Rourke. I was really surprised and glad that I did give this film a shot! The Wrestler is a film that can completely transport you into the heart and soul of a wrestler if you let it. Mickey Rourke really did such an amazing job. He had me thinking about the character for days. He deserved the Golden Globe and if he does win an Oscar, I wouldn't be surprised at all!

","Darren Aronofsky's latest triumph, The Wrestler, is a poignant tragedy about a man who can only function inside of a wrestling ring and not in the real world. Mickey Rourke portrays 'Randy the Ram' a once was on the wrestling circuit 20 years past and he is still trapped in the 80's. As many have accurately reported, Rourke, gives a tour de force performance that eerily seems to mirror his real life. His acting is top notch, relaxed and unforced. A great example of this is a scene where the Ram is working in a deli counter at an Acme supermarket. Marissa Tomei, who plays Cassidy, a veteran stripper who is re evaluating her life and career choice. Marissa also is making a comeback of sorts like Mickey and she too, plays Cassidy with stark realism and honesty. Not to mention, she does not use a body double in the scenes in the strip club and she looks fantastic. Evan Rachel Wood, rounds out the cast as the Ram's estranged daughter Stephanie. Wood plays Stephanie, who is abandoned by Ram, who is trying to get back into her life with the right degree of hostility but there is a moment where I felt the relationship was not believable, but it was a fleeting moment.<br/><br/>Overall, I absolutely Love this film. I loved the parallel relationship between the Ram and Cassidy, where both are characters in a fantasy world and seeing the Ram ironically, not realizing that and pursues Cassidy strongly, when Cassidy refuses to cross the boundary of dating customers is sad to watch. It is also interesting to see the juxtaposition of the Ram who plays the hero (or the Face) in the ring turns out to be a heel when it comes to his daughter, but still it is hard not to root for him, because he is a nice guy. However, what was the most compelling to me was when the Ram is forced into making a life change working at Acme after suffering a severe heart attack after a particularly grueling match, (which is brutal to watch and expertly filmed by Mr. Aronofsky) in a parallel with his wrestling days, he is seen walking through the back of the supermarket as we slowly hear the build up of a cheering crowd and he stops to pause in front of the (heavy plastic) curtain and when he enters the deli, the noise suddenly comes to a halt. It just makes the tragedy that much clearer.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky continues to shine as one of America's top film makers. The Wrestler, his 4th feature is shot in a gritty, true independent cinema verite style, which feels like we're watching a documentary. I give The Wrestler 5 stars and urge all to go see it. And for you actors out there, you will really appreciate the performances."

","Oddly enough, when I think of professional wrestling, I think of the old slapstick comedies of Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton. A lot of their earliest comedies were hilarious but remarkably violent. But like pro wrestling, it's all staged, right? In the extra features on the DVD of Benny & Joon, in which Johnny Depp does remarkable impersonations of Chaplin, Depp mentions that studying the moves of Chaplin was like going to ""jump school."" The moves they do are not real, the violence isn't real, but the actual physical activity of it all is as real as anything else. Whenever I watch the old Chaplin movies, I always imagine what the rehearsals were like, and that is one of the things about professional wrestling that we see in The Wrestler.<br/><br/>Mickey Rourke gives a powerful and personal performance as the washed up wrestler Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson. Rourke has a turbulent past himself, including a brief stint as a professional boxer and his own fall from stardom and eventual comeback because, like Randy The Ram, this is just what he does. And in Randy's case, it's clear how badly he needs wrestling because he really doesn't know anything else.<br/><br/>The movie opens with a weary Randy resting after a match receiving a disappointing pay from a tiny show. His wrestling superstar past is revealed during the opening credits, and then we meet him as an older man playing small wrestling shows and just trying to make ends meet. He understands that he's nothing like what he used to be, but he also knows that he needs to survive and this is the only way he knows how to do it. He's no longer a tough guy in his 20's or 30's, he's an old guy just going to work, and his body is starting to get tired.<br/><br/>But unlike most sports movies, the wrestling scenes are not meant to serve the purpose of creating excitement or illustrating the sport that the movie is centered around, they are meant to illustrate the reality of the sport that defines the main character's life. We see the nuts and bolts of how an aging wrestler keeps himself in shape enough to get in the ring and make a spectacle of himself. He goes to the hair salon to keep his hair bleached and flowing, he makes complicated transactions with a muscle-bound meathead to get the drugs he needs to stay in what is undeniably incredible physical shape, but he also wears a hearing aid and thick reading glasses.<br/><br/>But his struggles with his aging body and his gradual descent from any kind of wrestling stardom is given meaning by its juxtaposition with his personal life, which involves an estranged daughter and a curious relationship with an exotic dancer at a local strip club, in whom he clearly has a unique interest. Randy discovers that he has lived the life of a wrestling superstar and has finished without so much as a significant other or a daughter who wants anything to do with him. He has lived a lifetime of mistakes and the physical toll that his profession takes on him makes him finally realize that he needs to reexamine his life and re-prioritize.<br/><br/>The performance by Evan Rachel Wood, I have to say, is remarkably bad. She has an emotional scene late in the film that reminds me of something I would expect to see in a high school play, but the relationship between Cassidy (the stripper played remarkably by Marisa Tomei) and Randy and the parallel nature of their lives give the film a depth that it would not otherwise have reached. Essentially they play exactly the same role in life. He is an aging wrestler who's income depends on the peakness of his physique, and she is a stripper who's income also depends on the peakness of her physique. Both of them are reaching a point in their lives where they have to do something totally different, and neither of them has any idea where to begin.<br/><br/>But the best thing that the movie does is that it humanizes those towering masses of raging muscle that we see in the ring in professional wrestling shows. Personally I am absolutely mystified as to the attraction of such nonsense, but like anyone in show business, from strippers to wrestlers to actors, when the show stops they become people like the rest of us.<br/><br/>Evan Rachel Wood, who plays Randy's daughter in the movie, is also dating Marilyn Manson, who has to be one of the freakiest guys ever to get in front of a camera or microphone, although he defined one of the central messages of the movie when he once said, ""You know, it you take away all the costumes and scary make-up, we're just a bunch of regular guys."""

","I saw The Wrestler just after viewing Doubt, within about a week. I think what we have here are two ends of the spectrum, the non-action film vs. the action film, and I credit the Academy for recognizing both. It is nice to think, even trust, that Academy members have a broad view of what might be considered exceptional films. What the two films have in common is noteworthy acting. Give the edge to ""The Wrestler"", and I'll tell you why.<br/><br/>This is one heckuva piece of work, in every way films are measured. Mickey Rourke, as Randy the Ram, is totally believable as a fading wrestling star. Right from the beginning we see that his is not the life of a successful sports star. His painfully sad existence is evinced in scene after exhausting scene, sometimes with the people he has accumulated along the way as associates, and sometimes just as the camera trails along with him. And along the way we get a good feel for ins and outs of the gritty world of professional wrestling.<br/><br/>His colleagues in this effort all do great work (Marisa Tomei's strong performance is eclipsed by her knockout topless scenes - there aren't many +40 year old actresses that look THAT good) and lend an air of authenticity to the people with whom with he associates. There is only one over-the-top scene (overacting) in the film, that involving Randy's daughter (Evan Rachel Wood). Wood is good at all other moments.<br/><br/>There are really nice, even memorable, touches in this film. Some of the wrestling scenes are quite amazing; how do they not get hurt? Randy the Ram's fellow athletes and promoters lend authenticity throughout. Even the opening tableau of playbills, ticket stubs and photos from the Ram's past is smart stuff.<br/><br/>Rourke's physical demeanor alone is fascinating to study; you really can't take your eyes off him. It is hard to imagine another actor extant that could have performed this role as well. While the ending may not play well with some, I am not sure it could have been done any other way, successfully. But that is why you should see it; decide for yourself if this the logical ending for what is not at all just another sports film.<br/><br/>I give this film 3-1/2 stars."
"griffolyon12","7","0","0","15 February 2009"," This is Mickey Rourke's Film!
","The Wrestler is a film about an aging professional wrestler who is having to come to grips with his own mortality. I saw it just the other night, and while I was blown away by certain aspects of it, others just left me a tad dissatisfied.<br/><br/>The Wrestler is the latest film from visionary director Darren Arronofsky, but this time around Arronofsky has taken a far more simpler approach to directing and has shifted away from the visuals and rather towards the acting. While I was slightly disappointed in Arronofsky's direction, simply because he seems to be refusing who he truly is as a filmmaker in this film, he does manage to generate terrific performances from his actors; in particular Mickey Rourke's Oscar worthy performance as Randy ""the Ram"" Robinson. While Arronofsky's direction left me with a little more to be desired, the script by Robert Siegel was superb, as well the 16 mm cinematography was beautifully utilized throughout.<br/><br/>Overall the Wrestler was a good character study, but without Mickey Rourke this film would have been a forgettable experience. This film truly is Rourkes and no one else's. While I am a tad more critical of the direction mainly because I am such a big fan of Arronofsky's previous works, there is still no denying that the direction fit the story and its style, even if it was not as visually stimulating as an Arronofsky fan could have hoped. In the end the Wrestler was a film that I enjoyed, but the story's depressing nature and overall brutality keeps it from being a film that you will want to watch more than once.<br/><br/>I give the Wrestler a good 7 out of 10!"

","The script is ambitious. What does the body mean? It means a lot to a wrestler and a stripper, but when the body gets older, is there any life left? Or is death to be preferred? Immediately or later on? Perhaps that's a question everyone has to put to them themselves.<br/><br/>So these questions are put also here, but anyway it's very simplified. If it wasn't for the tremendous acting, the movie wouldn't mean much.<br/><br/>Mickey Rourke deserves all the applause he has got, but Marisa Tomei is his equal, making a very distinguished portrait and catalyst out of her stripper part. But perhaps the best actor of them all is Evan Rachel Wood as the wrestler's daughter. There is a final scene between them with very profound emotions. It's the strongest part of the movie."

Mickey literally brings to life the once famous and now destitute broken down wrestler who is always struggling to reach to the top. It is Darren Afaranosky's skill that he shows us Randy with all his flaws and shortcomings. It is made clear that Randy is this today because of his own faults. Marisa Tomei does a commendable job as Cassidy even though this film is completely dominated by Rourke.Evan Rachel Wood is effective in her short but important role of Randy's daughter.The wrestling scenes are terrific. The fight which sends Randy to the hospital is brutally effective as it makes the user wince seeing the two fighters pummel each other with barb wire, staple pins, nails and steel chairs. One of the best scenes is when Randy tries in vain to reconcile with his daughter.Thats really heartbreaking.Same is the scene where former wrestlers have to sit on the counter to sell their memorabilia. The climax fight, that is the re match with Ayatollah is a fitting ending to the film which is a saga of a man trying to redeem himself and regain his former glory.The last shot simply blew me away.<br/><br/>The only performance which can compare to this will be Sean Penn's in Milk. It will be a close contest between the two but judging the situation, one feels that Mickey Rourke is this years winner for the best actor."

","Darren Aronofsky's The Wrestler marks his fourth full-length feature film. With Mickey Rourke to reprise the role of Randy 'The Ram' Robinson, a aged wrestler who is picking up the glory back again, The Wrestler has become one of the best film made in 2008.<br/><br/>Aronofsky has been well-known for bringing surprises to the audience in his previous works, with Requiem for a Dream (2000) bagging several awards for his shock factors in the drama on the disaster due to over indulgence in drugs, sex and slimming pills. Today, The Wrestler will make audience see how a man brings back the glory he enjoyed 20 years ago thru violence, failed relationships and doing something he had never done before.<br/><br/>Randy (Rourke) is a former wrestler who now teaches wrestling to school kids and in neighborhood areas. Once a famous wrestler, he no longer enjoyed much fame he had compared to 20 years ago. Occasionally making appearances in wrestling match, Randy suffers a heart attack which could have left him dead if he goes wrestling for another round.<br/><br/>Thus, he decided to do something he has never done before. First, falling in love with a aged stripper Cassidy (Marisa Tomei in her most daring role ever). Second, to patch up his estranged relationship with his lesbian daughter, Stephanie (Evan Rachel Woods). Working as a supermarket worker in the delicatessen department as odd jobs, Randy wants to get back his pride that he has lost. When both relationships doesn't work out well, he decided to go back to wrestling, even though he knows he is taking the risk of playing a game with death for the second time.<br/><br/>The Wrestler is a story on a fall of a man from his glorious times, and how he wanted to get back the pride he enjoys formally. Emotional struggles were presented in endless wrestling matches, frequent visits to strip club and unable to communicate with colleagues at work. These are some ways on how Aronofsky want to tell how a old wrestler who finds comfort in expressing his emotions, thru acts and habits he is familiar with.<br/><br/>One shouldn't expect Aronofsky to tell the story in a very smoothing and pleasurable way, which is healthy for the eyes and the mind. Expect a fair amount of violence and sex in The Wrestler. Violence is something a professional wrestler will feel alright with, which is sad to say, a part of his job. The scene on Randy having a match with his opponent at a surrounding filled with shattered glass, barb wires, stapler and razors serves as a thrill for the fans, at the expense of their health and body.<br/><br/>Randy's romance with Cassidy shows that he do not mind his lover's profession in a sleazy club which the main purpose is to service and satisfy man's most basic needs. It is sad to see that when a wrestler makes a living out of his body, he is falling in love with someone who is making a living out of displaying her body. Sad, but true. If anyone is looking for a very simple boy meets girl dating movie, The Wrestler will not be your choice.<br/><br/>From their heydays to making lists of B-movies, Rourke and Tomei are making a comeback in The Wrestler. Rourke, famous for his classic performances in Adrian Lyne's 9 1/2 Weeks in 1986, is making a comeback in The Wrestler. With his experience in acting in B-listed movies for more than a decade, Rourke's experience has been put to a good use by Aronofsky. Using only 35 days to complete the shooting of The Wrestler, Rourke do not need much practice in playing a role of a wrestler getting back his glory. He is putting life into the story, which has truly gained him a Golden Globe Awards 2009 for Best Actor.<br/><br/>Marisa Tomei makes a breakthrough as Cassidy, an aged stripped. It is not a wonder that many feels that being a B-listed actress, she appears naked in a role that serves as a sex object to the public. However, it is rare for such roles to gain a recognition by the juries of the Academy Awards, and Tomei has proved that she can do it.<br/><br/>It is not easy to watch The Wrestler if one is simply looking for the thrill they want in a wrestling match. Yes, you got the action, the violence and the gore. But it was the sweat, tears, years of loneliness and struggle that makes The Wrestler the recipient of Golden Lion Awards in 2008 Venice Film Festival.<br/><br/>One do not need to watch any wrestling competition to watch this independent movie. Knowing the emotions and struggles is more important than knowing the wrestling skills to watch the wrestling match in life."

","First off, I'd like to say that this is a good film. Not great, but well above average. Mickey Rourke gives, not the best performance of his career, but a damn fine rendition of an aged pro wrestler struggling to deal with both the perils of the inevitable aging process and the consequences of a lifetime spent on the road with what basically amounts to a traveling circus.<br/><br/>All of the performances are what make this film stand out from the pack. Especially those of Rourke, Marisa Tomei, and Evan Rachel Wood although I must admit not liking Wood's character too much. She's a perfect example of our politically correct world where people expect perfection out of everyone around them, especially their parents.<br/><br/>Now, while I liked this film overall, it made me pine for the days of Pi, director Aronofsky's first and still most impressive film. Unfortunately, Aronofsky seems to be one of those directors who spend their entire career taking the slow path down the big hill. Each one of his films has been slightly less impressive than it's predecessor. I only hope that 15 years from now Darren Aronofsky (who started out in my eyes as one of the new directors to keep an eye on) isn't making teen comedies or sappy melodramas on television.<br/><br/>If this film had been cast with less talented actors it probably would have slipped completely under the radar, but with such powerful performances (again, primarily from Mickey Rourke and Marisa Tomei) it is a prime example of the possibility of making a good movie with a fraction of a typical Hollywood budget."

","Let me make it clear right at the beginning that if you are looking for something like ""Raging Bull"" here then forget it. The story line is quiet predictable & the movie throws out parallel stories just to show how miserable the protagonist's (Randy's)life is. Coming from somebody like Darren Aronofsky, its a bit of a letdown. <br/><br/>Mickey Rourke plays a professional wrestler who is presently in his forties & not any more the star performer he used to be in his youth. He even struggles to pay the rent for his house. He is all alone in his life & is looking for means to get over his loneliness. In a bid to do this, he visits strip clubs & tries to patch-up with his daughter whom he had abandoned in her childhood.He has a thing for a stripper & wants her to be a part of his life but she can't as she has her personal set of problems. <br/><br/>Now, reading all this, you can understand how pitiable Randy's life is. In fact, the story looks contrived when the director tries to throw up incidents just to arouse sympathy for Randy. But, despite its flaws, the story works primarily because the characters are so flesh & blood. You would particularly enjoy those scenes in which wrestlers discuss the moves they are going to make on each other. For all the WrestleMania lovers, its a treat. <br/><br/>Now something has to be said about Mickey Rourke who plays Randy with such aplomb. The kind of physical training he must have gone through to prepare for this role is truly appreciable. He is especially vulnerable in those scenes with his daughter & the stripper. The movie doesn't drag itself but the ending looks abrupt. All the other actors have performed competently. Technically, the film is quiet sound especially when they portray the bloody battles. <br/><br/>All in all, an average fair but watch it for Mickey's performance & if you want an inside look into wrestling federations."

","Mickey Rourke is an actor with an interesting profile in that he started out as a golden boy, then went into a spiral of extreme self destruction, but came out of it without actually destroying himself, to be reinvented as a rather better actor than he was in the first place. The only trouble is that the self destructive phase has left him with facial problems - structure and mobility. This didn't matter too much in Sin City, where prosthetics concealed the structural issues and, in The Wrestler, it can be taken to indicate the damage this man has had inflicted on him on the course of a long - too long - wrestling career. The lack of mobility is something of a problem, and means that Rourke's performance necessarily comes from his eyes, voice and body language.<br/><br/>It is a very good performance, and merits the praise it has garnered. Marisa Tomei is also excellent in a courageous performance as a faded stripper - she still looks good, but for how much longer? I was, perhaps, more concerned about the story. I am a fairly shallow person, and I wasn't looking for subtext, so I saw this as a relatively simple tragedy. Randy's career, such as it is, is cut short by a heart attack so he determinedly changes track, proving to have an aptitude for a job he previously wouldn't have considered, rebuilding bridges in the damaged relationship with his daughter, and working towards a relationship with Tomei's stripper Cassidy. It is Cassidy's hasty and ill-considered rejection which leads to him missing dinner with his daughter through being drunk, which finally destroys any chance at reconciliation, as a result of which he goes back into the ring with inevitable results. It is a small, unhappy story which celebrates nothing, which is why I find it difficult to celebrate this film despite its undoubted merits.<br/><br/>A couple of other things I didn't like much: Rourke is the noisiest breather in the history of movies, and there was too much - far too much - of hand-held cameras following people around (Rourke leads us on a complete tour of the supermarket building where he works at one point).<br/><br/>I'm glad I saw it, I'm not keen to watch it again."

","Few films that have been made in recent years pack the emotional punch The Wrestler brings. Darren Aronofsky's deft direction assures that the emotion never feels strained, and that nearly every moment rings true. The maturity he shows in letting the actors take the center stage is surprising considering this is only his fourth film. The centerpieces of this film, though, are Mickey Rourke and Marisa Tomei, both of whom give brutally honest portrayals of two people hanging onto their dreams by a thread. Rourke delivers each line with such conviction that you soon forget he is playing a fictional character. You can see the hurt in his eyes as he is likely recalling his own tumultuous career. Not for one second does his performance ring false, and for that, he deserves the highest of praise. Tomei is very understated in a role that could have easily fallen to tired clich√©s, but she digs beneath Pam's good looks to find the fear she feels as she begins to enter a new phase in her life. The film has its problems; I wish it was about 10-20 minutes longer because I wanted to spend more time with Randy and Pam, and a few scenes feel slightly out of place, I call to mind the exchange between Randy and his daughter at the pier. Overall, The Wrestler is so much more than a sports film, it is an emotionally wrenching look at a man who doesn't know how to put the pieces of his life back together."

","It's hard to tell whether this movie is either an expose of the fickle, flash-in-the-pan realities of professional wrestling or purely a character study. One this is for certain though: Mickey Rourke will never be better cast. His performance as Randy The Ram seems almost too real...as if Rourke is aware of the quasi-autobiographical nature of the character he's playing. His performance is low-key, understated, and startlingly effective as a gentle has-been wrestler who is a good man mired with serious problems. Marisa Tomei, who plays an aging stripper who serves as something of a female counterpart to Rourke's aging wrestler, also does a great job.<br/><br/>This movie teaches the well-told but valuable lesson that good looks, fame and fortune are all fleeting, and if you're fortunate enough to hit it big, you'd do well to make the most out of your time in the sun. Wrestling gave Randy everything he had...and it took everything away from him as well because he wasn't smart about his life, leaving him a broken-down shell of what he was with no family, no money and no real future. Yet Rourke performance makes you root for him, despite his character's miscues.<br/><br/>Rourke and Tomei's performances carry this movie, which as stated above, is a standard fame-is-fleeting story. Overall though, this movie is a solid lesson about the harsh realities of glory."

","The wrestling industry can launch soaring careers and it may destroy careers in a heartbeat. As a lifelong fan of the business, I would watch taped television shows as a kid, falling in love with the various characters on the card. You would see a new personality and tell all your friends that you wanted to get their official merchandise gear as Christmas presents. A few days, weeks, months, later that wrestler had disappeared from the broadcasts, without a single mention thenceforth from the colour commentators. When you are younger the only answer is that the wrestler had time off to heal injuries. Now, with the Internet revolution that has grown and grown since the 1997 Madison Square Garden Incident, no sacking of workers happens behind closed doors. There are many websites working every day to bring fans the latest news on backstage gossip, and frequently report with the wrestler's needs at heart. Darren Aronofsky's ""The Wrestler"" restrains from telling the viewer that the workers in this sports entertainment have no union. In a utopian world the draws would pick up the same wage as the other members, but this is all a preternatural proposition.<br/><br/>Randy 'The Ram' Robinson (Mickey Rourke) is one such casualty of the miniscule benefits available for wrestler protection. He is first seen seated in the corner of a locker room, with his back to the camera, sighing. When a bookie enters his personal space with the money for the night's work, Randy tosses it aside. It was a lesser amount than he had been expecting, but any income must seem underwhelming in comparison to his glory days, impressibly explored by Aronofsky's opening segment, in which he pans through an array of promotional material, newspaper articles, flyers, journals and gate receipts - all plugging the talent of Randy in his prime. A title card appears after this introduction, and the Randy we are meeting is now twenty years removed from his prime. We imagine, thus, how many wrestlers Randy had to trample over in order to rise to the top of the card and be the number one headliner in the game. These days he is still main event material at events, although the duel for the strap has less lustre on the independent scene.<br/><br/>""The Wrestler"" poses a number of questions, and the most startling is the admission that Randy is no longer a good wrestler. Maybe he still is a good wrestler, actually, for that is Mickey Rourke doing all his own stunts. He is still in great shape and notice the complexity of some wrestling spots he partakes. Normally it is the more athletic and nimble opponent who takes all the bumps, but Randy dives past the ropes and onto the canvas floor, he climbs the turnbuckle and sells his version of the diving headbutt to the crowd. He can still entertain a crowd, and can garner pops within the match that are as noisy as the response his entrance music merits. In any business, a new generation comes along and Randy, even if he could keep up physically, got a little out of touch with the majority of popular culture. He tells the strip club worker whom he befriends (Marisa Tomei) the nineties sucked, singling out Nirvana as a perfect synopsis of this period's woes, and instead of playing computer games online, Randy asks one of his neighbourhood kids to play Nintendo with him. The original Nintendo console that is, with the wrestling gameplay detectable in its primitiveness.<br/><br/>Read the full review:<br/><br/>http://www.sightforallseasons.co.nr/"

","SPOILER ALERT: Another exercise in unrelenting bleakness from Darren Aronofsky this time buoyed by a ferocious Mickey Rourke performance. Rourke is Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson, a pro-wrestler WAY past his prime. He makes a comeback in neither his personal nor professional life --- this isn't ROCKY! Draw your own conclusions what the final shot of the film means. Aronofsky and scriptwriter Robert Siegel pull no punches and never hit a sentimental note even during what should be sentimental scenes, particularly involving Rourke and his estranged daughter, played by Evan Rachel Wood (finally living up to the potential she showed in THIRTEEN). There are moments of uncomfortable humor mixed into the squalor (Rourke taking a job as a deli clerk is particularly bizarre). Marisa Tomei is the film's love interest (maybe anti-love interest is more appropriate). She's a stripper with a lot of her own baggage. All of the acting is excellent and Rourke gives one of those astonishing performances (like Brando in ON THE WATERFRONT and Meryl Streep in SOPHIE'S CHOICE) that will go down in history."

","Mickey Rourke is, indeed, as terrific as advertised and his performance is worth the price of admission.

The film's first two-thirds is wonderful, and while watching it, I'm thinking that this film is going to be a major work to be remembered decades from now. The trouble is, the plot points that drive the latter third, divided between the relationship with his estranged daughter as well as the relationship with a stripper friend are handled so tritely that I can only figure that the writer didn't know what to do after he came up with the premise for the story.

"ftyl","8","0","0","1 February 2009"," Reality cannot be wrestled with
","The Wrestler is without a doubt Darren Arronovskys most straightforward films to date and proves that he has the talent to handle a wide range of genres and styles, a skill which David Fincher may not have in light of his uneven Benjamin Button. Here, Mickey Rourke plays an aging professional wrestler who is lost in some no man's land between his 80's hey day and the realities of his bruised and broken 21st century self. After a brutal bout, The Ram's body betrays him and he ends up alone and battered by life, trying to recover from a heart attack. Unable to compete in the ring and alienated from everyone around him, he reaches out to a sympathetic stripper (Marisa Tomei) and makes a last attempt to connect with his estranged daughter (Evan Rachel Wood). The Ram is approached for a high profile rematch with a former foe and he must choose between a potentially fatal return to the ring and the tiny, nascent possibility of a real life which he has carved out for himself.<br/><br/>Much has been made of the parallels between Rourke and The Ram but making that connection takes away from the sterling work by Rourke. He inhabits the character totally ¬ñ no doubt helped by his increasingly bizarre features (he underwent reconstructive surgery after a short lived boxing career) but also bringing a strange na√Øve sweetness to a difficult role. For The Ram, it is life outside of the ring that is hard, the everyday is not subject to the rules and controls which exist in a wrestling match. And, most telling of all, you always know who is going to win in a wrestling match ¬ñ in real life it is never certain. Even when Randy's life is going well, there is always a sense of fatalism, the sense that he cannot allow himself to succeed because he is too afraid of not knowing what will happen next.<br/><br/>Alongside Rourke, Tomei gives a good performance, although she is far too attractive for the role of a forgotten stripper. Seeing the two of them together comes across as aspirational rather than real, an anomaly in an otherwise naturalistic film. Likewise, Rourke's relationship with his daughter, though heartfelt, is spiked with too much clich√© to be truly engaging. She is the hate-filled daughter who grew up without a father while he plays the immature, absentee dad who lost his way in a multitude of character flaws. These elements weaken the film to some extent but are generally forgivable ¬ñ especially in light of the fact that Wood features in some of Rourke's strongest scenes and she holds her own very well for such a young actor.<br/><br/>One of The Wrestler's greatest assets is its camera-work by Maryse Alberti. Fluid and almost documentary style, it also manages to be a commentary on theme and character. Often when Rourke is walking to a new location, the camera follows close behind, hand-held. This deliberately apes that oft-used shot of a fighter on the way to the ring, enhanced by the claustrophobic corridors he walks down, mirroring those underneath a stadium. This connection is made literal as Rourke walks in one long take to the deli counter, with crowd noises on the soundtrack. Rourke literally treats every moment as though he were on the way to the ring, and this is another subtle indication of his inherent immaturity and fear of reality. When faced with another life, he retreats ¬ñ even going so far as working in the same dead end job for fear of being forced to grow up. Rourke's man child is pathetic, selfish and broken but in the ring he is loved, adored and lauded for not growing up. It is an escape for the character and not fundamentally different from the many ways in which we all escape from responsibility and the vicissitudes of reality.<br/><br/>The Wrestler is a strong and simple film about a deeply flawed and powerfully sympathetic character. Rourke's performance is mesmerizing and his envelopment in the character complete. As the film ends and Bruce Springsteen's 'The Wrestler' plays over the credits we cant help but wish that things could have worked out better for The Ram but the fact is, outside of the ring, no one ever knows who is going to win."

","The film begins with headlines of a star studded defeat over the ayatollah. A dead give away to whats ahead for our world. The name of the main character is Ram. A Ram, in Abrahamic tradition, which closely resembles the name of the director of The Wrestler, represents a sacrificial animal. Well as we all know pro wrestlers put themselves through many serious sacrifices: family, pain, drugs, etc.- which amounts to the filler in the film. Filler is done to keep all the castrated sheep from asking to many questions about the political undertones in films. Moving on to the end. We see a broken down Ram deciding to forgo the beautiful and hot marissa tomei to take on the iranian ayatollah. Who is actually an African American wrestler, the cat, from the WCW wrestling organization, once owned by Ted Turner who created such great wrestling teams as the NWO and the Wolfpack- awesome! With Ram's last bit of energy he sinks a big elbow into the side of Iran. This reflects the mentality of many Americans who will give up the sweeter things in life to go ahead and fight Iran/iraq, even though they are weak and tired. In addition to the mental anguish we Americans have been put through. It also says that we as a country our weak right now. Its true, America is weak and we don't have it all together to take on Iran, with its Russian made sunburn missiles, that will turn any ship in the American naval fleet into light.

","I first remember Mickey Rourke as the suave lover in ""Nine 1/2 Weeks"" (1986) but his career has since bombed big time and, a couple of decades later, as the eponymous sports figure he's almost unrecognizable as a beefed-up but worn-out has-been not unlike the man in real life. Yet he utterly inhabits this role as Randy 'The Ram' Robinson in an outstanding portrayal. As for supporting star Marisa Tomei, I first recall her in ""My Cousin Vinny"" (1992) where she was terrific and showed a promise that has never really been realised, before appearing here in a brave role where she appears almost naked as Cassidy, the archetypal tart with a heart. She is by turns sexy and sweet in a wonderfully engaging performance.<br/><br/>Directed and produced by Darren Aronofsky, this is a movie which might initially be thought of as simply ""Rocky"" for wrestlers and it does play to some of the same themes, but ultimately we're given something different, something a little less traditional and more honest."

I thought all the actors did a great job and was happy with the way their stories turned out. This isn't that living happily ever after, this was a real life believable story, and I was content with this. I found the final scene captivating, I took off my hat and leaned in to capture every aspect of the final moments of the match. <br/><br/>Spoilers The ending caught me off guard in a few ways. When the daughter hated him again I was surprised to not see the story line finished but I felt this was for the best, I also appreciated when Cassidy came back at the end to apologize as well. I didn't mind not seeing the end of the match. I kinda liked not knowing what happened after he flew off screen. However one change instead of the quick audio cut out, there should have been an audio fade out.

","Firstly,I can say that Rourke's performance wasn't perfect at all.He is good;but not the very one for Academy Award.Film's biggest problem is trying to tell a very intensified story;but while doing this failing to give deepness to the characters.In my opinion,in this movie perfectly drawn character is stripteaser Cassidy,because director really shows her dilemmas about Ram and makes her both a mother and a very opposite character,a stripteaser.She wants to be a mother who really wants to care her son,but her work blocks it.Tomei's performance is really significant.Actually character deepness problem is solved in the last scenes by slowing the story down.Still Stephanie stays as the biggest deficiency of movie.She's pale,far from reality,undependable.She firstly hates her father,suddenly she becomes happy with his father's present and after this she hates from her father because her father doesn't come to the date he promised to come.I think all these mistakes made Stephanie the weakest ring of the movie.Also there's not something we can name as creative in the movie,everything was ordinary and typical.I'm sorry but i can't say that this movie was the one i really expected."

","Before this movie came out, it was hard to believe that Mickey Rourke was once hailed as ""the new Brando."" With ""The Wrestler"" it looks like he's finally made good on the early promise he showed as an actor back in the 80s.<br/><br/>He plays Randy The Ram, a wrestler whose best days are long gone. He tells his daughter he's ""a broken down piece of meat."" (a line that echoes Brando's desperation of ""I coulda been a contender"" in ""On The Waterfront."") With his tight facelift, gravelly voice and blonde bimbo hair, he looks like Charles Bronson in drag, but he's in great shape for a man of his age.<br/><br/>The film has strong echoes of the first ""Rocky"" movie. Both movies concern down-on-their-luck fighters struggling to make ends meet who get one last shot at the big time. Both films have a downbeat, documentary, slice-of-life style (like Rourke, Stallone was also hailed as ""the new Brando"" by critics after the first ""Rocky"" movie). Rourke's ""Adrian"" is played by Marisa Tomei. She plays a stripper having an on-off relationship with Randy. It's a surprise to see the hot little body that Marisa's got in this (although her face has gone so thin that she looks like she needs a good meal). If anything, Randy the Ram is an even more sympathetic character than Stallone's character in ""Rocky."" He's older, sicker and virtually alone in the world.<br/><br/>Both Rourke and Tomei have connections with Sylvester Stallone. Rourke starred with Stallone in ""Get Carter"" and Tomei played Sly's daughter in ""Oscar."" Casting coincidence? I think not. The makers of this film know their movie history and they knew exactly what they were trying to do.<br/><br/>The script is terrific. It never loses focus on either its themes or its characters. It gives the audience a forensic look inside the world of wrestling (if you doubted wrestling was a fix, it's made crystal clear here). From the endemic steroid abuse to applying fake tan, visits to the hairdresser and the injuries sustained in the matches themselves, we get a warts-and-all tour through Randy's oddball, gladiatorial existence. The bouts in the ring are an affectionate parody of the WWE that we're all so familiar with (indeed, Rourke has apparently been approached by the WWE to take part in the next Wrestlemania. Life is imitating art already!).<br/><br/>If there was one thing I didn't like about this film, it's the inconclusive ending. I don't know if they're leaving it open for a sequel or if you're just supposed to make your mind up about whether Rourke's character survives or not. Either way, it feels like a bit of a cheat. They could have easily wrapped the whole thing up with one final scene.<br/><br/>Apart from that, this was first-rate entertainment all the way. If Mickey Rourke wins the Oscar, I don't think anyone would begrudge him his win. He's stepped on a lot of toes in Hollywood, but he's paid the price with years in the wilderness (anyone who remembers his bit-part performance as a transvestite convict in ""The Animal Factory"" (2000) will know that). A few years back when he was starting his comeback, he said that he hoped a director would give him a chance as he would ""come through like a motherf***er for him."" I think he's just done that. Well done, Mickey."
"OldAle1","8","0","0","27 January 2009"," Rourke's redemption? Aronofsky coming down to earth? Yes to both, and mostly for the best.
","Randy the Ram's glory days were in the mid-80s, as the cheesy graphics in the opening credits remind us, the camera panning over old pictures and tear-sheets advertising his matches. Randy's a professional wrestler, an entertainer whose body is his business, as we're reminded over and over, sometimes subtly but most of the time fairly bluntly in this very heartfelt film about his life and potential redemption. And by extension, that of the former big star who plays Randy, Mickey Rourke.<br/><br/>This is Rourke's film through and through and in a year with a great many very fine male lead performances - Sean Penn in ""Milk"" and Clint Eastwood in ""Gran Torino"" both managed all-time-great work - this might be the best. Rourke inhabits this role like a second skin, a bruised and bloodied steroid-enhanced skin with a mind under it that is active enough but still delusional, still the video-game-playing headbanging kid of the 70s and 80s despite the adult responsibilities that he just doesn't want to face. He's too old for this world, as a heart attack early on tells him; but he's also not fit for the ""straight"" life of working in a grocery store and being a father either.<br/><br/>Shot in Super 16 with a low-budget grungy vibe throughout, ""The Wrestler"" doesn't really do anything new apart from being (apparently) the first Hollywood drama about professional wrestling; you could slap most of the well-worn clich√©s here into most films about boxing, drag racing, etc and they'd be right at home. And a lot of the subtext is pretty obvious too; when Randy falls for a stripper (Marisa Tomei who must have made a pact with the devil to look the way she does at 44) we can see pretty readily that, unspoken or not, the themes of performance vs real life, acting a part and knowing when to stop acting, responsibility in the midst of still playing the childhood dream of being the macho guy or the gorgeous babe are going to reflect equally on both stars. And Randy's attempted reconciliation with his daughter (Evan Rachel Wood) is similarly predictable, though the scene where they go to the deserted and decrepit seaside town is pretty moving anyway.<br/><br/>I really didn't like Darren Aronofsky's previous film, ""The Fountain"" at all: pretentious, pretty for the sake of being pretty, full of grandiose ideas never really developed. ""The Wrestler"" is no question an attempt to take the opposite tack, and some people are calling it pretentious for the very reason that the director is trying something different! A ludicrous criticism if you ask me, and this film has a lot in common with both the gritty street scenes of his first two films (""Pi"" and ""Requiem for a Dream"") and the overt redemptive story lines of ""Requiem"". It doesn't reach as far or as wide as any of his previous work, but in a great many respects it succeeds more fully in what it does attempt.<br/><br/>So you don't go into this for originality, you go into it for great acting and verisimilitude in the decaying Jersey atmosphere, and it succeeds phenomenally in those regards. The ending will disappoint some who want easy resolutions, but if it does they weren't paying attention; there are no easy answers here, and the choice of Bruce Springsteen to sing the title song at the end ought to make that much clear. Life is hard; all Randy can do, finally, is narrow it down to the one thing he loves that never let him down, whether it kills him or not, and all we can do is savor the moment."

","The year may have just begun, but I am going to put my neck out and say that I may have already seen the best 09' has to offer. The best films are the one's where you sit watching and you genuinely care what is going to happen to the people in the film. You feel like you are looking at events in at the life of someone you know or are rooting for. The Wrestler is one of those movies. Quite simply, it is a touching, phenomenal look at a very troubled life. Non-wrestling fans DO NOT be put off, this is a movie everyone should see. Randy ''The Ram'' Robinson had it all as a wrestler in the 80's. He was at the very pinnacle of sports entertainment and was adored by wrestling fans world wide. The start of the movie outlines this with some of the highlights of Randy's career shown in magazine cut outs and photos. One of the aspects I enjoyed most about the movie was the way it portrayed the sport of wrestling. What annoys me is that a lot of people consider wrestling just to be costumes and 'fake' punches, but it's a lot more than that, and I hope after seeing this movie you'll agree. The present day, is a different story for The Ram. Twenty years later, and Randy is working in the Independent Wrestling World, with no money, relationship problems, a drug habit, and he has just been evicted from his trailer. Mickey Rourke, who is known to have his own troubled life, was probably made for this role, and his performance is dare say Oscar worthy. The film at times is like watching a real life documentary; such is the scale of the performance from Rourke. The toughest battle in the life of Robinson is one more severe than anything he has ever faced in the ring, his attempt at reconciling with his daughter. So after a near fatal heart attack, with the help of single mother/stripper Cassidy (Marissa Tomei), Randy bids to win back the trust of Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood), who has shut her father out of her life. The Wrestler was made with a small budget, but with a very big heart. Touching story, terrific performances, it's a movie you'll be happy to have a rematch with again and again."

"stryker1121","Null","0","0","27 January 2009"," Aronofsky, Rourke serve a brooding meal that's not for everyone
","The Wrestler is a hard movie to watch. A patina of doom and desperation shellacs every scene in this story about washed out, sad eyed professional wrestler Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson. <br/><br/>This is no uplifting Rocky-like tale. Nor does it follow the rise-fall-redemption template of the recent spate of musician biopics. The Wrestler is about a man who's hit bottom only to discover there's nowhere else to go but down. Watching that negative trajectory play out on screen is an exceedingly uncomfortable experience. <br/><br/>Part of that discomfort stems from Darren Aronofsky's directing style. Several scenes resemble a documentary with a hand-held camera shakily following a shambling Mickey Rourke around the New Jersey hinterlands as he readies himself for a match. The bouts are held not in the packed arenas of The Ram's 1980s heyday, but in the bingo halls and high school gyms of the low-paying indie circuit. <br/><br/>The wrestling action is intimately filmed; the camera tightens around the two performers as they wince from the real pain of pulled punches and chairs to the head. An ECW-style hardcore match is especially difficult to watch. Here, Aronofsky unflinchingly shoots The Ram and his opponent brutalizing each other with lamps, thumbtacks and barbed wire. He then shows us the cringe-inducing backstage aftermath of medics removing glass shards from the combatants' scarred, blood-covered bodies. The latter is something you will not see during the average episode of Monday Night Raw. <br/><br/>What's especially sad is that The Ram takes these beatings for essentially chump change, and must rely on a concoction of prescription pain medications to push him to his next minuscule payday. Memories of past glories keep him going, as does the reverence of younger wrestlers and the adoration from the rabidly vocal group of fans who attend his small-scale shows. Ultimately, however, he keeps wrestling because there's nothing else he knows how to do. <br/><br/>The punishment Aronofsky heaps upon The Ram is not just physical. The former star lives at the poverty level in a trailer pathetically decorated with newspaper clippings of his heroic past. His relationships with other people, meanwhile, are tangential at best: <br/><br/>During the week he works at a grocery store, where his mean-spirited jerk of a boss humiliates him with cheap jokes. He spends much of his money on a hot-but-aging stripper, played by the still very gorgeous Marisa Tomei. Nor does he have a relationship with his teenage daughter, whom he deserted long ago. All of this adds up to a lonely, beaten-down existence with little hope for something better. <br/><br/>This sad circumstance is wholly embodied by Mickey Rourke, whose own demons have been well-publicized in the months leading up to ""The Wrestler's"" release. Simply put, this movie wouldn't work without Rourke's pained presence. His straggly, peroxide-blond hair and craggy moonscape of a face are disturbing wonders to behold. Physical and psychic pain surround him like some weird dark aura. It is hard to separate the character from the man, a fact that only strengthens the gravity of Rourke's performance. <br/><br/>Rourke's work makes it easier to overlook the clich√©-ridden elements of the narrative: The machinations of The Ram's attempt and ultimate failure to reconnect with his long-lost daughter, for example, are trite and predictable. Tomei is solid as the stripper-mom with a heart of gold, but there's very little chemistry between her and Rourke, making her actions toward the end of the movie rather unbelievable. <br/><br/>All that said it is morbidly fascinating to watch Rourke's take on a man of a bygone decade where people listened to Ratt without irony and considered pro wrestling a legitimate sport.<br/><br/>I also admire Aronofsky for not bailing viewers out with an easy-to-digest message or feel- good resolution. His grim vision scarcely gives viewers a chance to breathe."

","Mickey Rourke is back on form. I saw the trailer to this film and just knew I had to see it. The wrestling scenes were very well done - reminded me a bit of the wrestling one used to see on ITV on a Saturday afternoon during the 1970s in the UK. I thought the story was tightly organised and one could understand the main character's motive in continuing to wrestle - don't want to say more. I hardly ever give films such a high rating. This film stayed with me for hours after I'd seen it. Having seen The Reader all I'd say is that this film has so much more passion to it - especially from the performances of the 3 major characters - all have strengths and weaknesses. In some ways I found it a bit reminiscent of Million Dollar Baby - but it certainly isn't a derivative of that. Great sporting movie - but go and see it for yourself (shame on Bristol that the cinema in which I saw it was not even half full on a Saturday night)."

","The Wrestler isn't Rocky, it isn't Bloodsport, it's it own film and all the better for it. A fine film that captures in an almost drama documentary style the nadir of a formerly high profile Wrestler's life and career. The clich√© in the genre is that the real battle is the one that has to be fought outside of the ring, however despite that angle the director's take on the storyline has such a realistic feel to it that it just puts others in the shade.<br/><br/>Mickey Rourke plays the title role of the wrestler, as Randy (""The Ram"") Robinson who has to deal with adjusting to life with a ticky heart, a daughter who doesn't want him in her life and a love interest who is a table dancer who has her own set of problems. Acting by the three main leads (Randy, daughter and his love interest) are superb and at times difficult to watch as they are so good. The film is emotionally tense, and gives a good balance between the wrestling bout action and to the real life dramas out of the ring in Randy's real life.<br/><br/>Don't expect this to be Rocky or even Rocky Balboa in any way. Its gritty and dark in many places and not a feel good movie. Mickey Rourke has not done than this role, and come the award ceremonies his name will be commonly mentioned. A very good film.<br/><br/>Final question: Is this film also an allegory on Mickey Rourke's own acting career? Various parallels, but that's for himself to best answer I guess."

"rjyelverton","7","3","8","11 February 2009"," ""The Wrestler"" comes up short
","About half of ""The Wrestler"" works well. The film features a fascinating performance by Mickey Rourke who owns the role of a once notable entertainer cashing in on his former fame with diminishing returns. The only place Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson feels comfortable, the only arena in which he consistently succeeds, is the wrestling ring. Even though he is aging and his body is starting to turn on him, The Ram keeps heading back into the ring. It is the only place where he can be whole and fully realized.<br/><br/>And then there's his estranged daughter (Evan Rachel Wood) and stripper friend Cassidy (Marisa Tomei), the Mary Magadalene to his suffering servant. Assigned to Randy by Syd Field, they keep getting in the way of the authenticity that Rourke and Aronofsky establish in other scenes. For every seemingly unrehearsed scene focused on the backstage bonhomie of the Ram and the other wrestlers, there's a screenplay required confrontation between Randy and his daughter or Randy and Cassidy. These might not stand out as glaringly in a movie that employed less of a stripped down aesthetic. The film uses the over the shoulder, day in the life technique of the Dardennes, a grainy washed out presentation, and a raw performance by Rourke and the other wrestlers. These faux-verite elements clash with the pedestrian drama provided by the women in The Ram's life. But don't blame actresses Wood and Tomei. They're hindered by a predictable script.<br/><br/>Well worth seeing for Rourke's tremendous performance, but the movie as a whole comes up short."

","something that should have been obvious to me before going in. But the art-house cred that the film has gotten, the film festival screenings, the huzzahs from the critics, and Aronofsky's previous films made me think this would be much more than what it is: a fairly conventional, low-budget retooling of the same material that made ""Requium For A Heavyweight"" such a sensation in the 50's. Set in the world of professional wrestling, it hypes that 'sport' while at the same time bemoaning Rourke's character's fate, a typical commercial ploy these days in movies: condemning and exploiting at the same time, e.g., the poor, sad, lonely character played by Marissa Tomei, forced to do all that dirty dancing. Don't get me wrong: it's not a bad film, of its kind. And it could just as easily be sold as something for WWF fans. In fact it probably will be. But if it were, I certainly would have no interest in seeing it. So be warned: there's an awful lot of 'professional wrestling' in ""The Wrestler"". And what remains, minus the nudity and grisly violence, could have just as easily been a network television movie."

","You can tell from the rating that I did not care for this film. I didn't really expect to, not caring much for ""professional"" wrestling. (I did watch it when I was a kid, (Wahoo McDaniel, Johnny Valentine, Ivan Putski, etc.) This form of wrestling is a sordid business, which the film makes very clear. Mickey Rourke did put in a very good performance. He was utterly unrecognizable as the promising actor from the Eighties (Body Heat, Angel Heart, Barfly, etc.) I suppose that some years as a bad boxer can re-arrange one's face. Marisa Tomei was also very good putting some heart into the somewhat clich√©d stripper role. And she looks fantastic. While I didn't care for the ending, I'm not sure that more exposition would have been any better. In short, the acting was usually first-rate, in a film that is depressing and hard to watch. There is certainly a place for such cinema, but I cannot recommend this film."
"readyben","5","2","5","17 February 2009"," Not for everyone
","I came away from this film thinking ""OK movie, but why all the critical acclaim?"" Nicely filmed, acted and directed, but I still couldn't connect with it. The story is remarkably slow, especially getting started. There are also a few reaches you need to accept.<br/><br/>For a movie that is dead-on realistic in so many ways, why embellish on professional wrestling? Has pro wrestling changed? Are there now props set up inside the ring and plenty of bleeding? I guess I haven't watched it in a while. If that's now typical then I stand corrected. If not, then Hollywood once again is portraying unrealistically for the unknowing public, assuming they'll just accept it. It's frustrating to me that a director can think ""No one will notice that"" or ""People won't care."" This happens, for example, in a lot of medical scenes, although in this film the medical scenes are all done very realistically.<br/><br/>The relationship between Ram and Cassidy was believable until she fell for him and traveled to see him fight. The way it felt to me was that Ram just couldn't get it through his head that she wasn't into him. I never felt any chemistry between them - it was unidirectional, he was attracted to her, including during their ""just one beer"" scene. The story she told was that she was trying to improve her life and he didn't offer much toward that end.<br/><br/>Rourke's portrayal couldn't have been done better, but the weaknesses of the plot kept the movie itself from being excellent. A ""come back"" for Rourke? Maybe, but just a few changes in the story would have made a much stronger statement about how life for many is hugely successful, then over time it all dwindles, leaving lots of memories, but not much reason to be alive."

","The Wrestler is about the life of Randy the ""Ram"" struggling to make a come back in the world of wrestling (WWF style wrestling that is) after 20 years of being out of the popular wrestling circuit.

Being produced and directed by Darren Aronofsky I thought this was going to be a gem of a film. However, Aronofsky ""wrote"" Requiem for a Dream and this film pales in comparison to it.<br/><br/>I thought the film did not get into Ram's deepest personality enough. Sure he went through some tough times, but I didn't feel for him because I feel I really didn't get to know who he was throughout this film. I felt the dialogue should have been far more extensive. With that being said, the film should have been about an hour longer than what it was. By the end I was left feeling nothing for the Ram. I feel as though I should have cried in this movie but I didn't because I feel the choices he made were just that....choices. When he said nobody on the outside cared for him, I could have cared less as well because he didn't really try hard to make a good like for himself outside the world of wrestling.<br/><br/>All in all, I was very disappointed in this film. I would have given it a 6.5/10 but my only choice was 7/10 Not sure how this film got such high ratings....????"

","Showing at the London Film Festival as the surprise entry in the programme, 'The Wrestler', a film I would have avoided had it been listed by title, has interest purely because it provides 80s favourite Mickey Rourke with a powerful leading role. And he's good as ageing extreme wrestler Randy 'The Ram' Robinson.<br/><br/>It's just a shame that a/ the storyline is somewhat predictable: central character with medical flaw which could curtail his life? check; tart with a heart as a kind of love interest which doesn't really go anywhere? check; sulky teenage daughter with goth clothes and hate in her eyes? check ... b/ that there is as much gore shown as there is. I didn't think it was justified, although of course the subject matter means we have to see some of the life in the ring.<br/><br/>So it gets five stars for five things. First,some memorable scenes - Randy in the deli having fun with the customers, Cassidy and Randy shopping for a present for his daughter, Randy and his daughter dancing in a derelict building on a catch-up trip, the contrast of the sheer violence of the ring with a little kid playing with his doll figure of 'The Ram'. Second, a pulsing AC/DC soundtrack which really works. Third, Rourke's performance, which is excellent even if the film isn't. Fourth, for its style and energy. Fifth, for keeping exactly to a scenario we could see coming from the opening few minutes, but doing it in such a way that it isn't necessarily boring.<br/><br/>Not my cup of tea, then, and too violent in places, but 'The Wrestler' is a solid enough film of its type. Just not my type - but it is good once in a while to see something outside of your comfort zone."
"rmax304823","5","2","6","28 November 2009"," Requiem for a wrestler.
","The performances are uniformly fine, especially Mickey Rourke's dilapidated wrestler with his battered face. But Marisa Tomei is excellent too. She's a lap dancer and a bit more worn than Mona Lisa Vitti was. Rachel Evan Wood isn't on screen much but gets passing grades if only for her classically beautiful profile.<br/><br/>The movie stinks, although I don't think it knows it. It creaks at every joint, like Rourke, as it reaches for epic tragedy -- a proud man who will never allow himself to be beaten, even if it costs him his life, although in this instance the effort can hardly be worth it. Rourke simply knows the ropes of this phony, thoroughly choreographed business to well to take it as seriously as the script demands. The arena is so corrupt that a pissing contest acquires Olympic proportions by comparison.<br/><br/>The script is out of Screen writing 101 or McKee's textbook. First, show us something of the world the protagonist inhabits. It's a strenuous performance in the ring with real staples, barbed wire, chisels, chairs, and whatnot causing the blood to flow like Niagara while a thousand fans shriek with pleasure at each new brutality. Afterwards the actors ask each other, ""Was you okay with the staples?"" There must be a fragile romance developed between the clobbered lead and some babe in an equally degraded job. Throw in a member of the hero's alienated family, preferably a stunning young woman, for the thirteen-year-olds who may otherwise be bored when no one is having his body wrapped in barbed wire.<br/><br/>There must be a few set speeches at important moments. Confessions and apologies are always good, but so are barely controlled hysterical outbursts. ""I know I'm just a hunk of meat. I'm alone and I deserve to be alone. I just don't want you to hate me."" (A tear should roll down the speaker's cheek.) Marlon Brando had such a set speech with Rod Steiger in the back seat of a taxi but the lines glowed with verisimilitude, Brando delivered them with perfection, without pandering, he didn't have to cry. And the speech told us something that we didn't know, that hadn't already been shown to us. Rourke's speech only spells out what we can easily intuit. The writer doesn't trust us to be perceptive enough to have picked it all up. Tugging our heart strings in a way as cheap as the faux contests in the ring.<br/><br/>Dramatic structure -- triumph followed by tragedy followed by triumph followed by tragedy followed by -- where were we? The direction is rudimentary. Every significant statement is a close up. But why go on? You've seen it all before in one or another form: ""Requiem for a Heavyweight"", for instance.<br/><br/>It has some nice features though. The location shooting, all over wintertime New Jersey, couldn't be more evocative. Asbury Park looked from the outside exactly as it did fifty years ago. And the incongruity of the burly, battered Rourke in a plastic snood working behind the deli counter cracking wise with the customers. And Rourke staying up partying all night, then stumbling drunkenly out of some strange girl's apartment, staggering home, throwing himself fully clothed onto his bed, and sleeping until darkness falls. It was one of the few times I thought that I knew exactly how Rourke felt.<br/><br/>See it once, if you're curious. Rourke is unimpeachable. But it's not a good film."

In my opinion this surpasses any sports movie ever made, whether its Rocky, or Raging Bull Mickey Rourke outdoes them all with ease.<br/><br/>Marisa Tomei also delivers a solid performance, as a very convincing stripper approaching old age in her line of work. Her and Mickey Rourke's on screen chemistry was portrayed in an extremely realistic fashion. I easily think she deserves an award for Best Supporting Actress, as she lights up the screen more then Rosario Dawson(Seven Pounds), as well as Cate Blanchett(Benjamin Button).<br/><br/>This movie also provides perhaps the best song ever written for a movie in history thanks to Bruce Springsteen. If you do watch the movie, make sure you don't leave until after hearing the song play during the credits because in my opinion its just another part of the movie.<br/><br/>All and all Mickey Rourke has outdone himself, and this movie could possibly be my favorite movie of all time dethroning my favorites such as The Godfather, Forrest Gump, Goodfellas, Pulp Fiction and more.<br/><br/>10/10 The Dark Knight has nothing on Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson."

For the most part of the movie I forgot that I was seeing one, and it seemed like a documentary about an aging wrestler (Mickey Rourke) and a stripper (Marisa Tomei).<br/><br/>I have to say that both Mickey and Marisa gave everything they got to their characters. Their performance was simply outstanding, the best work I've ever seen from them. It becomes violent and sexual at times, odd scenes that really don't add much to the whole story (and prevent this movie to be seen by an younger audience) but I think this movie should be seen and reflected upon by everyone, regardless of age.<br/><br/>It is easy to not care about the future when the present is filled with success and popularity but it is after those golden years that the real life begins, and many successful people aren't prepared to have a quiet anonymous life. This movie shows us that struggle and how unprepared one can be.<br/><br/>The Wrestler's example should teach us a thing or two about life's choices and what we can do to prevent choosing the wrong things.

","Ever since being introduced to wrestling through the WWE by my two older brothers at a very young age, I have been a huge fan of wrestling. Admittedly, in recent years my obsession with the 'sport' has dwindled due to the realisation of its legitimacy as to be even named a 'sport'. However my admiration for those that participate in the sport has never gone away, rather it has only grown stronger. Being a professional wrestler is not only a job, but is an obsession, a way of life and that is expressed beautifully in this movie, The Wrestler. <br/><br/>Plot and Opinions<br/><br/>Could the casting of Mickey Rourke in leading role Randy 'The Ram' Robinson be any better? An actor of whom his own glory days seem a lifetime away depicts a washed up wrestler way past his own sell by date, and one who doesn't seem to want to go anywhere anytime soon. Working what can only be described as local gigs, Randy is still the-wrestler-movie-picture-10pushing himself to the limits, performing to small crowds against amateur 'opponents'. After a major turn in Randy's health he is forced to contemplate life, most noticeably through his relationship with his distant daughter. From there Randy's realisation of not being able to compete is truly heartbreaking and seeing him battle his demons is truly moving.<br/><br/>The wrestler is interesting in how it doesn't follow the generic sports drama story line of being the best and beating everyone. It's far deeper than that, it explores Randy's struggle, obsession, and sense of loneliness just to stay in the game. Anything outside the world of wrestling is difficult for Randy, he evidently feels safe, secure and fits in that environment. From that it is great how the Director has managed to depict the lengths Randy will go to stay in that environment, spending thousands of dollars on various performance enhancing drugs, the complete lack of friends or family, all sacrifices purely to compete. It's almost as if Wrestling is his coping mechanism, his bubble in which he can truly switch off and not have to worry. Everyone has their bubble, may that be gaming, music, chatting with their friends etc, however wrestling hasn't just becoming a coping mechanism for randy rather his entire life.<br/><br/>Now we all know the job of a wrestler is to perform but it's brilliant how the directors has depicted the juxtaposition between reality and performance. Represented beautifully in not only Randy himself but through Cassidy (Marisa Tomei) a 'friend' of Randy's, being stripper at a local strip joint. Upon asking her out on a date, she changes unrecognisably so, not only through her obvious change in appearance but through her innocent, streetwise, gentile speech, a performance I can only but truly commend Marisa for.<br/><br/>Notable Performance<br/><br/>Mickey Rourke (The Ram) ‚Äì From a very small leading cast it is difficult to pick the most notable performance, even though this may be an obvious choice it is truly deserved. You can only truly commend the level as to which Mickey has immersed himself in this role. He dives head first (literally in some cases) into every scene, he never goes over the top, never over exaggerates, rather he gives a very real performance, that only adds to the sincerity of the whole film.<br/><br/>Final Thoughts<br/><br/>It is often difficult not to think of clich√©s and fictitiousness with regards to wrestling. This film goes way beyond the surface of the glittering, over dramatised main event fights and comical dialogue. The Wrestler peels back the layers, exploring the ugly side, the real life of amateur wrestling and how ones fall from stardom can truly effect someone whom is truly obsessed with their profession. The Film is paced extremely well and every scene and sub plot adds meaning to the overall feel of the plot. Even if you are ambiguous or have a sincere dislike for Wrestling, it is still a great watch and relatable to those who simply can not let something go. 9/10"

","Being an old-school fan of professional wrestling (I grew up in the WWF's late 1980s-early 90s heyday), I was expecting to thoroughly enjoy this much-hyped film. Instead, I found it to fall quite flat for me for two specific reasons:<br/><br/>First, I think I came into viewing ""The Wrestler"" with too much prior experience/knowledge of professional wrestling. While the film depicts such unsettling scenes as the locker room drug/steroid deals, the brutal ""death matches"", and the lonely life that a pro wrestler leads, those were things I already knew, thus I wasn't shocked to see them on screen. Perhaps moviegoers who know nothing about the sinister side of pro wrestling would find those things more horrifying (and thus sympathize with Mickey Rourke's ""Randy the Ram"" character) than I did.<br/><br/>Secondly, I just wasn't sucked into what was supposed to provide the drama of the film. Randy's relationship with his stripper girlfriend didn't quite lend itself to incredible drama, because it wasn't fleshed-out enough, while his relationship with his estranged daughter flourished a bit too quickly to make the climax of the film as touching as it could have been.<br/><br/>So, although Rourke does turn in an inspired performance, I felt that the film was a bit too rushed in its dramatic efforts and didn't cover enough new territory (at least for me) to hold my interest. However, if you know very little about the backstage goings-on in professional wrestling, then this movie may shock you enough to truly care about Randy the Ram."

In the wake of a heart attack, the former icon attempts to earn a little extra cash while working in a deli and making an effort to reconnect with his estranged teenage daughter, Stephanie. Yet, despite Randy's continued attempts at convincing local stripper Cassidy to settle down with him in his humble trailer, the ring still calls to him. Later, when the prospect of a high-profile rematch with his longtime nemesis presents itself, Randy is forced to weigh his mortality against his desire to hear the crowd roar one last time. <br/><br/>It's a wonderful, career-reviving performance, and you can't imagine the movie without Mickey Rourke.Added to that,the movie presses too hard and too often, but the performances are strong enough to withstand the melodramatic impulses, and the themes of isolation and self- destructiveness are too sharply realized to be trivialized.And with with uncommon intelligence and brutal honesty, it examines the cost, and need, of battle which makes it a richly affecting, heart-wrenching yet ultimately rewarding drama."

","Darren Aronofsky proved to be an uncompromising sociological expert, plunging us into the soul of people incapable to face the emptiness of their lives, and therefore filling it with what most defines their personalities. Darren is to age what Scorsese is to sin, with nothing to envy from his elder in terms of technicality, and it's only fitting that he tackled the world of sports for one of the greatest character studies of recent years.<br/><br/>""The Wrestler"" belongs to the greatest tradition of sports film, those who focus more on the career of an ex-athlete and his incapability to express himself outside his field, it reminds of the heart-breaking film noir ""Requiem for a Heavyweight"" starring Anthony Quinn as an ex- champion forced to end his career after a fatal injury. ""The Wrestler"" has the poignancy of these films with an extra dimension that relies on a documentary value that almost confines to naturalism, we're far from the fast-paced editing and numeral jump cuts of ""Requiem for a Dream"", ""The Wrestler"" looks like a film shot by a hand-held camera trying to follow the huge body of an endearing antihero, with a sad poetry forever incarnated by Mickey Rourke in one of the greatest performances of the last decade: Randy 'the Ram"" Robinson.<br/><br/>Randy is huge, strong and tall and carries the gentle sweetness of Rocky Balboa but -and that's the key difference- he's a professional wrestler and nothing else, playing a sport so unfairly snubbed but finally redeemed by cinema. Indeed, the title says it all; it's not ""Rocky"" like ""Randy"". While ""Rocky"" was less about a boxer than a man who wanted to go the distance, the ""Wrestler"" is about a job, a profession and a passion. The film tackles the life of Randy but we all know that sooner or later, the man will get back to the ring, because this is what defines him. The beauty of sports is to allow people to express in an arena and prove their very value there, and this is precisely what undermines the conception of wrestling as a sport, and through the portrayal of Randy and all the other wrestlers, we understand that it doesn't take 'real competition' to be labeled as sports.<br/><br/>Granted all the wrestlers fake their hits or pretend to fall, who among us would try to imitate them, or take the risk to fall on his back? Wrestling is probably the most ungrateful sport because the level of pain and exhaustion is inversely proportional to its popularity. Less than a canonic sport, it's more appreciated as an entertainment, but while athletes can stop, don't we say in entertainment: ""the show must go on"". Wrestlers are modern gladiators, almost victims of the same bad treatment, but never down, this constant overlooking cements a feeling of solidarity between the wrestlers. Aronofski powerfully creates a contrast between the gory details and really gruesome and painful actions with the relative courtesy and gentleness of these guys, like some sort of real-life gentle giants, men who love and respect each other, and respect their fans, and this is what drives them, what drives Randy, more particularly.<br/><br/>And Randy had everything, he used to be popular on the ring, he had his name shouted by the fans, he even had his figurine actions, those were the flashy 80's. But somewhere between, he screwed around, distanced from his family, his wife; he drank, lost his appeal and became a caricature of himself forcing to stand thanks to medics. Randy becomes an outcast and what other choice he had than befriending other ones: an aging strip teaser named Cassidy, played by Marisa Tomei. Both have kids and can only contemplate the degradation of a world, ironically too cynical for them. Both are uneducated and can only count on their body as precious assets with a limited date. There's this sense of urgency to find a meaning for life before it's too late, and the film takes a tragic pivot when Randy suffers from a heart attack and is forced to finish his career for his health, at the risk of becoming a nobody.<br/><br/>The film progresses as the powerful journey of a man trying to find an opportunity in order to fight his inner demons. If he was dumb enough to lose everything because at least he could fulfill his passion, well, maybe his incapacity to play is an opportunity to fix everything, more importantly his relationship with his daughter, played by Evan Rachel Wood, having a job, and becoming a regular guy. Of course, as it comes with Aronofski's films, characters are given personalities and natures that they can hardly escape from, and what contributes to cement our empathy is precisely in the realistic way they remind us, that we can only remain true to our nature. In a heartbreaking scene with his daughter, Randy asked her not to hate him, and a tear runs from his eyes, I don't think the tear is about the past, because she already forgave him, but for the future because it's like he knew he would end up screwing again, but it would never be badly intentioned.<br/><br/>We all make mistakes in real life, that's what makes it an even more difficult arena, so there's still an ambiguity in what would be Randy's decision : getting on the ring again, is it brave because he would risk his health and even death for that or coward because he took the only thing he mastered and didn't try to improve elsewhere. That's the power of the Wrestler, it questions our own capacity to change and to adapt, and to go the distance of our own lives before making the courageous decision about what we want to do, at any prices. I guess that's what makes Randy a particularly heroic character, eager to sacrifice everything for what he loves. <br/><br/>One of the best of 2008, if not the best."

","I loved it when he totally lost his mind in the grocery store. I loved the touching scene with his daughter dancing in the abandoned building along the boardwalk. I loved the arguments he had with his stripper friend and his daughter especially. Mickey Rourke truly carries this movie as a true leading actor should. He got robbed of an academy award that year. Sean Penn really didn't need another one - the problem with old Hollywood is that they didn't have the heart to forgive mickey the first time. Mickey's talent is for the world's gain and Hollywood's loss. i can't forget the back shot of Ram as he walks into the forest after his heart attack and suffers complete exhaustion - i felt so much empathy for the character. And of course definitely the highlight is the final fight where he confronts his own mortality - such heartbreak for the viewer. Amazing awesome movie from Darren Aronofsky. Unforgettable."

","Randy ""The Ram"" was a famous wrestler who enjoyed the cheers of the satisfied crowd. But that was the 80's. He doesn't have a lot left going for him in the business... and then he has a heart attack. The doctors say he can't pursue that anymore, and he has to try to cope with a regular life, something he abandoned decades ago... maybe reconnect with his daughter that he hasn't seen for a long time. Like with everything else by Aronofsky, you don't have to be a fan of the specific activity it deals with(the others including doing drugs, math, searching for eternal life and ballet), and the main theme is again reality vs. fiction. For our lead, his life is in the ring. He has trouble making anything outside of that persona work, as well as with distinguishing between what someone appears to be and what they are. It's about identity, the fragility and loss of such, and that is something we can all relate to. The world of ""performing"" is the environment, and this does a nice job of establishing a situation and then moving on, not lingering and yet making us realize the boredom and pain of it. Dialog is good and realistic. The ending is ambiguous and effective. This is a genuinely touching drama. The pace doesn't pick up right off the bat, so I urge anyone who finds themselves into the conflict to stay with it. There is some nudity, sexuality, bloody violence and strong language in this. The DVD comes with a 43 minute documentary called Within the Ring that I will review on its own page here on the site and a two minute trailer. I recommend this to everyone who can handle it. 8/10"

","Darren Aronofsky's The Wrestler is a no-holds-barred story about life in and out of the ring. A powerful story that transcends the sports entertainment and makes a powerful commentary about relationships and the human condition, The Wrestler is one of the great films of the 21st century.<br/><br/>The Wrestler tells the story of Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson a wrestling superstar in the 1980's. Twenty years later, he's a middle-aged man living out of a trailer in New Jersey and working at a supermarket packing boxes on weekdays and independent wrestling shows at V.F.W halls on the weekends. His life is a sad, lonely existence and outside of wrestling he has very little connection to anyone save for Cassidy, an aging stripper he's trying to court. His existence is working and scraping up enough money to pay his rent, tanning sessions, and steroids to maintain his wrestling career, working towards a participating in a match celebrating the 20th Anniversary between him and the Ayatollah, now a used car salesman. He's doing okay until a brutal hardcore match with Necro Butcher. In the aftermath of that match, Randy suffers a heart attack that changes his life.<br/><br/>Years of wear and tear in the ring and drug abuse have caught up with Randy. Told by his doctor he can no longer wrestle, he must figure out a new way to make a life. After begging his surly boss (a powerful contrast from the supportive wrestling promoters who beg him for work), He works at the deli counter at the Supermarket. It's a painful and powerful contrasting visual as he makes his entrance into the Supermarket deli counter, one that symbolizes Randy's entrance into the real world.<br/><br/>Taking Cassidy's advice and tries to reconnect with his estranged daughter Stephanie. His efforts are rebuffed at first by Stephanie, but she does re-establish her connection with her father and promises to have dinner with her. However, when Cassidy rejects his advances and an opportunity at a serious relationship that night, Randy's world falls apart. Feeling lonely and hurt, Randy goes to a wrestling show to reconnect with wrestlers and wrestling fans, the only people he feels care about him, has and wild night with a female fan. As he returns home and falls asleep, he misses his dinner with Stephanie and she cuts him out of his life permanently. Recognized by a fan at the Deli counter and belittled by his boss, Randy not only quits his job, but gives up on life as well.<br/><br/>A man with nothing to lose and no connection to anyone or anything, Randy goes on to his final match with the Ayatollah. While Cassidy makes one last effort to reconnect Randy to the real world, he brushes her off. A hopeless and despondent Randy goes on to perform his last match with the Ayatollah. As the screen cuts to black before he comes off the top rope for the Ram Jam, the audience is left pondering if this is his last match or his last day living.<br/><br/>The Wrestler is a classic. I love the storytelling in this film; it gives us a brilliant insight into the wrestling business and how wrestling matches work. The writing in this film is reminiscent of Paddy Chayefsky and Rod Serling's early work, a social commentary about the human condition wrapped up in an entertaining story. Randy the Ram Robinson isn't just wrestling in the ring, he's a man wrestling with his own mortality and maintaining his connection to a world that has forgotten him. Outside of the ring he's a lost soul; we see how much the world that has passed him by in the scene where he's playing Nintendo with a young boy who talks about Call of Duty 4. It's like his entire world ended in 1985, from his clothes to the beat-up Dodge Ram Van he drives, he's a relic from another era trying to understand a world and people that have changed while he was grappling in the ring.<br/><br/>Director Darren Aronofsky's crafts a cinematic masterpiece filled with beautiful, moving visuals. Utilizing a pseudo-documentary style, Aronofsky's visuals give Randy's story grit, texture and a sense of realism. I didn't feel like I was watching a movie, I felt like I was watching real life transpiring in front of me. There are some shots that are incredibly powerful; the scenes with the old wrestlers at the convention in wheelchairs is one of the most moving pieces of film I've seen in years. We take for granted how much these athletes entertain us, and take no mind to what happens to them when they leave the ring. <br/><br/>The acting here is some of the best I've seen. Mickey Rourke gives the performance of his career in The Wrestler. This is Rourke's signature role, the one he will be known for generations to come. I feel he was ROBBED of an Oscar; Sean Penn needs to pack that statue and Fed Ex it to Rourke NOW. On screen Rourke disappears and becomes Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson. Evan Rachel Wood steals scenes as Rourke's Daughter Stephanie. Her emotions are so powerful in this film; I could feel her pain and hurt coming off the screen. I'm also wondering why she wasn't nominated for supporting actress Oscar; she was perfect in this film. Marisa Tomei is moving as Cassidy, she adds a graceful humanity to her character making us see the hardworking woman trying to make a living to take care of her family. Todd Barry Gives a solid supporting role As Wayne, the prickly supermarket manager.<br/><br/>The Wrestler is Shawn James Five-Star Essential DVD. It's a 21st Century Cinematic Classic; a film we'll be talking about for years to come like Sunset Boulevard and Marty, and The Hustler."
"hall895","6","1","2","9 June 2010"," A better performance than movie
","Twenty years ago Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson was a professional wrestling legend. Twenty years is a long time. Now he is a lonely, broken-down shell of a man. His past glories long behind him he still wrestles but now it is far from the bright lights and big arenas. Instead he ekes out a meager living on the independent circuit, performing in front of tiny crowds in high school gyms and community centers. To help make ends meet he unloads boxes at a supermarket. He's behind on his rent. He's falling apart physically and taking enough drugs to open his own pharmacy. Hopelessly estranged from his daughter he has no family. Not much in the way of friends either as his closest relationship is with an aging stripper who keeps him at arm's length. He leads a miserable, lonely life. He longs for the 1980s, mocking Kurt Cobain while extolling the virtues of Ratt. No, Randy the Ram hasn't evolved much in the past twenty years. He is who he is and that's all it seems he will ever be. Can he change? Maybe even grow a little? He can't be Randy the Ram forever, at some point he has to get on with his life and be Randy Robinson. As you watch his story unfold you can't help but feel he'll never get to that point. This is a man whose past always haunts his present.<br/><br/>Mickey Rourke received all kinds of accolades for his portrayal of The Ram and deservedly so. It's a gripping, powerful, somewhat haunting performance. Portraying this character is not exactly a stretch for Rourke. Sometimes it's hard to see where Rourke ends and The Ram begins. He embodies the character like no other actor could. But for as good as Rourke is the movie around him is not always up to the standards of his performance. There's very little character development. The Ram doesn't change, that's the whole point of the movie. And his character is the only one we get to know at all. His relationship with his stripper friend, played by Marisa Tomei, is never put into any context at all. We never get any sense what the real connection is between these two. We know they're both desperately clinging to careers which at their age they can't hold on to very much longer. But there has to be more to their relationship than that. At least you'd hope there would be. The emotional connection doesn't seem to be there. And this movie really could use some emotional connections. There's some emotion in The Ram's meetings with his daughter Stephanie but those scenes are fleeting. And Stephanie, played by Evan Rachel Wood, comes off as a bit of a spoiled brat. Maybe her father has given her good reason to be as cold as she is but we never get enough context to understand and appreciate that. Her character, like every character in the movie other than Randy, remains too much of an unknown. This is undeniably Randy the Ram's movie, his story. But perhaps a little too much so. And in the end where has this story taken us? It's an often bleak, depressing ride following this character whose story basically is that there is no story. He can't change. He's Randy the Ram, for good or for bad. Rourke's work here is excellent but the movie as a whole is something less spectacular."
"tubby1","8","1","2","17 January 2010"," Wrestling with life
","The Wrestler is a vivid, down to earth and deeply personal tale that is expertly crafted and directed without the need for elaborate or superficial trickery to provide its entertainment. <br/><br/>The film provides an inner glance into the world of wrestling without ever being overwrought with its subject matter. It conveys the love and deep affection of the wrestling fraternity and their sheer dedication and willingness to be physically punished for the art. <br/><br/>We are provided with the insight into the world of wrestling through Randy 'The Ram' Robinson. Randy a once revered wrestler is seeing out his last remaining days on the wrestling circuit in high school gyms and community centres, signing autographs to die-hard fans who still hold a high respect for the man. He carries physical scars of his wrestling experiences, and reminisces passionately about their inflictions. It is clear that Randy is submerged by his life as a wrestler, his walls are layered with posters and memorabilia of his time in the spotlight. The respect that the wrestling fraternity have for Randy as he turns up for these shows is perceptible, and this provides his motivation to continue his art and to push his aging body to extremes. <br/><br/>Into this equation is Cassidy an aging stripper played heartfelt and excellently by Marisa Tomei who Randy has visited, we must surmise on a number of occasions. Cassidy shares the same estrangement from her work, she is no longer the beauty that she once was and like Randy it has come to a chapter in her life where she fears the unknown, the possibility of being alone and away from everything she knows.<br/><br/>You will not find a more pitch-perfect performance than that of Mickey Rourke who effortlessly brings Randy to life with his staggering ability to convey his frustrations and motivations through physical and emotional trajectory. You believe in Randy's journey, his abiding attachment to the only thing he knows wrestling, and his efforts to seek a life away from its addictive allure. <br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky has produced a film of heartache and real engagement. The film touches the fear we all have of loneliness and resonates passionately without ever seeking a superficial spin much to its credibility, providing a potent and passionate film."

","Yesterday I saw The Wrestler for the second time and I came to the conclusion that I really do love every single minute of this movie and it is easily one of my favorites.The direction is outstanding and so is Mikey Rourke's performance.The wrestler tells the story of Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson, a faded wrestler who was a star in the 80's. Now he only does small wrestling shows,lives alone in a trailer and he's the shadow of the man he used to be.One day he collapses after a show and at the hospital he is told he won't be able to wrestle anymore.Feeling defeated, he starts to invest more in the relationship with Cassidy,a stripper in a local bar,and tries to reconnect with his estranged daughter...First thing you'll notice in The Wrestler is the camera work,the camera is most of the time behind the lead character following him,this is not only innovative but as strange as it seems it gives the viewer a better perception/understanding of the character. Its almost like the viewer is the character.Mickey Rourke's performance is simply amazing, and as many have said is hard to know where the character ends and Rourke begins which makes the overall experience even better. Not every actor could pull off this kind of performance,so Rourke was definitely the right choice and I'm glad Aronofsky got that and fought against the studio who wanted a ""bigger"" star. The score composed by Clint Mansel(what a genius) is beautiful and compliments the film.Evan Rachel Wood deserves to be mentioned as well, she has a small part but she takes the most of it.At the end of the day The Wrestler is more about people then the sport itself and that is what makes this movie so great.Pay special attention to the amazing and tremendously emotional speech by Ram(that also reflects Rourke's life) in the last scenes of the movie; its a brilliant speech and pretty much sums up everything that happen until that point, who the character is and the place he's at in that moment.Fascinating.<br/><br/>10/10"
"Quebec_Dragon","8","1","2","23 August 2009"," Compelling character study in the world of wrestling
","The Wrestler is a fascinating foray into what happens to those muscle bound pugilistic ""actors"" when they get older and their glory days are behind them. We view this by following the steps of Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson (Mickey Rourke), a pro wrestling champion back in the eighties who has fallen on hard times and still wrestles part time. Beyond seeing the tricks of the trade and the camaraderie between wrestlers (interesting in themselves), this movie is a human drama tackling themes such as loneliness, poverty, growing old and finding purpose in life.<br/><br/>It brought back Rourke to public consciousness and frankly he deserves all the praise he got. He inhabits the character both physically (he has the physique and the scars) and emotionally. His portrayal makes you care even if you find wrestling ridiculous. Marisa Tomei as his stripper friend is good and surprising because she dares to be topless more than once even though she's not so young anymore. There's an interesting parallel between the upcoming end of her career and the Ram who has trouble letting go of his own. Some of the most emotional compelling moments also come from the interactions between the Ram and his estranged daughter.<br/><br/>I also quite enjoyed when we see the Ram working at a normal day job. It's amusing but not in an over-the-top way (I since learned that some of it was improvised with real customers). The directing is sober, often following Rourke a few steps behind his back, perhaps to contrast with the flashiness of the wrestling shows. The fake wrestling, which is fake by nature yet dangerous nevertheless, looked authentic and realistic. I had issues with the open ending that's defensible dramatically but leaves you disappointed. Overall, it's a very good film, slightly overrated, on a subject rarely tackled seriously in fiction. It's well worth renting unless you're totally allergic to wrestling and even then. It should be requisite watching for wrestling fans but then it might lower their enjoyment of the ""sport"" afterwards.<br/><br/>Rating: 7.5 out of 10"

Maybe that's what made it all the more realistic for me. During the entire movie Mickey Rourke was nowhere to be found. And although you know how this story will end from the moment you see Randy appear on screen, it's too compelling to walk away. <br/><br/>It has just left me speechless."

"raptorclaw","8","1","2","21 July 2009"," Much like its protagonist, 'The Wrestler' is a flawed beast with a massive heart
","'The Wrestler' is the kind of movie you enjoy immensely while watching, and then, a few days later, find yourself wondering whether it was really all that good. You watch it again, and it's still pretty good. Darren Aronofosky's latest work, I'm glad to say, falls only a shade short of brilliance.<br/><br/>Much has been made (and will continue to be made) of the parallels between the story of Randy 'The Ram' Robinson and the man who plays him, Mickey Rourke. I will say no more than that Rourke is perfectly cast and, yes, OBVIOUSLY there's a lot of him in Randy. Rourke is far and away the greatest reason for the film's success - the story is fairly predictable, slides into dangerously corny dramatic places and the dialog serves up hokiness to match. But these flaws, like Randy's, only add to the charm of the film. While the screenplay might become a little too sentimental at times, Rourke never does. He imbues the Ram with conviction, pride and a kind of screwed-up goodness of heart that results in a screen presence so powerfully and, dare I say it, perfectly drawn it achieves a transcendent greatness the cinema hasn't seen since Daniel Day-Lewis in 'There Will Be Blood'.<br/><br/>You will root for the Ram. I guarantee it. He's not that smart, he's done a lot of things wrong, but he didn't MEAN to, y'see - convincing the audience of this is the movie's greatest triumph. It would have been easy to portray Randy as a poor dumb big fella, a 'sad-sack giant', and have the audience hurt a little bit in sympathy every time another character is mean to him. And Randy does get hurt a LOT in this film, physically as well as emotionally, but with Rourke taking it all in good humor and fighting to keep his head high, you will bristle in anger rather than cry in sadness when the hero is wronged. But this strength also creates a weakness, in that the primary tension of the movie becomes the audience's fear of seeing ANOTHER bad thing happen to Randy, which, for obvious reasons, disappears upon a second viewing.<br/><br/>Lucky the other actors are also very good. Marisa Tomei is customarily excellent as Randy's only friend, and Evan Rachel Wood shares a couple of very good sequences with Rourke as his estranged daughter. Randy's wrestling colleagues are all played by real professional wrestlers, lending a true authenticity to the matches and locker room scenes.<br/><br/>But what's the movie about? Rourke is Randy, an aging wrestler who was a superstar in the '80s but has been reduced to nothing more than an old-timer with a familiar name on much less glamorous wrestling circuits, performing at makeshift venues for tiny crowds. His only friend is Cassidy, a stripper who is also getting on a bit. Randy's plans for a comeback are scuppered when he has a heart attack after a particularly brutal bout; he has to quit wrestling, and finds himself completely unable to handle life outside the ring. His sense of mortality leads him to seek out his daughter after years of separation. She hates him, rather a lot and evidently for good reason.<br/><br/>Much more interesting than Rourke-Ram comparisons are Ram-Cassidy ones. Cassidy, whose real name is Pam, is a performer growing into middle age in what is typically a young-person job. They both expose themselves in front of adoring strangers, use fake names because their real ones aren't snappy or sexy enough, and they're both growing too old to keep doing what they do. Casting Tomei as a stripper could easily be misconstrued as an excuse for nudity, but it turns out instead to be the movie's major masterstroke outside of casting Rourke. <br/><br/>In my opinion, all good movies string together scene after memorable scene, and 'The Wrestler' has plenty of them. The backstage camaraderie of the wrestlers, the three big matches, Randy's stint behind a meat counter in a supermarket and the subplot with his daughter are all uniformly well done. The latter, in particular, is charming in a cheesy way - made so by Rourke again.<br/><br/>To conclude, 'The Wrestler' is a fairy tale. It is simple and clear, despite the relative ambiguity of its ending, and it rides completely - I mean it, completely - on Mickey Rourke's performance. For an actor to elevate an ordinary movie to greatness is no inconsiderable achievement. And this is only the first step of a comeback for him. <br/><br/>Highly recommended."
"jkysharma","10","1","2","6 June 2009"," Rourke
","Watching 'The Wrestler' makes it clear as to why Mickey Rourke was rated so highly at the turn of the nineties. Even with a film-maker of Darren Aronofsky's abilities at the helm, this is Rourke's film. In fact, having seen some Aronofsky's previous work (Pi, Requiem for a Dream, The Fountain), it's clear that he's modified his approach to suit the story and Rourke's portrayal of Randy 'The Ram' Robinson, a former wrestling champion reduced to doing gallery stunts for fans. Adopting a unique approach to filming, Aronofsky has the camera literally follow Rourke almost all the time. Over the course of the film, the audience is more or less 'behind' the character. The space he provides for the film's characters to interact recalls 'Requiem for a Dream'; Rourke's attempts to connect with Cassidy (Marisa Tomei) and his daughter Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood) don't require slices of the past getting a mention in the conversations. Their meetings have a familiar ring, making it seem as though these are not the first of his attempts to reconnect with them.<br/><br/>Marisa Tomei brings a touch of understanding to her role, that of a stripper with a heart. It's been done many a time before but there's a grace to this performance that makes an impression, the way it complements Rourke's interest in her. Which brings me to Rourke's performance. I don't know if it's the eerie parallels that the character graph has with his own career (as a professional boxer and actor), but the amount of vulnerability Rourke projects here goes far beyond the routine 'macho, gruff men with a heart of gold' that Hollywood usually throws up. Rourke really inhabits the character here, willing to give him second chances and essentially presenting alternately, a self-forgiving and unapologetic aspect, that his final act comes across not as a rejection of all things outside the wrestling world but more as an acceptance of the fact that he simply does not know anything else and it is too late to attempt to learn.<br/><br/>On the whole, I've had to reconsider my attitude towards wrestling as a sport. I've always thought of it as a sham and not worth the attention that the other sports deserve. Not that this film makes me want to start watching it with interest but it's broken all misconceptions on my part regarding the people who take part in it. Going by this film alone, wrestlers are sports-persons in their own right."

I don't like wrestling , i don't know nothing about wrestling. Till now. Great wrestling experience with very vivid presentation. Almost like a documentary.<br/><br/>4. Morbid movie? Excpetable?

","Mickey Rourke appeared in some notable movies in the 1980s, became a professional boxer in the 1990s, and returned to movies in the 2000s (unrecognizable but great in ""Sin City""). Now, he gets what has to be his best role ever: a washed-up wrestler. As Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson, Rourke shows one of the grimmest worlds that I've ever seen. One can see the similarity between Randy's life and Cassidy's (Marisa Tomei): they spend their existences in these worlds widely viewed as low and dirty, but they have to do whatever possible to make their way through life.<br/><br/>Some of the wrestling scenes made me feel as if I was in the ring getting pounded. Darren Aronofsky has created another impressive piece of work with ""The Wrestler"". They could not have made it better. This constitutes a major achievement for all involved, and I eagerly await their next movie."
"cibyll-1","10","1","2","21 May 2009"," What else left to say?
","OK, I didn't want to talk about the movie itself, because I hope everybody knows something about. It's a genius thing what happened and that's the point! I love the cinemas, always loved. And I love all the workers in it. I love the mood and the feeling of celluloid. And there is an actor now days, called Mickey Rourke. He was a superstar back in the 80s. Than, fate came and everything changed. He had a plan, to make a professional boxing career. And gone came something wrong. Mickey Rourke destroyed himself. He lost everything and everyone around him. He fell down and nobody thought, he can climbing up again. 10 years gone. World and media changed, Rourke didn't... he was there, lying in self destruction, pain and anger to being what he became. But a miracle was waiting him. He became a second chance to proof, Mickey Rourke is still amazing. And he did it. Stood up, worked hard, and reached again everything with a role in Darren Aronofsky's excellent, new movie. Rourke is back, and maybe better than ever. Deservedly. Now, everyone knows fighters can loose, but all of them has a power within to strike again, and climbing up to the top of the world. I wish Mickey Rourke a long and successful life, good health and a lot of power to working!"
"garissonangel","7","1","2","18 May 2009"," A feel-bad movie that feels much worse!
","It' true that this character study of ageing wrestler Randy 'the ram' Robinson is a great character study and that Mickey Rourke's performance in the lead is spellbinding. The detail of the techniques and practices of the wrestling world are also fascinating, as is the romantic sub-plot with pole-dancer Cassidy, and the scene with the staple-gun is completely unforgettable.<br/><br/>Why didn't I like it so much then? Well, I hated Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream as I've always loved the book and it seemed to me in 2000 that Aranofsky's vision had missed two important factors which made the book successful; - a real engagement with the characters in the good times and the cruel humour of the narrative. With the Wrestler I found it more of the same. Yes it's powerful, yes it's well made, but stories as bleak as this are hard to love. Somehow Ferrarra did it with Bad Lieutenant, (Kietel's moaning), and Neo with Irreversible, (for some), and even this director with Pi, but the Wrestler's relentless, (and occasionally painfully predictable), study of mortal futility hammers home the desperation without exploring anything positive or providing any hope or even a moral imperative for comfort. It's a Leaving Las Vegas for a more misanthropic audience and really, I'm not sure about the social use of such cynicism. In short, this is a very powerful film, but its almost pornographic in its all-seeing focus on Ram's imperfections, and weak in balancing them with human qualities which we can relate to. This one-sidedness makes it essentially nihilistic; don't expect to feel like partying afterwards!"
"KillerLord","9","1","2","6 May 2009"," A Good Movie But IMDb ratings have gone crazy!
","Let me start out my comment on The Wrestler by saying that it is a very good movie and is one of the best movies in recent times. I am going to devote a certain amount of my time trying to tell you on what I think about the IMDb rating system which might convey a message to the people that I have a negative opinion about this movie, so let me make it clear right in the beginning itself. I like this movie and I think it is a great movie with some really good directing, acting and scripting.<br/><br/>This movie is about a wrestler and his life. The movie draws a wonderful comparative analysis between the life of a wrestler and the life of a strip dancer. I have always wondered about what precisely was the difference between a strip dancer or a prostitute and the wrestlers. Both, at the end of the day, are drawing money for a living by doing something with their bodies. This movie resonated with me in the sense that it shows that parallel really well. Towards the end of the day, there remains no difference between the two, both are using their bodies, though in different ways in order earn their living. But then again, the comparison is only a small component of the movie.<br/><br/>The movie centers around the life of ""The Ram"", a professional wrestler, his life and his passion for wrestling. The movie is a reelistic movie. At no point, do we see something that is exaggerated or something. And of course the movie is an eye opener for some of the people who still think that Professional Wrestling is a real deal and it is also an eye opener for the other extreme bunch of people who think that wrestlers are complete fake. There is an intermediate view that one needs to understand about this industry. The results and the events are scripted, no doubt about that but the pain and the punishment are real. You are live in front of a thousand plus audience and there is no way that you can fake blood oozing out of your body due to a pack of nails stuck in it in front of them. They are trained to bear that pain and they bear it to earn their living.<br/><br/>I must tell you though that there is nothing this movie does which makes it stand apart as one of the greatest films in the history of cinema. So, how does this movie come out in the Top 250 of the IMDb list. The answer is simple. The formula used by the IMDb to calculate the eventual rating does indeed depend on the number of votes that movie has got. And so you shall see that the user base has expanded in recent times and that user base has given full energy in voting for the newer movies and thus you will find the newer movies finding top spots at the cost of older movies who people might not have seen at all. Simply said, there is nothing great about the movie The Wrestler in my opinion which gives it to be in league of the great movies of all times. That is an inherent problem with the public vote and rating system employed here.<br/><br/>Coming back to the movie, the direction is great. It shows the life of wrestling entertainment professionals quite well. The overall scripting has a quality of being identifiable with. No poetic dialog and no clean script. The language is that of a commoner and hence makes it great. The lead actor Mickey does a wonderful job with his role. He is a very likable character. Overall, this movie is a must-watch and even a bigger must-watch for the fans of professional wrestling."

","With the recent controversy started over this film by Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the dopes in the Iranian government will never get from seeing this flick is that the final grudge match in which the titular character, Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson takes on his foe ""The Ayatollah"" is really one of the funniest and most pointed satires at American xenophobia I have seen of late. But overall, even with the sex and drugs, ""The Wrestler"" remains what is probably the finest old-fashioned Hollywood offering of late, tracing its lineage all the way back to ""The Set Up"" and ""Requiem for A Heavyweight"". In fact, you could have made this film back in the 50s with Anthony Quinn or Robert Ryan in the lead.<br/><br/>Like those films, ""The Wrestler"" is a compelling narrative of wounded masculinity and spiritual redemption. Mickey Rourke stars as former 80s pro wrestling champ Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson, whose image seems to be a composite match-up of Hulk Hogan, Ric Flair and Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts. Now old, lonely and living in a trailer, with an estranged daughter he has not met in years and reduced to playing the minor circuit, a heart attack causes him to rethink his direction in life. Yet it is not long before Randy finds out that the ring is the only place where he will ever feel at home, and heads for a comeback fight with his old rival, from which he likely will never return...Marisa Tomei stars as Cassidy/Pam, the stripper with a heart of gold who befriends this broken down soul as the story takes place over the course of a New Jersey winter. Both of these figures are star pupils of the school of hard knocks, but while Tomei looks set to graduate, Randy may never get out alive because he has long ago made a choice that he can never run away from.<br/><br/>This is probably the first film to ""get it"" about pro wrestling, that beyond the colored tights and the buffoonery and the xenophobia and meanness that it displays and encourages, it's really an art that brings joy to a lot of people and that ironically, requires absolute sportsmanship to be a part of.<br/><br/>Tough, tender and uncompromising in its compassionate depictions of two individuals in professions that revolve around physical degradation in the name of artificial beauty. Despite its use of hand-held cinema-verite style in some shots, ""The Wrestler"" is in all the best ways, a remarkably old fashioned film. Proof that good storytelling never goes out of style.<br/><br/>And the Springsteen theme song is amazing, one of the best compositions of the Boss in a while."
"somehope","10","1","2","13 March 2009"," Rourke's ""The Ram"": One of the best four performances by a man.
","Place Brando's Terry Malloy; De Niro's Jake La Motta, Kietel's Bad Lt., and Rourke's Wrestler together, and you have four of the greatest roles a man could emmulate. (One day, I'll describe four great actresses, but of now ...) Each actor allows the character to be a strong man man physically, but suffering through their soulless existence in such a way, that regardless of capturing Oscar gold or not, the performances say what men cannot say about their inner lives.<br/><br/>Alright, Brando is gone, and he left behind ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" to ""The Godfather"" and could act out of places actors only dream about, but only in ""On The Waterfront"" do we we see a young powerful, muscular Brando open up his soul as a conflicted boxer/bum who ultimately finds redemption by betraying his mobbed-up life, and he is left a bloody mess himself for doing so. He's given the 1950's happy ending, but only because of creative forces outside the film, and within the film the soul of a priest/leader played by the now-late Karl Malden. <br/><br/>He receives the love of a forbidden: the sister of the man whom he helped kill only by standingup and taken his blood punishment in the streets. Up until ""Last Tangoin Paris' "" monologue about his his wife, only ""I could have a been a contender ..."" is the greatest examination of a bum/hero's soul.<br/><br/>Due to space, I'll put DeNiro's ""Raging Bull"" performance and Kietel's NC-17 ""Bad Leiutentant"" individual performances together. Jake LaMotta was a prizefighter who was never alive with soul until he went into the ring and bloodied his opponent. He was a hero in the boxing ring; a bum outside it. Fueled with jealousy, rage, and self-hatred, we see him as both just like Malloy, except there is no true redemption for him. He sold his soul to the sport and his inner demons long ago, and with age, he is left with just an imitation of himself, ironically channeling Brando's Malloy without any true heart.<br/><br/>The Bad ""Lt."" (he is never given a name in Abel Ferrera's sleeper) is a Catholic and a crooked, whore chasing, drug addict, cop who cries in the nude because he slouches through life with no reason to live, except for one raped nun in this NC-17 drama. It is here that he starts to feel again some sort of redemption process and a glimpse of a soul in his heart. Yes, he is evil, and he winds up a bum's death, but not before, like Malloy, he feels something within his heart. The ""Mean Street"" boys actually show you their souls through their actions. They carry on Brando's torch in these roles and in their bodies.<br/><br/>Finally, Rourke's Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson is a collection of these characters. He can only find his soul in a pro wrestling ring, not a boxing one. His reality belongs to the fans and the men who he wrestles. He is a bum, but he is past his prime of commanding main event status. He still draws them in, and could have still could have been a contender ... in life, if he had chosen to be a better human being. He is more tragic than the Lt., because although he is a drug user, he is also a decent man trying to feel something for the forbidden love of a stripper who is fading away from her glory days (just like he is) and a daughter he would love if he knew how to love. Randy and Cassidy, the stripper, can make fantasies for others come true, but somehow if you look at Rourke's and Marisa Tomei's characters, you know that they lost their souls somewhere and are now paying for it. And that's what really good acting is all about: in every movement there is a bit of your soul choosing to live or dying because it can't.<br/><br/>See these movies, see the actors who peel way their souls. Different eras mean nothing to the essence of these Hemmingway-like characters. Each actor has created a character that lives by a code, or a lack of one, that hurts him in the end, and in doing so, creates one of the most articulate pictures of inner turmoil from characters that one expects only grunts or shows. <br/><br/>Before commenting on my comment, review each film -- ""On the Waterfront;"" Raging Bull"", and Bad Lietentant"" and you'll see where the ""Ram"" came from."

","The Wrestler - My Review Category: Movies, TV, Celebrities <br/><br/>To say Mickey Rourke's career has been up and down is a bit of an understatement. Back in the 80's he showed great promise when starring in films like "" Nine and a half weeks"" "",Rumble Fish and my personal favourite "" Angelheart"" . The trouble was , Rourke had a self destruct button that he seemed to press far to often . He was hated here in the UK at the time for donating some of his salary to Irish terrorist's the IRA .Directors began to avoid him and the movie roles dried up. He even embarked on a career in Boxing until retiring undefeated after eight fights. After that he seemed to disappear off the face of the earth.<br/><br/>A few years ago a was reading a magazine and i saw a photo of Mickey Rourke and i couldn't believe what i saw. His appearance had changed dramatically because of excessive plastic surgery and seemed to have lost his boyish good looks. Understandably the opportunity to make it big again in acting seemed a million miles away. That is until a director called Darren Aronofsky decided to show faith in him and what a fantastic decision that turned out to be! <br/><br/>Back in the late '80s, Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson was a headlining professional wrestler.

Yet all this cannot compare to the allure of the ring and passion for his art, which threatens to pull Randy ""The Ram"" back into his world of wrestling.<br/><br/>The Wrestler is without doubt one of the best movies i have seen in a while. How , at this years Oscars , it was not nominated for Best Picture or why Mickey Rourke didn't win best performance by an actor in a leading role is beyond me. It's certainly a better than Sean Penn's lead in ""Milk"". Perhaps he burnt too many bridges in the past amongst the film fraternity and he's now paying the price ? <br/><br/>His portrayal of Randy Robinson is so real. It feels like it could be a documentary it's that real. I loved his honesty and the way he knew he had done wrong in his life but he just wanted to make things good but wrestling was his life and ultimately his downfall. In his own words "" I'm an old broken down piece of meat and I deserve to be all alone, I just don't want you to hate me"" It's not just the wrestling scenes that Rourke performs that are impressive it's his overall acting. I never ever thought he had that ability in him .<br/><br/>One interesting fact that i found out was that Nic Cage was originally going to be in the lead role of The Wrestler - thank god that never happened.<br/><br/>The Gorgeous Marisa Tomei is superb also and the comparison of her lap dancing career being the same as ""The Rams"" wrestling career did not go unnoticed. I'm not sure if some of the blood in the wrestling scenes were real but it certainly looked it and director Darren Aronofsky deserves enormous credit for coming up with a thoroughly gripping and entertaining movie and when those final credits roles it left with me wanting more.<br/><br/>10 out of 10"
"jackharding89-1","10","1","2","27 February 2009"," Believe the hype- this one's a winner.
","20 years or so ago, as the eighties dispersed into nothing more than memory- so to did the acting career of Mickey Rourke. A once glorious, once rugged young talent whose forthrightness got the better of him- landing the once promising, once striking up and comer a place on Hollywood's cold shoulder and a fruitless career in the Boxing ring.<br/><br/>A handful of decent comeback turns aside, Rourke has long been considered a lost and wasted talent who, given the right attitude, could've flourished and seized those early day likings to late greats' James Dean, Paul Newman and Marlon Brando.<br/><br/>Mirrored to an extent, then, is Rourke's chronicle by the character he plays (and how) in 'The Wrestler'- Randy ""the Ram"" Robinson. A weary, washed-up wrestler. A has-been. A nobody. A nostalgic, runaway father who lives and breathes his in-ring pseudonym. Back in the mid to late eighties, Randy was a star. Now, 20 years on, he's a loner. A mountain reduced to a mound. A champ turned chump. When he's not roaming the rings of the weekend amateur wrestling circuit, he's pumping iron, shooting steroids and hauling ass at the local deli.<br/><br/>All in all, Randy's a nice guy: likable, easy going and even Christ-like but after suffering a serious heart attack, the inevitable bad news is dealt: wrestle again and you could die. Now- Randy has a choice to make: go on living the only life he knows or get moral and stage one last crack at righting his wrongs: patch things up with his daughter and settle down with his favourite stripper.<br/><br/>The role of Randy is perfect, then, for Rourke. Not only does it give the 52 year old a shot at ""the"" lead many have been aching to see him grapple with for years, but it also allows him the substance and space to churn out the performance of his life. Beneath his unsightly exterior still stirs the wit, charm and dazzling panache that once promised so much. Mickey Rourke is, perhaps, the only actor out there who could approach this hearty part with the means, motives and memories to draw upon so effortlessly. For Rourke, this is a crossroads. A hairpin. A renaissance. A turn that sees the life of a wayward actor congregate with that of a fictional pugilist to summon something heartfelt, bona-fide and pretty dam special.<br/><br/>Directed by the visionary Darren Aronofsky, 'The Wrestler' is a moving and masterfully shot treatise on human nature and endeavour. The acclaimed cult director, whose former triumphs include 1998's cyber-surreal 'œÄ' and 2000's stunning 'Requiem for a Dream', could be described as a dazzling mix of Davids' Lynch and Fincher with a generous pinch of Kubrick thrown in- and yet he is none of them. He's a budding maker of dense psychological dramas that centre on the self-seclusion of characters trapped inside their own bubbles of being.<br/><br/>Although considerably different in terms of visual style to Aronofsky's previous three features, 'The Wrestler' s a quite superb slice of American cinema that displays the 41 year old helmer's resourcefulness and new found maturity as a director. His 'Wrestler' is a smart yet simple tapestry of hand-held shots, moving cameras and tracks. Aronofsky's crafted an instant classic of the independent sphere that deserves attention. 'The Wrestler' is his most authentic film to date: a toned-down, slowed-down character piece with a big, brave heart.<br/><br/>Forget what you think you know about wrestling. This film is far a field from fake and a mere whisker from perfection. It's a morality-play, of sorts, but without the histrionic moralising and feel good summit that sugar coated this sport film to that. Yes, the proverbial blood, sweat and tears are there alright but this isn't a rewarding underdog tale or rags to riches yarn. This is neorealism. This is life: unfair, unfulfilling and un (bloody) reliable. Aronofsky drags cinema back onto the streets and hones in on reality. The nice guys aren't nice, they finish last and the 'heroes' keel over on their way to save the day. Yet, 'The Wrestler' emerges a flat-out winner: an often gritty, sometimes comical affair that fluctuates between the rough and the fine, the tough and the touching.<br/><br/>An unknown yet high-class supporting cast also come to pass- leaving nil to be desired which, ultimately, brings me back to Mickey Rourke who'll no doubt bare the brunt of the film's justifiable ovation. Darren Aronofsky steers his leading man towards a standout turn that could see the born-again thesp' land a fair few gongs this season. An Oscar?.No. I think Sean Penn's got that one sewn up but for such a question to prompt a pause for thought says an awful lot. Rourke is magnificent. Memorable, even, in this able all American gutter film that's going to give this year's best a run for their money."

","This comment maybe contain's some spoiler's.I watched the wrestler the other day and as i expected it was great.The entire movie is based on the main character Randy The Ram Robinson.There is no screwing around in this movie and that's what i like.Through the whole movie we know what kind of person he is and what kind of person he was.In some way's good in some way's bad.He is a wrestler that's getting too old for his job but he don't want's to make piece with that fact.Anyway,as he find's out that he has a heart problem's and that he can't wrestle anymore,he begin's to understand what he throw away for his career and he tries to win it back.So he contact's his daughter after a long time and tries to restore the relationship with her.Beside that he start's falling in love with a stripper.<br/><br/>As the time goes and as he makes a better relationship with his daughter he still can't accept the fact that his wrestling career is over.So the question is will he throw his career away for all the other thing's in life including life it self or will he go back to wrestling and risk having a heart attack.<br/><br/>Some people will say that this movie has many subject's but i think it doesn't.It's only subject is that he has to choose between having a normal life or not.And under that subject belong's the relationship between him and his daughter too.<br/><br/>It's a great movie that don't sniff's around but it say's what it has to say and that's it.And that's what i like about this movie.<br/><br/>However when i watched it my friend said that the ending ruined the entire movie for him.That he don't understand's what happened next but i think that that's the best part about it! I also have to mention that the movie is followed by great acting from Mickey Rourke which was inexpressibly good and of course from Melisa Tomei which was also great as a single mom who work's as a stripper only so she could feed her son.She really was good too but Mickey was the best generally,not only in this movie but generally this year.I think the reason for it is because he wasn't really acting,he was more him self in this role since he had similar life as Randy The Ram Robinson.<br/><br/>Among the million thing's that are great in this movie,one stand's up an that's The Ram as a character.He is just so realistic and weird.He lives a lonely life and he is only happy when wrestling.One of the better scenes in the movie if you ask me is when he call's that nine or ten year's old kid to come and play Nintendo with him.That was absolutely brilliant description of having a lonely life.Absolutely brilliant! <br/><br/>One other thing that's great is camera,the way the movie was shooted.It's just so great and realistic.It don't changes angles so much but it more kind of follows the character through the room which gives so much realism in the certain scenes and the entire movie.Really great achievement.<br/><br/>I wont write anything else about the movie,i will just say that this movie i recommend to everyone because it is one great movie.Maybe even the greatest in 2008 and i think it's shameful that it didn't receive The Movie Of The Year nomination.S-h-a-m-e-f-u-l!!!The academy should be ashamed of it self.<br/><br/>This is a must watch movie.Watch it under any cost!!!"

THE WRESTLER is to ""professional wrestling"" what FAT CITY is to boxing: an unvarnished look at the guys at the bottom (and why they sometimes end up there). Like ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper, Mickey Rourke's Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson has his day in the sun (the often referenced first match with ""The Ayotolla""), but hits the skids somewhere along the line and ends up one missed rental payment away from homelessness. (I once spent an unbelievably hot and humid night in a North Carolina high school gym- where the air-conditioning had, of course, gone out- helping carry and assemble a wrestling ring for a local troupe. I was also their videographer that night. These were the kind of guys who weren't household names in their own homes, if you know what I mean, but they gave it their all. There was one guy who'd actually been on a big time cable show several times, but now he was bottom feeding. The most interesting aspect of it all was seeing how the wrestlers themselves swarmed all over the promoter trying to get their money before he could give them the slip. I found it all a bit amusing until I showed up to video tape another event- held in the parking lot of a biker bar- and got nothing for my trouble but a pat on the back. Truly, the greatest show on Earth...) Rourke's Robinson is one of the most sympathetic characters in the annals of sympathetic screen characters (it was almost impossible for me to keep from bursting into tears every time he delivered one of those quiet comments that sent shivers down my spine and his examination of his surgical scar- which I call my ""autopsy scar""- had me quivering with repressed emotion). If you haven't seen THE WRESTLER, I urge you to do so at once- and don't forget to bring a hanky."
"boondoggle129","10","1","2","11 February 2009"," Tightest movie about family ever
","The punch line, if you get it, is what makes this a clean, tight story. Rourke and Tomei, or, Tomei and Rourke, have proved their abilities to pick and deliver a pivotal last word in a cinematic tale.<br/><br/>I was overcome when I realized this was a movie about family. I found absolutely no flaws in the logic of the character's actions. I was brought into a world I knew existed, but never experienced. The POV (point of view) brought me right into the lives of the protagonists. The clich√©s about happiness were eschewed in the world of this setting. This movie helps us accept that happy endings are simply a matter of POV. But the point of the movie is simply that fairy tales can be nightmares, and nightmares can be fairy tales.<br/><br/>This is a beautiful, and perfect, moment in story telling."

","I had seen Frost/Nixon shortly before this film and had thought ""Wow, Langella did a great job. He deserves the acting acclaim over Mickey Rourke."" (I assumed this because Rourke's role seemed more meaty.) My God was I wrong! Rourke is nothing short of incredible, the power in his performance is overwhelming. There are few performances that truly get under your skin and his is one that grabs a hold of you and makes you feel him. Really one of the greatest performances in the history of film, really.<br/><br/>The film itself is extremely effective with its use of faith, violence, and pride. Definitely one of the best I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Marisa Tomei is also very good as his love-interest/stripper as well as Evan Rachel Wood as his daughter.<br/><br/>If you want to see some incredible acting, go see this film.<br/><br/>*For the Future* If Penn's won the Oscar now, I just want you to know that's wrong... very very wrong.... *FTF*"
"user-28221","10","1","2","9 February 2009"," The movie is very pure inside
","I believe if I were about the same age with The Ram I would probably love this movie even more. And the fact is I am much younger than him yet I can hardly love this movie better. It's not just the acting of Mickey that makes me relate to The Ram; it's the script that added to it. <br/><br/>The end is absolutely unique among the genre. These years a lot of films centered on a sports team or individual struggling to make their way back to top or underdogs winning respect by beating the best... have been wanting to be different by having a surprising end, such as Million Dollar Baby. They know if the hero wins at last, as usual, the audience will be bored. So they tried to make some change. But no matter how the change happens, the hero wins in his way, and the movie is still made to motivate people. The wrestler, on surface a movie to motivate people to never give up on themselves even if you are too old or too ill, but deeply, it's very sad; it is a movie about self-redemption through self-destruction. <br/><br/>The Ram is literally a man with nothing to lose. He struggles to find his normal life back(if he ever had one), but in his attempt he finds no one needs him, and he, in despair, turns to wrestling again, because there are the people who need him. He doesn't go back pick up wrestling again because he wanna have the showdown with his old rival; he goes back, because there is no other way to go. If he could lead a normal life he wouldn't have chosen to go back for he knows very well that he may die if he wrestles again.<br/><br/>So here is what he says: I just want to say to you all tonight I'm very grateful to be here. A lot of people told me that I'd never wrestle again and that's all I do. You know, if you live hard and play hard and you burn the candle at both ends, you pay the price for it. You know in this life you can loose everything you love, everything that loves you. Now I don't hear as good as I used to and I forget stuff and I ain't as pretty as I used to be but god damn it I'm still standing here and I'm The Ram. As times goes by, as times goes by, they say ""he's washed up"", ""he's finished"" , ""he's a loser"", ""he's all through"". You know what? The only one that's going to tell me when I'm through doing my thing is you people here.<br/><br/>And he knows this is self-destruction...... and self-redemption."

","Are you tired of the same movie over and over? The Wrestler could be the film that you are looking for. I know what you are thinking- ""I don't really like pro wrestling"". Trust me, that doesn't matter. The Wrestler is a brilliantly acted and directed human tragedy that will violate your senses with amazing visuals and heartbreaking dialog. Mickey Rourke gives the finest performance I have seen in two years, much better then the future Best Actor winner Sean Penn in Milk, and Marisa Tomei again surprises the masses with an excellent and compelling performance. There has never been a film that has jumped this deeply into my heart and emotions. The artwork is mediocre, but the everything else is fantastic. If you enjoy great acting- watch The Wrestler. If you enjoy great direction and film making- watch The Wrestler. If you enjoy hard hitting, tear jerking, action involved, dialog driven works of art- watch The Wrestler. One of the finest works I have ever seen."
"jzappa","10","1","2","2 February 2009"," A Walloping Emotional Powerhouse
","The Wrestler, a walloping emotional masterstroke, is about a man who can do one thing well, and doggedly continues to do it because of desperation, drowsy ability, and pride that always needs a lot of healing. He's a professional wrestler. From someone who feels like stabbing himself in the head whenever he sees pro-wrestling on TV, this remains one of the very best films of 2008. In a wrestling match, it's scripted that the villain blindsides the hero, who acts as if he doesn't see him, and body-slams him, but when the hero hits the floor, how does one fake that?<br/><br/>Mickey Rourke plays the haggard, impoverished, abandoned hero, Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson. This is the performance of his life. And I mean that in every way in which that sentence can be interpreted. This is Rourke doing breathtaking physical acting. He has the corporeality of a body builder, maybe owing to some steroids, which would also be appropriate of Randy. He gets into the ring and does the extremely bloody work. His ring performances and the abuse he endures cement the backbone for the story, which involves his estrangement from his daughter, played with chameleon-like persuasiveness by Evan Rachel Wood, and what he hopes will become a relationship with the stripper Cassidy, played by the great beacon of Italian-American godesshood Marisa Tomei, who never ages. Never ages! Except for his backstage brotherhood with other wrestling veterans, whose peripheral performances brilliantly discern between the big-hearted companionship backstage from the brutality on it, Randy has incinerates all his bonds.<br/><br/>Cassidy is as much a performer as Randy. They put on a show and give the customers what they want. It pays the rent. There is always a void between entertainers and their audiences. That's why so many of them marry each other. But Randy has become wiser in certain marginal respects with the years, less bedazzled by celebrity, more capable of accepting emotional longing. Randy has a residual friendliness and sweetness, which both helps and hurts him.<br/><br/>Beyond the overwhelmingly putrefied atmosphere, the most absorbing aspect in Darren Aronofsky's powerhouse drama is the backstage nuance of low-rung pro-wrestling. In the dreary snow and slop of New Jersey, Randy and his challengers make the rounds of dingy union halls, school gyms, community centers, using whatever they can find for makeshift dressing rooms, duct-taping their wounds, priming their pumps and agreeing minutes before a match on its script. We grasp how they make themselves bleed, concoct brutal ""surprises,"" parley over each fight. And then the audience sees them. Their preparation merely sees that they get battered in the ways for which they prepare, and not in unanticipated ways.<br/><br/>I cared as deeply about Randy the Ram as any movie character I've seen this year. Machismo is something treated as inscrutable and distinctly characterized, and its residue cuts into all of us men, however macho we happen or choose to be. Aronofsky's manner of filming Rourke hand-held from behind powerfully signifies this. I have unqualified appreciation for an ubermasculine man with the physique and dominating sneer of Mickey Rourke who so unabashedly renders a tremendously muscular man in a profession that takes culturally induced machismo to the very extreme, and yet a man who can look behind his projected sense of self into a sentimental heart with needs, regrets and inferiorities. By the end, I was so mesmerized that I was surprised by the hard cut to black."
"Red_Flag","10","1","2","31 January 2009"," It hits like a punch to the gut.
","Whatever you opinion on Darren Aronofsky previous film, The Fountain, that shouldn't affect you judgement on whether or not to see The Wrestler. Not only is Darren Aronofsky most mature, authentic and untimely heart crushing movie a film that will go down as one of Aronofsky best but it's the performance Mickey Rourke's been building his carer up for. There isn't a second that Rourke is caught off guard, his presence is undeniable his performance, Oscar worthy. There's this haunting quality for a film so authentic, which really adds to the overall feel you get from watching it.<br/><br/>This is strong meat, and the exact opposite of a feel good chick flick. You end up with a visceral sense of a brutalised, brutalising celebrity culture, its attractions for adoring and adored alike. Most films take a benevolent view of the masses - hardly surprising, really, since they are trying to make money out of them.<br/><br/>This movie isn't afraid to show the cruelty of the public, and that's virtually unique in a Hollywood film. I watch very few movies which couldn't have been improved upon, but this is one of them. I loved every mythic moment of it.<br/><br/>His sense of identity fading into nothingness after the spotlights dim and he experiences a close brush with mortality, a retired wrestler begins to evaluate his life while considering the comeback that could very well kill him in director Darren Aronofsky's poignant portrait of an introspective former superstar in the twilight of his career. Back in his heyday, wrestler Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson (Mickey Rourke) was an icon in the ring. His image immortalized in action figures and video games, he would headline arenas across the globe.<br/><br/>Twenty years later, those glory days have passed, and Randy is forced to earn his keep by brawling before handfuls of fans in high-school gyms and community centres around New Jersey. In the wake of a heart attack, the former icon attempts to earn a little extra cash while working in a deli and making an effort to reconnect with his estranged teenage daughter, Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood). Yet, despite Randy's continued attempts at convincing local stripper Cassidy (Marisa Tomei) to settle down with him in his humble trailer, the ring still calls to him. Later, when the prospect of a high-profile rematch with his long-time nemesis presents itself, Randy is forced to weigh his mortality against his desire to hear the crowd roar one last time.<br/><br/>Aronofsky has pulled off that rare feat - he's made a great film about a niche subject that will delight wrestling fans and cineastes alike. And Rourke's performance is a knockout. The characters may be stereotypes to us, but they're played here with a love and tenderness and resignation that could break your heart. Emotionally engaging, superbly directed drama, with a terrific script and a powerful, award-winning performance by Mickey Rourke.<br/><br/>Verdict: This is a movie that improves on repeat viewing, having seen it twice already I can easily say it's one of my favourites of the Oscar season, the film resonates for hours after the final credits roll and even if you not enjoying the movie for the most part the end is guaranteed to floor you unlike ever before. For the most part ""The Wrestler"" defines movie perfection. Brutal, brave and brilliant. This is an emotional roller-coaster that pulls out all the stops and sticks with you days after the films over. It's as simple as that. For my overall rating I give ""The Wrestler"" 5/5."

And the ending is just what I expected a movie like this should have, absolutely brilliant. But the thing it teaches you the most is to love what you do and do it no matter what,it shows that wrestling is a sport filled with passion, Considered like rocky, no, Rocky was at his prime in his movies , Randy ""the ram"" wasn't, he was a great one in the past, wrestling is a crowd sport its the roar of the crowd that makes you go on and I think that view of fans admiring you and making you go on is beautiful."

","Best Picture 2009 Watch Current mood: artistic Category: Movies, TV, Celebrities<br/><br/>The Wrestler - ""In this life you can lose everything you love, everything that loves you. A lot of people told me that I'd never wrestle again, the only one that's gonna tell me when I'm through doing my thing, is you people here."" - Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson<br/><br/>The Wrestler was the film I was most excited to see this movie season. From one of my favorite directors (Darren Aronofsky) this movie has received close to universal acclaim from critics all over the world, lauding its unique story, unique characters and the performance of one man many thought would never return to the screen, Mickey Rourke.<br/><br/>Whenever an actor/actress is so praised over a role I am normally skeptical, this is one important exception. 20 years ago, Rourke's entrance into Hollywood was lauded by critics. With films such as Diner, Body Heat and Angel heart pointing towards a lengthy and successful career, which was to be short lived. His rather eccentric lifestyle and unreliability on the film set cast him into the black list. It wasn't until the film adaptation of Frank Millers comic Sin City was he welcomed back into the Hollywood circle, and now he delivers another outstanding role as Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson.<br/><br/>Only once has a man been so tortured, brutalized, heartbroken and redeemed as Randy, and that was Jesus, in fact one scene makes a reference to the suffering of Jesus. In the sequence, Randy and his opponent (who mysteriously resembles a Jewish man, please don't hurt me!) undergo the most arduous and raw torture I have ever seen in film. The ring is adorned with barbed wire and glass, The crowd is jeering, there is blood on the ropes, and Randy reaches his breaking point. After leaving the ring a team of medics swarm over him, cleaning his wounds, removing the pieces of wire and glass from his tired and blood drenched skin. The man is broken, and could go no further.<br/><br/>It is after this point that major changes are made in his life. Forced to abandon wrestling for his health, he begins to accept life outside the ring. He takes a full time job at the local supermarket deli (a role so humiliating and close to me that I can really connect with Randy and his position, because nothing sucks more than the deli), rekindles his relationship with his estranged daughter, and and furthers a bond with an aging stripper (an almost unrecognizable Marisa Tomei) with whom he has strong feelings for. However life in retirement creates a gap inside him, and the call of the ring beckons him.<br/><br/>All of those on the screen give outstanding performances, and I will be truly disappointed if they don't all get some recognition from the academy. Marisa's performance of Cassidy is a story happening all over the world. Single mothers having to work in degrading professions to support themselves. Like Randy, she longs for something as well, a new life and a new start for her child. Evan Rachael Wood plays Stephanie, Randy's abandoned daughter. Her character is torn between her hatred of her father leaving her and her commitment as he attempts to reconcile with her.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky is one of my all time favorite directors. His other great project ""Requiem for a Dream"" was another story of hardship, loss and tragedy. However, ""The Wrestler"" gives the audience something more, it gives us a view into the life of a man who believed he was forlorn from the world, but we know that this wasn't true. In one scene with his daughter he talks about his loneliness ""I'm an old broken down piece of meat and I deserve to be all alone, I just don't want you to hate me."" What I can say is this, he was not alone. When he took to the ring, and peered out to the cheering fans surrounding him, he was in a world that accepted him, and he well and truly belonged. 10/10"
"mgayles2005","10","1","2","30 January 2009"," A movie thats powerful, deep, and realistic...and its about something fake...
","It's no secret that professional wrestling is fake, but that's only to a certain extent. It's staged, which means the events in the ring are plotted out in advance. Chairs are smashed across faces, three hundred pound men leap from twenty feet in the air, weapons come from under the mat, and the wrestlers involved never take any permanent damage. Despite the obvious truth about the sport you would never tell a pro wrestler what he does is fake. That's because sport is played by real people who put their lives on the line for their sport. ""The Wrestler"" is all about stripping the illusion away from the sport and showing us a wrestler named Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson, a wrestler ten years past his prime. Randy attempts to keep his glory days of the 80's alive, even at the risk of his own life. Thanks to the script by Robert D. Seigel, the direction of Darren Aronofsky, and the incredible performance of Mickey Rourke, the wrestler becomes so realistic it could be mistaken for a documentary.<br/><br/>Inside the ring Randy is well respected and admired. The younger wrestlers look up to him, seek his advice and encouragement. Outside the ring reality bites: Randy lives in a trailer park and works at a small grocery store to support him. In once scene is rent is late and he is forced to sleep in his trailer. What led him to that point isn't clearly explained but you can figure it out. A many years of self destructive behavior have left his body damaged, along with most of his relationships. We seem him buying steroids before a match. in another scene he abuses cocaine. This leads to a near fatal heart attack that takes him out of wrestling for good.<br/><br/>While out of the game he tries to mend broken fences. He has a daughter he's doesn't know very well. She's grown up to be a lesbian. He does his best to slowly work his way back into her life. His love interest is an aging stripper played by Marissa Tomei. She's also past her prime. She roams the strip club offering lap dances and getting denied numerous times. Who in their right mind would turn down Marissa Tomei? The wrestling scenes are fare more entertaining and insightful then anything in the WWE. Randy hides a razor blade in his pads just so he can make himself bleed at the appropriate moment. There's a brutal match involving glass, nails, barbed wire and a staple gun. Randy and the Necro Butcher (a real life wrestler) puncture each other's skin with a staple gun, and the staples are real. After the match the paramedics pull the staples out.<br/><br/>Without the performance of Mickey Rourke ""The Wrestler"" would not be as authentic as it is. Prior to his role in this film, Rourke had become a joke, a parody of himself. A former pretty boy actor who destroyed his face during his short lived boxing career (I guess he wasn't very good) and tried to fix it with plastic surgery. It was not a very good combination, and it becomes painfully clear in this movie. But the magic forces of life gave the fallen actor a break when Aronofsky told the producers that he didn't want Nicholas Cage, he wanted Mickey. I can't credit him enough for kicking Cage to the curb: A fine actor but not right for the part. Mickey was born to play Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson. He became Randy so convincingly because he is Randy. His performance is dripping with so much authenticity it's hard to tell where Mickey begins and Randy ends. It's the comeback of a lifetime.<br/><br/>The Academy nominated him for best actor, an award he deserves to win. He will win it. While he faces tough competition the other four actors are just playing dress up compared to the performance Mickey displays. Nothing about it feels forced, or fake. You believe he's the character from the first shot and all the way into the last. Marissa Tomei was also nominated for best supporting actress. She also deserved the nod, but not the victory. Why didn't Aronofksy, or Seigel get nominated? Without the realistic writing, and focused direction those two performances would never be. And ""The Wrestler"" as a whole is easily the best movie of 2008. You can't convince everybody, especially the stiffs at the Academy. How ironic that two excellent movies about men in outrageous costumes got snubbed this year√Ç‚Ä¶.I think you know what the other movie is."

","Well it's said the pro wrestling is the male soap opera and this movie can go along those lines. I liked it! It reminded me of Beyond The Mat: Jake The Snake Roberts story, and All The Marbles(A women pro wrestling movie should be next. Now that maybe a little more dramatic). I was shocked at some of things put in the film. I was like ""Wow they put that in there? Okay cool!"" I don't think the Ram was too old to know what Call of Duty 4 was. C'mon now I mean Barrack Obama got a Wii and a Black Berry so WTF? Ram had to be in his forties and video games were around back then, anyway some nice cameos for us pro wrestling fans. ROH had their banner up. Hot current topics like performance enhancers set the tone for the movie. There were some touching scenes like the fan fest that had me at "" damn, that's messed up!"".

","It was so perfect. <br/><br/>It encompassed so much that I feel or have felt in life. Thank you Darron Aronofsky (one of my favorite directors) and Mickey Rourke for discovering that you are a miraculous film-making team. <br/><br/>Rourke's RANDY ""THE RAM"" ROBINSON reminded me of myself, my father, and a star I've idolized for a lifetime, all thrown into a blender and slapped in the face repetitively. He is such a god damn lovable guy, but he's a victim to his life. Behind all his power, he is helpless, just like so many people. He is who he is and there's no one else he can be.<br/><br/>I was highly engaged and entertained the entire time, and was dropping tears, one at a time, sparingly throughout the entire second half of the film.<br/><br/>I was also astonished by Marisa Tomei. Not just by her mind-blowing 44 year old body (which I was not expecting to be so floored by), but just as much by her performance as the admirable stripper. There are plenty of good people out there who take on this rough profession and she plays one of them, with flying colors. She was working magic in this film and I felt like I tied to the same string that Rourke's character was tied to. She was lovable and powerful.<br/><br/>The wrestling matches in the early portion of the film are brutal, intense, and realistic. Honestly they are some of the best ""action sequences"" I have seen all year. They will certainly change your perspective on the sport if you aren't already a fan.

","I am no fan of American style wrestling, yet this superb tale of an ageing, fading wrestler is a triumph. Lead, Mickey Rourke as Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson delivers a career defining performance of pathos and power. The wrestling scenes are visceral and blood soaked, and the supporting cast consistently excel, however brief ""their moment"". Reputedly shot for under $7m, it does not have a low budget feel to it, proving once again that fine acting and a good script beat dollars and CGI. The dressing room and ""backstage"" shots feature working wrestlers adding to the authenticity of the film.<br/><br/>The lead story of ""The Ram's"" demise is mirrored by the supporting sub plot of lap dancer Cassidy, who also ""sells"" her flesh with time running out on her. Well played by the marvellous Marisa Tomei, who at 44, still has a body to be proud of, the part is underwritten and neatly contrasts with the hell-bound ""Ram"".Evan Rachel Wood plays a thoughtful cameo as Stephanie,Randy's estranged daughter, providing the film's most poignant scene as her father takes her to visit a childhood seaside haunt to reminisce and build bridges.<br/><br/>""Raw"" most accurately defines the films ambiance, whether it is the bruised and broken flesh of the ring, Randy's explicit ""tail-gunning"" of a good time girl when he should have his mind on taking his daughter out for dinner, or his plaintiff desperation at pursuing the only thing he knows, wrestling, against the odds. It is rumoured that Nicholas Cage was screen tested for this role, which is odd, because it reprises some of the themes of Cage's role in ""Leaving Las Vegas"". The headlong crash to destruction, the ""tart with a heart"" and a worthy script feature in both. A carefully chosen soundtrack ably underpins the proceedings, although Bruce Springsteen's custom written ""The Wrestler"" is absurdly tossed away with the credits rather than interwoven into the story.<br/><br/>My only real concern is where the audience is for this. The young and pre- teenage audience, the bedrock fans of wrestling are excluded by its certification. And the casual adult audience may not be attracted by the ostensibly ""uncool"" subject matter. That would be a shame, as a sophisticated audience will appreciate the Shakespearian Tragedy of the plot, and Rourke's finest two hours."

","This is a simple story, a snapshot of the tail end of a wrestlers life. Anyone who has ever seen wrestling comes to know that it is entertainment, but to deny the punishment that wrestlers take by calling it fake is a disservice. I grew up in the wrestling heartland of Alberta Canada where the likes of the Chris Benoit, the Hart brothers, Davey Boy Smith and the Dynamite Kid, Andre the Giant and countless others plied their trade. I watched them religiously as a kid and heard countless stories of the gypsy like existence of these performers, touring in vans, driving from one small town to the next, putting on the show.<br/><br/>This film is simply gripping, driven by Mickey Rourke's heartfelt performance. He captures the rugged toughness of a wrestler and gives us a glimpse at the heart of a man clinging to glory as age and hard living rob him of his vitality. The story is simple and its simplicity makes it all the more powerful. The recent deaths of many of the wrestling heroes of my youth have given me plenty to think about and this film adds a little bit more.<br/><br/>The Wrestler is a picture of the human side of a hero, with character flaws and plenty of scars, superbly acted and directed, a must see for any fan of wrestling or anyone who wants a glimpse of a wrestlers life. It also gets my vote for the best movie of 2008."

","I have never, ever been so taken with a film. I went with two friends, luckily close ones, as I cried like a child through a good third of the film. All those situations, from the trying to connect with the girl in the strip club, the estranged relationships, the wanting to change but just not remotely being able to, the heartbreak, the poverty, seeing the world change and not being able to keep up, ... from my limited experience this film was ruthlessly authentic to the nth degree. Astonishing film, I can't imagine seeing a greater, more realistic film. If, as we are told, god came down as Jesus to try and see life from our perspective, I recommend He view this film and see how it really is today."
"tpmanbmw","10","1","2","17 January 2009"," What a performance
","I grew up as a wrestling fan, often times embarrassed because I was simply watching a bunch of men in tights. However after seeing The Wrestler earlier today, I have gained a new found respect for the wrestling industry. Mickey Rourke's performance is one of legend which captures the true essence of a professional wrestler. For every Hulk Hogan, The Rock, Ric Flair, and Triple H there's 100s who have sacrificed their bodies and psychological capacities for the love of the fans and the adrenaline rush from the exposure. If you look at the gigantic list of wrestlers under the age of 50 that have died, it truly makes you look at how harmful the sport really is. It will be hard for me to watch wrestling again after seeing this movie, because of the destruction that these men put towards their bodies with the in-ring punishment and the outside the ring steroid use. But I thought the director did a masterful job of showing the parallels in the sacrificing of one's personal life to either wrestler or strip. I would have like to seen a bit more interaction on the similarities of the two professions, however, I still thought the movie was very well done. I though the ending was perfect, because is there any other ending more fitting than a sad one. A few years removed from the Chris Benoit situation and nearly a decade after Owen Hart's in-ring death, this was the perfect time to release this emotional film which encompassed the psychological feelings of wrestlers, the connection with the fans, and the demons that come with being on the road. Not only does Mickey Rourke deserve an Oscar, but this movie deserves Best Picture. I think it should be between this and Slumdog Millionaire because they are the movies that truly allowed you to experience the character's feelings and you feel with them through their connections. But more importantly than the awards, I hope that this film sends the message to the the WWE that an after-retirement program is needed including Health Insurance, Pension, and Psychological Services; not to mention regulation on performance enhancers, amphetamines, and painkillers."

He doesn't leave it for a millisecond that I could see.<br/><br/>Actually, both the character and the role seemed consumed by the very act of witnessing the depth of the actor's characterization.<br/><br/>The only aspect of the movie that was unbelievable was the idea that he could let go and make a 'better' life for himself. At least a healthier one. But that was intended to be unbelievable, to seem unachievable for him, even in the midst of the attempt.<br/><br/>Any person who deliberately (on inescapably) puts something they do ahead of Everything else because it simply seems to be the only thing they're fit to do here, is dragged along with the magnificent inevitable surrender, the being completely lost in what they are doing, that Rourke shows.<br/><br/>To watch his eyes and hear his voice inside that face and body, it's chilling. And exhilarating. Almost a testament to the survival of the soul.<br/><br/>To watch him here is to see echos of him in Angel Heart.<br/><br/>It is 100% fitting and proper that such characters (or people) should die while doing the only thing they really feel fit to do here.<br/><br/>Whether or not we live this way, we all dream of living (and dying) this way.<br/><br/>Whether or not we admit it, we still all dream it.<br/><br/>Whether or not we remember the dreams, we all have them."

","Mickey Rourke's performance in this film absolutely deserved the Golden Globe he was awarded Sunday night. He was this broken down wrestler. His character is so touching and sad, you just want to take him home and tell him everything is going to be okay.<br/><br/>From the opening scene until the end, you heart is breaking for this man who obviously has seen better days. I have heard Rourke say in interviews that he could relate to the character he was playing.<br/><br/>Rourke was the bad boy of Hollywood who gave killer performances in Barfly and 9 and 1/2 Weeks. Then poof... he was gone. I don't read the tabloids, but always wondered what happened to him. And now I wonder if he ended up living in a trailer or some rat trap off Hollywood Blvd.<br/><br/>Rourke thanked his dogs in his acceptance speech. He said they were the only friends he had for a long time. Must have been horrible to live on the fringe of Hollywood when you were once in the spotlight.<br/><br/>Marisa Tomei plays an old stripper with a heart of gold. Tomei character seems to mirror Rourke's in terms of the stage they seemingly love to be on and the cold reality staring them both in the face. Their days on stage are numbered.<br/><br/>Rourke tries to reconnect with his estranged daughter played by Evan Rachel Wood. She plays her part perfectly. The scenes with the two of them are exactly what it might be like for the abandoned daughter and the guilt-ridden absent father trying to make amends.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky directs this film. While trying to get financing, Aronofsky was turned down left and right with Rourke in the lead. Aronofsky made the film on a very low budget. Seven million is what I heard. I am glad he kept Rourke in the lead. A very good call.<br/><br/>Robert D. Siegel wrote this screenplay. I do not know anything about this writer, but wonder if he is an old wrestler. Or maybe he lived next door to an old wrestler in some trailer park in Anytown, USA. If not, he did one hell of a job with his research.<br/><br/>Without giving the film away, I just want to say that I love when we are shown Rourke's character, Randy the Ram, fiddling with his hearing aid, playing video games with neighbor kids in his trailer, and when he is working at the deli. His interaction with the customers are priceless.<br/><br/>Also love when he is at a convention of sorts where wrestler's are signing autographs. Rourke is in a room with other old wrestlers. At one point he looks down the leg of one guy and sees his urine bag sticking out of his pant leg. Made me weep.<br/><br/>I am torn between three stellar performances this year for the upcoming award season; Mickey Rourke, Sean Penn, and Frank Langella. Although all performances are great, I think I want Rourke to win. Rourke's career desperately needs a win for the SAG and Academy Awards.<br/><br/>Sean Penn and Frank Langella will continue to work until the day they die if they want. However, Rourke may end up on the fringe again when he deserves the spotlight. This man is a truly talented artist and deserves our forgiveness for whatever he did. Everybody deserves a second chance.<br/><br/>One last thing, Bruce Springsteen said in his acceptance speech at the Golden Globe Awards for best song that Rourke called asking if he might do the song for the film. Rourke briefly described the character to Springsteen. Springsteen said, ""I know guys like that."" I have always loved Bruce Springsteen. And love him more for doing the song for this film. Bet he did it for peanuts too. Guess Springsteen also believes everybody deserves a second chance.<br/><br/>Posted by Mary Cuevas"

In my opinion the heartbreaking story of Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson is not only the best movie of the year but one of the best movies I've seen in a while.<br/><br/>Mickey Rourke does a fantastic job at playing the aging superstar throughout the film and his performance is one of his finest to date. His scenes with his daughter (Evan Rachel Wood) are some of the saddest scenes ever put to film and I challenge anybody who sees the film to not be moved by them. Rourke's interactions with the stripper Cassidy (Marisa Tomei) are great as well. From their friendly interactions at Cassidy's place of business to their last interaction together, you feel a genuine connection between the two.<br/><br/>Aronofsky proves to us again that he is one of the best directors out their with his latest film and I can't wait to see what else the man has to offer us. The song by Bruce Springsteen is ace as well and fits perfectly with the tone of the picture and I can't imagine anyone else doing the song besides The Boss himself. <br/><br/>Rourke and Springsteen already earned Golden Globes for their contributions, here's to hoping this film does even better when the Oscars roll around..."

","Most reviews discuss this movie as a plot and performances. But I experienced it as a metaphor, almost as though someone said, ""Let's make a movie based on Thoreau's 'The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation,' but make it contemporary and gutty-engrossing.<br/><br/>There's no real back story, beyond ""20 years ago this guy was a famous wrestler,"" and ""this guy is estranged from his daughter because basically he was an absent jerk-of-a-father,"" and ""this pitiful guy lives in a ghastly trailer and is even locked out of that because he can't pay the rent."" Just those bare bones allow the viewer to create a huge past, knowing The Ram lives his life focused on former glory while unconscious to, but skirting with, the reality that it was built on mountains of detritus from his sacrificed life. He is a Gladiator in a very Roman sense. He is a prisoner and both a real and symbolic sacrificial figure, mired in an arena where pain has wedded fame. And though he is still stuck, he's over the hill in absolutely every way.<br/><br/>When he suffers a heart attack and has a by-pass, which creates a permanent side-line of ""you may no longer be The Wrestler,"" the viewer already knows he will enter the ring again. This is a man who has lived a life filled with choices, as every man has, and you realize that he has made the wrong choice at every turn. Now his life has narrowed to a desperate parody of former fame. He's a has-been who barely ever was, he knows it, he lives it, it oozes out of every pore, his emotional agony resonates in his every pain-wracked breath. He's an excruciating example of ""you reap what you sow"" and that is what makes this film universal, not unlike ""A Christmas Carol."" Roarke's extraordinary performance captures you from the beginning, drawing you into his world, which is haunted by lost dreams from which he can't escape, humiliations which have piled so high he can no longer be anything but humble and wry, yet he bulls on, shooting up steroids, washing down pain-killers, both of which are again metaphors for his loss of power and his tortured soul.<br/><br/>He's a gentle, narcissistic man who has focused his entire will on being The Ram, a huge physical presence of strength and power. But his real name is Robin and the sweet, vulnerable bird inside him has few feathers left. He's human, aging, desperately alone, wants love, to be connected, to on some level be a part of the regular world. In this way, he is no different from any addict or alcoholic or workaholic or actor/fame-seeker wanna-be, anybody who has wandered down a path of Self that is destructive and filled with denial. He is Every Failed Man times twelve.<br/><br/>The sorrow of the film is palpable. It is sublime in its realization. Mickey Rourke is genius."
"anjru","9","1","2","11 January 2009"," Sweet Child of Mine by Andrew Malekoff
","The Wrestler is a heart wrenching tale of a professional wrester - Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson - who thrives on the adulation of the masses and at the great expense of having any intimate relationships in his life. ""The Ram's"" body gradually betrays him, one organ at a time, after years of battering, abuse and reliance on chemical enhancements and pain killers. Bypass surgery is one consequence. But this physical repair that reminds him of his mortality cannot mend his broken and lonely heart. Mickey Rourke plays a tragic figure who does not exhibit even one drop of self pity, despite his deep and openly expressed sadness. He makes one futile attempt after another to establish an intimate connection in his life. Ultimately though, he goes back to the nonsustaining well of wrestling fans who love only the persona and not the person. Although in a few fleeting scenes with children we see that there is an intuitive connection that reaches beyond empty action figure idealization. Kids really love him and he loves them back. Rourke and Marissa Tomei as an aging stripper are captivating. And, they are touching in all of their scenes together, as are Rourke and Evan Rachel Wood who plays his abandoned daughter. The supporting cast of fellow wrestlers and children that adore ""The Ram"" all help to bring forth the humanity and sweetness inside of the gladiator. A few of the scenes with Randy working in a deli, wearing a hairnet and interacting with customers from behind the counter, are classic. Guns and Roses' Sweet Child of Mine is the perfect song for ""The Ram's"" entrance into the squared circle for his grand finale against his nemesis, the Ayatollah. I highly recommend this film. It stays with you and gets under your skin long after the credits role to Bruce Springstein crooning."

With a daughter who hates him and a bad day job, Randy handles his life outside wrestling while dealing with his deteriorating health.<br/><br/>The movie deals with real human drama about relationships, the personal problems faced by a glossy wrestler and how his real life is anything but. From daughter issues to love life to fulfilling fan expectations, the screenplay tackles these with brilliance and provides insight into an athlete's life. The ending is especially powerful and nails the theme of the movie into the ground.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky does a great job directing the movie. The camera looks raw and the angles follow Rourke around, which helps look into the minute details of his life. The matches are professionally shot, and add to the glamor of the sport.<br/><br/>The real gem here is the knockout performance of Mickey Rourke.

"PWNYCNY","10","1","2","10 January 2009"," Wrestling is fake ... or is it? Mickey Rourke gives an incredible performance.
","Not since Requiem for A Heavyweight has Hollywood produced a more intense movie in the sports genre. A beat up, over-the-hill wrestler portrayed as a hero who finds purpose and redemption in what he does best. Mickey Rourke gives one of the great performances in the sports' movie genre. His performance as the wrestler ranks up there with John Garfield's performance as Charlie Davis in Body and Soul and Robert DeNiro's performance as Jake LaMotta in Raging Bull. In some respects Mr. Rourke's performance exceeds that of the aforementioned actors. In addition, kudos to Marisa Tomei's powerful performance as a stripper who befriends the wrestler. What makes this movie even more impressive is that it avoids becoming another sappy Hollywood melodrama and instead stays true to the story, which is about the wrestler. After watching this movie, one may come away with a different impression of professional wrestling. Not a mere bunch of overgrown clowns who make fools of themselves, in this movie they are portrayed with dignity and as performers who do difficult and dangerous work. This movie is wonderful. Congratulations to Mickey Rourke and Marisa Tomei for a job well done.<br/><br/>This movie also provides a respectful and sympathetic portrayal of deli countermen, those unsung workers who toil behind the counters at delis, bagel shops, bodegas and supermarkets. How often is a deli counterman the subject of anything, much less a motion picture? After watching this movie you will have a greater understanding and respect for those hardworking fellows, taken for granted, who toast the bread and slice the meat for a hungry public. Indeed, this movie is actually a tribute to working-class people who, like the wrestler, toil to earn a living."
"Sinisstarfreak17","9","1","2","7 January 2009"," welcome back Mickey Rourke!
","Ladies And Gentlemen..Please welcome Mickey Rourke back to acting. After a 4-5 year hiatus, i believe the last movie he did was either Domino or Sin City.. Mickey Rourke returns from his washed up life and decides to act again. And he returns with the perfect role for him.<br/><br/>The Wrestler starts off showing pictures and background announcements on a match in 1989. It is Madison Square Garden and the place is sold out. You can hear the crowd chanting for Randy, The place is going crazy. 1, 2, 3....and then you are brought to a man sitting in a chair 20 years later. The man is Randy. Randy is now a washed up wrestler. He is now on the Indy Circuit touring with small crowds of maybe 100 seats and working above people just getting into the profession. The other men look up to him, and he is still a role model. The crowd still loves him. He may only make 100 dollars or so for a match on the weekend, but this does not seem to bother him.<br/><br/>After the first 10 or so minutes and the first match, it gets into the real story of the film. Randy's Life. He goes home to a Trailer which is locked because the tenant has not received the rent and Randy ends up sleeping in his van which appears nothing new to him. He has a weekday job of bringing in shipments for a grocery store and he spends all of his money on steroids and a stripper at a club.<br/><br/>This is where i found the movie to get real interesting. The Stripper Cassidy, played by Marisa Tomei, her life seems exactly like Randy's only in a different profession. When we are first introduced to her character she is being shot down by a group or 20 year olds who say they wanted a different girl and she is way to old for them. Randy helps her out and we see the chemistry between the two. She will become an important character throughout the film.<br/><br/>Randy has another match this time it being a Hardcore match. After the hardcore match he has a heart attack where the doctor tells him he can no longer Wrestle. No Longer Wrestle, Are you joking? That is all Randy knows, that is what he lives for. Now it is time to apparently turn his life around. He asks for more hours at the grocery store, His boss tells him all that is open is working at the Deli and he takes it. There are some interesting scenes with him working in the Deli interacting with shoppers. He sees his daughter who he has not seen in ages and tries to rekindle things. The relationship is sort of rekindled and will later become a big part of the ending. I can not really say more about the relationship between Cassidy and Randy and his daughter because they both play a big importance in the end of the film.<br/><br/>THE WRESTLER is only the name of the movie. The movie is not all about that. Do not deny to see this movie because you do not like wrestling. Wrestling is only on screen for maybe 15 minutes. Its about the characters in the film and the way they live their lives. One very short but noted performance came from Evan Rachel Wood, who though only on screen for 10 or so minutes steals the camera when she is on it.<br/><br/>I would give this movie 8 out of 10 It was Solid, i really felt the characters stories and as a wrestler fan, to see some of the tricks and behind the scenes stuff of the movie was interesting. Mickey Rourke does deserve an Oscar Nomination. All the cuts and blood you see in the movie is in fact his. That is how committed to the role he was and to see a real movie directed by Daron Aronofsky where its about the characters and just a life story rather then a movie to mess with your mind. It was a nice break and really enjoyable.<br/><br/>If this movie does come to theatres in our area any time soon i recommend seeing it."
"intelearts","10","1","2","6 January 2009"," Powerful indeed
","The Wrestler works. It is first and foremost a straight-out tale of a man who has seen his glory days, and in powerful performances from the Rourke and Tomei we really do get two of the most satisfying performances of the year.<br/><br/>Shot in a gritty realistic way, it plays on the Eighties with its dreams of economic forevers versus the cold reality of 2008, on fame, fortune, and even Lady Luck. Here, we have a man who did one thing really well, and just kept on going way past his sell-by date - yet he is heroic for it.<br/><br/>What is impressive is that the characters have real lives and real depth - when Rourke is kind to kids or living it up or losing his cool in his other job it looks and feels immensely right. This is beyond method acting - it really is deeply if strangely honest. I totally bought the film, and Rourke can wrestle for real, and Tomei's dancer is just brilliant in her desperation and self-awareness - heartbreaking.<br/><br/>The myth of Rourke himself is a strange one but you can't watch this and separate out the two. He has, despite what the myths would have us believe, never stopped working. He has made a film or two every year since the 80s but they generally were barely passable.<br/><br/>He certainly takes the prize for the films he rejected. This from Wikipedia: ""He is alleged to have turned down a number of high-profile acting roles, including Eliot Ness in The Untouchables, Axel Foley in Beverly Hills Cop, Jack Crawford in The Silence of the Lambs, Tom Cruise's role in Rain Man, Nick Nolte's part in 48 Hrs., Christopher Lambert's part in Highlander and a part in Platoon. In a documentary on the special edition DVD of Tombstone, actor Michael Biehn, who plays the part of Johnny Ringo, mentions that his role was first offered to Rourke."" <br/><br/>Here, he, Marisa Tomei, and Aaron Aronofsky are triumphant.<br/><br/>It is kind of a hymn to blue collar values, and strangely enough it's also about how we stand by our values - even if it costs us a lot - whatever we have decided those values might be.<br/><br/>Easily watchable - if full-on in the wrestling scenes - it lingered with us for days after and we found ourselves talking about it a lot.<br/><br/>Mesmerizing and very good, definitely Awards-time good performances and production, this is 100% Rourke's best performance ever.<br/><br/>This parable of modern America is powerful and carries a real punch - go see!"

","A deeply moving film that tugs your emotional heartstrings in all the right places, The Wrestler is as real as you can get, its honest to the core and absolutely no BS. Aronofsky told us a story and he told it at flaming speed. Coupled with great set design and amazing cinematography (I just can't get enough of those over the shoulder shots), The Wrestler is a defining moment in 2008 cinema and it is gonna be remembered for the years to come.<br/><br/>I know its all said and done, but Mickey Rourke gives a career defining performance as Randy ""The Ram"". Rourke is Ram, there can be no other actor who can portray the character like Rourke did. The Ram reflects Rourke's real life struggles and he puts it to good use by using his raw, unnerved emotions on-screen. Tomei also knocked it out the ballpark portraying a sullen, single mom working as a stripper at a nightclub. The spark between her and Rourke is just pure magic but with a depressing mix to the equation when you realize these are people who are in the twilight of their careers and they have nobody else to turn to but each other. Evan Rachel Wood plays the daughter and although she is only seen in a couple or so scenes, she makes up for it with great acting and no doubt, this stunning lady is going places. Aronofsky, known for his previous depressing and sad films, gives us another one to cry our hearts out on so if you still haven't seen the film, ready your Kleenex because the ending will be one for the books.<br/><br/>A must see."
"aharmas","10","1","2","4 January 2009"," A Wounded Hero
","This statement is almost contradictory, but it truly reflects how many will perceive the lead man in ""The Wrestler"": It is a lovely film. It is lovely because it acknowledges the good in most of us, even those who look, act, or are different. The people who inhabit the world of ""The Wrestler"" are faded shadows of people with incredible potential and missed opportunities. What is admirable about them is their ability to keep going, to survive, to continue fighting for hope and love in the middle of their damaged world.<br/><br/>At the center of this dark and miserable world is Rourke's broken wrestler, a person who is hurting both inside and outside, a character fully developed who has punished himself in such a way he's now pain the consequences, and it is as hellish an existence as we have ever seen. He has gotten to the end of a life where he can't find admiration, support, love, or even a simple moment when there is not a painful reminder that is life is failure. Watching Rourke in the fight scenes Ia almost a torture because of the way each blow, each injury, each close up reveals how new and old injuries have been created.<br/><br/>The director also takes us inside his soul and doesn't pull back as we learn, experience, and suffer his frustration at his unsuccessful attempts to reconcile with his daughter (Even Rachel Wood) in a superb performance. Most touching are his several scenes with Marissa Tomei, another hurting survivor who has learned to keep going by isolating herself emotionally from anyone who can be a potential source for more emotional disappointment. Tomei's stripper is tough, sweet, still confused, and unsure of what her perspective about dreaming again might be.<br/><br/>The most amazing revelation is Rourke's broken man, a character who should be all accounts quit, give up, stop trying to breathe as he discovers that nothing in this world seems to work in his favor, but he keeps going, limping, gasping for oxygen, pushing a heart that threatens to destroy the possibility of a new day. He looks around, looking at the daily reminders of his pathetic life, and he forges ahead, hoping something will work out today or tomorrow.<br/><br/>He gives an inspiring performance, and as the screen goes blank before the closing credit, takes on a soaring trip into a place where anything might be possible, and yet there is always the disturbing wake up call that kills our hopes again. It is a breathtaking and painful film to watch, but we must treasure it because it shows how strong we can be when facing darkness."
"come2whereimfrom","9","1","2","4 January 2009"," An amazing piece of storytelling.
","So you have probably heard everyone talking about how this is the resurrection of Rourke's career (wasn't that 'Sin City'?) or the fact that the main characters life parallels his own, how its an amazing piece of casting or how it's a return to form for Aronofsky after the impressive but distinctly crazy 'Fountain'. Well all the above is true, the film and its director and the cast all deserve the praise lavished upon them because the film is just that good. So, I hear you cry, will I like it if I'm not particularly a fan of wrestling, well put simply yes, the story and the character are universal they just happen to be set in the world of the sport but could quite easily have been set anywhere. It's a real life lesson, any of us that have ever messed up no matter how big or small will be able to relate in someway. Rourke plays Randy 'the Ram' Robinson a star who has somewhat slipped from grace with his fans and family alike and the story follows him as he tries desperately to inject some normality into his life but his unflinching approach to his waning stardom and his dreams of a better future only go so far and its within his heartfelt fall that the story grips you like a wrestle hold. Shot beautifully, great soundtrack, amazing supporting cast all helps but it is Rourke's film as his bleach blonde battered and bruised persona fills the screen lighting up every scene. You will find yourself rooting for the underdog, shouting at the screen at his choices and feeling hopelessly sorry for him as he moves through the superbly paced tale of highs and lows. It is filled with genuine human emotion that will sit uneasily in all of us, it will make you start to think how different your life could have been if only you had made a different choice at certain points, it will make you remember when you have been at your happiest and when you have been at the very bottom with seemingly no way out, it captures a moment that lasts for all time. I cannot stress how much I absolutely loved this film because as a film fan it ticked so many boxes and any left were ticked just because I'm human. Films this good don't come around very often so whatever you do get yourself ringside seats for 'The Wrestler' any be prepared to be knocked out."
"sioenroux","8","1","2","31 December 2008"," A wonderful study in desperation
","First, let me join the chorus and say Mickey Rourke is a treat here. Wow does he look different, and it helps him fully inhabit this character: A run-down, washed-up, mostly broken former pro wrestling star. Marisa Tomei plays a similarly past-her-prime stripper, also carrying some baggage.<br/><br/>Together, these two characters inhabit a beautifully grim world, painted by Darren Aronofsky in the pallid tones of desperation he used so perfectly in ""Requiem for A Dream."" There is no redemption here, just the fumbling about of people destined to the second-tier heap of humanity.<br/><br/>If I make it sound too much of a downer, rest assured the script doesn't let it become depressing. A light touch and bits of humor (playing a wrestling video game against Rourke, a pre-teen neighborhood boy cracks you up when he utters under his breath, ""This game's so OLD"") keep the story engaging and entertaining.<br/><br/>I almost ended up rooting for these people, if only because they seem to be trying so hard. In the end, though, this movie packed nearly the same punch as ""Requiem"": When you're on the wrong side of your fate, there might be some fading glory, but there is no way out."

","I stood in line for three hours at the rush line hoping that there would be empty seats for the North American premiere of The Wrestler. By the time I got into the theater I was just glad to have sat down. Then Aronofsky walked on stage to introduce his film and I was back on my feet again, clapping as loud as I can. He was friendly, funny and at first sounded humble when he explained to the audience that the film would in no way live up to the hype the audience had just created since the theater was just recently filled with non stop applaud for what seemed to be twenty minutes. He told us that we were going to be disappointed and we all thought he was joking or being humble, but we were wrong. The Wrestler tries to stay away from the clich√©s of sports films, but by the end of the film you are left with a watered down version of Rocky Balboa (2006 film) without the training montage.<br/><br/>The jokes in the film were lackluster, dull one-liners, as was most of the script.Evan Rachel Wood brought absolutely NOTHING to this film. The film takes about twenty minutes screen time going through how wrestling is fake, but people do get hurt, and they do bleed, while performing stunts. And by the end of the film you are like I already knew that wrestling was fake, but who really cares about how they get it done and you are left thinking about how empty this film was. <br/><br/>The film is about Rourke's character a washed up wrestler who is dealing with life after being on top, the issues of being alone, finding someone to love, trying to patch things with his estranged daughter, and finding the strength and courage to fight his last match (20 years in the making). I can see that he has a tough life, and has to sleep in his van at times, patches his coat with duct tape, spends most of his money on performance enhancing drugs, strippers and booze. But this doesn't make you pity Rourke's character, you just feel like he is an idiot and this is all his fault. If Rourke did not have such a lovable personality this film would not have worked at all. The two other sub stories of his daughter and stripper are both clich√©d and you don't really care for them or their stories. The final match that the film is supposed to be leading to, Rourke's last match, there is almost no build up to it and there is really no climax either. The film will probably be dubbed as the best wrestling film thus far created, but that doesn't say much. There are only a handful of wrestling films, what are you going to compare it to? No Holds Barred, Ready to Rumble or Nacho Libre? Aronofsky is a very talented director and it feels like he just coasted through this film. The film was definitely not hard to direct, there was no complex characters, shots or scenery. It looked like a made for TV film, no wonder he didn't find a North American distributor. Aside from everything that was horrible about the film I do have to mention that Rourke was not bad. I liked his tired/nostalgic character who didn't complain, but try to live with his mistakes. He gave one of his best performances in a long time, but that doesn't say much cause Rourke is not a great actor and he will in no way collect an Oscar for this. <br/><br/>Everybody in the audience laughed at all the jokes and clapped very enthusiastically at the end of the film, and I was like what is going on, is everybody here retarded? I turned to my left and found one of my friends clapping along with the audience and I asked him if he liked the film and he shook his head to say no and kept clapping. I still can't understand the ovation. I would give the film a 6 out of 10 because I really like Arnofsky. The film will probably take in 25 or 30 million max, when they find a distributor and I say when because its only a matter of time the studios realize that there is a large wrestling fan base (WWE) and this will probably be like Pulp Fiction to them, (keeping in mind the only other wrestling films that made it to theaters were Ready to Rumble and Nacho Libre otherwise I would not compare this film to Pulp Fiction unless I was talking about how much better Pulp Fiction is). <br/><br/>I hoped that Arnofsky would be taking questions after the film, but he hastily left. I wanted to ask him what the hell happened. Aronofsky is, or now was by far one of my favorite directors. Pi was amazing and actually inspired me to make a low budget film to get myself out there. Requiem for a Dream and the Fountain (which is my second favorite film of all time) were also just as groundbreaking even though the Fountain wasn't as well received as it should have been, probably because it was too complex for the general public, but The Wrester? Come on! What made him make this movie? Did he feel that he was obligated to make a mainstream film after the box office failure of the Fountain? I guess directors have to pay property taxes too. But instead of complaining I should also be thanking Arnofsky because when I left to theater I was motivated to start writing again and pick up on my script, because if a talented director like Arnofsky can pick a horrible script like The Wrestler and put it on film, I am sure I can get some of my thoughts and ideas onto the silver screen."

","I've never liked professional wrestling, and I don't think much of Mickey Rourke. Despite all the hoopla, I found this film not very artful, perhaps because I found it disagreeable. Rourke is somewhat plausible as a ""has been,"" because that's what he is. Marisa Tomei is a reasonably good actress but I was not enchanted watching her do pole dances and lap dances in her birthday suit (save for an absolute minimum of covering). Evan Rachel Wood does a nice job as the alienated daughter of Rourke's character, Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson. Forget Randy ""The Ram,"" however. If I were related to Mickey Rourke himself, I'd be alienated. There is nothing in the least attractive about his character or about him. I can't imagine why he or the film won ANY honors."

","I'm not an Aronofsky fan, but I went to this, I hope, with an open mind. First, I think the critics have focused on the wrong performance; Marisa Tormei walked away with this film as far as I was concerned. O'Rourke is a great actor, but there was something calculated and obvious both in the conception of the role and the performance. Everyone seemed to forget Evan Rachel Wood and her character were in this movie (which really was a disappointment; she shines in what little she has to do here).<br/><br/>As a metaphor for America's spiritually bankrupt, ""U-S-A!"" chantin', hero/celebrity oriented, Muslim fearin', self-loathing, economically dying culture, I suppose this has value. But I'm guessin' not many in the audience latch onto that. Instead, Aronofsky's need to alienate his audience with despair, gore, and ugliness is stripped bare of his usual excess with cinematic ""tricks."" Glad for latter anyway.<br/><br/>I mean, didn't anyone involved in this see ""Rocky?"" ""Rocky II?"" ""Rocky III?"" ""Rocky IV?"" ""Rocky V""...?"
"Michael_Elliott","Null","2","7","25 January 2009"," Masterpiece
","Wrestler, The (2008) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Heartbreaking drama about a worn out, broken down wrestler (Mickey Rourke) who suffers a heart attack and is forced to retire from the only thing he knows. Desperate and alone he tries to start up a relationship with a stripper (Marisa Tomei) and tries to reconnect with the daughter (Evan Rachel Wood) he turned his back on years earlier. Expectations are a very funny thing because I walked into this movie expecting a great performance by Rourke but in a decent movie with a subject we've seen countless times before. Those were my expectations but I walked out of the theater as if I had been born again but not too many movies have ever hit me as hard as this one. It's certainly takes my top spot for the best movie of 2008 but, and I hate jumping to conclusions, it also manages to be one of the best I've seen. Yes, I hate throwing praise on a new movie because only time will tell how much it holds up but again, I've never really walked out of a movie like I did here. I was emotionally worn out, emotionally heartbroken and I couldn't get my mind off of Randy 'The Ram' Robinson, Rourke's broken down character. We've seen movies before about losers wanting to get one more chance but never quite like this one and a lot of that credit has to go to Rourke but also Aronofsky's brilliant screenplay and direction.<br/><br/>As for Rourke, this is much more than just a comeback performance because I'd go even further in saying that this is a performance for all time. Again, I expected a great performance going into the film because of all the hype around it but I never expected how brilliant and touching he would be. Rourke's performance has the ability to break your heart with a simple smile or frown. As soon as Rourke walks on the screen you see him as this character, warts and all. His character is ugly, his life his ugly yet you can't help but put him in your heart and care for his future. There's a scene where Rourke begins to tell his highlights to the stripper and we see how pathetic he is. There's a scene where he tries to reconnect with his daughter and we see him desperation. We get a charming scene of him trying a new job when he thinks his life is about to change and we smile because we hope something good is about to happen. Rourke is so magnificent in this film that it's very hard to believe you're watching an actor and not a real person.<br/><br/>As much praise as Rourke is rightfully getting, much praise has to go to the supporting women in the film. Tomei has always been underrated and has delivered a nice career since picking up an Oscar for My Cousin Vinny. As with Rourke, the screenplay allows Tomei to jump into this character and we get to see her ugliness as well as her desperation. Basically we have two characters hoping for something better yet both seem to realize that they are who they are and perhaps life isn't going to give them any breaks. Seeing the two of them working together was like listening to beautiful music because to two play so well off of each others characters. Even Rachel Wood is one I haven't seen too much of and she only has a few scenes here but she too is very impressive. The rage and anger she displays is mighty emotional and hard hitting.<br/><br/>I'm sure the title is going to keep some people away because they'll say they don't want to watch a movie about a wrestler but that's a shame. Calling this a wrestling picture would be like saying The Shawshank Redemption was nothing but a prison picture or that Rocky was nothing more than a boxing movie. The subject really doesn't matter because of the heart of the story is with its characters and I really hope people will walk into this movie. I'm not much of a fan of wrestling but I must admit that I've gained a lot more respect for them after watching this movie. Having known that the fights were staged and fixed, I never really payed them no credit but after watching this movie and the abuse they take they have my highest respect. They also have my deepest sadness for how many of their lives end up.<br/><br/>In closing, perhaps the movie won't hit people like it did me. Perhaps this is just one of those movies that a person connects with on so many levels that it's rather scary. I don't think there's any debate about Rourke's performance as he's being praised left and right but to me this movie is so much more than just a comeback picture. The balls of this film and its main character are probably a lot like the real life of Rourke and perhaps that's where some of the magic comes from. Whatever the reason, and I hate to sound melodramatic, this film hit me like very few do. Even if someone doesn't get hit as hard as I did, I'm sure people will at least respect this fine film."

Lots of very beefy half naked guys running around groping each other, for the rest of you... well this movie is about a washed up pro-wrestler. Really, he's washed up, he's not smart, or funny or anything interesting, he's just some desperate washed up old man and I found it hard to relate to someone so stupid. He's hard to feel sorry for because, well, the things he does are just so stupid you feel he deserves what he gets.<br/><br/>The lack of empathy for the main character does not negate how depressing the movie is. Also, don't watch this movie if you still think pro wrestling is real.(hahahahahah) This movie is also done in the style of ""amature camera"" as seen an many documentaries, this would normally work, but the main character is so depth-less that this just seems like a cheap ploy for attention.<br/><br/>Finally, this movie has a strange hypnotic effect on people who are interested or were interested in pro-wrestling. My boyfriend liked it, and he hates everything. So like I said if you are a pro-wrestling fan you will probably somehow like this movie... otherwise stay away, stay far away."

","I enjoyed Aronofsky's other work too, but I will always consider this his best film. It is a well made movie, with excellent editing and cinematography. Aronofsky directs superbly, I consider him one of the more promising directors around and The Wrestler doesn't do anything to change my mind. The soundtrack is memorable, the script has some suitably dour moments but also some hopeful ones and jolts at humour- loved the the scene of Robinson's first shift behind a supermarket deli counter- and the story is really quite remarkable and compelling, I couldn't help drawing parallels to Mickey Rourke's own career and life. Rourke himself is just perfect here, he gives the role a lot of humanity which I appreciated. Marisa Tomei's role is a rather obvious one, but she like Rourke portrays it wonderfully regardless. All in all, one of the best of 2008. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
"freeist","5","1","3","10 December 2009"," A slow, but good, movie.
","This movie is about Randy the Ram, a washed-up, big-name wrestler trying to draw together his tattered life outside the ring before he must retire to it. It is the kind of movie people love to give awards to, but that probably says more about what they think movies should be rather than what movies they really enjoy. This is the kind of movie that is given plenty of awards but that few people remember after five years.<br/><br/>That might sound all unfair, especially when in most ways, this movie is excellent. The acting, cinematography, and dialog are all excellent. So what's wrong? Only that it's a simple story told slowly, and to make that worse, it uses a shaky camera, imitating a documentary for whatever artistic reason. I have loved other movies by this director, Darren Aronofsky, because anybody who could make a subject like mathematics into a cinematic horror story is always capable of walking on water. Nonetheless, I watched ""The Wrestler"" on DVD, and there's no way I would have survived seeing it at a theater. I had to take ten minute intermissions three times. That's not true of Aronofsky's other movies.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, when it was over, I must admit I liked the story. And Mickey Rourke as Randy is as excellent as they say. Marisa Tomei as Cassidy, an aging stripper, is also excellent, and I was impressed at how fair this movie was toward that character. Evan Rachel Wood plays Stephanie, Randy's alienated daughter, and she gives a performance on par with Rourke's and Tomei's. This was another part that, if not skillfully written and acted, could have easily become trite.<br/><br/>Plus, between the slowness, there are very beautiful scenes. So, I could say that even with the drawbacks, ""The Wrestler"" is worth it, depending on your attention reserves."

","Once again the ten star reviews and top ten lists just leave me scratching my head. This whole exercise is a pedestrian piece of film making which never really connected with me. I found the fact that wrestlers really sustain some serious injuries during these ""make believe"" battles to be much more interesting than the story itself. In fact, the back stage camaraderie between these leotard clad warriors is the only reason I rated this movie as high as I did. This could have just as easily been a behind the scenes documentary about the WWF. In fact, I wish it had been, that way I could have skipped it all together (not really being a fan of wrestling). The only reason I watched this movie was because the professional critics were raving about the vividly drawn characters and compelling story. Personally, I thought the relationships between the characters are all dead ends and I really didn't care what happened to any of them. I did like the parallels being played out between the wrestler nearing the end of his career, and the stripper reaching her final pole dance, but even that wasn't enough to garner more than a tepid five stars. That being said, I thought Mickey Rourke was fantastic in his role...I just wish it gave him a little more to do!"

If Viola Davis could have been nominated for best supporting actress in ""Doubt"" for 1 scene, Wood should have been so as well.<br/><br/>Marisa Tomei also fares well as the stripper who has mixed feelings about Rourke.<br/><br/>Basically a film about 3 unhappy people whose unhappiness spills over to one another.<br/><br/>By the way, when bypass surgery occurs it's time to call a halt to wrestling."

"Bunuel1976","8","1","3","8 February 2009"," THE WRESTLER (Darren Aronofsky, 2008) ***1/2
","This year I have been slow in catching up with the major Oscar contenders before the big night itself and this is only the second one of them that I have seen; considering the hype which preceded this film (even here on this Forum) and fully knowing my own skepticism about contemporary fare, I was wary of having to face bitter disappointment once I got to it. The irony is that, in spite of the ultra-familiar central premise and theme (it's basically an indie version of ROCKY BALBOA [2006] but set in the world of Wrestling, about a has-been regaining self-respect and trying to sort out his personal life), the film still compels attention throughout ¬ñ largely because it takes the character study route. It is certainly rare that an actor is given as direct an opportunity to invest a role with his own personal experiences but, in hindsight, all the praise showered on Mickey Rourke's comeback performance is well-deserved. However, his female co-stars Marisa Tomei and Evan Rachel Wood ¬ñ playing the protagonist's girlfriend (an over-age stripper with a kid of her own) and estranged daughter respectively ¬ñ aren't forgotten by their director and allowed to leave their mark on the film as well; usually, I would have deplored the sex'n'drugs incident with the teenage groupie as being totally gratuitous but seeing how this was another of Rourke's hit-and-miss attempts to connect with the two important females in his life, provides immense poignancy and the requisite touch of authenticity (aided, of course, by the unglamorous milieux, including Rourke's humiliating stretch as a deli counter attendant). Admittedly, I used to be a big fan of wrestling as a kid, until the obviousness of the matches being staged (as opposed to real) started to grate on me; however, the sometimes extremely bloody fights on display here ¬ñ especially one in which Rourke's opponent empties a stapler on him! ¬ñ reminded me even more of 2 wrestling-themed Japanese animated series I have fond memories of: TIGER MASK (1969-71) and its follow-up (1981-82)! Still, I was surprised to see the various contestants actually 'scripting' their bouts beforehand¬Önot to mention Rourke helping out with the sensationalistic aspect of the sport via self-inflicted wounds while supposedly knocked out in the ring! Another big plus to the film is the nostalgic 1980s soundtrack full of big stadium rockers, but the ambiguously open-ended conclusion was perhaps misjudged."
"Otoboke","Null","1","3","19 January 2009"," An unforgettable and powerful tale of personal triumph.
","They say that only two things in the world sell anything worth counting: sex, and violence. The former has been a well established industry tailed to sharks for near on centuries, whether it's been on the streets or on camera. The same principles can be said for the latter, but not for quite as long. When it comes to violence, there are a few examples of such that draw in the crowds, and certainly none do quite as much money and business today as the wrestling world. Back in the eighties however, it was different. The money was less grandiose, the fame limited to the fans inside the arena and the health care less than hospitable. The Wrestler which in turn takes it upon itself to document both sides of life's biggest cash cows, tells such a tale of hardship not often documented- about people who gave so much and received little but the select admiration from people heckling in the crowds- but it also tells a compelling character story to boot. The result is an often compelling, eye opening and heart wrenching experience that always feel real, human and dignified, despite its central character's sometime dubious outlook on such qualities within himself.<br/><br/>While The Wrestler ¬ñbelieve it or not- tells a story largely centred on a professional wrestler, now working his way through the harsh climate of independent organisations, the movie isn't as polarising or esoteric as you might imagine. Aronofsky, who, up until this movie has proved himself to be a director capable of telling grand stories, has always excelled in telling smaller ones revolving around human beings rather than obtuse ideas. Taking a step back from his previous effort which was a little on the robust side of things, the director here strips things down to a minimalistic character study with an under-riding story that delivers upon the theme of finding where you belong in life- who you are, and what you mean to the world. This shift in focus will certainly help ease in viewers who know nothing about professional wrestling, but that's not to say that Aronofsky neglects to detail the real hardship involved within the business.<br/><br/>The Wrestler, while spending a lot of time inside the squared circle, makes such instances play second batter to the real core of the story which comes in the form of battered, bruised but still livid and ""dangerous"" Randy 'The Ram' Robinson (Mickey Rourke). Through 'The Ram' the movie fleshes out the idea of wrestling as a spectacle, and the idea of a man as a burnt out but not entirely forgotten icon. Throughout the feature Robinson is put through tables, glass and barbed wire, but this is nothing it seems to the ordeals that happen outside the ropes. The script, which details Randy's domestic problems, is where the real substance of the character's personal story lies; there's his troublesome, unrequited affection for stripper Cassidy (Marisa Tomei) and his understatedly nonexistent relationship with estranged daughter Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood), all of which comes crashing into perspective following an after-match heart-attack. Both stories share common themes; Randy wants them to find a place for him within their lives, but neither seem able to accommodate such an unstable commodity. For Cassidy, ""The Ram"" is just a friendly customer who brings a smile with his money, and for Stephanie, her father is simply a screw-up who never showed any interest in her until his accident. At times, the script can get a little overbearing, and the ideas of such drama play out better than they do on screen, but both do plenty of justice to the eventual climax of the film which plays out with a coherent sense of realist poignancy fitting to the proceeding elements building up to that point. It's a stark, gutsy move by Aronofsky, but I could think of no better way to pull the curtain.<br/><br/>If there is one element that such moments of drama really bring out within The Wrestler however, it is within the performances from the central cast. Rourke, who spends much of the feature as a man at odds with himself and unsure of where he truly belongs, consistently encapsulates the psyche and body language of such a figure. It's an understated performance, and the movie is all the better because of it. Yet when Aronosky calls for larger moments, Rourke accommodates such instances with just as much ease, never coming across as stunted or out of place. His co-stars Tomei and Wood always play second place to the leading man, but do fine jobs in their own rights. Tomei in particular gives an equally understated performance that capitalises on the script's multi-layered approach to her character; Cassidy is found bare from the waist up for a lot of the movie's runtime, but that's not to say that her character is anything as such. There's plenty of dynamism here, and Rourke and Tomei do a good job of bringing it to life without slipping into mawkish melodrama.<br/><br/>And that, in turn, is what makes The Wrestler such a gripping, enthralling experience in the first place. With a mixture of three-dimensional drama and characterisation fluent with a well paced story that documents an under-documented side of the entertainment industry, The Wrestler can be a bloody mess at times, but only because that's how the lead character feels inside. It's a movie that tells a story fit for fables and legends, and yet it does so with an elegant refrain- and contrasted with the more viscerally compelling scenes of violence and personal struggle within a ring that feels more like home than his run-down trailer in the middle of nowhere, Randy 'The Ram' Robinson's story- much like himself- is an unforgettable and powerful tale of personal triumph; an eighties heavy metal classic fit to bang your head to and salute with a thousand lighters at the same time.<br/><br/><ul><li>A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>"

","It seems that Mickey Rourke has made a grand return to the screen. After a decade plus of being in some of the worst ultra soft core pseudo porn (which wouldn't even get a Boy Scout excited)for the sex hack of all hacks,Zalman King,plus a few other films that were equally as bad (which either went direct to video or pay cable),he has regained something resembling a role that commands respect. Rourke plays Randy the Rod, a wrestler who had hit his stride in the 1980's,but had seen better days. His lifestyle had a toxic effect on the people around him. Evan Rachel Wood,who plays his estranged daughter,turns in a strong character who isn't on screen nearly enough (for my tastes,anyway),which could be one of her best acting gigs since '13'. Marisa Tomei plays a stripper who has a soft spot for Randy (and vice versa),but can't bring herself to date the customers at the bar she dances at. Darren Aronofsky makes a grand return to directing (after the somewhat disappointing 'The Fountain') with this film,adapted from the novel of the same name. Let us hope that Mickey Rourke manages to make this open window of opportunity work for him and act in some quality films again (even if he was baked to the nine's at last week's Golden Globe award ceremonies). Rated 'R' by the MPAA,this film serves up some rather nasty language,even nastier sports violence that is at times quite bloody,a scene of pervasive sexuality,semi nudity & other material that is probably not too suitable for little Johnny"

The story of a washed up wrestler, struggling for money, doing crappy small-town gym shows, dealing with drug and family issues etc...was all depicted in the documentary.

"Monotreme02","9","1","3","11 January 2009"," Aronofsky's most mature and complete work yet; tragic and harrowing
","It's about as stripped-down a you can get with movies: Unlike his previous three films, Aronofsky forfeits his unique visual abilities and tells his story with an extremely subtle, very realistic and naturalistic visual style, featuring hand-held cinematography, on-location photography, natural lighting, and beautiful hand-held tracking shots following his protagonist around, utilizing some brilliant jump-cut editing to keep the pace flowing along. Clint Mansell, who composed two of my all-time favourite film scores, for Requiem for a Dream and The Fountain, both of which were very distinctly dramatic, also takes it down a notch and delivers in The Wrestler a beautiful, subtle but haunting accompanying score.<br/><br/>The plot of the film is also a notch down from Aronofsky's previously much broader strokes. Unlike the ensemble experiences in Requiem for a Dream or the epic, time-bending undying love story of The Fountain, The Wrestler tells a very simple story about one central character. But in this case, we have a very prominent example of quality over quantity, and although the story focuses on just one character and not much really happens in it, it is still one of the most powerful, dramatic, resonant and deep and profound stories told in any film this year. I think (and hope) that The Wrestler will go down as one of the great cinematic character studies; the original screenplay by Robert D. Siegel is by far one of the best, most resonant and powerful screenplays of the year, in which he delivers to us an encompassing, comprehensive, in-depth portrayal of one of the most tragic cinematic figures ever to grace the screen.<br/><br/>The Wrestler shows us a character, Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson, who has burned every bridge in his life, and even though he eventually realizes that his life has been a long streak of mistakes, it's already too late to actually take control of things and make a profound change. Randy was a pro-wrestler in the 1980's, but after going past his prime and washing up, the inevitable result of his chosen profession, Robinson realizes that he actually has nothing else going for him in his life. It's sad to see this man, once at the top of his game, locked out of his trailer because he can't pay his rent, work at a deli counter at the supermarket; selling cheap memorabilia, old video cassettes of his fights and signatures in empty civic halls and high school gymnasiums, every once in a while signing an autograph or taking a Polaroid but most of the time sitting behind his fold-out table and looking around at the other wash-ups and has-beens; and participating in tiny, underground, independent wrestling competitions in front of crowds of no more than a few dozen people. Robinson tries to mend his broken relationship with his daughter and fails; he tries to create a meaningful relationship with his favourite stripper and fails; he tries to rehabilitate himself, retire from wrestling and take on a normal job, but eventually he comes to the realization that he has nothing left but his small legion of followers who, like him, can't let go of the past. It's a bleak, bleak story and it is sad and unavoidably tragic and depressing to watch Robinson's unstoppable downward spiral, but it is this very bar-none, no-restraint approach that makes the movie so incredibly good and worthwhile.<br/><br/>At the center of this Shakespearian tragedy is one central performance, the pillar of life in the film and its one aspect that has been garnering the most attention. Mickey Rourke has been receiving a seemingly endless slew of accolades and mentions for his performance in the film, and I must say that it is all justified. I find it hard to categorize this as Rourke's best performance, mainly because the man has never really had the most illustrious of film careers: sure, he was entertaining in various fun supporting roles in all sorts of movies over the years, but Rourke has never received and probably will never receive again a roll of such profundity and depth. Rourke's performance truly is phenomenal: like the method greats, he draws from his past experiences of being a washed-up professional boxer, and really pours every drop of visceral emotion into his performance: It's a stunning, amazing, impressive spectacle, and a performance for the ages.<br/><br/>With The Wrestler, Darren Aronofsky, easily one of the most interesting, talented and brilliant directors young directors working today, has delivered his most mature and complete work yet. A film with irresistible subtlety, in The Wrestler Aronofsky tones everything down, letting the profound, visceral drama speak for itself. It's a bleak, depressing tragedy, and this is certainly not a happy movie; a comprehensive character study of the largest scale, showing us a tragic, broken figure portrayed by Mickey Rourke in one of the most compelling acting achievements this year."
"Skoveng77","9","1","3","10 January 2009"," Really great stuff! A must-see for all wrestlers, trainees and fans alike.
","Let's just one thing straight; I'm not writing this because of Mickey Rourke. I'm not judgmental, but if I can't say anything bad about him, I'm also going to refrain from saying anything nice about him. If you read this in hopes for appraisal or criticism on Rourke, you're reading the wrong comment.<br/><br/>The Wrestler is, I believe, the closest thing you can get to a fictitious documentary from this environment. Sure, I do admit that not every old wrestling legend from the 80's is living in a trailer park, work as loading boys at the local K-Mart and limps into high school gyms to work 20 dollar matches every Saturday night, but you got to let some of the Hollywood magic have some running ground too. Some of the high points in the movie has been exaggerated, making the story sometimes a bit too far off, but then again, at some point, one or several former wrestlers have most likely experienced one or several of these things to a more or lesser degree, so by exaggerating them, the audience gets to see just how far out these things can be or go. These things could very well happen, I just find it a bit hard to believe that they would all happen to the same guy. I'm a huge wrestling fan, and I got very surprised when I got to see how many wrestlers, well-known wrestlers that is, were in the movie. There was Ron Killings, Austin Aries, Necro Butcher and Ernest ""The Cat"" Miller just to name a few. And they used real, official brand logos from the real wrestling promotions CZW WXW and ROH. It was great to see how deep into the wrestling society the film makers have gone to make this movie authentic and realistic. You get hints of how locker room discussions go, what preparations are put into a wrestling promotion or let alone a show, and how these wrestlers improvise and think creatively to make their acts look better. One of my favorite scenes was when Randy and another wrestler goes to a hardware store to find things they can use as weapons in a upcoming hardcore match.<br/><br/>To a certain respect, one could say that this is almost the life story of former WWF (WWE) star Jake Roberts, but I have not personally been able to clarify that. But for those who are familiar with Jake The Snake and his life and career will find a lot of similarities.<br/><br/>Now, since I have personally never been in a wrestlers' locker room, I can't verify just how authentic this movie is, but since it appears as raw and right-in-your-face as it does, I can't see any reason to say that this is as close as you will get to a study into a wrestling legend's life after his downfall and demise and re-rise to status as icon. That said, remember that this is after all a film, and not a real life documentary.<br/><br/>The Wrestler is no what I wanted, but just the way I expected it to be: it's dirty, grimy, raw and brutal. It's not date movie, it's wrestling. Oh! and for ""CERTAIN"" people in the WWE who shall remain nameless, I would encourage you to watch this movie and re-find the REAL purpose and the REAL meaning of wrestling!<br/><br/>Funniest thing I saw in the movie: Randy has a NES, Nintendo 8-bit, game console. He plays a game called WrestleJam III (where he's featured himself) with a kid who tells him about this new game that just came out called ""Call of Duty 4"". That scene just cracked me up. Worth a watch. Actually, worth several watches!"

","THE WRESTLER (2008) **** Mickey Rourke, Marisa Tomei, Evan Rachel Wood, Mark Margolis, Todd Barry, Wass Stevens, Judah Friedlander. Triumphant return to form by Rourke in an Oscar caliber performance as a washed up professional wrestler whose current, bleak existence is at a cross-roads where Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson attempts a comeback at past glory and a shot of redemption in his personal life in the unlikely form of veteran stripper Tomei (equally top notch) and his estranged daughter (Wood gives the film a nice shot of reality). Filmmaker Darren Aronofsky corrals a career defining/resurrection force-to-be-reckoned complex experience from Rourke whose own real-life histories/demons underscore the underdog appeal to this excellent film about requiem and respect. The original screenplay by novice Robert D. Siegel echoes Hemingway in its deceptive simplicity. Rourke appealed to Bruce Springsteen to contribute a track to the film and his poignant tune is pitch-perfect, as is the rest of the film as a whole. One of the year's best."

","First off, I thought it was great film, good acting, poetic writing and a realistic overall feeling.<br/><br/>The wrestling, like in Rocky is only the backdrop for the story which is more about Randy The Ram (Rourke)trying to make an honest wage and re build his fragile relationship with his daughter. The real world for Randy is represented in the human form of Pam (Tomei) who's life seems to be taking a similar path to the Ram.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a happy feel good movie about the glamorous world of professional wrestling then this film is definitely not for you. It shows the reality of what its like before and after your on top and just how hard life can be. Its a tragic drama that touches on the themes of passion and regret.<br/><br/>And yes its true what they say Micky Rourke is amazing in this role. His scene's with his daughter seem very genuine and heartfelt."

But that's exactly what's part of the charm who goes out with the risk of having another heart attack.<br/><br/>After all, it's his own fault that his daughter can't stand him. It's his own fault he lands just about the most pathetic job at a supermarket he could find.<br/><br/>The one bright light he has is Marissa Tomei's character who's worried about crossing the line about making friends with customers. She works as a stripper in a low class strip joint. She does change her mind but is she too late?<br/><br/>This movie is not for the squeamish. We see Rouke to staple guns, self inflicted razor cuts, unexpected shots to the head as well as snorting coke, unprotected sex in the bathroom and going through a heart attack.<br/><br/>But for me, this doesn't completely ring true. There are moments of levity in this that's much needed. Problem I see here is where does Rouke go from here?"

They're graphic and probably do a decent job of showing what a wrestler goes through every match. The rest of the movie is boring.<br/><br/>The acting is good, but the story isn't. It's slow to develop and nothing unusual happens. It's like watching a reality TV show for a washed up, broke athlete. There movie has no ending. The movie just stops.

","In ""The Wrestler,"" Mickey Rourke finds himself matched with the perfect role at the perfect moment in his career, and gives a performance that makes you wonder why he waited this long to show the world how good an actor he can be.<br/><br/>Rourke plays Randy the Ram Robinson (real name Robin, but don't call him that), a professional wrestling has-been, relegated to third-tier matches in out-of-the-way towns, attended by a smattering of fans who still remember who he is. After a particularly brutal and gimmicky match involving barbed wire, glass and a nail gun, he suffers a heart attack and undergoes bypass surgery. Faced with the prospect of not ever being able to wrestle again (which to that point has been his whole life), he decides to reconnect with his estranged daughter (Evan Rachel Wood, effective in a few brief scenes) and makes romantic overtures to a woman who works at his favorite strip joint (Marisa Tomei).<br/><br/>Much of ""The Wrestler"" feels like a documentary about the behind-the-scenes workings of professional wrestling, or more accurately, about what happens to professional wrestlers after they're spit out of the entertainment mill. We see Randy locked out of his trailer when he can't muster the rent and begging for more hours at the supermarket where he works. He's the Norma Desmond of the wrestling world, waiting patiently at autograph signings barely attended by anybody, carting around VHS tapes of his professional highlights to sell to anyone who might still actually own a VCR. He's a relic from the 1980s, as illustrated in a wonderful scene in which he and Tomei discuss those good 'ol days and the great bands they produced, until Kurt Cobain came along and ruined everything. <br/><br/>Rourke plays Randy as a gentle giant, whose tender and warm way with people belies his fierce professional persona. He gives a marvelous performance, achingly sad but not maudlin. This is pretty much his movie entirely; Tomei and Wood each get a few moments to shine, but Rourke holds the screen and doesn't let it go.<br/><br/>The only thing that marred this movie for me was its ending. Most of the movie is completely lacking any of the phony Hollywood trappings that mar so many other movies. Therefore, the ""Rocky""-style ending, with Randy's true love racing the clock to get to his match on time, and us left wondering whether or not he's going to drop dead of a heart attack right in the middle of his big moment, felt like a cheat.<br/><br/>But otherwise, this is one of the better movies I've seen this year.<br/><br/>Grade: A-"

","Like Milk, which competed with it at the Oscars in the same year, The Wrestler is a character study without any genuine character development.<br/><br/>Mickey Rourke plays washed-up wrestler Randy, but I don't think he was doing any real acting. He was playing himself. To make matters worse, Rourke fails to attempt anything new. All we get from his ""performance"" is something we've seen hundreds of times before. A broken man who cannot accept the fact that he's not in the spotlight anymore.<br/><br/>The film, like its main character, is a giant clich√©. And it's a boring clich√©. Even the subplots carry on in the same sad tradition. One involves Randy's desperate attempt to reconnect with his estranged daughter. Of course, things don't go so well because she thinks he's a ""total jerk"". Any of this sound familiar? Here's the bottom line.

It is normally made of cotton, but heavier materials such as sheep's wool can also be used, especially in colder climates in Iraq and Syria. The style of the thawb varies slightly among the various regions within the Arab States of the Persian Gulf. The sleeves and the collar can be stiffened to give a more formal appearance. Other names may be used for this garment. In Souraqia and Oman, dishdasha is the most common word for the garment; in the UAE, the word kandura is used. In Morocco, the sleeves tend to be much shorter so that the thawb may seem more like a long T-shirt and is locally called gandora. Also the neck tends to be more open than in its Saudi counterpart and is often embroidered as is the breast pocket. Also it might lack buttons altogether. The term thawb is also used to refer to similar women's garments. The traditional Palestinian woman's long tunic is called thawb. Another example is a very long, over-sized woman's garment with a heavily embroidered front panel and billowing back, also known as a Khaleeji dress, which is most commonly seen in the West worn for performance of the Saudi women's social-style dances, in which manipulation of the large thawb is a key component.

The dude was at his peak in Diner and Angel Heart (all 1980s films), but he threw it all away for odd roles in soft erotic films (a good 9 and ¬Ω Weeks and a bad Wild Orchid) and a boxing career that left him with permanent scars on his face and scars on his movie career. I am one of the few who stuck by him, and I still stick by him because he knows how to play the Hollywood game when money is tight or when a quality screenplay is under your nose.<br/><br/>With his role in The Wrestler, I feel Mickey can finally jab the past away as he stars as a character so close to his personal experience, the end result grants him salvation and a worthy Oscar nomination. It may be a brutal self-destructive experience, but Mickey's enduring 1980's smile still gives me tears and hope.<br/><br/>As boxing was his output in real life, Mickey echoes his life as Randy ""The Ram,"" a washed up wrestler closing in on retirement but still breathing nostalgically for old school fans. A van is a home, a stripper (Marisa Tomei) is a comfort, and an estranged daughter (Evan Rachel Wood) is a hope. On top of that, Randy has a heart that is dying on him, giving him less time and chance for redeeming lost relationships. Only he knows this, and his arduous search for redemption is just as tough as the hits he takes in the ring.<br/><br/>Director Aronofsky of Pi and Requiem for a Dream is a supposed ""art dart,"" but this film is surprisingly conventional for most audiences. As usual, I am perplexed by how so many good films like this go unseen because only independent theaters will take them. Don't be lazy. Get up and see this one no matter where it's showing! The role Mickey takes on involved working out for 80 minutes a day, a gut to stick fiction to autobiographical, and two swollen eyes for reconciliation.

Giving Darren Aronofsky the one two punch of having boomed in the box office and being universally panned by critics, it seemed Darren's Hollywood career was down for the three count ‚Äì but all was not lots, it seemed the heavens had parted, and the film gods had bestowed upon him a saving grace in the form of an almost a fly on the war documentary-esk poignant exploration into the very real and not so glamorous side of professional wrestling, consumed with obsessions, addiction, loneliness and depression, almost a world apart from the allure and intoxicating magnetism of the bright lights of the world famous WWE.<br/><br/>Playing the title main character and also making his way back from the Hollywood grave yard, from a short spell and mild success in professional boxing, Mickey Rourke (staring most recently in Iron Man 2 and The Expendables) was built for this role as his character was coming to the end of this career battered and bruised, which is exactly what Rourke went through in the twilight years of his professional boxing, and with this firsthand experience pays dividends in his breathtaking and occasionally poetic performance as Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson, who can't quite give up life as a professional wrestler, even though long as gone; the thousands of fans, the money, the women and his health. What is now left behind is a; two inch shorter man living in a trailer, which he struggles to pay for with the little money he earns from the shifts he has to almost beg for at the local supermarket, and where the manager takes every opportunity to put him down and make another stupid wrestling joke. Even his wrestling career is not what it used to be, instead of a sell out crowd in Madison square garden's, is now a crowd of just under a thousand in a high school gymnasium. You would think the guy would quit, but he's love that sometimes borders on the side of obsession for wrestling, keeps him going - that and the fact he is too scared to face the real world. But luckily for him he is given a new lease of life when he is given the opportunity of a lifetime to recapture past glories when he is offered a rematch with the Ayatollah, who at the high of his fame, fought years ago in the 1980'S . But standing in his way is; a heart attack, a daughter that hates him in the shape of Evan Rachel Wood (The Ides of March ) and a stripper slash love interest in Marisa Tomei (My Cousin Vinny and In the Bedroom) who wants him to quit the business before it gets him killed. <br/><br/>I personally felt the director captures magnificently the juxtaposition of emotions that a wrestler can go through in matter of milliseconds, from one point having the feeling that they are on top of the word filled with the euphoria of a deep sense of belonging as hundreds and thousands of people scream your n name, then after the count of three and the sound of the bell, the sense of belonging almost seems to despair as right after the match the wrestler return to their solitary and lonely existence. These polar opposites are conveyed perfectly in the opening few scenes, as we start in the midst of a high profile match, seeing montage of pictures of randy on top of the world with fans screaming for more, to a few scenes later where he returns to his trailer park only to find that it's been locked out ‚Äì he even has to break in just to have somewhere warm to sleep for the night. And I felt it was refreshing to see such an honest portrayal of the world of an athlete, which I felt would have been a far better sequel to Rocky, then the rubbish we were subjected to for another 4 predictable and unnecessary 5 sequels, so if Rocky was the perfect start to a career, then Wrestler would be the end. <br/><br/>""Randy the Ram Robinson giving absolutely everything he's got! This is the very definition of heart!"" - That is a quote from the very first scene as we hear the commentary of a match, but those few words seem to set the pace and tell you everything you need to know about the film, which is about heart and following your dreams no matter what.

","The Wrestler is a stark glimpse into the life of an individual who refuses to let go of a happier time in his life. Mickey Rourke (in the performance of his career) portrays Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson‚Äîthe aging professional wrestler who clings onto his dying career like a heroin addict clings to his needle. He knows continuing to wrestle with his bad heart and failing body will lead to his demise, but he has nothing else. In the ring, he is accepted and loved. He is able forget about his failed relationship with his daughter, his menial minimum wage job, and his inability to pay his trailer rent on time. Wrestling fans who still remember him consider him to be a legend. What Randy fails to realize, however, is that it is his inability to let go of his dying career that is perpetuating many of the failures in the rest of his life.<br/><br/>His mental state is in a sort of deep freeze. He is stuck in the 1980s. He still plays his old NES and he doesn't have a cell phone or a computer. If a product was created after 1990, Randy wants no part of it. In this respect I see some interesting parallels between Randy and another legendary cinematic character‚ÄîNorma Desmond (from the film, Sunset Blvd).<br/><br/>What I really enjoyed about the film is the relationship between Randy and Cassidy (played perfectly by Marissa Tomei)‚Äîa stripper at the club Randy frequents. Both individuals work in the entertainment industry and have jobs that demand youth and physical fitness. Both are in the twilight of their respective careers. The key differences arise in their approaches to their individual situations.<br/><br/>Cassidy's outlook on her life and career play a brilliant contrast to Randy. Unlike Randy, Cassidy is eager to leave her job behind. She clearly separates her personal family life from her career, and feels uncomfortable letting the two mix in any way. Her work as an exotic dancer is a means by which she cares for her child, it does not define her. She knows she will not be able to strip much longer and has made plans to move on with her life. She is not clinging to her past like Randy.

","The film pulls you out of the illusion of wrestling world. It helps to make the point that wrestling is yet another sport and it is for entertainment only. I read a little about the film and found that it was an opportunity for Mickey Rourke to get back into films. Needless to say he has performed very well. The story struggles with a man who is aging and has no family. The film goes at a proper pace from the starting itself. The man has a daughter who doesn't want to live with him and his desperate attempts to make everything right is worth viewing. The script gives proper weight to all these things. The film however also gives an important message related to family and loved ones. Every one of us needs love from our family at the end of day. Emotions are shown really nicely. The lead character has to fight with his ego and his age in order to survive. There is however depressing tones in the film. But this is the way life goes as the film shows the after years of a big and famous wrestler. And yes the ending is one of my best.<br/><br/>""A must watch film for all."""

","Mickey Rourke? Who's that? Within five minutes of watching The Wrestler you are no longer looking at Mickey Rourke. He is Randy ""The Ram Robinson.<br/><br/>Spellbinding, mesmerising, captivating, awesome. All these half corny words are ground out for a performance like this but what it really is, is beautiful. Rourke has always had presence and he showed he still has it during his comeback as Marv in Sin City. As Randy the Ram however it is something else. <br/><br/>I'm going to be bold and say not since Viggo Mortensen became Aragorn in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, not since Robert Di Niro became Jake LaMotta in Raging Bull, and recently as Meryl Streep became Maggie Thatcher in The Iron Lady. This is where Rourke's performance stands, in the beyond great category (yes there are more but I am trying to be concise). <br/><br/>Randy the Ram is a past his prime wrestler, forced to do local gigs with minimal crowds. His boss (Todd Barry) belittles him for spraying himself with fake tan and rubbing his Lycra clad body against other men on weekends. He fruitlessly pursues a single mother, Cassidy (Marisa Tomei) who works as a stripper where he drinks every night. It seems like his life is down and out but Randy opens up just a little for Cassidey to persuade him to reconnect with his estranged daughter (Evan Rachel Wood). <br/><br/>It's through this almost reluctant attempt and reconnection that we see the real Randy. The man that put aside everything to become a wrestler because he felt that was the only place he was ever loved. <br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky's (Requiem for a Dream, The Fountain and recently Black Swan) direction is subtly brutal. He tiptoes around Randy's personal life as if we were on his shoulder and not supposed to be there. Yet it does not feel invasive despite the film's strong realism. <br/><br/>Randy does only ever have one place he loves. The same place he is worshipped. The ring. Everything else he does seems to go wrong, and some of the mistakes he makes we can see him as he's making them. The film is deeply tragic in that sense. But we root for Randy, and we side with him taking hold of the 'me against the world' mentality. At least I did. <br/><br/>What's fascinating is the world of wrestling and Rourke, aged 56 at the time of filming, is in phenomenal shape. He did a lot of the of the stunts and both of his trainers Jon Trosky and Tom Farra have parts in the film. All of the locker room scenes were improvised and this genuineness is great. The film takes us through the whole aspect of being a wrestler. The fake tanning, the shaving of body hair, the hair dye and the steroids and weight room. Like it or hate it you can still respect these guys as showmen and professional athletes and stunt-men. <br/><br/>A lot of professionals praised the film. Vince McMahon called it ""deeply touching"". Bret ""The Hit-man"" Hart, ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper and Mick Foley both came out in praise for the film. <br/><br/>This film is a real film. There are no special effects, there are no gun battles or car chases, there are no cheeky blonde girls in bikini's (yes there is a strip club but it's not glamorous). There is just the camera, great locations, great directing, great script and beautiful acting."

He is also shown using steroids which only exacerbate his deteriorating condition. To survive, he has a part time job at a supermarket where he is mocked by his boss for his former profession.<br/><br/>At night, Randy hangs out at a strip club and befriends a dancer, Cassidy(Marisa Tomei). Of course he hits on her and she explains that she has a son but refuses to date him, so he gets upset, has too much to drink, some coke and sex with a stranger; got it, this is silly beyond description. His daughter was abandoned but they reconcile, then disconnect. He has a heart attack but still wants to wrestle against his doctors advice.

","Right early on the parallels are set between ""Ram""(Mr M Rourke) and Christ with his Mary Magdalene being a pole dancer(Miss M.Tomie)rather than a prostitute.Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of The Christ"" even gets a name check just to put us on the right track. Later his body is pierced by nails and he lies on the floor of the ring as if crucified. His disciples are a gang of small boys who hang on his every word and his old - time fans who wish it was still 1986. This is a wish shared by ""Ram"" himself,who is,basically,a washed - up,burnt - out case of a professional wrestler with his future all used up.Short - sighted and hard of hearing,with arthritic knees and elbows,he pumps his body full of drugs just to keep going.It might be said ""The Wrestler"" starts where ""Requiem for a Heavyweight"" left off. It features very compelling performances by Mr Rourke and Miss Tomei whose character is even more complex than ""Ram"",albeit she too makes her living by displaying her body to strangers and inviting an entirely one - sided intimacy between her and her public. After suffering a heart attack,""Ram"" at first refuses to quit,but when it becomes clear he cannot run a hundred yards without losing his breath he reluctantly decides to call it a day. But things get steadily worse for him when he misses a dinner date with his estranged daughter and he opts for a comeback fight with his old adversary ""The Ayatollah"" on the 20th anniversary of his greatest triumph. Relishing the applause of the crowd,""Ram"" enters the ring and so starts the match that is not going to end in any good way. The wrestling scenes are all excellent,but the best scenes in the movie for me take part in the ""Acme"" supermarket where ""Ram"" is forced to work in the deli counter to earn some cash.He starts off tentatively but gains confidence and is soon on a high,but it all comes crashing down in a truly frightening scene where he deliberately injures his hand(symbolic again) on the cheese cutter and,spraying blood everywhere, goes into an orgy of destruction,screaming obscenities. Mr Rourke is very impressive,totally in control of his persona;a man rather belatedly looking at himself and not liking what he sees. ""The Wrestler"" is a very fine film about a very human man who,like most of us has weaknesses that generally are just about balanced by his strengths,and decides at the end,to go out with all his strengths blazing.I hope I might be morally brave enough to do that when the time comes."

","I am a fan of Mickey Rourke. I always was. This is the story of a man who has nothing left in life. His daughter is gone. His only friend, a strip dancer, is there, but he knows that it is going to be tough for her. There is a point of no return he has crossed. So he goes to the end of his destiny, which is what a hero does. He chooses his way of going because his heart cannot take it anymore. I really thought he would make it as a salesman in the supermarket. He was so funny and full of life. But no, destiny did not want it. An unforgiving daughter and a dark night alone in the snow sealed his destiny. It is a true lesson of life. Because losers are not the one we think. There are no losers. There are missing opportunities, missing words. The daughter should have told him it was okay. The dancer should have told him he could watch her dance. And that lady in the supermarket should have known that it is a human being who is doing the service, not a robot. Like drops of rain, one after the other, small and innocent, because no one will ever say he is guilty of pushing another person to suicide, all these drops will go and wash someone away. I have really cried at the end of that movie. It is heart breaking. Where is God? Where is redemption and forgiveness? Why is it that we cannot say that a smile and to say ""Yes, it is okay"" would save one person? And to save one is to save the world. Gone is the Ram to the green valley of troubled souls. He loved kids, and he will not be alone in the other world. Thank you for this movie!! And thank you, Mr Rourke. I know what it means to play like this. Heart breaking."

"wakemeup36","5","0","4","9 July 2011"," Different, yet generic
","My reviewing gears are a bit rusty so I apologize in advance if this review comes off as unfocused.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky, a director who is known for his somewhat unconventional films, has recently garnered a lot of critical acclaim due to the famous Black Swan. But then again, pretty much every full length film he has directed has garnered a positive reaction and this one is no different. Critics praised it, average movie goers praised it, everyone seems to love it, so it must be as great film right? Quoting a rather popular one liner from Arnold Schwarzenegger's famous Commando will make my answer to the previous question quite clear. 'WRONG!!! *Gunshot*' Well, you can exclude the gunshot but my point remains, there is nothing great about this film at all. Where is all this praise coming from? I'm not sure at all.<br/><br/>The story is pretty straightforward. A wrestler who is way past his prime is struggling with his professional and personal lives. He's tries to balance them and faces hurdles in trying to accomplish this feat. He tries to find out what's best for him and whether he should continue his wrestling career.<br/><br/>There are some things that are definitely different about this film. For example, the presentation itself is quite interesting. The film is shot in a rather uncomfortable way which is little hard to describe. I guess this is an attempt to make the film more realistic, but this does not make the film enjoyable to watch at times. The movie has kind of a dark atmosphere, which is commendable, though not entirely consistent. There isn't much of the glamour you might see in quite a few Hollywood films about celebrities. Definitely a different take on such a subject.<br/><br/>However, there are a lot of problems that plague this film. Firstly, the story doesn't have anything special or original about it. 'Randy', our protagonist, is infected with typical Hollywood clich√©s. He's a negligent father (surprise, surprise), he's in love with a woman who has many problems herself and most importantly, he is portrayed as very selfish. Other problems include rather awkward moments which completely ruin the feel of the film. For example, there's a scene where he tries to bond with his daughter. They both go into an abandoned building and, get ready for this, start randomly dancing with each other. That's just.... silly. Another scene has Randy and the stripper talking about how 80s music is great and how 90s music is the devil. The conversation goes something like 'I love 80s music!' 'Me too!' 'I hate 90s music!' 'Me too!' 'Let's make out now' 'Alright!' Uhh... yeah... not a very well thought out scene at all.<br/><br/>Really, I just scratched the surface of what I don't like about this film. These are not the only deficiencies this film suffers from. Randy's 'depressing' life is sometimes just not depressing. And I'm not talking about the purposefully happy parts either. The excess use of nudity and blood seems kind of unnecessary. But the biggest, most glaring flaw of this film is that it is just not really enjoyable to watch. Sure, some parts are definitely intriguing, some scenes are shot very well, and some of the ideas aren't too bad, but overall there was nothing that captured me, made me want to like the characters, or just enjoy myself while watching the film. It was uncomfortable to watch at times (which I'm not sure if I should consider it a good trait), it was interesting and I can't say I was particularly bored at any point but there was nothing in the movie that made it seem 'good'. I don't think I'll ever understand the hype around Darren Aronofsky's films."

","The Wrestler is a drama about an old wrestling star, Randy the Ram, that once upon a time was one of the great, that nowadays travels and performs at small local wrestling events, living of his old fame. He is constantly strapped for cash, and fills out his paycheck with smalltime work at the local supermarket. But there might be change on the horizon, it is soon the 20th anniversary of one of his classical fights, and a rematch might give him a last chance to be in the spotlight. But a heart attack puts everything in perspective, and jeopardy. Randy struggles to reconnect with his estranged daughter and connect with a local stripper he is fond of.<br/><br/>It is a slow, quite sad story that is told in Wrestler. The performances of the cast is good, and the characters seem well written with good depth, even though most of them are not explored very much. But even though Randy, the main character, is a good hearted, kind man that means well but not always succeeds to do good, I fail to really connect, to sympathize with him. Ironically enough I found it easier to sympathize with Bad Blake in Crazy Heart, a movie with a theme very much alike the Wrestler. One reason might be that the Wrestler is very much focused on Randy, compared to Crazy Heart that has much stronger supporting characters.<br/><br/>The Wrestler is a good movie, but it doesn't quite live up to its own hype. It did mark a kind of return for Mickey Rourke, and he does his role very well. But it is not really enough to carry and lift the movie to any greater heights, I'm sorry to say.<br/><br/>6/10"

","This film strived for gritty realism but failed. The dialogue, acting,and superficiality of this film made it ultimately fake. The film was mainly a gross-out; bloodletting through razor blades, staple guns, deli slicers. The relationships between Ram and the stripper or his daughter were clich√© and predictable. What the heck ever happened to Mickey Rourke? I know that he tried his hand at boxing in the early 90's. He apparently lost quite a few matches because his face seems unrecognizable from the leading man in the 80's. He looks like Ward Bond on steroids. He obviously took a lot of steroids to become transformed from a skinny young man to a muscle-packed middle ager in his mid fifties. In real life, he's a strange, drugged out person, so his acting in this film wasn't much of a stretch and should not have been considered for the Oscar nomination for Best Actor. Marissa Tomei took the opportunity here to show off her finely toned body - very nice for a woman past forty. She did, however, use a much younger stunt double in the scenes where she wiggled her naked bottom on the stage. The film could have been much more powerful and effective, but it dripped with forced sentiment. In the hands of a more capable director,along with a better screenplay, it could have been a contender. Creepy trivia: Rourke is having an off screen affair with the actress who played his daughter. She's 30 years younger than him. Another thing that creeped me out: Why does ""Ram"" pin up his long hair like a woman instead of wearing a ponytail? Sick."
"Turfseer","6","0","2","5 September 2009"," Sympathetic but critical fable of the world of low-rent pro wrestling
","The Wrestler introduces us to a behind-the-scenes look at the world of low-rent professional wrestling through the eyes of one Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson, an aging pro wrestler who's desperate to stay in the business despite being way past his prime. Director Darren Aronofsky treats the wrestling world sympathetically and partly shoots his film in the style of a documentary. He suggests that pro wrestlers are a benign bunch who work hard at their 'craft'. From the outset one sees that there is a great camaraderie between the wrestlers who are determined not to upstage one another and always put on a 'good show'. After watching 'The Wrestler', one comes away with a modicum of respect for these 'entertainers', as it appears quite a bit of rehearsal and detailed preparation goes into creating their mini-spectacles for the public.<br/><br/>To reinforce the idea that the wrestling world is populated by 'good guys', the film's protagonist (very well-played by Mickey Rourke) is made out to be a tough guy with a heart of gold. The film's screenwriter, Robert Siegal, establishes that early on when he has Randy tumble around with the kids in the trailer park who all seem to love him. What's more Randy seems to really enjoy signing autographs and treats the younger wrestlers with the utmost respect.<br/><br/>One of 'The Wrestler's' great strengths is that despite having respect for the journeymen who are devoted to their craft, it doesn't sugar coat the nature of the business itself. Pro wrestling is still a brutal sport that exacts a tremendous physical toll on its 'actors'. In one memorable scene, Randy hides a razor underneath his bandaged hand and uses it to cut himself on the forehead in order to draw blood in order to make his act more realistic. Right before the film's midpoint, another wrestler uses a staple gun on both himself and Randy as they tumble around in the ring. The peddling of steroids, hormones and illegal prescription medication is seen as routine when Randy casually buys a supply of HGH (Human Growth hormone) from a dealer inside the locker room.<br/><br/>Randy is a tragic figure since he's not a bad guy but one who is unable to accept the fact that he is growing older. After he has a heart attack after a match and undergoes bypass surgery, he accepts his physician's admonitions that he'll probably die if he gets in the ring again. After working in a humiliating job behind a deli counter at a supermarket, the Ram can't accept being away from the only world he's ever known and decides to go ahead with the 20th anniversary of his famed fight with the 'Ayatollah', now a used car salesman who decides to come out of retirement for the money (It seemed a little too 'easy' for Randy to end up in that humiliating job behind the deli counter and I wonder why he didn't try harder to get a job that he could tolerate a bit better, such as driving a cab. Of course, without working at the humiliating job, there would be no direct motivation for his decision to return to the ring).<br/><br/>Aronofsky's subplots include Randy's relationship with Marissa Tomei's lap dancer with a heart of gold, Cassidy, and estranged daughter Stephanie (played by Evan Rachel Wood). Cassidy parallels Randy's journey in that they both work in self-destructive professions. She too has a 'good heart', trying to raise a young son, while working in a seedy strip club. When Randy reveals he's had a heart attack, she no longer sees him as another 'customer' and eventually tries to prevent him from going ahead with his fight with the Ayatollah. When she arrives at the arena, she realizes that Randy is lost and is unable to stop his self-destructive spiral. Randy looks for her during the fight but sees she's already left.<br/><br/>Randy's attempted reconciliation with his estranged daughter is a less developed subplot in the film. We find out little about the daughter, only that Randy ignored her when she was young and now wants to make amends. There's a good scene where Randy forgets about his dinner date with his daughter and instead ends up sniffing cocaine and having sex with a woman. The daughter's decision to cut all ties with her father after he shows up late for their date serves to illustrate another one of the wrestler's character flaws.<br/><br/>Mickey Rourke seemed perfect for the part of Randy with his weather-beaten face and muscular but banged-up body. Rourke, whose career took a nosedive after being perceived in Hollywood as an unsavory character, shows that he has a sensitive side and is not such a bad guy after all. Like Randy, age has mellowed him! The Wrestler doesn't pretend to be a profound character study. In a sense, there are no real bad characters in this world. Rather, the world they are in is defective. The Wrestler is more a simple fable, a cautionary tale to all of us, that we should not resist the idea of aging gracefully."

","Mickey Rourke delivers a performance here that will mark his place in movie history ‚Äì something that nobody would have predicted a few years back when his career was on the skids and his pretty-boy looks had been battered beyond recognition by his time as a professional boxer. Thank God the studio relented and allowed director Aronofsky to use Rourke instead of their preferred choice of Nic Cage (Nic Cage ‚Äì can you imagine it? What a mess he would have made of the part.) The parallels between Randy 'The Ram' Robinson and Rourke are obvious and well-documented, and Rourke must have felt he was born to play the role the moment he first read the script. Marisa Tomei, as the ageing stripper with whom he begins a tentative relationship also gives a notable performance.<br/><br/>The story is nothing new, and the characters have been seen before in countless movies, but it isn't the story that's the thing here but the depth of the characterisation and the verisimilitude. Robinson is a man who time has passed by, still living off glory days that have long gone. Twenty years past his prime, he lives in a trailer park, drives a beat up van, frequents seedy strip clubs and fights in town halls and run-down social clubs. The wrestling circuit is the only world he is comfortable with because it's the one that has fashioned him and it is the one in which he earns the respect of his peers. In the real world, even though he's a nice, gentle guy, he is awkward and out of place. His boss looks down on him, and he is most comfortable with kids who like him for who he is. But the world Robinson prefers is a sham, a pantomime for which he dies his hair, fakes his tan and pumps his body full of steroids, and in some respects it is similar to the spurious glamour of Pam/Cassidy's job. The pair of them are both past their prime, but while Cassidy realises the fact and begins to make attempts to escape the life of a stripper, Robinson finds himself drawn back to the comfort of the world of wrestling after a heart attack forces his unplanned retirement.<br/><br/>The sub-plot regarding Robinson's relationship with his estranged daughter, like all other aspects of the plot, is very ordinary on paper, but it elicits some remarkable performances from Evan Rachel Wood and Rourke in their scenes together.<br/><br/>Aronofsky leaves the final scene open. Robinson might be leaping to his death or to one last victory. Either way, it's fairly certain he won't return to the ring."

Mickey Rourke was superb in his role and deserved all the credit he deserves but there was nothing here that was truly memorable that would have me applauding at the end which it sounds like others here wanted to do. Maybe everyone is fawning over director Aronofsky again who is the current darling of the movie industry and could probably win an award for filming paint drying. The movie was very gritty and realistic and it did pull on the heartstrings in many ways but reading comments that portray this as the best movie of the year and in best 50 movie of all time lists is way out of line. It is however the best wrestling movie I've ever seen!"

","I'm a huge wrestling fan and have been for years. So when I heard all the hype for this movie and the suggestion of an Oscar winning performance by Mr Rourke by just about everyone on television, I thought this movie was going to be right up my alley. But I found it quite boring. Now I know it wasn't meant to be a WWE pay per view and full of action, I just didn't get drawn in by any of the performances in this film. I usually like ""boring"" movies if they can suck you into the story. Maybe all the hype just got my expectations up to high, which has happened to me in the past and is why I tend not to watch previews. If you want to see a better wrestling movie with real life drama go get the doco Beyond the Mat. You might be surprised at the similarities between the fictional Randy ""The Ram"" story and the real Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts story."
"jeffinny109","8","0","1","28 June 2009"," Honesty, self-pity. self-rising....regret, warning minor spoiler
","To me this movie is about Mickey obviously, but more than that, not even about wrestling. It really shows how regret is dealt with in all fashions, and how to either overcome or even better, to live with past decisions that are almost if not impossible to overcome. How do we deal with this ourselves? Do we become more self-abusive, seeking righteous behavior, make amends, or stay with what has kept us strong and to what we believe we are. Mickey, or The Ram, I am sure put his recent past obviously in this part, so it showed an amazing job by an actor, who did get a perfect role to fit him in the past, present, and maybe to see things in the future that he is not alone. The movie really bases itself on a wrestler, professional wrestler - symbolic to various wrestlers from the 80's, 90's,.... what is missing a bit in the movie may be the very little we get to see of The Ram's early life and what led up to the result of where he is today, hanging on to a career that deserves retirement at an earlier age. Especially when you may not have the same health as when you were 21. The uplifting part of the movie, is that Mickey never gives up, even when you think is about to, he doesn't give up being alone, and doesn't give up what he wants to do to make it better. However, being left with very few choices at least in his close minded head, brings him back to what he knows best, that is being The Ram, through thick and thin, that's what he is, what he knows best, and where his self-fulfilling honor lies. Very good movie, and stellar acting. However, it didn't reach it's full potential, halting it's best picture nomination in my opinion"

Anyway the movie was short and bitter and certainly not a feel good movie of the summer. However Darren Arnofski's films are never feel good movies with the exception of maybe the Fountain which I am a huge fan of.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie as a back up movie in case you didn't get the one you wanted in Netflix or whatever, but this movie isn't going to knock you off your rocker, nor will it make you wanna wrestle."

","Mickey Rourke turned away from acting to become a pro-boxer, which is what changed his face, and after almost a decade of bad press, he returned to acting with Sin City. He needed another big break with a leading role, and this sports drama from director Darren Aronofsky (Requiem for a Dream) was the perfect choice. Basically Randy 'The Ram' Robinson (BAFTA and Golden Globe, and Oscar nominated Rourke) is a successful wrestler, but after a near-fatal heart attack, the doctor says that his next match could be his last. After deciding to retire, Randy has got a job in a supermarket, hanging out with his stripper friend Pam 'Cassidy' (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Marisa Tomei) and trying to rekindle his relationship with teenage daughter Stephanie (Thirteen's Evan Rachel Wood). After Pam and Stephanie reject him, and he loses his patience in his job, Randy decides to go back into the ring for his fans and a big rematch against The Ayatollah (Ernest Miller), even knowing he may die. Also starring Mark Margolis as Lenny, Todd Barry as Wayne, Wass Stevens as Nick Volpe, Judah Friedlander as Scott Brumberg, Dylan Keith Summers as Necro Butcher and Tommy Farra as Tommy Rotten. Sean Penn won the Oscar for Milk, and while his good, I think it would have made more sense that Rourke won, after getting the other two big awards. He was brilliant as the leading character, a fantastic comeback, Tomei and Wood are great support, it is a great story, and the wrestling scenes are engaging, a fantastic film. It won the Golden Globe for Best Original Song for Bruce Springsteen's title song. Very good!"

","Despite its much-touted performances the Wrestler simply did not connect with me. Darren Aronofsky is definitely one of the best living directors. I am certain that history will bear this out. However This is without a doubt his least successful effort to date. The story line is predictable. The characters and plot have been rehashed from a host of existing movies revolving around washed up athletes, rock stars, celebrities and workaholic dads. At best it's an artsy ""Rocky"" sequel. I'm very happy for Mickey Rourke. He's finally found his comeback vehicle. It's his story, not the film itself, that's created and sustained the entire buzz. But neither he nor Marisa Tormei nor the cinematography was enough to carry this film. This is a great argument that, in film anyway, the sum of the parts doesn't always equal the whole.

Rourke and Tomey are excellent in their performances, as were the actors playing his daughter and the prickly supermarket supervisor.

Mickey Rourke is Randy 'The Ram' Robinson, who 20 years ago was at the top of his game, but now picks up a few bucks here and there in small venues.

"tfrizzell","Null","0","1","29 April 2009"," Wrestling With Life and One's Self.
","Bleak, dark, and arguably empty piece from young gifted director Darren Aronofsky (best known for ""Pi"" and ""Requiem for a Dream"") focuses on the potential fleeting last professional days of the titled character (Mickey Rourke, definitely looking much different from his hay-day of the 1980s). Rourke is a has-been who seems to have found ways in every direction to mess up his life, whether it be with steroid use, over-drinking, his somewhat indifferent attitude towards women, or his acutely strained relationship (or lack thereof) with adult daughter Evan Rachel Wood. Also along for the demoralizing trip is over-the-hill lap dancer Marisa Tomei who just seems to be the kind of girl who would get mixed up in the titled character's pathetic existence. ""The Wrestler"" is one of those pictures which works in downward cycles. Just when you think there is going to be a redeeming and uplifting moment in the film, the characters find a way to mess it up. In short, the movie examines the extreme foibles and miscues of people who just seem destined to underachieving and sometimes ultimate failure. Overall, the film keeps the audience interested in spite of itself. The world of wrestling becomes a boring and almost completely unnecessary footnote as over-pumped boneheads have jam sessions choreographing their upcoming bouts. The sport does not generate much enthusiasm and its use here was meant to prove a point which is never fully realized. Over-hyped and way over-praised. 4 stars out of 5."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","0","1","8 April 2009"," Good in all respects but doesn't quite excel
","I have used a symphony restructure as analogy in commenting on quite a few movies and I'll resort to that again here.<br/><br/>The first movement introduces the audience to the reality of the world of ""professional"" wrestling. I'm surprised if anyone is not aware that ""professional"" in this context refers more to acting ability rather than athletic ability although the latter is also required. But few (including this comment poster) have seen such an unflinchingly gritty depiction of the things (which I do not have the stomach to describe) that are done on stage, sorry, I mean in the ring, to please the bloodthirsty, sadistic audience. The amazing thing is the genuine comradeship and care backstage between the people who inflict all kinds of pain unimaginable to one another out there in front of the audience. We see all these through the protagonist Randy ""The Ram"" (Mickey Rourke), 20 years after his peak, still struggling to make a living. The first movement ends with Randy passing out backstage after a gruesome match, and discovered to have a heart condition that almost killed him.<br/><br/>The second movement brings up two new themes, romance and parental love. Facing poverty and loneliness, Randy is not about to give up. As a lucrative, after-20-years rematch is all but out of the question Randy takes up odd jobs, including working behind a meat counter in a supermarket. Amazingly, he enjoys this, and brings a jovial atmosphere to his work environment. He also develops a promising relationship with a stripper Cassidy (Marisa Tomei), who in turn suggests that he look up and make amends with estranged daughter Stephanie. This does not start out well but gradually, Stephanie is won over. If this were really a symphony, you would here the gloomy minor keys modulate into bright harmonies in major keys.<br/><br/>The mood turns ominous again in the third movement, as things start to go wrong. Cassidy tells him that the limit has been reached, the intimacy is a mistake and she would rather consider him a paying customer and nothing more. Through negligence, he hits a raw nerve with Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood), reigniting all the antagonism of the neglected little girl to a point beyond absolution. It comes therefore as no surprise that he finally reaches the breaking point at his job. With nothing left but his two old friends, poverty and loneliness, Randy has only one option left ‚Äì to go back to the only thing he really knowns. The rematch is on again.<br/><br/>The final movement needs no elaboration, unless this is the first time you ever see a movie.<br/><br/>One thing about this movie that I notice is that there is no villain, unless you count the obnoxious supermarket manager. As I mentioned, once they get backstage, the wrestlers who appears to be trying to kill each other in the ring treat each other with nothing less than, warm, loving care. The tragedy of Randy is in himself. With all his shortcomings and weaknesses, Randy is a good man. And that is the most heartbreaking thing.<br/><br/>Mickey Rourke and Marisa Tomei certainly deserve their Oscar nominations and no one would object if they won (Rourke did win the Golden Globe). But then, it's a tough competition. One main reason for me to see this movie is actually Evan Rachel Wood who was so impressive playing against Michael Douglas in ""King of California"". In fact, she almost reprised the same role here, with just the father replaced. But then ""King"" is a heart-warming comedy while ""Wrestler"" is a heart-breaking tragedy and she has a far less significant role here.<br/><br/>""The wrestler"" is a good movie, scoring high in every respect. It's just that it doesn't excel in any particular way."

The plot is really interesting, raw and very real, although it has a slow rhythm it never turns tiresome to the viewer, in fact as the movie moves along you wanna know more and more. The wrestler has a wonderful cast. Mickey Rourke making an spectacular comeback to the movie industry, his performance is flawless, so powerful and convincing, he really deserved that Oscar in my opinion.

","The Wrestler is easily one of the best films of 2008 and it's a shame that this movie hasn't received more attention since it's release, but at least the two big players in this film, Mickey Rourke and Marisa Tomei have each been awarded Oscar nominations. Tomei never seems to age. She may be even more attractive now than she was 17 years ago in My Cousin Vinny. But what I like about her is that she not only has a smoking hot bod, but she has genuine acting ability which seems to be a rare combination in this day and age. And about Rourke's performance.....wow. Simply legendary. I was personally heartbroken when Sean Penn beat him out for Best Actor at the Academy Awards (although, to be fair, I have yet to see Penn's performance in Milk). Rourke seemed to tell his own life story through his character, a story of crushing loneliness and imperceptible despair. With each scene, the viewer establishes a deeper personal connection with Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson and we can't help but cheer him on as he tries to find love anywhere he can find it. Darren Aronofsky sets the scenes up very well and the costumes, makeup, and soundtrack give an even deeper since of realism (I nearly burst into tears when GNR's ""Sweet Child O' Mine"" began to play). The numerous graphic scenes mean that this movie is not for everyone, and the filming is done in a shaky, documentary-style that won't appeal to some people, but if this movie's intent is to show life in all its glory and brutality, then mission accomplished."

","Every so often, a film comes along that is so unbelievable, so permanent, and so unforgettable that you just know that after you have watched it, you feel obliged with an uncontrollable compulsion to stand up and clap having witnessed the sight of one of the greatest films ever made. A generation saw On The Waterfront and Rebel Without A Cause, a generation saw Taxi Driver and The Godfather, and now another generation sees Darren Aronofsky's 'The Wrestler' ¬ñ whilst not being the perfect film, it is a film backed with the prominence and presence of our generation's first truly perfect performance: that of Mickey Rourke's Randy 'The Ram' Robinson.<br/><br/>Mickey Rourke's performance in this film is absolutely jaw dropping. It's a performance you look at with eyes permanently fixed on the screen, executed with such brilliance and such awe-inspiring honesty that you could only have gone to somebody with a life like Mickey Rourke's for it to be held in so much reverence. This was his Johnny Cash/'Hurt' moment ¬ñ the pinnacle of a daunted and flawed career summed up in a single unforgettable moment, like a sunset behind thin summer clouds overlooking the sea producing colours a painter could only dream of painting. It's a transcendent mix of humanity and soul, a very real howl of pain that is heard only in the wails of the greatest Blues songs only ever sung in the nightmares of those who wish they could have written them.<br/><br/>Randy 'The Ram' Robinson, the Wrestler, IS Mickey Rourke. It's an honest, sympathetic portrayal of a character that he could never quite muster up and find within himself, but through another medium or another thinly veiled character could express emotionally with more depth than he could have done if he simply played himself. More-so, however, it's a portrayal for the ages.<br/><br/>The Wrestler, whilst not being the perfect, flawless film, is a film carried essentially by a single guy who turned what could have been a tedious, 2-emotion, latter day Nicholas Cage film into a powerhouse performance that could challenge even the most primitive of emotions hidden deep inside even the most jaded of people. Mickey Rourke's performance isn't just a performance; it is our generation's Taxi Driver, and our On the Waterfront. It is the benchmark for an entire generation of actors to try and surpass, and is, so far, the best performance of the 21st century without a shadow of a doubt. In years to come, this performance will be cited as one of the greats, and will never be forgotten.<br/><br/>2009 won't be remembered as the year Slumdog Millionaire triumphed or the year Kate Winslet 'finally' got an Oscar, or even the year Sean Penn won for his brilliant portrayal of Harvey Milk - it will be remembered as the year Mickey Rourke lost.<br/><br/>Aronofsky shouldn't be forgotten for capturing that moment in Mickey Rourke's career, however - like the cusp of a wave; initially starting small, growing in momentum, dropping into a recess, and finally crashing into the shoreline and leaving an indelible mark on those who were on the beach to watch it happen.<br/><br/>The Wrestler is a film with a great deal of underlying themes: struggle for humanity in the modern age, looking for the everyman in a world of poseurs and pretenders, the value of knowing when mistakes have been made, the loss of male identity and loneliness of trying to exist in a Western society increasingly reliant on the extant provisions of women - it's a very, very real and broody, ostensibly 21st century film, especially poignant for the everyday 21st century male.

","This is a disappointing Aronofsky experience and a great Mickey Rourke performance.<br/><br/>What we have is a film about a performer. Wrestling has all to do with physical acting abilities, as well as striptease. So Rourke and Tomei act performers. Actors who play actors, that's where we stand.<br/><br/>About Rourke: his character mirrors his personal life, that's probably why he was cast, and certainly why he was so enthusiastic about it, as he himself admitted. A former star, someone who created lasting impressions on the minds of those who saw him in golden years, but who eventually becomes a burnt down star, performing low gigs, with a ruined personal life. This trivia is probably the key to the success of this performance. Mickey Rourke is not as sophisticated as an actor as other ones. Because he spend most of the 90's doing other stuff and living a late childhood, he didn't progress as an artist as other actors did. But in the meanwhile he probably lived sad and terrible facts in his life. So now we have this. The reason why we trust so much in his acting here is because it sound so sadly honest. Here he is guts and heart, he is as much committed to the job as the wrestler he performs, whose life is on the ring. Rourke has a straight forward mind - you only have to read his political commentary to get that - but so does the wrestler he performs. So, what we have here is perfect casting, and true commitment. Such honest acting should and must be enhanced, it is rare to watch. Watch the first scene after the meaningful condensed credits, with Rourke sitting alone in an empty room, in the backstage of a performance. It's a perfect synthesis of what this is all about.<br/><br/>Now, this would make a simple film by some lesser director good enough. But this was directed by the man who gave us ""Pi"" and ""Requiem for a Dream"". So it's not good enough. OK, it's a character study, the way the camera constantly and ostensibly follows Rourke's back shows it. This was to be a film about Rourke, and i even admire Aronofsky having erased himself to enhance Rourke. But on and on, there's not many things to admire here. So, as many times happens, it's not a matter of what Aronofsky does here, it's about what i know he could have done, because i saw his other films. Some wrestling scenes are good, because he denounces the fakery of the whole thing, and at the same time puts her inside the scenes, contributing for making it real for our eyes.<br/><br/>My opinion: 3/5 for Rourke.<br/><br/>http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com<br/><br/>(FantasPorto 2009)"

Randy is now relegated to the small-time independent circuit and the measly handful of dollar bills he collects for a bout won't stretch to paying the rent on his trailer home - or maybe that's because he spends too much of it on booze and his favorite lap dancer, Cassidy (Marisa Tomei),in her most 'revealing' performance to date! down at his local club. Randy is alone in the world and his only family is his daughter, Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood), who has such a mountain of issues with her father that she can't stand the sight of him.

","The Wrestler is about a middle age man named Randy Robinson, who for the past twenty, or so years, has made a living as a professional wrestler. He used to be at the top of his game and considered one of the best, but now as he is encountering health problems and aging, Randy is still good, but doesn't always get the same breaks as he once did career wise. We see Randy struggling to make ends meet and taking up other work in order to bring more money in and we also see him reach out and try to connect with people, all the while also not being able to change from the hard lifestyle he has lived for quite some time now, including alcohol, drugs and a lot of wear and tear on his body. Randy must now choose what is most important to him in life and how he is to accomplish those things and stay true to his promises as well as becoming healthier and getting rid of his own personal demons and trying to get his once promising career and life back. The Wrestler completely blew me away when I saw it. I thought Mickey Rourke's performance as Randy was nothing short of brilliant because of the way he went all out for this role and just the emotion that pours through almost every scene he is in. It's a brilliant performance and one worthy of all the awards it is getting. The supporting performances by Marisa Tomei and Evan Rachel Wood are very good as well. I like how the film's director shot the film in a very gritty and realistic style approach making everything look all the more real, drab and depressing. This is not a fancy bells and whistles film, it is just raw and honest, much like the characters and the story. I for one really appreciated this style of direction and thought that it suited the film beautifully. The story for me was captivating from the first frame of the film to the last. The characters are so well developed and we learn so much about them in the two hours we are watching them, that you could swear you have known them for an eternity. The way the film shows the character's flaws and weaknesses only adds to the great character study by showing these characters as who they really are and not sugar coating anything. At times we can feel sorry for these characters, hate them and even have some pity for them. All of this is perfected by a great original screenplay and the great performances that go along with it. The wrestling scenes themselves are brutally violent, but the way they are set up are fascinating to watch and the way the cast and crew pulled them off is also applaud worthy. I liked how the film showed a darker side to human nature and showed us characters and lifestyles that most people might normally look away from, but here in this film they are brought out in front and in focus and while you the viewer may still not agree with these characters, or what they are doing, the way they live or perhaps damage their lives is heartbreaking to watch and you literally can not look away while this is going on. This is a very powerful movie that is brutally honest and I mean that in the best way possible. The film also leaves you with a lot of emotions and some scenes will definitely stay with you long after the movie. What a rewarding experience it was to see such a brilliant piece of art like this. One of 2008's best films (if not the best film of that year) and also one of the best of the past 10 years, or so. If a theatre near you has still not gotten The Wrestler be sure to e-mail your local theatre chains and nag them until they get it because this is just great stuff to behold and deserves to be seen."

","Darren Aronofsky's The Wrestler is, alongside Danny Boyle's Slumdog Millionaire, the most surprising English-language filmic achievement of 2008: shot on a below-average budget (so low the film's leading man wasn't paid at all), completed just two days before its premiere at a prestigious film festival (Venice) where Aronofsky had been torn apart by most critics two years earlier (thanks to the misunderstood and underrated The Fountain), it went on to win the Golden Lion (and cause a bit of a controversy among the jury members since festival regulations prevented from giving Mickey Rourke the Best Actor award as well) and become a critical darling. And there's good reason for that: despite all the violence and overall sadness, The Wrestler is a celebration of the underdog that even puts the more than respectable Rocky to shame. It's also, to date, Aronofsky's best film.<br/><br/>The story is a very classic and simple one: the protagonist, Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson (Rourke) is a washed-up wrestling champion (the film opens with newspapers and voice-overs commenting on his triumphs, then cuts to him sitting on a chair and reveals those victories are actually twenty years old). He manages to barely get to the end of the month (he lives in a trailer park owned by one Lenny, portrayed by Aronofsky regular Mark Margolis) by working at a supermarket in his native New Jersey and occasionally participating in a few celebratory matches for the sake of nostalgia. Obviously, this isn't enough, and after an almost fatal heart attack he decides it's time to re-evaluate his friendship with stripper Cassidy (Marisa Tomei) and get back in touch with his estranged daughter Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood). However, old habits die hard, and when he's asked to to fight his old opponent Ayatollah to celebrate the twentieth anniversary of his biggest triumph, he will have to make a tough choice.<br/><br/>After a trilogy of sorts that encouraged visual and thematic weirdness (Pi, Requiem for a Dream and The Fountain), it's refreshing to see Aronofsky deal with a traditional story (then again, he didn't write the script). He does, however, pay homage to his first feature by returning to Pi's gritty, hand-held, in-your-face approach: there are lots of scenes where the camera just follows Randy as if we were watching a documentary (or a Gus Van Sant movie), and the energy and violence that are conveyed in the fight scenes (which aren't so ""fake"" as professional wrestling is usually described) feel real and visceral. This ""raw"" style is most likely a sign of the director's feelings for the project: he really wanted to do it, and shot it fast and cheap because he knew you don't necessarily need Harvey Weinstein's backing - which is good for Oscar campaigning and little else - in order to shell out a masterpiece. The Wrestler is a textbook case of passion project: it comes from the heart, not the money-driven mind.<br/><br/>And if that isn't enough, there's one more thing to consider: Aronofsky deliberately turned down a bigger budget because that would have prevented him from casting Mickey Rourke. He's always had a good hand with actors, and the heartfelt performances given by Tomei (rightfully nominated for an Oscar) and Wood prove this beyond any doubt, but miscasting the leading role would have meant destroying the picture's artistic credibility. Fortunately, Rourke was as passionate about the project as his director, and truly delivers the effort of a lifetime. To say the part was tailor-made for him is an under statement: Rourke's tears, sweat and blood (he really injured himself most of the time, including the famous stunt with the razor blade) are the actor's redemption for all past troubles and poor choices, both in his career and his life. Sin City proved he still had talent, but this is the real comeback for someone most people thought was unable to return to, let alone surpass, former heights. That the producers even considered casting Nicolas Cage as Randy sounds like a sick joke more than anything else: this is Rourke's long-awaited moment in the spotlight, and when he says ""This is where I belong"", it is impossible not to cheer for him. And that is what truly makes The Wrestler a masterwork."

","A lot has already been said and written about ""The Wrestler"" and I really have nothing of novelty to add but I wholeheartedly agree with most reviewers who say this film is absolutely incredible in it's brutal honesty about a broken down man who's glory days are most certainly behind him. What's worst about it is that he has very little to show for it.<br/><br/>Rourke is quite simply amazing here and if you can talk about actors being born to play a part, well, this is one of those examples. You get the feeling he's reliving his life to some extent rather than portraying a character. Marisa Tomei shines here as well, displaying once again what a quality actress she is.<br/><br/>The movie stays with you long after it's ended. People make choices in life and ""The Ram"" made a clear cut choice; rather than care for and nurture those around him he wanted to follow his dream, and in the end, do the only thing he was ever really good at. To me, he is not a bad person, he's just a man who took the easy way out and ends up regretting it. He's a fragile human being, like all of us.<br/><br/>Possible spoiler <br/><br/>Salvation for him lies in his fans, who demand pain and blood for the sake of entertainment and he's more than willing to please, 'cause his only faith is in the broken bones and bruises he displays. At one point he says that he'll never stop until they tell him to. Which will never happen. There he finds his reason for living...and dying ultimately.<br/><br/>End of spoiler <br/><br/>""The Wrestler"" is one powerful film and is not to be missed.<br/><br/>And yeah, I did steal that line from the Springsteen song. Amazing song as well, captures the character incredibly well with only a few verses."

","Known more for his visual appeal along with intriguing stories, director/writer/producer Darren Aronofsky shows a different, and perhaps better, side of his mastery in storytelling.<br/><br/>I first became aware of Aronofsky after seeing his impressive REQUIEM FOR A DREAM back in 2000. Engulfed in that film's unique visual telling, I moved on six years later to see THE FOUNTAIN. Extraordinary in just about every way, especially the special effects and how he integrated them into the plot, I then went out and tried to find everything I could by this unique man. What I found was very little. A few minor productions prior to 2000, Aronofsky is an enigma; he's not out there making a movie every eight months like some directors.<br/><br/>So when I heard praise being heaped upon THE WRESTLER, it was with great surprise that I found out Aronofsky was both producer and director. I wasn't surprised because it was him, but because the story just didn't sound like something he'd do. I mean, where's the visual appeal in the story of a washed-up pro wrestler? Time for me to eat some crow...<br/><br/>The visual appeal isn't there but doesn't need to be. This is a myopic view that focuses its entire lens on that of one man, and does it so powerfully, with such an amazing story, that fans of such things as ROCKY, RAGING BULL and BRIAN'S SONG would be proud to rank it among their favorite sports-related films of all time; it's in my top five.<br/><br/>Much of the excitement has been directed at returning film star Mickey Rourke. Returning, you ask? Where had he been? Strangely appropriate, Rourke had taken a hiatus from acting and returned to one of his earlier loves: boxing. From 1991 to 1995, Rourke had become a professional boxer and won a string of matches. But he also received some crushing facial injuries that required reconstructive surgery. These injuries are still noticeable in The Wrestler, but they also give the filming of Rourke's face a unique appeal since we're talking about that of a spiraling down wrestler who's failing body can't keep up.<br/><br/>Wearing hearing aids, reading glasses, and having to work at a supermarket in order to make ends meet, Randy 'The Ram' Robinson (Rourke) is discovering what lay ahead for him, a previously successful wrestler with a fan following that's dying off ...kind of like himself.<br/><br/>Beside 'The Ram' is a stripper who's also on her downward swing. Getting older and nudged aside by younger, prettier strippers, Cassidy (Marissa Tomei, WILD HOGS) spurns The Ram's romantic advances. She still feels like she's got some stripper time left in her, even though the client√®le where she works seems to say different. The power with which Tomei pulls her battered, sex-object body around only to learn that she needs something more than a pole to dance around is incredible to watch. But can Cassidy learn that The Ram's love for her is something she needs before it's too late? This is where the crux of the story really pulls the viewer in and holds us to the very, very end.<br/><br/>The side story of The Ram's estranged daughter Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood, ACROSS THE UNIVERSE) also adds a very human quality to the main character, and gives us more of the in-depth character analysis so many films lack. It also reinforced The Ram's loneliness in a world where aging sports figures learn of their early mistakes, and that trying to make amends often results in old habits cropping up and destroying any such possibilities.<br/><br/>Finally, I have to mention the gritty film style that Aronofsky chose for The Wrestler. Hand held camera's and grainy looking film stock all added to a years-gone-by feel that was very appropriate. It also saved a ton of cash. In fact, The Wrestler cost only $7 million to make but has, apparently, made over $70 million as of this writing. The shocking fact for me is not that it's made back ten times what it cost to make, but that Aronofsky did it without any significant special effects like he used in The Fountain (cost = $35 million to make), proving that this director has the potential to make just about any film, under any circumstances, with minimal expenditures. Although this information may not be terribly interesting to movie-goers, I find this extremely admirable considering the multi-gazillion dollar films that get greenlit and then flop at the box office.<br/><br/>Aronofsky is the man. And he's got a resume to be proud of, too. And The Wrestler should rank high on his list. It should rank high on yours, too. See it for Rourke's performance. Enjoy it because Aronofsky did a fabulous job."

","This film is something different for an audience. It is about a man who's like pretty much sucks, and he is trying to live through it. What I found interesting was the more i found how depressing and horrible Randy's life turned out to be, the more interested i became in the story. I have to admit that Mickey Rourke can act really well when portraying a character who's life sucks. Next lets talk about the directing of the film. I think that Requiem for a Dream is one of the most important pictures of all time, and I feel that Darren Aronofsky is a true visionary. The directing for this film is perfect for the type of film. Instead of a more traditional type of camera work he chose a more of a documentary approach which makes the characters and events seem more real. I am not sure at this time if this movie is better than Requiem for a Dream, but it has been sticking in my mind for the last few days. The only other movie that I felt like this towards is when I first saw There Will be Blood (incidentally they are both in the running for best actor of the year). I am glad that I was able to see it around my town because it is at a very limited release even though Rourke won a golden globe for it. I know this right now that this movie is going down as one of my favorite films of all time. I recommend this to anyone to enjoy at their own leaser."

","The glory days are well past for Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson(Mickey Rourke,more on him later),an aging pro wrestler who keeps wrestling long past his prime. Still in good,if not great,shape for a man hitting middle age and having endured countless abuses in his long career,he lives the life of a near hermit,alone in a trailer park barely able to cover rent. His closest friend and/or love interest is a bright,engaging stripper(Marisa Tomei,absolutely captivating once again)who goes by the stage name of Cassidy(real name:Pam).<br/><br/>A massive heart attack after a particularly grueling match has the Ram re-evaluating his life,with repercussions that are both sublime and sad.<br/><br/>Director Darren Aronofsky seems to like making movies--WHEN he's making them--about people whose lives seem to spiral downward(Requiem for a Dream,this one and,from what I've divined about it,Pi),and this is straight up the description. The Ram is someone who may not be completely lost in his glorious past but one couldn't really blame him ife he were. He is a big,hulking,brooding shell of a man who works hard to NOT be the fighting machine his image is painted to be,being effusive and avuncular to the local kids,magnanimous and gracious to the fans(and really anyone in general),all while slowly dying on the inside. To say Mickey Rourke was able to completely fill this character out to every physically and emotionally painful end would be understatement,but I cannot think of better words to describe it. I don't think it's an understatement to say that his performance truly makes this movie,but it isn't the entirety of it. Using a mostly ""no-name"" cast,Aronofsky and screenwriter Robert D.Siegel are able to fuse very routine characters and dialog to everyone,including the three main stars--Rourke,Tomei and Even Rachel Wood(As the largely disaffected and estranged daughter of the main character)and their characters with near seamlessness. <br/><br/>Probably should've been an Academy(I believe it was a Golden Globes,among others)consideration for Best Picture,that's no matter anymore. This film walks and talks and does exactly what it aims to do: take you into the sad,heartbreaking life of a proud but broken man and making you feel every iota of that emotion and does it without hardly missing a beat. Would I say it's the best movie of 208? Well,I haven't seen all or probably even most of the movies that have ben released from last year(who has,really?),but I'd have to say this would have to be easily one of the top five. Highly recommended!"
"EijnarAmadeus","10","0","1","14 February 2009"," The performance of a lifetime.
","Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson (Mickey Rourke) is a wrestler whose glory days are way past him. Renting a worn-down trailer in the Elizabeth area of New Jersey he is struggling to make the ends meet, he works part-time down on the supermarket and in the weekends he re-lives his glory days wrestling for die-hard fans. He has a daughter (Evan Rachel Wood) somewhere he hasn't seen in years and his only friend (Marisa Tomei) works down in the local strip-bar. Alone and torn, struggling his way down the street, Randy's body has reached its absolute limits and he maybe feels that this could be a new beginning in his life.<br/><br/>Shot on location, THE WRESTLER is brutally honest and is shot documentary-style, never even flinching at the true life on screen. And the teaming of Aronofsky and Mickey Rourke is absolutely perfect; Aronofsky captures every nuance in Rourke's performance and what Rourke does with his character left me speechless and belongs among the classic performances of cinema. The camera follows Rourke/Randy on his shoulders- down the street, through the stores and corridors like a beast of burden and his failing health coming down like a thunderstorm. His body-language is harsh and it's got a lean power of experience, but those experiences are tunnel-visions from living as a popular wrestler - when Randy steps out of the ring you can feel the pain of every step he takes, every word he says is trembling with brokenness and his eyes speaks of a life traveling through gutter and frays. The realism is sturdy; the worn-out landscape of the characters chimes throughout the locations of New Jersey's wintry days. The soundtrack is minimal, and most of the music throughout the film is 80ties hair metal pumped out through speakers in bars, in Randy's van or in during matches. And when among wrestlers, we're introduced to a milieu that becomes interesting with the pull-togetherness of the wrestlers, their equal respects and the joy they find in their work. And in the ring Aronofsky does a great job shooting the spectacle of the ""sport"", and when the blood hits the floor, you do feel the same reaction of stripper Tomei's character; ""I thought wrestling was fake!"" - Well, there's nothing fake about a carefully choreographed plan. In the world of a falling man seeking redemption, there are heartbroken scenes that torn me apart, the broken Randy displays himself with a wrenching honesty, and the identification between Randy and Cassidy/Pam seems like something of a soul-peace erupting in a world stripped of fairy-tales. And it never even sniffs at sentiments - because these are things that need to be said, the screenplay of Robert D. Siegel is conventional, but bristles with pure emotion. And as any film capturing the real life, there are bursts of lighthearted humor; whether it's Randy and Cassidy/Pam (Tomei) agreeing on how Kurt Cobain and the 90ties messed up rock music, or Randy learning the updates of video games from a local kid, or the fantastic quirkiness of the wrestling-circus.<br/><br/>Bruce Springsteen wrote a great song (that frustratingly didn't get a Oscar nomination) that's full of raw power, just listen to the spare acoustic guitar and the bruised lyrics, it's played over the end credits with huge after-effect. The beating heart of THE WRESTLER is true, and so is Mickey Rourke, and it moved me more than anything I've ever seen."

","I thought the down and out fighter character was done with. So imagine my surprise when this film becomes one of the most critically acclaimed films of 2008. Why is this film such a success? Well, I don't agree with all of the reasons why.<br/><br/>Let's address the film will probably be known for in a couple years, I mean the ""Return of Mickey Rourke."" Now, I've never been that much of a Mickey Rourke fan but apparently his early work is good and he gives the rawest performance you've ever seen. But I did like him in Sin City as Marv because Marv was a character. I thought he had a character in Sin City and in the Wrestler he's really just playing himself.<br/><br/>He does a lot of stunts, get's hurt bad and makes a heart attack look very real but the entire time I'm thinking, ""Did Mickey Rourke go through all of this himself at one point in his life?"" I Wiki'd up some info on Mickey Rourke cause I was curious about his acting career. It turns out that he was popular in the 1980's, got a lot of props from fans and critics, was seen as a sex symbol, then because he couldn't make it in the acting world he decided to become a boxer. When that didn't work he came back to acting and is career is now seen as a comeback. Now, if you go and see the movie, you'll realize that THIS IS THE SAME STORY. Like, almost verbatim. Rourke's character plays Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson who was very popular in the 1980's, got a lot of affection from fans, Randy was seen as a sex symbol (that one isn't true), but in the film he has a few rough patches that involve his medical condition and in the end he has to quit the thing that he loves, only to return to it after everyone has said that he's washed up. Again, very similar. <br/><br/>So, how great is his acting? Well, there's no character, because it's just Mickey Rourke. You can say that he's using his own personal experiences to bring a performance that is very close to home, but the thing is, it's way to close to home. It would be like me saying I was acting if Charlie Kaufman made character for me, who was ashamed of himself, used humor as a defense, continued to be awkward with women, not that attractive, and was unsure of where -if anywhere- he was going. If he made that character for me, I would ""act"" out that part until it bled but, thing is, that's who I am. Mickey Rourke is Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson and because he is that character along with the fact that there really wasn't any character at all in the film, JUST Mickey Rourke I'm hesitant to say that he knocks the character out of the park. He does in a way, but it's almost like he does it with ease because he's lived it.<br/><br/>Moving on from the complicated of nature of Mickey Rourke performance, I would like to talk about the story of The Wrestler. As I stated earlier this story has been done before and to death. What makes this film different from Raging Bull, the Rocky movies, and other up and coming sports movies is the fact that it's not that he's lost too many matches, it's just that Randy is old. The whole movie is about how you only have the spot light for a certain amount of time and what do you do when you have to give it up. Randy is left with a choice, he can leave the spot light and be stuck in a world where everything he does doesn't work out, or he can stay in a world full of cheering hundreds where everyone knows who he is and everything is planned ahead of time but this world might kill him cause of his age. He's not really a spring chicken anymore. Because of Randy's heart problems he has to give up the life he loves in order to live in a world where nothing goes as planned even though he tries his hardest. Once he realizes that that's a horrible idea he comes back to his old world, full of glory and pain only to realize that everyone he loves is in the real world and can't be there to watch him die in this fantasy world. THE STORY OF THIS MOVIE IS GREAT. Much better than I thought it would be. I remember reading the plot synopsis of it when it hit Cannes and thinking that it sounded a lot like Rocky IV but the fact that this giant thing of a man is actually so fragile it makes emotional teen boys look like Rambo is just a fantastic idea. Which was the films strongest point.<br/><br/>However, one of the weakest points of the film was it's large amount of realism. Now, I was very concerned and interested when I saw the trailer for this film. It looked like Darren Aronofsky really shed his style of small tiny boxes and decided to choose ""ultra-hyper-realism."" to the point where it's almost a documentary and because of that, the points where nothing is going on are boring as a walking scene in a Gus Van Sant film. The camera work in The Wrestler is this, ""follow Mickey Rourke"" and I know many different directors would have choked Darren on the spot because that idea is straight out of the ""how not to shoot a film correctly"" book for dummies. It's boring and while the story was so good the ""acting"" of Mickey Rourke and the hyper-realism direction the film took just made me think the movie was a lot longer than it actually was. I thought the film was 2 hrs. and 30 min. But it's only an hour and 45. min."

","""The Wrestler"" follows the life of Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson, a legendary pro wrestler who was well-liked and famous as he has his own action figure and video game. However, he is now past his prime, almost over his hill, and dealing with big problems about his personal life and his health.<br/><br/>This film is almost a documentary. A lot of times it just shows Randy doing a lot of daily stuff around his camper, his gym, his wrestling arenas, his favorite strip joint, his meat counter in the supermarket, etc. Yet in all this realism, there is something riveting and touching about the whole thing.<br/><br/>The story is actually very predictable and simple. You can foresee the inevitable plot development and even the ending. It seems like you have seen it all before, but set somewhere else. But somehow it does not matter. Plot is secondary to character study in this movie. I liked how Randy's speech at the end wrapped up what the movie was all about. I also liked how the whole movie ended.<br/><br/>This film also shows the world behind the noisy show that is Professional Wrestling -- the surprising camaraderie and good will among the wrestlers, the drugs, the techniques to make the ""performance"" realistic, the groupies, etc. Very interesting even for non-wrestling fans. However, some wrestling sequences really go over the top bloody, especially the one with the staple gun.<br/><br/>Technically, the whole film is as rough as the world it depicts. The sets, the costumes, the language of the script are all so unpolished, cheap and even trashy. The cinematography is gritty, grainy and shaky, as to lend a very realistic feel to the whole project. You can see ""indie"" written all over it.<br/><br/>One of the women in The Ram's life is his estranged daughter Stephanie (played by Evan Rachel Wood). This character is sort of the weak link in this movie for me. We understand she is all so angry with her father for abandoning her in the past. But one time, she gave her dad a chance, and they had a good bonding time. Yet when he shows up late for their dinner date, I felt her reaction was a bit extreme! (Of course, we don't really know how deep the previous wounds had been.) All fathers in the audience must have felt a pang in their hearts during that sharply-worded scene.<br/><br/>The other woman in his life is Cassidy, Randy's favorite stripper. Marisa Tomei goes all out daring for this electric performance. No conservative camera angles or strategic objects hiding anything. She looks great in this movie, and so does her body! I do not remember any previous film that featured her body so generously before. Her acting is understated and very sensitive. It looked very natural for a role that is so far from how I knew her to be. For this, she was rewarded with a well-deserved Best Supporting Actress nomination by the Academy.<br/><br/>But the main man Mickey Rourke IS The Ram. The line between actor and character is definitely blurry here. There seems to be no distinction at all. The actor does not look a thing like his ""9 1/2 Weeks"" heyday anymore. You cannot recognize this man to be an actor playing a role. He is clearly living this part. It is as if no obvious acting being done. He was repulsive, disgusting and pathetic, yet he can still manage to evoke sympathy and project dignity. Rourke's amazingly real portrayal of ""The Ram"" is certainly the centerpiece around which the whole film hinges its Awards credibility."

Plus, Mickey Rourke deserves all the accolades he's been getting for this role, which is comparable only to De Niro in RAGING BULL...<br/><br/>The movie is like a BUKOWSKI novel, filled with bittersweet losers trying to make sense of the mess of their lives ... the scenes when ""Robin"" is working at the supermarket deli are unforgettable, as is every one of the other scenes in this masterwork of a ""dude's flick"", where, yes, "" I laughed, I cried""....<br/><br/>Plus, it has an eighties hard rock soundtrack ( Ratt, hilariously used in a tender bar-room scene with stripper Cassady ) and strikes the right chord in anyone who lived during that decade and now finds themselves curiously over forty, a long way from their own eighties ""golden youth"" ( but maybe I'm getting too personal here? ).<br/><br/>My only complaint, though, is the very very end.

As after years of personal problems, bad movie choices, and other problems Rourke rightfully has landed a role he can relate to as his character is of the same breed a man on a comeback.<br/><br/>Mickey is Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson a New Jersey pro wrestler who was at one time a big attraction back during the 1980's, as you the viewer even feel nostalgic during the opening as you see the pro wrestling magazines, and pay per view promos, and ""The Ram"" action figure, and plus you remember the heavy metal and big hair of the 80's also even Randy still has kept his Nintendo with the classic wrestling game some twenty years later. If you were a wrestling fan you can certainly relate to this pop culture nostalgia. Anyway glory days have passed Randy is old and washed up and down on his luck, he now must make his appearances with a traveling circuit of wrestlers in the minor leagues by doing shows at local high schools and local centers.<br/><br/>Even though on the downside Randy still entertains and give fans their bucks worth by hurting with pain by bleeding and suffering. Still he's like the energizer bunny he keeps going and going! Still even though enjoying his work, his life economically and personally seems to be going backwards as he struggles to pay rent and his only enjoyment is going to the local strip club to see a favorite of his Cassidy(Marisa Tomei who treats us to plenty of skin). To complicate matters he suffers a heart attack during a small time match as finally the nightly grind of blows, cuts, and bruises has caught up with him. He is advised to end his wrestling days by a doctor.<br/><br/>Slowly he tries to start a new life by working as a supermarket meat cutter, and finally he reunites with an only daughter Stephanie(a good supporting turn from Evan Rachel Wood) he had forsaken at an early age, yet sadly she wants nothing to do with him. So Randy then sees the light as clearly his identity was not meant to be that of a supermarket clerk and he tries to start a romance with Cassidy. Still his true passion is and has always been buried deep inside of him it's the ring that he must return to and one last go around is in store for him.<br/><br/>Really what more can I say this film will really touch your emotions for the way it shows the struggles of life and love. And it's a must see for the super performance of Mickey Rourke it was very powerful and touching as his character of ""Randy the Ram"" is one underdog you cheer and feel for. And Tomei is in top form as a likable and very sexy stripper, as always Marisa does beautiful work. ""The Wrestler"" is a must see it's a deep and moving emotional drama of a comeback of the human heart and spirit and it was good to see Mickey back to work really in his finest form. It shows that it was meant that a good warrior never stays down for the count."

For one so used to attention, love and accolades showered, to be cheered and encouraged, to be handing out high-fives, autographs and pose for photographs, it takes a lot to readjust life back to normalcy, if at all. Such is the fickleness of fame.<br/><br/>The Wrestler is deceptively simple, about one man's struggle to repair himself after every bout, who cannot connect back to the real world of disappointments. Being aged, injuries don't seem to shake off easily, and outside of the ring, Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson (Mickey Rourke) is a nobody. His real life is in shambles, and he's still bumming around trying to heal and mend his life outside the fading limelight. His body is broken, with countless of scars, a busted ear and a weakened heart. Relationships are non-existent, and has to rely on spending money to buy time with a stripper (Marisa Tomei) to whom he pours his heart out to, and has affection for. Not only has he to heal his physical self, but on the emotional front he tries to reconnect with his estranged daughter Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood).<br/><br/>It's about age and how cruel time can be to everyone of us. Old stuff fade away, new guys enter the scene, and life just goes on, whether you like it or not.<br/><br/>For those who think that they're watching WWE in The Wrestler, you cannot be more wrong on that count. It does though provide some glimpses on what goes on behind the scenes and flashing lightbulbs, song and spectacle, and for those not in the big leagues, the more independent circuit where fights are arranged and choreographed amongst the lower league players. The documentary-style cinematography adopted by Maryse Alberti also helped in pushing this aspect of the story telling, and at times blurred fact with fiction, thinking that Rourke was indeed and perhaps a real pro-wrestler whom we're tailing from behind. We do get to witness some interesting no-holds barred fights, as well as time being slowed down, and extreme closeups to reaffirm that these are professional entertainers (surely you don't think it's real, do you?) who have to look out for personal safety too.<br/><br/>But what Darren Aronofsky really packed it in, was some excellent dramatic moments for the characters. For starters, you sympathize and empathize with them. I was a wrestling fan in my teens. Was, because I outgrew it. For the curious, I belong to the Randy Savage to the Bret Hart era of WWF (back then when it was known as), having to see champions come and go, and a chord was struck, wondering if my ex-heroes had suffered the same fate as The Ram, having to try and survive hawking wares of their former glories, and reduced to nothing but a pale shadow of their glorious self. Not to say that Aronofsky doesn't have anything for wrestling fans or to artificially craft a sob-story. But instead of the cursory yeah, this is something I've seen before, he strikes right to your heart and makes all of us question how our once heroes would have faded.<br/><br/>Mickey Rourke owns this film, and has a better screen presence than his recent Marv role in Sin City, which was obscured by graphical bells and whistles. He chews up the scenery, and I can't think of any other actor who could pull this off more convincingly than Rourke. He plays The Ram with plenty of conviction and has pain, and fight, written all over his face. If Pulp Fiction was John Travolta's calling card to return to greatness, The Wrestler is Rourke's equivalent.<br/><br/>Marisa Tomei also did an excellent job as Pam Cassidy the stripper whom Randy shares an emotional attachment to. Similarly, her character parallels how age has been unkind to their respective professions. She's constantly struggling to get customers with competition from younger and hotter colleagues, and even when she does, unlike Randy who still gets adulation from appreciative fans, all she has is to suffer derogatory remarks, in order to make a living. If anything, Aronofsky does make you feel compassionate to these walking wounded characters, except probably for Evan Rachel Wood's Stephanie, who given the extremely limited screen time, wasn't given enough room for expression and got crowded out by the two veterans.<br/><br/>So now if you please, I'll go find out what had happened to my past heroes whom I had once spent my teenage years watching on the goggle box. The Wrestler opens 2009 here with a bang, and it's really highly recommended, especially for those unfamiliar with Darren Aronofsky's work."

","I give it 8/10. This looked a bit like a high budget remake of a low budget early 70's film, possibly directed by Clint Eastwood and featuring Sondra Locke as the stripper and Bruce Dern in a small part (maybe the guy who gives him the deli job.) Even though some of the fight scenes were better in the modern version, I still preferred the 70's version. If they'd made it that is.<br/><br/>Also Mickey Rourke's face looks quite odd.<br/><br/>And Marilyn Manson's girlfriend plays the daughter.<br/><br/>And I thinks it's shot in Pennsylvania.<br/><br/>Or maybe Detroit.<br/><br/>Is that ten lines yet?"
"Robert_duder","8","0","1","26 January 2009"," Fans of ""Professional"" wrestling have their moment...the movie is glorious for them!!
","When I was a kid I was enchanted with the stars of World Wrestling like Hulk Hogan, Macho Man, and Ultimate Warrior but Professional Wrestling has changed nowadays but is still a huge empire and has legions of fans. What no one would expect is a completely serious dramatic, powerful film, respecting and paying homage to the craft, and the people involved and the fans but that is exactly what Darren Aronofsky's The Wrestler does. Now I won't go into full agreement with the raving fans and critics of the film that are talking about what a moving and incredible film it is. While the film is good and entertaining and does certainly have some emotion I wouldn't call it one of the best movies of this year or last for that matter. I'm not sure it even deserves all the award nominations that it is getting. All this being said you can be completely entertained and fans of the Wrestling world will be floored by how this movie portrays their past time which I think has always been considered a joke but this could change everything. Part of this is the story, and the way it is directed, and an even bigger part is the performance by Mickey Rourke.<br/><br/>Mickey Rourke plays aging wrestler Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson. Of course everyone knows now that this apparently Rourke's rise from the ashes...never knew he was out of the ashes to begin with. Still his performance as alcoholic, washed up, emotionally disturbed wrestler who is clinging on to his youth and the fame he experienced. Rourke looks absolutely amazing for the role. He looks exactly like his character should and you would expect. He literally embodies the washed up wrestler. He is the perfect combination of what you would expect. I'm still not sure he deserves quite the accolades he is receiving but it is a great performance. Now I'm going to get harsh. The accolades and nominations for Marisa Tomei are ludicrous. Her performance as stripper and love interest Cassidy is barely bordering a joke. She spends more time naked than she does acting so I suppose if you're a fan of Marisa Tomei's body then The Wrestler will really impress you, but her actual acting ability in the film is barely existent. I will say that her chemistry with Rourke is pretty good so that does help. If she is his Adrienne (Rocky) then we are in trouble. If you're looking for a worthy female performance look to Evan Rachel Wood who plays Rourke's estranged daughter and does a much better performance. Their relationship is volatile and intense giving her the opportunity to show off some real emotion.<br/><br/>I am not all that familiar with Darren Aronofsky's direction style but this still seemed like a different style for him. There was just something very real and heartfelt about the whole overtone of the film. This could really break him into dramatic films and telling a very emotional passionate story and bringing characters to life. It is certainly a far cry from his previous work on The Fountain. The world of Professional Wrestling has a lot of fans under eighteen and this film certainly isn't for them. I think the audience it aims for are the ones who fondly remember the over the top wrestling heroes of yesteryear but regardless a solid drama is hard to come by and Rourke makes his character very watchable and very entertaining. I still stand by my feelings that it doesn't deserve film making awards but it certainly won't disappoint the movie fan. Worth seeing!! 8/10"
"parandco_1999","8","0","3","22 January 2009"," Great Movie! However meaningless point!
","The Movie was great, one of the bests of 2008. The scenario, The acts, Dialogues, even conceptualization of lifestyles of people that we rarely see around. The character of ""The Ram"" is strongly shaped and the other two women who are accompanying him are really well-shaped characters in the movie screenplay. The ending was brilliant as for Mr.Arnofsky we can expect something like this. However I did not understand what was it in the last scene, that we should bring a nation's flag into the ring and then break it down, through it away create this feeling of hate for everyone who is watching the movie? Many people in America do not even know where Korea or Cyprus or Iran are located on the map! Also many of them didn't know that this flag was the flag of more than 70 million population and a flag with more than 3000 years of history for Iran.(excluding the word: Allah ... on it!) So, someone tell me what was it about?"
"kewos","8","0","1","22 January 2009"," A lesson of good cinema!!
","The issue is common in every sport men life: ""It's time to leave. Where I can go now?"" And Aronofsky reflects it perfectly with his narrative in the movie. The Wrestler shows how the story of the boxer whose career is over (or almost) still work out for the audience. OK, technically he's not a boxer is a wrestler but it makes no difference in the story.<br/><br/>Randy Robinson (Rourke) is a wrestler at the end of his career. Fighting in 3rd category rings when he was a star in the 80's. One day he has a heart attack and doctors recommend not to go into a ring again and then is when he look around and realised he has no more in his life but wrestling, he's alone and not rich precisely. He will try to do the right things in his personal life when he couldn't do it before. <br/><br/>The main character role is perfect for M. Rourke. Maybe cause he was (or he tried) to be a boxer in the 80's. Even Rourke admit this role has a lot to do with his career back then. He knits it to perfection, it's a superb performance by Mickey Rourke. I haven't seen yet other candidates to the Oscars award but he deserves to be nominated for sure. And then you have Pam (Marisa Tomei) the stripper and mother of two son also at the end of her career and in need of changes in her life. Marisa Tomeis is also amazing performing as stripper.<br/><br/>This movie is a classic and it works so good. Aronofsky finds again the right way to relate the story. A bit depressive some times but isn't new in his movies. The scenes on the ring are incredible. Simple, no tricks but among ""Raging Bull"" one of the best I've eve seen. You will get hooked watching this. <br/><br/>I would recommend without doubts. Just have the day to watch a good drama. 8/10"
"ZombieFlanders","10","0","1","20 January 2009"," Raises the bar for realism
","""Doc, I'm a professional wrestler"" is the response from Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson (Mickey Rourke) when after just having bypass surgery following a heart attack, he is told by his doctor that he must stop putting steroids into his system and can only perform mild exercise. The significance of that assertion to Randy's story of a once great wrestling icon, now twenty years later relegated to Community Hall matches and unsatisfying signing appearances, is cemented by it being said with such conviction and pride. He is a wrestler. That is what he does. That is what he knows. Rourke embodies Ram and all his flaws in such a sincere way; the authenticity of his colossal performance raises the bar for realism.<br/><br/>Unconventional director Darren Aronofsky has shaped a documentary-like film with The Wrestler, and like the central performance is unflinching, gritty and driven by severe emotion. It is debatable whether the character of Randy is a likable one, but you are not really asked to choose anyhow. We follow him through his present day-to-day life and the film's major achievement is that you cannot help but empathize with him - as if it was real life. As if The Ram is a wrestler in our world. In that sense too, the film avoids sentimentality but still manages to be profoundly affecting and at times, painful to watch.<br/><br/>It is clear Mickey Rourke has drawn on the parallels between his real-life erratic career and Randy's. No doubt it has helped the performance, and it's a tribute to our director for pushing the actor to dig deep. The reward is a fascinating, hugely immersive journey regardless of Ram's motives, outcomes or choices. Evan Rachael-Wood and Marisa Tomei complete the roles of Randy's estranged daughter and aging stripper cum-love interest respectively. Both shine in their emotional responsibility, but Tomei's Cassidy, whose story mirrors Randy's in many ways, is finely convincing.<br/><br/>The deft cutting is reminiscent of earlier Aronofsky films, Pi and Requiem for a Dream, and works well here to keep the pace brisk and break up potentially tedious dialogue-free scenes, as well as adding energy to ones such as when Randy is working behind a supermarket Deli counter. A subtle, precise acoustic score from Clint Mansell blends appropriately amongst the eighties hair metal Randy holds so dear, ultimately confirming that on a technical level, The Wrestler is scarcely flawed. The wrestling matches themselves flow with authenticity. It's a credit to both Rourke and Aronofsky for not flinching during the handful of fights shown - making them feel real was essential, and they've entirely succeeded.<br/><br/>Exploring a relatively uncharted world in cinema, scriptwriter Robert D. Siegel gives us material that on the surface does resemble a clich√©d story, but praise must be given to the eye for detail towards the underground wrestling circuit he demonstrates. It effectively kills any chance of formula pulling us out of Randy's psyche of frustration and eventual acceptance of what he believes his life to amount too. Struggling to complete any relationship he has besides the ones he shares with his loyal fans, it's seeing Randy risking his life trying to hold on to that what makes him feel human the most, which is genuinely heart-breaking. It's also what make The Wrestler a must see film."

","Gritty, realism--like a Lucien Freud painting set in Elizabeth, New Jersey. Please know that not all of New Jersey is this ugly but it's the side of our state that is showcased in films of all kinds. <br/><br/>Some of these details in the film blew my mind. <br/><br/>1. The florescent glow of Randy's tan as he pleads with his daughter to give him a second chance at fatherhood in the middle of Winter just reminds you that there's no hope for reconciliation. It fades.<br/><br/>2. Needle dropping the roar of wrestling fans as he heads into work for his first day as a butcher.<br/><br/>3. Brando-like moments. A friend pointed this out and he was right. I mean there's that line at the end that reminded me of ON THE WATER FRONT. I read in another review that maybe this is the only role Rourke could've hit out of the park. Does that matter?<br/><br/>They tell us a 6 million dollar movie is extremely cheap but I think the budget probably added to the grit. There's some hand cam like shots that added to the realism. I often wonder how much and episode of, say, SMALLVILLE costs. Does that cost 6 million? I know they have to make a print but...<br/><br/>This film lived up to the hype. I only hated one scene --when the main character's reminisce about 80s hair metal. It's just too painful & repulsive.<br/><br/>Even though its been a long time since BARFLY they might as well hand Rourke the Oscar now."
"ande8162","9","0","1","20 January 2009"," The Rourke Show
","This film is the perfect document of the strange sport/theatric hybrid known as professional wrestling. Aronofsky's brutal exploration of the cultural phenomenon is his most mature work thus far. He's good at telling these stories of things going from bad to worse, but with this he's dropped his style-heavy inclinations and focuses in tight on the performances. I've heard Nicolas Cage and Stallone were considered for this role and I can't even imagine it. This is Rourke's movie. He owns it completely and is Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson, and that invisible line between actor and character just makes everything all the more painful to watch. I would not even be surprised to learn that Rourke really did take all those staples. The nasty violence actually gave me a bit of headache; that's how effective this movie can be. People with heart conditions beware."

","I saw this movie after couple of minutes and I'm starting to write a review. It really holding me strong this movie, and for me it's a sign that movie is a good. <br/><br/>Mickey Rourke perfectly fit into this role of old wrestler. I think that Bruce Willis couldn't do better role as near as a Mickey. The wrestling in this movie is a very raw and little bloody and realistic. That is expected, because mickey was a wrestler in a real life and no one could replace his role. <br/><br/>This movie isn't only about wrestling. It's a story about bad relationship about dad and daughter. Mickey is an old wrestler who has a nostalgic about his wrestling and his career. He was a ultimately wrestling star in the 80's. Now he is fighting only for a money and he figures that his heart is too weak for a battle. He leaving that brutal sport and starts work in market. When he was injured at work, he want to fighting again against his old man, back in the 80's.<br/><br/>I asking myself why Mickey didn't die at the end of the movie. I think it's not appropriate idea, because this movie is a very emotional drama, and his death will give the movie a clue that the Mickey is a legend. Now he is a only a very strong man who can keep wrestling, even is he very old. Either, I think that the end is actually good, and hope that on DVD will be an alternate ending. And I forget to say that Bruce Springsteen song is very good and appropriate at the end. It gives a movie a weight. <br/><br/>Also, this piece of work is better than any Rocky bullshit and Million Dollar Girl. Both movies doesn't have a realistic documentary feeling through film, and this is reason why is movie so realistic. <br/><br/>It will be very bad if Mickey doesn't get a Oscar for best performance."

","""The Wrestler"" is so very touching and poignant. Mickey Rourke is awesome. Darren Aronofsky's ""The Wrestler"" is the best movie of the year. Mickey Rourke inhabits aging professional wrestler Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson with a profound authenticity. His performance resonates true. He gives Randy such heart, spirit, and humanity. At the telling story arc, Randy confesses to Cassidy (stunning Marisa Tomei), ""You know the only place I get hurt is out there¬Ö"" Randy loves wrestling more than life. The physical beating he experiences in the ring pales in comparison to the heart wrenching losses he endures in the real world. The screenplay by Robert Siegel is absolutely moving and inspiring-- perfect.<br/><br/>Aronofsky creates an inspired vision, and all his performances are dead on. Marisa Tomei as aging mother and stripper Cassidy is astounding in her stark vulnerability. She and Rourke are not only literally naked¬óshe as the stripper and Randy in his tights, but emotionally bare, and fearless. Tomei in a quietly powerful scene tells Randy, ""I'm here. I'm really here¬Ö"" Evan Rachel Wood as Randy's estranged daughter Stephanie is powerful and uncompromising. Rourke has a heartbreaking scene where he asks for forgiveness from sullen Stephanie, ""I just don't want you to hate me¬Ö Okay?"" Then later in the scene Wood runs up beside Randy, and hugs his arm. That just touches your soul.<br/><br/>Aronofsky touches the heart, and elicits such humanity and compassion in all the performances. Mickey Rourke put on about 40 pounds of muscle. His face, either from bad plastic surgery or prolonged steroid use, strangely distinguishes Randy's authenticity, or fosters profound empathy for his character. Deep down Randy is a good man, and a hero. Marisa Tomei, who is in her forties, looks amazing as stripper Cassidy. However, that is eclipsed by the mesmerizing vulnerability she breathes into Cassidy.<br/><br/>""The Wrestler"" follows Rourke's Randy ""The Ram"" 25 years after his professional wrestling zenith. In the 80's ""The Ram"" was The World Champion and the Hulk Hogan of his day. Now the aging and damaged Randy is relegated to weekend wrestling matches at local school gymnasiums for chump change. He works at a local market, and can't make enough money to make rent, getting locked out of his own trailer at a trailer park. Randy is sweet on Cassidy, who is a stripper at the local strip club. Cassidy is a single mom, and unlike Randy, knows her days as a stripper are numbered. Tough Cassidy has a soft spot for Randy, but she knows that hooking up would be a bad idea. Randy has a daughter in college, who wants nothing to do with him. Randy is literally a broken down ""piece of meat"", held together by painkillers and steroids. Everyone on the circuit loves Randy, because he is such a good and decent soul. He always has a hug and ""How you doin' brother?"" for his fellow wrestlers. Even his drug supplier cuts him slack when doesn't have the money.<br/><br/>Randy suffers an unexpected physical tragedy, and is forced evaluate his life. Strangely, things begin to look up for Randy. He begins a relationship with Cassidy (Tomei). He makes peace with his daughter Stephanie (Wood). He lines up a reunion match against his legendary rival The Ayatolla (good Ernest Miller). However, big hearted Randy is cursed with his self-destructive nature. What Randy loves to do is wrestle. Wrestling is his life. For Randy getting beat up in the ring is less painful than the beating he has taken in life outside. That is the poignancy and nobility of Aronofsky's ""The Wrestler"". Mickey Rourke is stunning, compassionate, and powerful. He deserves to win an Oscar for the heartfelt courageous performance. Marisa Tomei is fearless and compelling as Cassidy, deserving an Oscar nod as well.<br/><br/>""The Wrestler"" is one of the most moving, and touching movies you will ever see.

"ferguson-6","8","0","1","11 January 2009"," Round and Round
","Greetings again from the darkness. Darren Aronofsky is quickly joining the elite as the breadth and depth of his films continue to amaze (Pi, Requiem for a Dream, The Fountain). Here, he takes Robert Siegel's script and turns it on its ear. The best decision he made? Standing firm on his choice of Mickey Rourke, rather than Nic Cage. Rourke brings soul to this film that Cage has never even read about.<br/><br/>Of course, the parallels between the story and Rourke's real life are well documented and somehow that is no distraction at all ... in fact, it adds to the realism and affect. Rourke's performance cannot be overstated. He is The Ram! Sure, he did a great job with the wrestling scenes, but that's just the tip. Watching him get out of bed, his hulking walk, the labored breathing and the lighting up in the ring ... those are the moments that heighten the performance and, in the end, make this movie so strong.<br/><br/>Randy (not Robin!) the Ram is a sweet, gentle, lonely man just trying to figure out how to make a life after all these years. His life begs the question if it is better to have glory days to look back on or to have no glory days at all. It is painful watching him desperately trying to connect with someone ... either his angry, estranged daughter (played well by Evan Rachel Wood) or the tired, re-focused, middle-aged stripper played by Maris Tomei. He doesn't know what he wants, he just wants something.<br/><br/>Aronofsky is to be commended for his take on the industry of wrestling. He is quite respectful for these entertainers who work hard, and literally bleed, for their craft. More importantly, he captures the community of wrestlers. These guys care for each other and a bond exists that only they understand. While at an autograph show, Rourke's character catches a glimpse of his future and it's not pretty.<br/><br/>Some of my favorite scenes were: Randy and his daughter re-visiting the desolate boardwalk of yesteryear (analogy for Randy); drinking a beer and re-living the 80's with Tomei; and the fascinating backroom walk to his entry into the deli ... treated just like his walk to the ring at a wrestling event! Aronofsky treats much of this in quasi-documentary style, but Rourke's life is shown, warts and all. We feel his pain after a match and after heart surgery ... and as he is shut down by Wood and Tomei. This is not much of a motivational film, but it is fascinating and not to be missed by those who can appreciate an amazing performance. For fun, go home and put in your DVD of Body Heat or Diner ... compare the Mickey Rourke of 25 years ago to the Randy the Ram of that era. Also, gotta love the cool Springsteen song that ends the film."

","Mickey Rourke has redeemed himself from the sins of 'wild orchid' by delivering a powerful performance in this film. With the only exception of Bruno Ganz (in 'Der Untergang') no other actor even dared to cross the self-limits & rediscover himself in such a way that even the set-rules of acting are broken. Rourke tops my list for the best actor in Oscars this year. Arnofsky on the other hand is all the same - the very best. His cinematic lineage has always put me in awe right from the days of 'pi'. The story is simple yet very astounding, revolving around once-famed wrestler, suffering from the terrible pains of loneliness & anger, denial & self-loathing that follows. Though this film will be in my favorites yet it brought me sadness. It symbolizes the John Locke's 'Tabula rasa' which by rule always & by everyone is filled with dark colors only. In simpler words life becoming a choice to live in or already being in hell.<br/><br/>Arnofsky has created a masterpiece. He has made us face to face with loneliness & the eternal trial of humans to fill it something else, though that something always falling short. Desires are not infinite but there is always a desire for the infinite. All heads down, all hands up for this film. A must must watch."

","The director looks like he enjoyed making this small but excellent film. It has no more clich√©s in it that Requiem. This (The Wrestler) is actually quite an original film in many respects. It takes from fighting/boxing films and flips it with the theatrics of wrestling where you are fighting with yourself and your own physical limitations. An ancient theater. The casting of Rourke is one of the best decisions of leading men in recent memory. He looks the part and is very believable as a wrestler. All his movements and postures in the ring are grand. He owns that place. Both casting of Rourke and Marisa Tomei have a real life parallel to them. I think the film can have wide appeal and do well with Wresling fans because of its authenticity and respect towards the subject matter. Oh, and I like the photography. The cinema-scope works very well in the viewpoints of the characters. A spectral vision is created and takes us there rather than solid, static compositions, the wide format is used in a modern, documentary informed way minus any over shaking that the film thankfully stays away from. <br/><br/>At the end this is a very solid attempt at genre and something very new at the same time.

","Wow, Talk about a comeback role for Rourke. He was born to play this one it seemed. I gotta give credit to Aronofsky for making this documentary style drama. He follows Rourke in multiple scenes with the camera to highlight who the movie is all about. The movie was not simply about wrestling, but about the life of a struggling individual wanting more from life.<br/><br/>The music was perfectly used, held back even, to make the emotions stand out. Also, I loved how in the last fight of the movie Randy's entry was to my favorite Guns N Roses song. It made for a real cool entry I thought.<br/><br/>Mickey Rourke has given us an Oscar worthy performance. Sean Penn stands in his way, and though Penn's performance may have been better, my emotional preference is Rourke. His expressions were excellent, and his character felt so real, everything from the tears, stunts, and injuries. Tomei also gave a really good supporting performance, and could be rewarded with a nomination.<br/><br/>I just wish this movie was getting more buzz for best picture. As of now it's one of the dark horses for the last spot. It could easily replace, and should replace, Slumdog Millionaire or Frost/Nixon. But no matter what occurs, this is a great film."

","If you have a favorite sports star today that you notice might be having a little too much fun, you'd have a good idea what he/she will look like in 20 years ¬ñ if they're still around ¬ñ in 'The Wrestler.' A knock-out (no pun, although, not a fan of wrestling, I'm probably off on this one) performance from Mickey Rourke, one of the year's best, make that, one of the best performances I've ever seen. But, unlike 'Revolutionary Road,' 'Milk,' 'Frost/Nixon' ¬ñ three of the best performance-driven movies of 2008, this one has the pleasure of having an excellent film above the ones mentioned. Again, despite not a pro-wrestling or sports-themed movie buff (especially dislike the based/inspired on a true story/real-events/true events sport-themed, so-called feel good films that ALL BLEND IN), I found myself swept up in the bonding of the sports figures, the ones on the way out and in, the relationship with the fans, and where they end up 20 years after their heyday. Marisa Tomei was excellent as well, as was the 80's soundtrack. And since this is not one of the ""true sports stories"" that ALL END THE SAME, it's refreshing to see an original idea, original dialogue, original take on a sport that's generally not taken seriously. I'm sorry to say, if I had been a fan of the sport, I might have even appreciated this excellent film all the more, especially with the dozens of cameos I might have known. But, I still rated the movie the highest, even without the background knowledge and built in fan recognition. Finally, as I said in the opening, this actually applies to all people and a perfect example of the end results to people unwilling to say no to an unhealthy lifestyle. (Myself included.)"
"RealLiveClaude","8","0","1","3 January 2009"," Wrestling as it is today... Good movie !
","I am a wrestling fan. Used to see the last heyday of wrestling before the takeover of Vince McMahon of all the ""territories""... Today, besides the big WWE circus, this is now what real wrestling is now: condemned to be shown in lowdown arenas, Legion Hall and church basements (like here in Quebec...).<br/><br/>The story of a washed-up wrestler trying to redeem himself after a heart attack was well told. Good performance by Mickey Rourke, which at least does some acting here and the rest of the cast, including a very sexy Marisa Tomei.<br/><br/>For those looking for a wrestler on tour, forget this movie, but you have an idea of what ""indy wrestling"" is today: if it isn't old school, it's hardcore, and it's pretty messy when you deal with the Necro Butcher...<br/><br/>However, it proves one thing: you can't retire from wrestling, it is in your blood, for your whole life...<br/><br/>Recommended for those who would like a close insight of today's wrestling world and its setbacks. I did enjoy, and that's the bottom line..."
"rossoncall","10","0","1","2 January 2009"," A truly amazing film
","As an avid movie watcher, I have seen a great deal of crap and/or awesomeness in my time. It is rare that a gem such as this one pops up in my life and I've got to say that I absolutely loved this movie. The cinematography was perfect, the acting was perfect...in fact, there was not one flaw that I can think of. This film digs right into the heart and sole of the character so deeply that you could swear you know him.<br/><br/>If you're the type who likes to see a movie that feels real and genuine, this is just what you need. There is not one scene that will leave you displeased. Sad, emotional...yes. But definitely not displeased. I don't want to spoil the movie so I won't dive into too many details. But I will say one last thing just to take up some more space.<br/><br/>This movie is freaking super bad-ass! See it!"
"ed-1058","10","0","1","2 January 2009"," Powerful is not a strong enough word!
","This is going to be short and to the point, but all I have to say is that this is one of of not thee greatest film I have ever seen. I spent years wasting my life in the professional wrestling world and this film is as true as it gets. I cannot tell you how any locker rooms I have been in with man a Randy ""The Ram"" Robinsons.<br/><br/>This film is not just for the hardcore wrestling fans tho, this is a compelling story about a one time mega star now forced to living in a trailer, seeking love from an aging stripper, and trying to get his estranged daughter back in his life after a near death experience.<br/><br/>The struggles of this mans life makes for a great film, and deserves any and every award it is nominated for.<br/><br/>I may be a little over dramatic in this statement, but for me, this film was life changing. I cannot wait for it's release on Blu-ray.<br/><br/>This film was panned by WWE Chairman, Vince McMahon, and I know why, this movie was too real for him, and accurately portrays the life of many of his former employees.<br/><br/>I cannot recommend this film enough to anyone, I got a free viewing of this film, but will be front row and center at the ticket line to pay to see it again when it comes to my town (Cincinnati, OH) on Jan 16th."
"IgiS","10","0","1","2 January 2009"," Motion picture that under it's simple title, hides so many layers of common real life emotions
","First of all, let me tell you that those kinds of movies don't happen too often, and when you think about this sort, you know that there's only handful similarly well made productions every decade or so. Like with its straight on title, all the beauty of ""The Wrestler"" lays in its simplicity. This is the story of one man, Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson. He is a Wrestler. His heydays are long gone but he still hangs on to this profession(as I think we may call wrestling) that gave him so much over the years, but also through Randy's absolute dedication, made his life outside the ring rather shallow and empty. We see that being the truth, when after one brutal match(which is shown in very violent way) Randy experiences heart attack, and is told to put his wrestling gigs aside.Then he faces many tough encounters with new reality, like confrontation with his estranged daughter(played beautifully by Evan Reachel Wood) with whom Randy would very much like to make the peace but after all lost years it may not be possible, and we see him doing different types of honest hard work, he would take to make a living. Randy's other interest besides wrestling is his relationship with the stripper named Cassidy(another award worthy performance from Marisa Tomei).She is Randy's maybe only soul-mate to whom he can freely talk about anything. She resembles Randy in that she also does use her body as a way to make money, but to both of them there is more then meets the eye. Thanks to film's low budget you can relate to all the events more then usual. Almost whole think was shot with using hand-held cameras, and it gives you the feeling of authenticity, like you were there with Randy. Music composed by Clint Mansell is very subtle, and we have fair share of famous 80's hard-rock songs. All the parallels between Randy's character and Mickey Rourke's real life are very much intended, probably because of that he was able to play this part so well, almost effortless. As for the wrestling matches there are some very impressive stunts there , and allegedly Mickey Rourke did all his moves by himself, for those show scenes separately he deserves some kind of recognition. It's a very raw and honest movie, you feel for all the characters, and how they interact with each other, partially thanks to those very honest performances, and also by beautiful straightforward direction in which Darren Aranofsky shot this film. It is one not to be missed, you may laugh you may cry, and you will know by the end of it, that you were treated with something special."
"commandercool88","9","0","1","1 January 2009"," Rourke's Heartfelt Return
","Darren Aronofsky has without a doubt proved his worth as one of the great poets of film. After a detour into the metaphysical and downright brilliant excursion of 'The Fountain', Aronfsky has returned to the gritty depths of humanity to deliver an endearing and heartbreaking story. It is an utterly well-made picture, and though there are many reasons to see it, the real success of 'The Wrestler' rests on the battered and bloodied shoulders of one man. Mickey Rourke.<br/><br/>After suffering a heart attack, the once popular but still fierce Randy 'The Ram' stands at one of life's many crossroads. He's told that wrestling with his heart condition will kill him, but retirement doesn't find Randy much better off. Living a life that lacks passion, our gentle giant is stuck in a futureless job and attempts to mend relations with his estranged daughter don't over as planned. His closest acquaintance is a stripper who, while meaning well, is hesitant to move as close as Randy might want.<br/><br/>'The Wrestler' finds itself as a film about redemption in more ways than one. For it is Mickey Rourke's absolutely devastating performance that will stick in your mind for a long time. Not only for its tremendous caliber that will help it go down as one of the greats, but because we really do witness the return of a man who, like Randy, hasn't had an easy life. His perseverance is staggering, his transformation is jaw-dropping. It's a performance that may very well win Rourke an Oscar, a meaty role that will in all likelihood become a career high point.<br/><br/>'The Wrestler' is in almost all aspects an actor's movie. While Rourke deservedly dominates the screen, Marisa Tomei turns heads in a gutsy, baring, but ultimately memorable role. She finds a way to separate her career as a stripper from her life as a mother. Something Randy has not been able to do, and therein lies the tragedy of 'The Wrestler'. Evan Rachel Wood's moving performance as Randy's daughter is filled with anger and grief. And she probably has every right to feel that way. Randy never gave her the life she deserved, and he knows it.<br/><br/>It's a profound film, a heartbreaking film. The story of a man who collides with life head-on. Even if it costs him everything he knows. Aronofsky has given us something truly remarkable that is at times difficult to watch, but never fails to entertain and move us. One of the best film's of the year is also one of the most affecting, and in 'The Wrestler' you will find one of the most mesmerizing and human performances of the year.<br/><br/>More reviews: rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public"

","""What wrestling is above all meant to portray is a purely moral concept: that of justice. The idea of 'paying' is essential to wrestling, and the crowd's 'Give it to him' means above all else 'Make him pay.'"" Roland Barthes, The World of Wrestling<br/><br/>You bet it's fake, professional wrestling, that is. But there's nothing false about Darren Aronofsky's Wrestler, a small, impressive, occasionally pretentious film about a large man, Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson (Mickey Rourke), who suffers in the ring and out. (That blood from razor cuts, barbed wire, and broken glass look so painful!) Like Rocky, Ram is middle-aged and 20 years past his prime fight with The Ayatollah, whom he plans now to rematch. The other rematch with his estranged lesbian daughter, Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood), does not go well though Rourke is believable as an old war horse mending his ways as well as his cuts.<br/><br/>When he courts Stephanie by taking her back to a decrepit amusement pier they used to frequent, the sweetness of his gesture and her willingness to welcome him back after years of neglect are as convincing as any other love scene of 2008. Aronofsky seems not to care that he's beating us up with the symbolic connection of the old park and Ram.<br/><br/>Aronofsky is no stranger to outlying souls, such as his mathematician in Pi, but Ram gets him closer to regular people who make sacrifices for their craft: losing matches, youth, and loves. In another obvious motif, Ram tries to rematch with Cassidy (Marisa Tomei), herself an aging performer, a stripper, who stays connected to her son and tries to make a better life. <br/><br/>When Cassidy spouts a line from The Passion of the Christ, Aronofsky and writer Robert D. Siegel again flirt with the outrageous allusion, this time to Christ's suffering, but somehow it all works because these are authentic characters working their way through tough times themselves without pretensions.<br/><br/>Randy 'The Ram' Robinson: ""In this life you can lose everything you love, everything that loves you. A lot of people told me that I'd never wrestle again, the only one that's gonna tell me when I'm through doing my thing, is you people here."""
