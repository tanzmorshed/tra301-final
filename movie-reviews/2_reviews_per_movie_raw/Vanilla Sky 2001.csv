","I had heard some not too good things about this movie and had probably seen the low score here at IMDb and that's why I had avoided it. Today they showed Vanilla Sky on TV and as I had nothing better to do... and as it turned out, I would have had a hard time finding anything better to do. Vanilla Sky is a frightening, sad and touching movie, actually one of the best I've seen in a while. I was surprised by how I was affected watching it. It's hard to explain, but during the movie your feelings towards the characters and your perception of what is going on changes and it's quite an emotional journey. Vanilla Sky really touched me in a way that is very rare for a movie, or any media for that matter.<br/><br/>I really recommend everyone to watch this movie. Regardless of what you have heard about it."
"udkyle","8","419","530","4 December 2003"," Why people dislike this movie...
","I for one really like this movie for some reasons I'll go into late but I want to touch on why I think people don't like it. First off, there are people out there who just like to hate Tom Cruise. I don't understand it really. Second, Cameron Crowe I think successfully p***es off two groups of movie-goers with this film. The casual, relaxed, ""not looking to think too hard"" group of movie-goers are left confused when the plot takes a complete 180 at the end of the movie. And the deep, philosophical, mystery-fans are devastated when Crowe has one of his characters completely explain the mystery.<br/><br/>This is a good movie. And Tom Cruise does a very good job in it. I think it's probably his best performance from what I've seen all though I haven't seen all of his movies, or even a majority of them probably. The supporting cast is good as well. Penelope Cruz gives a solid performance and Jason Lee was enjoyable.<br/><br/>I like the story, and I think that's what Vanilla Sky is more than anything. It's a mystery, an adventure, and a romantic comedy, but it's mostly just a good story. And it has a lot of philosophical undertones to it, and many similar ideas and stories like this occur in historical philosophy. David Aames (Cruise) is the man that had everything he wanted, more or less lost it, was given a second chance with a catch to regain it all back, and in the end facing his demons and the full scope of what is happening, chooses reality, simplicity, and normality to see if he can finally find the one thing he could never get a grip on: happiness.<br/><br/>Many people were disappointed that Crowe laid out the complete mystery at the end. I think it's necessary. The audience then knows beyond a shadow of a doubt that David is aware of his circumstances and it makes the choice at the end all the more powerful.<br/><br/>And the music in the movie is great. It's probably what makes the movie as enjoyable as it is. Particularly, ""Njosnavelin"" by Sigur Ros, which is an amazing song.<br/><br/>All in all, I'd give it 3 out 4 stars. It's a movie with some substance for those who like to think things through, and a great story for those looking to relax. That ""moderate"" approach is probably why people dislike it so much because it isn't a full blown mystery, or a full blown love story. It mixes and matches different elements and genres."
"Danny_G13","Null","159","200","21 December 2003"," Engaging psychological tale
","Recently the BBC in UK held a poll for worst film ever, and while Titanic *won*, this came 4th. I just don't understand how anyone can dislike this movie...<br/><br/>Vanilla Sky is a dark psychological drama about dreams, reality and 'what might have been'.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is Dave, a yuppie who has it all. He has a 51% stake in his father's company, therefore the majority shareholder, and constantly finds himself in a battle to main his control over the '7 dwarves' who make up the rest of the board. His personal life is a mess, with a shallow relationship with Julie (Cameron Diaz) the closest he gets to love, while his best friend Brian (Jason Lee) who adores Julie sticks by him regardless.<br/><br/>However, on holding a birthday party he's introduced to Sofia (The perfect Penelope Cruz) and falls instantly for her.<br/><br/>This is all very well but the plot is parallel to a side story of Dave wearing a white mask in a cell with Dr McCabe (Kurt Russell) who's accusing him of murder and wants to understand why it happened.<br/><br/>Dave begins on a journey to make sense of his life.<br/><br/>I admit there is a 'Hollywoody' feel to this film, and given it's a remake of a Mexican/Spanish original also featuring Penelope Cruz it's probably disappointing to purists. But only viewing this on its own terms I absolutely love this movie. It keeps you guessing, and the ending is very conclusive.<br/><br/>It may not be to everyone's taste, but I loved it."
"monk_venkman","9","328","457","24 March 2004"," Open Your Eyes
","Vanilla Sky is a 2001 remake of the great 1997 movie, Abre Los Ojos (Open Your Eyes). And in my opinion, a much more human and emotional version. Tom Cruise plays David Aames, a selfish egomaniac who takes other people's emotions for granted, and thinks only of himself. Jason Lee plays Brian Shelby, David's best, and in many ways, only friend. Penelope Cruz plays Sofia Serrano, Brian's girlfriend whom accompanies him to David's birthday party. Cameron Diaz plays Julie Gianni, David's occasional bed buddy. Kurt Russell plays Dr. Curtis McCabe, a psychologist interviewing David. All of their interactions, and the consequences of them, make Vanilla Sky one of the most emotional, and complex thrillers ever made. I won't explain anymore of the plot, because it's far more compelling, the less you know. Ignore all people that call this film too confusing to follow. If you pay attention, you won't be confused. The film is very complex, but not confusing. And in my opinion, one of the best movies ever made."
"fallinginsane","10","172","240","13 September 2004"," Made me think
","""Vanilla Sky"" was a wonderfully thought out movie. Or rather, ""Abre Los Ojos"" was well thought out. I watched that movie late one night, excited about what was to come. I wasn't disappointed. By the end of the movie, I was awstruck. I couldn't get it off my mind. The whole idea of it just blew me away. The ending, was more of a surprise than Shyamalan could ever do. The plot line was also something that kept me interesting through and through. The cast, superb. It was an all around wonderful movie. The kind of movie you can watch again and again and always find something new. I've seen it four or five times and I'm always finding something new. It's a movie to keep you interested forever."
"mindcraft-1","10","170","242","19 August 2006"," Vanilla Sky is dream come true.
","I could not agree more with the quote ""this is one of the best films ever made."" If you think Vanilla Sky is simply a ""re-make,"" you could not be more wrong. There is tremendous depth in this film: visually, musically, and emotionally.<br/><br/>Visually, because the film is soft and delicate at times (early scenes with Sofia) and at other times powerful and intense (Times Square, post-climactic scenes).<br/><br/>The music and sounds tie into this movie so perfectly. Without the music, the story is only half told. Nancy Wilson created an emotional, yet eclectic, score for the film which could not be more suitable for such a dream-like theme (although never released, I was able to get my hands on the original score for about $60. If you look hard, you may be able to find a copy yourself). Crowe's other musical selections, such as The Beach Boys, Josh Rouse, Spiritualized, Sigur Ros, the Monkees, etcetera etcetera, are also perfect fits for the film (Crowe has an ear for great music).<br/><br/>More importantly, the emotional themes in this film (i.e. love, sadness, regret) are very powerful, and are amplified tenfold by the visual and musical experience, as well as the ingenious dialogue; I admit, the elevator scene brings tears to my eyes time and time again.<br/><br/>The best part of this film however (as if it could get any better) is that it is so intelligently crafted such that each time you see the film, you will catch something new--so watch closely, and be prepared to think! Sure, a theme becomes obvious after the first or second watch, but there is always more to the story than you think.<br/><br/>This is easily Cameron Crowe's best work, and altogether a work of brilliance. Much of my film-making and musical inspiration comes from this work alone. It has honestly touched my life, as true art has a tendency of doing. It continually surprises me that there are many people that cannot appreciate this film for what it is (I guess to understand true art is an art itself).<br/><br/>Bottom line: Vanilla Sky is in a league of its own."

","How strange the human mind is; this center of activity wherein perceptions of reality are formed and stored, and in which one's view of the world hinges on the finely tuned functioning of the brain, this most delicate and intricate processor of all things sensory.  And how much do we really know of it's inner-workings, of it's depth or capacity?  What is it in the mind that allows us to discern between reality and a dream?  Or can we? Perhaps our sense of reality is no more than an impression of what we actually see, like looking at a painting by Monet, in which the vanilla sky of his vision becomes our reality.  It's a concept visited by filmmaker Cameron Crowe in his highly imaginative and consciousness-altering film, `Vanilla Sky,' starring Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz.  At the age of thirty-three, David Aames (Cruise) inherits a publishing empire left to him by his father. His fifty-one percent controlling interest, however, has made him something of a marked man, as there are seven members of his board of directors, and each deems himself more worthy than the young Mr. Aames of the lion's share of the company.  And fueling the fires of discontent is their perception that David lacks the focus the job requires.<br/><br/>Admittedly, David likes to play; still, he's in control of the business and does what he sees fit, whether the board (he refers to them as the `Seven Dwarfs') likes it or not, and no one has ever had the courage to challenge him directly.  But during a lavish birthday party in his honor, one of the corporate lawyers, Thomas Tipp (Timothy Spall) warns David that the seven are up to something behind his back.  At the time, however, it's the last thing on David's mind; he's been having a casual affair with a friend, Julie Gianni (Cameron Diaz), but even that moves to the back burner when he meets a woman at his party that he can't get out of his mind.  Her name is Sofia (Penelope Cruz), and after knowing her for only one night, she becomes a pivotal part of his life-- which is about to be turned upside down, as on the morning after his party he makes a decision that will change his life forever.  And he is about to learn that sometimes, there is simply no going back.<br/><br/>Director Cameron Crowe has crafted and delivered much more than just another film with this one; far more than a movie, `Vanilla Sky' is a vision realized.  Beginning with the first images that appear on screen, he presents a visually stunning experience that is both viscerally and cerebrally affecting.  It's a mind-twisting mystery that will swallow you up and sweep you away; emotionally, it's a rush-- and it may leave you exhausted, because it requires some effort to stay with it.  But it's worth it.  Think `Memento' with a driving rock n' roll soundtrack and a vibrant assault of colors proffered by the stroke of an impressionist's brush. There's darkness and light, and sounds that pound and drive until you can feel the blood rushing through your veins and throbbing in your brain. And all played out on a landscape of virtual reality swirling beneath that ever expanding vanilla sky.  Simply put, this one's a real trip; it's exciting-- and it's a mind bender.<br/><br/>As to the performances here, those who can't get past the mind-set of Tom Cruise as Maverick in `Top Gun,' or his Ethan Hunt in `Mission Impossible,' or those who perceive him only as a `movie star' rather than an actor, are going to have to think again in light of his work here.  Because as David Aames, Cruise gives the best performance of his career, one that should check any doubts as to his ability as an actor at the door.  He's made some interesting career choices the past few years, with films like `Magnolia' and `Eyes Wide Shut' merely warm-ups for the very real and complex character he creates here.  And give him credit, too, for taking on a role that dispels any sense of vanity; this is Cruise as you've never seen him before. `Jerry Maguire' earned him an Oscar nomination, and this one should, also-- as well as the admiration and acclaim of his peers.  Cruise is not just good in this movie, he is remarkable.<br/><br/>Penelope Cruz turns in an outstanding, if not exceptional performance, as well, as Sofia, the woman of David's dreams.  There's an alluring innocence she brings to this role that works well for her character and makes her forthcoming and accessible, yet she lacks any hint of mystery that may have added that special `something extra' to the part.  But Crowe knows how to get the best out of his actors, and he certainly did with Cruz.<br/><br/>He also knew what he was doing with Cameron Diaz, who is absolutely vibrant in the role of Julie.  She's never looked better, and fairly sizzles on screen.  But make no mistake, this is no `window-dressing' part, and Diaz delivers a complete package with this character.  The quality of her performance can be measured, in fact, in the impact she makes with rather limited screen time.  And it's the persona she integrates so fully with her innate beauty that makes Julie so unforgettable.  Overall, a terrific job by Diaz.<br/><br/>The supporting cast includes Kurt Russell (Dr. McCabe), Jason Lee (Brian), Johnny Galecki (Peter), Armand Schultz (Dr. Pomerantz), Noah Taylor (Ed), Mel Thompson (`L.E.' Man), Jean Carol (Woman in New York) and John Fedevich (Silent Ed).  About half-way through, this one may have you questioning your own sense of reality; but rest assured, by the end of `Vanilla Sky' all will be revealed.  It's a reality-bender, to be sure, and a wild one; but this is exciting entertainment that offers a satisfying-- and unique-- experience, one you have to see to believe.  It's the essential, and absolute, magic of the movies.  10/10."
"Sontaloso","Null","33","43","27 August 2006"," To me this movie is not about going insane at all......it's much much more....
","This movie made a huge impact on me. When I saw it, and then saw it again numerous times on DVD, I was always very emotionally disturbed by the deep places the movie goes.<br/><br/>I never thought about Tom Cruise being an insane murderer, driven to extremes because of his guilt.<br/><br/>To me, the central message of the movie is that one moment in life, ONE moment, can change things forever. It's a life lesson that smacks you in the face like brick. For David, the one moment is that he has treated this girl like a toy, with no respect, and she's hurt by it, and in her rage and love for him, angrily tries to kill them both because it hurts too much. She can't stand being his love puppet any more. She WANTS to be taken seriously by him, but to David, she's just a toy.<br/><br/>And I absolutely love the way this movie weaves in modern technology as a possible way ""out"" of a bad reality that we have created for ourselves through our own rash decisions. It shows a potentially frightening future of being able to ""live how we wanted to"" after we die, through a prolonged filtered dream life.<br/><br/>To me, this movie is really a mix of techno future, drama, alternate reality, and maybe even slightly fantasy. Not at all a psychological thriller/murder mystery in the least! What happens between him and Sophia, or the supposed murder, is secondary to the central theme of trying to alter one's real life through suicide induced ""after-life"".<br/><br/>I see this as a kind of a ""Heavy Metal"" type graphic novel fantasy story, in which a young man who has a devastating accident and can no longer handle the loneliness and pain of living as a disfigured mutation in society. In desperation, he turns to prolonging his life after he commits suicide, and does it in a very haunting way, the ""lucid dream"" in which he can have whomever he wants as a lover, have whatever life he wants, or should have had if things had not gone so wrong.<br/><br/>I don't think that the tech support man at the end of the movie ruins anything....in fact I like that he explains what happened to David. To me the explanation makes the whole fabric of the story that much more haunting.<br/><br/>To me, the plot was actually pretty straightforward. And I personally feel that his life was completely real up until the point he committed suicide. At that point the company that froze his body switched on the ""lucid dream option"", which begins by Sophia accepting his disfigurement and picking him up off the street and taking him in(the point where David's life is over, and the lucid dream kicks in), and they fall in love all over again. What a lot of movie goers failed to grasp was that David was not DREAMING or hallucinating what he wanted in life while he was still alive....but that half of the movie actually takes place with him already dead.<br/><br/>And another thing that movie goers really failed to grasp onto....was that all that was really happening in the second half of the movie was what the tech guy said it was..a GLITCH! And I love that concept! That maybe the company hadn't worked out fully the technology of the lucid dream, and that things could go wrong in this death/dream state. That's why tech support had to go in and enter David's world just like another character.<br/><br/>I mean think about it...if you are already in a lucid dream state, the only way tech support could reach you is to enter your dream state and explain what is going wrong! I think of it like a very, very weird type of internet support, except YOU are the subject of tech, and the glitch is in your head.<br/><br/>So, for me this movie is a fantastic vision of the regrets we have in life, and the decisions that led up to those regrets, and...and what if.....what if we could actually have a way to take the consequences away, to take the pain away? That girl that slipped away? That job we didn't take? That thing we wanted to say, but never said before our father died? Make it all better? And, what if while we tried to do that, something went wrong with the technology? I just think that simple premise alone makes Vanilla Sky a haunting masterpiece.<br/><br/>Mike H."
"belowzero8","9","82","116","7 December 2007"," Sweet and Sour
","""The sweet is never as sweet without the sour."" This quote was essentially the theme for the movie in my opinion. Tom Cruise plays a young man who was handed everything in his life. He takes things for granted and it comes around full swing in this great movie with a superb twist. This film will keep you engaged in the plot and unable to pause it to take a bathroom break.<br/><br/>Its a movie that really makes you step back and look at your life and how you live it. You cannot really appreciate the better things in life (the sweet), like love, until you have experienced the bad (the sour). The theme will really get you to ""open your eyes"".<br/><br/>Only complaint is that the movie gets very twisted at points and is hard to really understand. I think the end is perfect though. I recommend you watch it and see for yourself."

","I'm from Romania i'll try to speak in English. All i want to say about this movie is that it is and will be my all time number one. Seen it above 30 times at least and will see it for many years now. It has all the little things i like in a movie , it's very touching makes me cry . Shows a whole lot of twisted love things and questions about love and reality , and the true things that matter for different people. It so happens that for me this matters the most , the love , the soul of a man , he's inner being, and this i see in this movie. Perhaps for me it's much more than a motion picture , it's a proof in my mind that it could really exist and that you most make the best out of every moment you live with your soul mate. It's a long way from reality to sci-fi , but .. what if. What if all the capitalism disappeared and economy would go down , would fall? We would all be concerned about other issues and my thought is that , on your death bed , the bigger thing you remember , is not the wealth , not the adventure , not the countries you visited and the people that remember you. But the true friends and your true love and the hope that after you die , all will be god damn perfect and people would be good and care more. WATCH THIS MOVIE and probably it will guide you through your life like it did to me :) Hail from Romania"

","There is not a single movie that blew my mind more than Vanilla Sky, even after watching it for the second or maybe third time. Until half an hour passed, you understand almost everything that is happening, but then you get lost on purpose, the director wants you to get lost, just like Tom gets lost in his life. He drives you left and right, up and down, your starting to lose your patience with the movie and then, pop, your back in the driving seat again, why ?, because wow, you just understood something, you connected a few puzzling scenes and your feeling confident about the movie again. You feel for Tom, you are feeling sad like all of that is happening to you, not in some movie that already lost you a few times, but managed to get you back in the last moment. The ending explains it all, makes everything so perfectly clear, but many things leave you feeling pointless about the movie now, and that is why I don't like the ending. It is to sci-fi, to unreal and to supernatural to be implemented as an ending for this beauty.. but I guess there was not a better option to end the movie then this one..."

I never really watched Cruise movies that much before but after seeing this it shows me his true talent. My favourite part in the movie is the end where it all comes to a big conclusion and he find out the truth. If you have not seen this yet you definitely should give it a try. It's one of those films that once you've started watching it you just got to see it until the end or it will keep you thinking and you will regret it.

","I've seen the movie a few times and every time it seemed better and made more sense. Unfortunately I happened to read some of the comments here and I'm absolutely surprised by the people who wrote them. Obviously their movie culture is so low that they can only appreciate movies like the matrix or Lord of the rings for example which although beautiful in terms of special effects lack any meaning whatsoever. Vanilla sky is a movie which tries to explain the human mind, why dreams turn into nightmares and in the end it is all about choice and making decisions. The characters are amazing. They look almost human. You can't say ""this is the good guy"". Well that's the way it is in real life anyway.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise's character is lost in his own dreams. After all,his life was a dream - handsome, young, rich....but as it often happens dreams do turn into nightmares because most of us lack the ability or the will to control them. And that I think is the message of the movie - you are the master of your own fate, the master of your own life and you (no one else) possess the power to control it. This is a movie about the ""revolution of the mind"", a movie about the freedom of choice and the fear to face an important decision.<br/><br/>The crew of the movie is also incredible. The actors (well at least most of them) do try hard to create the personality of their characters. The music is breathtaking. In many cases it is in absolute contrast with the events, just like in a dream and yet there is a strange symbiosis between the movie and the soundtrack. Just remember the scene where Tom Cruise killed Cruz and the song was ""What if God was one of us"" and I think you'll get the picture.<br/><br/>The end although a bit confusing at first is exactly in it's place - beneath the vanilla sky, the symbol of freedom. It is a logical end to the journey of Cruise's character trough his mind and fantasies - facing his greatest fear. He faces it not to fulfill his dream, but to escape from it and live a complete and real life.<br/><br/>The meaning of the movie is well hidden behind the car crash, the disformed Tom Cruise and the jumping scenes but if you watch really carefully and pay attention you will find much more to it than you expected. It's like the voice in the beginning and in the end is that of the director himself who is trying to tell the viewers to open there eyes. This is my advice to the people who watched ""Vanilla sky"" and didn't like it - Watch it again and OPEN YOUR EYES!!!!!!"

All of the characters are written so beautifully and the acting excellent. The best friend, the father figure, the seven dwarfs and LE all make me watch in awe. I have never been able to watch the final scene on the rooftop without shedding a little tear and I'm a fully grown emotionally in control type of guy.

"giancarlorocks","Null","71","125","15 December 2001"," An Intellectual, Frustrating and Alternative piece of film...
","Times Square is already a sight to behold in itself with all the lights and sound, but imagine the world's most photographed tourist attraction silent. Cameron Crowe manages to shutdown Times Square and captures this magnificent site in what sets the tone for the most mind-bending, headache inducing, multifaceted frustrating film to hit theatres in quite a long time. Director Cameron Crowe adapts the haunting 1997 Spanish Film `Abre Los Ojos' and transforms it into an indescribably brilliant piece of entertainment in Vanilla Sky'. This is not your typical Studio conformist film that will leave audiences with a sense of satisfaction, but rather with a sense of shock, interest, sadness, confusion and utter disbelief  simultaneously. Tom Cruise plays David Aames, a womanizing millionaire who becomes horribly disfigured after his obsessive lover (Cameron Diaz) decides to commit suicide by driving herself off a bridge - with him in the car. The crash creates a world where nothing is as it seems that has David s story throw the viewers into one intellectual hurdle after another.<br/><br/>Note: the key word in the previous sentence was intellectual. If anyone expects a timid, bland conventional film, they will be disappointed. This is not a romantic film, nor a formulaic film. But it is an exercise into the intellectual psyche of our David Aames character as he plays back the sequences that lead to his arrest for a murder. As aforementioned, intellectualism is the key to this film. Viewers must enthral themselves into this film to appreciate its unique blend of flashback sequences, musical incorporation as only Crowe can do and mind-bending storytelling that throws you a curve at every unexpected turn. Before people begin to think that everyone will love this film, you must not make my words control your opinions. Many will completely dislike this film, in fact, I am sure only a minority will actually truly see this film for what it is. Not since David Fincher's 'Fight Club' has there been a film so out there' that remains engrained within your thoughts long after the film and thus remains open to such misunderstandings. Cameron Crowe directs Cameron Diaz in a short; albeit juicy role, as Aames' jealous casual squeeze that begins to feel threatened at the appearance of Aames' interest in the mystical Sophia (Penelope Cruz). This emergence of interest between Aames and Sophia causes Diaz's character to spiral into a whirlwind of rage as the movie propels itself into a different stratosphere after the simple yet effectively shot car crash. If one were to study the acting within the film, the attention will be directed towards Cruise's performance as we get to see both sides of this womanizing yet desperately lonely figure who searches for something more.<br/><br/>And as audiences leave the theatre, they too will want something more. They will want answers. This film makes for hours of interesting debate and conversation as every scene can be meticulously deconstructed and analyzed as it culminates into one of the most absolutely twist endings in recent memory. Yet, that it is not to say that the film contains no imperfections. Crowe makes no secret of shmaltzing' his way through pacing and character development in the film and making sure we fall for the wrong clues. Furthermore, he enjoys capturing his characters in their most brutal and defenceless moments. Also, Crowe wants to hammer the notion that our main character is not what he seems. Also, many might find the film pretentious for its slow pacing and tedious flashback story telling, which I myself found a turn off and took some time getting used, but one cannot deny the brilliance of the film. Without a doubt, many will criticize the film for its' ambitiousness that it might not have achieved according to some, but this is just too great of a character piece to dislike. It is haunting, it is disturbing and it is exquisitely filmed with some great moments of cinematography notice NYC's archaic overhead shots, Bob Dylan's Album Cover brought to life and Cruise's fall to earth in the film's unravelling moments. Notwithstanding the film's frenetic back and forth storytelling, and it's over the top character development, this film must not go unwatched.  See it for Cruise's performance, or see it for the direction, but see the film. This is a film that will leave many baffled throughout the entire third act, making us hang on every detail that may or may not unravel the film's explanation.<br/><br/>After viewing the film, many will feel let down or even mislead by its' seemingly surreal sci-fi ending which may turn on or turn off viewers. Total Recall' may come to mind for those film buffs who really studied the film and understood it to its' fullest extent, yet Vanilla Sky' will long not be forgotten as the film that even if one were to follow the tagline Open Your Eyes', they still won't exactly know what the hell happened.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Giancarlo's Rating: ***1/2"

This movie was not the best the first time I watched it, but after about 3 more times I decided that this is one of the best films that I have ever seen. It takes place in New York, and progresses on through his lifestyle. He discovers a delimma in his life with his girlfriend (Diaz). He goes through a state of depression and then an outgoing blend of imagination. This film was beyond my expectations, and is one of Cruise's best films ever!"

","From the point of view of pure cinema, it is quite impossible to make any review of this film: `Vanilla sky' is the carbon copy of the Spanish film `Abre los ojos,' translated practically verbatim, and with the only difference of a higher percentage of in-your-face special effects (including the typical never-ending fall from a building) that, if they don't add anything to the film, they certainly add a lot to the budget of Digital Domain, the company responsible for most of the special effects. What is left for us to do is to reflect on the meaning of such an operation. We can't honestly call it a remake because of the temporal closeness of its antecedent (Abre los ojos was released in 1997), and of the consequent lack of the `cultural distance' necessary to any reinterpretation operation. We can't call it an homage to a genre (a la Brain de Palma in `Blow Out,' just to make an example) because the referent is too specific, and the carbon copy quality of `Vanilla Sky' too evident.<br/><br/>So, what is left? The producers, obviously, believed that the story would appeal to the American public, for otherwise they wouldn't have spent a considerable amount of money filming it but, in this case, wouldn't have been simpler to release the original in AMC theaters around the country? The only explanation I can find, one that is rather insulting for the American public, is the following. Hollywood producers believe that the mainstream spectator will not see a film unless it falls completely within the expected (and very restricted, Hollywood canons). So, the setting has to be a familiar American setting (New York instead of Madrid) and there has to be the usual sprinkle of known American actors (Tom Cruise). But, most important, the dialog has an undefinable Hollywood quality: just the mix of witty, sad, and sugary to which Hollywood films have accustomed the American public.<br/><br/>This film, in other words, is an explicit insult: Hollywood is telling us that they got us so use to their style of crap that the only way for us to go see a film is to make it into crap.<br/><br/>What is truly sad is that they might be right: Vanilla Sky was a discrete success. On the other hand (and I quote Barnum paraphrasing Mencken): `Nobody ever lost money by underestimating the intelligence of the American public.'"

The scene between Cruise and Cruz where they draw each other to Peter Gabriel's 'solisbury hill' is beautiful.<br/><br/>There is too much to say about the genius of this film.

","I saw this movie because I like Tom Cruise.  I feel he is a terrific actor. I never know that Keith Campbell was the actor who was in the scenes where Tom wore a mask and interacted with Kurt Russell.  Anyway, this movie is a love story intwined with some serious sci fi.  Tom Cruise plays a cocky 30 something year old who falls for Penelope Cruise (no relation to Tom......yet).  However, at one point Tom Cruise is in a horrible accident and must learn to live with his face all scarred up and disfigured.  The twists turn like crazy after this.  Jason Lee from DOGMA is superb as Tom's carefree friend.  The acting is great, the music is wonderful and the photography is unbelievable.  The end was criticized by many but I actually liked it.  Yes, this movie does deliver the goods.  7 thumbs up!"

","Abre Los Ojos was a great film, with solid performances, haunting atmospherics and a unexpected, original ending. Vanilla Sky is the remake, a film that tries to copy Abre Los Ojos and fails rather miserably.<br/><br/>In fact, you can say it very simple : if you have only watched Vanilla Sky, than you're in for a movie that reaches some nice intellectual heights for an American movie with an original ending. But, if you see this movie and then see the original (or if you had already seen that one), Vanilla Sky suddenly becomes a quite lame movie. Which is a shame actually, because I like Tom Cruise and certainly because he has given the attention to Amenabar he deserves. Cruise has always been to me one of better actors in America. But Cruise should have known that the quality of the original could never have been injected in the remake. There are a lot of things which make the original better, but now I'm going to give the 3 main points why this movie is way underneath the original :<br/><br/>1)the performances : how hard Cruise tries, he never puts as much tragedy and quality in his role as Eduardo Noriega. But this goes for every actor here (also Cruz, who had a more sharp, vivid character in the original)<br/><br/>2)the approach : the original is more scary, leaves more to the imagination of the audience and has a better ending (yes, vanilla sky manages to remove some of the intensity of the original ending!!)<br/><br/>3)the music!!! : although the songs on their own are good (2 songs from my fave band REM), the music is just totally inappropriate and actually ruins some of the scenes. you know what i'm talking about when you can compare the 2 movies<br/><br/>therefore 1 advice : just go see Abre Los Ojos and wait until Vanilla Sky comes on television, late at night. Ironically, that's what the special featurette on the VHS edition suggests!!!"

","The original ""Abre los ojos"" was a great but not perfect movie. It had a bit of a dragging beginning and especially middle-part. Unfortunately this remake suffers from the same problem and is even a bit worse with its dragging parts. In the first hour and an halve it's still mainly unclear where the movie is heading to and makes perhaps a bit of a pointless impression. Just like in the original, the ending compensates for this even though the ending for this movie isn't build up as a good and executed as in the original was the case. <br/><br/>Yes, it's a pointless remake. ""Abre los ojos"" is perfectly watchable for everyone. You don't have to be a fan of European cinema to enjoy that movie. The original is also just a tiny bit better but that doesn't mean that ""Vanilla Sky"" itself is a bad movie on its own. It has some great acting performances from Tom Cruise and especially Cameron Diaz in it. Quite honestly, I have never seen Diaz acting better in any other movie. Other well know actors in this movie are Penélope Cruz (who reprises her role from the original but she isn't halve as good in this movie as she was in the original.), Kurt Russell, Noah Taylor, Jason Lee and Timothy Spall with who Cruise later teamed up again for ""The Last Samurai"".<br/><br/>The atmosphere is good. New York is the perfect background for the movie its story. The story is good and surprising enough for everyone to enjoy even though at times it tries too hard to be confusing.<br/><br/>It's a good movie but you're still better of watching the original. Are the many difference between this movie its story and that of the original? Hardly, both movies are very similar with the story, sequences and even dialog.

","CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is David Aames, a playboy who has a 'f*** -buddy' played by Cameron Diaz. It is fairly obvious from the start that Julie wants more commitment than David is prepared to give, while he salves his conscience by telling himself that she is just a friend who he has sex with occasionally. At David's birthday party he is mesmerised by the beautiful Sofia (Cruz) and spends a perfect night with her and when they part in the morning both believe it is the beginning of 'true love'. <br/><br/>Everything starts to go badly wrong though, when David is confronted by Julie on leaving Sofia's flat. Having not had sex with Sofia, he lets his d**k rule his head and gets into Julie's car, thinking that they are going to have sex one more time. She however has other plans, and commits suicide by driving over a bridge, leaving David horribly disfigured. All pretty normal stuff so far.<br/><br/>Eventually he builds an idyllic life with Sofia, but starts to have psychotic episodes where Sofia 'turns into' Julie, culminating in David killing Sofia believing she was Julie. He ends up in jail where he is helped by kindly psychologist played by Kurt Russell.<br/><br/>Upshot is that in reality David did not have this life with Sofia, he was dreaming it all. He had really topped himself. But had had his body frozen and was in some kind of permanent dream until his subconscious told him to 'ask' to be unfrozen which is where the film ended. <br/><br/>Phew."

","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>I was prepared to not like this film; Crowe too consistently centers his vision on the cheap shot. And Cruise -- well, it is hard to be an intelligent actor when you're as dumb as a flagpole knob. I found my worst fears to be true, but also found some strong, really strong elements that make this worth watching.<br/><br/>First the bad. Most films are built on other films; some -- especially recently -- openly quote other films. Some of these are also in the category of films about constructed realities, and that's when things can get interesting: you go to a film to construct a reality for you, and the story is about constructing a reality. Often these fold with sophistication. But here they do this intrinsically intelligent thing in a fifth grade dumb way. Not Monet, but paint by the numbers.<br/><br/>The film is about fantasy love and deciding between lovers. Rather than quote 'Jules and Jim' on this in a light way as anyone else would: Crowe puts a floor-to-ceiling poster in Cruise's bedroom, then when a voice ('tech support') explains that the constructed images were taken from movies, we see an actual clip. Those of us who Crowe targets would immediately recognize the quote of Bob Dylan's most famous album cover. But instead of quoting it like Greenaway would use a famous painting, we are walked through it with chalk.<br/><br/>Patronizing. Embarrassing. Discouraging. Does he think we all move lips when reading?<br/><br/>But there are two really fascinating things. I believe that Crowe's imagination is based in popular music first, with the image to follow, and actors and story getting dragged in a matter of course. So the effect of the music is more powerful than any I recall. He deftly binds it, even having Cruise take up a song at one point. This is the deepest use of Dylan in a long time. For those of us that are Crowe's age, there is a cool take on the Beatles: in the late sixties, the game was that drugs could help you create your own reality. The Beatles provided three alternative worlds for you to choose. It really was a matter of pervasive discussion about choosing (or 'liking') John, Paul or George.<br/><br/>Once the topic comes up in the film, everything from there can be seen as making a choice. John would have stayed in fantasyland. George would have declared the whole thing irrelevant and opted out. Paul would have gone back to the 'real' world. The film ends with Paul's song. Now that's the kind of near-subtlety that's missing in the story at large.<br/><br/>The other thing is no small matter. It purely blew me away, using a cinematic effect I have never experienced before. The whole film is storytelling by reference; what is new is storytelling by direct reference to characters previously played by the cast!<br/><br/>Start with Alicia Witt and work outwards from the center. (Alicia was the receptionist at LE, named Libby who is the first person involved in the dream mechanics.) She played an identical, small center as the whorehouse pianist in 'Liebestraum' (get the name?), also as the fulcrum of folded visions.<br/><br/>Diaz played the shunned girlfriend in the last popular film dealing with constructed realities, 'Malkovich.' Russell plays Douglas playing the character who recreates the narrative. It is the complement of his role in 'Wonder Boys,' where he was the creator, but real; and a complement of a different sort of him in 'The Game,' where he was the target, not the creator. His work here and in 'Boys' are knowingly referential to his other roles. Very tight selfreferential acting. Kudos to him, it makes up for a whole previous life of selfindulgent frippery. (Made right by his finding his own film Latin love.) <br/><br/>And then there is Cruise himself. 'Eyes Wide Shut' is this very same movie (so Kubrick even said in reference to the Spanish original), but with no quarter given to the less astute viewer. How cool that he would come to this very much dumber version while his exwife went to something more elaborately and cinematic ally selfreferential in 'Moulin Rouge,' (a real thrill that should be seen right after either 'Eyes' or 'Little Voice').<br/><br/>And finally we have Cruz, whose reference is to an external movie of a different type: this same film. Except the original is more a film where this is a composite of films. She plays her role not in this film, but here in reference to there as if she herself was Jeanne Moreau. And if there ever was a case of films constructing reality, how sweet to have Tom and Penny fall in 'love.'"

","I was originally very curious about this film when it first came out because I loved the original, Abre Los Ojos was enthralling melodic and enchanting, and Vanilla sky tried very hard but it just kept missing the mark.<br/><br/>Even when you compare the amazing Penelope Cruz's two performances there was so much more in the first film. She had this sweet haunting eloquence that was not present in the latter. Then we come to Tom Cruise who can ofttimes be so hit and miss with his acting (yes I know this will earn me scorn, but its true), there are films he's done where he is brilliant, The Last Samurai, Born on the 4th of July. This felt like one of his more pedestrian performances, much could be said for Cameron Diaz in this as well.<br/><br/>Perhaps if I had not seen Abre Los Ojos my opinion of this would have been vastly different I really can't be sure, but it was sad for me because I desperately wanted to like this."

","If English speaking cinema-goers could learn how to read subtitles, we would be spared having to watch remakes of films that were made perfectly well in the first place. There is nothing particularly wrong with Crowe's version, and if it had been an original piece of work I would be hailing it as a challenging, left-field, atypical Hollywood product. However, comparison has to made with Amenabar's film, which in my opinion is superior in almost all aspects. The main protagonist of ""abre los ojos"", Cesar, is an unlikable character, whom it is difficult to warm to. Contrast this with Cruise's David, all of whose actions have some reason other than his being a spoilt playboy. Crowe, who is a filmmaker I admire, has lost all the ambiguity, and a good deal of the mystery, of the Spanish original. He spells out everything,as if a multiplex crowd could not be expected to draw its own conclusions, or even leave the theatre without any conclusion. I would compare this to ""Donnie Darko"", where the movie seemed so much better before everything was clarified on the DVD release. So my wish for Hollywood is to stop plundering other nations' film archives, and for English speakers to overcome their prejudices against movies in other languages."
"DocFilm","1","39","87","15 December 2006"," Why bother?
","A remake of Alejandro Amenabar's Abre los Ojos, but this time with a living, breathing mask as a lead. For the dubious advantage of an English sound track, we endure Tom Cruise's soulless performance, as usual, with zero depth. Yes, the character is identified with his persona, but we usually are given some character underneath that to hold our interest. His empty posturing negates any erotic energy that could have been between his character and Cruz or Diaz.<br/><br/>There is an acting exercise that involves using masks to free the actor to enrich his presentation of character by verbal and body language means. Cruise's masking only painfully emphasizes his inadequacy as an actor. Do see the 1997 original Amenabar Open Your Eyes!"
"tdrish","7","2","2","7 February 2019"," a twist here, a twist there, ONE MAJOR twist, makes one twisted movie
","Pay attention very carefully, and I promise you....you still will not be able to figure this one out. The ONE MAJOR TWIST slaps you across the face like an angry mother, and leaves you standing slack jawed ( You won't see it coming, unless someone spoiled it for you.) The problem with Vanilla Sky is that I can admire the creativity used here, and I can give credit where credit is due. However, where do you draw the line in the sand, and say that your film is already unique, that you don't have to go out of your way to make it even more out of the norm then it is. Simply put: I thought this movie was a little too messed up for the average audience to watch. If I found any other complaints with the film, I do not remember it, its been awhile since I watched this, as it is an older title. Sometimes, a line has to be drawn, otherwise, the way I see it, it prevents your film from being enjoyable. It's not saying that this wasn't enjoyable. To an extent, it was. It's not just one that leaves you, wanting others to see it too. ""DID YOU SEE VANILLA SKY YET?"" It's not happening. Vanilla Sky is just one of those films that just served its purpose in its time era, and that was it. It quickly evaporated, not leaving even a trace of evidence as being anything remotely associated with an understanding, or even compassionate audience that supports all the work done here. Let's face it, its clear they worked hard on this film. From what I remember, all hearts and souls were poured into this...maybe even a little too much. ( This was the movie where Penelope...oh, never mind!) To even give away a summary of the film would be spoiling it, as it may and will give away some of the key points to the film. It's just all about how its put together. Sure, it will all come together, but it leaves a picture of a puzzle where some of the pieces were forced in that doesn't belong there. I can say this, the cinematography was amazing, in my opinion, maybe even the best of any film I have seen in 2001. The film excels, and then it seems to take a step back, and the minute it gets boring, it seems to decide to excel again by relying on another twist, and weather or not this twist works or not, it still leaves you watching. It leaves you wondering, what's going to happen next? It's a mystery, but it's a psychological mystery more then anything. I can't say anything more without spoiling the milk here, so if this sounds like your cup of coffee or tea, please drink up....and enjoy. Or at the very least, enjoy some stunning performances."

","After seeing Vanilla Sky on opening night i left the theatre with a feeling in my got that basically was telling i saw a movie that was different, compelling, thought-provoking, and wondefully crafted. I haven't had this feeling since American Beauty. I've seen some good films since then don't get me wrong but I need to tell you that a film strikes a core with you when you know that it's one step closer to taking cinema to the next level. American Beauty did that in my opinion and now Vanilla Sky is setting a new trend in this evolution of film.<br/><br/>The plot is too difficult to describe because i'm afraid i may give too many things away. One must go into this film without knowing any of the plot-twist. Just know that i agree with someone else that posted a comment who said the film is broken up into 3 sections: Tom Cruise as the ultimate playboy with everything going for him, His downfall, and finally the reality vs. dreams aspect of the film. All these elements are very important to the film because they shape the picture once it reaches its conclusion. During these sections several different themes are araised. During the first section the concept of What is casual sex? is addressed. Cameron Diaz delivers one of the best lines in the film that sums up this concept: ""When you sleep with someone your body makes a promise even if don't"". During the second section we get the whole vanity issue. After his accident with Diaz he is horribly disfigured. One has determine if he choses not to show his face for awhile because he feels Sofia(Penelope Cruz) won't like him or if he's simply vain. The final section is by far the most interesting and that is what is reality? Is it one big dream? Is it one big nightmare? Questions like these are addressed during the duration of Vanilla Sky and i for one love a film that can make me think about its many themes.<br/><br/>Critics who have bashed this film all said it was too confusing. Sorry to say it but they really need to ""Open Their Eyes"" and see the big picture. Maybe some of these critics aren't open-minded enough to reach into their psyche and try focus on the questions that this film is giving them.<br/><br/>As a filmmaker i think this is Cameron Crowe's best film because it's his most ambitious. I agree with others that his other films like ""Jerry Maguire"" and ""Almost Famous"" are good because there is a piece of himself that is detectable in the film. However with Vanilla Sky he is going beyond his limits as a filmmaker to craft a truly magnificent film and if you think about it all the characters in the film you can kinda identify with so there is most likely a piece of him in all of these characters.<br/><br/>Vanilla Sky wouldn't work half as well without the capable actors that are present in this film. Tom Cruise is quite good here because he has to play 3 different ""characters"" throughout the film: the playboy, the recluse when he's disfigured in the accident, and a man struggling with determining what is real and what isn't. This could possibly be one of his best performances and probably his most ambitious work as an actor.<br/><br/>Penelope Cruz is actually decent as Sofia(pointing out that i haven't seen the spanish language version of the film which she is also in). I've never really been a fan of hers. Her films don't really leave a lasting impression on me, with the exception of ""Blow"", which i found her to be annoying in actually. However here she's quite adorable with a bitting sense of humor. Her and Tom share an unforced chemistry and it makes it quite clear why they're now a pair in real life.<br/><br/>Kurt Russell is good in the film as well. His scenes are all shared with Tom Cruise so it's very important that they share some kind of chemistry to make their scenes work and in the end they do. Jason Lee is quite funny as Tom's best friend in the film and he brings with him a charm that is present in all of his roles.<br/><br/>FINALLY!!!!! we have Cameron Diaz who gives her bestformance to date in a small yet pivotal role in the film. She has to convey anger, sympathy, and all around weirdness all at one time during certain scenes and she just carries herself so well. The scene with her and Tom in the car is both intense and bizzare.(*SPOILER*) There is also two key moments where in the second half of the film, she has to mimic penelope cruz and she does an amazing job. I was quite impressed shows that she deserves that $20 million dollar paycheck she's getting for Charlie's Angels 2.<br/><br/>I'm going to wrap up my review bt i swear i can't stop talking abut this film. It's just such a beautifully crafted film and i'm so glad that a film like this is out right now. The ads for this film are quite misleading and think people that see it will be pleasantly surprised or quite disappointed because they were expecting something a little more simple. This could be one of those misunderstood films like A.I. However, i sure hope this doesn't get lost in the shuffle.<br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>*Note: There is a really interesting scene in the beginning where Tom Cruise is running through Time Square in New York that was quite interesting to watch. What a site to see no one walking through Time Square. Quite eerie."

","Vanilla Sky shows that a remake of a European movie doesn't automatically suck. This is largely because Vanilla Sky is pretty much a scene-by-scene copy of the original Spanish Abre los Ojos. The unique thing is, they do a much better job than the Spanish creators. Abre los Ojos get's credit for their cool idea and for a good movie, but Vanilla Sky takes that material and creates more than a brain-twister; it's simply an amazing movie.<br/><br/>While the original had good actors, Vanilla Sky has better ones. Maybe it's because it's in English, but I think it's more than that. Tom Cruise plays the role of his lifetime, very believable and also likable as David Aames, the man with everything he could ever wish for. If you think Cruise is just a pretty face, just wait and see and the movie will prove you wrong. Penelop Cruz, returning from Abre los Ojos to repeat her role as Sofia, is cute as a button but in no way superficial. Cameron Diaz is simply scary and shows she handles a dramatic role excellently. The rest of the cast is also very good, down to little details.<br/><br/>Direction is nice, with occasional quick cuts but mostly just solid and still interesting. New York always looks good on film and Vanilla Sky is no exception. There is a spectacular scene in the start of the movie that perfectly sets the mood for the movie.<br/><br/>The biggest difference between Abre los Ojos and Vanilla Sky is the soundtrack. While Abre los Ojos had an alright soundtrack, Vanilla Sky's one is simply amazing, well worth buying actually. Every scene has a fresh, interesting and suiting choice of music, many songs so out- there for the scene but still very effective. ""Good Vibrations"" is a good example of a song that really shouldn't work, but does.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a mystery with some surreal overtones and a very satisfying ending(yes, it all makes sense in the end!), look no further."

","I`ve never seen the Spanish movie ABRE LOS OJOS on which VANILLA SKY is based but do recall that everyone who has seen the original European movie destest this Hollywood remake . I will be honest in saying that I absolutely loved this version first time I saw it . In fact it came close to beating BLACK HAWK DOWN as my second favourite release from 2001 ( FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING being my outstanding favourite movie from that year ) but then when I saw it a second time I was far less impressed <br/><br/>***** POSSIBLE SPOILER ***** <br/><br/>Because the plot twist at the end this is not a movie that stands up to repeated viewing . In many ways it`s like watching a whodunnit where you know fine well who the murderer is which means all the suspense of working out what`s happening to Tom Cruise`s character has totally evaporated , it`s to all intents and purposes a one trick pony . It should also be pointed out that by 2001 the premise of this movie was starting to go stale since the central idea of TOTAL RECALL and THE MATRIX and its sequels have similar ideas , and watching it again I do get the impression that it`s a rather shallow film despite - Or because of - the director putting in a large amount of pop culture into the proceedings . I should also point out Tom Cruise seems to have a problem playing such a bitter and twisted character , yeah he was a revelation in BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY but can`t seem able to inject enough anger onto his on screen performance here<br/><br/>
But no doubt a lot of women hired this on video simply because it starred Cruise . It`s not really fair that one man can be so good looking especially since the only film star this reviewer resembles is Gollum from THE TWO TOWERS . I can`t help also noticing that most of the comments from people who hate this movie are male . I honestly believe this comes down to wives watching this on video in the comfort of their home , dragging their husband to bed as soon as the closing credits start , making wild passionate love and screaming "" TOM "" at that most intimate climatic moment . Well Ive got a question for you ladies - Who do you think your husband was fantasizing about during that mind blowing sex session ? Was it Penelope Cruz or was it Cameron Diaz ?"
"Infofreak","Null","19","40","2 January 2002"," Not much to Crowe about!
","First thing is I must admit to not having seen 'Abre Los Ojos', so I can't comment on how much of this is a straightforward remake, or whether any of it is different or original . 'Vanilla Sky' begins as a murder mystery, but that is just a ruse, it is in fact more Phildickian than Hitchcockian. Any fan of PKD's mind-blowing work, specifically 'Ubik', 'A Maze Of Death' and 'Flow My Tears The Policeman Said', bits of which 'Vanilla Sky' share some similarities to, will feel more at home with this kind of material than 'Jerry Maguire' fans. <br/><br/>I have two major problems with 'Vanilla Sky', and both of them I blame on Cameron Crowe, a director who fails to set my world on fire. Apart from the flawed but entertaining 'Almost Famous' I haven't liked much of his output, which to me is basically commercial pap. With this movie he is obviously trying to expand his range, and succeeds to a certain degree, but still doesn't entirely pull it off. <br/><br/>My first problem is Crowe's direction which is disjointed, clumsy and ultimately turns potentially fascinating material into a bore. My other problem was the distracting and ridiculous use of music. It was almost like Crowe went through his record collection and insisted on putting in his favourite bits, regardless of whether it made any cinematic sense or not. Maybe he was going for a similar eclectic feel that the Coen's achieved in 'The Big Lebowski', more than likely, looking at the subject matter, it was trying to be a comment on pop culture and the media ala Trent Reznor's superb musical collage in 'Natural Born Killers'. Whatever the motivation it fell flat on its face, and almost single handedly ruined this movie for me.<br/><br/>Ultimately 'Vanilla Sky' is neither a masterpiece, nor a complete turkey. Crowe is no Kubrick, Cronenberg or Lynch, and this kind of concept needs someone of that vision and creative originality to truly soar. It is interesting in places, irritating in others, and dull for too much of the time. Nice try, worth a look for sure, just don't have high expectations. This year's 'The Matrix', but not as good."
"telmah77","4","8","14","4 February 2005"," Abre Los Ojos is better
","Vanilla Sky is the Hollywoodized, dumbed down version of Abre los Ojos (Open Your Eyes). And a lot louder. It's not bad for being a Hollywood movie, but its merits come from what it mercilessly rips off from the original. It even copies shots, editing, and formats (even a flash-black in grainy black and white!). And PenÃ©lope Cruz plays the same role in both.<br/><br/>I consider myself intelligent enough to figure out the plot without being hit in the head with it, so I prefer the more obscure, ambiguous original. It's also a lot more suggestive, rather than the expensive, explicit Vanilla Sky. There is no ILM in Spain, so they make up for the lack of special effects with interesting gaps and well constructed suspense.<br/><br/>Overall, I believe this is a meddling remake, which does not really add much interesting material to the original (nor get rid of its flaws). It's on the line of the Psycho remake, and we know how that turned out.<br/><br/>Yet I am Spanish, so there's also a bit of a bias here. Only a bit, though."

","This is another one of those films about the human mind and the content therein ... memories, dreams, emotions, perceptions, what is real and what is not. Hollywood has been there before, many times. In ""Vanilla Sky"" the setting is modern day New York City. The main character is David Aames, a smug, self-satisfied, wealthy playboy who is heir to a publishing empire. He's a man who has it all, until an unfortunate event changes him forever.<br/><br/>The best approach to this film is to go with the flow, and not try to analyze it too much. The story gets complicated and confusing. The narrative jumps back and forth. There are many flashbacks. Interpretations vary as to the film's ""meaning"". And therein lies my main problem with the story. When filmmakers try to cover too much philosophical ground, and go deep into the human psyche, the end result is usually ... mush. This film would have been better if the screenplay had focused on one or two philosophical points only. As is, the film's complex subject matter and disjointed structure convey not insight but confusion.<br/><br/>The screenplay aside, other technical components run the gamut from good to awful. Cinematography is probably the strongest element of the film, and includes some creative camera shots of Manhattan. Special effects are effective, and without being intrusive. And production design is impressive. On the other hand, the film's editing contributes to a confused plot. And the background music is very, very weak. As to the acting, well, I don't even want to talk about it ...<br/><br/>Compared to other contemporary films, ""Vanilla Sky"" is neither better nor worse, but about average. Seeing it once is probably enough."
"bob the moo","Null","11","21","19 March 2002"," A lesson in excess Â– not a patch on Abre les Ojos!
","David has everything his heart desires having inherited a huge publishing company from his father at a young age.  With women he trades on his easy charm and good looks Â– stringing as many along as possible without commitment, the build up being as good as the sex that comes with conquest. At a party he avoids one lover, Julie, by striking up a conversation with Sophia Â– going to her home and spending the whole night talking and laughing.  The next morning he leaves her flat to find that Julie is waiting for him.  He gets in her car but during a fight, she crashes Â– killing her and badly disfiguring him.  He struggles with his loss of beauty until a new surgery comes along that offers the chance of restoring his looks Â– however it also messes with his mind to the extent that he appears to mix dreams and reality.  David tells his story to McCabe during a physiological review that will set the basis for his plea during his impending murder trial.<br/><br/>To set out my stall Â– I saw Abre Los Ojos before I saw Vanilla Sky.  I say this because I imagine that most negative reviews come from those who have seen the original and most good reviews come from those who have not seen it at all.  I don't intend to buck this trend.<br/><br/>I can't criticize the story because at heart, it is a good story.  It is a little complex and dark, but it's a compelling, disorientating story none the less.  But we know this already Â– we saw it in the original movie (which I gave a 9 out of 10!).  So that Vanilla Sky has a good story at it's heart is maybe not quite so remarkable a feat.  Crow monkeys with the story slightly  and alters the mood of the ending just enough to be irritating to those of us who didn't see any flaws that needed fixing Â– but this is a remake not a copy and that's his right.<br/><br/>However he does tend to copy the original scene for scene Â– in some cases shot for shot, again that's not a big problem for me as he simple seems to be saying that he can't improve on what has gone before and hence won't even try.  No Â– my main problem is with the adding of stuff.  Vanilla Sky runs about 20/30 minutes longer than the original and it's in this padding that I had a problem.  The film knows that an American audience is not used to thinking things out for itself Â– hence we have constant references to Benny the dog etc, almost as if we're not smart enough to make the connections ourselves.  The padding doesn't add anything of value Â– it extends scenes needlessly and adds baggage to scenes that were fine in the first place. The perfect example being the nightmare scene at the start with an empty Manhattan Â– Crow fills this with quickly cut visuals like a pop video, taking away from the tension of the scene.<br/><br/>In the reviews for this all anyone seemed to be shouting about was what an awesome soundtrack Crow had put together and, yes, it is made up of a diverse range of very good songs Â– however a soundtrack is not just about making a CD that's going to sell, it needs to work in the movie.  Here Â– it doesn't work at all.  Almost all the music seems out of place Â– as if someone in the cinema had just turned on their stereo.  The scene where David discovers what's really going on was sickeningly tense in the original Â– here it is smothered by the Beach Boy's `Good Vibrations', does anyone think this scene works?  That's one example but there are plenty of others where the music destroys any sense of mood and just seems out of place.<br/><br/>The mood is another problem Â– the original was very dark.  Here the mood is quite upbeat, very Hollywood.  The soundtrack doesn't help but it's made worse by the performances.  When Noriega played David/Cesar, he wasn't a totally likeable character Â– unloving, vain and with a smarmy charm Â– after the accident he was pathetic and desperate.  Cruise comes across like a movie star rather than a person Â– he seems to want to flash his well built chest and beautiful smile in every scene, this stops us noticing his failings as a person because his character seems to stop at the smile. After the accident Cruise doesn't want to become pathetic or desperate Â– instead he clowns in a half pathetic way but never lets his character be pushed to the very edge for any length of time Â– this stops us caring about him, he just doesn't seem a real person.  The other Cruz is ok, but never as good as in the original.  Here the overall upbeat mood of the film seems to have gotten to her and she smiles her way through it Â– we barely see her trapped by the disfigured David who looks to her for support and her happy performance at the end totally changes the mood.  I love Jason Lee but he just seems out of place here but he is the only one of the leads who actually manages to convince when the mood goes from comedy to anger and resentment.  Kurt Russell is good but in the original the Doctor had a huge emotional punch at the end Â– here Russell doesn't do well with this scene and makes his role a damp squid.<br/><br/>I could go on for days, but overall the main problem with this is that Crow can't improve on the original.  All he can do is add material that pads out the story unnecessarily.  Vanilla Sky is American excess Â– a remake of a film that didn't need anything added to it. 4 out of 10."

","Vanilla Sky was on my list from a long time. So much of mixed reviews and feedback for this movie, intrigued and hieghtened my curiosity to watch it. Eventually took time out for it, and certainly glad about it.<br/><br/>Having watched Tom Cruise's quite a few movies, I felt this to be one of his best. Expressions and body language delivered more emotions than the dialogues. This is also true for other characters in the movie. Surely it comes out from an exceptional direction by Cameron Crowe.<br/><br/>The story line and pace is gluesome. Keeps you there in every scene, as it unfolds. The chemistry of the characters, evelotion of David till the last scene and great acting delivery by most, sums it up as a great watch.<br/><br/>To conclude, the movie doesn't get over in 136 minutes, but stays with you much beyond."

","When I first saw the previews for Vanilla Sky, I scared everyone around me with my jumping up and down that ""I've seen this movie before!!!""  Indeed, I had seen the original Spanish version on IFC, and was literally forced to watch the whole thing to the end to find out what really becomes of the main character.<br/><br/>To say I was rather p***ed someone tried to remake that movie was an understatement.  But I came expecting nothing - though I hoped this might be just as good, if not better.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, like most other 90-00s hollywood remakes, this film was rather hollow.  Sure, Cameron Crowe followed the original Abre Los Ojos exactly (rip-off might be more appropriate) - like the gutter shot, the nightclub, the post-birthday party experience (including the drawing and photos), the post-accident ""dream"" - but he added way to much meaning to the whole story.  Abre Los Ojos was just a psychological thriller, Vanilla Sky wants you to believe it will change you...<br/><br/>My suggestion?  Find Abre Los Ojos and watch that...preferably before you see Vanilla Sky - the plot will be more entertaining.  Besides, Tom Cruise isn't as much of a 'looker' as Eduardo Noriega."

I don't know what the hell else he could have been trying to do. It sure wasn't to make a believable, or even coherent film. The overly familiar Kurt Russell as an enigmatic psychiatrist?... pffft.

""What is happiness to you?"" is a line that is used multiple times in this movie. I really connected with the main character as he faced his demons and tried with all his heart to find happiness. Vanilla Sky is a love story but it is also a story of maturing and finding yourself.<br/><br/>The best friend of the hot guy who steals all the girls from him is played perfectly by Jason Lee. You can sense the admiration and resentment of David Ames all mixed in together. I've never thought much of Tom Cruise, Cameron Diaz or Penelope Cruz till I saw them in this. I figured Tom could only do action and that Diaz could only do comedy before I ran into Vanilla Sky.<br/><br/>There's a scene where Cameron Diaz says, ""I swallowed your cum - that means something!"" and the whole theater was in shock. We couldn't believe what we were hearing. The director mentions that his intention in that scene was to let us feel as though we were hearing a conversation and listening in on something that is normally private and that's exactly how I felt throughout a lot of the movie.<br/><br/>What is happiness to you?

I admit it may be sometimes hard to follow. But nevertheless, I never felt I couldn't catch up with the story or even lost motivation to watch it to the end.

It accompanies the film really, really well and the subtleties in the film are stunning. I had to watch Vanilla Sky about three times before I got every little bit of the film and this is why the film excels. Other performances by Timothy Spall and Kurt Russell back up the film splendidly and it annoys me when people say 'Abre los ojos' is much better, it's like when Nirvana 'fans' say ""Bleach is better than Nevermind"" just to seem like more of a hardcore fan. Vanilla Sky is better. It's thought provoking, romantic, funny and beautiful. I was thrilled to bit's with it and have now watched it about 150 times. I never get bored of it."

","""Vanilla Sky"" is one of those movies that can easily polarize audiences. It is easy to see how some think it is one of the best they've seen, and it is equally easy to see how some hate it. Other recent films like ""Magnolia"", ""Mulholland Drive"", ""Fight Club"", ""Memento"", and Donnie Darko"" have the same effect on viewers. Regardless of one's leanings, there is no question you have to watch this whole film intently, grasp every nuance, understand every conversation to be able to even discuss it intelligently. I like to view films like this, it is a good mental exercise that most films just don't provide.  On the opposite end of the spectrum is a film like ""Dumb and Dumber"", which happens to be one of my favorites, but one which you can watch very leisurely and just enjoy, like a good piece of creamy fudge!! :-)<br/><br/>CAUTION * SPOILERS follow, you may not want to read further if you have not yet seen ""Vanilla Sky"", which gets its title from a painting.<br/><br/>David (Tom Cruise) is a 30-something rich guy who seized 51% control of his corporation when both parents died in an accident, loves the ladies and shies away from commitment. During the film he is involved, apparently, with two women, a brunette (Penny Cruz) and a blonde (Cammy Diaz). He also has lucid dreams, sometimes starts having sex with one and finishes with the other. As he awakes his CD radio whispers ""wake up"", sometimes in the voice of one, sometimes the other. It gets to where we, the audience, as well as David, cannot tell which is dream and which is reality.<br/><br/>
Another layer in the story is the psychologist (Kurt Russell) visiting David in his jail cell, David with mask on, the psychologist trying to find out what really happened, was there really a murder. Is the psychologist real, or just part of the dream? We see a crash that apparently kills the blonde and disfigures David. We see him arguing with a panel of surgeons about doing something to stop the headaches.  We see him meet a stranger, we find out David had signed up for a ""Life Extension"" program where they freeze your body and bring back your mind into lucid dreams. The audience can tell by the vanilla-colored sky when David is supposed to be in these dreams.<br/><br/>At the climax, David is given a choice when he calls for ""tech support"". He has been dreaming lucidly for 150 years, he can continue or he can come out of that state and into reality. He has control, it will become what he imagines (shades of 'What Dreams May Come'), so he jumps off the tall building he is on, as he lands we only see one eye open, and hear ""wake up, David"" and the film ends.<br/><br/>I may watch it again before I return it to my library, but upon one viewing I find it impossible to precisely reconstruct a narrative. On the one hand, we could assume everything up to David waking up on the street, sleeping off a drinking binge, with the first ""vanilla sky"" we see, is real, and everything after is a lucid dream. Or, maybe everything between the first, early ""wake up"" and the last one, is a dream. Or some other combination. While I generally like for films to make sense, and feel that I am able to connect all the points, I don't feel that necessity here. The film was so very well done, just the entertainment of watching the story unfold and the pleasure of thinking about it afterward is worth it. <br/><br/>The DVD is fine, although unspectacular. The ""extras"" I didn't find particularly interesting, unless you really like to see Cameron Crowe and Tom Cruise ""behind the scenes"" and during the world premiere in Japan, with all the young Japanese girls acting like 1960 American teenagers seeing the Beetles for the first time.  <br/><br/>""Vanilla Sky"" - a thinking person's film."

","This was the worst movie I saw last year, and I saw some doozies (Corky Romano, Freddy Got Fingered...)  That acting, directing, editing, and soundtrack to this film are all horrible.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.<br/><br/>Let's start with the plot.  Normally, I enjoy somewhat confusing movies, whether they explain themselves in the end (Memento) or leave you wondering ""Huh?"" (Mulholland Falls).  But THIS movie just made me angry.<br/><br/>First of all, Tom Cruise's character was an arrogant, cocky, rich kid that the audience immediately disliked.  He used women, he never really worked all that hard, and everything in life had come easy for him.  For the first 15 minutes, Tom Cruise simply walks around and flashes his annoying smile.<br/><br/>
Then Penelope Cruz comes into the picture, and suddenly we're thrown into a confusing mess of a story.  Is Cameron Diaz really dead?  Is Penelope Cruz actually Cameron Diaz?  Did Tom Cruise kill somebody?  Did the Phantom of the Opera loan his mask to Tom Cruise?  Did Kurt Russell suddenly forget his daughter's names?   (If you think these questions are confusing, they're ACTUAL questions posed by the plotline....so if you think they sound dumb then you must agree to stay away from this film!)  The plot literally folds in on itself numerous times, but when it finally offers an answer to all the confusion, you just want to throw your popcorn at the screen and yell obscenities at the writers.  The ""explanation""--if you can call it that--is completely absurd.<br/><br/>Then we have the acting.  I've never been so annoyed with Tom Cruise before in my life.  He needs to stop playing over confident characters who are suddenly challenged a la Jerry McGuire, Maverick, etc....  After the accident that disfigures his face, Tom's acting takes a nosedive into bizarroland.  Wearing a latex mask, he stalks around nightclubs, muttering about regaining his life, blah blah blah....  He must have had his eyes wide shut when he received this script.  Then we have Penelope Cruz.... If she said ""Open your Eyes!"" one more time, I would have left the theatre.  Her character was a cardboard figure that you couldn't possibly understand, and it never seemed clear why Cruise was so madly in love with her character. She seemed strange and stale to me.  And Cameron ""do you believe in God"" Diaz....maybe it was just the writing, but her character was so filled with ""crazy girlfriend"" stereotypes--right down to the stalking scene at the party--that I cringed every time I saw her.<br/><br/>I could go on and on about the inappropriate soundtrack--why Radiohead and REM appear in a movie like this is beyond me--and they horrible editing (so quick and incomprehensible...Look!  There's Cameron Diaz's face saying Boo! There's Penelope Cruz in a wedding dress on the bed!  Did you miss that? Oh who cares!!!).  Bottom line--if this review made no sense to you, then you have a small perception of what the film's like.  Stay away from this movie!!!"

","Surprisingly one of my favorite movies of all time. If you enjoy surreal, offbeat films then Vanilla Sky is right up your alley. Vanilla Sky is a mind-bending excursion across genres - a warped fairy tale that dabbles in romance, mythology, horror, mystery, and science fiction. There are plenty of philosophical musings on the difference between dreams and reality, and numerous occasions in which the film dares us to tell them apart. Vanilla Sky gives new meaning to the familiar phrase from a children's song: ""Life is but a dream."" Tom Cruise brings movie star wattage and appeal and both the ladies Diaz and Cruz are bubby and good. Top notch directing the film. The pacing is excellent."

","I love the unique style and background Cameron Crowe brings to his films. It's like an unexpected mixture of juvenile wonder and adult innocence that appeals to me about his films. Vanilla Sky is by far his darkest feature, but also the one with the least amount of heart and pizazz. In fact, most of it is just a dull mess.<br/><br/>Vanilla Sky is an American remake of the 1997 Spanish film, Open Your Eyes. While I haven't seen that film yet, I can imagine it's probably a little more coherent. The remake poses some thought provoking questions and themes, including questions centered around life, death, dreams, guilt, regret, and a few other heavy hitters. But the way in which those themes are covered is less than impressive. It's a poor pun, but perhaps it isn't too surprising that this film feels very vanilla.<br/><br/>The performances were great all around, and became the main driving force for my dwindling interest as the film went along. You can see Tom Cruise's passion for this role dripping through the character of David. This may be the best Cameron Diaz has ever been, as the creepy but seductive Julie Gianni. And of course, Penelope Cruz is great as Sofia Serrano. As much as I love their performances, it's difficult to become invested in any of the relationships when the script isn't where it needs to be. It's a dull screenplay that feeds off your attention span, or lack thereof. By that I mean that the film is only as interesting as you make it out to be. It takes plenty of twists and turns to keep your interest enough, but what's the point of a twist if you don't really care where the characters end up?<br/><br/>Vanilla Sky is essentially a melodramatic soap opera disguised as a romantic mystery. I wasn't necessarily bored during the film, but it didn't grab my interest the way a film like this should have. Great acting, trippy visuals, and a classic Cameron Crowe soundtrack wasn't enough to save this dreamy picture.<br/><br/>+Acting<br/><br/>+Poses interesting questions<br/><br/>-But takes too many twists and turns for those questions to mean anything<br/><br/>-Dull script<br/><br/>5.6/10"

"Nachtportier","1","13","28","26 December 2005"," Mr. Cruise meets Spirituality
","The only two things I have heard about this movie in advance is that features lucid dreaming and that it's a remake from an European original. I haven't seen the original Spanish version yet, so I cannot compare these.<br/><br/>Beginning of the movie is very promising, since it opens with an stunning wake-dream sequence (Tom Cruise driving & running on completely empty Times Square!). The big problem dealing dreaming in the story is that the main character's dreams aren't conscious  he actually has a big problem with his dreaming and real life  he cannot separate the two. He doesn't know if he's dreaming  when he's dreaming  thus ignoring the basic premise of lucid dreaming  which actually means: being aware of yourself being in dreaming. So much for the lucid dreaming part  this one has to be dismissed  somebody didn't do the proper homework on that.<br/><br/>Second problem of the movie is the main character embodied in Mr. Cruise (who also co-produced the movie). His acting has never been more superficial, it gets painfully funny when he displays himself as rich, self-confident, prolific and sexual superhero without - even a slightest amount of irony. He plays this part so serious & intense that it gets absurd already at the very beginnings. Unintentional the viewer starts to ask himself: is this Mr. Cruise only playing himself  an superstar and fanatic Scientologist? Mr. Cruise is hanging so stiff on his performance and sticks unbelievably hard & intense on convincing the viewers of his superpowers that on the end very strong doubts come up: could be he's impotent in reality? Could be the rumors about his homosexuality are true? If you can deal with the above facts go for the plot. The story reveals itself in multiple layers. There is an indefinably amount of parallel time sequences. The audience actually never knows what is real or what is just been a dream  since our hero cannot distinguish his dreaming from real life (I hope this point is not 100% autobiographical, but who knows). The story somehow promises to reveal itself in the far future, but it just gets stacked over and over with new layers of questions and doubts. Usually there would be some suspense created upon this permanent pending state, yet Vanilla Sky just gets boring over time and manages to make you angry.<br/><br/>The largest psychological flaw is: our hero goes through some significant personal dramas (car accident, loss of a friend, loss of physical beauty, loss of personal integrity...etc.) yet Mr. Cruise' performance doesn't significantly change during that. There is no personal disintegration to feel  only to see. Actually the acting flaws terribly during the mask scenes (he wears a mask that covers his face) and especially during the disfigured face scenes (really heavy makeup), because Mr. Cruise acts angry and loud, just like he always does, when he's fit. A person going through all that drama would significantly change in their body language, but Mr. Cruise obviously cannot leave his body acting (habits).<br/><br/>There are two breaks in the rhythm which somehow dissolve the dense layers of reality/fiction/dreaming, these breaks annihilate the tension and kill the film. The first break are the shrink sequences (played by Mr. Kurt Russel, who looks completely out of place here), these scenes are ruined by Mr. Cruise' dull display of self-pity and heavily exaggerated body talk. Also Mr. Russel works mechanic, the only thing missing is seeing him peeking on his wrist watch and saying  okay, I'm finally done, now give me the check. The second much more significant break is both visual and conceptual  when the whole movie turns into something what looks like some sci-fi allegory  yet again it isn't allegoric, because it tries to explain the whole thing (the last 20 minutes). The movie is by far to long (140 min).<br/><br/>It's not a cheap movie. The soundtrack alone must have cost a fortune (Paul McCartney composed a theme). Speaking about music  the songs are good, but the way they are used are trying to cache either weak acting (P. Cruz) or bold performance (Mr. Cruise). It gets very schmaltzy & kitschy when those unequal two appear together in a love scene, even the best songs look cheap then, like mixed by an amateur filmmaker. There are some interesting special effects, but the best things are real (Times Square scene). The best performance in the long list of stars is surprisingly done by Cameron Diaz. At the beginning she acts shallow and arrogant  just like a mirror of Mr. Cruise, but later on she grows (over the level of this movie) and delivers remarkably stunning performance (the car scene).<br/><br/>If you take this movie serious you will probably be strongly disappointed, there are simply too many flaws. If you look at it as light entertainment, you will be frustrated even more  with only one exception: if you like open end movies that drive nowhere. Vanilly Sky won't dazzle your mind, it will only stress your patience & intelligence."

","It's a fact. The few ones that consider ""Vanilla Sky"" a good movie (or even great ¿?) have not seen the ""real"" movie, Spaniard ""Abre los ojos"" by Alejandro Amenábar.<br/><br/>It's common in the American film industry to see remakes of foreign films, due to the fact that usually, the traditional American film consumer will not watch a subtitled film. It happened with Amenábar's firs film ""Thesis"" with a very poor result. It is the same with Vanilla Sky.<br/><br/>First, the performers. We have a non convincing Tom Cruise, which has had much better roles in his career (just remember ""Magnolia"" and you'll understand what I'm talking about). Cameron Diaz -considered by many as a not serious actress- plays a whore, not the interesting, bitter character played by Najwa Rimji in ""Abre los ojos"". Penelope Cruz, doing the same role, fails to achieve the complex performance in the original film. Finally, while McCabe (Kurt Russell) is just ridiculous, Jason Lee does a decent job as Brian Shelby.<br/><br/>Second, Crowe proves everyone (and perhaps himself) that he's just a mediocre director: the story is too complex for his abilities. His script is just awful: it makes the story just stupid! In his next work, ""Elizabethtown"", he's just a decent director. But the bitter taste of this awful movie is still in me.

"TotenRot","3","9","18","20 December 2004"," A sixth emotion: Boredom
","At one point in this film the main character is told that there are five basic emotions: guilt, hate, shame, revenge and love. My immediate response was, what about anger and fear? I think this serves as a good illustration of this movie as a whole. It tries to appear intelligent, but it just isn't.<br/><br/>This movie asks some basic existential questions. For that purpose it tells a confusing story where the main character is led to question reality, his sanity, what's important in his life, friendship, love and all the usual clichés. And the answers are mostly the usual dogmas we all know by heart; Friendship and love is more important than money and good looks. D'oh!<br/><br/>This lightweight philosophical theme is set against a confusing story that doesn't have any real progress or goal. We just get to watch the main character get more and more confused, and his reality is failing more and more. Until the end, when we get the conclusion in a way that's just as imaginative as explaining all the unanswered questions of reality with something supernatural, such as God.<br/><br/>I suspect this movie will cater very well to intellectuals who love to analyze movies. There are plenty of metaphors here to dig into. The problem, however, is that they are not really interesting since the questions asked are, as stated earlier, mostly the usual clichés, and the answers are the usual dogmas. In my opinion this leaves no real reason to try to analyze this story, except for the mental exercise of analyzing and satisfying ones own intellectual ego through the process. That can of course be fruitful and interesting in itself. But it doesn't make an exciting movie.<br/><br/>To sum up, the problem with this movie is that the story is uninteresting and boring, and with an unimaginative conclusion. The questions raised are clichés, and the answers are dogmas. Good for those who like to analyze movies, boring for the rest of us. I give this film 3/10."

"karenlynn1","1","12","26","28 January 2006"," A horrible mess.
","This movie was a mess, from beginning to end. It seemed very ""thrown together"" and almost as if it was entirely ad libbed. <br/><br/>Tom Cruise plays David Aames; an egotistical, self-centered, rich pretty boy who thought he could do whatever he wanted and screw the consequences. In other words, he was playing himself. He finds out that treating women like yesterday's trash has consequences, when his ""bed buddy"" Julie(Cameron Diaz) starts to develop feelings for him and notices his attraction to another woman (Penelope Cruz). <br/><br/>There is a bad car accident. Julie dies. David gets messed up physically, IE ""pretty boy"" isn't so pretty anymore, and he cannot handle it. THe vain playboy takes a dozen or so pills because he cannot stand his own face. He especially cannot handle that his dream girl (also his best friend's dream girl) wants very little to do with him. <br/><br/>He became involved in this ""Lucid dream"" project (unsure whether it was before or after the accident, as the story jumps around so much time wise) and that is where the whole plot gets convoluted and twisted so that neither you nor the main character himself knows what is real and what isn't. <br/><br/>In David's dream-life, he's still handsome. And he has a wonderful romance with Sophia...or wait, Julie? Oh wait, nobody. He's dead? he's alive? He's seeing a shrink ( Kurt Russell). His shrink doesn't exist...? It all becomes a blur of scenes of David's fantasies and pseudo-realities, and neither the audience nor David knows what is real and what is just a dream. It's not even *really* explained by the end of the movie. <br/><br/>It would have been better if it were all wrapped up neatly in the end with an explanation of what is real and what isn't. But the end still kept us guessing. <br/><br/>It also would have been better if Cruise had not been cast in the leading role. His over-acting and yelling every line reaches an all-time high. And his attempts at a drunken stagger were pantomimic and laughable. Penelope Cruz was bland at best. And, in my opinion Cameron Diaz' performance really stands out as the multi-faceted Julie. Sadly, her scenes were short, sweet, and few.<br/><br/>I give this stinker a 2 out of ten."

","Pretentious, boring, lengthy, incomprehensible, Spanish: the bad words keep spilling out. Only the undetermined ""attractions"" of star Tom Cruise caused this dreadful picture to make the approximately $40m it is billed as having earned. Neither of the two competing horizontals, Penelope Cruise nor Cameron Diaz made any contribution. At least Ms. Cruz has breasts (we saw them), which Ms. Diaz did not (we did not see them). Ms. Diaz, driving to her death, had the line ""I swallowed your sperm"", which must have come directly from the Spanish script that inspired this still-born movie. I was barely able to keep awake for the whole of this head-banging experience and yearned to switch off: my partner somehow wanted to keep going, but couldn't explain why. I guess it's just wanting to see more of Tom Cruise's uncrushed and mashed facial features, which were restored several times during the incoherent script. Certainly the crash in which he got it wrecked was definitively final and should have killed the megastar and ended this picture. It would have been a favour to us all."
"buzzerbill","5","6","11","8 October 2008"," Not quite there........
","I am a big fan of Cameron Crowe. Liked ""Say Anything""; liked ""Jerry Maguire"" a lot; love ""Almost Famous"". I was really prepared to like ""Vanilla Sky"".<br/><br/>And what's not too like? Good performances all around, unsurprising from Kurt Russell and Penelope Cruz, but a little surprising from Tom Cruise and amazing from Cameron Diaz. I thought her métier was only comedy. I was wrong.<br/><br/>The film looks great.<br/><br/>Good special effects and sound.<br/><br/>So--what's the problem? Why only a 5? The first problem is that the film feels about 1/3 too long. After all, groping, even with pretty people like Cruise and Cruz and Diaz, is basically tedious. (I wonder when directors will learn that most sex scenes are in fact very boring. We've been (over)doing this since the 60s. Enough.) Nearly all scenes drag on too long. Of course, I believe that this might well be a strategy to give a dreamlike quality to the film. For this reviewer, it didn't work.<br/><br/>The second problem is that the dialogue (usually a strength in Crowe's films) sometime just rings false. Take Julie's dialogue just before she rams her car into a bridge to try and kill herself and David. To me, this ranting about ""Your body makes a promise"" and ""You were inside me four times"" (I will not quote the last line, since this is a family site) sounds like a ludicrous cross between Oprah, ""Desperate Housewives"" on a bad day, and a particularly inept porn movie.<br/><br/>The third, simply, is the structure of the plot. This is far from the first time we have seen this same plot; for instance, ""Jacob's Ladder"" (in my mind a very bad movie indeed) is nearly identical from a structural point of view. For a plot of this type to succeed, the writer needs to very carefully slip clues along the way so that the audience reaction to the final revelations is a mix of ""Cool!"" and ""Why didn't I see that coming?"" (Best example I know is ""Unbreakable"".) The fourth, I admit, may be idiosyncratic. Crowe's usual technique of weaving pop songs on the soundtrack just does not seem to jell with the material as well as it does in other films.<br/><br/>Net this all together and you have a film that feels too long, sometimes sounds silly, have a soundtrack that is not always well matched to the action, and where the structure and resolution of the plot don't work well. Do not get me wrong--I think the final sequence from the elevator to the end is far and away the best thing in the film.<br/><br/>A miss, a palpable miss. I wish that I could like it better--but I can't."

","There seem to be two main criticisms of this film. Either it is confusing and hard to follow, or it is a poor remake of the original. I found both of these claims to be nonsense, but at least I can understand the first. The key to our understanding does not show up until the very end, but given this key, the movie is perfectly consistent, and you may not notice the greatness of the film without a second or a third viewing.<br/><br/>As to the second claim, this film is superior to the original in every way I would care to compare them, and I can only chock up the opposite opinion to a common, and mostly justified, bias against any Hollywood film, especially one starring Tom Cruise. To this mindset, the film is doomed from the start, regardless of it's actual merits. I would normally share such opinions, but this film is something special. Tom Cruise is perfect in his role and as much as you might hate him personally as so many seem to do, he is very good, as is Penelope Cruz.<br/><br/>Just some advice to new viewers, have patience and trust that in the end all will be explained. The first 40 minutes can turn a lot of people off, but just wait. and for those who have watched the movie only once and found it wanting, try watching it again. You may be surprised. After my first viewing I thought it was just OK, but after several it has become one of my top 10 favorite films of all time. You might want to give it another chance as well."

It's one of his best performances. Penaolope Cruz, Kurt Russell (he's always great), Jason Lee (he's always great too), Cameron Diaz, Noah Taylor, Timothy Spall, and Tilda Swinton (in a brief but good role). Another thing is the beautiful Cinematography by the great John Toll (who also did Almost Famous, Legends of the Fall, Braveheart, The Thin Red Line, The Last Samurai etc.) with the ""Monet-like skies"" and so on he presents a visually stunning experience that is both viscerally and cerebrally affecting. And of course the music. Radiohead, Nancy Wilson, Red House Painters, R.E.M., The Chemical Brothers, Peter Gabriel, Paul McCartney, Jeff Buckley, The Beach Boys, Bob Dylan, U2, Leftfield, Spiritualized, The Rolling Stones, Todd Rundgren, Sigur Ros, just...wow. Highlights for me are the opening (Everything In Its Right Place), when Dvaid and Sofia say goodbye sort of for the last time (Last Goodbye), when David is running for Sofia before the splice (Sweetness Follows), And the last 15 minutes. The Elevator scene (Elevator Beat and Ladies and Gentlemen, We Are Floating in Space). And of course the roof scene. The Nothing Song (Njosnavelin) What an achingly beautiful song.

","After the first hour or so of this movie I was thinking ""this is truly bizarre."" I was finding it very difficult to follow and in all honesty not particularly interesting. But it does get better as it moves along, and by the end of the movie it had actually turned into a decent sci-fi adventure whose ending I was really very interested in.<br/><br/>The story, as I suggest, is a bit confusing in the first hour or so and it takes some real commitment to stick with it, but it's helped along by better than average performances from the main leads - Tom Cruise, Cameron Diaz and Penelope Cruz. The love triangle that's represented by the three is a bit of a mystery, particularly the nature of the relationship between Cruise and Diaz, and how that relationship ends is quite shocking and was the point at which I really started to sit up and pay close attention. From there on it's interesting to watch as Cruise tries to sort out fantasy from reality and comes to terms with his ultimate fate and the decision it leaves him with.<br/><br/>Overall this is a better than average movie; a bit long perhaps, but worth the time to watch.<br/><br/>6/10"
"dfranzen70","3","6","12","3 June 2002"," Never bland, but never terribly interesting (or comprehensible)
","In an era of big-budget, super-duper special effects movies, a lot of people pine for the old days when plot meant something and characterization was key. Well, look what we get. A convoluted, disinterested absurd piece of pablum that's not worth the celluloid on which it was filmed.<br/><br/>Vanilla Sky is about a dashing young publisher named David Aames (Tom Cruise) who has two women in his life - his ""buddy"" Julie (Cameron Diaz) and mysterious new woman Sofia (Penelope Cruz), who just happens to be his best friend's girlfriend. David feels he's being stalked by Julie, who wants more than sex, but he can't keep his eyes and hands off Sofia. You can see this is just heading for trouble.<br/><br/>Much of the plot centers around a violent car crash in which David emerges with a disfigured face. What happens after that is quite surreal - kind of like floating in a dream in which at once everything and nothing seems to have meaning. Under such circumstances, one can twist logic and reality into whatever one desires (in this case, ""one"" would be the screenwriter). Anything can happen and be justified. That's great, but it doesn't always make for a good movie, just as free association doesn't make for a good novel.<br/><br/>To begin with, Cruise himself seems miscast, although ironically so. He's the kind of movie actor who much of the world sees as the cocky, arrogant, preening archetype of male stars, always worried about how they look. And yet here he is with a horribly ugly face - is he trying to tell the world, ""Look, I can play creepy-looking, too!"" No, Tom, you can't.<br/><br/>And for at least the third movie, I hear Cruise utter these words, or a variation: ""I've been set up!"" He sure gets set up a lot - see The Firm, this one, and the upcoming Minority Report, to name three. What it all goes back to is his characters' inability to believe they themselves have done anything wrong, ever.<br/><br/>Secondly, there's a huge lack of chemistry between any of the three leads, especially between Cruise and Cruz. I'm sure there are legions of people who believe Penelope Cruz is the cat's pajamas, but don't count me among them. I didn't find her particularly attractive or alluring in the movie. I won't waste space picking apart her obvious physical issues, but please - let's not place her on some goddess pedestal. But for a couple that apparently fell for each other off the set, Cruise and Cruz don't seem particularly enamored of each other on it. Yes, they make goo-goo eyes to each other. Snoresville.<br/><br/>And that plot! It's one thing to have twists and turns, each leading to more questions and mysteries, and it's quite another to have each twist cancel out the last twist. The movie kept negating itself. I know it was trying to show that the line between dreams and reality can be seriously blurred, but you can't have each scene render the last one irrelevant. Instead of being clever, all this does is confuse and frustrate the viewer.<br/><br/>About the only real spark of life comes from David's best friend Brian, played by Jason Lee. And you know, when Jason Lee's the only one making things happen, you know you got yourself a crappy movie. There are supposed heavyweights in this movie - Cruise, Diaz - and your best performance is by Jason Lee of Mallrats and Almost Famous (another Cameron Crowe movie, like this flop)? Geez!<br/><br/>I'm glad I didn't see this in the theater, although I might not have been so critical if I had (you know, it's the classic ""I spent $8 on this, so I'm gonna like it!"" rhetoric). I don't think Cruise's career is in any kind of jeopardy, as evidenced by his usual $20 million paycheck. He might want to develop an additional facial expression or two, however.<br/><br/>This is a bizarre, pointless movie that seems to take delight in its tortured script, wallowing in its own nonsense."

","""Vanilla Sky"" is about a drug. It's a familiar drug that every man tries once in his life, whether consciously or not. In the film, that drug is Sofia (Penelope Cruz). She embodies love—that intoxicating drug that gives David (Tom Cruise) a high that permanently shifts his normal. In other words, his mood will never be the same again without it.<br/><br/>David, a guy so perfect that a single gray hair is unacceptable, is seemingly forced towards humility after suffering a disfiguring accident shortly after meeting Sofia. However, it is not humility he achieves, but a curse that transcends any kind of physical deformity. David has to have that drug again, so he desperately seeks out his previous normal state, taking drastic measures to make it a reality.<br/><br/>Both Cruise and Cruz play idealized characters. Cruise plays a meticulously perfect big shot, who is only likable because of his abundance of confidence and charm. Meanwhile, Cruz is the natural kind of perfect, and is as desirable as she is pure (she met his friend at a library!). It is no surprise that they were a pair in real life because their puppy love is authentic and palpable (an emotional stage on par with ""A Lot Like Love"" and ""Like Crazy""). I could not help but smile. And Cameron Diaz is utterly frightening as the irrationally clingy stalker—every man's worst nightmare.<br/><br/>The film just exudes replay value. It is a cerebral ride along the lines of ""The Butterfly Effect"", ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"", ""Source Code"", and ""The Fountain""—all loose-reality based films where a man obsesses over a woman.<br/><br/>Vanilla Sky is pure ecstasy and an enthralling cinematic escape.

As for Penelope Cruz, I will only ask, what is the big deal.<br/><br/>I thought I was going to be watching a compelling murder mystery.  Turns out that wasn't really the case. The way the true plot is introduced, very late into the film (like the end), I felt like it was the kitchen sink being thrown in.  That is one objection I have.  The other objection I have is, though the film only ran about two hours, it moved very slowly and seemed MUCH longer.  Whenever that's the case, you know there's a problem.  Fifteen minutes at the beginning could easily have been cut and we would have gotten the point of the main character's life and lifestyle, and the pivotal scene of the film would have been moved back considerably.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, if you're up for seeing something that will spark discussion, intrigue you and has depth to it, this is a good one to see.

","""The little things. There's nothing bigger, is there?"" ~ Tom Cruise, Vanilla Sky In 2001 Cameron Crowe created an incredible film. Now why it is that some movies resonate with us and others fail to connect, I am not sure. In part, the masterpieces simply have no hollow notes. The director somehow brings out stellar performances from his cast and makes no compromises along the way. It helps, of course, to have a magical script, and the film Vanilla Sky explodes with layers of meaning that go deep to make it a very special film.<br/><br/>I can think of two reasons this film has been panned by a segment of the public. One is that Tom Cruise is the star, and for this reason alone it might be dismissed by some. This is an incredible performance, however, and can't be so easily dismissed. A second reason is that the film is a remake in English of a Spanish version of the same story, starring the same Penelope Cruz. Who cares? I did not see the Spanish version. I saw this one.<br/><br/>The film is complicated, and requires a measure of work on the part of the viewer. If you have to see it twice to see that the continuity is there, maybe that is OK. The film hangs together and is not a manipulation with a twist ending. Yes, the ending twists, but is a logical extension of the story.<br/><br/>For me, the scene in the middle where Tom Cruise is dancing with the mask on the back of his head is so fabulously conceived for its symbolic value, for Cruise become Janus, the Roman mythological figure with two faces. Janus was the god of gates or doors, doorways, beginnings and endings. In this film, though we know it no, the scene telegraphs the pivotal transition for David Aames, who has been tragically disfigured as a result of his own choices. Sometimes, you can learn from the past but can't change it.<br/><br/>I am not certain what it is that so resonates with me about this film. In part, it may be the philosophical questions it raises about who we are, and the life we would live if we could truly live our dreams. Or maybe, it is simply the identification with the profoundly tragic thing that happened to this man, the pain he inflicted on his friends, the grief he  and they -- must have experienced.<br/><br/>It is interesting, too, that the Cruz character is named Sofia, the Greek word for wisdom. The symbols, the erudite references throughout, the layers of complexity may be simply too much for a typical audience given to pop entertainment values. Or maybe I am too sentimental to be properly critical, since at least one poll rated this one of the worst films of all time.<br/><br/>The film is atypical in structure, and a bit labyrinthine as one circles through the maze of story lines. But it is not utterly inaccessible. One can ""get it"" because there is something to get. It is not simply a manipulation.<br/><br/>Much more could be said than this, but others have said it already, so I simply close with this. For me, the wonder of the film is summed up in three words: Open Your Eyes."

","I wanted to watch a movie that was very deep, abstract, existential, and philosophical but I couldn't find any other movies that fits into my category other than Fight Club. But when I heard that Vanilla Sky has a lot of philosophical themes I was curious enough to watch it. I burrowed this movie from block buster and saw it and I have to say that I really liked the movie. I didn't exactly understand why there were a lot of negative reviews because I thought vanilla sky was 10 times better than any average Hollywood movies. However I understand that people are not very favorable of movies without a solid conclusion, but in favor of the movie I argue that most movies these days have solid conclusions and majority of those conclusions are very unoriginal, corny, and extremely ... ""Hollywood"". Vanilla Sky ends in a way that makes the audience guess or think what the main character chose: A real life or a life of dreams. Most movie-watchers have the tendency to watch movies that requires no philosophical inquiry and would rather watch movies that are usually simple and predictable. What I'm exactly arguing for is that Vanilla Sky is one of those few movies that are actually different in a positive sense. If one simply looks at the plot of Vanilla Sky then you can't exactly appreciate it because you're excluding the idea or the theme. The theme is hard to describe because unlike most movies it's not very tangible; It's hard to grasp it all at once, you actually have to see the movie to understand what I mean. Well I explained why I found the movie significant to me, but I'll also explain why I didn't give a perfect rating. For me personally the twist in the movie didn't seem entirely realistic, it was rather some-what out of place. However the twist was necessary to convey the theme but such ""necessary evil"" has partially ruined the movie. This is probably why most reviewers disliked it, which I could understand, but as I said before the twist seemed necessary to convey the theme. A similar movie called Forgotten was even worse, the way the twist worked made it worse than the plot-twist in vanilla sky. In Vanilla sky they had a plot-twist that seemed more possible, in Forgotten the twist is a mixture of possibility and impossibility. The twist was more like one of those UFO conspiracy theories you hear now and then, which I found to be very corny. So basically yes you'll find a ridiculous plot twist in Vanilla Sky but it isn't as bad as the plot twist in other movies, Vanilla Sky uses a plot twist that is necessary to convey it's theme and I don't know any other better ways to convey the theme. It's not the best way, I admit, but what counts is that it works. Well In conclusion I have to say that I enjoyed Vanilla Sky and I enjoyed the humor and romance."
"eht5y","Null","5","10","9 August 2004"," A Misstep for Crowe and Cruise
","Tom Cruise is a movie star, not an actor. Which is sort of a shame for him, because part of what makes Tom Cruise so likable and successful is the fact that he tries so hard: from his earliest scene-stealing efforts in 'The Outsiders' and 'Taps' to 2004's 'Collateral,' Cruise has never stopped working to prove himself. There's no other explanation for how a vertically challenged, horse-toothed kid with a hawk's beak and a nasally voice to match could redefine star quality and become one of the biggest box office draws in movie history.<br/><br/>But let's face it: this guy is no Olivier. More often than not, he has played the same role in barely altered incarnations (ex: in 'Top Gun,' he's a cocky, reckless Navy pilot with an Oedipal hang-up facing down his fears; in 'A Few Good Men' he's a cocky, reckless Navy JAG lawyer with an Oedipal hangup . . . etc.). Even in his better performances, he badly overacts, specializing in stagey emotional displays that tend toward unintentional comedy. Cruise can be a commanding presence when the director in charge knows how to exploit him appropriately, as did Oliver Stone in 'Born on the Fourth of July' and P.T. Anderson in 'Magnolia,' where the character either matched Cruise's persona--Ron Kovic, the Vietnam vet Cruise plays in 'Born on the Fourth of July,' is, like Cruise, a small, scrappy, intense, highly emotional overachiever--or was designed with Cruise in mind, as is the case with most of his post-'Top Gun' ouevre, including his role as Frank T.J. Mackey in 'Magnolia'. In both of those roles, Cruise emotes shamelessly--shaking bouts of grief-stricken weeping mar both performances--and yet you still like him, and you're still rooting for him, which is what makes him a movie star. But for the very same reason, you NEVER FORGET that he's a movie star--that is, audiences are always aware that they're watching Tom Cruise, super-celebrity. Suspension of disbelief when watching a Tom Cruise film is impossible. It probably wouldn't be any easier even if he were as good an actor as he desperately wants to be. Unfortunately, he's not. <br/><br/>This is glaringly obvious in 'Vanilla Sky,' which has Cruise playing an utterly despicable character with the depth of a backyard birdbath. David Aames lives in an adolescent wish-fulfillment fantasy: heir to a magazine publishing fortune, he still rides a skateboard at thirty-three, spends most of his time clubbing, shopping, toning his rock-hard abs with his sycophantish starving-artist pal Brian (Jason Lee), or laying one of the scores of beautiful babes who are suckers for his wealth and cocksure good looks. David's arrogance and self-absorption are obviously setting him up for a fall, which I won't disclose here other than to say that one should never get in a car being driven by an obviously emotionally unstable woman you've been using for sex. But after said fall, David does not work through his folly to become a likable guy, but, rather, remains a narcissistic jerk desperate to reclaim the easy, comfortable, pleasure-seeking life he once enjoyed. <br/><br/>One can't really comment on the intricacies of the plot without giving the whole thing away, so I'll simply say that it was better the first time, in Alejandro Amenabar's 'Abre Los Ojos', the original version of the story from which Cameron Crowe adapted 'Vanilla Sky.' What I can say without spoiling is that a film such as this stands or falls on the audience's ability to sympathize with the main character, which is virtually impossible here. <br/><br/>Despite the implications of this review, I really like Tom Cruise--I even enjoyed 'The Last Samurai,' the latest in the line of self-produced (with partner and agent Donna Wagner) star vehicles in which Cruise plays the macho-but-stoically sensitive stock-character that made him famous. But 'Vanilla Sky' was a misstep, both for Cruise and for director Cameron Crowe, who, despite his skill, is incapable of making the audience care what happens to a jerk like David Aames.<br/><br/>The most frustrating aspect of 'Vanilla Sky' is that it is a visually arresting film with a superb cast (Lee, best-known for his turn as the cynical, acerbic Banky in 'Chasing Amy,' is excellent as always, as are Cameron Diaz, Penelope Cruz, Noah Taylor, Kurt Russell, Tilda Swinton, and Timothy Spall). A scene in which David finds himself in a deserted Times Square (not a digital mock-up or soundstage; it's the real thing) is itself worth the price of admission. But the film as a whole is inscrutable, and Cruise is unable to inject Aames with enough complexity or even a shred of likability to compensate for the meanderings of the plot and the essential loathsomeness of his character."

","Vanilla Sky was a really great film! I was not reall surprised because I was at least expecting it to be decent, but it went way beyond my initial expectations which were wavering due to the moderate press it has been getting in the shadow of all of this ""Lord of the Rings"" hype, of which it has absolutely no similiarity. This film works in many ways, but more shocking than anything is the way it works in a way where films of its type have attempted in the past, but nothing as surreal but decipherable as Crowe's enterpettion. There are some extremely emotionally unsettling moments in this film, I actually found myself looking away because of how effective its platform and performances were. You need to see this movie. But go with an open mind, people were walking out like idiots saying they couldn't ""get"" it. Give me a break, people! You can't be that far gone ito stupidity.. can you? FIVE STARS."

","I got my copy of vanilla sky in China were it was sold for a rather pricey 40 English pence. Not sure of the quality of either the physical product or the movie I did not set myself up in the usual relaxed and open fashion to take on the film. Open your eyes, the film Vanilla Sky was based of can compare with VS as a more reserved and classical type of a film with some grandeur thrown in to arouse the senses. But I don't want to compare as to what is better for doing that would immediately take the films out of context, especially when I think VS deserves undivided attention and several playthroughs. Now I'll tell you why.<br/><br/>VS starts by taking on a more structured and visceral tone. Sound acting and the elevated emotions within characters go far to tell the story effectively. The use of NY City displayed in a modern showcase I think gives the watcher a better understanding of what is going in and the approaches used. I don't want to spoil much but I will just a little. A good looking wealthy man (Cruise) who lives a young and somewhat careless life is someone's car when they decide to drive of a bridge and kill themselves in the process. Cruise survives but his face ends up scarred and disfigured.<br/><br/>The story is of how his life is changed is what VS is about, or is it how change was halted? That's one question to ask as you play through. With the crash he looses things that he had taken for granted before and we are asked the question of what substance fills the emotions of life and the connection between them. ""You have to have some sour to appreciate the sweet"". Lines like this describe the honeycombed life that he led and how his social aspirations were what he lived off, something he can now not achieve like he used to.<br/><br/>There are more things to consider too. One is realisation not just of your own emotions, but those of others. The difference between reality and lucidity. The creations within our own mind. Some may watch the film and think some of the characters are shallow and formulaic, but in these cases that is precisely what they are meant to be.<br/><br/>In terms of emotion VS strikes many cords. There is an odd psychedelic tone mixed with Romance, discovery and wondering and sometimes shock, horror. There are shots in the film that make your heart take a leap and it takes you off your guard enough so that if you study your emotions afterwards you will see what you would be like in Cruise's place.<br/><br/>Technically speaking, the direction is sound and the music gives an artistic quality mixed with new tones that represent the science fiction based twist the movie possesses. Some shots are the most profound you will see in many films to come. VS is a film that is impossible to categorize and has a story that could lead several ways depending on your perception and choice to accept facts against fiction. There is a huge amount to look out for in the details that help discover the story more effectively or push the possibility towards you that the entire film is softly leading you astray. It's hard to know for sure. So watch it a few times, and each time you do, choose a different path, and different side, and see what new things you find."

","This has got to be one of the most underrated films ever. It is an absolutely brilliant movie. It makes you think from beginning to end, the cinematography is amazing, the Directing and Editing are outstanding and it is very entertaining. The soundtrack to this movie is also excellent, as is the acting. There are very little flaws to this movie - it easily deserves to be on the top 250, especially when something like Grindhouse manages to be voted in the top 100 films of all time...what a terrible shame. Vanilla sky is very clever, it is NOT too absurd; it completely makes sense once you understand it. The only reasons people may hate this film is because 1) They don't understand the plot. 2) They just don't like Tom Cruise (or his character) 3) They are an ignoramus. I beg of anybody that is prejudice against this movie to give it a second chance and at least appreciate how well made it is.

","Wow, I really didn't think that Tom Cruise was actually capable of carrying a heartfelt movie. My opinion is that this is the best movie Tom Cruise has made so far. <br/><br/>I actually only decided to watch this because I'm a car guy, and I knew that this movie had a Ferrari 250 GTO in it (turns out it's a replica). Interestingly, there were also quite a few other nice classic cars in the movie, such as a 1960s fastback Mustang and a Volvo 1800ES shooting-brake. <br/><br/>It's a well-written and complex story that comes together at the end, but I don't want to give anything away, so I'm going to stop there. Normally, Cruise is a charismatic and energetic ""Movie Star,"" but not a particularly compelling or convincing actor, and until the end this formula was holding true, but then, for lack of a better word, the film blossoms. <br/><br/>The way I would categorize this movie is that the French should have made it, but until they do, the American original will do nicely."

","I saw this movie when it first came out in theaters, I had just lost someone in my life and let's say I saw this movie a few times. Over the years I kept on coming back to this IMDb page to read people's reviews on this movie, the score started as low as 4.9 and came all the way up 6.8, i think once the blu ray comes out, in a few years it will go up some more. I have seen the original movie, and i have to say the low budget intrigue & minimalistic approach makes it a better film. Cameron Crowe put a killer mix tape over this and added some production value and it went from a sci fi indie to a melodrama. people savor it because they can relate to it, the bits and pieces of music and short quotes, like ""consequences"", ""every passing minute"", ""when we are both cats"", it's an effective movie because like Eternal Sunshine, this movie teases your emotions. so 6.8 really tells me a lot of more people are still out there with pain buried in their hearts, and that they have to live their lives with regret, and when they see this movie, their minds wonder about what could have happened."
"tomsview","8","3","5","24 September 2013"," Dreamscape Cruise
","""Vanilla Sky"" is a journey into David Lynch territory without David Lynch. The plot for this film is unusual and boundary stretching, and contains more layers than Earth's geological record.<br/><br/>The film begins with what could be a series of dreams and then develops into a series of flashbacks and flash forwards. Right from the opening scene, the audience knows the journey will not be an easy one.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise's character, David Aames, awakes from a dream, or does he? Open your eyes is the command from his alarm clock and is a recurring theme throughout the movie as well as being the English translation of the title of the original Spanish film, ""Abre Los Ojos"". <br/><br/>David is the heir to his father's publishing empire. He seems to lead a life of privilege and wealth despite pressure from the board of directors. David's love life is also privileged; he is having an affair with Julie Gianni played by Cameron Diaz, a beautiful model who seems carefree and independent. <br/><br/>Although it does not detract too much from the story, David's role as publisher of three major magazines is rather superficially conceived – a Hollywood stereotype of the publishing world; not much more realistic than the ""Quality"" magazine office in 1957's ""Funny Face"".<br/><br/>When David meets Sophia (Penelope Cruz repeating her role from ""Abre Los Ojos""), he becomes infatuated. Another odd touch is the way Sophia and David draw so well, they produce portraits of each other that would have done Norman Rockwell proud, but there is no explanation for their talents. <br/><br/>David's affair with Sophia triggers a murderous obsession in Julie who tries to kill David and herself in a car smash. David survives but is disfigured, and his life is dramatically changed. <br/><br/>The film takes a leap forward in time to David's challenged future. David is in a mental institution awaiting charges of murder. He wears a full-face mask, which must be said, does not aid audibility. A psychiatrist, Dr. Curtis McCabe (Kurt Russell), attempts to unravel David's problems.<br/><br/>Nearly all the leads play against type. Especially Kurt Russell who brings a great sense of integrity to his role as a psychiatrist. Cameron Diaz also gives her role depth.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise plays privileged and spoilt perfectly. During the course of the film his character is assailed with facial disfigurement and a limp. These are the kind of characteristics that can lead to acting with a capital A. From ""Richard III"" to the ""Hunchback of Notre Dame""; actors find it hard to restrain themselves when the heavy make-up is applied and the foot is dragged. Fortunately, Tom only succumbs occasionally to the overwhelming theatrics of it all.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it is the movie that cannot stay the course – before the end, ""Vanilla Sky"" blinks.<br/><br/>Unlike ""Mulholland Dr"" where very little is explained, ""Vanilla Sky"" introduces a character, Edmund Ventura (Noah Taylor), to explain things. The explanation is a get-out-of-jail-card. Taylor's character provides a reason for what has occurred – to a point. It is not a totally satisfying resolution. <br/><br/>Although the denouement is unexpected and left field, those who hung in there could have expected an ending more in keeping with the human drama that had gripped their imaginations up until this point. The truth is that the script for ""Vanilla Sky"" painted itself into a corner and cheated a little to get out.<br/><br/>Despite this, ""Vanilla Sky"" remains a complex, intriguing story that breaks away from easy formulas. It really does deliver something different."

","I saw the movie first time six years ago and I still get puzzled over details in it. Like the way Sofias character gets less ""surprising"" when David starts dreaming. He can't imagine her as she was. When they first meet she is really funny and they joke together. But he isn't able to come up with jokes alone so he imagines her speaking Spanish..Once she is joking like the real Sofia, when she takes of the bandage and says that the ears are in the right place :) One thing about the movie bothers me though, in the end the tech support told David about the wake and about everyone showing up and about Sofia missing him the most.. OK, very possible. But how could the people on LE know that? Where they also at the wake? Did they talk to Brian or Sofia? Is it company policy to follow up what happens after their customers ""die""...? Or was it just a story the tech support told David to make him feel better (or David sort of telling himself since we're ""inside his head"") Or is it a slip by the movie makers.."

","Director Cameron Crowe strikes gold with an intelligent, erotic and frustrating romantic drama. This is one of those love or hate movies. I absolutely love it. Tom Cruise plays David Aames, a multi-millionaire that seems to have the whole world by the tail. Inheriting leadership of a multi-faceted publishing business at such a young age has not endeared him with the seven member board of directors. His womanizing is legendary and subject to much speculation. He is stalked by an obsessive lover(Cameron Diaz)and his life soon becomes very scrambled when he meets an attractive Penelope Cruz at his birthday party. The Diaz character gets fed up with competing for lover boy's affection and decides to commit suicide by driving off of a bridge with him in the car. Aames is left disfigured and charged with murder.<br/><br/>Whirlwind flashback sequences accompanied with a tremendous soundtrack pace this mind wrecking, nerve snarling, and confusing, but interesting piece of storytelling. Cruise is totally in control of his talents. This is one of his best performances. Miss Cruz is adequate and highly overrated. The perky, gorgeous Diaz is sexy and haunting. Kurt Russell is compassionate and strong as Dr. McCabe. Jason Lee is underrated and deserves kudos for his part as the best friend of the egotistical lead character that seems to always be there to be s**it on and humiliated.<br/><br/>The star studded soundtrack features music by R.E.M., Peter Gabriel, Jeff Buckley, Nancy Wilson, Bob Dylan and the haunting movie theme song ""Vanilla Sky"" by Sir Paul McCartney. This project also features the singing debut of Miss Diaz singing ""I Fall Apart"" written by Cameron Crowe and Nancy Wilson.<br/><br/>Like this one or not; understand this one or not...this movie will give you something to contemplate and more than enough to talk about."

If a film can do this then you know it's a keeper.<br/><br/>Not being a Tom cruise fan myself automatically makes me sceptical about films with him starring; however this film suits his acting style perfectly. In other words you love to hate him. The plot is clever and well thought out. You do have to pay attention through the film to make sure you stay on track. The love story is good and not over the top, and you feel real emotion throughout the film. Cameron Diaz also fits her character well and it's nice to see her play a straight role rather than a comedy. There are some high powered emotional scenes with language that will shock you but also draw you in.<br/><br/>One of the reasons I love this film is the soundtrack. The music in any film can literally make or break it for me. This film has one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard. The music fills you with emotion and I found myself buying many of the tracks from the film after I watched it.<br/><br/>The ending really shows how clever it is, leaving you with a satisfied warm feeling inside.

"VirginiaBeld","8","4","8","16 July 2007"," Sweet and Sour Cinema: Cameron Crowe's Vanilla Sky
","The film Vanilla Sky was adapted for American audiences from a Spanish foreign film called Abre Los Ojos meaning open your eyes. Cameron Crowe writes the screenplay and directs this americanized version. Vanilla Sky provides an A-list cast including Tom Cruise, Penelope Cruz,Cameron Diaz, Jason Lee, and Kurt Russell. The movie details a series of very strange events in the life of thirty-something, spoiled publishing tycoon David Aames, played by Tom Cruise. Brian Shelby,played by actor Jason Lee, is his best friend and a source of reason and wisdom for David. Juliana Gianni, played by Cameron Diaz, becomes very jealous and possessive of David after he blows off their casual sexual relationship to pursue the romantic affections of Sophia Serrano, played by actress Penelope Cruz. Through these events David Aames begins to realize that something is wrong with the world and finds out he is only too right but in a way so strange and surprising that it challenges the imagination. Cameron Crowe makes excellent use of dialog, symbolism, and structure to support the film's key concepts and themes. He also makes use of them by hiding clues to the overall mystery throughout the film in the dialog and in visual symbolism. Crowe presents many valid points through the themes and concepts concerning the importance of dreams, desires, and the human mind.<br/><br/>The use of dialog and symbolism to reveal subtle clues to the viewer can be found throughout Vanilla Sky. Throughout the entire film people keep telling David to wake up or open his eyes, inferring the he is sleeping or not really awake. Aames refers to his company's board members as the seven dwarfs which would make him Snow White who fell into a deep sleep after eating a poison apple in the children's story Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. This becomes more relevant later when it is revealed that David overdoses on his medications in order to end his real life so that he may begin his lucid dream in cryo-stasis. In one scene Sophia asks David if this is all a dream and he replies absolutely though they mean in reference to the state of post-relations bliss they are both enjoying at the time. The psychologist character, played by Kurt Russell, asks David during his interview if he knows the difference between dreams and reality. Several clues lie hidden within the visuals of the film and are symbols of their hidden meanings. The Monet painting in Aames' apartment is called Vanilla Sky, and after the night David passes out in the street the real sky itself becomes like that of the painting signifying where the lucid dream begins. Many times in the film Life Exstension, cryogenics, and a thawed out dog named Benny are either discussed directly by the characters or by others on televisions being watched by the characters, this is David's sub-conscious piecing together memories supposedly erased by the Life Exstension process. In this way Crowe shows how David's memories of his former real life begin to bleed through becoming mixed with those created solely within the lucid dream. Crowe uses these devices to give the viewer subliminal glimpses of the true nature of the plot.<br/><br/>There are many themes and key concepts in regard to life, dreams, and the human mind in this film. Two of the more prominent re-occurring lines in Vanilla Sky are ""the sweet is never as sweet without the sour"" and ""every minute that passes is a chance to turn it all around"". The first phrase is a piece of sage advice given to David by his friend Brian on several different occasions. The writer may be making an assertion to life in general, but also regarding the relationship between the waking world and that of dreams. Perhaps Crowe wishes to express that dreams are a form of escapism for us from the harsh real world. The second phrase is repeated throughout the film to David by several people. It can also be seen as a generic statement about life and taking advantage of second chances, but more specifically it is advice given to David when he begins to despair or become afraid of the chaos, confusion, and insanity he is experiencing. This is meant as a trigger to remind his sub-conscious that he can call for help from tech support at any moment. The phrase in the dialog, ""the sub-conscious is a powerful thing"", can be considered the central concept for the film as a whole. Within the film it answers the how question of what is really happening to David Aames. Externally the film uses similar techniques, playing on the sub-conscious of the viewer by subtly manipulating the style and structure in coherence with the themes of the story.<br/><br/>Cameron Crowe takes advantage of his role as the director and screenplay adapter by incorporating into the film's style and structure key elements to the conceptual nature of the film itself. The film's style was somewhat surreal with the colors being more vibrant after the lucid dream splice had taken place. The structure and flow of the film is helpful in projecting the feeling of dreams. Much like a lot of real dreams the story jumps around within the plot's time line but keeps an overall forward motion. Also, like in dreams, there are instances of lines that do not fit or make sense in the context that they are spoken. Many of these random lines are meant to be clues, such as ""this is a revolution of the mind"", spoken randomly to David by a man he passes by in the hall of the police station. This is reminiscent of how dialog in dreams doesn't always make sense in the context of the dreams themselves. Crowe uses these types of techniques to make the movie experience that much more psychologically interactive for the viewer; to truly transport them into the world of Vanilla Sky, a world of dreams."

","Vanilla Sky is one of my all time favourites for a lot of reasons. After watching it first, it tingled up my spine for a long-long time. I was really deeply affected by it, and the rest of my day was totally different from normal. I had seen such a thing about evaluation of life I have never seen before.<br/><br/>The story is really quirky, keeps your mind moving from the first minute to the last one. Apparently, it is found by some of the people, who have seen this film, freak as they had been expecting something utterly different. Personally, I got the point and I am really happy with it. There are some quotes I am really keen on, like ""The sweet is never really sweet without a sour."", or ""Every passing minute is another chance to turn it all around"". Besides, I love the sound editing which conveyed supremely the melancholic atmosphere and ambivalent ardour of Vanilla Sky.<br/><br/>After all, without a fine directing (which is not flawless though!) and a superb acting it all would not have been so fantastic. Tom Cruise proved he is not lost, he did a great job just like in Jerry Maguire which is directed by Cameron Crowe as well as Vanilla Sky. Cameron Diaz has never been a favourite actress of mine, sometimes I find her especially annoying but the role as a stalker fits her very well. Penelope Cruz gave an agreeable performance as well, she developed a great character who I could fall in love with too.<br/><br/>Anyway, it is a controversial film from many aspects, you will love it or hate it.<br/><br/>My rate is 10 out of 10."

I have since picked up the DVD.<br/><br/>There are many complexities and subtle nuances throughout the film, and you might find yourself asking ""what the hell is going on?"" And many people criticize the film for that, but these people are missing the point. This movie is about beauty. And if you get confused, it's OK! That isn't important.

And I guess my maturation since I originally saw it really did wonders, because this movie gripped me like few others do. I'd say it's probably my second favorite movie of all time, right behind Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind. The casting is perfect, and the characters are very interesting and believable as human beings. The music is what really grips me. Every song fits perfectly with the scene (except the REM song at the beginning when Cruise and Lee are in the car). The pacing is brilliant, never revealing too much too soon and never having a dull moment either. I have a hard time watching this movie without crying because it just teaches the viewer (assuming they are mature enough to get what this movie is really about) so much about life, how short it is, and how everything in life is sweeter if you've had the hard things to through."

Memorable dialogue and music.  After watching the film, I felt like running out to buy the soundtrack!  Peter Gabriel's Solsbury Hill never sounded so good and even The Beach Boys Good Vibrations took on a new lease of life.<br/><br/>
All the leads are excellent, but Tom Cruise gives a tour de force performance. I became completely caught up in his anguish and confusion.<br/><br/>Watch out for the Times Square sequence at the beginning of the film.  It was an unnerving experience for both Tom Cruise and myself and gave a good foretaste of the suspense and mystery to follow.<br/><br/>I have watched the film three times so far, and am still finding new things in it.

","A wealthy playboy (Tom Cruise) suddenly finds himself in jail for the murder of the woman he loves. Flashbacks show how he ditches his former girlfriend or `f***-buddy' (played by Cameron Diaz) and falls for another woman (played by Penelope Cruz). He gets in the car with Diaz however and she deliberately drives off a bridge, killing herself and leaving Cruise terribly disfigured. He settles down with Cruz but starts to have what seem like psychotic episodes where he mistakes her for Diaz. The ending is well worth the wait and explains the mystery completely. It's not an incredibly tortuous affair either. Everything is explained, but you have to pay attention  sadly some critics who admit to being `puzzled' couldn't be bothered to do this and it shows painfully in the reviews. There are also some gem-like scenes  for instance when Cruise does a pencil drawing of Cruz early on and draws a wonderful likeness that is at the same time more beautiful than the girl has yet shown herself to be, or the moment when Diaz looks helplessly on as an epitome of sadness  the `girl with the martini'. There are many metaphors that can be drawn about stardom but it is a movie worth seeing for its own story. (Stay for the final credits  you not only get Paul McCartney's beautiful Oscar-nominated title-song, but the haunting melody that it seamlessly fades into and which is sung by Diaz.)"

","I think the first time I saw this movie, I didn't totally understand it and as I grew older, I grew wiser :) This is the third or forth time I have seen Vanilla Sky and if you follow the story about David and the small messages you should be able to make a point out of it or at least understand the message it sent me. What is happiness to you? This is different for different people and in the end I think real happiness is to understand that you need to be happy in real life and you can't keep living in a dream world. At least this is happiness to me. Everything in life is a choice and now and then this is what life is all about, making choices that leads to other things, greater things in life, or less happy things in life. All though I'd like to think that the end was happy to David and he got the happiness that he deserved. Is happiness really to be good looking or rich or is there a higher purpose to happiness. I think there is and I think he did realize this eventually :) Vanilla Sky is a great movie and should be watched not only once, but twice or three times or more to be honest. This movie is brilliant and becomes more brilliant for each time I watch it."

Today they showed Vanilla Sky on TV and as I had nothing better to do... and as it turned out, I would have had a hard time finding anything better to do. Vanilla Sky is a frightening, sad and touching movie, actually one of the best I've seen in a while. I was surprised by how I was affected watching it. It's hard to explain, but during the movie your feelings towards the characters and your perception of what is going on changes and it's quite an emotional journey.

Instead of a story about a wealthy arrogant man who lost it all and has to learn humility, it shifts in a completely different direction ever so slowly. It's hard to follow and its numerous twists will hit you like a bullet, but the volatility of this movie makes it a complete joy. <br/><br/>Vanilla Sky is one of the most ambitious mix of genres you could possibly imagine: romance, drama, thriller, mind-bender, sci-fi and others.

"costia_ullens","2","2","3","15 April 2011"," ""Abre los ojos"" for dummies.
","Though Vanilla Sky is not a bad movie per se, it is on the other hand a terrible remake of a great movie. We can see how Crowe tried to stick to Amenábar's screenplay scene by scene, how he tried to make an identical movie but shot in the U.S. with Hollywood stars. A pointless idea to start with, but never mind. We also can see how Crowe got lost pretty soon.<br/><br/>The characters lost their depth and complexity. They all come out with one trait only. Crowe succeeded in making the originally charming and fascinating girls look like teenage cheerleaders. Don't even get me started on the male characters. The dialogues lost their sharpness and delicacy ; the original meaningful calm scenes and silences were replaced by hysterical shouting, maybe to make it easier to the public to understand when someone is not happy. The relationship between the characters has also been damaged. This comes first as a result of the simplified-minded characters, but also as facts : for example, Crowe unbalances the forces between the two main male characters who were originally childhood friends by making one the employee of the other.<br/><br/>But, well, the original genius plot stays, and I can see why so many people loved that film. Nevertheless I think many of those people would change their mind if they watched the original ""Abre los ojos"" masterpiece. Remaking a film is worthy if it aims to adapt a basic plot to a whole other context, in order to give it a new standpoint, new insights. This is not the case. I felt I was watching ""Abre los ojos"" for dummies."

","To anyone who says that Cruise was miscast in this role, I strongly disagree. It was his stereotypical and flashy good looks that made this role so right for him. It strengthens the story of a man who has a perfect life taken away from him. To see Cruise vulnerable and broken was refreshing, and i believe he portrayed this character very well.<br/><br/>...But to offer a different role that was miscast, Sophia. I don't see much beauty and attraction in Penelope Cruz, and at the risk of sounding shallow, if you are going to make a story about a man who is driven by infatuation of a women to , ultimately, his death..make the chick hot...some may disagree with that but that's how i saw it."

","Contrary to many other opinions of this movie I actually thought it was superb. My opinion of Tom Cruise was greatly improved after this movie, due to it being his first performance where he couldn't hide behind his waxwork perfect good looks and blinding toothy smile, and thought he handled the bored playboy character with surprising ease. The movie on its own was typical Cameron Crowe, discovering hidden parts of the movie every time you watch it and great use of music on the score. I did however think that the big reason for this movie hitting a chord with me was the 'missed opportunity at love' storyline. It hits the right note with anyone who's been in a similar situation and would not be advisable to watch after a messy break-up. However one final reason to watch should be the supporting cast, Jason Lee (as always) being outstanding as the easy going best mate, Cameron Diaz and Penelope Cruz as eye candy for the boys and Messers Cruise and Lee for the ladies; need I say more ?!?!?!"
"FilmOtaku","7","2","3","28 March 2005"," A worthy remake
","""Vanilla Sky"", Cameron Crowe's remake of the 1997 film ""Abre los Ojos"", written and directed by Alejandro Amenabar, had two potential strikes against it from the onset: It was a remake of a film that was made four years prior, and it was a remake of a film where the original reeked of sheer genius. Luckily, Crowe was able to overcome these two hurdles and make a solid film that stands on its own merits.<br/><br/>""Vanilla Sky"" centers around David Aames, (Cruise) a spoiled rich kid who has inherited his father's vast wealth and publishing empire. David is an attractive man (and knows it) who lives a jet-set lifestyle that involves having as much fun as possible in every given moment. Julie Gianni (Diaz), a girl with whom he has a casual ""sleeping arrangement"" is not able to subscribe to this lifestyle and when she tries to glean more from the relationship, is cast aside. On the night of his birthday party, David's best friend Brian (Lee) brings his new friend Sofia (Cruz), and the two develop an instant connection. In an attempt to get away from the now stalkerish Julie, the two escape to Sofia's small apartment and proceed to have a wonderful, meaningful evening together wherein David's life seems to have changed for the better. On his way out the door, he runs into Julie, who has followed him to Sofia's apartment, and she convinces him to drive with her so he can ""make it up to her"". What happens during the rest of the film is a mixture of intrigue, murder and romance, at times blossoming and others faltering, and eventually becomes a race for David to find out the truth about what is really happening with his life and those who are involved in it.<br/><br/>I didn't want to get too spoilerish with the plot summary, because although the trailer for the film don't hide a lot in terms of plot points, some things that happen are still more shocking when you simply see them for yourself. ""Vanilla Sky"" has an intriguing and interesting plot that sincerely kept me guessing until the last five minutes of the film, something I was not expecting from a Cameron Crowe film. Cruise's David Aames is like Jerry Maguire if he was even more of an asshole in the beginning; charming, but so self-centered he practically leaks smarminess from his pores. I actually didn't think Crowe had it in him to produce such a well-executed psychological drama, but ""Vanilla Sky"" is a very good film. Once again, Crowe shines with his use of music, something that he has never faltered on. From ""Say Anything"" to ""Almost Famous"", he has exhibited the uncanny knack to take a song that is either historically beloved in its own right or one that one would never think to use in a particular film, and insert it into a scene that is so fitting that the song and scene become married to one another immediately. He did this with Peter Gabriel's ""In Your Eyes"" in ""Say Anything"", he did it with ""Tiny Dancer"" in ""Almost Famous"" and the great musical moment (in my opinion) in ""Vanilla Sky"" was near the end when ""Good Vibrations"" by the Beach Boys is playing over a semi-chaotic scene. I'm not sure if this is one of them yet, but Crowe's knack for turning simple scenes into iconic moments in film is staggering and admirable.<br/><br/>The acting in ""Vanilla Sky"" is decent enough, none of it was really a stretch for Cruise, and Jason Lee was his usual laid-back self. The surprising performances for me personally were Cruz and Kurt Russell, who played a court-appointed psychologist. I'm not a fan of Penelope Cruz, but I found her casting to be absolutely perfect (not a stretch since she reprised her role from the Amenabar original). She was cute and quirky, but her vulnerability was so subtle that anytime I felt any kind of emotion, it was usually in response to a scene she was guiding. Also, Kurt Russell, a mediocre actor at best, was great as the psychologist; his strength and warmth are so low key that when a significant plot point about him is revealed at the end, you almost have to slap your forehead in an ""Oh yeah!"" reaction.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed seeing ""Abre Los Ojos"", and I think that it still has advantages other than its originality over ""Vanilla Sky"". But when gauging a film like ""Vanilla Sky"", a film that can be criticized as being Hollywoodized, bastardized and super-sized, it is a testimony to the film and filmmakers that it came out as good as it did. Being a foreign-film and independent film lover, I'll always like ""Abre Los Ojos"" thismuch better, but ""Vanilla Sky"" is a worthy remake. I highly recommend both. 7/10 --Shelly"

","I was surprised by Last Samurai, hugely disappointed by Collateral, but was still in the video stores looking for more Tom Cruise. What's wrong with me? Have I turned into a fanatical Tom Cruise stalker in the past few months? Well, the last time I checked I have yet to start dotting my I's with hearts, so I should be in the clear. No, rather I think that since the days of Cocktail and Days of Thunder, Tom Cruise has chosen better and better work for himself with each project he commits to. Ever since Magnolia my respect for this internationally renowned mega-star has consistently increased movie by movie, although the overall quality of the movie sans Cruise still remains a crap-shoot. Take, for example, the OPEN YOUR EYES Americanized remake, VANILLA SKY.<br/><br/>I started watching VANILLA SKY with my girlfriend, and about thirty minutes into the movie I started looking at my watch wishing it to be over. The Cruise, Cruz, Diaz, Lee love quadrangle starts of ordinary as hell, and I was mumbling to myself, oh great, another plastic family feud flick. Why didn't I just watch Friends instead, saving myself from this boredom.<br/><br/>At the thirty minute mark, Cameron Diaz snaps like a flaky twig and drives Cruise and herself off a bridge. In sixty seconds the Friends-fest turns into a psychotic nightmare, and from there on out, VANILLA SKY runs its course as deranged as a Cronenberg film to the end in this grotesquely beautiful film.<br/><br/>Anyone who's ever felt confined knows what it's like to hear things that aren't there, to believe in conspiracies, and to have waking life haunted by self-generated fiction. Cruise starts to lose his mind, no longer sure whether Cruz is Diaz or whether Cruise ever knew Cruz to begin with. VANILLA SKY portrays the insanity with simple and editing, paying homage to Bergman's Persona. My girlfriend and I took a cigarette break two-thirds into the movie, and she admitted that she was beginning to feel a little crazy herself. It's okay, don't worry. Sometimes these movies get to you.<br/><br/>I've been trying to figure out why it isn't as popular as other Cruise movies, and I'm beginning to think that Cameron Crowe probably intended to fool the movie-going public around the world. Please imagine with me the following scenario. Nothing sexy is playing over the weekend, so you bring your family to VANILLA SKY since it has Cameron Diaz and since it might be like the Mask that your family loved so much. After going through psychotic hell and back, you storm out of the theaters saying, honestly, I don't know what's happening to America these days, but I'm going to write the mayor about this god forsaken vanilla trash. It's those crazy communist bastards in Hollywood destroying this country, you know. Our taxes used to go to decent, American Tom Cruise movies that make you feel good and sure of yourself. Now all you got is What, honey? Crazy? No, I'm not crazy, you're the one with the hippie parents! C'Mon kids, get into the freaking car! I'm cold.<br/><br/>I can't comment on OPEN YOUR EYES since I haven't seen it.<br/><br/>You know, the next Cruise movie should be a martial arts flick with Keanu Reeves Hong Kong style.

","Vanilla Sky (2001)<br/><br/>Plot In A Paragraph: A self-indulgent and vain publishing magnate (Cruise) finds his privileged life upended after a car accident.<br/><br/>This movie devided people when it was released. Some loved it, some hated it, and there was a while bunch of people, who didn't had a clue what was going on. I have never rewatched it since 2001. I didn't mind it back then, and have never cared to revisit it. <br/><br/>Difficult to follow at times, but the performances are spot on!! Cruise gives a very solid performance here. Kurt Russell is reliable in his small role, Penelope Cruz is very appealing, but it's Cameron Diaz who surprised me!! She is very believable in a difficult role. Not only must she be the playful girlfriend and the demented lover, but she has to mimic Cruz's actions during two key sequences.<br/><br/>I enjoyed it, a lot more the second time around, helped by the vague memory of what was going on. <br/><br/>Vanilla Sky grossed $100 million at the domestic box office to end 2001 the 20th highest grossing movie of the year."

","wow! I know there will be many who disagree with my views on this movie, but there are also many who will agree.<br/><br/>Vanilla Sky is just fantastic.  It has a quite original twist than most movies around.  Because of this twist, it is one of those great movies such as 'the Sixth Sense' and 'Arlington Road' which after watching it, you feel as though you HAVE to see it again, now that you know what is really happening throughout the film.  Without spoiling it too much for others who haven't seen it, there is a certain feature in the plot which is shown throughout many times and you don't realise just how important it is until the end.  Vanilla Sky is also the only film which i have seen twice at the cinema.<br/><br/>On another note, i have never thought too highly of Tom Cruise before, and never considered him a good actor.  His performance in his role in this movie, changed my opinion.  i have never seen him act like this before and it all added to the greatness of this movie."
"Khwaj","7","1","1","17 April 2002"," Confusing, mindbending did I miss something?
","I no idea what I was leading myself into when I first took a glimpse of Vanilla Sky?<br/><br/>I mean sure it was another Tom Cruise flick re-uniting with 'Jerry Maguire' favorite Cameron Crowe and throwing in the likes of Penelope Cruz, Jason Lee, Kurt Russel and the un-avoidable Cameron Diaz but there was something about this film I didn't quite catch.  . . .?<br/><br/>To begin with I heard it was a remake of a Spanish film ""Open your Eyes"" and secondly the story was not was it was meant to be then I realized that maybe it wasn't such a good idea?<br/><br/>The confusing aspect about the story was Tom Cruise's character' a successful millionaire who's claimed everything only one could ever dream of and then meeting the girl of his dreams (real-life love interest Penelope Cruz).<br/><br/>The story then begins to take a somewhat ""abstract"" turning point when past girlfriend Cameron Diaz turns up taking our lead for a ride only to end up committing suicide by driving off a bridge. All in the name of love I might add.<br/><br/>What you end up experiencing is a series flashbacks of present day events and wonderful vivid dream like sequences. Which sends a host of ""should I say"" unanswered questions.<br/><br/>For me this film reminded more of a Dario Argento formula: Stylish camera work and set design not to mention awkward scenario.<br/><br/>Although this is my first time seeing a virtual remake it's not surprising in the least how some of these big time directors dish out bucket loads of cash on sprucing up old cuts with style and vision. The one image that many will reflect upon is the Times Square scenario, in which Tom Crusie gets out his car and begins to run through an isolated environment (note: Cameron Crowe had closed off Times Square for an hour just capture this one beautiful scene).<br/><br/>All in all not bad, but when watching this film it began to remind me of other mindbending films that had me on the rebound (Total Recall, Twelve Monkeys and Fight Club).<br/><br/>With alot of style but little appreciation towards story, I'd probably have to say that this is a slight let down. The film too began to suffer from an identity crises. Whatever you may think I couldn't but feel robbed as your never left feeling satisfied as to whether he was dreaming or not?<br/><br/>Stylish but not impressive. 7/10"
"MisterHussein","8","1","1","6 February 2002"," Intensely stimulating
","After watching this film i believe Tom Cruise is grossly underated as an actor, this performance really does deserve an Oscar. Vanilla Sky is an intensely stimulating film, however, it almost got too much for me half way through. But with a little perseverance and patience, even if you do feel overwhelmed and slightly lost, the rewards are well worth the work. The films great cast and script make it well worth watching and in my opinion this is probably Tom Cruise's best performance to date. An amazing yet slightly disturbing film, I loved it!"
"Pingo-2","7","1","1","6 February 2002"," Not as actionpacked as Total Recall and not as good as Memento...
","Not as actionpacked as Total Recall and not as good as Memento, but Vanilla Sky do have its own qualities.<br/><br/>--- May contain spoilers! ---<br/><br/>I haven't seen the film which this one is based upon (Abre los ojos (1997)), so I don't know what is changed and how much. However, Tom Cruise does a good job holding the pieces together, and I actually got surprised at the turning point in the film - something I haven't been by an American movies since... well, I can't remember ANY US-film that actually surprised me and really turned like this one did.<br/><br/>Vanilla Sky is much like a non-US-film (foreign film to you Americans!), in the way it tells its story and the pace. It is very non-American in a good way.<br/><br/>The story is not original though. The same story is told in Total Recall, and the setting (on Mars) works better there, since its a strange future world anyway. In Vanilla Sky the story (which doesn't unfold completely until about an hour in the movie) feels a bit unreal - actually EVERYTHING feels unreal! Yes, the sky IS Vanilla, and it too is very unreal. Of course everything is made so we shall doubt it, but why make it so obvious doubtable?<br/><br/>Not that Vanilla Sky doesn't work - it does. It is in many ways a very fine film. Especially the cast is impressive. Good choices to cast Cameron Diaz and Kurt Russell. They fit perfectly in their roles and make the story something remembarable, but Cruz is a bit, how shall I put it... boring?!<br/><br/>Cruise have made some really low and bad films lately. I didn't at all like Eyes Wide Shut, I thought that film was an overlengthed soft-porn. I mean, if you want to show naked people you can at least do it RIGHT. Eyes Wide Shut didn't have a point at all, but Vanilla Sky has! <br/><br/>The two films have some similarities when it comes to the first story that we totally belive in the first part of Vanilla Sky. We are told that Cruise's character, David, head of a large corporation has been framed by the evil board of directors; the Seven Dwarfs. This kind of conspiracy is something similar to the conspiracy in Eyes Wide Shut, but here it doesn't get silly and it actually have a very good point to hold the story together.<br/><br/>One bad thing about Cruise is that he creates very long movies. Usually I am a big fan of extreme-lengthed films, but only if it is needed to tell the story. THE STAND for instance work as a six hour movie (even though it was made for TV, it works as a movie) but both Vanilla Sky, Eyes Wide Shut and Cruise' Jerry McGuire are too long.<br/><br/>Vanilla Sky could have been shortened 15-30 minutes or so, especially in the beginning when it's painfully slow and doesn't really say anything interesting.<br/><br/>Vanilla Sky uses some visual tricks to tell its story. It twists and turns the timeline which is very useful to create confusion. This works better in other movies, like Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction and of course, Memento. In the end, Vanilla Sky uses these tricks just to impress, not to bring the film forward.<br/><br/>I was a bit afraid of a silly A.I.-kind of ending, but luckily they skipped it. I hated A.I. since it was awful and boring, and the end-scenes in Vanilla Sky has some similarities, but Vanilla Sky works better and faster and says what it needs to say in the few minutes the end unfolds.<br/><br/>If you want to see a fast cool film with brain-experiments and twists and turns, watch Total Recall. Its much better than Vanilla Sky in many ways. However, if you can't stand Arnold or don't want the violence, maybe you should go for Memento. If Memento is too confusing, then sure, Vanilla Sky is totally made for you!<br/><br/>I give it a 7 out of 10. Its a good movie, too long, but in the end very interesting."

The film is about actions-and-consequences - which makes a change from Hollywood's usual fixation with ""fate"". It has this in common with another Cruise movie - Magnolia - which (among its many themes) was also about choices - and their consequences. This movie is about something important - hang in there and you'll get it. Good acting (even from TC), great music and the two leading women - wow!"

","Tom Cruise is very good, as are several of the other actors (Russell, Diaz, Cruz), but Cameron Crowe fails to create any sense of excitement.  The pacing is extremely slow, with long pauses between lines of dialog, and slow pacing of movement and action within the scenes.  Also, the story shuttles back and forth between what may be dream and what may be reality so often that after a while, the audience simply ceases to care whether what they're watching is ""real"" or not. <br/><br/>    The idea is hardly original.  Yes, this is a remake, but the basic ideas of the story go back to 1940s pulp magazines, where they were usually developed in a more compelling and exciting fashion. <br/><br/>    Crowe wanted to call the far superior ""Almost Famous"" ""Vanilla Sky,"" which indicates just how meaningless the title is."
"paul_supercala","9","1","1","11 December 2001"," Another great Crowe film definitely worth catching in the theatre...
","Cameron Crowe has delivered us another amazing film. This is very close to being his best one yet. With incredible performances from Tom Cruise and Kurt Russell and solid support from Cameron Diaz and Jason Lee, the casting couldn't have been better. You can also almost see the true-life romance unfold between Cruise and co-star Penelope Cruz. Actually an adaptation of the 1997 Spanish film ""Abre los Ojos"", this ""Americanized"" version is even more interesting in the original. Tom Cruise is surprisingly believable as a disfigured man who has trouble deciphering what is or is not real. The film takes the viewer on a roller coaster ride that never really slows down in its 2 1/2 hour run. It has moments that might be hard for many to follow and also leaves you to draw your own conclusions, which might drive some people crazy. It never really follows the structure of a standard ""multiplex"" film, which is also why it is so enjoyable and refreshing. Crowe has shown us how he can shine commercially with ""Jerry Maguire"" and ""Say Anything"", but has really gone out on a limb with this one. Some might compare it to ""Magnolia"", which isn't such a bad thing, but it is a little confusing at times. The ending is also a little strange and will sit well with some and not others. Also worth mentioning is the soundtrack, which works along with the film in a way the only a few others, like Paul Thomas Anderson, have done in the past. Some of the haunting and beautiful images are intensified by the importance of the music in the scene. This one is definitely worth checking out in the theatre if you're going to see it at all. For fans of Cameron Crowe, this will be well worth it for you. For everyone else, it is important to remember to keep an open mind when seeing this. The film is definitely well made; it's just not the typical flashy blockbuster Tom Cruise fans may have come to expect."
"MovieAddict2016","6","5","12","26 April 2005"," Better than expected, still doesn't hold a candle to the original though
","""Vanilla Sky"" suffers from a bit of mainstream Americanalization. (Is that a word? I don't think so, but oh well.) It's the US taking a popular and successful foreign film (the Spanish ""Obres Los Ojos,"" a.k.a. ""Open Your Eyes"") and re-working it with... Tom Cruise in the lead? ""Vanilla Sky"" is, then, the ultimate cliché of the America/remake fascination inherent in most mainstream Hollywood films these days. People on this site love to bash Hollywood for doing this - they consistently take foreign films and remake them with popular American names. Casting Cruise is a bit too much of a cliché to be true. He's America's most popular actor alive (statistically, anyway).<br/><br/>Surprising, then, that the movie isn't bad. In fact, it's quite good, at least in a watchable sort of way. Although it doesn't hold a candle to the original, Cameron Crowe (""Fast Times"" scribe and ""Jerry Maguire"" director) is still pretty capable behind the camera and Cameron Diaz proves she has some amount of acting abilities as she portrays a character unlike any other in her resume.<br/><br/>The big disappointment is Penelope Cruz, returning to her role in the Spanish film, only this time playing it in English. And she's not very good at speaking English and we have to wonder, ""Why did they cast her?"" Plus, and maybe this is just me... but I don't find her very attractive. Between her and Diaz, I'd take Diaz, even if she was a suicidal maniac.<br/><br/>Overall I was rather entertained and amused by the film, even if it's nothing special. And believe me, it's not. But Tom Cruise is better than expected. And his notorious vanity pays off -- we finally get to see his face all messed up. Alas, he can't remain like this for the entire duration of the film. That would be American Hollywood sacrilege. I can just hear the producers: ""Tom Cruise playing a facially disfigured man? WHAT?!"""

","This film had such potential, but it failed in the end because it gave the viewers far too little credit. This should have been an existential, philosophical, psychological thriller, and up until about the last ten minutes, it was. But rather than let the viewer try to figure out what's going on, rather than force the viewer to open his mind to the possibilities of multiple realities and to answer the questions of identity and sanity and reality raised in the first two hours of the film, it succinctly and in unremarkable language explains what was going on the whole time. <br/><br/>This kind of convenient resolution is all too common in ""suspense"" movies (see also, Training Day(2001); Arlington Road (1999)) and is dissatisfying to people who actually want to interpret the film. It is typical of filmmakers who are unwilling to take a chance, namely that their film will be misunderstood. Of course when suspense is well done (see, Memento(2000); Usual Suspects, The(1995); Birth(2004)), the filmmaker need not worry whether his intentions were communicated. <br/><br/>The end of Vanilla Sky, and thus the film as a whole, is a symptom of the trend among timid screenwriters to rely on a dubious plot device to make sense of an otherwise weak script. The real tragedy in this case is that the film would likely have been much stronger without this device."

He's got an occasional sex partner in Cameron Diaz, but a chance meeting in a bar with Penelope Cruz, tells him she's the one.<br/><br/>But it's not to be after he gets into an automobile accident and becomes horribly disfigured. We're talking here about a man not used to having too many really bad life curves tossed at him. However with his wealth he can take an option not too many of us have. Cruise gets himself cryogenically frozen with a 150 year expiration date in the hope that science will develop the technology to fix his face. He even gets to dream with implanted images of the good times.<br/><br/>Director Cameron Crowe used some old movie clips for things Cruise identified with in Vanilla Sky. The one that would have explained it all was from Forbidden Planet where Warren Stevens after he takes the Krel brain test, tells Leslie Nielsen that those Krel forgot all about the Id. It's that Id that keeps screwing up Tom's dream, turning it into a big old nightmare. <br/><br/>Vanilla Sky is a good film, could have been a lot better for me if I had some warning of what was going on. The film is like a big budget remake in some ways of The Trial, that Kafka drama that starred Anthony Perkins and Orson Welles.

Romance, lust, horror, tragedy, comedy. It's all there and realised superbly.<br/><br/>The acting is excellent, the story is intelligent and the direction is tight, but for me the high point was the perfect selection of music for each scene (maybe just because I like Radiohead and REM) which pushes home the true emotion and beauty (sometimes tragic) in this grossly underrated masterpiece.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen it do.

This version had several main problems for me. To begin, this film added a lot of back story about the main character which just needlessly complicated the story. The original was very sharp in that respect. Additionally, this film didn't leave very much to the imagination, going into long expository at times that broke the fast-paced flow of the original. Finally, the music used in this film seemed to take center stage and some of it seemed very inappropriate for the tension of film.

But Tom Cruise's performance was, I believe, not good enough. Jason Lee, like always, was his best as the much-talking friend that doesn't like to shut up. <br/><br/>If you're going to remake a movie do it well, do it original, and do it for purpose. OK, so i disagreed when Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes was released and it was different to the first and I thought that Tim should not have tried to match the original classic.

","A reasonably intelligent psychological examination of the nature of love, lust and life in general. Experienced movie goers get clued in to the kind of film we're watching right from the opening when Cruise cruises around a deserted New York. In some ways this was probably a mistake since, although a lot of what happens seems to make no sequential sense, we already know to distrust what we see. This detracts from the emotional involvement required to get the maximum impact. I personally didn't even believe that Sophia was remotely real and was quite surprised to discover that she did, in fact, exist.<br/><br/>Stories of this nature are more satisfyingly terrifying when the ultimate basis of the main character's experience is psychological. Unwilling to go all the way, the makers of this movie draw the tooth of insanity by creating a pseudo-science fiction explanation for all that has gone before. As is frequently the case when people not fully versed in the genre attempt science fiction, this story has a gaping logical hole in it, which need be plugged only with a single line of explanatory dialogue which was not forthcoming. We are all familiar with the concept of cryogenic freezing of a corpse after death, with the idea of being revived in the distant future when the battle against death itself has been won by our descendants. But this film takes the idea one step further - that you can spend your ""death"" living out a fantasy - a ""Lucid Dream"". What they completely fail to explain is how exactly a dead person, a corpse with a dead brain, which is being deep frozen in order to cease all activity and the changes wrought by time to enable revival centuries hence; how such a dead body, then, is supposed to *experience* the said Lucid Dream. Such an ability represents a victory against death even better than physical revival would be. You wouldn't even wait to die in order to experience a perfect life from whatever moment you wish, you'd pay large amounts of money to experience such a thing without dying. So why bother with the antiquated idea of cryogenic freezing of the corpse after death (necessitating Aames to have undertaken a suicide that was impossible to believe in, knowing the character) when he could simply have decided to get frozen and live a better life?<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is very good as the man who sees a different kind of life possible through the sight and brief encounter with Sophia, and later excellent as a man dealing with the solitary life of a disfigured man. However, Penélope Cruz is considerably less adept at displaying exactly what it is supposed to be that Cruise is falling in love with, although this is really down to her part being underwritten.<br/><br/>To the user whose comment asked for a response to his theory that the whole thing was an examination of David Aames fear and rejection of his own love for Julie (Cameron Diaz's character), I'm afraid that user has been blinded by the fact that the woman is played by Cameron Diaz. There is absolutely nothing in the film or in her performance to suggest that she is anything but the villainess of the piece, the ultimately suicidal, violently obsessive stalker that she is intended to be. Diaz plays the part very well and courageously, and any attempt to see her character as being any better than she is supposed to be is basically a detrimental opinion of her performance."

Its greatness lies essentially in its opening line ""Open your eyes""...the only problem IS, you need to have SEEN the film to realise the staggering implications of what you are hearing. OPEN YOUR EYES of course was the original Spanish film from masterful newcomer Alejandro Amenaber who scaled the heights in Hollywood with this year's THE OTHERS. Rather than identify the film in question, aware viewers may well feel a sense of deja vu here, recalling to mind the line ""Open your mind...open your mind"" which was surely a precursor, if not the inspiration behind both films. Functioning along multiple awareness channels throughout its 153 minute run-time, VANILLA SKY is alternately, intellectually challenging and emotionally involving. Whether you view it as a thriller, a black comedy, outrageous sci-fi or even JERRY MAGUIRE on acid, this is pure brain-drain, a ""fix"" for the fanciful!<br/><br/>The opening scenes, as Cruise finds himself in a totally deserted Times Square, seemingly in ""virtual"" impossibility sets the viewer up for what is to follow - a mind-trip through hell and beyond the infinite, literally!!! Think MATRIX, JACOBS LADDER, THE SIXTH SENSE, FIGHT CLUB and one other that I shall sensibly refrain from nominating and yes, they are ALL here, but still the mystery remains!<br/><br/>Tom Cruise as millionaire playboy David Aames who inherits 51% controlling interest in his father's publishing empire, is a lost soul. Trouble is, right now he doesn't realise HOW lost! That this is the performance of his career is without question - its the performance of ANYONE's career! Running the gamut of experiences, from smartass yuppie to emotionally decimated and disfigured Joe Blow, the film orbits his character as surely as the planets in our solar system. As his legal advisor, Kurt Russell gives HIS greatest performance too, aided as it is by a script of sheer genius. Cameron Diaz, playing his long-suffering and heartbroken lover of convenience Julie Gianni, turns in one awesomely vivid performance, one that can only end in tragedy - though DOES it? You can never assume that what you see was actually what you think you saw!<br/><br/>As for Penelope Cruz, reprising her role as Sophia Serrano in OPEN YOUR EYES, she really is a cutie. The chemistry between her and Cruise is just so obvious and up there for all to see. It is easy to see what Cruise could see in HER that Nicole Kidman could never exude in three lifetimes... at least, I can see it!<br/><br/>Like 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, the last quarter of an hour will either blow your mind or leave you cold, wondering ""Hmm what was all that about?"" Anyone NOT moved by the Gregory Peck/Bob Dylan revelations (this will make sense ONLY if you have seen this flick) should never have been watching this film in the first place, while the very last ten seconds of VANILLA SKY must wring and hang out to dry, whatever emotions the aware viewer has left, after this movie experience of a lifetime.<br/><br/>Yeah, I liked it!"

","""How strange the human mind is; this center of activity wherein perceptions of reality are formed and stored, and in which one's view of the world hinges on the finely tuned functioning of the brain, this most delicate and intricate processor of all things sensory. And how much do we really know of it's inner-workings, of it's depth or capacity? What is it in the mind that allows us to discern between reality and a dream? Or can we? Perhaps our sense of reality is no more than an impression of what we actually see, like looking at a painting by Monet, in which the vanilla sky of his vision becomes our reality. It's a concept visited by filmmaker Cameron Crowe in his highly imaginative and consciousness-altering film, `Vanilla Sky,' starring Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz."" (Courtesy of ""jhclues"".

Above commentary excerpt were quoted from an IMDB user. As it somehow offered a better description of 'Vanilla Sky' than anything I could capably come up with, I decided to preface it to my very personal thoughts on a movie which has catapulted itself to be my all-time favourite film.<br/><br/>I was overwhelmed with an inexplicable epiphany as I followed the journey of David Aames. With each passing scene, it became alarmingly clear to me that someone out there had an uncanny empathy and intuitive understanding of a particular state of mind. A state of mind that might be momentarily experienced by us all at some points of our life. But that it cut right through me. For, with tears and fears, I have been experiencing what David Aames experienced, for the past twelve years.....<br/><br/>No. I am not a deranged schizonerd delighting in psycho babble(thank you very much). But I knew there and then that I am not alone in my 'struggles' and I do not need to be afraid anymore. That somehow, in the process of watching this life affirming film, 'David Aames' has reached out to all the 'Davids' of the world(and you will know who you are). <br/><br/>Through it, we are offered an alternative. That is, to take comfort in our experiences and to know that we are free to decide ""whether our glass is half empty or half full?"" And with that realisation, I achieved closure. I was vindicated. And I hope you too will find your way.<br/><br/>I do not expect most people to understand what I am trying to say so far, as this personal piece is written with an expressed intention not to reveal vital plot revelation within this mind bending yet spiritually relevant film. <br/><br/>But for those who have seen 'Vanilla Sky', if you are experiencing(in whatever doses) what David Aames experienced, do not fear this unknown realm of mindscapes for it is an opportunity for you to free your mind. Take control and despair not. For you are not alone. <br/><br/>If you are willing, open your eyes....."

","A Tom Cruise vanity project: incoherent, senseless, confused and overlong. Cameron Crowe's Almost Famous was a delight, but Vanilla Sky's script, direction, casting and editing are a mess. Looking for SOMETHING a group of six friends could go to this weekend in San Diego, I nixed our seeing Sidewalks of New York as I'd heard it was endlessly talkative, and foolishly suggested we try Vanilla Sky instead. Well, some of our group thought this movie the worst in years. More boring than House of Mirth, more absurd than Eyes Wide Shut, more obscure than Memento and more embarrassing than Quills, we suffered to the end. When I couldn't take it, I looked at the floor or audience. Cruise's toothy smile is bad enough but his distorted car crash mask is harder to take. Penelope Cruz seemed vacuous--supposedly better in the Abre Los Ojos original, which I've not seen. Kurt Russell as a shrink is a joke, and only Cameron Diaz seemed adequately cast, though she's not on camera long enough. (For charisma, she easily trumps Penelope Cruz.) Plot motivation is thin, the music's an arbitrary rock hodgepodge, editing is MTV-style, and the film's muddled concept perhaps appealed to Cruise due to his belief in Scientology. 1 out of 10."

I honestly don't know why I sat through this garbage. ""This movie is supposed to make you think.""

All he seems to do is get angry for no reason, smile like the Cheshire cat and feel ridiculously sorry for himself. I wish that at the end instead of waking up he'd been squashed.

"Lounge_Act","10","3","7","4 June 2004"," Confusing, thought-provoking, strangely moving.
","Spoilers within.<br/><br/>There's a lot of talk about how Vanilla Sky is inferior when compared to the movie it is based on, called ""Abre Los Ojos."" But I've never seen the original film, so I can objectively say that I enjoyed Vanilla Sky very much, without worrying about how it compares with the original. The first time I watched it, I was thoroughly confused. It was thought-provoking, yes, but a lot of things didn't make sense. Only in subsequent viewings did I really tie everything together and get the most out of what is really an excellent movie.<br/><br/>The basic premise of the movie is that the exorbitantly wealthy David Aames (Cruise) is running a company he inherited from his father. He lives his life without thinking of the consequences of his actions: he treats his 'friend' Julie (Diaz) carelessly, and when she finds out that he has really fallen in love with another woman, Sofia (Cruz), things take a grim turn for the worst. At this point, David's life seems to take on many dream-like qualities, and it's difficult for him to decide what is real and what isn't, and who his friends really are.<br/><br/>There are a lot of twists and turns in the movie, and in many cases when you think there's a resolution, things just take on another turn. Even if you didn't like the movie, there's no question that after seeing it, you will be thinking about it and speculating for a long time after its over. And in my opinion, that's one of the best things you can say about a movie.<br/><br/>What I also liked about the movie was the music that went along with it. There's a lot of good songs that in my opinion, go perfectly with the scenes, and they make for some truly moving moments (the '3-day Memorial' scene still gives me the chills). This is a good time to mention that Jason Lee's performance was just uncanny. I haven't seen him in many serious roles, but he just did a great job. I never thought that a movie like this would be as moving to me as this was, and I still have not seen a lot of movies that were able to evoke the kind of emotions that Vanilla Sky did.<br/><br/>Certainly, a lot of people may feel like this was just a big marathon run only to wind up right where you started. But even so, I recommend this movie to anyone, especially someone who enjoys a so called Thinking Man's movie.<br/><br/>8.5/10"
"zachrosenau","Null","3","7","24 January 2004"," A Richly Poor Film (spoilers)
","Cameron Crowe has not been able to tell a story since '96.  Vanilla Sky, far more flawed than Almost Famous, is very nearly about nothing at all. Every other scene talks about pop music, and every scene has two pop songs in it, yet the film is remarkably not about pop music.  Some may say it is about pop culture - okay then fine, what about pop culture?  It is vain?  I don't know how we can make this claim when clearly Crowe loves the album art of Freewheelin Bob Dylan and the film Jules et Jim, even though those narratives are what drive our protagonist David to his self-loathing suicide.  I just think he's a voyeur, a voyeur that wishes he was Tom Cruise and this is what we get out of his neurotic obsession with pop culture - this harrowing tale of confusion that is at times inspired and at other times haphazard - together with Sugga Ros and The Chemical Brothers and Jeff Buckley and Paul (stop now!) McCartney.  The film is jarring alarming, and poorly conceived in a very elaborate and richly designed way that is worth watching at least once.  It's fascinating how this man cannot tell a story."

","************SPOILERS********SPOILERS*********SPOILERS******************<br/><br/>
The movie: Big noisy, gaudy box. Empty inside. Hey, that's like the vain playboy/peacock David Aames. Mimics many other recent movies, but is as superficial as its protagonist. It's an uninteresting and dishonest puzzle that says nothing new. Style over substance.<br/><br/>The philosophy: ""The sweet isn't as sweet without the sour."" 4th grade Mediocrates.<br/><br/>It's only that David never experiences the sour except in a dream. The real sourness of life drove him to suicide. (At least one scenario within this movie mess.) The movie's whole love affair was in his dream/imagination. That aint love, unless you accept the dreams of a self-centered narcissist as real love. I know there's a big draw in the idea of a perfect romantic fantasy, but Sofia wasn't even a real person, but a creation of David's imagination: a nearly blank slate and puppet of his will, since it was all his dream. Sounds perfectly sweet to me. Where do I sign?<br/><br/>He's offered his face back and another chance in the distant future. Might not seem so fair to someone who hasn't had the bucks or technology to cure some handicap or disease. He sidesteps the hassle of having to form a persona that's not driven by a handsome face that opens doors and kills the ladies. Sounds really sweet to me. ""Look ma, no consequences!"" ""Money conquers all!""<br/><br/>""Happiness is found in the small things in life."" Erma Bombeck? Peking Express?<br/><br/>The only small things in this movie were the minds who conceived and executed their very small ambitions.<br/><br/>""Open your eyes."" anonymous<br/><br/>He never does in this movie. David needed a spiritual awakening but got an explanatory lecture. Glenda the Good Witch of Tech Support, with all that justifying on the rooftop, was a totally unconvincing proof of David's change. A soothing lecture is a lot cheaper to pull off than portraying real character development, isn't it? Having something preached at you is no substitute for learning, accepting and owning the Truth. Seems as though he was ready to take a leap and repeat it all again. Maybe he should have been asked to open his ears to hear that ""still small voice"" instead. But with Glenda droning and the soundtrack blaring I doubt he'd have heard that either.<br/><br/>""Maybe in another life, when we're cats."" That about says it all."

Kurt Russell as the father-figure/psychiatrist... and the music. The music supervisor on this is a genius. Radiohead, Todd Rundgren... perfect choices. The sheer lunacy of the ""tech support!"" scene. I love movies that ask big questions, and this one might ask the biggest of all.

Cameron Crowe said: ""We had Times Square to ourselves, which was an eerie, inspiring feeling,"" If you have ever lived in a city around or in New York City you know what this means.<br/><br/>This has always been one of my favorite movies and still is. My wife wanted to watch it again and I jump at the chance. I wrote this about Vanilla Sky on my Radmanart blog in 2017:<br/><br/>I was watching Vanilla Sky the other day and was moved again by this awesome movie. David to me resembles the scars of mistakes we make in life. This part gave me chills (edit): And what is any life; if not the pursuit of a dream The dream of peace the dream of achievement the dream of hearing someone say these words when they really, and truly mean them, I love you, Roam free Most of us live our whole lives without any real adventure; to call our own It's hard to comprehend; they laughed at Jules Verne too.<br/><br/>David offended Julianna Gianni selfishly and awfully. Isn't that the true scar's of David? David's life completely changes because of his disfigurement. Is that right? No it is not. One minute popular David the next shunned, even by his, one time, friends. Many uniquely, amazing people in our society are affected in this same way; without any visible scars. One minute a pinnacle of society, the next condemned by our fanatical political and religious beliefs. Very sad."

It really is a bittersweet film evoking a range of emotions and leaves me full of both joy and sadness in equal measures at its end. It really is a film that rewards re-watching to see the many layers and to help understand why there are so many 'theories' about what's going on other than what you see on the screen before you. I've never understood the hate this film gets, other than it's a 'Tom Cruise' film and the negativity that seems to engender. and I've recommended it many times to friends.

Penelope Cruz is wonderful as the shy, coy and mysterious love interest. <br/><br/>Throughout the whole movie, you wonder what is reality and what is not. When is David dreaming? When is he awake? Was he ever awake in the first place? If he wasn't awake then what was the point of this all - was this entire movie just a dream? <br/><br/>To put it bluntly - I don't know if I see any deep message hidden in the confines of this blur of reality.

","Is this perhaps one of the most underrated movies of all time? It seems most people just hated this movie. The simple explanation for this is that the nature of the movie is very dark and Director Crowe does a wonderful job of presenting an intellectual psychological masterpiece that just seems on first viewing to loose the average viewer.<br/><br/>Watch this movie a second time, sometimes even a third time and you will pick up on all those hidden little details, those delightfully subtle clues and even some of the not so subtle clues to understand what is happening.<br/><br/>On the second view you learn to appreciate the story of this movie which is a journey through the materialistic, egocentric condition that has been so linked to the American dream. On this journey first you see the superficial, the basic lusts and desires. Watch again you can see the deeper philosophical undertones (429 pop references, references to art, literature, classic cinema and music) that as the movie develops gain power to the point of literally destroying the superficial first perspective.<br/><br/>This movie plays with perceptions and layers, blends dreams and reality to such a point that we reach a critical point of confusion. Then as all good stories should; brings sense out of the chaos.<br/><br/>If you watched it once and hated it - but are a fan of psychological and philosophical works such as 'one flew over the cuckoos nest' 'Jean e jim' then give this a second chance. The second view is so much more rewarding!"
"crmang","10","2","4","3 June 2008"," One of the finest movies ever made that few know about
","If you are disenchanted with the movie industry these days for the lack of quality, you are not alone. If you want to see a relatively new movie that delivers on many levels, Vanilla Sky is a leading candidate. I will spare the details of the plot, but will give you a primer on how to appreciate this fine work of art to enhance your movie-watching experience. <br/><br/>To begin, the allusion to impressionistic art is not a coincidence. The art of impressionism embodies a whole set of socio-historical ideas that add depth to the movie. The beautiful ""Monet-like"" skies represents a disillusion with realism and an erasure of memory, evident in the visual display of distortion and haziness in many impressionist paintings. The scene in which these impressionistic skies appear reveal the emotional torment of the past as well as the desire to distort or rewrite it. This makes the main character's initial starting point as a wealthy playboy instead of a pauper essential in framing the movie's plot twist. <br/><br/>In addition to its crafty and artistic themes, the movie has a strong soundtrack that is both enjoyable and fun, but very appropriate for the scenes. Despite the lack of dynamic characters in this movie, with the main character being the only one although he too is rather static, the movie delivers a revelation that can only be appreciated with more than one viewing. It is through this second or third viewing that you pinpoint the scenes in which the main character has revelations about the nature of his reality and realizes whether or not he is dreaming. Through these scenes do you see his transformation. Simultaneously, through these scenes do you as the audience vicariously experience this change. <br/><br/>This movie is not about character development, it is about audience awareness of reality and fantasy. Will you be able to tell if a painting is impressionistic or a realistic landscape painting from afar? Probably not. Will you be able to discern a real scene from a dream in this movie without well-marked cues? It's unlikely. It is through careful analysis will one be able to determine the true nature of the scene, real or fantasy, and the depth of the audience's understanding alone will add depth (and appreciation) to this masterpiece. These visual cues will be revealed within the movie, but you will realize that your ability to distinguish between what's real and what's not is the driving force of the movie apart from the beautiful imagery and iconography. <br/><br/>The Great Gatsby was not considered to be a ""Great American Novel"" immediately after its release. It took a decade for the novel to be rediscovered and then catapulted into its deserving place today as an icon of American literature. I make no qualms about my desire to have this movie also be catapulted into its place among the greatest movies of all time as well. In the midst of the terribly banal climate of movies today, I hope my post will motivate some more attention for this great movie."

It is odd that I picked two movies that were made so recently, after the year two thousand, but I really think that film making has evolved lately. The good ones are either written in a way that you are more emotionally involved with the characters and plots. Like in Memento, you could actually feel what Guy Pierce's character was going through with his ""condition"". In Vanilla... and Eternal..., you could actually see their pain and the lengths they were going through to try to be with their lovers! Bottom line, Vanilla Sky is not your typical love story or 'chic flick' and if you have no imagination or aren't a hopeless romantic, then do not bother watching it.

The people at LE surly have not followed Sophia around to see where she ends up so they wouldn't know as i suspect that over x amount of years, rival companies to LE would have people in Cryo-state. I cant believe David didn't even ask that question before deciding to ""jump"".

","I'm going to put my feelings about the actors and actresses past aside. I am going to only critique them for this movie. For anyone who hasn't seen Abre Los Ojos (the original version) in its original language cannot understand how much this movie is lacking. Tom Cruise (whom is generally a pretty d*mn good actor) does a horrible job in this one. However, i think the only way to really see how bad he does is by comparing him to the actor from Abre Los Ojos. He had a much more realistic feel. I also like the setting form abre los ojos. The fact that penelope cruz was a mine in the other one instead of a dancer also helps a lot. It just makes more sense for a younger character to play this role. Tom Cruise was wayyy too old for this role and it really shows on the big screen. Besides the OKAY acting (bad acting by the best friend), the old actors, the setting, and the crappy remake. The worst part of the movie has to be how the Simpsons and conan obrien are present in the movie. It really takes away from the beauty of a movie. This is one of the biggest reason people tend to like foreign and indie films. It's a chance to get away from that crap that many cannot escape from their normal lives."

","It's always nice to see Hollywood embracing alternate and foreign cinema, but sometimes I really wish that would mean that foreign films would get a wider release and acceptance in the U.S. instead of American audiences receiving yet another sanitized version of a great film from another country. This is exactly how I see ""Vanilla Sky"" (a remake of the 1997 film ""Open Your Eyes"").<br/><br/>I must give Cameron Crowe credit for making a valiant effort at shooting such a seemingly unconventional piece, given his resume. In truth, unlike the psychological thriller that the story was previously, Crowe has made something far more romantic.<br/><br/>A love for the original piece is clear throughout much of the running time, as it hits each and every beat of that film, and he even uses some of the same camera angles. Oh, Mr. Crowe truly liked ""Open Your Eyes""! Unfortunately it seems that Tom Cruise wasn't willing to fall in love and give himself fully to his character. Both movies deal with a man who is disfigured in an accident. Why is it that in this sanitized version the injuries don't seem all that bad? I could stand to look at Cruise more than the character from the original, whose face was deformed on the border of recognition.<br/><br/>To top that off ""Vanilla Sky"" attempts to make sense of a very thought provoking premise. The last twenty minutes of the film are used up by explanations for the proceedings, even to the point of redundancy. Stop spoon feeding, Hollywood!"

","This movie shows you an unusual man, I'm sorry, an unusual main character, to some of you he must seem extraordinarily proverbial being that he is sincerely self-centered and artificial. The characters of this film are so beautifully played that I feel I do the actors and actresses an injustice by using the expression ""played"". This narcissistic a**hole (Cruise's character) is given a gift that few in human history have had or will ever discover, and rightly so he loses it altogether. That alone would make a riveting and poignant story, but this story has a remarkable and intellectual twist that has been hard-pressed into your face throughout the entire film. This film makes you laugh when it wants you to laugh and it makes you sad the moment you feel content. This film makes you want to feel cheerless and for that you are grateful. To have a few moments to maybe feel closer to a character or feel that you would have done it different, maybe better, maybe said ""no"" to Julia, maybe won Sophia after the accident. You might feel that you would never have been in the awkward situation of having an invidious lover that knows you have fallen for another. Just the fact that you suffer these emotions shows how affecting and powerful this film is. I, for one, feel that this film is more touching than the creators or actors can take acknowledgment for unaided. This film delivers you each human emotion in a measure that perhaps some cannot accept. From the undeniable love of a character to the discomfiture and trepidation of that same character only moments later. It spins you and tricks you and leads you on in a way that you cannot trust it, but this film can be trusted to explain everything if only you are capable of understanding. Not capable in an intellectual sense, but capable in an emotional sense. This film has an underlying sensation about it, something that you desire but at the same time something that you have told yourself to avoid all your years, like falling in love. I would give anything to have what Cruise's character had. The most powerful part of this film, for me, was in the elevator when 'Tech support' told Cruise's character about his own memorial when Sophia arrived crying. "".You were missed David..it was Sophia who never fully recovered; it was she who somehow knew you best, and like you she never forgot that one night when true love seemed possible.....consequences David..it's the little things."" ""The little things, there's nothing bigger is there?""<br/><br/>Shakespeare's 'Sweet sorrow' would never scratch the surface of the parting of David and Sophia on that rooftop. Pain, a vacuum of pain and emptiness on a level few can comprehend is more closely in sight of that moment. Knowing full well the real Sophia has been dead for over a century does not help our poor, transformed David. How can we as humans speak of powerful emotion without speaking of true love? What emotion is more powerful? What else is there, really?"
"gumbi555","10","2","4","13 November 2005"," Speaking to those who disliked this film...
","I really can't understand why people despise this movie. If you believe this film is ""terrible"" because it is far too confusing, pointless etc etc, then you ought to have analysed it further.<br/><br/>This movie is about life, with it's ups and it's downs. I'm sure most people can relate to having everything going for them one day and then it all crashes around them the next. Most people can probably also relate to wanting to run away from their problems with the help of something like a ""Lucid Dream"" to quote from the film.<br/><br/>It also raises the issue about how powerful the sub-conscious really is. Temporary derangement from trauma (like in the movie) or Stockholme Syndrome is a very dangerous thing.<br/><br/>Possibly the most important thing mentioned in the film is how huge the consequences of a single action can be. Just one miss-judged choice can lead to certain disaster.<br/><br/>So to all those who have seen this movie and didn't like it, see it again and bear the above comments in mind. This is a very special film that should be understood properly to get the full, and very important, meaning."

The beginning: ""open your eyes David""; The ending: ""open your eyes David"". Same voice (Julie). So was it all a dream or what part wasn't? Anyway, I'm not here to discuss that.. but rather the club scene... David is drunk (needed to get to get up the courage to ask).. approaches Sophia with .. well demands definition from her. He fell in love with her at first sight, but now he questions (and rightfully so) if Sophia will/could/does love him in his present state (disfigured). And what if his money had gone away too? Did she just ""love"" him for his stature? Did she even know him? And who said it was love anyway? It was just a feeling, no one actually said it. Was Sophia just not allowing true love to be desecrated by David's drunkeness? Forget if it was all a dream or not, are these not the questions presented in this scene? I ask this because I lost her the same way. Something I'll never know (?) for sure. Can a man ever be visibly needy and still be loved? ""I love you"" ""said"" she, but did she actually ""mean"" it? Harder for a man with means to grapple with? Or harder for a man lacking a nice jaw? What if lacking both? Then what's left?

"carter2","Null","2","4","16 June 2004"," Open Your Eyes, David
","I love this film. I own it and have seen it at least eight times. Every time I watch it, more and more of the small details make sense to me. Nevertheless, I've reached a point where I think I understand all that the movie has to offer, which is A lot, but I think that Cameron Crowe should have ironed out the script just a bit more. DO NOT READ FROM THIS POINT IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE - THIS IS A SPOILER.<br/><br/>So it's obvious that the one facet of the film that seems to mindf**k all of its viewers is the glitch in David's Lucid dream. This glitch is apparently caused by David's repressed guilt concerning Julie Gianni and the trouble that he knows he's brought to her life. My understanding is that while in his lucid dream, David desperately tries to suppress that guilt - or kill it - and this explains the ""beating"" of Julie Gianni. Along the lines of Freuds explanations of repression and sublimation, David's mind plays tricks on him: while he's trying to rid himself of the guilt over Julie Gianni - and in essence rid his mind of Julie herself - he is unable to do so because he finds that that guilt is interfering with his current life and love, Sofia - and it reveals itself in David's mind by substituting Sofia for Julie over and over. In the end he knows he killed somebody - metaphorically Julie, i.e. he destroyed her soul by refusing to commit to her - and then literally Julie bc of obvious reasons - but his guilt envelops his ability to distinguish between which of the women who love him.<br/><br/>So his mind is imprisoned because he knows he did something wrong - but he can't figure it out. This is the basis of the jail and Kurt Russell's character - to sort out his own mind over what happened. When he finally remembers that he entered a Lucid Dream and that his subconscious has been playing tricks on him - he calls tech support and there you have the rest of the end which is pretty much spelled out pretty well in the film.<br/><br/>But the problem I have is that 1) He should have somehow showed remorse for his neglect of Julie Gianni. He clearly felt guilty about it but in the end Crowe made his guilt seem pointless because he never rectified the situation - he merely redeclared his love for Sofia. If 'every waking moment is another chance to turn it all around', then I wish that they had showed some sort of remorse from David regarding Julie.<br/><br/>2) The glitch confused the s**t out of people. Having a sudden twist of plot in the form of resurfacing of repressed guilt is confusing if it is a) not explained right then and there b) never explained.<br/><br/>3) I don't get the ""This is a revolution of the mind"" bits. Why do people say that to him? Does it mean that the film is a revolution of the mind? Or the Lucid Dream product? What? Reminds me of Magnolia's bits of ""It really happened"" and Genesis references that they intersperse after the Frogs scene. That made sense, but Vanilla Sky's doesn't to me.<br/><br/>I noticed for the first time last night, however, that Julie Gianni says ""Open Your Eyes, David"" in the very last scene!! Ahh!! Does this mean that she did lucid dream as well? If he comes back 150 years into the future, how is it possible that SHE is saying Open your eyes??? Is this is mind again playing tricks? I want answers!<br/><br/>It took me more than 5 times to finally get a decent grasp on this movie. I like that, but I feel that Crowe could have made it a little better to understand the first time around. The prison scenes are so confusing that it's better to have it explicitly stated in the end that they weren't real so that the second time around you can watch it knowing that.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm just a bit slow, but I don't know if having to watch a movie 5 times to get it is a good thing or not."

","Vanilla Sky takes you on a ride that may look like other mind-benders like Mulholland Drive and Solaris, but this one tries to give you answers. The beginning may be slow, but soon you'll be on the ride of your life.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is David Aames, multimillionaire playboy. He inherited three magazines from his late father, and lives the high life. He's friends with Brian (Jason Lee) and keeps up a strictly play relationship with Julie Gianni (Cameron Diaz). Soon, however, Brian introduces Sofia (Penelope Cruz) to David, and Julie's upset, so what's to do? Drive off a bridge and kill herself, while just injuring David. His life, however, becomes a mix of reality and imagination, between dreams and actual happenings.<br/><br/>If you want a light, easygoing, crowd pleasing flick that gives you all the answers and wraps the ending in a nice little package with a bow and express ships it to your heart, don't look here. If, however, you want an intellectual film that's both straightforward and confusing, this is a good movie. From swift camera movements to perfect modern music, this movie has it all.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise (who, when in his mask and for a lot of the film, reminded me of Kevin Bacon in Hollow Man) did a good job of being a cocky millionaire who gets everything. Of course, to do that, he doesn't have to act much. Cruz, who starred in the original Abre Los Ojos, which this is a remake of, also worked well and had chemistry with Cruise. Diaz, although her part was small, did the best she could do, which was a lot. Kurt Russell, who plays a shrink, did a great job, too, but I wish he was billed before Diaz, because he had more screen time.<br/><br/>I really wish I had more to say about Vanilla Sky, but there isn't. I found myself liking this experience more each minute. It did start off slowly, but soon gained pace. I do wish, however, that I could more easily tell between David's dreams and reality. Besides that, it was a very good movie.<br/><br/>My rating: 8/10<br/><br/>Rated R for sexuality and strong language."

","""Vanilla Sky"" was another Tom Cruise exercise in narcissism.  In the movie he suffers the worse possible fate.  His pretty face is scarred.  I found the first half of this movie to be rather nauseating.   The main characters seem to be a mutual admiration society always telling each other how great they were.  There was a scene in Penélope Cruz's apartment where Tom Cruise looks at pictures on the refrigerator.  The pictures were all of Penélope Cruz.  I did a survey over the weekend of my family's refrigerator pictures and most were of other people or of them with other people.  My own refrigerator is covered with pictures of nieces and nephews.  I found this scene strange that a person puts their own pictures all over the refrigerator.  I wonder if the Hollywood types even caught this.  The second half of the movie was somewhat better in a Sci-fi sort of way.  I had a real hard time caring for the main actors though.  There was no empathy developed because of their self-centered, inward looking lives.  They seem to care for nothing but their own reflection.  If you are in love with the main actors as much as they are in love with themselves then see the movie.  If not miss it."
"FlickJunkie-2","9","2","4","23 August 2002"," A mind warping experience
","Cameron Crowe's dark remake of Alejandro Amenabar's 1997 Spanish film, `Abre los ojos' (also starring Penelope Cruz) is a mind warping experience. Welcome to a world where dreams and reality are seamlessly interwoven, so it is impossible for the characters, the viewers and maybe even Crowe to tell where one ends and the other begins.  This will be a frustrating film for anyone who hopes to make sense of it.  To enjoy it one must relax and allow oneself to be mentally flagellated for two plus hours.<br/><br/>Like all lady or tiger stories, the film will generate great debates among the intelligentsia about which parts of the story are real and which are the dreams.  However, for the majority the response will be, `Huh?'  Crowe keeps us guessing until the very last frame at which point he throws us the final curve and abruptly ends the film.  In the featurette that comes with the DVD, it is clear the Crowe is relishing his role as tantalizer, taking great pains to make each scene as ambiguous as possible to keep it open to multiple interpretations.  That's what makes the film fun, if you like that sort of thing.  Personally, I like closure, but I can appreciate Crowe's deliciously evil intentions.<br/><br/>As is always the case with Cameron Crowe, the presentation is innovative and visually interesting.  Crowe has a terrific and unique way of crafting his films that is very engaging.  In this film, he purposely avoids defining his characters, preferring to keep their motivations abstruse.  For him to maintain the vagueness, it is important that we remain confused about the characters' personalities.  In this regard, he succeeds spectacularly.  The film is a bit too long and bogs down slightly in the middle, but just when we are about to get bored, Crowe throws us another brain bender to keep it interesting.<br/><br/>Kudos go to the makeup department in the creation of Tom Cruise's facial disfigurement, which is realistically hideous and effective.<br/><br/>The acting ranges from good to great.  This is a particularly difficult film for actors since the characters are meant to remain indistinct.  It is hard to render a character when the director demands that his/her motivations and personality keep changing, but the cast adapts beautifully.  Tom Cruise is powerful and tortured as Aames, the convoluted protagonist.  Since the entire film is essentially shot from his perspective, it is important that we share his bewilderment and consternation, which means he must project those emotions onto us.  This he does with extraordinary effect, delivering a gut wrenching performance that takes him (and us) to the brink of insanity.  <br/><br/>Penelope Cruz is excellent as his sexy and supportive love interest.  But Cruz is eclipsed by Cameron Diaz, who steals the show with minimal screen time.  Diaz swings from sweet and adorable to vicious and maniacal with such ease that it is frightening.  Jason Lee is also good as Aames' fickle best friend and rival.  Lee naturally projects a trustworthy persona, so when he turns on Aames it creates the startling effect that Crowe wants.  Kurt Russell is okay as the psychologist, but this is a more cerebral role than his skills can handle.  Russell is a naturally visceral performer, great in roles as the tough guy with a big heart.  Here he seems a bit out of place.<br/><br/>This film is deviously crafted and expertly presented with deft performances by the cast.  It will drive most viewers a little nuts, which is its intention.  This will also mean that some people will really dislike it.  I rated it 9/10.  If you think you can figure it out, you're dreaming."

I never got to a point where I cared about any of the characters: Cruise was shallow, vain and selfish in both personnas; and the two women who revolved around him were completely uninteresting and predictable.

","I want to state clearly first of all that I am a fan of the darker side of film. Give me Se7en, Fight Club, A Clockwork Orange, Memento, and Vanilla Sky and I'll be happy forever.<br/><br/>With that said Vanilla Sky is the lightest movie I've ever seen.<br/><br/>
Stay with me, it'll make sense in the end.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise has been fleshing out lately to test the waters of what he can achieve. Some are very good, such as Jerry Maguire, some are very bad, such as Eyes Wide Shut. Vanilla Sky breaks the mold as he steps far far away from anything he's ever done before. Throughout the movie his character, David Aames, feels differently about HIMSELF (a big change for male characters in movies). He goes from feeling his life is great, to how his life is worthless, to being a nutcase, to being a fake since he was born. The way Crowe directs leads all of these together in a confusing mass, but in a good way. The film is supposed to toss your brain around as much as David's.<br/><br/>
I won't go into the story plot, too many people do that. What makes this a film you would hate to love is that it's getting such horrible reviews. It makes you almost ashamed to admit you even saw it. But what Crowe and Cruise (and Cruz come to think of it) are giving you in this film is a new era. This movie is not aimed at any specific group. I'd have to say if anyone it's aimed at teenagers who are sick of teeny bopper films and some generation X'ers. I remember watching Castaway and Lord of the Rings and seeing people stand and cheer either at the end or at impressive moments. I nearly applauded this film for it's fantastic direction and momentum. Castaway was too long and Lord of the Rings...well nothing from 2001 or 2002 will compare to it. But Vanilla Sky is a look at our society and especially the highly sexual male. It picks apart the things we all know and none of us want to say. Male's won't want to admit that David is a bad character for having one night stands even though we know it's true. Females won't want to look like rebellious types for saying he's a jerk when he's doing what all their male friends do anyway. It's a sad cycle that equals dismal ticket sales.<br/><br/>Do not be turned away though. If you want to see the best non-Lord of the Rings film for the next 12 months then go see Vanilla Sky. Do it now. You will not regret this if you're like me and hate teeny bopper films and see horrible holes in the plots of movies like Ali."
"RolloTomasi","4","2","4","27 December 2001"," A twist without a plot
","""Vanilla Sky"" is not an easy film to like, an art film disguised as an event film. I'd argue that a project like this is the sort of thing that SHOULD be what we consider an 'event,' because it's actually interesting. Whatever your opinion of this film is, it's worth a discussion.<br/><br/>
Being a star is about many things--recognizability, mystery, attraction, but probably most of all, trust.  That is, audiences feel 'safe' going to a Tom Cruise film--any Tom Cruise film. When will people ever learn? Consider three of Cruise's last four films, ""Magnolia,"" ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" and now ""Vanilla Sky."" None of the trio are exactly audience pleasers (personally, I hated ""Mission: Impossible 2""). They're odd, intricate pieces featuring odd, intricate characters. Like ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" ""Sky"" comes wrapped in a nice package. The former: Stanley Kubrick's last film and another pairing of wife Nicole Kidman; the latter: Camerons Crowe and Diaz, plus the (arguably) rising Penelope Cruz. With this kind of star power, many filmgoers willingly enter ""Sky"" knowing next to nothing about what they're in for. They're usually the first ones to hurl their super-size buckets of popcorn at the screen in anguish halfway through.<br/><br/>No popcorn became airborne at the screening I attended. There was, however, a couple near me who insisted on talking to each other through the entire second half of the movie. Normally this would annoy me a great deal. 'This better start making sense real fast,' the girl would say to her companion. He would try to explain what was going on perhaps not realizing we could hear every word of it. In this particular instance, I can't say I blame this girl, whoever she was. Personally, I've never asked myself 'what the heck is going on?' more in a film than I did during ""Vanilla Sky."" The only incentive to keep watching was Cruise, who gives one of his best performances. As for the story, all is revealed eventually, but it takes a major test of patience to get there. <br/><br/>This is the point for me where having seen Alejandro Amenabar's ""Open Your Eyes"" would have been helpful, but I'll do my best. Having seen his really, really great film ""The Others,"" however, will do for now. It provides the example I need to illustrate my point. ""Others"" is recognizable as a ghost story and makes sense, whether you know what's REALLY going on or not. You understand the themes that are being presented. Depending on how observant you are, you may even be able to predict the ending before Amenabar pulls the rug out from under you.  <br/><br/>Based on Amanabar's own criteria, ""Vanilla Sky"" stinks. People watch movies to be entertained, to see a story, for two hours give or take. They don't go to have nonsense hurled at them for two hours and then have that nonsense explained to them for the last fifteen minutes in a bunch of exposition by talking heads. There's no rug to pull out because Crowe forgets to even put one under you. The only possibility of enjoying this would be on a second viewing. That should never be the case. Of course, next I'll actually see the film ""Sky"" is based on, which supposedly is all but a carbon copy of it, and I like it. No matter how similar the two films are, they are still two different films, made in different countries by different directors, with different actors (except Cruz). <br/><br/>Wanting to make an avant-garde, thinking piece is noble, but Crowe, who had always been reliable, bricks this one.  File ""Vanilla Sky"" under interesting,' fascinating,' ambitious,' but not good.'<br/><br/>

","""Vanilla Sky"" is a Mystery - Romance movie in which we watch a very famous and privileged man getting onto a car accident with a lover of his. From that point everything will change for him and he will have to deal with some new situations.<br/><br/>I found this movie very interesting because the mystery never faded out and continued through the whole duration of the film. The interpretations of Tom Cruise who played as David Aames, Cameron Diaz who played as Julie Gianni and Penélope Cruz who played as Sofia Serrano were very good and the combination of all those actors made this amazing result. The direction which was made by Cameron Crowe was very good and he presented very well the stories of his main characters while the mystery behind some aspects continued. To sum up, I have to say that I recommend everyone to watch this movie because I am sure that you will find not just another interesting movie but a mind-blowing one."

Everything in the movie, the storyline, the drama, acting, music makes every second absolutely enjoyable and wholesome.

","Think it all the way through, and Cameron Crowe's ""Vanilla Sky"" is a scrupulously moral picture. It tells the story of a man who has just about everything, thinks he can have it all, is given a means to have whatever he wants, and loses it because--well, maybe because he has a conscience. Or maybe not. Maybe just because life sucks. Or maybe he only thinks it does. This is the kind of movie you don't want to analyze until you've seen it two times.<br/><br/>I've seen it two times. I went to a second screening because after the first screening I thought I knew what had happened, but was nagged by the idea that certain things might not have happened the way I thought they had. Now that I've seen it twice, I think I understand it, or maybe not. Certainly it's entertaining as it rolls along, and there is wonderful chemistry of two quite different kinds between Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz on the one hand, and Cruise and Penelope Cruz on the other.<br/><br/>""Vanilla Sky,"" like the 2001 pictures ""Memento"" and ""Mulholland Drive"" before it, requires the audience to do some heavy lifting. It has one of those plots that doubles back on itself like an Escher staircase. You get along splendidly one step at a time, but when you get to the top floor you find yourself on the bottom landing. If it's any consolation, its hero is as baffled as we are; it's not that he has memory loss, like the hero of ""Memento,"" but that in a certain sense he may have no real memory at all.<br/><br/>Cruise stars as David Aames, a 33-year-old tycoon who inherited a publishing empire when his parents were killed in a car crash. His condo is like the Sharper Image catalog died and went to heaven. He has a sex buddy named Julie (Cameron Diaz) and thinks they can sleep together and remain just friends, but as she eventually has to explain, ""When you sleep with someone, your body makes a promise whether you do or not."" At a party, he locks eyes with Sofia Serrano (Penelope Cruz), who arrives as the date of his friend Brian (Jason Lee) but ends up spending the night with him. Even though they don't have sex, it looks to me like their bodies are making promises to each other.<br/><br/>At this point the movie starts unveiling surprises which I should not reveal. A lot of surprises. Surprises on top of surprises. The movie is about these surprises, however, and so I must either end this review right now, or reveal some of them.<br/><br/>THE END.<br/><br/>OK, for those of us still in the room, and without revealing too much: Julie drives up just as David is leaving after his night with Sofia, offers him a lift, drives off a bridge in Central Park, kills herself, and lands him in front of ""the best plastic surgeon in New York"" with a horribly scarred face. This time thread is intercut with another one in which a psychiatrist (Kurt Russell) is interrogating him about a murder. He insists there was no murder. Maybe there was and maybe there wasn't, and maybe the victim was who we think it is, and maybe not.<br/><br/>""Vanilla Sky"" has started as if it is about David's life and loves. It reveals an entirely different orientation (which I will not reveal even here in the room), and, to be fair, there is a full explanation. The only problem with the explanation is that it explains the mechanism of our confusion, rather than telling us for sure what actually happened.<br/><br/>That's why I went to see it a second time. In general, my second viewing was greatly helped by my first, and I was able to understand events more clearly. But there was one puzzling detail. At the second viewing, I noticed that the first words in the movie (""open your eyes"") are unmistakably said in the voice of Sofia, the Penelope Cruz character. If the movie's explanation of this voice is correct, at that point in the movie David has not met Sofia, or heard her voice.<br/><br/>How can we account for her voice appearing before she does? There is a character in the movie who refers to a ""splice."" We are told where the splice takes place. But consider the source of this information--not the person supplying it, but the underlying source. Is the information reliable? Or does the splice take place, so to speak, before the movie begins? And in that case ... but see the movie and ask the question for yourself.<br/><br/>Note: Early in the film, there's an astonishing shot of Tom Cruise absolutely alone in Times Square. You might assume, as I did, that computers were involved. Cameron Crowe told me the scene is not faked; the film got city permission to block off Times Square for three hours early on a Sunday morning. Just outside of camera range there are cops and barricades to hold back the traffic.<br/><br/>S."

Had I watched this one before the original I might have rated it higher, and I know it's not quite fair to this one to rate it based on another movie, but as it is such a close copy, that is were I stand now. Vanilla Sky does win points for better describing the main characters company problems, but loses points over all for not feeling quite as emotional as the original.

Truth is Tom Cruise is an amazing actor and Penelope Cruz is an amazing actor as well, but this movie still manages to fall under the radar.

"amanmishra868","8","0","0","26 January 2018"," A must watch Psychological thriller
","Vanilla Sky is an American Psychological thriller movie released back in 2001. The story of the movie revolves around and is focused on the life of David Ames played by Tom Cruise who is inherits his father's wealth. One day at his party he is introduced by his friend to Sofia Serrano with whom David falls in love with at first sight but at the same time he is avoiding Julie Gianni who supposedly has a thing for david because of their shared past together. Following some incidents the next day, David and Julie together meet an car accident which mutilates his face and after waking up up from comma he discovers that Julie died in that car accident. All of this is story told by David to his Psychologist in Jail where he is convicted for Julie's death. David has trouble remembering the incidents of the past and various incidents from different time period and with him we are set on a quest on finding out the reason why Julie died.<br/><br/>Vanilla sky was an absolute treat an individual who enjoys cinema and whose favourite genre is psychological thriller. However movie does lack in a little visual department as movie could have been a little bit more dramatic with darker tone as everything just appears so normal that the viewer might forget he actually is watching a movie. As story progresses a lot of twists happen which can throw audience wondering and shocked. Unlike many other psychological thriller there is always one maniac with their own ideology and thoughts but David as a protagonist discovers his own different identity due to memory loss. Many memories of david are changed or replaced by himself for which movie hints multiple times at human's subconscious and how dangerous it is.
Acting in the movie is something that has to mention as Tom Cruise totally nails it as an guy with disfigured face.<br/><br/><br/><br/>For some reason the first part of the movie is great but later for which david is having remembering issue is addressed very poorly as movie completely changes its tone from Mystery psychological thriller to this Science fiction setting and such transition will obviously not be appreciated by most of the audience however i liked it but people won't because it was not executed properly and most of the time went in establishing character of david in 1st half of the movie itself.
Vanilla sky in the end becomes one of those movies which had great and unique concept for which it is expressed very nicely but later half brings it down and for that reason the next time someone asks me to suggest them an psychological thriller movie, I won't definitely suggest them Vanilla Sky and the reason is that because I love this movie for what it is no matter how much I criticize it and if someone else complains about it, I won't be able to take that. The ending is of movie is totally like many great films where you are given answers and are left to wonder and imagine story according to yourself. And yes I do recommend it."
"bowmanblue","8","0","0","22 January 2018"," More 'Lynchian' than love
","It's hard to imagine that in 2001 a love story starring Tom Cruise, Cameron Diaz and Penelope Cruz was actually considered a Box Office failure. But then that's because it wasn't a love story. However, much of the marketing that surrounded it concentrated on the 'relationship aspect' of the film, lulling people into thinking this was what they would be getting. Therefore, by the time they had left the cinema and their heads had stopped spinning, they possibly were among the many who simply described 'Vanilla Sky' as a 'mess.' Yes, the story is centres around a print billionaire (Tom Cruise's) slowly falling in love with a struggling artist (Penelope Cruz) while at the same time trying to fend off his existing lover (Cameron Diaz). So far, nothing particularly out of the ordinary. However, once the film gets going (and I say this referring to much that comes in the second half, as the first half sets everything up without giving too much away as to what's about to come) things start taking a turn for the weird.<br/><br/>Dreams are mentioned more than once and that's a good analogy as to how the film progresses. Things happens that appear a little random, leaving the audience to wonder whether there may ever be some form of supernatural influence involved. The story chops and changes and deliberately leaves the viewer feeling pretty disorientated, much like you'd feel upon waking up from a particularly vivid dream. Naturally, this form of story-telling doesn't make for an easy ride when it comes to understanding the narrative. I can see it leaving some people a little confused (it took me a couple of watches to actually 'get' the film entirely!).<br/><br/>I mentioned 'Lynchian' in my title. This refers to film-maker David Lynch, who's famous for his weird, surreal, completely NON classic Hollywood narrative way of telling a story. He, like 'Vanilla Sky,' likes to leave a fair element of the story up to the viewers' interpretation, rather than spoon-feeding them every plot point. Therefore, this is most likely a film that you're going to find yourself discussing with friends after a viewing (although, in my opinion, 'Vanilla Sky' actually gives you a lot more answers than the average David Lynch film!).<br/><br/>If you know what you're in for I think people who are in the mood for a particularly weird and slightly disturbing type of film will quite enjoy this. You definitely have to be in the mood. I've seen it a fair few times, but, if I'm simply craving car chases and shoot-outs, then this isn't the film I put on. I think if anything sums it up best it's Cameron Diaz's performance in 'Vanilla Sky' - on the surface, sweet and frothy. However, dig deep and you'll find dark and creepy (and that's not an insult - she's really good in this!)."

"Fred-S","7","0","0","7 August 2009"," Not Nearly As Good As Open Your Eyes
","I saw Vanilla Sky when it was first released in 2001 and then again on DVD about a month ago. In reading reviews on IMDb I discovered that it was a remake of a Spanish movie, Open You Eyes, and so I ordered it from Netflix as well. Penelope Cruz is the only cast member in both versions. She plays the role of Sofia and does a masterful job. The story is almost exactly the same scene by scene and even in dialogue. <br/><br/>But, the ALMOST is significant. <br/><br/>When I saw Vanilla Sky, I thought it was pretty good. I did think that it left too much unresolved and an extra scene (which I didn't know was extra at the time), further clouded the resolution with no apparent value to the movie. <br/><br/>Ambiguity isn't always bad in a story, but I felt that the resolution in Open Your Eyes was exactly what was appropriate for the movie. I also felt that the scenery-chewing that Tom Cruise did in several scenes of the American version actually detracted from the feel of the story line.<br/><br/>There is a bar scene that is almost identical, word for word, in the two films. The only difference is the tone and body language of the main character and the bartender, which makes the Vanilla Sky version quite confrontational while in the Spanish version the scene plays as a simple faux pas on the part of the bartender that is quickly resolved. Again, I thought the confrontation was unnecessary and, I would hope, unrealistic.<br/><br/>In general, I think the American version suffers from inferior direction and poorer acting. Penelope Cruz is excellent in both. Cruise and Kurt Russell seem to have decided that their roles needed to big bigger and more emotional. They were wrong.<br/><br/>If you are really interested in film making, I suggest you watch both and see how seemingly small changes can change the ""feel"" of a movie. Otherwise, I recommend Open Your Eyes."

","How can i start to convey the absolute truth about how unbelievably unforgettable this movie is. The writing, screenplay, dialogue and the beautiful cinematography where outstanding, but what really dazzled me was the extreme acting skill that was sieved out by the always excellent Cameron Crowe. I am not going to give away major spoilers, because i think this movie needs to be watched, as it is the only way to understand what was going on. I will give you a premise and a little to how each character contributes to the story.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise plays a rich kid playboy who is living the dream. He has sex with Cameron Diaz whenever he wants to but has no intention of having relationship with her. Jason Lee plays his BF and employee. In walks Penelope Cruz who quickly absorbs Cruz with those puppy dog eyes that she does so well. After spending one night together, they part with the intention of nourishes their flourishing friendship. As he leaves her apartment that is when the story unfolds. And that is all I'm saying.<br/><br/>Cruise brings his character to life, where you understand exactly what type of personality he is. A sincere man with money as a distraction. Although rich kids who have inherited fortunes as opposed to achieving it, already loses the character some points with the viewership but he played the role so well that he doesn't even drift to the side of irritation. As the events transpire we are swept away on a journey through David Aimes mind. The dream state and reality sweep so comfortably in and out of each other that at one point you don't know what or who to believe, which means we are now experiencing the exact emotions of the main character. A dream in a dream in a dream. You start wondering, ""ok, maybe now we're fine, we're back to earth and then you realize we are deeper now than ever before. The plot is tight and the ending delivers answers to all questions asked in the 2hrs preceding. Penelope Cruz was so ""the girl next door"", the one you'd take home to mum. We feel her love for him, or rather what he wished her love to be, I'm still debating that one with myself.<br/><br/>You walk away from this glad yet sad, with a sense of victory but failure as well. These terms might be contradictory, but that is what this movie does, it makes sense of the non-sensical. I suggest this movie to everyone who likes excellent movies."

","It is a good film, with many people being negative, and many more guessing wildly at its meaning. I think the film is complex, but less so than many people are suggesting.<br/><br/>When DA signs up for the Lucid Dream, he chooses the point at which he begins the dream, and this occurs outside the nightclub. Before that part, there is no dream-sequence apart from a couple of short bits at the beginning.<br/><br/>As for being cryogenically frozen - well, DA is frozen once he commits suicide. He does not go into the dream state when he is frozen. He has to wait until the technology is developed (this is stated in the film). Once the technology is developed to bring humans back from a frozen/dead state (re. the small dog on the TV) - DA can be brought back to life - but, crucially - he can either be brought to life and woken up, or he can go into a Lucid Dream of his choice (which he signed up for before committing suicide), which is what DA chooses to do - the start point of his dream being the scene outside of the nightclub.<br/><br/>The problem is that there is a nightmare element to his dream, as he committed suicide and is convinced that he 'killed someone' - (himself) - but gets confused as he tries to figure out who he killed.<br/><br/>The scenes with Kurt Russel where DA is wearing the mask is certainly part of his dream - he is self-analysing to try and find out what happened (which is haunting him).<br/><br/>He makes the decision to wake up to the real world (which is 200 years since he was frozen - stated in the film by the Tech Guy), and jumps off the building in order to wake himself up from the Lucid Dream, which is the way he wanted to be woken up, and the way he chose to wake up when he signed up for the Lucid Dream (also stated in the film).<br/><br/>This is a great film, and worth watching more than once (if not just to understand it) but is visually rich, and yes, Tom Cruise (of whom I am not a great fan) does act well - he is, as yet, no great master of the art, but executes a compelling performance.

Hogwash, BS, a carbon copy of Amenabar's original, Crowes Magnum Opus. Many viewers found that the ending was somewhat juvenile insomuch as the first rule of creative writing being ""don't' end the story with it was all a dream"". Still, I freaking' love this film! Not because of the ending, In fact I find the ending a little annoying to be perfectly honest. As Chuck Klosterman wrote in Sex, Drugs and Cocoa Puffs the choice made by Cruise/Ames at the end of the film merely shows a desire for 'integrity' as opposed to happiness per se.<br/><br/>What truly dragged me into the film was the way the emotions were expressed by the characters. the use of dialogue in this film is phenomenal and is by far Crusie's best execution of dialogue. (How the man can say 'Like shards of metal slicing my every thought' in reference to a series of headaches whilst maintaining NO sense of irony is bordering on the astonishing. Also Diaz's use of the word C** is incredibly jarring and helps to almost shake the viewer into realising either the depth of her feeling for Ames or the level of her mental instability.<br/><br/>Anyways, not so much of a review as brief comment. please don't be too harsh.

But his life is taking a big turn when he met with a car accident. Unfortunately he got terrible defects on his face and suddenly his life is more less destroyed.<br/><br/>My summary is that if you like movies that are intellectual, frustrating and have unexpected endings you must see this one."

","This one is everything Eyes Wide Shut is not. Why, oh why, couldn't this of been Kubrick's last film? I think the bottom line is that for TC to be in a good role, he has to get his face bashed in. Maybe it was Kidman holding him down, but there's an outside chance that TC may actually be able to act. This is an order of magnitude better than any other role that TC has had.<br/><br/>There are a few slips with the direction, but to fair, the storyline is just a bit more complex than ""A good looking guy gets a job in a bar and gets laid"" The biggest issue for me was the soundtrack at times was too intrusive into the storyline for me. As for the ending, well, you'd have to make a pretty good case to me in order to dump Penelope Cruz as my girlfriend. Only Tom Cruise could be having sex with PC who then turns into an orgasmic Cameron Diaz and think he's having a nightmare. The only way it could get better would be if she turned into a six-pack of beer and a pizza afterward. Or to have both at the same time, but I digress..."

Ever since I saw this movie in previews i always thought it looked interesting, and sure enough it was. Amazing directing and acting, a little bit too long i must say, they could have cut down the script by about a half hour(it seemed a little bit delayed in certain scenes in terms of action), but amazing script. Truly laden with Jungian imagery such as the lucid dreaming, and the masks representing the lack of identity. Movies like this are why i watch them in the first place. I'll count this one in the annals of such greats as mulholland dr. or lost highway, or donnie darko(different yet still the same in terms of depth).

","This is one of the five or ten decent movies made in 2001. My main argument in favor of this opinion is the film's originality. It's screenplay was not vomited from a Hollywood formula. I heard that  Vanilla Sky is a poor remake of a foreign film, but that's much better than a formulaic film. MOST Americans have little interest in foreign films so maybe this could spark a small interest in a few.<br/><br/>I won't give a plot summary (I find them superfluous), but will say the movie contains competent acting and decent dialogue (although cheesy at times). I've heard some say the movie was confusing and incoherent but I disagree. However, it does require more attention than most movies that oh say Tom Cruise is in. He is great in this movie (even though he manages to sneak in his patented overacted, seizure-like, fantastic smiling fits). He was only better in Eyes Wide Shut (in which he refrained from said fits-no doubt ordered by Kubrick).<br/><br/>Take it from Dallas babe and go and see the movie.

To say that you need an open mind to understand this film would be an understatement, however I found the storyline refreshing as it always kept you guessing as to what may be real and what was just in the mind. Tom Cruise plays an excellent role as the play boy gone wrong! He pays for the errors of his ways but inside there is the romantic, needy man which keeps him going. Cameron Diaz shines in her psychotic role and Penelope Cruz, taking to one side her 'annoying' accent, makes the film captivating as the 'one'.

In fact, I hadn't watched it since and forgot how absolutely perfect everything seemed to be. The dialogue, the cinematography, the casting.<br/><br/>Of course, in the theatre, after being absolutely blown away for 4/5ths of the film (which had reached a fever pitch with the smothering of the truelovestalker) I found the ending was a real let down. It appeared to come out of nowhere and serve no other purposed other than to throw the first 4/5ths of the film back in your face. The old ploy: ""Oh. It was all a dream"". Whatever.<br/><br/>Well, I watched it again last night, for the first time. Yeah. The ending ties up all the loose ends. Accurately, correctly, and properly. I missed it the first time because I was too busy being dumbfounded at the relationships and the dialogue to realize that things weren't quite normal in David's world. When things started unraveling in the second act, I thought he was a psychological mess. Then I saw all the clues re: LE, etc. But I still didn't appreciate that seemingly anti-climactic ending.<br/><br/>Well, first impressions aren't always right. The ending wasn't anti-climactic. It was more unexpected. And, because of that, difficult to absorb on that first viewing. Anyway, if you've only seen it once, and weren't quite sure what to think, watch it again.

This movie is philosophy! It is Crows philosophy on dreams. How can we really know if we are dreaming or not, what represents a dream? Vanilla Sky is Crows way of trying answering that question, I believe. I've seen that a lot of people here have written that they do not understand it, nothing is in relation to anything in the movie, the end is completely not understandable. But that is kind of the point, because we cannot know the answer to the question I wrote earlier, that's philosophy! At least this is what I believe.

In the beginning, this seems to be pretty accurate: romantic, oh yeah! You can feel the tension between the Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz... great. The viewer is expected to fall in love with her, and you really do (If I was a woman I'd fancy Tom, I guess)...well, something like that, you know. What happens after the carcrash, when David Aames life takes a turn he looses control over, is unbelievable after the quite romantic start! But its definately GREAT! This way you can really feel the characters... its not just some folks in a strange situation, they come alive...more. Great acting, great story, great REMAKE! It's a remake of 'Abre Les Ojos' ('open your eyes', you'll get along this phrase quite a lot of times watching the movie, so be prepared, for what that might mean...I don't know).

","Apart from a few minutes of pure jealousy induced hatred when Tom Cruise was trying to blow away Cameron Diaz in favour of Penelope Cruz (what a choice!)

The plot gets better on a second or third viewing - if you're as thick as I am and get confused easily. I just love the whole concept of cryogenics and the issues it raises and I thought this film brought many of those issues out in a fascinating way.<br/><br/>I don't normally find much interesting in Tom Cruise's usual action-packed hero/rich business kid roles but somehow I warmed to him this time. Perhaps it was seeing him get his face smashed in and having to cope with being plain ugly for a change that made him seem a bit more appealing. Then again, in the story his millions left him immortal and living in a dream world with Penelope Cruz for eternity. Not a bad future for anyone, except that for Cruise even that wasn't good enough! In films, as I suspect in real life, he always seems to get an obscene amount of 'the sweet' without ever having to take very much of 'the sour'. No, damn it, I hate him! ...

"vladymirror","Null","0","0","29 June 2003"," My first movie
","What is a good movie? How do you define which movie is good and which one's bad? Let's elaborate over this matter. I think this issue has three sides.<br/><br/>1. The first one has to do with the person himself. His character, mentality, education if you want; in few words: one's background, the way one was brought up and educated - the determinants of one's value system.<br/><br/>2. The second one a believe has to do with the current emotional state of the moviegoer at the time of seeing the particular movie. Is he in love or brokenhearted, employed or unemployed, happy or sad; how his day, month, year or last few years were like. Why is he going to see the particular movie: because of the story, actors, director, etc. What is he going to do after the movie? To say: what's in his mind as he enters the movie theatre in terms of current mood, feelings, thoughts.<br/><br/>3. The third one surely has to do with the quality of the movie. Even though people have different tastes, there are certain criteria that make the evaluation possible. The most important being-whether we like it or not-the amount of money a movie makes as well as the different movie awards.<br/><br/>And the outcome of the above is How does this say 2h fantasy  leave you (fantasy because that what movie making is all about - selling dreams). So How did this dream fit into the three: Was it a good dream something you have experienced and wish you hadn't or it is a completely different kind of dream that you haven't thought about. Is it a dream that you gonna remember for years to come or one that you gonna forget the very next day. And so on and so on.<br/><br/>But again How do you define a good movie? I guess there isn't a single answer to that question. It's like life itself: to different people means different things.<br/><br/>You may ask: What was the purpose of all this waste of ink so far but that was the question I asked myself after watching the movie ""Vanilla sky"" - was it a good movie. Does the fact that I couldn't sleep for days or that I still keep thinking about the whole story after one year already makes a good movie out of it. It is not that I liked or did not like the movie it is just the first movie that hit my threes (background, current condition and movie criteria) with power - for good or bad it will stay with me forever."

","I just watched this movie for the second time.  A little slow, a little foggy at times, but overall, decent script, some good acting, and some thought provoking material.  I thought Kurt Russell's supporting performance was excellent.  Very different role for him.  He is particularly funny in the rooftop scene.  Tom Cruise plays two different people in this movie. Prior to the accident, he's a less humorous version of Jerry Maguire. After the accident, his character, along with the story, is more complex, darker. The makeup job for the ""scary"" version of him was well done.  Cruise does something in his acting that is hard to describe.  His performances are not great in the sense that you immerse yourself in his character and forget the actor (ala Edward Norton).  But at the same time, some of the nuances in his performance are so good that you still admire the overall performance. He's like a classic stage actor that exagerates a bit too much, but there is something interesting about the way he does it, so you still enjoy the performance.  Cameron Diaz doesn't add much to the film until the car ride, where she gets pretty scary.  Penelope Cruz, well, I'm not crazy about her acting, but she does a passable job.  Jason Lee is good as the best friend.<br/><br/>You have to listen to this movie closely.  There is a lot of dialogue to sift through, but if you have the patience, there are a lot of meaningful lines that underscore the movie's moral lessons.  The music does as well."

If it had been at any time other than just on the heels of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman's highly public split, there might not have been such a huge holocaust against two of the three main stars of the movie.<br/><br/>Essentially, this is a dream-like version of The Matrix. The same themes - that of reality and its fragility, identity and the power of perception - are covered, but they are given far more than the superficial treatment that The Wachowski Brothers gave them in The Matrix.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise plays David Aames, a person whose life seems to have spiraled downhill since a car accident involving his lover, Julie (given a bit of an edge by Cameron Diaz). It's difficult to sum up the plot of the movie, and what I've just said sounds overly simplistic, but watching the movie yourself will give you a chance to really follow things.<br/><br/>As the movie descends into a more and more dream-like state, it becomes increasingly apparent that David's world - which is actually a sort of induced dream in itself - has been affected by his own perceptions, subconscious fears and feelings.<br/><br/>While the plot is occasionally difficult to follow, Cameron Crowe has delivered a highly original movie that stresses the control of our own subconscious over how we take in the world. The dream sequences are particularly interesting to watch, and the movie definitely requires a second viewing to take everything in.<br/><br/>Try it.

This whole scenario for me was probably the most emotionally-driven some say that Julie was crazy, and she was to a certain extent, but i cant help but feeling her anger over her lovers indecison to commit to a relationship, I mean julie really loved David, it was almost like Romeo & Juliet or  Ethan Frome, This movie also reminded me of ""The Picture of Dorian Grey"" in many facets of the movie. But sadly, David is really in love with this other girl he just met whose name is Sofia and Julie gets jealous and tries to commit a double murder. The whole movie is extremely intriguing and explores the depths of the mind of David Aames and the state of mind he really is in. Overall a very artistic movie with one hell of a conclusion, It is basically a mans quest for identity and love which isnt actually real. I recommend drama and sci-fi entusiasts to watch it.

"ixtlan","Null","0","0","11 April 2003"," Mostly Misses The Mark - But The Film Was Oddly Compelling To Me
","(Warning: Some Spoilers)<br/><br/>I do not think that this movie accomplished the filmmaker's goal. The whole mystery unraveled in a rather melodramatic and pedantic way at the end. It was bad science fiction (but not as bad as ""Return of the Clones""). It is as though the filmmaker thought it was unthinkable for the audience to be left with the impression that the character David Aames (played by Tom Cruise) could possibly have murdered his lover. The movie might have had a lot more impact if the question of what was real and what was dream had been left ambiguous. Tom Cruise had some fine acting moments in the film, but in many ways he merely reprised the emotional outbursts that were so fine in ""Fourth of July"".<br/><br/>The movie seems to be about a life reformed. I think this is is one of the film's main messages. Witness when the character Sofia says to David during the evening they spend together: ""Every passing moment is another chance to turn it all around."" But David Aames never does take advantage of that opportunity. His life, a loveless one, essentially ends the next morning. The movie also seems to be about a perfect love realized. But this is only on the surface. It is actually about a love never realized yet acted out in someone's fantasy anyway.<br/><br/>In his fantasy Sofia tells him that he never should have gotten in that car with Julia, his stalker, that fateful morning. That is the opportunity he missed to turn it all around - to resist the temptation to join Julia. Instead he could have moved forward in a reformed way instead of giving way to vanity. The character of Julia, is, I imagine, supposed to represent a mirror to his vanity and the selfish lovelessness of his life.<br/><br/>The movie revolves around one sexually charged but unconsummated night with the only woman one man will ever truely love and the chase to capture and hold the fantasy of that love, which remains unfulfilled. But it is about hope too. When David Aames confronts Sofia in the club and implores her to share her thoughts and feelings about their relationship, she, in my opinion, tortured but compassionately replies, ""No I can't. I will tell you about it in another life...when we are both cats."" This is the great hope of the movie - that somehow their love transcends this life (or this fantasy). In some way true love never dies and will manifest itself in an afterlife and beyond."

Check out the scene with tom cruise and noah taylor in the bar. It's perfectly executed. And the finale is positively poetic. Beautiful infact. Everyone here makes an impression. Penelope Cruz i thought did extremely well in a soft role, and tom cruise once again shows us that he can infact act his socks off if he wants to. It's brain numbing, head scratching, wonderfully surreal, disturbing, horrific, romantic, poetic, arty, everything really. Oh and not to forget that is has possibly the best soundtrack ever put on film. Sigur ros, icelands premier band make the ending with it's glorious track 4."

","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** I watched this movie and I have to say that is is unique. First of all I liked the story. David is a very handsome rich young man who has good job, nice girlfriend and much money. He is happy and very confident in himself. His past victories, relations with women, success at work and recognition of people around makes him feel himself a hero. During the whole day. But not at nights when he is alone, hurt, scared and helpless. His life becomes just happier when he finally meets the woman of his life Sofia. But suddenly all his nightmares become his reality. He after car accident is totally disfigured. He is hurt a lot both inside and outside. He tries to come back to normal life, he even meets Sofia but he fails. His doctors can't help him for reconstructive surgery is still not so much advanced in his case. He understands that his life will never be normal again and he finds himself on the road of life crushed, unhappy and alone. This is the turning point of his life: to go back to cruel reality and try to survive or to start a new life but only in his dreams. He continues his life and meets someone in Internet who gives him a chance to change his life. The program LE exists for those who can't be treated or helped in any other known ways. David agrees and chooses the turning point the moment when he was lying on the road. From now on he lives only in his new world - his dreams. There he is restored completely in his body and in his relations with Sofia. He is happy, loved and nice again. But this world of dreams starts to crash because of his nightmares. Then he understands that he lives far away from reality and stops the LE program in his life. But how to go back to reality from which he had escaped? He has to do something he is scared of. He is scared of his reality and he comes back in it by jumping from a skyscraper (he was scared of height the most)He opens his eyes coming back to his reality. So often we can be scared of our reality so we start to live in our dreams escaping into our own world where we feel ourselves confident. So often our dreams never come to pass. We need to find within us power to face reality which can be so cruel and painful for us. We must make a jump from our unreal world where we deceive only one person - OURSELVES. Our dreams should never be our deception but our inner power for life.<br/><br/>God bless!"

","And isn't that the best type of story? I've watched this movie with about 20 different people and it's very interesting to hear all the different theories. It helps to see it at least a couple of times to absorb it all in and now in hindsight, I feel as I did at first that the film lacks a bit of warmth, except for the scenes between Cruise and Cruz, who have got beautiful chemistry, and the film will seem very dated in about 10, 15 years time, especially the horrendously long disco scene, but this movie will go down as one of Tom Cruise's best. And there are some remarkable scenes thanks to Cameron Crowe's directorial skill, notably the first nightmare scene that was actually filmed in a blocked-off Times Square at 5 o'clock on a Sunday morning, and the heartbreakingly sad scene when Tom is drunkenly chasing after his friend Brian on a nightime New York street knowing (imagining?) he's in his dream woman's arms.<br/><br/>Another great bit of acting by Penelope Cruz when she removes David's mask and the suspense is great and Penny is right on the money.<br/><br/>If a film has to have at least 5 great scenes in order to be any good then this movie has that in spades.<br/><br/>

","Maybe I watch too many movies, but I could see the twist in this one coming a mile away. I even pinpointed the 'splice'. It just seems like I've seen this all before. Jacob's Ladder? So the sci-fi Rod Serling bit is a flop. However, the movie building towards the dopey ending was actually quite interesting. The most intriguing was the brutal reality of seeing just how crudely vital is our physical appearance. A time proven fact that moviemakers and all artists compel us to suspend when appreciating their art, but we all know has nothing to do with reality.  Example, Woody Allen getting with every hot broad in New York City. Puleeze. Cruise is a good-looking bloke, like him or not. What's more, he's great at playing the good looking bloke that gets the chicks in spite of or even as a result of his uncouth, devil may care attitude, that make the rest of us want to smack him one. This movie explores how all his successes, socially, inevitably hinged on his appearance. After he is horribly disfigured in an automobile accident, his obnoxious rake routine, carried out from behind a Quasimodo styled visage, is embarrassing to say the least. In fact, picture it in your mind right now. You know how Tom Cruise behaves when he's winning over a chick. Now imagine the Hunchback of Notre Dame acting like Tom Cruise. Doubley gruesome isn't it. There is even a scene where he and Cruz reenact the dialogue of their first meeting. It seemed witty charming and inventive when this great looking guy was performing it, but utterly awkward and dreadful coming out of the mouth of a twisted wretch. The girl now wants nothing to do with him, in spite of his wealth and everything else. He's just too freaky to look at. At this point in the film, I started thinking maybe they were onto something. But then you get the rest, and well, it's just very unsatisfying. For fans of Cruz, I will say you'll get your nudity money's worth."

","After reading some quite negative views for this movie, I was not sure whether I should fork out some money to rent it. However, it was a pleasant surprise. I haven't seen the original movie, but if its better than this, I'd be in heaven.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise gives a strong performance as the seemingly unstable David, convincing me that he is more than a smile on legs (for only the third time in his career- the other examples were Magnolia and Born on the Fourth of July). Penelope Cruz is slightly lightweight but fills the demands for her role, as does Diaz. The only disappointment is the slightly bland Kurt Russell. In the movie, however, it is not the acting that really impresses- its the filmmaking.<br/><br/>Cameron Crowe excels in the director's role, providing himself with a welcome change of pace from his usual schtick. The increasing insanity of the movie is perfectly executed by Crowe (the brief sequence where Cruise walks through an empty Time Square is incredibly effective). The soundtrack (a distinguishing feature of a Crowe movie) is also sublime.<br/><br/>
You will be shocked and challenged as a viewer. The plot does seem a little contrived but the issues explored behind it are endlessly discussable. The movie isn't perfect, but its a welcome change of pace for Cruise and Crowe and for those raised on a diet of Hollywood gloss, should be a revelation."

Suffice to say there are weird things and unexpected twists going on, beyond the initial superficial ""Tom Cruise screws around with multiple women"" plot.<br/><br/>The quality cast elevate this movie above the norm, and all the cast are well suited to their parts: Cruise as the irritatingly smug playboy who has it all - and then loses it all, Diaz as the attractive but slightly deranged jilted lover, Cruz as the exotic new girl on the scene and Russell as the fatherly psychologist. The story involves elements of romance, morality, murder-mystery, suspense and sci-fi and is generally an entertaining trip.<br/><br/>I should add that the photography is also uniformly excellent and the insertion of various visual metaphors is beautiful once you realize what's going on.<br/><br/>If you enjoy well-acted movies with twists and suspense, and are prepared to accept a slightly fantastic Philip K Dick style resolution, then this is a must-see. <br/><br/>9/10"

The Spanish filmmaker should get credit for thinking of the story first, but there's no doubt that Crowe has improved on it -- if just slightly.

","Vanilla Sky, the remake of the 1997 movie Abre los Ojos (Open Your Eyes), should have gotten better reviews.  When at glance, one immediately notices the all-star cast: Tom Cruise, Penelope Cruz, Cameron Diaz, and Kurt Russell; and great direction: Cameron Crowe.  However, before seeing the movie, all I had read was poor reviews, and all I had heard was `Don't see it, it's awful,' from my friends.<br/><br/>
Despite what was said, I loved the film.  It was not at all what I had expected, and so not to spoil the movie, I will sum it up as follows: David Ames is a wealthy, successful businessman in a relationship (with Cameron Diaz) when he meets a woman whom he falls for at first site (Penelope Cruz). Just when things seem to be perfect in David's life, he makes a decision that will ruin him and haunt him forever. Cruise is almost too perfect for the part of the superficial rich bachelor; however, I could not bring myself to feel sympathy towards his character. Diaz and Cruz, though not disappointing, left no impact on me.  The one actor with a noteworthy performance was Kurt Russell, David's therapist, who really came alive and stayed in my mind even after the film.<br/><br/>
To me, the best part of the film was the beautiful and incredible, romantic and surreal, cinematography.  I also enjoyed the story line.  After seeing the movie twice, I found connections and metaphors that I had missed the first time.<br/><br/>
This movie is 4/5 stars.  My only complaints are the poor acting and disappointing soundtrack.  I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for an offbeat film with a surprise in the end."

","What's the purpose of doing a remake of such a recent film, which is in fact great, and not even improving it at all? Easy answer: money making. Just throw in a couple of top-notch actors, a reknown director and the money will just come popping in. Doesn't matter if the movie has a dozen of plot holes in it, or if one of its main characters can barely speak english (that goes for Penelope Cruz), a fancy name and fancy actors will do it work. ""Abre los ojos"" was a great movie and it had that wonderful and attractive flavour of underground or amateur movies, totally unknown to the Hollywood scene. I mean, the original movie plot actually worked, it didn't have plot holes (or at least not much) and Penelope did sound hot. Crowe just messed up the whole story, adding scenes and symbolism of its own, making it completely hollywoodean. I just can't understand how could Alejandro Amenabar stand Crowe's destruction of one of his best movies. I guess it was the entrance price for the Hollywood Valley (Tom Cruise produced both Vanilla Sky and The Others). A real shame!"
"rankpunk","Null","0","0","17 January 2003"," When will the madness end?? *WARNING, CONTAINS SPOILERS OF VANILLA SKY AND ABRE LOS OJOS*
","I'm sorry but I have to say Abre Los Ojos, is far, far superior to Vanilla Sky.  Vanilla Sky at times, feels like a shot by shot remake.  Okay sure theres the extra plot lines about the seven dwarfs, and Sofia is not a mime in Vanilla Sky, but really it just has a stupid amount of similarities. Some of the camera shots appear to have been cut and pasted from Abre Los Ojos into Vanilla Sky.<br/><br/>The Hollywood mentality behind remakes, blows me away.  Why must they do it? How can a director do a remake and not feel like they are merely a leach ripping off someone else's film.  Its the same with 'The Ring'.  Its not original, the cleverness has worn off, so why must they do it?  I believe Crowe is an extremely talented director, and some of his direction in this film is good, but really is it his at all?  Is the inspiration the same when you're recreating a film, that is not even five years old when you start filming it??  Why could he have not pooled his talents and his resources into an original screenplay.  Why a remake which is inferior in many ways to the original source?<br/><br/>The acting for one, is extremely up and down.  Tom Cruise should never be allowed to make another movie after this.  Okay, maybe I am being a bit harsh, but his star power isn't enough to make his performance strong.  He appears muddled, and burdened by the intensity of a man torn by his nightmare.  And what about Penelope Cruz?  Was her inclusion in this film, merely a novelty, since she played the same role in the original?  Thats what it feels like because after about ten minutes, you wish she was the one in the car instead of Cameron Diaz.  Diaz is good for her brief spell, Lee shows he is one of the most underrated actors in the rotting Hollywood industry, and Russel is strong in his role.<br/><br/>Abre Los Ojos on the other hand, has strong performances all round, particualarly from Eduardo Noriega, and Chete Lera.  The bit parts in Abre Los Ojos, such as the representative of the Cryogenic company, are better as well.  Vanilla Sky's counterpart of the Cryo rep, is like some sort of joke. A weedy little man with some sort of voice disorder - like a wisp, and a nice beatles-esqe haircut.  I don't think he could EVER convince me to buy anything, let alone immortality.<br/><br/>The cinematography I briefly metioned before.  Occasionally it feels like you are watching Abre Los Ojos, because of the similarities in atmosphere and lighting.  However, to it's credit, Vanilla Sky does have some amazing photography.  A good example is the panorama shots over New York city, which Crowe describes as giving the feeling of a spirit falling.  However the endings Cinematography is baffling to say the least.  Why the sky is the colour it is, is beyond me.  I am guessing its meant to be mystical, spiritual, and dreamlike??  How about tacky, fake, and hideous.  That sums it up a bit better I think.<br/><br/>Vanilla Sky, is not a good film.  However in saying that, it is far from the worst film of the year, and chances are if you haven't seen Abre Los Ojos, or you don't care that Hollywood is sucking the life out of an innovative, brilliant, SPANISH, film, you may enjoy it.  It certainly is frustrating to see such a clever, original thriller, suddenly turned into this dramatic attempt at arthouse (i think?? hell i couldn't even come close to defining it, its so messy).  Hopefully Hollywood will stop this whole remake trend, and leave the originals the way they are.  If you can't handle subtitles, then go rent something monosyllabic.  Chances are theres a new Julia Roberts flick coming out sometime soon.  Hell, why not catch a bit of Richard Gere while you're at it?<br/><br/>4/10"

","While ultimately Vanilla Sky is not as good as Abre Los Ojos (the Spanish film on which it was based) it is still a very entertaining and though provoking film.  Tom Cruise continues to surprise with his choice of roles, and he turns in another excellent performance as David Aames.  Penelope Cruz and Jason Lee do not disappoint either as David's love interest and best friend respectively.<br/><br/>The film does manage to top the original in some areas too, particularly the now famous dream sequence in a deserted Times Square, which is far more effective than a similar scene in Abre Los Ojos.  The way in which Crowe builds on the 'dream-world' concept by using pop culture references (a Bob Dylan album cover, characters from To Kill A Mockingbird) when creating David's fictional world is also fantastic.<br/><br/>However, despite all this, Vanilla Sky does have some annoying flaws. Julie Gianni, the character played by Cameron Diaz, does not actually appear all that insane or overbearing, making it difficult for the viewer to understand why Cruise rejects her in the first place, nevermind that this rejection would make Julie crazy enough to try and kill herself.<br/><br/>Also, the ending of Vanilla Sky (unlike that of Abre Los Ojos) does feel a little spoon-fed, as if Crowe (a very mainstream director) believes that the audience should not be left to figure out anything for themselves.  This is a disappointing conclusion to what is otherwise a very thought provoking film.<br/><br/>Where this film's greatest triumph lies however is in the soundtrack, which is quite simply astounding.  Much is made of Cameron Crowe's ability to pick out exactly the right song for the moment, and rightly so on this evidence. REM, Sigur Ros, Peter Gabriel, Radiohead, Jeff Buckley, Leftfield and Bob Dylan all appear and the selection, along with their positioning in the film, is absolutely flawless.<br/><br/>So, 10/10 for the soundtrack but only 7/10 for the film, which is unfortunately just not as good as Abre Los Ojos.  Do try and see both films though, it'll be well worth your while."

But that's the secret of this movie, so just see it: with a soundtrack that's worth the admission alone, and a great performance by Cruise which shuts up those who think he's only an action hero and a pretty face, the movie also displays Cameron Crowe's skill in involving its viewers. And the movie never stops doing so, from start to finish also thanks to the beautiful cinematography by John Toll.

","It is not a spoiler to alert the viewer that we hear Sophia's voice speaking the opening lines of the movie--even though Julie is David's supposed bed partner as he awakens.  Weirdly, we hear Julie's voice repeating the same line as the last words in the movie--even though David has just launched himself back toward Sophia.  If you want to understand this very complicated movie, it might also help to notice which woman (or women?) appears floating in the sky during parts of the Times Square sequence-also in the opening minutes.<br/><br/>It is very difficult to know what to make of all this complexity--doubly so because one cannot go back and review critical passages without shelling out another $8.50.  My suspicion is that the complexity is ultimately incoherent, but maybe I still have to do some heavy lifting.  Consider a couple of additional complexities.  Is it possible that David and Brian are actually killed in the near-brush with the Mack truck in their first scene together?  After surviving, do they get out of the car?  The next cut to David entering his offices is strangely jarring.  He has changed clothes, is wearing a different watch, and has on a funny hat.  Also, David's pre-accident face-so important to the story line-is frozen into a smugly affable look throughout much of the film.  I was thinking it was poor acting on Cruise's part, but maybe it was intended. David first refuses, then wears a mask--at one point wearing it on the back of his head so that he appears to have two faces! Don't many of the other faces appear mask-like-particularly Ellen's when we finally meet her.  Is it Ellen we see floating over Times Square?<br/><br/>The trouble is, to interpret this film with the symbolism and layered meaning it seems to deserve, one has to credit Crowe and Cruise with a great deal more artistic ambition then is expected in a big budget film.

","This one in a long line of unnecessary hollywood remakes of good foreign films in the last few years...Insomnia, The Ring, The Vanishing to name a few others. The trend disturbs me a little. I don't think there's anything necessarily wrong with remaking movies and there have been some great films that are loose remakes of other films, like A Fistful of Dollars and Scarface. But to me it seems unnecessary to take an already good film and do an almost exact remake of it. For me, the worst one of all time was Gus Van Sant's near exact remake of the masterpiece, Pscyho. I don't see the point, if you're just trying to copy it. I guess the point is to make money, but I'd expect a little more from established movie makers. It's obvious that the director, Cameron Crowe, has originality. He wrote, directed, and even composed original music for his last film, Almost Famous, which happens to be my favorite movie of 2000. Maybe he used up too much on that film, which was semi-autobiographical and needed an easier fix this go round...I'm really not sure. Vanilla Sky itself wasn't awful, but I find it significantly lacking on all levels in comparison to Abre Los Ojos. Vanilla Sky lacks the heart and subtleness of the original. There are a couple things I'd like to mention, but I think it gives too much away. Another downfall is that it's glammed up with big, known faces...Tom Cruise, Kurt Russell, Cameron Diaz. Even Spielberg pops in for a cameo. However, I did find it interesting to see Penélope Cruz play Sofia in both movies, but like everything good thing in Vanilla Sky, it was just ripped off from the original. I think when these lesser known foreign gems are found, they should be brought to the U.S. and given the bigger released they deserve and not just copied.

I saw the original spanish and, i think, this pumped-up version is an improvement. But most of the people dislike it just because Tom Cruise is in it. Is fascinating to learn how many people just can't stand his face. Come on guys! He's a movie star.Not your new neighbor.Watch it as a science fiction movie with a great soundtrack!"

","For those who thought that ""Eyes Wide Shut"" was Tom Cruise's most compelling film, take a look at this surrealistic 2001 fantasy/allegory directed by Cameron Crowe (Jerry Maguire).  In one of his most introspective roles, Cruise plays David Aames, a wealthy, handsome head of a publishing company. Cameron Diaz plays Julie, David's friend and frequent sex partner whose mental instability and psychotic fixation on him (literally) drives them over the edge.  Penelope Cruz is Sofia, a luminous dancer who captures the heart of David and fuels his true masculine passions.  These three characters form a mental/emotional menage-a-trois which leads David into a harrowing sequence of events, which he relates to Dr. Curtis McCabe (Kurt Russell).  From the moment their eyes meet, the audience can sense the chemistry between Cruise and Cruz, but the MANY instances of deja vu in the movie will keep you guessing until the gripping end.  The fantasy episodes are a marvel to watch, which transports the film from its realism and turns it into perceptive imagery.  With surrealistic set-pieces (the deserted New York streets in the beginning) and artistic cinematography by John Toll, Vanilla Sky is a wondrous venture into the complexity of one man's personality, mind and soul.  Why Cruise was overlooked for a Best Actor Oscar nomination, and Cruz and Diaz for Supporting Actresses, is one of those unexplainable omissions only the AMPAS can answer.  All in all, a provocative and disturbing movie experience.  *****"

","Last night I watched Vanilla Sky with my boyfriend and as the movie passed, he got impatient... I shared his feelings, because the plot took so long to come out and in the end we were both feeling disappointed about that. You can sell anything to the viewers if sci-fi is used!!<br/><br/>I, myself, was far more intrigued by the scenes where people reacted to David's disfiguration and how Cruise portrayed the frustration and selfpity of his shallow character. That is more real than any bla-bla explanation of the concept of the Lucid Dream.<br/><br/>No way that a playboy like David Aames would fall for a naive character like Sofia and becomes dependant on her. I found Penny Cruz a big disappointment in this movie, she had nothing to 'say' or to add to the part of the other characters.<br/><br/>I like characters to be convincing in the first place when I watch a movie, or else I couldn't care less what happened to them. I couldn't care less for Sofia. Cameron Diaz and Jason Lee though, had my sympathy throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Recently I had another disappointing movie experience, with Cruise in Eyes Wide Shut.

Seems to me that at some point the viewer decides if the reward is worth the lifting and personally by the 90 minute mark I had decided that no ""explanation"" in the conclusion was going to balance out the tedium of the action. Did Cruise deserve to be wealthy? Probably no. Was he responsible? Not much. Did he ""use"" Diaz? Yes. Was she using him? Seems like it.  Did his getting into the car with Diaz after his night with Cruz justify the results? By what yardstick? Do we care about Cruise or Diaz as people? Cruz was ""cute"" but Cruise was unconvincing. Weak science fiction at the conclusion. And if the first voice saying ""open your eyes"" is Cruz's voice, then there is no moment of objective reality in the entire movie-it is all dream."

I will admit that it does have flaws in it however, Crowe's main points of the movie are expressed beautifully during the elevator scene near the end of the movie. Although it visably crushes him, David realizes that true love can exist in just one night. Crowe then uncovers one of the greatest lines of any movie I have ever seen: ""Consequences.....it's the little things"". What better way to sum up the movie then to draw back to David getting in the car with Julie?

"bo-selecta","Null","0","0","21 October 2002"," drama + romance + thriller + sci-fi = bollocks.
","Warning: Minor Spoilers Ahoy!<br/><br/>As an avid admirer of Cameron Crowe, I contemplated seeing this one at the cinema. But given the less than flattering reviews and word of mouth it received, I decided to wait a while, and I've only recently watched a preview tape I obtained from a friend.  I'm glad I didn't have to pay for it. Where do I start? Has anyone seen a Tom Cruise film - apart from Interview with a Vampire, Magnolia and maybe Born on the 4th - where he didn't portray a cocky upstart who eventually gets his comeuppance and is forced to see the error of his ways?  Has anyone seen a Tom Cruise film where he wasn't somewhat overshadowed by a member of the supporting cast? Go on, pick a film, any film. In this case, the performance honours go to Cameron Diaz (psycho hose beast from hell) Jason Lee (the cynical writer) and Timothy Spall (the boozy lawyer). IMHO, despite the real life romance, there is no palpable chemistry between Cruise and Cruz (who has yet to convince me of her potential in any American film she's done thus far).<br/><br/>
As for the film, it's a melting pot of drama, romance, thriller and mystical sci-fi. It starts off promisingly enough, but at about the hour mark, it becomes mired in its own shortcomings. Essentially, the narrative is a bit like an unholy collision between Jerry Maguire, Gattaca and Total Recall. Three quality films in their own right, but when you an attempt to throw all three into the narrative arc, well, you're most probably doomed to fail. It could have worked with some more judicious editing -ie cut at least 30m from it- and a better script. But unfortunately, the film is overblown, overlong, and self- indulgent. And don't worry, I know narcisissm/self-absorbtion is one of the film's key themes, but I don't think Crowe intended for the sheer pretentiousness and implausability of Vanilla Sky to overshadow his obvious talents.  But when you feel the need to explain the whole film (as they do in the awkward final scences) rather than let the audience figure it out for themselves, well that's just a short-cut to thinking. By the conclusion, I didn't care what was going to happen, I just wanted it to end.  Cameron Crowe: this is your dud.  I'm hoping that Vanilla Sky is just one small blip on an otherwise stellar career.  As for Mr Cruise: that cock-eyed smile and so-called ""magnetism"" of yours is starting to wear very thin.  Thought provoking, only in the provoking the thought that I'd wasted two and a half hours of my life on this.<br/><br/>Some of the cinematography is mesmerising, the music is generally top shelf, but that (and the aforementioned support cast)are about the limits of Vanilla Sky's virtues, IMHO.<br/><br/>Best line: ""She was a proximity infatuation"" (Jason Lee). Worst: Cruise's reply when Cruz asks, ""What do you want to listen to, Jeff Buckley or Maria Callas? - ""Jeff Buckley and Maria Callas ... (dramatic pause whilst Tom fixes Penelope with one of his trademark, wistful, charming stares)  ... simultaneously!""<br/><br/>Vanilla Sky? Should have just been called Navel Gazing.<br/><br/>** out of *****."

","First of all, I'd like to point out that ""Vanilla Sky"" should be not considered as a straight remake of ""Abre los ojos"", but a film that teach us how to tell the same story in a different way. The Amenábar version was darker and more creepy than Crowe's one in all elements: the story hadn't the fairytale atmosphere that ""Vanilla Sky"" has got, the characters were darker and more serious, the shots and lightning were more creepy and so on.<br/><br/>That's where ""Vanilla Sky"" had the mistake. People were expecting the dark thriller that was ""Abre los ojos"", but instead of that, the audience recieves an ""americanized"" version, more colorful and beautiful indeed, adding to the story the fairy-tale style that Crowe's has given to the film.<br/><br/>

Sure, after watching a film like Waking Life I was all about the idea of discussing dreams, but in the end it seemed like two different films were being presented to me. I will say, however, that there are some very good performances here, from Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz to the psycho crazy Cameron Diaz (and I mean k-raazy). Also, going back to how I like dream elements, I loved the odd touches that made no sense at first. In fact, they should have been left unexplained. That's what made Waking Life work, not over analyzing everything so that the whole audience 'gets' it. Just present some weird elements, leave the ending to the viewer and let them go, ""Holy crap that was odd."" Trust me, it is much cooler that way.

","I do not understand why this film is so underrated.  First off, let me say that I am not the biggest Tom Cruise fan, yet I thought his performance in ""Minority Report"" was wonderful, in addition to it being an intelligent and brilliant film.  Anyway, I related to David Aames' character.  I found myself wanting to be a pleasure delayer and hoping my girlfriend made me feel like Sophia made him feel.  Plus how could you deny a film which embodied the line ""we will meet in another life when we are both cats"".  And then witness a disfigured Tom Cruise move into an extreme close up and literally ""meow"" into the camera.  Now that's classic!  On the other hand, the whodunit element of the film did get a bit frustrating at times, but only with the first viewing. Afterwards it became an exercise in which I tried to pick up all the visual cues I missed the first time to help establish the meaning of the ending.  Also, if you know anything about Cameron Crowe films, you know that he has to tell his stories with lots and lots of popular music, and what better way to lead viewers through the process of character development than with a good soundtrack. Interestingly, what I found out while I was in film school as an undergraduate -- I'm not bragging I just feel I should provide my credentials in this area -- (I have a Bachelors degree in Cinema and Photography) -- is that people love to conform films up into one word summaries.  So, if I had to  do that with this film, i would simply say that Vanilla Sky is  merely about ""Living"".  Rather good or bad, it's up to you. Finally, I don't know if what i'm about to say is a spoiler but to support my one-word-summation-theory about Living, Sophia's character best says it when she exclaims that ""everyday is another chance to turn it all around"".  Simply put, Vanilla Sky is a wonderful film but you must pay attention to the dialogue to truly understand the brilliance of the film."

The advertising campaign had not been compelling (selling it as a strange murder mystery, which is only half right) and it has two `stars' that I don't usually care for (Cameron Diaz and Cruise).  Add to that some dire reviews I had come across, and you don't have a compelling movie experience.<br/><br/>But then along came a sale.  For $10 I was finally willing to part with some cash in the off chance that the film was actually worth the two hours or so it runs.  Boy, am I ever glad I did.<br/><br/>Total Recall is an action movie that has seen better days.  It is one of those movies that had cutting edge effects at the time of its release, and now looks horribly dated.  The sets are small, and look anything but convincing, the spaceships and masks look fake and daft.<br/><br/>Total Recall is a film that was basically a star vehicle for Schwarzenegger. It deals with the implanting of a false memory into the head of a man who was once a secret agent.  The procedure unlocks his memories, and things turn into the typical action movie from there.<br/><br/>The connection between Vanilla Sky and Total Recall is that of implanted memories.  Vanilla Sky fine tunes this idea, smooths out the rough edges, and takes the action into the realm of emotions rather that fire and explosions.  It is subtle, but no less devastating.  Its action sequences are always dream like, robbing them of the excitement they night have provided, instead feeding them with emotional impact that far exceeds what Total Recall did.  When Recall is done, you are left with adrenaline overload, with the feeling of having seen high adventure.  With Vanilla sky you can only feel a little melancholy.  Vanilla has the heart and soul, and Recall has the brawn.<br/><br/>The story of Vanilla Sky is probably well known by now, and I am not going to go over it again here.  Essentially it is the story of a man who tries to outrun his pain, only to have it catch up with him in the safest of places (his dreams).  Cruise does a fine job, as does everyone involved.  In fact, this is one of the few films that had a huge impact on me once it was done. It was 1:00am when this one ended - and I went for a walk through the streets of Landau thinking it over.  I was out for over an hour, such was the impact.<br/><br/>Once again I get to point a guilty finger at the marketing idiots who sold this movie as being something with a lot of action.  It has mystery, and that mystery can be infuriating - as everything is not revealed until the final frames.  It's a movie that you have to enter without preconceptions, and you must be willing to go along with it, keeping all your questions until the last moment.  It is also a movie that I would have hated to have seen in a cinema.  It is far better suited to a dark room, solo viewer, letting it fill the silence. All in all, Vanilla Sky is one of the most effecting viewings I have seen in recent times.  I enjoyed Black Hawk Down, but not at this level.  I'm glad I own this DVD, and look forward to seeing it many times over.  My wife has yet to see it - but I cannot wait for her reaction when she does.

Its main problem is that it is too long - it could have been a much better film if it was 20 minutes shorter. American directors did not learn that long shots are effective in European movies only because they are backed by psychological depth. Even so, the length of the plot and some of the flat acting (Kurt Russell for example) are compensated by the intriguing development at the end of the movie.

Then you wonder what has he done that brings him to this situation.  It does lead you through a convoluted story that sometimes didn't make sense, or where character and their relationships did a flip, until it is revealed at the end.  It makes you to think about one's whole existence and the perception of reality, and which state are we in now.<br/><br/>Some of the parts were a little forced upon us, mostly the ending, which is like a Scoby-Doo explain it all type of scenario.  The appearance of the tech support for a few scenes and his explanation of David's ability to change his outcome did not make too much sense since he seem to be telling David outright that his is not living in reality.  And I am not sure how in the world he forget such a shocking experience and did not try to apply it to the tragic experience he was encountering?  Others include the beginning scenes where his company is surviving and thriving for any period of time when it is under the control and management of `I don't care about anything beside having fun' David is a little incredible.  Also, the belief that one is reliving an album cover makes no sense unless one sees it from the camera perspective, which I presume, would arouse suspicion.<br/><br/>This movie seems to be Tom Cruise's venue to show his acting ability, where he is pretty much driving the whole movie.  Kurt Russell and his interaction was not convincing enough for me to believe that David was looking at the Doctor as a father figure and the Doctor was providing that back.  And forget Penélope Cruz, her acting ability seems to consist of reciting lines.<br/><br/>Cameron Crowe seem to not be able to get himself out of the 60/70's time period.  With these old cars, old music, old album cover, etc.  It is great when the plot revolves around it or when it is set in that time period, but when you see everything revolve around it, it kind of detract from the feel of the movie.<br/><br/>A interesting film on lucid dreams is Waking Life, where the subject parallels this film, but with a little more of am I asleep or am I awake question.<br/><br/>Overall, a good film, with some quirks, but with lots of thoughts to ponder upon."

","I found this movie to be in turn challenging, frustrating and intriguing. I did feel manipulated by the director, Cameron Crowe, but that is his job. Tom Cruise did a solid job as David Aames, not quite as good as in Minority Report.  Penelope Cruz showed limited range, but did have good chemistry with Tom (which later continued offscreen.)  Jason Lee was excellent as David's best friend, as was Cameron Diaz as his sometime lover Julie. Kurt Russell was fair as David's psychiatrist. I found the ending a little too tidy.  Maybe I should see it again to truly judge it.  I would have rather have solved the mystery through the story. The use of music was effective for the most part. The eclectic soundtrack mirrored Cruise's confusion. I was disturbed by the characters' lack of spiritual awareness.  There was no questioning of God by David at any time during his ordeal. That just accentuated his superficiality.  Sophia, meaning ""divine wisdom"" was supposed to fill that void in his life.  That could have been better developed.  The movie could have been edited better, especially in the first half.  I'd say it is most similar to the Matrix and the Sixth Sense, which deal with similar themes of ontology."

","that's what I was thinking after viewing the DVD.  I gave it a 7, which for me is already a good mark as I need a lot to be impressed by a movie.  Tom Cruise plays Tom Cruise, both girls are quite good and so is Jason Lee.  It's not the type of movie you'll fall asleep in front of.  You have to like plots in which you get lost, confused - OK not as ""mental"" as Lynch would do but during the entire time you will be wondering : is he dreaming now or not ?  It also shows how weak guys can be, the main character just met what could be the love of his life and he's ready to (and in the end does) jeopardize everything for a last ""time"" with his ""sleeping buddy"".  Rather typical, maybe that's the morale of the story...  Also I'm not an expert in plastic surgery but you would think that - especially if money is no option - nowadays surgeons can do a pretty good job fixing people's face after an accident, no ?  The film also shows how in fact you can loose your mind taking painkillers and other medications, what is reality and what's not ?  And what's that snobbery about having only poster of French movies on the wall ?  And whatabout the ""empty Time Square"" scene ?  Isn't that just a gimmick used to make the media talk about the film during it's making - great publicity stunt isn't it ?!  But does it really bring something to the movie, or is it just another dream scene to make sure you're lost from the word go ? Another question this movie is asking is : in this superficial world we live in, could one still be in love with another after this person gets disfigured, could you still kiss that person ?  Is it ""ok"" to steal you best friend's new girlfriend ? SO as the others have already said it might not be the best film ever but the picture will make you think, wonder and can be the start of great discussions among friends and that's already something, isn't it ?..."

"dimfeld","7","0","0","2 August 2002"," Good until the very end
","Most of Vanilla Sky was done well.  The characters are interesting.  The plot leaves the viewer guessing until the last five minutes or so, when the movie ends in an unfortunate manner.  Basically, one of the characters just tells David (Tom Cruise) what was actually going on throughout the movie. Rather than letting him and the audience discover it for themselves, the movie simply tells you in a conversation.  I found this quite disappointing. Now, I didn't have a problem with what the ending was.  It actually fit quite well.  I simply wish it was presented in a different fashion.<br/><br/>The only other flaw in this movie was the music.  Cameron Crowe has a bad habit of using classic rock in his movies in rather inappropriate places. Most of the time it fits well, but there were a few scenes in which the music didn't fit the action at all.  Classic rock is fine and appropriate for a movie like Almost Famous, which is about the music world, but for other movies, such as this and Jerry Maguire, sometimes a good instrumental is all you need.  The music problem, however, was but a minor annoyance that only manifested in one or two scenes.<br/><br/>Despite the expository ending, I do recommend this movie.  Better yet, see Abre Los Ojos."

"NKMacGuffin","Null","0","0","1 August 2002"," Bold, trippy, incomprehensible
","Vanilla Sky is a bold, experimental journey into man's dreams and desires. But has Cameron Crowe has taken a radical departure from his typical style, or a departure from his senses? !!SOME SPOILERS INCLUDED!!<br/><br/>Vanilla Sky is based on the Spanish film Abre Los Ojos, co-written and directed by Alejandro Amenábar (The Others). Tom Cruise plays David Aames, a millionaire playboy whose wild, womanizing ways have led him into a disastrous affair and a crippling accident with his lover, Julie Gianni (Cameron Diaz). The same night of the accident, he meets another woman: the enigmatic, adorable Sofia (Penélope Cruz, who played this role in the original).<br/><br/>After the accident, David's life comes falling apart. His face resembling the Frankenstein monster and limping like Igor, he falls into a deep depression. His best friend (Jason Lee) appears to be stealing away Sofia, and control of his family business is slipping away at the hands of his board of directors. While we are supposed to believe that his mental crisis is abetted by the symptoms of his injuries, it's hard not to believe that David's depressed because, frankly, he's gone from looking like Tom Cruise to the Elephant Man. The events described above are told to us from prison. A police shrink (Kurt Russell) is evaluating David while he awaits a trial for murder. We know early on that he is supposed to have murdered someone, but for the first two thirds of the film, we are not sure exactly who. Until we learn more about this murder, it is fairly easy to take the narrative at face value. But when the shrink starts dragging more memories out of the reluctant David, we discover that not all of what we have seen makes sense.<br/><br/>The last third of the film completely falls apart. We are shown more and more about what led David to be charged with murder, but there is no logical way to piece together the narrative. When the story started winding around itself like a boa constrictor, I held out hope that we were supposed to puzzle out the solution to the contradictions. We hope to get inside David's head before the shrink does, but it's not that simple. In fact, there's no way to solve the puzzle. I am not going to reveal the film's explanation for the contrarian nature of the plot. Audiences love to solve mysteries and draw their own conclusions, but in this film, the solution is given to you in the last half hour and the choice to interpret the events is yanked away.<br/><br/>Filmmakers love it when people walk out of the theater discussing their perspectives on the story, but after this film, you have nothing to do but scratch your head. We are forcibly pushed out of the film; when you don't know who is real and what really happened, how are you supposed to care about the fate of the characters? While Cruise is effective as the former playboy tortured by the hand of fate, he plays at a strong disadvantage. For about a third of his screen time, he wears an amazing, award-worthy prosthetic face that transforms his million-dollar mug into a hideous, lopsided pile of skin and bone. For another third of the film, he wears a skin-tone therapeutic mask, which transforms him into a short, limping, well-dressed mannequin. The problem is, we only get to see any of his face for the scenes when he is untroubled and content- when he really gets to sink his teeth into meaty material, we can't see it.<br/><br/>Penélope Cruz is the Hype of the Year. All she has to do here is talk sweet nothings with a Spanish accent, bat her fifty-yard eyelashes at Cruise, and her freckles are supposed to win me over? There's nothing happening there. Cameron Diaz, however, is fabulous as the jilted lover on the verge of mental collapse. Diaz plays the quiet desperation and ragged edge of sanity with subtlety and aplomb. Given the chance to shine in a brief but complex role, it's nice to see her rise to the occasion.<br/><br/>Something about the original 1997 Spanish film Abre Los Ojos (Open Your Eyes) clearly drew Crowe and Cruise to this project. You have to respect them for attempting such an experiment. But that doesn't mean you have to enjoy watching it."

","***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** It really bothers me that people have such a hard time with this movie. They hate the end because they think it's only a ""dream."" The movie begins with, Sophia saying, ""open your eyes."" I don't take this as wake up, it's only a dream. To me it's something David needs to do in his life. He is half awake not really understanding consequences of his actions. His a rich spoiled man that imagines the world as his playground. This is easily done, since everyone allows him to function this way. He only knows the sweet, his friend is constantly telling him that it doesn't taste as good without the bitter. David's life is charmed, he needs to open his eyes and have some real responsibility. He treats Julie like crap, but only because she lets him. Everything that happens is because people let David act the way he does. Suddenly, David's world is not what it seems. If you just want to use the phrase, ""it was all just a dream,"" fine, go ahead, but it's more than that. He had an opportunity to ""dream"" all the perfect dreams that he wanted to. To have a life with Sophia, a perfect life with a woman that for one night helped open his world up. Instead, he lets his sub conscience play nasty tricks on him. He cannot have the perfect life with Sophia, because he does not believe he deserves it. He gives himself a serious case of the ""bitters"" in order for him to understand how sweet life really was. The movie gives us, the audience what we need, an explanation. He ties up all the loose ends for us and yells at us to open our eyes. Everything David did had consequences, he was protected from them because he had money. Julie took that comfort away from him when she drove her car of the road. She shattered his perfect world and in her own way, screamed, Open Your Eyes. His eyes seemed slammed shut for such a long time. I loved this movie, everything about it. It was well acted, I usually don't like Penelope but she was very likable. The idea that true love can exist is so sad when you realize how much it will always haunt Sophia. What would have happened if David never got into that car. Would he and Sophia had been together? Would Julie still have killed herself? David would never be able to open his eyes if his face and world weren't shattered. I recommend this movie to anyone that believes in the possibility of true love and the idea that everything we do, small or huge has an impact on someone else."

Tom Cruise (by the way I never was a huge fan of his) gives one of the best on-screen performances I have ever had the pleasure of witnessing. His looks and charm work in this film and I couldn't think of a better actor to portray the lucky/lonely David Aames! Penelope Cruz does an extremely good job of reprising her role as the mystically beautiful Sofia. Two things that annoy me about the reviews of this film - the lack of appreciation for Cruz's AND Kurt Russell's performances!! Ms. Cruz is SUPERB as the enigmatic Sofia and it pains me to see American critics downplay her acting abilities. It seems that when a foreigner that is popular in their home country crosses over to American films the critics in this land don't seem to appreciate their talent and write them off as ""another pretty face"".<br/><br/>Another hidden jewel of this work of art is KURT RUSSELL!!! His portrayal as the caring and hopeful Dr. McCabe is his best work to date. I think people have always written him off as a Hollywood ""Hunk?"" with no real acting ability and he was completely ignored for Oscar consideration as Best Supporting Actor for his role! His performance is moving and heart-warming and seems to be David Aames' only true ally and friend. I feel that his work in this film alone should finally legitimize him as a true artist in this field. I defy anyone to oppose this view - he is simply brilliant in this movie. The incomparable Jason Lee is equally brilliant as Cruise's best friend! His sarcastic wit and ""loser charm"" are endearing and should propel him to ""larger"" roles in the future.

","For all of those who expected another Jerry Maguire from the reteaming of Cameron Crowe and Tom Cruise will be horribly dissapointed in fact this movie is probably closer in comparison to Eyes Wide Shut than Jerry Maguire, for everyone else with an open mind this may be just your ticket. If there ever was a movie that is too complex for its own good this would be the one, but not in a bad sense. The film is beautifully written by Crowe and had many layers to it. One minute it is a heart-felt love story, next it could be a tense erotic thriller, an engaging suspence picture and finally even a slight hint of sci-fi here and there. Tom Cruise is great as a rich snobbish business man who can't seem to tell what is a dream and what is reality. This film is like The Sixth Sense in that you will probably need to watch it several times to pick up all the hints and clues that lead up to the delightful suprise ending. Crowe and Crusie make a great team and Crowe works his magic behind the camera and Cruise gives us a treat for our eyes.

Had I rented this instead of paying $9 admission, I would have given up after a half-hour and returned it.  Unfortunately, my local movieplex has cracked down on cinema-switchers and has instituted a strict no-refunds policy, so I was stuck with it.  The only part of this film to stir any emotion in me, other than confusion at the plot and anger at the ad industry for misrepresentation, was unintentional and very much relied upon having a theater full of moviegoers around me.  I saw this film a couple of months after the September 11 terrorist attacks.  At the ludicrous finale, as Tom Cruise teeters on a Manhattan rooftop, the twin towers of the World Trade Center are visible in the background.

Penelope, well she just lights up the screen whenever she is in focus.<br/><br/>The truly funny part of the movie is when Mr. Vanity gets booked at the police station, and he is shown being photographed at a height of about six feet tall.  You wish Tommy!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>He is short and so is his talent.<br/><br/>In case you have't guessed it, I didn't like this movie."

","This movie in my opinion was fantastic. The cinematography was beautiful, the acting superb, the hints fun to spot... What I hear over and over again is that the movie is hard to follow, I have to say, I have no idea why. The movie may have a few twists, but for the most part, it is pretty simple. One of the ways it is so easy to understand is that it is left open to your own views.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't tell you what to think about it, it gives you options. There are a ton of theories out there as to what happened, what it was all about, what happened afterwards... it is up to you. But many people want a movie to tell them what to think, and aren't used to being left with options.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of movies that make you think, and allow you to draw your own conclusions, this one is for you.

","the film is beautifully directed by cameron crowe and the photogaphy is outstanding.  jason lee as the somewhat envious best friend of tom cruise was stellar.  however, to view this film and really enjoy it, you must empathize with the protagonist - in this case david ames (tom cruise).  i just couldn't do it.  i found myself not really caring to know what was actually happening to him or why.  i just did not feel sorry for him and his plight.  thus, in the end, i just didn't buy the plot.<br/><br/>
the spanish film, abre los ojos, of which vanilla sky is a remake, is the opposite however.  i was completely wrapped up in cesar's (david in vanilla sky)pain and frustration.  eduardo noriega did a much better job of playing the handsome, rich, playboy cum psychiatric patient with little/fuzzy memory, than tom cruise did.  at the end of abre los ojos, i completely bought every plot twist and turn. . .as for vanilla sky, i just couldn't bring myself to care."

","I like this film because it makes you think. It is in no way a standard feel good film or action flick in the traditional sense. The trailers for the film are rather misleading because none of them mention anything besides the fact that Cruz, Cruise, and Diaz are in it.<br/><br/>A lot of critics hated this film because of the plot. Perhaps that's why the studios didn't advertise it. However, judging from the reviews of other people on this site, this film has found an appreciative audience.<br/><br/>Vanilla Sky challenges the viewer to figure out what is real and what is not. Its plot is a close cousin of films like Jacobs Ladder, The Others, Mullholand Drive, Fight Club, Lost Highway, The Matrix, The Sixth Sense. All of these films play off the concept of alternate realities. If you like films that make you wonder if you're living a dream, then check out this film.<br/><br/>My only personal qualm with the film is that, if you take it literally, you have no reason to fear death and therefore can do horrible things to others, and to yourself, and somehow be a better person because of it. That is... IF you have enough money. I don't think this something the director or writer was purposefully trying to portray, but that's what I got out of the film, among other, less selfish things. All this means that the director didn't have a concise vision for the film. <br/><br/>Vanilla sky is a spooky, eerie, thought provoking film. But because of a jumbled vision, the film will not be a classic. It COULD have been better but it's not bad at all. I give it 80% out of 100%. Better than average but not A material."

","Vanilla Sky commences with a disconcerting opening. Spoilers. Tom Cruise running through Times Square and not a soul to be seen. Thankfully it's just a scary dream of no significance, at least that's the opinion of his shrink. <br/><br/>We then go on to see that David Aames (Tom Cruise) is the son of a highly respected businessman whose biography is a best seller. Only he is no longer alive and David is a 51% shareholder in his previously overseen company. The remaining percentage is distributed evenly among 7 board members, whom David refers to as the seven dwarfs. His personal life is somewhat a mess. He's attracted to his best friend's love interest while stringing along another eccentric woman Julie Gianni played by Cameron Diaz. After a romantic date with Sofia Serrano played by Penelope Cruz, he is confronted by Julie Gianni (Cameron Diaz) `What about promises' She protests as she drives of a bridge committing suicide and leaving David comatose. David eventually wakes up from the comma with extensive face and nerve damage and assumes his daily roles with grace. <br/><br/>At this point the movie begins to portray Tom's subconscious, because in actuality he is dead and in a life extension trance. He conveys his hopes, dreams, desires and fears in this state for the latter part of the movie, using prior knowledge from life and stereotypes. Although this movie is very intricate, it's smart because it held my attention and portrayed the many truths of life. While the movie is unique it's also similar to Brain Scan, The Matrix and Total Recall. <br/><br/>Kurt Russell is extraordinary in his portrayal of an ordinary psychiatrist, who desperately wants to believe his client. Both Tom and Kurt acted beautifully and complimented each other. Cameron Diaz was frightfully convincing as the eccentric stalker and Penelope Cruz was sweet as aspired girlfriend. My overall assessment: 9/10."

","**Warning*Spoilers**<br/><br/>A number of films in recent history have been released concerning<br/><br/>warped realities, dreams and mental illness - Fight Club<br/><br/>American Psycho and Mulholland Drive to name just three - which<br/><br/>attempt to undermine the viewers belief in the protagonists reality<br/><br/>thereby providing an entertaining plot twist. The hitherto mentioned<br/><br/>films did this with varying degrees of success. Mulholland Drive<br/><br/>did this strategy brilliantly since the viewer is left to work it out by<br/><br/>themselves while leaving some level of doubt. American Psycho<br/><br/>(especially in the book) was able to achieve this as well. Fight<br/><br/>Club had one failing: every aspect about this warped reality twist<br/><br/>was revealed and in so doing the audience was treated like a<br/><br/>child. Vanilla Sky, like Fight Club, destroys a reasonably good<br/><br/>concept film by demystifying the story.<br/><br/> The first words in the dialogue  Open Your Eyes' spoken by<br/><br/>Sophia (Penelope Cruz) in the first instance are a link to the<br/><br/>original movie and, in the second instance a clue to unravelling<br/><br/>the twist. With these soft words we are awoken to the extravagances of David Aames' life. Aames (Tom Cruise) is filthy<br/><br/>rich, handsome and charming; his life seems like a dream to the<br/><br/>rest of us proletariat. Aames is having what he believes is a<br/><br/>casual affair with Julie (Cameron Diaz) but he falls, immediately,<br/><br/>in love with Sophia at his own party. Heart broken and desperate<br/><br/>Julie commits suicide by driving her car over a bridge with Aames<br/><br/>inside of it. Consequently, Aames is disfigured and almost loses<br/><br/>the three things that made his life a dream: his good looks, the<br/><br/>company left to him by his father and the woman he loves.<br/><br/>
Miraculously, his dream life returns: his face is reconstructed; he<br/><br/>retains ownership of his company and; Sophia loves him not for<br/><br/>his looks but for who he really is. However, his life once again<br/><br/>becomes a surreal nightmare when the dead Julie seems to be<br/><br/>alive and acting as Sophia  did that sentence make sense?   <br/><br/>
This story is told from the point of view of Aames in a prison cell<br/><br/>who is accused of murder. To prepare a defence he tells his story<br/><br/>to a psychiatrist who finally forces Aames to remember the<br/><br/>incident where he murders Sophia when he thought she was<br/><br/>Julie. Is that the end? Of course its not. Aames also remembers a<br/><br/>freaky incident in a bar where a dorky guy in a suit convinces him<br/><br/>that he is some sort of God. No no he is not a God but only in a<br/><br/>dream induced by cryogenics. That's right, he killed himself after<br/><br/>was disfigured and began a dream while cryogenically frozen.<br/><br/>Yawn. (I just reread what I just wrote and it sounds really silly. Wait<br/><br/>a minute maybe it's not my writing but the movie itself.)<br/><br/>Okay, so the plot is disappointing. However Cameron Crowe is<br/><br/>undoubtedly a talented director who proved his worth with his<br/><br/>previous film Almost Famous. One scene in Vanilla Sky demonstrates his talent. The nightclub scene showed his talent<br/><br/>with lighting and camera work. It also showed his talent with<br/><br/>actors which is poignantly demonstrated by the extremely<br/><br/>awkward moment where a drunk Aames, in a desperate move to<br/><br/>renew their relationship, forces Sophia to reminisce their first<br/><br/>flirtatious encounter. Lastly, and most importantly, this scene<br/><br/>demonstrates his knowledge and awareness of music as a<br/><br/>necessary tool to convey the emotions of the characters to the<br/><br/>audience. There are few directors who use music as effectively as<br/><br/>Crowe. Throughout this movie he uses the music to not only<br/><br/>convey the emotions but also to mock them, which is reminiscent<br/><br/>of the great Kubrick.<br/><br/>In the end this is a hard move to judge because you have a<br/><br/>talented director and a mildly interesting story but ruined by a poor<br/><br/>ending. <br/><br/>6/10  6 for Crowe's performance."

","What a mess.  Most of the ""messy"" films you'll see are messy because of editing.  This one is messy because the plot is too thick.  There are arguably four or five plot points in this film.  However, as ugly as it gets sometimes, Vanilla Sky is interesting and somewhat perplexing (in a good way) and I generally liked it for the most part.<br/><br/>Yes, Cameron Crowe is out of his element here.  Just like the Coen brothers have no business doing a romantic comedy, Crowe doesn't need to be sticking his head in stories like this.  Mainly because his style brings nothing to the table in this kind of film.  His trademark character monologues and epiphanies simply convolute the film more than it already is and the ""dancing"" he does around the central part of the story is alright in simple minded films like Singles and Almost Famous, but we don't need that here.<br/><br/>I think you'd really have to go out of your way to spoil this film, but I'll just stick to the basics anyway.  The first half hour or so of the film is bad.  The Tom Cruise character is an arrogant prick, as he is in every other one of his films, but he's an unlikeable arrogant prick in this one.  And the Cameron Diaz character is equally unlikeable.  Someone must have told Penelope Cruz that if she spoke English but didn't lose any of her Spanish accent, she'd sound cute and adorable and everyone would love her.  Doesn't work on me.  She's just as annoying as Cruise and Diaz. <br/><br/>
So what did I like about this film you ask?  Basically, when the plot starts to jump around, the film gets interesting.  I didn't like all of the plot turns and a couple of them don't make any sense, even after finishing the film, but the premise is fascinating once it gets going.  And I did like the way in which the story was presented, in the meeting between Cruise and Kurt Russell.  Moderate spoiler ahead...<br/><br/>Some people might not like to constantly be second guessing what they're seeing onscreen, but I generally do.  Watching this film, you never know if you're seeing the past, present or future, or if what you're seeing is real or a dream.  Or a hallucination.  <br/><br/>There's plenty to criticize and plenty to be annoyed with in Vanilla Sky. But the flip side is a little more plentiful, in my opinion. ""B-"""

I don't mind remakes if they're presenting a fresh spin on the original (i.e. Eddy Murphy's version of ""The Nutty Professor"") but why remake a movie if you're just copying it shot for shot?  Why not come up with an original idea instead?  This posed a problem for the ""Psycho"" remake and it is poses a problem for ""Vanilla Sky.""<br/><br/>
Seriously though, it doesn't matter whether you see ""Vanilla Sky"" or ""Open Your Eyes"" since they are 95% identical.  You'll be getting the same bang for your buck either way.  I, however, will watch the former."

Making a good movie is harder, because it has to be good from start to finish. Making a twist ending movie is harder still because it essentially has to be two separate films.  One for the people who have never seen it before, and a separate movie for those who have and who can catch what's going on for real.  And a good twist ending movie is even harder, because it not only is good the first and second time, but the third as well, because you're still getting more out of it.  I never figured out who Elle was until the third time I watched it.  My suggestion is to watch this movie at least three times."

Whilst the picture is often entertaining, it is confusing and uneven in parts and I had the impression that much of the film was made up as it went along even though at the end that was unlikely to be the case but that was the impression given to me. On the plus side....nice music, good special effects though the Spanish actress seem to be there more for her looks than talent. It is true that as the story unfold various ""clues"" are given as to where the plot is going but unlike for instance Matrix which can be said to be in the classic category, Vanilla Sky is a victim of its own confusion and that dilutes much of what ought to be a thought provoking theme.

","SPOILER ALERT!! Cover versions.  The last refuge of the talentless.   Think of all your favourite songs, and then think of all the space-wasters who ruined them (for some reason Madonna's unforgivable ""American Pie"" springs to mind). But then think of John Cale doing ""Hallelujah"" or Soft Cell doing ""Tainted Love"".  So maybe the cover version can be a noble art form - taking something that was great and shedding new light on it, showing it from a different angle.  So, okay, musical cover versions are acceptable when done with style and imagination, but in the world of movies, they should still be avoided like the plague.  Right?  Certainly when it comes to such dismal travesties as Tim Burton's reimagining of ""Planet of the Apes"" the only sane response is an arson attack on any cinema daring to show it.  But then what about Kaufman's ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers""?  Surely the exception that proves the rule. And, by Christ, don't get me started on Hollywood's endless fascination with taking decent foreign-language movies and turning them into shameless duds, often starring Tom Selleck. And so, after several paragraphs of self-indulgent guff, we come to the actual subject of this piece, Mister Cameron Crowe's ""Vanilla Sky"".  A remake, for no apparent reason, of one of the coolest European films of recent years, ""Open Your Eyes"". Why was ""Vanilla Sky"" ever made?  Why remake a very good movie?  I have no idea.  But, as is so often the way with movies that exist for no sane reason, ""Vanilla Sky"" is actually amazingly good. In fact, it may well be the most under-rated movie of 2001.<br/><br/>In fact, I will even go so far as to say that the years will be kinder to ""Vanilla Sky"" than to many recent movies, and that time will reveal it to be a genuinely-inspired ""reimagining"" (Oh God) of a classic movie, and the work of a genuine pop-culture artist. This is such a complex film that all its bad points could easily be seen as good ones.  Please, stay with me.  The worst failing of the movie is that Cruise's face is not nearly as f*cked-up as Noriega's in OYE. When we first see Noriega's damaged features we are genuinely shocked.  When we first see Cruise's damaged features, we are thinking, ""What the hell is his problem - a few scars?  Big deal!""  But, I would argue this could in fact be seen as a sly comment on the whole thing - Cruise's character is so perfect that the slightest imperfection makes his life unbearable and the whole fabric of reality falls apart.  Is this in fact a sly comment on the Hollywood Star Machine itself?  Possibly. Also, the finale, which in OYE was brilliantly demented, is more sedate and less inspired here.  Again, however, this can be seen as a plus, because it grants us that great moment when Kurt Russell is asked his daughters' names and can't think of them.  Also, the climax of ""Vanilla Sky"" takes place with the WTC in the background, adding a certain strange poignancy to the sequence - if this is all a dream, well, wouldn't you want your dream world to be one where 11/9/01 never happened? On the plus side, well, as Beth Orton intones on the end credits, where do I begin?  I think my favourite moment (it's that kind of film, full of people's favourite moments) is the one where it is revealed that Cruise's character has been filling his dream world with images from popular culture - the cover of a Dylan album, a character from ""To Kill a Mockingbird"".<br/><br/>Cameron Crowe, the writer/director is so suffused with pop culture that his film bursts at the seams with references to movies, music, literature, architecture, clothes, and Lord knows what else.  The soundtrack is fantastic, the film's autumnal glow is seductive and very easy on the eye, and the performances of all concerned are dazzling and believable. ""Open Your Eyes"" was always going to have the benefit of surprise behind it, so any remake was never going to have that same shock value.  That said, ""Vanilla Sky"" is one of the most thought-provoking, intelligent, un-patronising, unpredictable, un-annoying movies to come out of Hollywood for many years.  I hope it develops a cult following, because it deserves a lot better than to slip into obscurity. If you've already seen it, see it again.  If you haven't already seen it, well, what are you waiting for?"

We know Tom Cruise has a smile to die for but we were not (until now) aware he has a very gifted comical side/depressing on the edge of hysteria.

He's a man who suddenly has his whole life turn into a bizarre, surreal world where nothing makes sense and everything is constantly changing. The way he handles the transition from easy-going to boiling-with-frustration is great, and we, the audience, buy the transition because we sort of go through it for ourselves as well.<br/><br/>The film has its share of surreal images and ""art house movie"" moments, something I usually don't go for, but there was just something about this film that made it all work.

Kurt Russell is good (as always) as the psychiatrist who wants to help Cruise figure things out and determine if he is responsible for the murder he's being charged with.<br/><br/>It's not a film I would watch over and over again, and it could have been a little shorter (a couple scenes went on a little too long), but overall it was a satisfying movie that will have you confused, frustrated, and amazed until the very end."
"chrisbrown6453","6","0","0","12 June 2002"," Vanilla Sky is Cameron Crowes adaptation of 1997s Spanish thriller Abre Los Ojos. And in this film, we indeed open our eyes to the bizarre and intriguing life of millionaire David Aames.
","Its a fantasy, so even if there are many unrealistic and silly moments, they can be excused. Solid (bordering on strong) performances, excellent direction and a generally clever script make this film one of 2001s most pleasant surprises.<br/><br/>The film doesnt quite match Crowes previous effort, Almost Famous. It lacks the Oscarcalibre performances, the script isnt as well written and not every character is well developed. But he has still made a thoroughly entertaining and sometimes debatable film with quite a few memorable scenes.<br/><br/>Here, Tom Cruise (Aames) makes the transformation from action hero to eventually troubled millionaire, and he actually does it quite well. While he occasionally overacts and seems nervous at times, he still does a fine job, even allowing us to sympathize with his character. It seems that, like in Jerry Maguire, Crowe knows how to get a good performance from the actor. Cruises current reallife love interest Penelope Cruz also gives a good display, mixing radiance with surprising effectiveness. Most of the stronger parts of the film feature her and Cruise, and chemistry between them is (unsurprisingly) strong. Meanwhile, Cameron Diaz is at ease in her overthetop, if slightly small role. These roles seem to suit her well, and she plays this one to great effect. Other notable performers are Jason Lee as Davids friend, Kurt Russell as a mildmannered psychiatrist, and Noah Taylor as a mysterious stranger. <br/><br/>The film has many surprises. You feel involved in nearly every scene, and most of the time, you cant tell whats coming next. The final twist to the story is indeed unexpected, even if it is a bit too bizarre and causes the film to drag on longer than it should. Also, the film is maybe a little too sentimental at times, and the scenes dont always link clearly together. Thankfully, Crowe manages to prevent the film from becoming a mess. Set design is attractive, and the music, which includes the use of songs by R.E.M. and Paul McCartney, blends in well.<br/><br/>I think calling this a masterpiece would be going a bit too far (its problems are all too visible, notably the slightly confusing beginning and overlong end), but this is a wellmade and constantly involving film which shouldnt be missed."

It seems that Crowe was a lot more interested in the romantic line of action between and also Cruise's profession came into play a lot more in Crowe's adaptation.  More time was devoted to the love that was developing between Cruise and Cruz (weird) before his accident, which was good.  The story involving his job was a little cheese, but whatever.  It also lacked the same psychological element as the original...but Crowe was obviously more interested in Cruise's romantic dreams, which helped because otherwise (my ultimate point), it's the same movie.

Although for me it tied together well, it is one of those films that allows the viewer the luxury of watching it again and seeing many more layers and possible solutions to the puzzle laid before you.  The acting was great, with the possible exception of Penelope Cruz in a few scenes. (I felt she played a little too much on her foreign intrigue rather than true acting skill in a couple of spots [Just a very few spots]).  <br/><br/>One of the players that I feel may have gotten overlooked was Cameron Diaz. She was TOTALLY believable, even when she seemed to flip from playful to deadly serious in the blink of an eye--and she did evil very well.  Tom Cruise is one of the most overlooked actors in Hollywood, in my opinion.  He is always solid and is much more than a pretty face.  Unfortunately, he is usually surrounded by bundles of talent (Jerry Maguire, Rainman) and oftens get overlooked.  This is probably his best delivery in his career as of yet. And Jason Lee holds his own.  He is not over-powered by the ""beautiful"" people he is surrounded by.<br/><br/>Cameron Crowe is a masterful storyteller, and I am glad he does not just go for the easy quick Hollywood fix.

","It's interesting to see how vehement people's reviews of this movie are. I'm not surprised, since all of Philip K. Dick's ideas have invariably pushed buttons in people from every walk of life. In this case, Dick's UBIK provided the core of Abre los Ojos, which provided the framework and canvas for Vanilla Sky.<br/><br/>What's important to remember in Crowe's version is that this ""remake"" of Abre los Ojos is clearly American. The characters, the setting, the dialog, the inside jokes about New York and the publishing world -- if you don't know this culture, you may miss some of the tongue-in-cheek digs.<br/><br/>Cameron Crowe didn't ""rip-off"" Abre los Ojos, as he has been accused. He didn't just ""adapt"" it, either. What has happened here reminds me of those famous Van Gogh studies of Japanese paintings. Van Gogh was intrigued by Japanese artwork, and he had the opportunity to study prints of Hiroshige's woodcuts and Eisen's ""The Courtesan."" But instead of merely copying these prints, Van Gogh re-interpreted them using bold strokes, rich, vibrant colors, and the mark of impressionistic work: capturing the impressions of detail at a distance, while things are blurred up close. One sees the meaning only when the whole picture is taken in.<br/><br/>So Vanilla Sky is really an impressionistic re-working, or re-interpretation, of Abre los Ojos, which was in itself an interpretation of Philip K. Dick's _UBIK_. But this doesn't lessen the impact of Vanilla Sky in any way. It stands alone as its own slice of (possible) life, a study of superficial human foibles layered, like the skin of an onion, over the core of human reality."

Nothing wrong with these things, of course, but when they comprise the entirety of a performance, I just stop wanting to watch.

Her entire performance here is a revelation, and a lovely one.<br/><br/>Cruise, on the other hand, is his usual self; once again, he tries to follow the Pacino school of flail-around-and-yell-throat-wreckingly, which works just fine when Pacino does it himself, but falls flat when someone lacks the great man's ability. Which Cruise, sadly, does. It may have been the script, or it may have been just him (which I'm inclined to believe), but I failed to develop any empathy (or, for that matter, any *liking*) for the man during the entire two hours or so.

Penelope Cruz, on the other hand, wasn't nearly as bad as I'd expected, so perhaps it all balances out in the end.<br/><br/>Did this movie leave me guessing at the end? Heck no; not to give anything away, but the entire story is neatly (if a little cheaply) within the last fifteen minutes of the film. Are there great moments of tedium?

Penelope Cruz is her usual sweet self. <br/><br/>Jason Lee, however, is magnificent. He really is one of the finest actors in Hollywood, and his attitude towards beards is commendable. His small role in Vanilla Sky is electric, and he is never overshadowed by the Cruiser.<br/><br/>
So, for about an hour, this is a superb film. It is creepy, shocking, sexy, funny and utterly compelling. Then Cameron Crowe throws it all down the pan for the sake of a bad twist-in-the-tail. What a shame.<br/><br/>Noah Taylor, who is great in Almost Famous, is very annoying. His calm, drab monotone and white suit were so irritating, I wanted to throw my coffee at the screen. Shut up! Plus, the Cruiser decides to forget how to act for the last 20 minutes of the movie, right after he screams ""Tech Support!"" in the lobby of L.E. Some of the scriptwriting during the end scene is terrible, too, particularly coming from Kurt Russell. Shame on you Cameron, you can do so much better.<br/><br/>Great beginning, terrible ending. A huge disappointment, because it could have been much, much better. The soundtrack, unlike the movie, is uniformly excellent (Beach Boys, Red House Painters, Jeff Buckley).<br/><br/>And, if you think about it, the final scene was a bit tasteless; something about a body falling from a tall building in New York..."

Do not go to see this movie if you are looking for one of the standard hollywood dramas.  This movie is not just a murder/mystery.  Things will almost seem to make sense, and then there will be a short, totally bizzare sequence, and your idea of the plot is totally shot.  However, about 3/4 of the way through, I did come close to figuring out what was going on, I still wasn't sure until the very end. And the ending was as satisfying and thought provoking as any I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Although I enjoy most of the movie's that Tom Cruise has made, I'm not an avid fan of his.  However, I thought this was one of his best performances. Although I don't like the type of person his character was, his performance made me really care what happened to him.  But I really think that Penelope Cruz really stole the show.  Her portrayal of Sophia was so wonderful that I almost fell in love with her.<br/><br/>If you're looking for this movie to be another hollywood clone, with a standard plot, simple, straightforward characters, and uninteresting dialogue, then this movie will sadly disappoint you.  However, if you enjoy, a deep, thought provoking movie, one that will affect you on a multitude of emotional levels, then this is a movie you must see.  I watched it with a couple of friends late tonight, and I plan on watching it again tomorow so I can really appreciate the beauty of its message.  I've only given a handful of movies a five star rating, based on how well it played on my emotions (Close Encounters and Saving Private Ryan are two good examples), and this one is officially added to the list.

","This is painful for me but I'll admit upfront that I haven't seen the original Spanish language film. I'll qualify that by saying I am the type who scoffs at the American re-make of ""The Vanishing"" because it was so inferior to the original. <br/><br/>     I have a hunch that this movie stayed pretty close to the INTENTION of the original. Considering the lame American re-makes usually focus on the ""gimick"" of the original rather than give you any kind of true cultural filter on an original story this is a good thing. I know what Cameron Crowe meant when he said the film wouldn't leave his mind. I had a similar experience with the Russian film ""Come and See"" (which I recommend highly). I kept telling people about it until I convinced a friend to watch it with me. <br/><br/>    I won't give away to much of the plot, because this film is truly a story. When I say story, I mean more like a novel than a comic book. I will say that Tom Cruise did a great job in this film. I don't think Cruise gets enough respect for his acting because he is good-looking and he's a nice guy. Often people's talents get overwhelmed by popularity. Think of some of the most popular people at your high school. Just BECAUSE they were popular didn't a certain segment of the class despise them? Being popular didn't prevent anyone from being a good person (In fact, maybe being popular just allows you more leeway to show your true character.) The whole cast performs at a high level. Penelope Cruz is enchantingly cute. Cameron Diaz is horrifically attractive and menacingly flirty. Jason Lee is able to emote subtleties that evade many more well known and well regarded actors. Most importantly Crowe has forged a good story with crisp dialogue and a frustrating yet authentic vagueness of real life. It's all shot in a slick way without looking too much like a commercial yet with a definite emphasis on story-telling. I recommend the movie to those who aren't afraid to look a little inward and ask some big questions."

It's not that Vanilla Sky was really a huge revelation to me, though I did enjoy it thoroughly. Many of it's plot devices are recycled from other films and at times it seems to be trying too hard to be all things to all people(ie: it's a love story/thriller/mystery/psycho drama/comedy/etc).

This film may even change your life!!... Or than again maybe not, but that's only because I somehow believe we've all become uncapable of even trying to know ourselves and what we want. It's an important realization I came to when seeing this film. </font><br/><br/>David Aames (Cruise) has the life we all think we want, the life he thinks he wants. He's rich, he's handsome, he sleeps with beautiful women, and above all, he lives as he pleases. That is until his luck runs out one day when Julie (Diaz), a women he has casual sex with, purposely drives her car off an overpass with him in it. He does not die, but rather awakens after a month-long coma with his face mangled, and left to live a tortured and tormented life. Gone are his looks, his confidence, his power, but above all he has lost touch with the women he fell in love with one day before the incident... her name is Sofia (you'll adore Penelope Cruz in this part, not to mention believe that a man can fall in ""love"" at first sight).<br/><br/>
Did I have any problems with this movie? Not one. I let it take me where ever it was going and sat there with my eyes open wide (it wasn't just a clever tag line). I took it all in, and at the end let out my feelings in a sigh that seemed to last minutes. Seeing this film triggered something in me. It made me feel as though I, myself had been offered a second chance, much like David (Â‘nuff said, I don't want to spoil this for you). If David ""living the dream"" is what the average Joe out there hopes to achieve, then seeing him lose it all after that crash should help you put things in perspective. This is more than a mere film, from the very first frame to the very last. It is an experience. It is what I feel very few movies, or any at all, achieve, and that is to motivate you to want to somehow change your life, somehow make it better. My saying this may seem a little corny to you, but make no mistake that what I write is exactly how I felt.<br/><br/>I just want to briefly talk about the actors in this film, and the director. Everyone did there job right. The message they carried across to me  is one that we may each see differently, and they leave it all up to us to figure that out. Performances by Tom Cruise, Penelope Cruz, Cameron Diaz, and Jason Lee, are some of the best in each of their respective careers. Cameron Crowe manages to surprise me as I am accustomed to his dramatic-comedies (Jerry Maguire, Almost Famous, Say Anything), but proves here that he can tell a story no matter how large in scope and emotion. In my opinion this is his crowning achievement, one that I fear will be over looked by many.<br/><br/>
""My hearts going boom boom boom""!! The soundtrack for the film which plays throughout really gave the scenes an extra boost. All of those songs are very personal tracks, playing over a very personal story. They are all about lives changing, thoughts changing, or at least that is how I interpreted it. Take for example ""Last Goodbye"" by Jeff Buckley, or ""Everything in its Right Place"" by Radiohead, or even ""Solsbury (check spelling, could be Salsbury Hill) Hill"" by Peter Gabriel, they are all, as I have heard from friends who know these artists far better than me, about turning points in there respective lives. The film plays on that, to the point where you are completely lost and find yourself reflecting on David's life as though it were your own. By the end of the film you find him questioning everything leading to the discovery of what he really wants. <br/><br/>That's about as far as I'm willing to go with an explanation.  You really need to see this for yourself. Do not watch it to try and figure out the ending, or try to figure out who did what and why, because I guarantee that you will not enjoy it. What you must do, and of course this is only my opinion, is just sit down and watch the screen. Let the story unfold. When it's over you will see what I mean, but what that feeling you have at the end is, and how long it lasts, all depends on you. This film will be what you want it to be. Perhaps, so can you."

It is a thinking man's film.  It forces you to follow the story to understand the characters.

I thought the acting was great, the images were breath taking and the sound track first class.  It was a Indi sci-fi classic, with Tom Cruse in the lead and really good music.  My wife thought it was too long, confusing, and and a waste of time.<br/><br/>It must be said that while I love a good Indi film, like say the ""Opposite of Sex"" my wife usually thinks they are too over the top. This film had me going the whole way, first I thought it was a love story, then a murder mystery, then a Psychological thriller, then a sci-fi twister. But the thing I liked most about it was that I could not stop thinking about the film all night.  <br/><br/>The images were burnt into my head.  When I first saw the pictures of the girl and her mother and father I wondered why the parents had blond hair. Later in the film when things changed I said OK that explains that.  But then in the end I did not know what was real and what was a dream, even the ending. I asked my wife what she thought and she said ""Who cares"".  I felt like telling her ""Open you eyes""."

","...of course, there are a slew of wonderful movies out this holiday season, Vanilla Sky may just be the most daring, original, and thought-provoking piece of movie to come along in quite a while.  Not to mention entertaining as hell, which it certainly is. Tom Cruise is a man in search of his life.  And that is about the only thing I'll tell you about the movie.  To say anything more about the plot would either misdirect or confuse, or madden (which is what is so fun about the film).   Crowe has suddenly grown leaps and bounds as a filmmaker of a solid film that not only entertains but questions, enlightens, delves, and frightens.  This is not the kitchy soft focus world of Say Anything, Jerry Maguire, or Almost Famous (all great movies in their own respect).  Rather, this is a dark film, weaving elements of humor, psychological thriller, scathing satire, and sociopolitical parody.  At once, the tone reminded me of another fuzzy director toying with his darkside: Spielberg in last summer's equally intriguing (yet terminally flawed) A.I. Artificial Intelligence.  It's just a shame that both of these films had to draw their dark inspiration from other sources (Spielberg from Kubrick, Crowe from the spanish film Open Your Eyes). Either way, Vanilla Sky is a must see for anyone who likes a challenge. Cruise is amazing in a performance that shines and hones in on his good looks, then does a reversal as his face becomes hideous (you'll see). Cameron Diaz is wonderful as a lovely, yet sad woman.  Jason Lee is great as the unfortunately typecasted sidekick (how many sidekicks can he play?  Who cares: he's damn good at it)  Kurt Russell, one of the great underappreciated workhorses of the biz, is good as always.  And Penelope Cruz has finally earned my respect after several American debacles (did you see Captain Corelli's Mandolin?  You were lucky; I wasn't). But the star of the film is the film itself, and Crowe has finally made his mark as a force to be reckoned with.  Hell, before he pretty much was in a genre corner all of his own: the fluffy feelgood coming of age movies (which I love, and how could one not?)   But now with Vanilla Sky he has a great time moving his camera with the grace of Woo, Cameron, or Scorsese, yet provokes performances like only Crowe could.  As for the music in the picture, it does nothing but enhance every scene.  This movie must be seen and heard to be believed in its genius.  Do yourself a favor.  Stop reading reviews and go out and see it before you learn too much of the plot.  You won't regret it."
"Knona","Null","0","0","15 December 2001"," Great soundtrack, but...
","...not the most entertaining two and a half hours I've ever spent. The music is fantastic; I would never in my wildest dreams think of knocking Crowe's ability to pick a soundtrack. Certainly, he proved his fluency in the language of rock 'n' roll in his semi-autobiographical Almost Famous (highly recommended). Crowe is a director of diverse talents, to be sure, and even his ""teen flick"" (though it was better than the label would suggest) Say Anything was skillfully done. However, the pacing of Vanilla Sky felt very awkward, among other things. The border between fantasy and reality was moved and trampled so many times that it became irrelevant, and this reviewer frequently found herself realizing that she was in a movie theatre watching something on a screen. Crowe's trademark pop culture cameos--the cover of Highway 61 Revisited, characters from To Kill a Mockingbird, etc.--were apparent but somehow ineffectual. By the end of the film, there was little, if any, empathy for Tom Cruise's character, although the scenery was a bit gnawed about the edges. Cameron, make the next one count; I haven't lost my faith in you yet."

For the people who act like those who didnt appreciate the film just didn't get it, well that wasnt the case for me. (SPOILERS) The plot is clearly explained and that was actually what i didnt like.

","this film is not for you if: 1. you were expecting a typical tom cruise holiday release (a no-brainer with a linear plot and hollywood-happy ending). 2. you were expecting cameron crowe to re-visit the idealism of Almost Famous or Say Anything. and let me just clarify, while it does bear some similarities to Lost Highway and (so i've been told) Mullholland Drive, this is NOT a david lynch film.  cameron crowe's directorial style is much less understated than lynch's, and the dialogue and plot allow for more comic moments (most notably from interaction between cruise and jason lee).  in a word, it's not nearly as dark as the typical david lynch faire (with the exception of The Straight Story, of course).  however, this somewhat lighter approach to the psychological thriller is still light-years away from what we have come to expect from cameron crowe.  the opening draws a few parallels to Jerry Maguire (the rich kid with women falling at his feet), but the film quickly shifts to a much more nightmarish tone with the car-crash scene, which in itself was absolutely brutal, in spite (or perhaps because) of the lack of any blood or gore--really the only moment where i wanted to look away.  we then delve into the surreal, sometimes in david's (cruise) dreams, sometimes, more jarringly, in the real world (or what passes for it after his accident and disfigurement).  this is where the most parallels to david lynch-style surrealism can be drawn: what is real?  what is a dream?  what has really happened?  this film manages to be social commentary (investigating our deepest beliefs about life, death, love, technology, the media, our culture and our own minds), yet still hold together as a good STORY.  we care what happens next (and we almost certainly cannot guess...). yes, crowe explains everything (or very nearly) in the last 15 minutes of the movie, but once you know what REALLY happened, it is impossible to ignore the clues that came before.  many well-loved films, including The Sixth Sense, explain everything in their very last moments, but since Vanilla Sky bears a slight resemblance to the films of david lynch, should we (as many reviewers have) expect cameron crowe to leave everything unanswered (like lynch often does)?  my answer is a firm ""no.""  crowe obviously has something bigger than just story in mind here.  see this film for the plot, for the acting and direction, but also see it as a commentary on life."

","Vanilla Sky (5 out of 10) By C.J. Cauley<br/><br/>""Vanilla Sky"" is a remake of a Spanish language film, ""Abre los Ojos"" (Open Your Eyes), that also stars Penelope Cruz.  Tom Cruise, re-teaming with his ""Jerry McGuire"" director, Cameron Crowe, liked the original movie so much, he bought the rights to it in 1999.  ""Vanilla Sky"" is a roller coaster of conspiracy theories and plot twists that will leave your head spinning.  The problem is, once it gets started, your head won't stop spinning for about two and a half hours.  That's how long it takes the new players to act out this facade of a psychological thriller.<br/><br/>Cruise is rich, handsome, disgusting womanizer, David Aames, who loves and leaves one too many women.  The one in question is the beautiful, if slightly psychotic Julie, played by Cameron Diaz.  When David shows an interest in his next conquest who just so happens to be his best friend's girlfriend, Cruz reprising her role as Sofia, she decides it's time for his comeuppance.  Julie hunts him down and drives them both off an overpass into a wall.  The result is a wounded arm, hideous disfigurement and a murder charge for David.  Throw all this and a jealous best friend, Jason Lee, into the mix and you've got what appears to be all the makings of a suspenseful photoplay.  And it is, for a while.<br/><br/>The majority of the movie is told in flashbacks as a masked Cruise pours his heart out to his psychiatrist played by Kurt Russell.  We find out David is an orphan who was left a publishing company.  He has 51% of the company, the board members, who he refers to as the Seven Dwarves, control 49%.  They are in a constant struggle and David is eventually convinced the board is out to get him.  He knows someone set him up for murder.  Was it the board?  Or was it his best friend?  Or the family lawyer?  Or the dead ex-girlfriend?  It couldn't possibly be Sofia, she's too damn cute.  Or maybe, just maybe, he's just plain crazy.  <br/><br/>""Vanilla Sky"" starts out on the right foot.  Cruise reverts back to his days as Maverick in ""Top Gun"" for the first half of the movie.  He's a show boating playboy who flaunts his wealth and goes through women faster than you can say ""one night stand.""  Then, at first glance, he finds someone he can love, someone who can make him a better person.  Who cares if it's his best friend's girl, right?  Sofia is too good to be true.  Her big puppy dog eyes don't hide the fact that she was just as big a push over as the women who came before her.  She falls for his charms instantly and brings him home the same night.  But, Julie isn't quite done with him yet.<br/><br/>After the accident, the best doctors in the world can't put David back together again and he is forced to return to his life not as pretty as he left it but still determined to win the girl of his dreams.  Soon, a six-million-dollar-man team calls and let's David know they can rebuild him. Suddenly he has his face back, his arm miraculously heals and of course he has won over the girl.  That's when the conspiracy theories start flying. David finds himself behind bars not once but twice and discovers he's in way over his head.  ""Vanilla Sky"" features cameos by big name Hollywood talent like Steven Spielberg and a few moments of bliss with the homonym sweethearts, Cruise and Cruz, but the story quickly gets convoluted from there.  <br/><br/>So many conspiracies abound that it's frustrating.  Everyone is a suspect and just when you think you've got it all figured out, you find out you're wrong.  When that happens, once, twice even three times in a movie then the screen writers have done their job.  The problem is ""Vanilla Sky"" does it so often that by the end of the first hour and a half you find yourself begging for the end just so you can find out once and for all what the heck is going on.  They simply go too far and too long with the ""what ifs.""  But that's not the worst part, not by a long shot.  Once they've finally thrown so much out there that you think the movie will absolutely never end, it does. Terribly.  <br/><br/>The ending of ""Vanilla Sky"" didn't just stink, it sucked.  It left me thinking ""I waited two and a half hours for this?!""  With all of the teasing and innuendo you'd think they would have come up with a really clever ending.  Keep thinking.  The best part of this movie was seeing the New York sky line with the World Trade Centers still intact in all of their glory. Even the appeal of the Hollywood ""It"" couple in the cast cannot save the plot from terrible doom.  ""Vanilla Sky"" is great for about an hour and it's good for about another hour.  By then you'll be checking your watch to see when the torture will finally end.  That last half hour lasts for days and winds up leaving a bad taste in your mouth that could linger for years."

After that he slowly starts losing touch with reality in a confusing storyline that eventualy comes together at the end. Cruise is actualy quite good in the film, playing someone who can no longer rely on his looks and charm to get by..

"Jaymay","Null","0","0","15 December 2001"," Reviewing the reviewers
","To quote Mel Brooks:  ""Critics are like eunuchs at an orgy.  They just don't get it.""<br/><br/>It really p***es me off when people trash an ambitious, thought-provoking movie like Vanilla Sky.  They do it because it makes them feel important. Anyone can trash Tomcats, right?  But if you can bash Cameron Crowe, you must be REALLY smart.<br/><br/>People put out this bad buzz, and then the ambitious movies don't make as much money, and then we end up with theaters full of Scary Movie III and Dude Where's My Car.  Oh joy.<br/><br/>To the people who call this movie ""unfocused"":  Look, you cretins.  This is an ambitious film.  It blurs the traditional lines between fantasy and reality, it leaves you hanging in limbo for much longer than you're used to. Most movies tell you exactly what to think.  Vanilla Sky leaves you guessing.  Calling this movie ""unfocused"" is another way of saying ""I need to be spoon fed the plot!  I'm a cinematic toddler!""  Go watch Legally Blonde and talk about how cute Reese is in her argyle sweater and leave this movie alone.<br/><br/>To those who said Vanilla Sky is full of bad acting:  Excuse me?  I'm sorry, but it is an absolute travesty that Cuba Gooding, Jr., Anna Paquin, Jack Palance and Marisa Tomei have acting Oscars, and Tom Cruise doesn't.  He's a great talent, no question.  He takes chances.  He plays strange, even unlikeable roles, and he's not afraid.  We need to give him his Oscar, because there's a bit of desperation creeping in to his recent work--as if he's doing acting backflips to get respect.  Penelope Cruz is gorgeous and likeable.  Cameron Diaz could get by on just being HOT.  But she doesn't. She takes roles in Being John Malkovich, and Vanilla Sky, and she even elevated her character in Best Friend's Wedding.  Brava, Cammie.<br/><br/>To those who say the movie is too long:  I'm sorry, but when Pearl Harbor comes in at 3 hours, I think I can forgive Vanilla Sky for being 135 minutes (not 150, as a million reviewers have incorrectly stated).  As if all of you geniuses who have time to write reviews on IMDB can't spare an extra 15 minutes.<br/><br/>To those who say ""it's not as good as Almost Famous"":  Whatever.  In two years you'll be trashing Crowe's next movie and talking about how brilliant Vanilla Sky was.<br/><br/>I'm not saying people have to love everything.  It's fine to have high standards.  But don't trash a movie that aims high and doesn't quite reach the stars, or you'll end up with a bunch of middle-of-the-road pap.<br/><br/>Thank God there are a few American directors left that still have enough confidence to take chances and make us think:  Wes Anderson, Ang Lee, and Cameron Crowe.  And Tarantino, if he ever directs again.<br/><br/>Vanilla Sky:  8.0/10.0   Critics:  0.0/10.0"

","Abre Los Ojos, the original film this movie is based on, was made<br/><br/>a couple of years before The Matrix (yet, premiered in the States in<br/><br/>1999 as well), it was a well balanced murder-thriller with a bit of<br/><br/>the existential matters, and what-is-real questions the Matrix<br/><br/>unintentionally address. No wonder it found fans here in the U.S.,<br/><br/>like Tom Cruise, but unfortunately, what happens in every<br/><br/>European film that is translated into an American movie (with the<br/><br/>exception of The Birdcage, and maybe Scent of a Woman) the U.S.<br/><br/>version always falls short. Mainly because they're usually<br/><br/>dumbed-down for American consumption (Point of No Return, The<br/><br/>Vanishing to name a couple).<br/><br/>But not Vanilla Sky, which is actually done by a good director. The<br/><br/>problem with Vanilla Sky is that the director makes a mess out of<br/><br/>the original script, indulging too much on parts of it not meaningful<br/><br/>to the story, a cool soundtrack and maybe assuming people saw<br/><br/>the first so he could play with this one. The result is a confusing<br/><br/>film that doesn't know where it wants to go.<br/><br/>(Spoiler alert) <br/><br/>A key element of the plot is the concept of cryogenics, which is not<br/><br/>something so complicated to explain as seen in Abre Los Ojos,<br/><br/>and this year's A.I., Artificial Intelligence. It's not new, and it's even<br/><br/>practiced in real life. Somehow Vanilla Sky makes a lousy job<br/><br/>explaining it, calling it ""Life Extension"" and a lot of chit chat about a<br/><br/>defrosted dog that has little to do with the idea (storing your body in<br/><br/>a freezer for a future when a cure for your disease is found). I<br/><br/>repeat: this is a key element of the plot. You make this confusing;<br/><br/>the whole movie gets more difficult to understand. This was not<br/><br/>only the only thing messed up to make the plot more confusing.<br/><br/>The original kept the audience on the edge, making it wonder to<br/><br/>the very end if the weird stuff going on is a nightmare, or the main<br/><br/>character has really gone wacko. Vanilla Sky goes for the<br/><br/>""nightmare"" theory, which leaves some parts unexplained (like why<br/><br/>the main character prefers to be interrogated with his mask on),<br/><br/>again, making it confusing.<br/><br/>I'm still surprised though the remake didn't work. The casting was<br/><br/>excellent, New York City as the setting is perfect, the soundtrack,<br/><br/>as in any Crowe film, kicks butt, and the story is faithful to the<br/><br/>original in many ways. The confusing stuff is what made it a<br/><br/>disaster at the end."

","I just saw Vanilla sky. As I walked out of the theater, I realized just how stupid American audiences have been trained to be. With craptacular hits like The Lost World : Jurassic Park, and the new Star Wars movies in the top ten grossing movies of all time, people can't accept a movie that is new and different (Even if it is adapted). Maybe this is why no one goes to see the Coen Brothers' movies.<br/><br/>I'm glad that Tom Cruise is in it. Let's not think about his wonderful and true performance, but rather his drawing power. He has the power to bring audiences to a movie, no matter what it is. Thanks to his star power, I think this movie will gross a lot of dough, even with it's strange content. This means, perhaps, that the producers of this movie will let Crowe make more films. Maybe we're witnessing the birth of one of the great writers of American film.<br/><br/>Then again, that's me. Maybe the movie is ""Stupid"" and maybe you ""Have to be on drugs to understand it"". But maybe not. Maybe the teenage girls that ""didn't like it because he was ugly"" aren't the best critics of movies. I don't think so at least."

","This is just my never humble personal opinion but: Tom Cruise as an actor is completely overrated. So he was okay in Jerry Mc... big deal. How on Earth did this guy become so hugely talented all of a sudden? Would it be the fact that his ""Sexiest Man of the Year"" award had something to do with it? Is it his supposed ""good looks""? To me the guy has some 3 facial expressions and a ""broken nose look"". I really cannot understand the hype. Same goes for the Spanish actress who obviously had to practice a lot to be understood in the movie as her English is terrible (how corny- those foreign characters always being sweet, sincere and all). Diaz isn't too hard to look at but her character in this movie wasn't as developed as it should have been. And let's face it: her acting range is still somewhat limited. So far for trashing the people who made millions acting in this movie... The movie itself screams pretentiousness.

Lots of good stuff old and new.  Many striking scenes to go with the music.  Peter Gabriel's ""Solsbury Hill"" is one of my favorites.  Unfortunately the dialogue obscured most of the lyrics (granted, they didn't have much to do with the plot, but as a fan I wanted to hear the song).<br/><br/>This may be a SPOILER but the film reminded me of ""Total Recall"" and ""Dark City""--the sci fi elements were perhaps a little unwelcome.

","-contains spoilers-<br/><br/>Quite honestly, I was surprised by this film. For some odd reason, Tom Cruise keeps displaying the semblance of acting ability. While Penelope Cruz felt awkward and sometimes out of place, her presence in the film brought an interesting contrast between her and Cameron Diaz. The grounded and self actualized brunette versus the out of touch and promiscuous blonde. Score one for the lovely brunettes of the world! Anyway, the dialogue gave up too much of the ending too early in the film. In my opinion, if the screen writer had made the messages more subtle and cryptic, this would certainly would be a classic in the sense of The Crying Game or The Sixth Sense. Also, I must commend John Toll for his amazing photography. I didn't even recognize his work in the fast paced world of within this film. And one last note, the music, cinematography and the action was amazing at the end of the film when Cruise finally makes his leap of faith."

","A Bright Vanilla Sky<br/><br/>
People like to dream or even just imagine their perfect life. It is such an intense moment when that happens, that the person can't even realize whether he is dreaming or not. The new Cameron Crowe movie Vanilla Sky shows this fact in a more complicated, but sophisticated way. This movie is a remake of the Spanish movie Abre Los Ojos (Open Your Eyes) directed by Alejandro Amenabar. It is innovative and existential; it is hard to understand, and that is what intimidated the critics who brought it down.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise stars as rich and successful David Aames who unexpectedly finds his true love with a very pleasant Spanish lady. What becomes his problem is the fact that he loves being liked; that is what makes him enter the car of friendly-but-barmy Julie Gianni (Cameron Diaz) who has more than a crush on him. It is just this little mistake that ruins all of David's life. When he realizes that his life completely crumbled, all he wants is to find out one way to fix it all up. The protagonist then has to make it through a series of odd situations, some of which turn out to be just dreams. David's life is now separated into dream and reality, and when those two will end up joining in a `pause mode,' things will become clear to him.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise produced this New York-based movie with associate Paula Wagner and writer/director Cameron Crowe (whom he has worked with in Jerry Maguire). Crowe (Jerry Maguire, Almost Famous) changes his style by giving the movie lots of more energy compared to his old works. In the middle of all this desperation, he gives it a little sarcasm making it more controversial. Penelope Cruz plays the girl of David's dreams; she gives a normal performance, nothing special. Instead, with her right energetic performance, Cameron Diaz got nominated for a Golden Globe, but didn't win it. After all the foolish comedies she has done, finally she was chosen to play a more complicated character that reflected all of her talent. Kurt Russell completed a great performance playing David Aames' psychiatrist. He might even get nominated for some award, but his part doesn't give him enough possibilities to react and give more vitality. Tom Cruise didn't do a bad job; he did too many of his ironical laughs while shaking his head. Making himself  `look bad' in this movie, might create an admiring reaction in some people.<br/><br/>Vanilla Sky is a pretty disturbing movie while watching it, but not anymore when it has ended. It has been constructed in a way to confuse the spectator; the effect of that, is that once you have understood the whole story, you feel extremely satisfied. That is what the director wanted to accomplish; and he did.<br/><br/>Rating: ****"

","I have never seen a movie like it.  I know that it was not necessarily a unique idea because of the original version.  However, the story itself was unique and I absolutely loved it.  I think anyone who thought it was rubbish or garbage is obviously just not bright enough to grasp the concept or realize the message that lies within the story.  As Penelope Cruz's character, Sophia comments, ""Every passing moment, is a chance to turn it all around.""  The movie is about life and falling in love and how great things can be if you allow it to happen and that even though mistakes will be made and sometimes people get hurt, no one is perfect.  You can always change the negative things that surround you-your attitude about life, love, the way in which you treat others, etc.-if you really want to.  You don't have to die to begin a new life or start a clean slate.  It also ""opens your eyes"" to many different subjects such as, the way women feel about men who are sexual shoplifters.  I think Camron Diaz did a fabulous job of showing you just how much it hurts to be in love with someone who never had any intention of ever being with you for any other reason than a place to store his genitalia.  And for that matter, how bad a feeling as strong as love can screw wtih your emotions to a point where love becomes obsession and can literally drive you right over the edge.  And while I am definitely not the biggest Tom Cruise fan around, I applaud is portrayal of the main character, David, a young man who is confused about his life, his fortune and what he thinks love means to him.  On a psychological level, this film is fantastic. I never guessed what the reality of the movie was at any point.  I was completely surprised by the ending and could not have felt more satisfied when I left the theater, although many of the moviegoers around me were whispering how confused they were as they walked toward the exit.  I couldn't give this movie anything less than a perfect 10."

","Cameron Crowe began his working life sensationally, as a reporter for Rolling Stone magazine at the tender age of 16. His films to date have all been worthy of merit but also suffered from a childish sentimental overload. Ironically with his last film, Almost Famous, a sentimental semi true portrait of Crowe's early reporting days, the director threatened to grow up, creating an enjoying offering of rock and roll life style. Now it seems with his latest film Vanilla Sky, Crowe has finally become a man. A remake of the thriller by Alejandro AmenÃ¡bar, it concerns David Aames (Tom Cruise), a wealthy 30-year-old who has inherited daddy's magazine empire. He spends his days speeding around the streets of New York in a Ford Mustang and his nights cavorting with the sexy but slightly disturbing Julie Gianni played excellently by Cameron Diaz. Aames's yuppie life is turned upside down when he meets the engaging Sofia (Penelope Cruz). His life then takes a much more dramatic turn when he is involved in a car crash. That's the coherent part of the film. The plot then dives into surrealism head on, as Aames can't define what's real and what is a dream, as the remainder of the film is told through flashback. Visually, the film makes much of the premise of a dream world with short parts of events flashed up on screen with Aames in various situations, and the seeds of curiosity grow. Cruise is exceptionally good as the tortured and confused Aames and is helped by a tremendous supporting cast. The English actor Timothy Spall is under-used in a loyal butler type role and the now seldom seen Kurt Russell also proves his worth as a caring psychologist. And then there's Penelope Cruz. She plays her part well, is beautiful and she speaks with a quirky pseudo-Spanish accent. That's it. The film does have several shortcomings. Crowe's obsession with Cruise yes, that's Cruise not the beautiful female Cruz, is slightly worrying. As with the actor/director pair's previous film, Jerry Maguire, Cruise and his shiny white teeth appear in almost every frame of the film. Every other scene is a one-minute pop video, gelling music and visuals to an exhausting extent and suggesting this film is targeted solely at the MTV generation. However due to a strong cast, a grown-up director and Cameron Diaz's legs, Vanilla Sky offers food for thought and certainly justifies the ticket price."

","A film which makes an attempt to pattern itself on the fantasy vs. reality films that had become popular at the turn of the new millennium - David Fichner's ""Fight Club"" and M. Night Shamalan's ""Sixth Sense"" both from 1999, Christopher Nolan's ""Momento"" from 2000, and David Lynch's ""Mulholland Drive"" released the following year (all of which don't surpass the reigning king of this genre when Terry Gilliam released his 1985 masterpiece ""Brazil"") - by no means fails in this respect since I found it both entertaining and intriguing for the most part, but is noticeably long and certainly may confuse the average '2hr-max-movie-goer'. Penelope Cruz and Cameron Diaz both stand out playing their respective, 'good gal/bad gal roles and Jason Lee is quite appealing as the best friend of our dashing lead Tom Cruise. Yet Cruise may be viewed as stretching this performance given the physical challenges that are demanded. I hesitate to reveal these challenges to those that have not seen the picture as they are indeed the focal point of the plot. Many good things like the witty Cameron Crowe retrospective soundtrack that is weaved into clever culture references and tributes which are indeed enjoyable and even necessary to solve the riddle presented in 'what's is going on?' scenario of the main character's pressing dilemma which may not be easy to access with a single viewing. But still the ride can be entertaining as Tom runs away and into trouble as he often does in quasi-action films that are laced with mystery and intrigue like Sydney Pollack's 1993 ""The Firm"", Brian De Palma's 1996 ""Mission Impossible"" and even the more cerebrally dark, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" from Stanley Kubrick. As noted by many educated critics as well as the tasteless tabloids Mr. Cruise may be biting off more than he can chew as he dives into the land of independent production. I applaud Tom for his efforts and are rooting for his 'comeback' yet do believe that his choice for future roles should include a return to comedic territory as a deviation/diversion to selecting elaborate/complicated efforts which could be prove a bit too risky and result in a poor reception at the box office."
"Glida","4","0","0","14 December 2001"," Good intentions, noble failure
","I was rooting for this film.  Cameron Crowe has made some of the best American commercial films in the last two decades, an oeuvre that includes: Fast times at Ridgemont High; Say Anything (arguably one of the best teen films ever made); Jerry Maguire; and the celebratory Almost Famous.  As always, Crowe was working with some of the best talents in the industry, including cinematographer John Toll (The Thin Red Line; Almost Famous) and a cast that included Tom Cruise, Penelope Cruz, Cameron Diaz, Kurt Russell (who hardly resembles Elvis here), Timothy Spall, Jason Lee, and a small part by the always remarkable Tilda Swinton.<br/><br/>
So, what the hell went wrong?<br/><br/>
In the film, Tom Cruise plays a CEO of a large corporation who is involved on a ""friend/lover"" basis with Cameron Diaz.  When he wakes up at the beginning of the movie, he hears Penelope Cruz's character telling him to wake up.  He does, and drives to Manhattan, which is totally devoid of people.  Then, he wakes up again....it was a dream.....only to hear Cameron Diaz's voice waking him.  Later, he meets Penelope Cruz's character at a party, accompanied by Jason Lee's character, who is Cruise's best friend. The chemistry between Cruise and Cruz is immediate.<br/><br/>
At this point, VS takes off into a variety of directions involving various time shifts, including a car accident with the now stalking Diaz character which leaves her dead and Cruise horribly facially disfigured.  In an overlapping thread, he is charged with a murder, although the discourse doesn't let on exactly who he was alleged to have killed.  The leit motif of the movie is to ""wake up,"" as Cruise desperately tries to get clear about what is happening to him, what has happened to him, and where the tsunami of circumstances is taking him.  Eventually, he begins to question the very nature of his reality as he experiences his interpersonal, internal, and physical life collapsing at every turn.<br/><br/>
Vanilla Sky is the latest addition to the '01 dreamscape genre following the absorbing noir Memento (not a dream, but plays like one), and two brilliant entries:  David Lynch's hypnotic and enigmatic Mulholland Drive; and the compelling Richard Linklater film, Waking Life.   These last three films are some of the finest movies of the year (all on my best 10 list), and a cross comparison with VS reveals a great deal.<br/><br/>
Two of these better cinematic entries possess a cohesive center.  Even though Memento is a precise exercise in non-linearity, the film presents a strong central character with a connecting plot thread:  he has lost his short term memory, and is trying to go back in time to solve a murder. Waking Life takes its protagonist on a clear line of interactions with remarkable people.  The film-maker's reality comes to us at the same time as the protagonist's, which gives us the sense that we are journeying together with the dreamer.  Mulholland Drive appears to make no sense and would seem to suffer from the same problems as VS, but Lynch's cinematography is so mesmerizing, the acting so compelling, the writing so damn brilliant, the scenes so unforgettable, and so incomprehensively real and surreal, that it works anyway.....arguably, it might be the best film of the year.<br/><br/>
But VS possesses a plot structure that keeps jerking the audience around; the discourse becomes increasingly incomprehensible which leaves the audience with a strained ability to relate to the characters and keep up with the capricious plot changes to the point where the audience becomes exhausted past the point of caring.  And the payoff, when it comes, seems weak and tacked on.  Ultimately, the ending  rearranges the film's tone and meaning which reduces it from an overly confused non-linearity to a trivial mess with a ""feel good"" message that seems even more pretentious and contrived than Spielberg's false endings in ""A.I.""<br/><br/>
I'm reminded of a story involving James Stewart when he was originally offered to play Scotty in Hitchcock's Vertigo.  Initially, Stewart turned down the first draft of the script because he felt that the film had nothing to ground it in reality.  But, when Samuel Taylor rewrote the script and included Midge (Barbara Bel Geddes), Stewart was said to exclaim, ""Now we have a picture!"" because he correctly realized that now the film had a center that would give the audience a hook....someone with whom they could relate as the action became increasingly surreal and strange.  That, I believe, is the central problem with VS, which offers the viewer no center, and therefore no hope of maintaining verisimilitude.  Any connection the audience might hope to establish with the movie vanishes long before the film-makers flash the final credits.<br/><br/>
**1/2 stars for me (despite the problems) for the good performances, the look of the film, Crowe's good intentions (a noble failure), and the fact that any film is automatically improved that involves Tilda Swinton."

","Because the plot of Abre Los Ojos was so strong, it's difficult to give this movie a terrible rating.  I still enjoyed it and appreciated the romance and found it to be strangely magical in an urban kind of way.  However, Vanilla Sky takes too many cues from Hollywood -- most prominently the utter lack of subtlety by which Abre Los Ojos was crafted.  (slight spoiler)  The cryogenics theme is introduced too blatantly, and it's spelled out in mindnumbing detail later in the movie.  Tom Cruise's character is immediately stereotyped, whereas the protagonist in Abre Los Ojos had a playboy role that was more difficult to grapple with.  Just like the color of Vanilla Sky versus Abre Los Ojos, everything is sharper, less ambiguous, and... louder!  The music for the ""derangement"" scenes were all-out annoying and inappropriate, and seemed to last far too long.<br/><br/>I'm glad this movie was released, if only to prompt its viewers to watch the clearly superior original.

Finally once you get to the end it's nicely explained and wrapped up for you... or is it?.  The one thing that shocked me was her voice at the end. It was incongruous.  It made no sense.  What does make sense, at least to me is that he fell asleep on her couch and everything between that moment and the last scene was a nightmare.  He was stressed out, being stalked and was already prone to nightmares, as shown in the first moments of the film. his guilt over shafting his friend (with P cruz), and the shabby way he treated his casual partner plus the creepy images and concepts of cryogenics make a perfect pot to make such a twisted dream.<br/><br/>When his eye opens to P cruz's voice in the last moment, when you expect some vision of doctors and the future, it's the final kicker.  Like the punchline of a brilliant joke.  I fooled you is what Crowe is saying. The over explained ending which everyone calls ""hollywood"" and over done was nothing more then a trap for those not paying attention to the brilliant understated second of film at the end!  What a kicker!<br/><br/>I don't usually post to these sort of forums but I felt by the sheer volume of people that went into this film expecting Hollywood, then came out complaining about it being confusing, and claiming that it was too Hollywood!

Cruise just comes off as unlikeable before and after his character's transformations, though his fears are comprehensible, and the ending was a cop-out. It would have been more plausible (and more interesting) if he had killed his lover in a rage thinking she was the girl who had ruined his face (and life), and how he would deal with it.

Cameron Crowe gives us a message that will melt your heart in so many ways but I'm not going to spoil it for you because the trailer doesn't tell you anything.

It's a roller coaster all the way and if Russell Crowe gets nominated for an Oscar, I think Tom Cruise will be great competition. Please see it."

","This movie had all the right elements for a great movie.  Unfortunately it didn't live up to the trailers.  You have to wonder if the director and producers actually watch this movie before they release it.  What they should have done was let the company that created the great looking trailer re-edit this film.  This might go down as one of the worst films of the year.  Not too many films actually illicit groans from the audience when they finish but this film managed to alienate the entire theater.<br/><br/>

","It's a shame that people do not like to be challenged when they go to the movies. Judging by the reasons people did not like the film, that is why. There are a lot of people that prefer connect the dots type movies. Vanilla Sky is definately not one of those type movies. It's one of those movies that should be viewed more than once to really appreciate it. The movie did really well at the box office (100 million) so maybe that's what happened.<br/><br/>The first time you see this movie, it keeps you off balance. It keeps you asking..""Why is this happening? Why is that happening?"". And then when things are explained then everything that happened before makes perfect sense. Then you realize that if you had paid close attention, there were hints throughout the movie at what was going on and where the movie was heading. It was one of those films that i really appreciated more as it was winding up. I have seen the movie more than once and have liked it more each time I have seen it. And I am not the only one that thinks that. I know people that either didn't like the movie the first time they saw it or came out feeling so-so about it but saw it a second time and absolutely loved it.<br/><br/>
Everybody in the film does a great job. Tom Cruise plays the rich boy whose life goes into the crapper, perfectly. And he makes you really feel for him when he is trying to cope with his situation after the accident. Cameron diaz is great. The scene in the car with Tom actually gives you chills up your spine. Penelope Cruz is great as Tom's ""ideal"" woman and you can see why they hooked up off screen. The chemistry between them is definately there. Jason lee is great as Tom's best friend as well. And as usual with any cameron crowe movie, the music in the film is great and adds tremendously to the entire movie.<br/><br/>This movie has everything.It has romance, humor, suspense, heartbreak, and just plain mindbending stuff.<br/><br/>For those of you who did not care for the movie the first time, give the movie another chance. I think you might change your mind.<br/><br/>Cameron Crowes streak of good movies continues."

Why, if LE are so secretive, did they let Aames and his escorts in?<br/><br/>At first I expected that some or all of these questions would be left ambiguous even at the end - why should everything be given to us on a plate?<br/><br/>But after the scene where Aames (Cruise) wakes up in the middle of the night and looks in the mirror, I had begun to fear having nightmares (OK, I'm embarrassed, but I don't go to the movies very often). So I hoped that all would be explained, to let me get a good night's sleep.<br/><br/>In short, it was all explained and I got a good night's sleep.

Plus, no disrespect to Noah (""Shine"") Taylor, surely such expositions are traditionally given by older, avuncular, gravelly-voiced, English-accented figures? (1 out of 4 for Noah.) POSSIBLE SPOILER: And surely his character should have been billed as ""Tech Support""!<br/><br/>Why does Jason Lee's character more than once burst out in criticism of Aames' behaviour, rather than trying patiently to help him as a friend? Arguably, this is also explained by the ending (I won't spoil by saying how), but it irritated me as I was watching (whereas the flashbacks, dream sequences and the long introduction did not). I guess the real answer is that you are to infer that the ""friendship"" bit has happened on many previous occasions, off camera, as it were, but that doesn't make for good cinema, so is omitted in a kind of cinematographic shorthand. But it unfortunately only reminded me of certain British and Australian soap operas where arguments and misunderstandings happen at every turn.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I think (or I thought) the ending tied everything up just too tidily.

"rankinrip","6","0","0","14 February 2002"," Cruise fumbles the lead...
","Cameron Crowe is a great director and as always he managed to maximize the sensory experience through visuals and an amazing soundtrack.  But writer/director Alejandro Amenábar (""The Others"") is no slouch himself and Crowe demonstrates his respect by taking the original script almost for gospel and by using many of the same shots such as the ones in the disco club and on top of the roof in the finale.  In my opinion, the remake falls substantially short of the original, because of the limited development of the central character.  The original was played by a very talented Spanish actor, Eduardo Noriega (""The Devil's Backbone""), who did a great job paralleling his internal change with the external one.  The key underpinning of the entire movie is that the audiece believe that this rich, cocky womanizer falls fast and hard for Cruz and realizes in one night that he will never be the same.  But just as quickly everything is taken from him in a cruel twist of fate and when he finally appears to have regained his lost love, the audience's heart is ripped right out of their chests when they realize that all is an illusion.  But Cruise just forced it so damn badly that you never believed he really fell for this girl that night.  He flashes her a smile, so he's in love?  He flashed the same damn smile at Diaz though.  So why does he love Cruz over Diaz?  Diaz is just as attractive and she speaks English a hell of a lot better.  There was no transition or juxtaposition that made the audience think ""Wow, this little Spanish girl really knocked his socks off.""  As a result, he makes Penelope Cruz look like a poser.  Not her fault at all though.  Similarly, Jason Lee was supposed to be his weaker, ordinary looking, little brother buddy, but Cruise comes across as weaker of the two friends in their scenes together. Noriega just made much better choices.  From the opening scene, he makes it clear that he generally disdains women.  They are a trophy, similar to his money and his cars.  Cruise just plays the opening scene with the same ""$hit-eating grin"" waving to every secretary in the office as he wanders the halls of the company that he owns like a drunken party boy and a moron. He plays his character like Adam Sandler played ""Billy Madison"".  Despite being the lead of the movie, he seems to take no control over his conflicts."

A terrible terrible terrible finale.<br/><br/>During the first and second acts, the film poses questions about vanity, sanity, morality and reality, and answers them with the modern equivalent of the oldest cliche ending in the book - ""it was all a dream"" for the 21st century. The dream is replaced with a ridiculous science fiction get-out which has no relevance to the preceding film. And the resulting subject matter of virtual reality and cryogenics has been done better, with more point, more depth and more humour on TV drama and sit-coms for the last 15 years.

","By chance I saw 'Open Your Eyes' just a month or so ago- and was rather nonplussed as I had been with 'The Others'. Not a bad idea, but nothing compared to 'Eraserhead', 'Lost Highway', 'Memento', 'The Matrix','Videodrome', 'Existenz' or 'Mulholland Drive' (which i saw at the Birmingham film festival a few weeks prior). Someone mentioned 'Total Recall'- this is right- in that it is Philip K. Dick. 'Total Recall' emanates from 'We Can Remember it for You Wholesale'- which shares many themes of Dick's fiction concering the reality of reality. Such books as 'Now Wait for Last Year', 'Ubik', 'A Scanner Darkly' & 'Valis' do this thing much more eloquently. Ditto the works of William's Burroughs and Gibson on a similar theme.<br/><br/>So, a remake of an average original by Cameron Crowe- a good rock writer and a talented film-maker- should he really be doing a sf-thriller when he is most famous for romantic-comedies? Did Alfred Hitchcock make 'Two Lane Blacktop'?<br/><br/>The advert looked great- a mixture of 'A Clockwork Orange' and the ideas for the original with a stellar cast. The film was, in actuality, a ponderous 2 1/2 hour affair. There was too much music- some of it worked: Radiohead's 'Everything...', the Sigur Ros. Though why was Jeff Buckley's 'Last Goodbye' only slightly played at the point of David & Sofia's last goodbye (well, not actually) prior to the car crash? This film has too much of a budget, the talked-up Times Square sequence was not the visual overload I was expecting. The everything is available ethos of Aames character is equally applicable to Crowe's film; the Coltrane illusion made me want to vomit. It is unlikely that Aames would leave Diaz's character for the underwritten love-epiphany with Sofia (Penelope Cruz, looking somewhat cosmetically enhanced from her appearance in the original and films like 'Jamon Jamon' and  'All About My Mother')...The 'Jules et Jim' references are tedious and don't quite fit- I take it the freeze-frame love scene is meant to be an allusion to the classic Truffaut film? The Dylan cover thing was quite intelligent, though 'Almost Famous' did a similar thing with the cover to Neil Young's 'Time Fades Away'...The supporting cast is good- Timothy Spall, Kurt Russell, Noah Taylor, Tilda Swinton. Though the use of the divine Alicia Witt as a mere receptionist is depressing- she would have made a great Sofia! The Spielberg cameo was another irritating facet- did he carry a poster for 'Minority Report'? (the upcoming Philip K Dick adaptation with Cruise)...This film was overlong, poorly rewritten and ultimately ponderous. Crowe should get back to making films like 'Almost Famous', 'Jerry MaGuire' and 'Singles'. Cruise should forget about attempting to make arthouse films and consider 'MI 3'...What could have been one of the films of the year is a big, big letdown- and chucking multiple examples of pop culture at the screen won't save it."

THIS IS DEFINITELY A SPOILER (depending how you look at it, of course)----<br/><br/><br/><br/>I watched this movie last night and in the wee hours of the morning I really did have a  dream which turned into a quasi nightmare.  Now the funny thing is, immediately after I woke up, ---with my heart pounding, it immediately came to me a possible interpretation of what  might have happened in this movie.  However, the director probably made it so that there could be several interpretations. . .<br/><br/>The director is not asking us to stretch our incredulity, but just the opposite-- he is asking us to trust our common sense.  In fact, this might be a hard film to translate to American audiences because of American optimism!  He is asking you to shake your head in disbelief at a lot more than the sci-fi parts! and then trust and use that knowledge to figure out the movie!<br/><br/>This movie actually has a great deal of humor. I'll explain later.<br/><br/>
In the very opening sequence, before the ""Times Square"" scene, before we even see Tom Cruise--- shot during the opening credits,  there is a sequence of flying, from the viewpoint of the person doing the flying. Tom is already dreaming.  Isn't flying a common dream subject?<br/><br/>Then we see him in bed.  He's dreaming that he is waking up, twice, in fact. In this dream He's Incredibly handsome (in fact he looks like Tom Cruise!) He has a fabulous high-powered job, that he didn't have to slave for, he is fabulously wealthy (In reality he's just a poor, average looking commoner like most of us), he has a beautiful woman in his bed, a space-age high tech television in his bedroom--- also, a red Ferrari, going down an empty Times Square, then some other fabulous vehicle ---- Obviously he's dreaming (Obvious To everyone except maybe Warren Buffet and Bill Gates).  Like I say, American audiences might have trouble seeing the outlandishness of the non sci-fi  things.  But in the viewpoint of the maker of this movie, outlandish they are.<br/><br/>In reality, his wife or girlfriend (who probably doesn't look anything like Penelope or Cameron --- How many men dream of their wives/girlfriends, when they're actually dreaming? . . .) is watching television in bed while he is sleeping.  He incorporates things being said on the TV into his dream. Haven't you ever done that?  When he starts to toss and turn in bed because his dream is turning into a nightmare, his wife/girlfriend ---whoever--- tries to wake him.  I think he had two nightmares. . .  the first one was when he was flying (he's afraid of heights, and is looking down) and that is when we first hear her voice, she  is trying to gently wake him from his nightmare.  This is the voice we hear when we first hear ""open your eyes"". He doesn't wake, but it causes his dream to shift.  The TV is still playing in reality, hence the weird background noises throughout the movie.  He ""morphs"" the ""cryogenics"" commerical in his dream. . . She is trying to wake him gently.  ""open your eyes""  she says several times in the movie.  Both Penelope and Cameron are his ""dream girls"" but his wife's voice is real. . .<br/><br/>
At the very end of the movie, he's waking up from his nightmare.  His wife says ""Relax, open your eyes. . ."" (Again, his wife probably doesn't look anything like Penelope Cruz) and we see one eye open.  His skin has a sweaty sheen to it and the light of the bedside lamp is shining on his face. He's been awakened.<br/><br/>One humorous part is when he is dreaming that Cameron is telling how great he is in bed, and that he had sex four times in one night (not saying that this is impossible, just seems like a dream aspect).<br/><br/>The movie also had a message within it, too.  But that's may take for now. I think I will see it again."

Is he a murderer or a victim of a set up? Who knows? More relevantly, who really cares? If Aames seems thoroughly bewildered by what is happening to him, maybe you'd be confused if you had to choose between making love four times a night to someone like Diaz and having an idyllic relationship with someone like Cruz.<br/><br/>
The movie  a remake of the 1997 Spanish work `Open Your Eyes'  tries hard to be clever and original and has some memorable scenes with Cruise often looking like the `Phantom Of The Opera', but it only partly succeeds, leaving me at least more than a little perplexed. In short, no more than B+."

","I CANNOT believe that Cameron Crowe gave himself such a huge writing credit on this film (written for the screen by ...) The night I went to see Vanilla Sky, Abre Los Ojos was being broadcast on television so I had the chance to watch one immediately after the other. Some scenes in Vanilla Sky are a word for word copy from the original, the only significant difference apart from more expensive sets, was that the David Aames character had been sanitised into a much nicer guy who happens to have women problems and (hey, it is a Tom Cruise movie) issues with his father.<br/><br/>However the main reason I found Vanilla Sky so boring was that the crux of the film, which is supposed to motivate you to unflinchingly sit through this 2+ hours of teeth and hairspray, is the undying love that Sofia inspires with such kooky bon-mots as:<br/><br/>'I'll tell you in another life when we're both cats', 'I believe if you're a good person good things will happen', 'Every minute is another chance to turn it all around'<br/><br/>I mean, please, buy any 3.99 self-help book and save yourself the bother.<br/><br/>Just in case there's any doubt - those lines belong to Vanilla Sky alone."

","This is a pathetic movie, for two reasons:<br/><br/>a) having seen Amenabar's original ""Abre Los Ojos"" before ""Vanilla Sky"", one can see, after just a few minutes, that the american version just isn't going to reach the depth, simplicity and elegance of the original. This movie falls prey to the temptation of big-star movies where everybody's handsome and apparently dressed by Vogue's fashion coordinators. The story, of course, suffers. It's a pity that 90% of movie-goers will get to know this story as told by Crowe and not by Amenabar.<br/><br/>b) Penelope Cruz just isn't a good actress. It's amazing that she'd agree to play the exact same part in the remake. Did she count on nobody knowing Amenaber's version? (Curiously i have to admit that Tom Cruise plays the part with the delicacy and intensity it deserves, and I don't even like him...). It seems as if Crowe bowed before the Cruz-Cruise soap opera and let her do whatever she wanted. Contrast with her part in Almodovar's ""Todo sobre mi madre"", and you'll get a glimpse of what a good director can do even with mediocre actress material.<br/><br/>Was this a trade-off between Cruise amd Amenabar? (i.e. ""I'll produce ""The Others"" if you give me the right to remake your Penelope movie""?).<br/><br/>Please..."

","An adaptation of Alejandro Amenábar's narcissist's nightmare ""Abre los Ojos"", it's like a cross between The Matrix, Total Recall, and Fatal Attraction, only this production takes the worst-common-denominator of the three. That they were good films with creative ideas and vivid characters is what keeps Vanilla Sky above water, but won't likely be appreciated by a more sophisticated audience.<br/><br/>While the ending does bring together all the unlinked and confusing elements, Vanilla Sky wants to be much more than a simple action-thriller. A love triangle, a deeper and more meaningful introspection on the ""self"" and its various psychological components, a philosophical bent... A lot could be done with this mixture of science fiction and psychological drama, but the movie ultimately fails to accomplish its own goals. If it's going to be about an ego-centric publishing heir who turns a new leaf, give us more of a basis for his motivations. Sophia's character wasn't strong enough for us to believe that she, alone, compelled him, especially since they knew each other only a day when his tragedy befell him. While Cameron Diaz did an excellent job at a femme fatale, her relationship to David was too unimportant to him to make the ""love triangle"" germane to the plot. It was hard to feel empathy for him. (Fear, yes, but that's two-dimensional; not the depth that the film could and should have achieved.)<br/><br/>To its credit, the film does succeed in providing a beautifully filmed series of scenes, with good-looking people and a climax that does pull together the loose ends and give the audience a sense of completion. To a less-discerning, younger-generation of movie-goers, this may be worth the price of admission. However, for me, the movie failed to meet its own potential, eroding my opinion of it to a tepid yawner."

","I always thought that Tom Cruise was a pretty boy. I automatically hated him......then I saw his performance of Jerry Maguire, and he was exceptionally good. I then rented Magnolia, and he was good in that too, so since then I've began taking an interest in his films from MI:2 through to this film - VANILLA SKY.<br/><br/>I made sure I went into this film as cold as a turkey - I didn't want to see any trailers for the film, I hadn't read any reviews, so I didn't really hav a clue what to expect, and I'm soooooooo glad, because I think I appreciated the film far more.<br/><br/>This film, may I say is very, very good. It has a great script - even though it's a remake, don't hold that against it! The storyline is very cleverly wrapped around one single event in David Aames' life. Cruise shines in his role, giving a performance which ranges from - dashingly smug, depressed, in complete love, confusion, frustration, etc etc. Yep, it's all here (almost!). His character goes through so much that you MUST give him credit for it.<br/><br/>Cruz is actually very good in this film - I liked her in 'Blow' with Johnny Depp - she does well here, reprising her role from the original, and giving it a fresh new feel, and to top it all - I can UNDERSTAND what she is saying!!<br/><br/>Cameron Diaz is equally as good, if not better as the suicidal, and crazed Julie. Her role was quite a challenge I suspect, as she could have easily gone down the one dimensional 'unhinged stalker' path and given a crap performance, but she doesn't, she keeps it controlled, and unnerving. A career performance from her in which is a vital role to the film as a whole.<br/><br/>Kurt Russell? I've always liked Kurt, and he doesn't dissapoint here, he is strong in his role and come the end, I don't even think he knew what was happening, and to show that on screen, is truly something to behold.<br/><br/>And finally, Cameron Crowe. He has, with this film, proved himself to be more than a 'feel good' director. He has created a world which will captivate his audience. His opening of a completely deserted Times Square is unforgettable - David Aames is a character that fears being alone, and what sense of loneliness would you feel if everything in Times Square came to a stop? Phew! But, that's just the BEGINNING! When we are drawn in even deeper to Aames' world, we are as disillusioned and as confused as he is! I won't give plot details away here, but just don't try to think too much during this film - it'll all be explained to you come the end, and if you are NOT moved to shed at least one tear, then get yourself checked into the closest asylum!!!<br/><br/>****PLOT SPOILER - I THINK**** After Aames' tragic car crash, which some might say had it coming, we witness the 'Golden boy's' transformation, and by God is it very realistic. The make-up is great, and I never once questioned the fact that it WAS make-up. Cruise's performance and the way his 'new face' sits on him is shocking. Of course, the first initial shock of seeing him look the way he does after the accident does wear off eventually, but it does come back to haunt us as it does to David himself. Very clever.<br/><br/>So, to conclude - this film succeeds in all levels of genre that it undertakes - romance, thriller, comedy, and even sci-fi to a degree. It has a good, strong plot coupled with strong actors and characters. Mix  all this up with a cracking soundtrack, and a director who knows what he wants and never insults his audience, and you have a film that will make you consider your everyday actions, value other people's feelings, and make one hell of a pub conversation or two.<br/><br/>This is the best film I have seen in a long long time!!<br/><br/>""Without the sour, the sweet ain't as sweet.""<br/><br/>A good line, and one I can fully relate to!<br/><br/>9/10<br/><br/>Enjoy!"

","***Possible spoilers<br/><br/>I specifically say POSSIBLE spoilers because, although there are a lot of twists in Vanilla Sky to give away, there are few the movie doesn't give away itself. Particularly the final twist is telegraphed way too early and obviously by showing a completely out-of-place tv-clip about cryogenics (the frequent hinting at David Aames' fear of heights is a pretty good example too). And since so much of the final third of the movie is spent on twisting and turning this is pretty unforgivable. It gets even worse when you have a reasonable ammount of twist movie viewing experiences under your belt. Several twists seem to have been lifted right out of Total Recall, Dark City and/ or The Matrix. Vanilla Sky furthermore shows little understanding of how twists work, throwing in more than a few for their own sake (because we like twists, right??). In Fight Club or The Sixth Sense they add levels of depth, in Lost Highway they mostly seem to support an all-pervading feel of dread and unease, here they are there because we like the aforementioned films. Cameron Crowe is not David Lynch and he should have known it.<br/><br/>As matter of fact, the twists began annoying me so much around 90 minutes into the film, they actually became unintendedly hilarious. What made it even funnier, for me, was the pretentiousness with which Cameron Crowe (a usually fine director, plus one of the two directors who got a decent performance out of Tom Cruise - in Jerry Maguire, the other is PT Anderson for Magnolia) presents it all. It has a fractured flashback structure, adds far too much weight to its ludricrous closing scenes (and many other ones, all scenes in which Aames wears his 'prosthetic' for example) and has the need to explicitate its themes from time to time. He also seems to be under the illusion that this is a surreal film. It, however, didn't convince me. The clunky exposition near the ending is too final for me. Crowe doesn't bring any duality into play. Had I walked out of it thinking maybe even the explanation about what happened to Aames was just a figment of his imagination (thus opening the movie to a host of new explanations again), I, being a twist fan too, would have liked it a lot better. Then there's his popculture fetishism, which, after the umpteenth misplaced song, kinda gets on your nerves (I WOULD have enjoyed some references to the movies this is stealing from, though). Also, there's surprisingly little humour (`Cryo-tainment.' is a gloriously bad example).<br/><br/>In fact, looking at this 'cover version' of the Spanish film Abre les Oyos you get the impression the entire film is nothing but a miscalculated vanity project for Tom Cruise for, while he may spend half the running time either wearing a mask or scar tissue make-up, this film is all about him and his performance. He does get to show off a little more range than usual, but his character is no distinctly unlikable you never care for him. His David Aames start off as an extremely cocky, spoilt little brat oozing fake charm and, after the accident, turns into an equally detestable self-pitying man, who seems to care more about the fact that he's lost his looks than his life. Cruise can do the cocky, spoilt little brat oozing fake charm part, but falls dramatically short during his later scenes. His disfigured Aames seems to be modelled after Jack Nicholson's brilliant over-acting turn from The Shining and his man-in-the-mask scenes with Kurt Russell are so grotesquely played it's embarrassing.<br/><br/>Yes, I know the film is basically a collection of pop-culture elements, but does that justify this film being this simple and empty? Yes, getting Times Square blocked off for shooting is impressive, too bad the scene isn't. So, are there any redeeming features? Well for me there were only a few: Cameron Diaz is very good and both Jason Lee and Russell are fine. And that's about it. Not that it's a technically inept film, but it never rises above the average in those respects. Another (fatal) point: the romance between Cruise and Cruz never generates any chemistry on-screen. Maybe it's the way Aames shamelessly steals Cruz' character from his best friend, or maybe it's because she falls for someone like him, either way there's something unlikable about their relationship. Thus, the movie fails to engage either as a head-scratching or a romantic thriller.<br/><br/>The whole idea of interweaving reality and dreams is (still) a very interesting one, but it's been done both before and better. Vanilla Sky is a movie that is pretentious but looks down upon its audience at the same time.<br/><br/>Rating: 4/10"

I've seen people heralding the genius of this film and I've seen people professing the pretension of this film.<br/><br/>People are unhappy with it, for conflicting reasons. Some people have said that the entire film is too complicated and vague, while others have said that the ending is a sell-out, put on a plate for the viewer and thus compromising its artistic integrity.<br/><br/>I would certainly disagree with the latter opinion. I think that the end of the film is unpredictable, original, and damn entertaining. It sheds light on ALL the seemingly inexplicable inconsistancies, which really boil down to the continuous alteration of the reality Dave perceives. It gives the entire course of events a surreal plausibility(if that makes any sense!).<br/><br/>
And yet, it leaves an element of mystery. The 'open your eyes' line at the end opens up an entirely new can of worms. The 'is he just after opening his eyes to a new dream?' question is provoked. And that is I believe an invitation for the viewer to examine what exactly is so damn irrefutably real about OUR own reality? The cryogenics 'lucid dream' explanation when it comes provides a much more satisfying twist than simply explaining Dave's delusions with psychosis.<br/><br/>It is a little far-fetched perhaps, the idea that this type of technology would be accessible, but a little application of imagination and it shouldn't bother even the most ardent of cynics. They are the very people complaining that the viewer is spoonfed by the final ten minutes synopsis of what occured. So can't they use that brain of theirs they so love to use and decide for themselves how this could have been possible?<br/><br/>I had heard absolutely no feedback or read any reviews before I went to see this film, and as such, didn't expect much based on the current standard of American movies. It blew me away. The best film I've seen in ages. I've also gathered that by the sheer volume of comments on this message board it provoked a lot of thought in others, displayed either willingly or in the mask of cynicism which (along with attempting to assert yourself to others and compensate for your deficits in other areas) was an indication of the thought-provoking majesty of this great film."

","""Vanilla Sky"" is Cameron Crowe's remake of ""Abre los Ojos"", a surrealist Spanish movie, which, like so many surrealist Spanish movies, I didn't see.<br/><br/>The remake takes place in New York, and, as required by federal law, opens with a helicopter shot of Manhattan that passes directly over the buildings until midtown resembles a grid of concrete layer cakes.  David Aames (Tom Cruise) is a cocky young magnate who runs a Maxim-oid magazine which he inherited from his father.  Surrounding him are Julie (Cameron Diaz), a singer with whom he engages in (for him) recreational sex; Brian (Jason Lee), his cool-geek novelist sidekick; and Sofia (Penelope Cruz), a mysterious ballerina that his buddy brings to a party.  Sparks fly between Cruz and Cruise, causing jealousy all around, leading to something I guess you would call a romantic parallellogram, ending in a car wreck that disfigures Cruise's face and cripples his cockiness.  He has to rebuild his life, while struggling against ""The Board"", seven sourpuss executives determined to steal his company.<br/><br/>This is told in flashback: Cruise is in custody for murder, talking absently with a police psychologist (Kurt Russell), monitored by an ill-tempered guard who is itching for an excuse to throttle Cruise silly (maybe he saw ""Cocktail"").  The story shifts between reality and dreams frequently, which is alarming to Cruise.  He doesn't know when he's dreaming or not, what is real, and what happened or what he only thinks happened.  One minute he's sharing a cozy moment with Cruz, the next he's with Diaz (one wonders how, exactly, that constitutes a problem).  Is he going crazy?  Is he dreaming? After a while of this, I was in agreement with the dyspeptic guard: gimme five minutes in a room with the screenwriter and a rubber hose; I'll get this narrative-structure thing straightened out.<br/><br/>We spend too long early on observing Cruise's party lifestyle, watching pretty people flirt blandly with one another.  The scenes are shallow, the dialogue cutesy, until the movie threatens to become yet another dull, talky, New York-set relationship comedy (I kept expecting Edward Burns to wander into a shot).  By the time it takes a serious turn with Cruise's disfigurement, we have little invested in the characters.  Cruise's plight seems less about profound crisis than vanity: his face is messed up, but it's not THAT bad.  He's still Tom Cruise, for Pete's sake.  He no longer has stunning women throwing themselves at him every three frames or so, but then, some of us have to live with that reality every day.<br/><br/>The acting is effective and involving, if familiar.  Cruz played this role in the original; she's on friendly territory.  And she's not alone; ""Vanilla Sky"" sometimes feels like a weekend retreat for characters from other movies: Tom Cruise from ""Jerry Maguire"" meets Cameron Diaz from ""A Life Less Ordinary"" meets Jason Lee from ""Mallrats"" meets Kurt Russell from ""Unlawful Entry"".  While Cruise has played parts like this before, there's a reason: he's good at it.  His David, post-wreck, is not always sympathetic or readable (especially while behind a ""Halloween""-style therapeutic mask), but he's never uninteresting.  What credibility David's problems have stems entirely from Cruise's performance, and it's a lot to shoulder.  The characters do develop, it just takes most of them a long time to get around to it.<br/><br/>I should come clean, too, that I am an inveterate Cameron Diaz junkie (proof: I made it through ""Keys to Tulsa"" AND ""Very Bad Things"".  My AMPAS Medal of Valor is pending.)  So I'll skip some hagiography and say she's good in a relatively small role.  Her confrontation with Cruise is deranged, disjointed, a little degrading, and heartbreaking.  Julie's nuts, but she's also a girl in love, who has been treated rather callously, and we find ourselves wanting to kick Cruise in the head (at least I did; but I get like that).  Diaz is also the first to invest her character with any kind of inner life, any signs of something under the surface.  Cruise doesn't manage that until the second reel, Cruz even later; Jason Lee never gets far beyond amiable goofiness.<br/><br/>The movie is visually powerful, and that goes a long way.  Crowe infuses it with dreamy imagery and well-chosen music that smoothes over some of the clunky, predictable moments in the script.  The ending reveals a nifty premise well brought off (though you'll likely see it coming), and the last scenes have a weird Zen beauty to them, though they list a bit under the weight of some New Age silliness.  Unfortunately, even though we appreciate the well-crafted conclusion, there's still all the UPN-grade dramaturgy we had to slog through first.<br/><br/>""Vanilla Sky"" aims for highbrow surrealism, but the movie it most called to mind was ""Total Recall"", which explored many of the same themes (granted, with more stuff blowing up).  However, its attempt with ""The Board"" to inject paranoia into the story doesn't take.  Good paranoia movies work because they weave a just-plausible layer of conspiracy into real life. Because ""Vanilla Sky"" is so unreal already, there's not much to be paranoid about.  How is ""The Board"" supposed to dictate the reality in Cruise's head? How is anybody?<br/><br/>I don't exactly counsel against seeing ""Vanilla Sky"".  There is enough talent wrapped up in it to make it slightly more than the sum of its flawed parts.  And, hey, anything for Cameron Diaz."

","Vanilla Sky reunites 'Jerry Maguire's director Cameron Crowe and star Tom Cruise.  There is hype before the film's release because its making seemingly brought about the romance between the two main stars Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise plays David, a rich and successful owner of a magazine publishing company who meets and falls for Sofia (Penelope Cruz), his best friend's guest at his party.  He promptly dumps his 'f**k buddy', Julie Gianni (Cameron Diaz) who actually believes herself to be a real girlfriend and starts stalking him.  A move which David must regret is when he gets into Julia's car with her, not realising that she is just a little annoyed at being discarded.  The result is a horrific car accident which leaves him badly disfigured and experiencing events which he can't be sure are real or imaginary.  Kurt Russell plays a psychologist who tries to help David figure out whether what he remembers are dreams or reality and it is mainly through David's interviews with his psychologist that the audience is presented with flashbacks of events.<br/><br/>Such is Cruise's superstar status that one feels he can take risks by accepting non-mainstream roles such as this -he spends a significant part of the film disfigured or wearing a latex mask.  No doubt, many people who go and see this movie will be disappointed by this fact but nevertheless, you still get to see that winsome trademark grin and Cruise manages to evoke sympathy through his character's confusion and torment.  Penelope Cruz is charming as Cruise's love interest and the chemistry between the two stars is evident on the screen.<br/><br/>Events after the car crash are extremely confusing but stick with it and you will be enlightened by an explanation towards the end of the film which has a tinge of science fiction about it.  Although I was utterly confused, I was still intrigued and interested in the characters and what on earth was happening.  'Vanilla Sky' is certainly a thought provoking and memorable film but is also a film which I still can't decide whether I like or not. Thinking about it some more, I'm tending towards liking it.

Very Lynch-like, perfectly depicted, two crucial women, main character unable to distinguish between dream and reality... excited you expect a fabulous ending which never comes. Instead, you are given a strong kick in the face by an all self-explanatory ending which such a movie does not deserve. If you do want to enjoy the movie and keep the feeling of the unknown inside you(since there are things that cannot or should not be explained) leave the cinema 15 minutes before the film ends."

","Frankly speaking, I went to see this movie only for the reason I was curious about what Tom Cruise had made from this fantastic, terrific Spanish movie, but I was really disappointed. The only positive thing what I can say about the remake is that an empty Times Square at 9 o`clock in the morning is for sure far more impressive than Paseo de la Castellana in Madrid, and I liked the opening scene of Manhattan`s view from above. The rest is just a weak attempt to settle the story in the American reality. All the characters are much better in the original film, including Penélope Cruz: even if she has a lovely Spanish accent in English, the fact is in Amenábar`s movie she acted better. I also heard from people that hadn`t had the chance to see ""Open your eyes"" that it was very difficult for them to understand the plot. And finally, although Cruise spent, as I believe, bigger bucks on his film than Amenábar, adding all kinds of special effects, money is not everything: it`s talent what really matters."

","I can find no justification for this remake other than as a trade off for Amenavar to get Cruise to produce The Others. And the story for the Others and Amenavar's track record is so good that I'm sure this wasn't necessary for his jump to ""studio"" flicks. Abre Los Ojos is not some old black and white movie or low production value gerrilla film which could really be rediscovered by the gloss ""contemporary"" hollywood treatment. Abre Los Ojos is fine as it is, more elegant, shocking, and intensely directed than Vanilla Sky and it's not even 5 years old. Come on. I'm sure Crowe might've enjoyed the break from both writing and directing, but his upbeat talents, gracefully evident in  Almost Famous are totally out of place in this work-for-hire remake of what is a dark, current, exhilarating film: Abre los ojos."

Please turn it dow, the old Monkees and Beach Boys makes this seem like a weak acid flick like Jack Nicholson's ""Psyche Out"".<br/><br/>
	Penelope Cruz seemed like a much better actress with subtitles, the reading is so monotone. The Cameron Diaz character was better in the first film because there was less of a ""relationship"" between her and David and she was less attractive. This makes her more dangerous, the more casual realtionship makes David more of a heel. Crowe, of course, would hesitate to make any main character less than likable, especially Tom Cruise, a fine actor who is miscast as he brings too much audience presupposition to this. The dialoge is TOO MUCH, as Crowe seems to want to add more meaning, more statements to a fine film that simply weigh it down. Unlike most foreign films, you cannot find Abre los Ojos boring or pretentious even if you hated it. Sadly, we can't say that this time around.<br/><br/>** 1/2 as my expectations may be too high compared to the first film, but the soundtrack and banter are too much."

","Vanilla Sky had the potential to be a modern classic, but is let down by mediocre performances by its leading stars, Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz. Tom Cruise is not bad in this film, but never engrosses himself in his role to the level of Eyes Wide Shut and Magnolia, where he captured a previously unimpressed sector of ""serious"" film fans. He's gone back to the bright, white-toothed Jerry Maguire mode, a more universally appealing, but shallower, character. However, the Achilles Heel of Vanilla Sky is the totally inept performance of Penelope Cruz. To be fair, this is the result of a hopeless miscast, as Cruz's acting limitations are only part of the problem. In the movie the director, Cameron Crowe, expects us to believe that the shallow, hedonistic David Aames (Cruise) would drop the salacious Julie Gianni (Cameron Diaz) like a ton of bricks for the Spanish cutsie, Sofia (Cruz)."

Occasionally it did threaten to be remotely interesting, but on each occasion it was soon brought to a shuddering halt.<br/><br/>I detest braindead Hollywood action films, exploding cars, unnecessary sex or violence. Likewise, I enjoy a good thinking film open to interpretation. So reading these reviews I should of enjoyed this film. Wrong.<br/><br/>
It was awful. I had no problem following it or understanding the plot ""getting it"" as many have said. It was just painfully dull & went against everything that good cinema is about. Dreams are difficult to effectively insert into films at the best of times but it was done terribly here.<br/><br/>
Interpretations are all well & good, but I'd imagine no 2 people who even worked on this film would share a view exactly what went on. It asked some interesting questions & created some Matrix style ideas. Unfortunately, none of them were fully executed & you end up with more questions than answers.<br/><br/>Maybe it was just the whole subject. This wasn't the film I set out to see nor had any idea it was a remake, but I get the feeling I won't enjoy the original, nor, heaven forbid, any future similar films.<br/><br/>I gave it an hour & a half of solid concentration but then lost the will to live.

"Graunch","Null","0","0","2 February 2002"," enjoyable but irritating
","Possible spoilers throughout.<br/><br/>I watched this movie with first great enjoyment, then simply enjoyment and as it went past the two-hour mark an increasing sense of impatience.  The opening scenes, Tom Cruise's dream of being alone in New York, was extremely effective.  Being alone when you don't want to be is everyone's nightmare, so finding yourself alone in a deserted city, and a futuristic version of your hometown at that, would be twice as scary.  <br/><br/>That out of the way, we were introduced to character A (Cruise), the pleasure seeking, rich, handsome publishing executive who runs a multi-million dollar company while getting as much enjoyment out of life as he can.  Are we supposed to like him less because he inherited the company, rather than having to work for it?  Is there any nobility in being handed riches on a plate?  We also meet character B, hero's best friend, and character C, hero's girlfriend.  Or rather, she thinks she is his girlfriend but he thinks she is just his friend with whom he can sleep from time to time.   At Cruise's birthday party (was that Stephen Spielberg as himself giving Cruise a hug and wishing him happy birthday?) we meet character D, a female friend of character B.  A decides he wants D, takes it slowly for the sake of enjoying the chase but as we all know he will, he gets her in the end.    This is not to character C's liking, so she deliberately crashed her car off a bridge while character A is in the passenger seat, killing herself and injuring A so that he survives with disfiguring injuries and has to wear a mask.<br/><br/>All very straightforward.  The twists come as a series of incidents unfold during which we wonder about Cruise's grip on reality.  Yes, we see into his dreams sometimes, but then we are left wondering when the dreams stop and reality begins.  And all is eventually revealed.  But by that time I was impatient with the movie and getting to the stage of wanting it to end and not caring as much as I did half an hour earlier what happened to the characters.  <br/><br/>An interesting movie, with several twists.  Tom Cruise gives and excellent performance, though don't you ever get the feeling that he has it written into his contract that the camera must spend a predetermined number of minutes worshiping his looks?  Full marks to him, though, for playing half the movie in a mask or showing dreadful scars.  I found Penelope Cruz (character D) singularly unprepossessing and couldn't see what Cruise saw in her (in fact or fiction).  In character A's place I would have chosen C (Cameron Diaz) any day of the week.  She is far more attractive and gave a far better performance.<br/><br/>This is a good enough movie but you may prefer to forego seeing it at a theatre and wait until it is available on DVD or video."

","How could you best describe this film? I say highly surreal at times, down right weird and do you know what? it was captivating, I left the cinema screen and since that time the film has stayed in my head. It has a David Lynch and Cronenberg quality about it, in that you never really know what is supposed to be real and what isn't at certain points in the film. All the performances are great, particularly the three leads, Cruise, Cruz and Diaz and for me like many critics the sexy, gorgeous, Cameron Diaz narrowly steals the show. You really must see this film, I love the fact that it has stayed lodged in my brain as I try to work out certain parts of the film. It is really strange, but it is wonderfully shot and excellently acted. Occasionally this film seems like a music video and at other times an advert for a phone company or something, and most of the film I was left with a look of bemusement but in a good way like with films such as Fight Club or Videodrome, just two that come to mind. Where this differs from some others of this sort of confusion based film is that it gives you an answer as to what is going on at the end which you won't see coming until quite close when they hint at it, but then you still are left doubting whats happening thanks to the rest of the movie. I really like this film despite the fact it annoyed the hell out of me, but it did so with good intention unlike some movies that annoy purely because they are bad. I recommend this definately, it stretches the rules of movie making to its limits and leaves you in a daze, some may dislkie this sort of film but I like many love the effect a film like this gives you. I think the director Cameron Crowe achieved what he set out to do, leave the movie in your thoughts long after you've left the screen. This gets an 8/10 it would get a ten but the twist could be seen as perhaps a mixture of ""thats a good one"" and ""yeah right!"" I probably won't see it again until DVD release, I doubt it will have anywhere near the same effect as it did today."

","* possible spoilers *<br/><br/>Imagine if the kid from `Almost  Famous' grew up to remake `Fight Club', `Vertigo' and `A.I.' All at the same time. <br/><br/>Tom Cruise stars as the zillionaire playboy, who falls in love with overly-cute Penelope Cruz, thus earning the wrath of his casual girlfriend, Cameron Diaz. She drives her car off a bridge with Cruise in it, but is only successful by half. Then things get weird. <br/><br/>The movie has way too many glamour shots of Tom Cruise (Pretty Tom Cruise! Ugly Tom Cruise! Latex encrusted Tom Cruise!) and at least one red herring too many, but the main complaint that I've heard logged against the movies is that it's too confusing- which confuses me since the last 20 minutes of the movie are designed to carefully explain the previous 2 hours. In these final minutes, however, Cameron Crowe does manage to give Cruise's character a soul in just a few clever seconds: when he reveals that his waking dream world has been based on the album cover for The Freewheelin Bob Dylan, Atticus Finch from To Kill a Mockingbird and Truffaut's Jules and Jim, the choices are so pitch-perfect, that Crowe is able to transform the impression of Cruise being just  an empty vessel. <br/><br/>Cruise and Diaz are serviceable in their roles. Cruz's cuteness gets old fast (she seems to be the spiritual sister of Ali McGraw in Love Story) and the really fine performance in the film is delivered by Kurt Russell as the paternal psychologist that Cruise creates for himself. He does Gregory Peck proud.  <br/><br/>Overall, a movie that just isn't as experimental as it's hyped itself to be."

","There's not a lot to say about this film. Really, there isn't. If you don't really understand it, you may call it ""ingeniously provocative"" or ""appealingly philosophical"" or any other term that will make you look intelligent. People look for an explanation and come up with plots so complex that it makes the whole thing look silly. Really silly. The actual clue here, is that there is none.<br/><br/>This is art, ladies and gentlemen. Art in disguise, in the world of massive consumption media. It's a composition of ideas interweaving and merging into each other. Just like Monet's painting shown in the picture, featuring the 'vanilla sky', it is an impression of reality. You have to look at it the way you look back at a dream you've just woken up from. Some parts are still clear in your memory, while others have already begun to fade out of your mind. And the whole - well - makes no real sense at all. Or if you believe that dreams have a meaning, it can make any sense you would want it to have.<br/><br/>
Vanilla Sky is like one of Monet's paintings. When you examine his works at close range, they will look like assemblies of random brush strokes; as if the artist wanted to paint a surreal landscape. However, if you take a few steps back (or like in my case: simply take off your glasses), you will see the colours flow into each other and something will start to take shape inside your own imagination. Something really familiar. Monet wants to depict landscapes; he describes them with colour, so that we can make up their form ourselves.<br/><br/>Hold on to that thought, and use it to look at Vanilla Sky. Everything in it has a purpose and yet, nothing has a meaning on its own. See it as a whole, but don't be disappointed if it would turn out that the whole makes no sense to you either. What Vanilla Sky wants to depict is life; it describes it with images, so that we can reflect them on our own lives.<br/><br/>
It's all about impression.<br/><br/>To conclude this review, I'd like to make one last remark. You can't really rate this film. You can't say that it's good, because it is NOT good. And you can't say it's bad either, because in a way, that's what it tries to be. Sweet and sour. What you can do, is decide whether you like it, or not. And to be honest with you, I didn't like it. It did bore me at times and I really don't like to be bored inside a movie theater (especially not when the movie has already started). On the other hand, I don't regret seeing it. Now that the movie is over, I'm starting to appreciate it. It's an attempt of using Hollywood to bring art to the masses, without Hollywood being fully aware of it.<br/><br/>Open Your Eyes"

"Aidan McGuinness","7","0","0","30 January 2002"," Different is not necessarily brilliant
","""Vanilla Sky"" is a hard movie to judge because it's not quite in the normal Hollywood mode, which is generally a good thing though it doesn't mean you end up with a good movie.<br/><br/>It's hard to talk too much about the plot of the movie without actually spoiling the movie. It's sufficient to say that Cruise's character David is disfigured in a car accident somehow and has been arrested for murder. The details prior to his arrest are revealed in that, somewhat tired old narrative tool of flash-back. What makes the film more interesting is that it switches between a couple of time-lines and the time-lines themselves can shift in keeping with David's memory of events. However in the final third of the movie the plot takes a gigantic shift and asks the viewer to swallow some rather large doses of disbelief. The final ending whiffed a bit too much of ""AI"" for me in terms of tone and sentiment and was somewhat unsatisfactory. The plot may shift a bit but, despite what other reviewers would have you believe, isn't all that complicated. Certainly at the end it's hammered home as to what happened to David that only an idiot *could* be confused... and it also speaks too much of a ""big reset"" button. You'll know what I mean once you've seen it all.<br/><br/>Cruise is good in this. Generally I'm indifferent to his acting, feeling he gets by on his pretty-boy looks but he finds justification for himself playing the tortured soul here. Penelope Cruz is adequate although doesn't exhibit a whole load of emotional range (presumably stymied by not acting in her native tongue) and Diaz has a tendence to put in a somewhat hammy-psycho-girl performance which I can not always take seriously. David's mate, played by Jason Lee, and David's lawyer, played by Kurt Russell, are both perfectly passable without being scene-stealing or giving the Academy anything to notice.<br/><br/>As to Crowe's adaptation of the original movie, I found it for the most part well enough done. Firstly I enjoyed the sound-track, partially because it featured about 5 of my favourite bands but also because the musically was generally particularly well chosen (as someone pointed out the REM track ""Sweetness Follows"" is excellently placed). The cuts between scenes are generally well handled without being confusing or unnecessary and the production values, in the character's houses, reflect the personas well. Crowe can be a bit heavy-handed at times and this is of particular note in his overly-long explanation of ""what happened"" at the end of the movie. Perhaps this is for the benefit of the slower audience members but it made the ending drag out too much (again like ""AI"") - certainly I knew there would be a ""surprise"" ending and correctly guessed the main device that would be used (since Crowe made it quite obvious earlier on in the movie that it would be used - again too heavy). It's well done and capable - scenes like the much-touted Times Square are nice and add to the movie but it's nothing comparable to the sharper touches of David Fincher's ""Fight Club"" to which the movie has (somewhat erroneously) been compared.<br/><br/>I'd recommend you see ""Vanilla Sky"" to form your own opinion. It's a breath of fresh air at least and is that bit ""different"" from your average formulaic 5 act movie. Whether you'll come across feeling somewhat mutely disappointed, as I did, is hard to tell. In the end I'll give it a 7/10 and look with interest to see if Crowe can do better next time seeing as how I enjoyed his last piece ""Almost Famous"" that bit more than this."

","HEY!!!! *POSSIBLE SPOILERS*<br/><br/>I'm all about dreams and questioning reality and knowing that there is nothing to know. and I'm all about art that deals with those and other subjects. Unfortunately, in the city I live in, there isn't much of a chance for exposure to art of that nature. So, if I want to see art like that in the theater, I have to settle for Vanilla Sky. Any film that includes the lines ""This is a revolution of the mind"" and ""Oh I'm sorry, I'm blowing your mind"" isn't really doing anything to your mind.<br/><br/>It's easy to throw out the ideas that are thrown in this movie if you pad them with 15 minutes of explanation and ""lubby-dubby"" dialogue.<br/><br/>I have a hard time understanding how anyone could not understand this movie seeing that they spend forever explaining the concept that wasn't that incomprehensible in the first place.<br/><br/>On Jay Leno, Cameron Crowe said that this is a ""love story"" and that is what is wrong with this movie. In someone else's hands, this film could have been great, but it also could have been much worse. Cameron should stick to movies like ""jerry maguire"" and ""almost famous"" and ""say anything"" he is good at those.<br/><br/>If you mixed up the most outrageous art house film you ever saw<br/><br/>and the sappiest, stupidest love story you ever saw, you would get Vanilla Sky. We only need so many lines that ""sum up the human condition in one phrase"" before they sound tired.<br/><br/>
I definitely liked this movie enough to recommend it, though.         It proposes ideas and questions that wouldn't be proposed to the general audience if it didn't have so many stars in it. and the final minute is well done for impact. generally every song fit (except for ""good vibrations"")There were a few really good scenes now that I think of it.<br/><br/>But, of course, how could you pass up any movie that includes the funniest thing you can ever include in a movie ...........................................................

"JAM-31","Null","0","0","29 January 2002"," Cameron Crowe Fails (Spoilers, of course)
","I know that ""Vanilla Sky"" is supposed to be a remake of ""Abre Los Ojos,"" which I haven't seen.  But I think Cameron Crowe was more influenced by other films and trends when he made this film.<br/><br/>It is usually a good thing for directors to step outside their boundaries, and experiment with new techniques, material, and subject matter.  But it doesn't always work.  I am not the biggest fan of Cameron Crowe.  I wasn't impressed by ""Jerry Maguire,"" which was overly long and clichéd, nor by ""Almost Famous,"" which I found slow and uninvolving (although I know I am clearly alone here.)  But I know there was something about these two films that audiences and critics loved, which probably had to do with the amount of heart that Crowe put into them.  I could definitely see Crowe's passion in this movie, but it didn't mean the movie was a success.<br/><br/>""Vanilla Sky"" plays like bunch of sampled techniques from films that are superior in their experimentation.  It seems that Crowe wanted to make his ""Requiem for a Dream,"" ""Fight Club,"" or ""The Devil's Advocate.""  The crafts that he borrows are tired now, and the film never appears like anything more than a failure and exploitation of these methods.  The quick cuts, splices, and camera tricks have no punch and fail to grab us.  The numerous twists and eventual copouts offered by the plot never have any impact.  The film starts out coherently, but I found the first half hour to be just awful--for some reason, in this and the other Crowe films I have mentioned, I was totally uninvolved in the story.  I found Tom Cruise's character to be really dull and he left me detached from his interactions with Penelope Cruz.  I never felt like I knew who these two characters were or why I should care (or not care) about them.  The ""car crash"" sequence interrupts the weary story but isn't anything special, and I found Cameron Diaz' performance to be too much on the campy side.  Many have commended the opening dream sequence, which shows us an empty Times Square in New York City.  But I found that it irritatingly resembled an internet or cell phone commercial.  There really isn't any imagination to the brief sequence--we have already seen empty streets of once busy places to fill us in that ""this is a dream""--the fact that it's Times Square just reminds us that there are thousands of frustrated New Yorkers waiting off camera to go about their business.  The scenes involving Cruise's irritation with his broken face are gruesome, but not disturbing enough to equal good moviemaking.  These moments are sometimes humorous, and the final sequence is photographed very well, but the answers of the movie are unsatisfying, and make questions and plot points presented earlier in the film irrelevant.<br/><br/>Cameron Crowe was passionate about this film, but this just isn't his field.

"plumberguy66","Null","0","0","22 January 2002"," My humble opinion...
","First: I would like to thank the filmmakers for making Vanilla Sky. Until I heard about Vanilla Sky I had never heard of the film Abre los Ojosm or Alejandro Amenabar.<br/><br/>Second: To correct some of these reviewers, Alejandro IS given writing credit for this film and who cares if Penelope Cruz reprised the role for the American version. If she was the right person for the first one, then why not cast her for this version?<br/><br/>Now that being said. I had gone to the theatre in order to see Gosford Park but it was sold out and the only thing showing at the same time was Vanilla Sky. Since it has been out for some weeks, I figured the theatre would not be packed so I went for it. I had heard very mixed reviews about this movie and didn't know anyone (who's opinion I can trust) who had seen it. I am not a big Tom Cruise fan and had a bit of reluctance. I liked Cameron Crowe's past work but some of the reviewers claimed that this was not a style of movie that he should be handling. Well I have to say I'm happy Gosford Park was sold out. I think Mr. Crowe did a great job and even Mr. Cruise didn't get on my nerves. In fact the only other movie I actually liked Tom Cruise in was Jerry Maguire . go figure. I guess they just work well together.<br/><br/>In all honesty I knew going in that this film dealt with dreams and not knowing what's real or not, so on and so forth. So, I opened my mind and just took it all in. From the first minute I was hooked. I was completely sucked into this intriguing story and then sideswiped by the surprise ending. Ah, the ending (no spoilers) it left me with butterflies in my stomach. What a frightening prospect.  I obviously didn't see it coming, but on hindsight (and for some of you VS bashers out there), there is a mild hint/reference to the ending at the beginning of the film. The visuals in this film are wonderful. I loved the Times Square scene. The performances are great. I especially enjoyed Cameron Diaz as the one-hell-of-a frightening, ""I'm about to loose it, you can see it in my eyes"" spooky-girl portrayal. I hadn't seen Penelope Cruz in much else but I thought she was great. Jason Lee was Jason Lee. I didn't even know the Kurt Russell was in the movie until I saw him on the screen. A delightful surprise and a nice performance.<br/><br/>Ok, so why all this bashing of Vanilla Sky by the fans of Abre los Ojosm anyway? If one is to believe some of the reviewers, this is a COPY of Abre los Ojosm. So, does that mean in order to have an interesting tale told to us we must speak a foreign language or read subtitles and miss the visuals? I hope not. There would be a lot of disappointed people out their if that where true. I applaud people that have the courage to translate movies, as well as books into versions that suite the audiences watching or reading them. I can think of one work in particular that scores of people's lives would be very different if the original had not been redone in a different language. One version is the King James.<br/><br/>I urge everyone to form his or her own opinion of course. But I think about the fact that I almost missed this one by listening to the jaded opinions of what seem to be rather narrow-minded people.<br/><br/>Oh! One last thought. I've read some reviews that compare Vanilla Sky to The Game and that's too bad. The Game, while it kept you wondering what was really going on, was in the end an insulting let down. I.e. Michael Douglas' character was being shot at with blanks. blanks that tore everything to pieces and left holes in everything. huh? And just how did they know he was going to jump from that side of the building????  Vanilla Sky wraps everything up pretty neatly. Some say conveniently. I think the end was well-done and very thought provoking. That's just my humble opinion."
"Absent Sam","Null","0","0","22 January 2002"," doesn't live up to expectations
","`Forget everything you know about LoveHateDreamsLifeWorkPlayFriendshipSex' An ambitious tagline for any film coming out of Hollywood, even if it is from the much-touted writer-director Cameron Crowe (Jerry Maguire, Almost Famous). Vanilla Sky is no ordinary mainstream film, it attempts to present the audience with the age-old philosophical question: what is reality? Don't be put by such profound inquiries; the film does not really go very far in answering it. The best bits are in fact the electric chemistry between Cruise and Cruz (both of who succeed in looking fantastic).<br/><br/>
The essential plot - without ruining the film for you - is about a spoilt, rich, young millionaire, David Aames (Cruise), who is happily sleeping his way through all the young, beautiful starlets of New York including the slightly psychotic Julie Goanna (Diaz). Aames is a man who has and can get everything, including his best friend's potential girlfriend, the mystical but captivating, Sofia, (Cruz). Unfortunately, this doesn't go to plan and Julie's psychotic tendencies get the better of her. She decides to drive off a bridge with Aames, an unwilling passenger in the car. From then on Aames' life spirals off into a confusing and at time mildly diverting exploration of life, love and reality.<br/><br/>This is an entirely watchable and enjoyable film but it certainly does not live up to its tagline. All the answers to the questions are offered to the audience on a plate at the end of the film unlike the original 1997 Spanish film, Abre los Ojos, by Alejandro Amenabar. Some of the acting is a touch deliberate at the start and Crowe has a tendency to labour his points to the extreme. Add to this a script that churns out platitudes and cheesy profundities in an effort to be charmingly mystical or surreal. Vanilla Sky has neither the style nor the ingenuity of Fincher's Fight Club (a film Vanilla Sky has be compared with). Nevertheless, I cannot be so harsh about a film that is fundamentally inoffensive. The acting from the four leads is impressive.The central love triangle is convincing and comforting, which is great for gossip-lovers only watching to see the Cruise/Cruz action. Diaz, who has been neglected in terms of column inches by these recent events, it exceptionally good as the fatally insane actress; like Anthony Hopkins in Silence of the Lamb, her eyes are terrifyingly penetrating and her smile dangerously seductive. Cameron Crowe's direction is diverting but never insightful and moments that ought to be filled with pure, unadulterated terror (such as the car crash and certain `mirror' shocks) are actually more annoying than frightening. In fact, Aames' conspiracy theory is more terrifying and interesting than the mediocre sci-fi conclusion Crowe offers us.<br/><br/>Perhaps, this is a problem with expectations or a problem with the way it was marketed. Whatever the answer, unfortunately most people will hate it: finding it dull, uninspiring and only mildly thrilling. However, there will be a sizeable number of people who might enjoy the unconventional aspects of the film. Personally, I didn't find the intellectual elements especially intellectual, which is a shame; but it doesn't make Vanilla Sky, a boring film to avoid as there are some redeeming factors. Don't go if you are looking life-changing insights, but do go if you want to see `mortality as home entertainment'.<br/><br/>three stars out of five"

A thoroughly enjoyable experience, with challenges of conventional thinking worthy of a philosophy class. But, if one comes to see Vanilla Sky hoping for another stereotypical flick with Tom Cruise, of which to imitate and use for reassurance of self-esteem, you will surely be disappointed.

","SEMI-SPOILERS<br/><br/>This movie is rather like an ingenious and convoluted (or, at least, convoluted) episode of ""The Twilight Zone.""  Nothing terribly original, but it is extremely well-executed.  Very conveniently, just about everything one might complain of can be taken as part of the grand scheme.  Is Cameron Crowe, with his over-fondness for old rock music, putting too much of it on the soundtrack, and making his hero's life seem like a sentimental fantasy? Ah, but his hero's life IS a sentimental fantasy.<br/><br/>After a number of movies like ""Mulholland Dr."" that basically just screw with our heads and then leave us on our own to figure it out, ""Vanilla Sky"" has a very coherent explanation at the end.  Unfortunately, this means that although you may not leave the theater in a semi-annoyed state, you may well leave with a feeling of ""So what?""<br/><br/>""Vanilla Sky"" really only starts getting interesting if we assume that the mind-f**k is open-ended, and that the explanation we are given at the end is actually yet another layer of what is really going on.  (Of course, all such movies leave themselves open to the interpretation that the entire plot is an illusion.)  There are a number of clues that this is the case, most of which can be brought under the umbrella of the statement ""This is all too good to be true.""  When you start thinking along these lines, it then becomes rather interesting to go back and reevaluate the characters that are presented at the end as the silent friend, the frightened father figure, the loyal employee, and the benevolent dwarves.  And the words ""Open your eyes."" Too good, indeed. . ."

"Moika","7","0","0","16 December 2001"," Interesting, but Crowe doesn't live up to his potential.
","I don't want to give anything away, because this film certainly is thought provoking.  There were parts I really enjoyed and parts, I felt, left something to be desired.  <br/><br/>Cameron Crowe proved that he was a worthy film maker with ""Jerry Maguire"" and that he was an exceptional film maker with the astonishingly good ""Almost Famous"".  That said, ""Vanilla Sky"" just didn't measure up.  At times I felt the acting was sub-par (with the exception of Cameron Diaz, who is always good), and that the film didn't know what it wanted to be.  Is it a romance, a mystery, or a science fiction film?  <br/><br/>I think part of the problem stems from the fact that this was not really Cameron Crowe's movie, unlike ""Say Anything"", ""Jerry Maguire"" and ""Almost Famous"".  Instead it was a remake of a 1997 film, which I haven't seen but understand to be quite good (why would a film maker want to remake a film which is only four years old?).  His earlier projects were films about people.  That is what is so wonderful about them.  With the release of ""Almost Famous"" it seemed that no one was better a putting real life on the screen than Cameron Crowe.  ""Vanilla Sky"" however, is not about people, and this is most likely where it falls short.  There was no Cameron Crowe within the film, unlike ""Almost Famous"", which is all Cameron Crowe.  All of the world's best art comes from within the artist, this film came from within the guy who directed ""The Others"".<br/><br/>With all of that in mind (and I realize it is a lot), ""Vanilla Sky"" is not a bad movie.  As a Crowe fan, my expectations were naturally quite high, and the film didn't live up to them.  However, I certainly suggest that you go see it, and draw your own conclusions.  I gave it a 7 out of 10.  The film is visually beautiful (not to mention the cast) and it will serve as a good conversational piece, if nothing else."

","Vanilla Sky does have its cliches and does have plenty of commercial devices that are at times grating. However, the film demands that the viewer pay attention to it AND that the viewer wait for explanations and, for a Hollywood movie, this is a good thing. The aggressive filmgoer, should find himself or herself rewarded by a viscerally entertaining psychological thriller by the end of the film's over 2 hour running time.<br/><br/>The movie, based on a Spanish novel, is basically an ""is this fantasy or is this reality"" type of film, yet, with a lot of psychology and creativity thrown in.<br/><br/>Its non-linear style, which only serves to advance the chaotic, yet cohesive storyline, and the film's strikingly visual appeal, make up for its contrivances and minor weaknesses. <br/><br/>Like Cameron Crowe's other films, the viewer really has something to sink his or her teeth into with Vanilla Sky. Perhaps not as ""down to earth"" as his recent Almost Famous, but just as involving and much more daring. Whatever he does, Crowe has emerged as one of our more prolific and important directors and Vanilla Sky is no exception."

Penelope Cruz hurts the film as she is only a pretty little thing striving to swim with the big fish but is not quite able to keep up.  Jason Lee turns in a good performance as Cruise's best friend and from 'Jerry Maguire' to 'Almost Famous' to 'Vanilla Sky', this is Crowe's weakest film but still one worth viewing only once although it is very difficult to follow and if you like the film enough, you may need many viewings to figure out everything because the film shifts around so much.

","I was intrigued -- how was Cameron Crowe going to top ""Almost Famous""? How did all those weird scenes in the trailer tie together?  Was this the film that would convince me that Tom Cruise has more talent than I give him credit for? Well, for me ""Vanilla Sky"" was a real mixed bag. Seldom have I had so many loved-it-or-hated-it moments in one film.  On the ""loved"" side was the existential, reality-spinning plot, the usual great Crowe soundtrack of on-target pop/rock songs, and some great performances, particularly by Jason Lee, Cameron Diaz and Kurt Russell (of all people). But that plot gets wrapped up with a tedious pulp-sci-fi explanation at the end that almost sours the preceding two hours. Still, there are so many good moments. In particular I loved the very brief (and barely noticeable) clips from two ""Twilight Zone"" episodes playing on a Times Square video display at the beginning of the movie. One is from ""Shadow Play"", where Dennis Weaver relives the same nightmare again and again. The other is ""It's a Good Life,"" where Billy Mumy creates a bizarre reality for the citizens of his small town. Both, of course, presage major themes to come in ""Vanilla Sky""."
"AEBarschall","Null","0","0","12 January 2002"," Liked him, but not the film
","I am a very big Tom Cruise fan.  It's ironic, because I haven't liked his last three movies, including `Vanilla Sky', but I go anyway, because I like to watch him.  I find him fascinating.<br/><br/>And this film is perfect for the voyeuse (female peeping Tom).  He's in every scene - and you get to see him undressed from the hips up rather frequently.  It was quite a contrast with `Jerry Maguire', where he looked skinny and his shoulders looked droopy.  Here you can see his six pack ripple when he sits up in bed, and his arms and shoulders bulge while he does a dastardly deed.<br/><br/>There is also a GREAT love scene with Penelope Cruz.  Of course, the love went weird, like the whole picture, but for a few minutes it was beautiful.<br/><br/>He has such an overwhelming screen persona.  Seeing this movie was like going for a drink of water and finding myself drowning.  Also, since he was never off screen, I could never go out to the toilet without missing him. It was a long film, so I ended up having to go twice.  Drag!  I suppose this means that I am going to have to see the movie again to get the parts I missed while I was out.<br/><br/>Some critics will tell you that this was a bad movie, because Tom acted badly.  Don't believe it.  His performance was flawless.  He had to express such a range of emotions:  exploitive lust, real love, moved to tears, madness, fear of heights (which we know after MI2 is something that he definitely does NOT suffer from) and so many different types of physical situations: confidently strutting his six pack, the deformed cripple, the deformed cripple getting drunk, the dastardly deed, getting psychotherapy, and much more.  Tom did all of these things perfectly, seamlessly.  You feel real horror with him when he looks at his scarred face.  He was so convincing as the exploitive playboy that some of the critics thought that that was his own real personality, which is not confirmed by other sources at all.<br/><br/>Tom's great acting does not mean that this was a good or enjoyable movie. It was hopelessly weird - what we used to call an `art film.'  Despite being re-made in New York, it is still definitely a European film.  It would be interesting what critics abroad said about this movie.<br/><br/>The interesting thing about Tom having picked this weird film to do is that it was absolutely his decision and no one else's.  It lets us try to psychoanalyze this otherwise intensely private person.  Is he afraid of losing his looks?  Is he afraid of losing his mind?  Is he afraid of becoming violent?  Has all his jet-setting and living with non-American women turned him into a non-American artist?  Or does he have insights into the international market that the rest of us are missing?  All very interesting for the hard core Tom Cruise fan.<br/><br/>What really burns me up was one critic saying Tom should resist doing scenes where he shouts and throws things, because he over-acts.  There is absolutely nothing I like more than seeing Tom shout.  He is so cute when he's angry.  I almost suspect that people keep accusing him of being gay because they want to get one more chance to see him angry.  I also like when Tom gets tears in his eyes.  He does these things really well in this movie. I hope he never stops doing this stuff.<br/><br/>I just wish that Tom could do a movie that I could bring the kids to. They know that I'm a big Tom Cruise fan, but I can't take them because his movies are all PG-13 or R, and pretty upsetting to boot, and my kids aren't old enough for that -- and if there was ever a movie NOT to take your kids to, this is it.  I'm sick of having to sneak off to his movies while the kids are in school.   I gather he did one children's movie, `The Legend,' which was a flop.  Now this is a man who has no hesitation to hang by his hands 2,000 feet above the ground, ride his motorcycle without a helmet, do stunts in his private plane, and race in a race car.  However, one flop has apparently totally scared him off from ever trying a children's movie again. More interesting material for pop psychologists.  You would think that now he's a father himself, he would have a different perspective on this sort of thing<br/><br/>So these are my suggestion for Tom's next movie: a) the movie should be for kids; b) if the movie is more than 90 minutes there should be some non-Tom scenes in the middle where I can take a bathroom break; c) Tom should shout and/or throw things at least once during the movie and he should get tears in his eyes at least once, too;  d) if he feels a temptation toward weirdness, he should just go out and buy some weird socks or something (we almost never get to see his feet in movies.)"

","Crowe's follow up to Almost Famous is more ambitious, which probably explains why it is not as tightly woven.  The existential plot, however, provides the viewer with much to think about.  There is so much to ponder in this film, I suggest seeing it a second time. Crowe is a master at screen romance, and it definitely shows in the palpable chemistry between Cruise and Cruz (Crowe said he was delighted that he caught these two falling in love on screen).  The brilliance of the romance leads the plot turn (not to be spoiled by this reviewer) to have an even greater resonance.  A fantastic film."

","We open with an aerial view of NYC with intermittent pauses of darkness and silence. David Aames (Cruise) wakes up and drives off to see a deserted NYC at 9AM. It's eerily quiet. But it's also just a dream and he wakes up again, and this time all is normal. But at that point, I realized that this movie is going to be a mindfu--. Boy, does it deliver.<br/><br/>The movie can almost be cut into three pieces: the somewhat hokey beginning, the mindfu--ing middle portion, and the resolution that will make many go back to see it again. The hokey beginning shows Cruise living the life of a rich punk getting everything he wants, including Sofia Serrano (Cruz). They have an incredible non-sexual night together; one of those nights where two people connect. He falls for Serrano, which frustrates Gianni to no end, causing her to drive him off a bridge, disfiguring his face.<br/><br/>The second part is filled with disjointed scenes where Cruise is in a jail cell talking with Dr. McCabe (Russell) about a murder while reliving the past. Things become less and less clear and soon the audience is completely confused as to what the hell is going on. <br/><br/>But don't worry as when the secret is revealed, it explains much (though perhaps not all), and even does a nice job stringing in past scenes. I don't want to give anything away; you'll know what I mean when you see it.<br/><br/>The movie isn't perfect, IMO. I wasn't crazy about Cruz, as some of the lines delivered seemed flat, and one scene where she runs away is almost comedic. Also, Crowe sometimes drowns the movie in music to the point of distraction. The first part does sort of lag, but only because it is supposed to establish the story so I don't fault that.<br/><br/>Bottom line, this movie may require some patience in the beginning, but it totally captures you about 1/2-way into the movie and doesn't let you go. When it finally ""opened my eyes"", I was sincerely shocked. I talked about the movie for close to an hour with friends. When a movie makes you think about it after it's over, that's the mark of a good movie. On par with Memento, but still not to the level of Mulholland Drive, Vanilla Sky will probably end up as one of my favorite movies of the year, and one of those movies that come up in conversations of movies that ""you gotta see"". 8/10.<br/><br/>-Mark"

This is a STAR VEHICLE, get it?)<br/><br/>Now:is there anyone who likes Tom Cruise unreservedly? Or is that guy working all the angles behind that golden smile visible to everyone?<br/><br/>Until ""Vanilla Sky"" I liked Tom Cruise - but with provisos.  Now I must admit: he CAN act (though his range is small) and (to his credit)he was willing to take a chance of losing his audience by hiding that fabulous Star-Face for so much of this unhappy story.<br/><br/>The audience filed out as if unconscious before the credits started to roll, and I admit I suffered the same malaise. It was nothing so clear as ""I don't like it.""<br/><br/>The uneasy feeling stayed with me.  In fact, it took me several hours to realize that I simply don't LIKE seeing Tom Cruise as a loser. Life is complicated enough.  I was to see a jaunty happy hero, the place wherein all his attraction lies. (And I'm not a kid; the heroes of my twenties have been dying off for about five years from natural causes.)<br/><br/>When I go to see Tom Cruise I want him to be the Tom Cruise climbing the sheer rock face at the beginning of ""Mission Impossible 2"".<br/><br/>

It is the ultimate in subjective self-awareness (even if it is ironic and a tad silly).  After viewing this film I feel like I just watched one of those skits and am ambivalent about my impressions.

VANILLA SKY starts off as a real nail biter, that is until Tom Cruise stops acting like Tom Cruise and becomes Paranoid-Tom-Crazy-Cruise. No matter how hard he tries, Cruise just isn't taken seriously outside of a witty romance. And once again, will someone please drag Penelope Cruz into the street and riddle her with bullets? Yes, she has a pretty smile and I'm sure Tom and she make a snazzy couple, but the poor girl can't act. However, Jason Lee does it again, delivering a great supporting role without so much as breaking a sweat. Cameron Diaz is deliciously evil, though her part grows old toward the end of the film. <br/><br/>VANILLA SKY desperately needed another hour on the cutting board, deleting some of the nonsense that just adds to the complete confusion of the audience. Now, I'm not saying I don't like confusion. I loved FIGHT CLUB, THE SIXTH SENSE, THE MATRIX, and any other movie that might be labeled as a psychological thriller. But Cameron Crowe's cast seems lost in the film, not sure if this is a surreal romance or a sci-fi horror flick or what. Without ruining the ridiculous ""plot twist"" (an embarrassing deus ex machina), it is difficult to elaborate on the shamefully low point of VANILLA SKY.

Such movies stand the chance to fail because the director takes license with the imagery.  Vincent Ward's ""What Dreams May Come"", I believe, left plot behind when he got caught up in the possibilities of an after-world.  Vanilla Sky does not stray down this path.

The story encompasses all of these things.  The sci-fi stuff at the end while not that original was nicely brought back in (PAY ATTENTION to Benny the Dog!  What I thought at first was just scene filler or fluff came back into the story in a big way!).  I guess watching this post 9-11-01 had something to do with my reaction to the ending.

Also, the expository scene where half the movie explained away is a bit annoying, but maybe Crowe felt it necessary for Ma and Pa Briggs in the Hinterlands so they could understand the movie.  Still, I'm willing to forgive Crowe these mistakes because the sum is so much greater than the individual parts.  <br/><br/>One of the most uniquely satisfying films of 2001 along with David Lynch's MULHOLLAND DRIVE and Kubrick/Spielberg's A.I.<br/><br/>Go see it."

","Well, some of the reviews I've read here are about as misguided as most of the reviews I've heard on the street from people who saw the movie. While some of you put forth very well thought out reasons why you didn't enjoy the movie (which I can respect), most of what I've heard from others and from people here amount to ""duh, I don't get it"". After seeing the movie, the first person I talked to said she hated it and asked me ""So I don't get it. Did Cruz or Diaz die?"". ""I could only shake my head, ask if they even saw the movie, and said 'both'"". I mean damn, it was 150 years later, of course the both died. Even the seemingly elementary concept of where the real world ended and the dream began seems to have been lost for most viewers, and how can someone be expected to appreciate a movie if they can't follow a concept that was, as others have said, spoonfed to them in the final scene. By the way, for those complaining about the fact that the final scene insults their intelligence, talk to your average moviegoer on the street and you'll find out why Crowe had to put a bib on his audience and shove the explanation down our throats. Most people just don't get it. <br/><br/>   Now this isn't to say that you're in an idiot if you didn't understand the movie. We all have different tastes and appreciate different forms of entertainment, and some things just aren't interesting enough to some for them to follow. But it does explain why, as Kevin Spacey says so eloquently in Seven, if you want people to stand up and take notice, you can't tap them on the shoulder anymore. You have to hit them with a sledgehammer. Perhaps some things could have been left up to our imagination, but hey, people are already upset that they had to think during this movie, just imagine if they were asked to use some deductive reasoning to piece together all the different storylines too. <br/><br/>   Anyway, I don't feel like turning this into a 10 page dissertation on why I loved this movie, and why everyone that hated it is wrong. Differing opinions is what is helping to generate the kind of buzz this movie deserves. But everything, from the directing to the acting to the odd choice of music that doesn't fit the scene to the spectacular images of New York, is exactly what i look for in a movie.

","It's not particularly surprising to find such a multitude of disparaging remarks about such a wonderful mind-blowing experience. The original 1997 movie by Alejandro Amenábar, ""Abre los Ojos"", for all intents and purposes was an artistic and intellectually-stimulating piece of cinema merely intended for an artistically-minded audience at arthouse theatres. Cameron Crowe, should therefore have figured out by now, that no matter how hard one tries, the majority of the mainstream audience will never even make an attempt to understand and appreciate anything which is considered offbeat.<br/><br/>Whoever goes to their local multiplex would definitely expect to see the usual Harry Potters and America Pies, so it's basically pointless to ever try introducing such movie-goers to a movie whose roots lie in European arthouse(although one can't really say Abre los Ojos is a typical European movie). Moreover, the Amenábar's original is an excellent movie in its own right, and the biggest flaw of it all was to actually dream of doing its remake in the first place. So why not keep things simple, and leave what is not intended for mainstream away from the mainstream?"

The dialogue hints, at the very beginning, might prompt the viewers to consider the `differences between dreams and reality,' yet, everything about this flick lacks emotion, energy, and sensibility.  Cameron Diaz's appearance is far too brief to be accredited with good performance.  She is wasting her talent with her Julie role!  Cruise's David lacks the flamboyance of his old style of acting; ducking in and out of his disenchanting dis-figured dullard images.  Diaz's Sophia looks so completely superficial to even sustain the viewers' curiosity.  Half the time, she recites her speech in monotone, subjecting her dialogue to appear clearly irrelevant!  And Jason Lee's Brian lacks personality and depth.  The only credible character is Russell's McCabe, but the camera fails to support his acting skills by shifting its focus onto David so consistently.  Other cast members swing unimpressively in and out of scenes only to raise questions on the purpose of their presence.  Absolutely flat performances overall! Even the bedroom scenes are shallow and without any artistic flare.  This movie does little to heave up emotions, angst, intrigue, or suspense, subjecting the viewers' to lose total interest after about twenty minutes into it.  The viewers will be smitten with restlessness and would, in all likelihood, focus their attention on the colorful objects and physical setups in the background than on the characters.  Undoubtedly, Cameron Crowe has a flare for selecting the familiar song scores and these are more melodramatic than the plot's events and characters.  Unfortunately, his favorable scores won't save this movie. The plot holds some very interesting aspects, but they are completely overshadowed by the actors' weak performances, and by the way the film is directed.

","********SPOILERS! ******** SPOILERS!**********<br/><br/>Why did this movie have to be so dishonest? First there was the trailer shown during the ""Coming Attractions"" prelude to another flick which sparked my interest. It looked like this might be a good love story that becomes a thriller. That trailer was for a totally different movie, which isn't a totally bad thing because I am a movie maniac from way back and love all kinds of movies. When Vanilla Sky begins I think I see some very interesting, if not daring themes arise, the main one being that of superficial beauty and the trifling, superficial lives that stem from them. I thought ""whoa!"" Are Cameron Crowe and Tom Cruise really taking us down this road? A better movie than I expected! Then the whole thing chickens out and the numbing, insulting foolishness begins.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise as David Aames is a privileged, self-centered, shallow consumer of all fine things his inherited publishing empire and good looks can buy. He even finds that, during his birthday celebration when his best friend introduces him to a pretty young woman he's just met, his good looks can buy her as well. Among all the flashy cool gadgets (a hologram of John Coltrane playing for fun) and too-fine appointments of his neat pad, Sofia (Penelope Cruz) seems like just the perfect beautiful addition; too bad for his best friend. He knows his friend is smitten with this creature, but David immediately proceeds to pursue her as well as use and flaunt her as a distancing foil against the lingering Julie, Cameron Diaz who plays his former sex-buddy. She's just another toy that's out-lived its novelty, but unfortunately has a mind -- loopy, yes -- of its own.<br/><br/>The beginning of the movie does paint a very good, remorseless look at someone whose life is nothing but fun and superficialities. This lead-in was the only thing that made Cruise's constant mugging, vain preening and too-grating narcissism bearable. This guy was totally in love with himself and his lifestyle. When the jilted Julie goes over the edge and exacts her revenge/suicide (something I thought had too little build-up), David Aames' life becomes a nightmare and at this point I was curious to see how his life would inevitably change.<br/><br/>What we see is that he loses his new love-interest who's just too repulsed by his disfigurement. We see a man who's lost the only currency he had and with his brooding ugliness -- and I don't mean his face -- has frightened his love away. That in itself is a statement either about the tenuous/shallow nature of their attachment to one another after their one chaste night together, a revelation into the superficial nature of her character or a legitimate reaction from someone who's got his number. Either is thoroughly plausible. It should have served as a wake-up call to this guy to really open his eyes.<br/><br/>Then we have David in a mask and I begin to think now he's in for some serious character development forced by his circumstance. Nope. We get a man so bound up in his mirror image that the only thing he can muster is rage at his doctors who cannot perform miracles and spiraling self-pity. It is an unsparingly rough portrait of someone who is truly, spiritually bankrupt, whose money cannot buy him what he desperately needs and who chooses suicide because of it. That he chooses suicide is a very harsh indicator of character in itself. He opts out because his greatest love-object, himself, has been destroyed. (Yes, he did ""lose"" what he thought was going to be ""the Love"" of his life, but how many others had there been before who were also going to be ""the love""? Cruz/Cruise didn't know one another long enough for him to be that heartbroken, did they? Did they so easily exhaust the possibilities of playful, exploratory, romantic conversation during their one night together that they had to resort to watching latenight infomercials to fill the void? By the way, a thawed poodle isn't the most comforting way to advertise Cryogenic suspension.) But there's more. It doesn't get better, though.<br/><br/>All the silly subplots, flashbacks and misdirection come in. These add nothing whatsoever to this character who begins unsympathetic and remains the same until the very bad ending. Throughout all of these shenanigans I alternately cringed and laughed at the dialogue, the acting and the hopelessness of it all. I only wanted it to be over. In the middle of the muddle we're given the lucid dream romance between Sofia (Cruz) and David. After 9 or 10 hours together in real life David is able to convincingly and satisfyingly imagine the full person of Sophia -- who had kicked his disfigured butt to the curb -- and have a giddy romance. Whatever little we might know about the real Sofia,  the one David imagines is little more than a cute caricature. Remember who drew the most accurate caricature when they drew portraits of one another? All David could draw was an excruciatingly faithful rendering of her surface beauty. He may have been blind, but she certainly wasn't.<br/><br/>Why am I bringing this up? Because the points this movie tries to make it so neatly refutes at the same time. She rejects him. He has her anyway in a dream sequence wherein he also gets his face back. Both characters are redeemed without effort. Actually Sofia is nothing more than an object being manipulated in David's dream, an object without a will or persona other than what he wants/needs. He recreates her as a compassionate elfin creature who loves him despite his wretchedness. (Gotta tell ya, this sort of line can even touch me if it's honest . . . crypto-romantic fool that I am.) Heck, he even gets to have a bit of revenge against Julie in this dream, but this only comes after he's begun to confuse Sofia with Julie. The truth of this confusion might be that, after awhile, he recognizes them as essentially the same and interchangeable: glittering, distracting objects of desire at opposite ends of the spectrum of  hot infatuation and bored disillusionment. But again this is more of David's projection of his own undeveloped nature onto the shallow objects he desires. He just doesn't see himself as the problem. In this complete rejection of the reality that drove him to suicide he gets his way without any personal change. Look, I know this is a remake, but ""Shallow Hal"" is still in the theaters!!<br/><br/>An aside: Cryogenics. When this supposed ""science"" first popped up in the seventies I recall that the subject has to be frozen before brain death which occurs within 3 to 6 minutes after bodily death. If David dies by overdose in his apartment, or on the street outside the club where Penelope Cruz has rejected him, as the Tech Support guy seems to suggest, he's not going to get frozen until long after he's brain dead. Another thing is that dreaming, lucid or otherwise, is not a possibility in a brain that's cryogenically frozen: there is no cellular/neuronal activity. (Kind of how I felt after leaving the theater.)<br/><br/>My point with this is that science fictional elements are usually foolish and dishonest when wrenched outside the genre with little forethought other than to use them as appalling plot gimmicks that serve absolutely no deepening of insight into character but to purposely sidestep it and provide some supposed sense to what's gone on before. This guy had 150 years of dream-state but he never came close to any questions about his own flawed, vacuous sense of identity? This is one of the myriad themes of dreams. (And need we even mention the wasted efforts of his ego-generated ""psychologist"" to pierce his vanity, let alone address the issues of his supposed sanity? Poor Kurt Russell.) So he now has the opportunity to rejoin life with a surgically restored face and all's well in the universe. His money, now dwindling, has bought him an out after all!! If this is a suggestion of rebirth or redemption it is muddled, sentimental, cheap and pointless. When he takes that cocky plunge off the building's ledge in the final scene do we have any doubt that this is the very same guy from the beginning of the movie? Ok, he may have been punished in dreamland, but there wasn't a hint of new self-knowledge. His travails were all presented from his position of a tragic victim who neither faces his possible culpability nor surmounts his disfigurement and altered life with any higher insight.<br/><br/>The ultimate question may be whether we should feel anything for or identify in any way with the character of David Aames that doesn't arise from whatever associations we have of Tom Cruise. Aames is not a sympathetic or interesting character in his own rights. Fans of Tom Cruise or Cameron Crowe may feel otherwise. Since I'm not a fan of either -- I certainly have nothing against them -- I didn't get much from this movie. David Aames never really opens his eyes, no matter how many times he stared into that mirror. And if the entire movie was simply David's dream nothing new or interesting in movie-making style or real thematic substance was shown to justify the whole endeavor: the entire movie was merely a not-too-interesting diversion with no ""deeper"" meaning.<br/><br/>And furthermore: the score. It got loud and obtrusive especially when the director, Cameron Crowe, began to throw my music in there. Hey, I have my own associations with popular songs that didn't jibe with what was on the screen at all and pulled me further away . . . thankfully.<br/><br/>And then there's the other offer on the roof. Being in one's own cozy dreamworld for eternity is a subversive form of hell that would only appeal to a self-centered narcissist: to repeat all the static and empty combinations of feelings, memories and influences of one's past life without the hope of growth, enlightenment or change. To mention another film that many on IMDB have linked to Vanilla Sky thematically -- The Matrix -- this option is precisely the hell that movie's protagonists were set upon destroying: a machine-generated nirvana. It is quite punny that what we have in Tech Support is god as machine who offers a painless, happy solution to David's dilemma. It's a solution that restores to him all he's lost, from a god of technology we have created that asks for no evolution in return. David's remained so one-dimensional it's too late to care, though.<br/><br/>This movie may have had some potential, but frittered it all away for what .. . I have no idea. Actually, since I wasn't expecting a deeply thought-provoking movie I was more annoyed than anything else. That's why I've written all this mess: this mess of a movie messed around in a too-dishonest fashion when it never needed to. And I paid for this??!! But the memory of all us opening weekend zombies shuffling out of that dark theater, hushed and reluctant to look each other in the face because of our embarrassment from that movie's ending . . . That memory will last.  4/10 stars<br/><br/>I do have to say yea! to that final scene on the roof for one thing: its spectacular view of lower Manhattan from a vantage point higher than, and looking down upon, the now lost twin towers. It was a sort of wonderful yet elegiac view."

","This is more of a comparative essay than review.  I've now seen this film and its predecessor (Abre Los Ojos) in that order, and I might be in the minority, but I have to say that Crowe has made the superior film.  What evolves in both movies seems to call for a more ambiguous plot, filled with, dare I say it (and this is the best I can describe it) gobbletygook.  The Spanish film seems much more straightforward, and is a very entertaining film in its own right, but I feel like Alejandro Amenabar skimmed over plot points that made Vanilla Sky much more effective.  The chemistry between Cruise and Cruz was much more apparent than what we see in the same scenes between Cruz and the male lead in Open Your Eyes.  And Crowe gives much more attention to Cameron Diaz' psychotic character than Amenabar does with the 'other woman' in his film, and what would posess her to stalk this man and attempt to kill him along with her.  And in Open Your Eyes, we learn next to nothing about this man's career, and if Amenabar was trying to show it, the character's image and what would posess him to have a brief sexual encounter (but the scene in which the male lead and Cruz illustrate one another would say that's not what the director was going for).  I just think Crowe has made his characters much more human, even though Vanilla Sky is often the much more frustrating film.  Granted, this is Amenabar's sophomore effort, and certainly didn't have nearly the budget to work with.  I'd be curious to know whether he wanted to make a longer film ('Sky' exceeds Open Your Eyes' running time by a good 25 minutes or so).  But please judge for yourself. They're both good films - Vanilla Sky may be a great one.  Cameron Crowe is one of the best filmmakers of our generation and it's too bad not enough people see it (box office returns clearly cost Almost Famous the attention and some of the awards it deserved).  Cameron Diaz deserves a best supporting actress nomination."

","Contains Spoilers Too many times in film history are we handed the classical narrative structure on a silver platter. American audiences walk in to cinemas expecting some laughter, some tears, all wrapped up in a neat little package to finish the job.<br/><br/>But why?  It's our format.  But how long can happiness last?  Does life really become constant when we are locked in that 'happy' or 'satisfied' state that we bring from the theater?  The truth is, there are no happy endings.  Oh, there are very happy moments, but nevertheless, life continues to push on in its seemingly malevolent way.<br/><br/>Why not, says Crowe, leave the audience with something to ponder.  Why not leave them with something to discuss over dinner, something to lie awake at night wondering.  Why simply feed aesthetic desires to encourage us to blink the event out of our minds.  Film, above all mediums, must move us in a way we have never been moved before. It must divert our desires, feeding them gradually but never giving us the whole pie in one serving.<br/><br/>You may criticize ""Vanilla Sky"" as a one shot attempt for some big name actors to remake an already extant film. You may criticize it as an excuse to dissipate the classical narrative structure, because it's easier to confuse people than create a coherent plotline. It's easier to just shoot confusing garbage than find some symbolic means to link everything together. Well, you'd be dead wrong.<br/><br/>""Vanilla Sky"" is a film which stands in a genre all its own:  Surface Surrealism.  As the surrealists believe, film is a dream, and this film is fully aware that it acts on dreams to create its own reality.  Anything can, and does, happen.<br/><br/>Now I ask you this. When was the last time, in a dream, did something confusing or astonishing, shocking or tormenting, or so blatantly against every moral code you ever stood for, happen?  Laws, morals, and above all, physics cease to exist in your dreamworld--your dreams explore POSSIBILITIES.<br/><br/>There is nothing wrong with this. Dreams can momentarily confuse you, frustrate you. They can cut you deep, they can reoccur and disrupt your life.  How many times have you dreamt about someone and then faced them the following day?  How many times did you experience something in your own life that you could swear you dreamt only the night before, or many months ago?<br/><br/>The problem in criticizing this film for being confusing lies in our own minds.  So the film did not conform to what we expect.  And why not?  It acts on the science of dreams. And sometimes, inside of us, there are dreams that we would never dare share with the world.  Respect the ones that did."

His friends and those around him do see it but he himself gives a 'rational' explanation to all he is witnessing - which of course is irrational to the viewer.<br/><br/>One example of this is when he is at the nightclub with Sofia and she makes a statement that is repeated by David at the end of the film. When he speaks it to her she looks at him as if she doesn't know what he is talking about. The more he talks about what he heard her say the more unsettled she becomes. Even his friend, played by Jason Lee, talks about how he has changed after the accident and making comment of David's weird behavior at the nightclub.<br/><br/>This along with all the times he makes references to madness, ""They're driving me nuts"" ""She's making me crazy"", etc. gives a fresh different perspective on how madness can infect someone's rational mind to the point that it becomes their entire world."

It feels as if they were trying for a ""Sixth Sense"" style surprise ending but they have become pretty much standard these days so unless its especially well executed it doesn't really surprise.

","Vanilla Sky is disappointing on so many levels.<br/><br/>I like Cameron Crowe.  I've liked every one of his movies so I was really looking forward to this one.  But ultimately I feel like this material was better served by a different director and a different cast.  At times it feels like a music video and at other times feels like a terribly miscast David Lynch movie.<br/><br/>The dreamy quality of the story and the lack of answers up front beg comparisons to Lynch. But unlike Mr. Lynch who, in his recent movies, has provided some pretty dense and meaning-laden (or meaningless? - up to you) stories, utterly and totally lacking in overt explanation, Mr. Crowe feels the need to justify all of the weirdness of all we've been watching with (what feels like) a tidy 15 minute monologue near the close of the film. You can argue that Lynch's films suffer from the weirdness and lack of explanation, but you can't deny the conviction with which the movie is made - Lynch doesn't seem to CARE whether or not you get it.  Crowe, it seems, WANTS you to get it and as a result, Vanilla Sky's explanation feels like a second, borderline-unrelated movie that only serves to hedge on the movie's buildup and make the movie that much more frustrating. <br/><br/>
I was honestly bored throughout the film, not caring much about the characters or their relationships.  Most of the characters had only as much dimension as was required to tell the story - never fully busting out into rounded people.  The film's explanation may explain this lack of character depth, but not in a way that serves the story while you're actually watching it.  So in spite of these problems, what kept me in the theater was the anticipation of the mind-blowing ending that was promised - an ending that could potentially make me reexamine and appreciate everything that had thus far bored me.  That ending was never delivered.  Instead of being thrilled or invigorated or inspired by the ending, I was simply relieved it was over.<br/><br/>In all fairness, this movie is remade from a Spanish film that I have not seen.  I don't know if it's a truly faithful adaptation and the problems I have with the story were inherent with the original, or if perhaps Crowe made choices that bogged down the original's intent.  <br/><br/>I will say without hesitation that with original material, Crowe still has a solid batting average, but this movie is a slow-rolling infield groundout. Disappointing."

","It took me a while to understand why those who viewed it before me said Vanilla Sky was bizarre but by the end I totally agreed.   <br/><br/>The fact that Tom Cruise's character is such an unlikeable guy is a testament to his acting.  His portrayal of a wounded, tormented man was very good.  Cameron Diaz and Jason Lee were also very good.  I loved Kurt Russell as the shrink and found myself rooting for him to make a difference in the film.  Penelope Cruz has some good moments but her speech patterns detract from her lines.  It is not the accent, for I find accents appealing.  She could use a speech therapist to help her change her speech errors! <br/><br/>It is not an erotic thriller as it is advertised but rather a very dark, bizarre, somewhat despairing film with some great performances.  <br/><br/>I do not enjoy foul language or scenes that cause viewers to become voyeurs.   Although the sex scenes are important to the plot they were overdone. I feel conflicted by the  bizarre plot twists and darkness of this film in terms of recommending it to others.  I definitely do not recommend it to anyone under 20.  I do feel some of the performances were worth watching.  Perhaps my conflicts could be soothed if I recommend seeing it only for matinee prices!"

Unfortunately, for those sleuths out there, you'll be able to figure it out quite quickly.  The main theme has been done in 3 sci-fi/action movies already, with the ending almost practically taken straight out of one of them. However, the way it is presented is quite fresh. If you happen to figure it out, at least the actors give good performances to sustain the movie.  Cruise as the playboy who still is searching for more, Diaz as the cold and empty seductress, and Cruz as the very likeable, down to earth love interest.  This is not your typical love triangle as the commercials lead you to believe, but in addition to the so called main ""twist"", it also effectively covers a variety of sub themes that would make you want to see this movie a second time to find out what these sub themes were again, since you might be too busy figuring out the main plot.

","I have to say that despite the fact that he may be a control freak, or that he blatantly lied about the danger level of the stunts he performed on Mission Impossible 2, Tom Cruise very rarely appears in a bad film. The only film that I can think of that I really didn't like was the afore mentioned Mission Impossible 2.He may not be the best actor, but he is aware of his limitations and unlike that fat ass Travolta he can pick a good entertaining script.<br/><br/>Vanilla Sky is no exception, the film itself is a good twisted tale that provokes thought even though it really doesn't give you a chance to figure anything out. The hardest thing about figuring out what happened is that although it is explained at the end the explanation is given, as Ebert points out in his review, by a character that you can't and shouldn't trust, so you are left kind of twisting in the wind. Now, as mentioned before Tom Cruise is good, watching him I realized that he can be funny, or at least he can play his lines in a humorous way. there were a couple of times I laughed out loud and each time it was either the way he said something, like, ""ummm, yeah thats good, cause for a moment there I thought we were talking about a F*****G MASK!!!!""<br/><br/>or just by his "" what the f*** is going on look"" like in the car with Cameron Diaz or near the conclusion in a scene with Diaz again, where he really can't believe what is happening. The guy is just funny, I don't think he gets enough credit. Think of Magnolia, he can take a small moment, like, standing in the doorway of his dying father's home,and uttering to Phillip Seymour Hoffman's male nurse, as he is being rushed by the dogs of the house "".... Im going to drop kick the F*****G dog"".<br/><br/>So I must say that despite trying not to like him on film I must say that I am a Crusie fan, he may not be Al Pacino but he sure is damn funny.<br/><br/>Other notables about Vanilla Sky: The soundtrack is great, Diaz gives a good performance, you get to see Penelope Cruz's naughty bits, and Jason Lee is, well, he is Jason Lee."

","I've waited nearly a month to post my thoughts on this movie, so we'll see if I can pull this off in a coherent fashion ....<br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie quite a bit, the latest offering from Cameron Crowe. Aside from using the music from his record collection, there aren't any similarities between this movie and his previous efforts. This is a sweeping story that blurs the lines of perception, and, I will admit, requires a little bit of patience from the viewer.<br/><br/>David Aames (Cruise) wants it all, even after it is taken away. Getting it back leads to a blurring of lines that leaves him confused, even petrified. Once he realizes what it costs to have a second shot at what he wanted, a choice for regularity is presented. And for Mr. Aames, the guy who seems to lose the most when his face is destroyed, still has a hard time with the decision.<br/><br/>The second half of the movie is very intriguing, although I found it quite confusing at one point. I will want to watch this a second time, but not until it comes out on DVD. I guess I didn't like it THAT much. What is real, what is not .... what is happening? Those were the questions I was asking myself. And for the most part, it made sense in the end. The resolution was spelled out in blunt fashion -- that is one complaint I had with the movie. Over explained; telling, not showing.<br/><br/>The thing that worked for me is that the disjointed feel during the second half (or post-accident, if you will) reminded me of some of my own dreams, in theory.

","Here we have a mismatch of director and genre.  Cameron Crowe's warm, offbeat, and well-observed comedies put some pretty interesting characters onscreen who ring true in all sorts of little ways that make us love them or at least sympathize with them (if they are supposed to be badguys, but no one is truly bad in a Cameron Crowe movie).  He has a gift for capturing the innocence of awkwardness and a keen ear for dialogue.  He uses music to rhapsodize his scenes in memorable ways (e.g., ""In Your Eyes"" from ""Say Anything"", ""Tiny Dancer"" from ""Almost Famous"", that lovely Bruce Springsteen song in ""Jerry Maguire"", and the entire ""Singles"" soundtrack).<br/><br/>All that said, watching ""Vanilla Sky"" is an uncomfortable experience, and in all the wrong ways.  Crowe proves clumsy when trying to weave an engaging mystery while doing the things he has always done to make a good movie. It's hard to have the warm fuzzies about characters when they're trapped in a trippy world that's hard to understand.  Crowe never seems to get the tone right, although Tom Cruise does all he can to do that tightrope walk between agony and ecstasy and cockiness and vulnerability that he has practically copyrighted.  Jason Lee only adds to the movie's awkwardness by stretching far beyond his range (he really needs to stick to comedy--as a dramatic actor he has two modes:  wise-cracking acerbic smart ass and yelling acerbic smart ass).  Penelope Cruz is just kinda there as the woman Cruise loves, but Cameron Diaz does some fine work in a thankless role of the jilted lover who bobs back and forth between flirtation, sadness, loneliness, desperation, jealousy, and finally rage.<br/><br/>""Vanilla Sky"" is the kind of movie that you want to like because of how well it might have worked in different hands (and conversely, for the hands that dared to take it on in a bold step in a new direction career-wise).  In the end, though, it just leaves you feeling cold and like you've gotten nowhere."
"shark-43","6","0","0","27 December 2001"," Not Bad Remake
","SPOILERS ALERT I was a big fan of the original film ""Open Your Eyes"" and not because it itself is a perfect thriller. It actually was a bit of a mess, but also a daring, thrilling and interesting mess. Anytime a filmmaker decides to work in the area of dreams/reality/dream state - they can become lazy because of the freedom this genre allows. Something not quite making sense - something not quite pulled off??? Oh well - it's a dream. I can totally understand how Cruise would see the original and think., ""Man, I could play the hell out of this guy"" and he does. Cruise gives a good performance and this remake is actually better then I thought it would be but...<br/><br/>(SPOILERS AHEAD+++++++++++++++++++++++++YE BE WARNED+++++): ...THE WAY EITHER CRUISE AS A PRODUCER OR CROWE OR THE STUDIO insisted on how things MUST be explained (and overexplained) for that matter, is insulting to adult audiences. The Spanish film laid it out there for YOU to decide what really happened and this film should have done the same. But obviously someone said NO - we must explain - we must paint a sign for the audience so that ends up being quite a letdown. The film is very well cast and Cruz (who is never as good in English as she is in her native tongue) probably gives her best performance in a Hollywood film (of course she's already played this girl in the original and she is as sparkling in this one as in Amenabar's version). The real surprise is Cameron Diaz's work. The role is a bit underwritten (or maybe trimmed down in the final cut) but she really gives dimension to what could be the one-note psycho stalker. When you think of her work in Being John Malkovich, Charlie's Angels and now this - she really shows she can bring good work to almost any kind of film : art house, action blockbuster, etc. By reading some of the other comments, i can see that many people don't want to be challenged by a film, they don't want to have to do any work as they watch a film, and that's fine. I understand that. But carp about it when a film DOES try and make you think. There are plenty of other mindless films out there, God Knows, so when movies like Lantana, Vanilla Sky, Innocence or even Mulholland Drive try and work outside the normal constraints of Hollywood movie making, give them a tip of the cap. My one other complaint with Crowe (who I admire very much) is he really has to stop with the wall to wall rock song soundtrack. We all know his Rolling Stone Magazine background, we know his wife is Nancy Wilson Heart, but there were many moments in Vanilla Sky where you DID NOT need a song to remind you what feeling might be needed. It was a bit much - trust a scene to work without the pop song hook. 6 out of 10 stars but worth a viewing."

","I love bad movies. This is a good bad movie. And what makes this a good bad movie is that I have never seen such a clearly terrible movie take it self so seriously and honestly believe it has some deeper message about happiness and life. All this movie can be is an excuse to look at pretty people, and boy, are they pretty.<br/><br/> It opens with some well shot sequences. Cruise's pretty boy Richie Rich character, David Aames, drives his silver porshe out into eerily deserted New York City streets. We soon find out it's a dream, which tries to clue the audience in that we're never quite sure what is real and what is fantasy. And when we are watching his real life, it is such a fantasy for your average Joe audience member to see how the other half live (a tv that collapses into the ground! A real Monet painting! More than one apartment in the same building!)<br/><br/> In the first act, as we are introduced to the main characters, I truly did enjoy the boisterous performances from the cast. Cameron Diaz is radiant. Jason Lee is very believable as the slightly jealous but understanding best friend. Even Penelope Cruz, whose nasal semi-english speak is taxing to the ear, fits very well into the dreamer, life-loving dancer role.<br/><br/> No one could have played David Aames like Tom Cruise. That is, the David before the accident. Diaz's ""stalker"" sex buddy just can not take not being loved anymore and crashes her car with David in it. As a result, David's pretty face is disfigured and scarred. When this is handed to Tom Cruise he seems to only know how to run with it in the straight line cliche of Angry Guy. When he goes to a club and orders a Bud and tequila shot, the bartender doesn't look David in the face. David's angry response is, ""look at my face, Bitch"". Is it too much for Cruise to tone it down a level? A little more subtlety from his performance is not a lot to ask for. He is either cocky rich boy or angry disfigured man and no in between.<br/><br/> Once he becomes disfiguered the film turns into the bad good movie filled with laughably bad dialogue and uncomfortably awkward scenes. Hearing Cruz's character, Sophia, blurt out, ""We'll be together in another life, when we are cats"", caused not only me, but the whole audience to chuckle in that, ""What the...??..??"" way. And any film that uses the all too obvious character that wears a mask (as David does at some points) is just using a cliche crutch. Watching David be analyzed by Kurt Russell's psychiatrist character is like watching a bad bad play written by a bad bad writer. Shrouded in darkness, wearing his mask, David is prodded with such in depth questions as, ""What is happiness to you?""<br/><br/> And I don't think we ever really find out what is happiness to his character."

","This film was absolutely phenomenal, and moves on to be twice as good each time I watch it.  First, I appreciated the brilliant acting of Tom Cruise. Jason Lee was funny(sometimes: not his typical character) and Penelope Cruz was also very good, but Tom Cruise carried this film in my opinion with his heart felt emotions constantly running wild.  It's like they ran right off the screen, touched my soul, and then the visual effects just made me go WOW.  If Stanley Kubrick hadn't passed on, I would almost think that he had something to do with this film as the photography, the art, and the demented look of Tom Cruise after his accident were all very Kubrickesque.  Even if you have no patience for the story, just watching this will make you admire all of the work that goes into putting a gem, onto the big screen.  The art and visuals make this movie worth seeing as many times as it takes you to fully understand it, and once you do, you will be even more amazed."

","First of all it is not contructive to completely write off this movie, regardless of it's shortcomings. It deserves credit just for being able to include some interesting shots and direction which are often absent from mainstream films, most notably Times Square and the nightclub scene.<br/><br/>Even though it seems to be said with each successive movie, Cruise proves he can act, while Cameron Diaz is great as the seductive Julie.

The whole L.E thing is part of his dream. He wasn't disfigured and there certainly wasn't any accident of the car.<br/><br/>David's subconcious mind had played tricks on him, challenging his guilt of seeing Sophia and 2-timing Cameron Diaz.<br/><br/>Somehow he came to this dream after he met Sophia, which I suspect was during the time spent in Sophia's house.

","Another ripoff of Sixth Sense, which was really a Jacobs Ladder ripoff. Trick ending.<br/><br/>I am a really big Cameron Crowe fan, so I was really looking forward to this movie. He usually can get the most out of his actors. Even Tom Cruise was good in Jerry Maguire. And that's no easy feat!! But the dialogue in this movie really killed it for me. Cruise and Cruz never have a real conversation till the movie is nearing the end. Most of it is empty, vapid blather. ""I am an arms dealer"" ""Oh really"" or ""I would love to be this mole on your chest"" Just empty and vapid.<br/><br/>Lots of Tom Cruise's teeth though. The usual smile.<br/><br/>I understand the need for the mask, but it got really annoying after awhile. Some will say I'm an idiot for this one, but this probably could have been done without his disfigurement. I can hear all of your comments as fans of this movie will strongly disagree. But thats the way I feel.<br/><br/>I just hope that Cameron Crowe will go back to his usual style of film making. Almost Famous gets better every time I see it. Singles and Say Anything are classics. To Cameron Crowe I say ""Go Back"""

","Much like a great painting, I let the experience of this movie wash over me. I took in the breathtaking sights and sounds. It was an assault of a dream. And like a dream it feels exhilarating and frustrating at times. It truly is a film that will displease many a viewer. It takes on elements of romance, character study, dream voyage, and sci-fi. Perhaps a heady mix some would rather not do with. But I loved it. It's a strong, risky performance by Cruise who takes us on a journey through one man's mind and soul as he tries to figure out who he is amidst all the loneliness and confusion. He's a man engulfed in wealth and power who ends up stripped of everything and awash in dream and pop culture. It reminded me of the movie THE GAME by way of WAKING LIFE. But make no mistake, this is Cameron Crowe's vision of life. Twisted, lonely, deeply romantic, full of all things american, musical, and cinematic. It's a journey worth taking."

","WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS!<br/><br/>It's rare that a film is so bad that I'm actually tempted to leave the theater, but Vanilla Sky was one of those movies that kept me wondering if I might be missing something good on C-SPAN-II.<br/><br/>Let's be honest -- Vanilla Sky is no grand achievement. It's no more a profound, psychological exploration of reality than a Thomas Kinkade print is an example of authentic art. Instead, it's an incoherent and ambiguous mindgame that pretends to be film noir with its intricate direction and cinematography.<br/><br/>The film begins with great potential  a story of redemption from the emptiness of inherited wealth and power. But within 30 minutes we find ourselves on a painfully slow roller coaster that unexpectedly dumps us into a science fiction story that has remarkable parallels to Paul Verhoeven's Total Recall, right down to the last-minute efforts of `tech support' to save our hero. It's almost as if the writers  in a desperate effort to work their way out of a convoluted and otherwise irresolvable plot  had to introduce a significant new element (the Life Extension `twist') with practically no warning at all.<br/><br/>When a movie's plot is weak, I look to its characters with the hope of finding some redeeming value to my $8 investment. (That's how I justified Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes.) But even here, Vanilla Sky falls short. Tom Cruise's real-life charm and million dollar smile prevent us from ever truly disliking him, yet the movie's opening scenes position David Aames as a shallow, smarmy rich kid. Fortunately for us, the mask he wears after the car accident hides that charm and allows Cruise to explore the depths of David's emerging psychosis. Are we supposed to like him? Does he deserve our sympathy? Ultimately, I just didn't care.<br/><br/>If she's not careful, Cameron Diaz runs the risk of inheriting the `Tom Cruise Charm Factor.' She's still as cute as she was as Kimmy in My Best Friend's Wedding, so Diaz really has to stretch to elicit anything beyond our delight at her presence on screen. Fortunately, she's reasonably successful here as David's neglected and demented love toy, and I wished the writers had spent more time exploring her character (whatever that means in light of the film's meaningless ending), especially given the hint we're given of Julie's genuine love for David.<br/><br/>Penelope Cruz's performance as the innocent player in this mess was surprisingly good, although I doubt she could pull off a role that required more depth and emotion, what with her thick (but seductive) accent. The writers missed the opportunity to use Sofia's authenticity and optimism to show David the meaning of life.<br/><br/>In the end, Vanilla Sky is about as deep as a roadside puddle. Somehow these `it was all just a dream' endings leave me feeling unsatisfied and eager for a brisk walk. Oh well, at least we get a good sountrack out of it."

","I'm not seeing this film popping up in many ""10 Best"" lists, or in the Golden Globe nominations, for that matter.  Pity...<br/><br/>I saw this film last week, and found it nicely exceeded my admittedly low expectations.  In a year where most of the successful blockbusters seemed to be kiddie-fare (""Shrek"", ""Harry Potter""), it was refreshing to see a good, adult movie that didn't have to hit you over the head with a sledgehammer to underline its various plot-points.<br/><br/>I liked the challenging nature of the story, and I found I enjoyed it best when I just let it sort of ""wash over me"", instead of trying to analyze every detail and plot point.  And while I wouldn't go so far as to call it profound, it WAS a nifty piece of story-telling.<br/><br/>I do have quibbles; the ""elevator"" scene near the end goes into WAY much detail to explain what has happened, and winds up insulting the thoughtful viewer's intelligence when the movie had done such a wonderful job of depending on it up to that point.<br/><br/>Even with this, though, I liked and admired Vanilla Sky.  Its labrynthine narrative is a BIG departure for director Cameron Crowe, even with its artistic ambitions manages to be approachable and entertaining.  When my wife and I left the theatre we talked for a good hour or so just trying to piece together exactly what happened.<br/><br/>A last note: I've seen some mention of the presence of the World Trade Center twin towers in the background skyline in the rooftop scene at the end.  While this was very much a background detail with NO relevance to the story whatsoever, and while seeing it was a little distracting, I'm glad it was left in.  I'm sure there was much handwringing at Paramount over whether to digitally alter those frames, and the argument could be made that doing so would have been appropriate, but it stands almost as a small, cinematic memorial.  This may well be the last new film we'll see that uses the image of the twin towers as simple buildings, and not as symbols of tragedy."

","This is not a great movie, but it held my attention for the most part.<br/><br/>Cameron Crowe is generally very much an actor's director, but he went into the stratosphere with the script and it's hard to tell if he succeeded or not.  I suppose I'd like to see it again to make sure! In light of the views of reality in this movie, I'd be curious to see what he would do with Neil Gaiman's American Gods, should that novel ever be optioned for a film.  And I'd definitely like to rent the Spanish film that served as the film's inspiration and supplied the ever-evocative Penelope Cruz as the female lead, playing the same part she had in the original (is that the first time this has ever happened?).<br/><br/>Tom Cruise really did not impress me in this movie, with the exception of one scene very near the end.  I'm not sure what it is about Cruise - he's given some incredible performances in a few movies, notably Born on the Fourth of July and Jerry Maguire.  He and Crowe work well together.  He was a convincing narcissist during the first third of the film, but he really had enormous trouble playing a man whose life was ruined.<br/><br/>******SPOILERS/SPOILERS/SPOILERS**********<br/><br/>The very first voice you hear in the movie is Penelope Cruz saying ""Open Your Eyes.""  But, ""in reality,"" Tom Cruise is having a dream and hasn't met the character of Sofia ""yet.""<br/><br/>The next voice you hear is Cameron Diaz saying the same thing, only this time it's ""reality.""<br/><br/>That made me think that, perhaps, the whole movie was one long dream.<br/><br/>Reality is a little skewed in any case.  In an early scene, Tom Cruise's car has an inspection sticker with a date of ""2/30/01."" Late in the movie, what is ""reality"" and what is ""the dream"" are explained.  Various red herrings are revealed and discarded - or are they? The last thing you hear is yet another female actress saying ""Open your eyes"" at the very end of the movie.

","It is difficult to not draw comparisons to the recent film, abre los ojos, while viewing this pretentious work. The fact remains; it is an inferior film due to its overdose of ideas haphazardly thrown into the original piece from alejandro amenabar. the ideas and themes are outrageously inconsistent, as is the juxtapositions of dramatic visuals and silly music (Joan Osborne references). not to say that the soundtrack is not amazing, it is, but it overwhelms the scenes rather than adding to them. the dialogue (and visual) references to radiohead, bjork and Jeff Buckley were misplaced and unnatural, as though he wanted to prove he really is connoisseur of good music. though taste in music does not come in handy in filmmaking without the ability to apply that music to visuals tastefully. emotions were torn from scenes, and Crowe's additions to the original dialogue merely added to that juxtaposition in dramatic scenes. such as Kurt Russell's character being asked his daughter's names without responding, the audience was laughing rather than being enthralled with the scene. Crowe added to the hints of the ending rather than subduing them in dialogue and scenery (ala fight club) when the original film was subtle and more intellectual. people might say this is less of a mainstream film, when it shows all the qualities of mainstream filmmaking (i.e.: spoon feeding us all the answers in a short, ending summary) when again the original was more subtle and artistic in its own right. the ""bringing to life"" of the Dylan cover, and usage of ""Monet"" skies, and to kill a mockingbird were extremely inconsistent which nearly rendered them pointless. one must understand that consistency is needed to hold a piece of art together, whether it is in story, theme, or whatever aspect. in this case, the story was coherent and the theme was inconsistent, the latter being Crowe's addition. the camerawork was overdone and sometimes cliché', using a multitude of different ideas and styles throughout the film (ala snatch) and falling short of cohesion. I realize it is making a statement about pop culture icons being a centerpiece of American culture, but he succumbed to his own ideas he added to his movie, like creating a self-parody. David obviously came to a realization in the end, and wanted to throw that idolatry of superficialities away, and he did. that is intelligent, but also more subtle in the original. it is like Crowe made an exaggerated cartoon version of the original to spell out every detail of meaning which he gathered from it. Granted, I was delighted to see it wasn't an utter copy of the original, and brought forth some new ideas and styles than the original, but the ideas often fell flat, in a muddled, pretentious mass of film. So if you want to be spoon-fed a nice and tidy answer to a superior, more intellectual film, watch vanilla sky, the pretentiousness is overwhelming.<br/><br/>Rating: 6/10"

The only suspense I felt throughout the entire movie was worrying abut when it would end. The only eroticism was listening to the couple behind me make out, and the only thrilling part of the movie was when it ended and I could get up and leave.  Several people in the row behind us fell asleep.  Need I say more?"

","This is a very unique and original film that must be watched to be believed. Being a fan of late 1960s pop music I found the use of the music in the film to be quite moving in places. The shocking scence of Tom Cruise making love to the alternating personas of his two past girlfriends backed with the Monkees ""Porpoise Song"" is truly for me an amazing scene that almost makes the film.

","What an ugly mug that Tom Cruise sports in close up after close up in this supposedly intelligent ""thriller"". It is all hopeless to describe and pointless to write about. This is because it is about a character who is so despicable, we WANT him to die! You mean he survived again? GGRRRR! There has never been so much TOM CRUISE in one movie and he can not carry this thing because he is not likable- hardly at all in real life, even less so in this film. The ending is the only thing which really makes this film at all worth seeing but it plays like a long, LONG version of an episode of the Twilight Zone. There is also an element of Spielberg's 'A.I' in here as well as Kubrick's 'Eyes Wide Shut'. In 'A.I.', the main character is also named David and it also ends with a gonzo whopper of a sci-fi finale. Unfortunately for this film, 'A.I.' also had two interesting acts previous to the last one, which this film does not have. Not to strain the Spielberg connection too much, but the guy makes a cameo in 'Vanilla Sky'(why?).All of that said, there are some creepy moments but unfortunately they add up to nil. Also, Cameron Crowe's trademark ""alternative"" sounding rock soundtrack finally spoils the party. Finally when things are getting interesting I hear Sinead O' Connor and I think, ""Oh, this is from that album that bombed"". I am taken out of the story just when it is getting good (at two hours +). Watch this one on late night cable when you are alone in your motel room at the ""Red Roof Inn"" and have nothing better to do. Actually, scratch that. At the ""Red Roof Inn"" you can play Nintendo for 8.50 an hour. THAT would be money well spent."

The performances were strong and Cameron Crowe pulled the strings wonderfully. There were times this movie was a still as a Minnesota lake and others when it was as rough as the Hawaiian surf, and the directing was seamless.<br/><br/>I have to say I am shocked that so many IMDb uses are complaining about ""Vanilla Sky"" being frustrating and overly complicated and leaving audiences unfulfilled. While ""Vanilla Sky"" is certainly full of twists and turns and makes you think a great deal, it's about 100 times less taxing than ""Memento,"" which I consider one of the best movies of the last 10 years.<br/><br/>I have yet to see original, foreign version of this movie, but I certainly look forward to doing so. Again, there are those who are bitching and moaning about this version paling in comparison to the original.

Wouldn't be surprised to see it get one, wouldn't be shocked if it didn't.

"Benj1285","8","0","0","20 December 2001"," A trip for the mind, Crowe pulls of this surreal film
","Vanilla Sky is a haunting and beautiful masterpiece from Cameron Crowe. This film was an interesting move for Cruise and Crowe, especially Crowe whose films include Almost Famous and Jerry Maguire. For a movie called Vanilla Sky (which describes how Monet painted his skies) I was expecting a more surreal experience. The dream sequences didn't blend well and can leave the audience scratching their heads. With its large budget they could have taken more use of computer effects to give a truly dreamlike feel. Instead it can feel more like just another murder mystery then the intended journey of the mind. The ending, one of the most hyped parts of the film isn't a new concept and has been used in multiple earlier movies. This doesn't mean I disliked the ending, quite the contrary; it fit the film well and added a whole new dimension to the film. Crowe's look at how pop culture affects our lives and the way it affects our personal views of happiness was masterfully done, especially in the intro of Tom Cruise running through a deserted Time Square. It is impossible to review Vanilla Sky without mentioning the amazing assortment of music laced throughout the film. Each song fits perfectly with each scene whether its Radiohead's Everything in its Right Place or Peter Gabriel's Salisbury Hill. Crowe did an excellent job of choosing a collage of different music, which sets the changing moods of each scene. Was this film as mind blowing as the advertisements say it will be? Not quite. It is hard to advertise this type of film properly. The commercials gave away key parts of the film, which were less effective after seeing them on television a dozen times. Plus the viewer may just ignore the film altogether and not enjoy the ride just waiting for the ending. It is hard for a movie to live up to the hype of (what I believe) is the best movie trailer ever. Not every scene was effective, but Vanilla Sky's concept and attempts to take you somewhere new make it a personal classic. Grade: A-"
"smakawhat","5","0","0","14 December 2001"," A Disapointment
","Being excited once again to catch another Cameron Crowe flic yet again.  The director who brought one of the greatest films of last year into being if not the best (Almost Famous), and the work of Jeremy Macguire, gives us a rework of a Spanish film named Abre Los Ojos (open your eyes).<br/><br/>
However the results of this work pale in comparison unfortunatly to Crowe's previous glorious shining moments.  This twighlight zone, dreamscape of a film ends up being not a fascinating memorable piece of work, but a tedious exercise.  While everything seems to be there, good casting, good actors, and an intriguing story, it doesn't flow.  It seems very choppy and more distintresting.  Vanilla sky has the unfortunate habit of leaving the viewer stranded, instead of letting them hitch on a more intriguing ride.<br/><br/>
Basicaly Tom Cruise is a rich kid with an easy life, and easy beautiful woman he lusts after on one side, until he falls for Penelope Cruz when she comes to his birthday party.  As the film progresses we meet more characters, we are subjected to flashbacks, intercutting of scenes in the future, some in the past, all with that twighlight zone feel and leaving you disoriented (I can't describe more without giving away too much).  In reality we as the viewer soon begin to realize that we see is not the whole truth as the film toys with the idea of is this real? or is it imagined?  While this has been done greatly in films this year like Mulholand Drive, and the BRILLIANCE of films like Memento, Vanilla Sky leaves the viewer unwilling to even care.  Too many of the scenes go on for far too long, and I lost interest several times.  Many times I wanted this film just to end.  The film does make sense to me and I don't think a second viewing would add to my experience, if anything the first viewing was more of a chore, its one thing to watch a film and be motivated and be awed on screen, than to sit through a disoriented piece with no connection.<br/><br/>
Cameron really missed the ball on this one and it's unfortunate.  His touch is there ecspecialy the incorporation of music and scenes (loved the opening scene of empty New York) but in the end this film fails.  So many people in the audience just kept groaning within the last 45 minutes as the scenes and developments kept popping up. I felt their pain.. <br/><br/>Rating 5 out of 10."

","Although I have set myself up as a critic, a professional. I can not objectively discuss Vanilla Sky. It was too emotional an experience for me. I felt every emotion known to man during that chaotic 2 hours. I couldn't get it off my mind days after I saw the movie. Everytime I see the commercial all my feelings of frustration, melancholy and dissatisfaction comeback along with the taste of movie popcorn in my mouth.<br/><br/>The film thick with imagery and symbolism enthralls you from the beginning. By the end of the film you both blame and sympathize with Tom Cruise's character David who goes to hell and back. Only he doesn't get to come back. He just goes to hell. While you're questioning your own reality perhaps with friends over cocktails, you can't help but to recall the turmoil felt by David and feel his emotions as if they were your own. <br/><br/>When the movie was over, I was annoyed and my initial reaction was that the movie was bad. But the Tuesday after the Friday I saw it, I realized that it was still on my mind, every bit of passionate sensation. At that moment I acknowledged that only a truly good film could stay with me that long. I decided I loved it. <br/><br/>I loved it for challenging my sense of logic and order. I loved it for questioning my ideals of film structure and continuity. I loved it for making me angry, happy, sad, frustrated, yes even suicidal at the same time.

","VANILLA SKY / (2001) ***1/2 (out of four)<br/><br/>(WARNING: Depending on what you already know about the film--this article may contain a spoiler. It does not, however, give away the ending.)<br/><br/>By Blake French: <br/><br/>Excluding setting and soundtrack differences, ""Vanilla Sky"" is very similar to ""Open Your Eyes,"" the 1997 Spanish production it is based on. ""Open Your Eyes,"" Alejandro Amenábar's existential thriller, questioned the realm of reality as it combined the filmmaking styles of Stanley Kubrick and David Lynch. ""Vanilla Sky"" blends the thematic depths of the same directors, but the styles of the two movies feel worlds apart. Director Cameron Crowe adds his own ingredients to this complex recipe; his version is more of an update to the original film than a remake.    <br/><br/>With heartwarming movies like ""Almost Famous"" and ""Jerry Maguire,"" we never would have expected a film like ""Vanilla Sky"" from Cameron Crowe. But he expands himself far beyond our expectations with this complex, enigmatic, wonderfully frustrating tale. It's a side of Crowe we have never seen before, and it is a pleasant change of pace.<br/><br/>The film opens with one of the most impressive sequences filmed all year. David Aames (Tom Cruise), sprints down a barren Times Square, frantically searching for any sign of life-but there is none to be found. No digital effects were used to create this shot. The city actually gave ""Vanilla Sky"" permission to shut down Times Square one Sunday so that the shot could be completed. It has an eerie, frantic sensation that digital alterations would not have accomplished.  <br/><br/>David wakes to his luxurious life of wealth and position. He inherited a massive corporation from his father and has been enjoys his power and endless supply of beautiful women ever since. However, his latest bed-buddy, Julie (Cameron Diaz), gets a little too close for his comfort. When she invades his birthday party, David uses his best friend's gorgeous romantic interest, Sofia (Penélope Cruz), as a means to rid himself of her.<br/><br/>The following morning, David finds Julie waiting in her car outside his apartment. She admits to following him, but somehow manages to coax him into her vehicle. In a jealous rage, she admits to loving him, accuses David of using her for casual sex, and drives the speeding car off a bridge, killing Julie and deforming David. But is Julie really dead? Is Sofia even a real person, or is she just a figment of David's imagination? David tries to sort it all out in a prison where he has been charged with a murder he does not remember committing.  <br/><br/>Cameron Crowe fails to breathe life into a few areas of need, where the original film also lacked. For instance, despite engaging performances, we are never convinced that David and Sofia really love each other. The movie lacks passion. We never feel steam or heat from the screen, not even during an especially absent love scene between Cruz and Cruise. The attitude here is much too external; it questions reality, but never emotion.<br/><br/>Also, the movie never shows us the emotion behind David's plastic mask, which he wears to shield his disfigured face. There is a striking scene in a dance club where David wears the mask on the back of his head, making it appear as if he has two faces. A fine metaphor to examine David's vanity, but ""Vanilla Sky"" does not provide the proper foundation.<br/><br/>Luckily, this isn't a movie about passion or emotion, it's about conviction and ideas. It's excellent filmmaking the whole way through, supported by excellent performances. Despite his status, Tom Cruise allows himself to look hideously deformed after the car crash. His powerful character transformation is even more effective. He swings back and forth between bitter depression and tormented rage. The psychological inconsistencies are the centerpiece of the movie. <br/><br/>And Crowe does expand on other areas where ""Open Your Eyes"" failed. ""Vanilla Sky"" creates a style twice as engaging as the original. Crowe dazzles us with brilliant editing and a lively, pop-culture soundtrack that gives the movie a modern edge. Even so, the twist at the end of this movie feels even less appropriate than in the original, perhaps because the film feels so modern. <br/><br/>""Vanilla Sky"" is not like ""Mulholland Drive,"" where no answers are given and there is much room for individual interpretation. This movie does provide an explanation-but it's without foundation or reason. We initially question the answers provided because we expect something more revealing, taut, perplexing. No need to look any deeper than face value. This movie explains every last detail in the finale, and the more it insists on explaining, the less interesting it is. <br/><br/>Despite a disappointing conclusion and a lack of emotional exploration, ""Vanilla Sky"" ranks as one of the best remakes of the year. The movie does exactly what remakes are supposed to do. It pays dues to the original while expanding on the concepts and themes. ""Vanilla Sky"" is not better than ""Open Your Eyes,"" but at least it's on the same par."
"CHendri887","Null","0","0","25 December 2001"," Some amusing moments, but overall a flawed piece of work
","After watching Amenabar's ""Abre Los Ojos,"" I can see why an American director would be interested in playing with the ideas in that film. However, my overall impression of Crowe's ""Vanilla Sky"" is that it is--while somewhat entertaining--in the end not completely satisfying.  First off, I had problems with the way this Spanish film played in an American setting. At its heart, I believe ""Abre Los Ojos/Vanilla Sky"" is a deeply sexist film. It is about the ""femme fatal"", the ""evil woman"" coming back to reek havoc and revenge in the life of a man who slighted her.  It is about men having power over women and women being victims.  Fine.  I can deal with that. However, with the actors chosen and in the less machismo-oriented (than Spain) American setting, I feel like all of the characters are too self-assured, self-responsible and strong for any of this to happen.  For example, I never really believe that Cameron Diaz is needy enough to go to such lengths to hurt Tom Cruise's character.  Likewise, I never really see Tom Cruise as a ""selfish jerk"" (a key premise for the film to work); he just seems like a nice guy victimized by one bad choice.  In ""Abre Los Ojos"", the whole ""femme fetal"" premise works better for me.  In addition, I found other actor choices in ""Vanilla Sky"" to be miscast or perhaps not written well enough.  For example, Kurt Russell as the psychiatrist was just terrible, in my opinion.  I mean, at the end of the film, we're led to believe he was some kind of ""missing father figure"" to Cruise, but all the while he is dealing with Cruise, he can't stop bringing the focus of the conversation onto him, his own ""issues.""  This is the ""perfect father?""  a psychiatrist? I don't get it.  And what is up with movie portrayals of psychiatrists anyway?  There is still a terrible stereotyping that does a great disservice to modern mental health providers.  Likewise, Jason Lee just did not work for me as Tom Cruise's ""buddy.""  I didn't feel the connection between them...and I can't stop seeing Jason Lee as a skater dude or one of Kevin Smith's sidekicks.  Penelope Cruz was better, less annoyingly ""girlish"" than she was in ""Abre Los Ojos"", but it was still hard for me to understand why Cruise's character was so attracted to her initially.  And, as I already mentioned with Diaz, her self-assurance made it hard for me to see her as the ""slighted woman.""  Finally, I felt like, as with many of Crowe's films, there was an underlying arrogance and that the film was really about Crowe himself, not about the characters portrayed.  This first comes across in Crowe's very self-conscious use of ""cool"" electronica-oriented and indy rock favorites such as Radiohead and Jeff Buckley.  Yes, Crowe has ""cool"" musical taste and he wants you to know it.  In addition, lines like ""My favorite Beatle used to be Paul, then it was John.""  ""I always liked George myself."" seemed odd to me coming out of Russell and Cruise's mouths.  In fact, all of the lines about music and art that came out of Cruise's mouth just sounded like they were coming from Crowe's mouth to me.  One more incident:  The flashback to the Dylan album cover also seemed to be more about Crowe than Cruise's character to me.  I mean, Cruise's character is only supposed to be 33 and he would not have even been born when that album came out.  And, I don't know how intentional this was, but Cruise does look a lot like the pudgy Crowe with that ""mask"" on his face.  Coincidence?  Perhaps not. Anyway, I thought ""Vanilla Sky"" was more interesting and well-done than ""Abre Los Ojos"", but it is still an ultimately flawed film.  Not a complete waste, but could have been better."

If I had known it was science fiction I would not have bothered with this movie.  I really resent being lured into the theatre with false advertising.  That said, it was, for the most part, well done. What I did NOT like about the movie itself (even accepting that it was the old bait-and-switch ploy) was Penelope Cruz.  Why, when we have so many beautiful and talented actresses in America, do we need to go scrounging around and digging up `actors' who cannot even speak English?  I really cannot stand to listen to her squeezing our language out through her nose. I do no find it in the least bit charming.  Ditch this dame.  Enough.  Marry her off to the Frito bandito where they can jabber to each other all they want and I don't have to listen to it.

","I was pleasantly surprised by this film.  After seeing a lot of murky or lightweight films this year, this one stands out.  Not a complete masterpiece, as the science fiction aspects are a bit out there, but one of the best I've seen recently. <br/><br/>I have never been a huge fan of any of the big talents in this film.  Tom Cruise movies are often bland and formulaic, and it is painful to watch him smirk his way through yet another big money business deal that takes the form of a movie.  Penelope Cruz does not strike me as any more talented than dozens of other actresses.  Cameron Diaz, well, let's just say that she is best served sticking to light comedy like ""The Mask"" and ""There's Something About Mary.""  So, I was predisposed to not like this film much, which is why I was so pleasantly surprised by it.<br/><br/>""Vanilla Sky"" advances the ball for all concerned.  I found the NYC street scenes just fabulous, particularly the upper West side and Times Square shots that begin the film.  That is the New York City I know, though I've never seen Times Square deserted.  The style is retro to some 60's experimental pieces, which I found to be bold and, oddly, the best way to tell the story.  There aren't wasted scenes or shots here.  Everything counts.  The style is not experimental for the sake of being experimental, but to deliver the story properly.  And it works.  <br/><br/>Tom Cruise is much better here than I can recall.  While he always dominates his films, this is an artistic breakthrough in the way ""Risky Business"" was a career breakthrough (fine work there, too, despite the lightweight script).  It is very difficult to extend your personality through a formless mask, but Cruise manages to do that for about a third of the film.  I wondered at times if maybe Crowe just used a double for those shots to save money, but then Cruise would give a distinctive shrug or flash his eyes and you knew it was him.<br/><br/>My favorite scenes are of Cruise in a disco, lights flashing, people dancing, lost in a crowd of happy people oblivious to his disfigurement after he has survived a car crash.  Given Cruise's fame, he perhaps really understood the character's desire to lose himself in a crowd once in a while.  Even there, he manages to convey a unique presence.  Just an amazing, mature performance.<br/><br/>If Cruise is superb, then Kurt Russell is just as good as a psychologist trying, like us, to figure out what is going on.  He draws you in, just like he intends to draw in Aames so that he can crack the code.  I would say this is Russell's finest work since ""Escape from New York,"" which, like this film, used science fiction simply to set up the real, non-sf story being told.<br/><br/>Normally, I don't like ""artsy"" direction with lots of quick cuts and unanswered questions.  I think it works brilliantly here.  You get a real feeling for the disjointed world that Cruise's character inhabits. Fortunately, answers ultimately are supplied in an ending that manages to startle.  I can understand why release of this film was delayed after the World Trade Center terrorist attacks.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast performs adequately.  Tilda Swinton makes an impact in barely more than a cameo, and Timothy Spall artfully recreates Thomas Mitchell's part as Uncle Billy In ""It's a Wonderful Life.""  Given how the plot turns out, drawing such connections is not outlandish - perhaps that is where Aames drew inspiration for the character.... (That last comment will make no sense until you have seen the film.)  <br/><br/>The focus here really is on the leads, though.  They shine under fine direction of a creative script.  Because the film is a bit unusual, and turns out to be a science fiction film, which the Academy hates, this film probably won't receive many awards.  It deserves them. <br/><br/>
About my comment that Cruise is playing JFK Jr. in a nightmare - notice the huge picture of Aames' dead father in his apartment and how his father's influence dominates his life.  Note the carefree bachelor lifestyle cut short by a disastrous accident with his beautiful blonde lover.  Figure in Cruise's clean-cut good looks.  Sure, the resemblance is not exact, and this tale is from before JFK Jr.'s untimely passing.  But does all that at all remind YOU of any recently deceased celebrity?"

Probably the most notable thing about this film is its unyielding romanticism regarding the universe, which is admirable in any film these days.<br/><br/>This film owes a LOT, though, to David Lynch.  The plot structure, characters, and thematics felt like they were all ripped from Lynch's films. Crowe not so subtly pulls in elements from Blue Velvet, Lost Highway, and the recent Mulholland Drive to tell his story.  This naturally puts Crowe in a harsh light, since his use of the elements is not nearly so masterful as Lynch's.  Instead of a stream of consciousness film about the human condition, we have one that paints itself into a corner and then struggles fervently to get out- although it should be noted that the film DOES succeed, the ending only passes the credibility test by the skin of its teeth.<br/><br/>That said, this is worth seeing.

I'm not sure that it wouldn't have been a better film, had it not merely ended in the manner that it began rather than giving such a twisted (and almost hokey) explanation for the events that unfolded. I think the film had some spectacular moments but Crowe could have excised at least 30 minutes from it - it takes far too long to reach its conclusion. At least Cameron Crowe is trying to reach out beyond mere commercial formula, and though he is indeed a talented director had this been directed by Bunuel it would have been a masterpiece. Penelope Cruz is more than adequate as is the remaining cast. In spite of Tom Cruise ( alright - he's good but there are actors far superior to him) being in the film, I give it 8/10."

Oh well, if there is to be real change in Hollywood toward works that take chances and ask the viewer to engage their mind as well as their emotions, then efforts like Vanilla Sky need to be supported.  So I say go see it. Don't let anyone ""spoil"" it for you before you do, and just let it flow for awhile and it will sort of grow on you.

Personally, I feel that on this premise alone,  ""Vanilla Sky"" is an excellent  example of  Hollywood film-making as high-art.<br/><br/>There was a constant  ""push/pull"" between not only the characters here, but also with what was of the conscious mind and the subconscious mind -- leaving you, the viewer, a fly on the wall looking on as this hyper-real tangle of a story unravels.<br/><br/> There is also a wonderful marriage of music and image in this film. This hybrid will be obvious and welcome in the first minute of watching the opening scene.<br/><br/> That is all I need to say. Anymore would get too specific, and I would hate to give away ANY aspect of this haunting, high-calibre film."

","My initial reaction to my viewing of Vanilla Sky was that I liked it. Though it was not a completely original storyline (it was both a remake of the 1997 Spanish movie ""Abre Los Ojos"" and had Matrix and Sixth Sense elements to it) it was a very intriguing movie. As I left the theater, I turned the events of the movie over and over in my mind. I haven't seen a movie that made me think that much in a long time.<br/><br/>However, there are aspects of the movie that really insulted the viewer. At the end of the movie, the ""tech support"" guy explains the entire movie so completely that it leaves little room for interpretation by the viewer. It insults our intelligence and is reminiscent of the lame ending to another Cruise film ""Eyes Wide Shut.""<br/><br/>Tom Cruise, Cameron Diaz, Jason Lee and Penelope Cruz are all impressive in this movie although their characters (other than Lee) have many holes in them making them hard to understand in some parts of the movie.<br/><br/>
Overall it's a fun movie but not a very good movie. I hope to see Abre Los Ojos to compare and contrast between the two and see which aspects of the Spanish original Cameron Crowe fudged up!<br/><br/>6 1/2 out of 10"

","I have no problem with remakes like Ocean's Eleven as they update old ideas. It is a little harder to accept Hollywood remakes of recent, successful foreign movies. The original is Abre los Ojos, which was made in 1997. What Hollywood does in these cases is a common phenomenon, popularly referred to as theft. That aside, let's concentrate on the movie as it turned out.<br/><br/>Many confusing films have popped up after The Sixth Sense. This is certainly one of them and I have heard many complaints that people left the theatres puzzled. This should, however, not be necessary as I think the plot is very well explained in the end. I even feel a little too much may have been explained, but it is still of the more intelligent sorts of movies. It is highly entertaining and Crowe is a master of portraying warmth and he shows this particularly well in the ending. The problem with the film is that it is originally a Spanish movie. Latino countries often embrace the incredible and the mystical in their movies, and it somehow works better when they make these movies. Here, it feels sort of weird.<br/><br/>Cruise has long ago become a mature and excellent actor. His character in Vanilla Sky is almost as written by Bret Easton Ellis. Pay particular attention to when he is introduced to his new mask by the medical team. The flaw, if I can call it that, with his character is his choice of women. I am skeptical to any person who would choose Penélope Cruz over Cameron Diaz, although that is what Cruise did in real life. Choosing her over Nicole Kidman is not much better though. ;-) Also, Jason Lee and Kurt Russell make good impressions.<br/><br/>This is a high adrenaline movie with excellent music, and if you aren't tired of the Sixth Sense effect yet, this is not a bad bet.<br/><br/>
PS! The introductory scene with Tom Cruise in a completely empty Times Square is not only impressive, it is also quite real. <br/><br/>Rating: 7/10"

","Well, there are some good points to this movie.  Cameron Diaz and Penelope Cruz are lovely ladies.  Diaz has a meaty role as the undervalued lover; Cruz plays the perfect woman about whom all men dream.  Thus, she is not half as interesting as she thinks she is.        This might have been a good romance/psychological thriller if the science fiction elements to the plot had been completely, totally, absolutely omitted.  Sorting out reality and Cruise's dreams could have made for a good movie.  But the incredibly inept sortie into science fiction makes this movie a joke -- and not a very funny one.  The first hour or so of the movie is interesting; the last half hour is ridiculous and boring. The movie might have been worth seeing if a truly interesting and surprising ending had been devised. But it wasn't and this movie was stupid."

","Undoubtedly the best film so far this year, Cameron Crowe's `Vanilla Sky' is one of the all time great American films.  Most of Cameron Crowe's work means nothing to me, but this film shows me that he is a talented force in the film industry. I was so moved by this film I had to write about it I must explain to you how amazing this film was.  The first line of the film if interpreted in different ways changes the whole film.  Vanilla Sky is an all out perfect masterpiece and will rake in some Oscars in March.  The film has a Kubrick like darkness to it and is I think the best film of it's kind since ""A Clockwork Orange.""  It is a story within a story and is quite moving.  I was looking forward to it since I knew Cameron Crowe had something great inside him to make(since I didn't enjoy any of his past films at all).  The camera work by the brilliant John Toll, the great direction from (I now admit) a genius, and ofcoarse the solid acting cast. Let's not leave out one of my personal favorite scripts ever written. Vanilla Sky taps into the great tradition of films like Stanley Kubrick's `A Clockwork Orange,' David Fincher's  `Fight Club,' and the most recent `Memento' and `Mulholland Dr.'  An All out classic and if you loved the film that I just Talked about you will love this brilliant piece of storytelling! SEE  IT!!!  DON'T LEAVE THE THEATER JUST SIT AND WATCH IT!!!!!!  CAMERON CROWE IS A GENIUS!!!!!  THE OSCAR SEASON HAS BEGUN!"
"davidwynnf","Null","0","0","18 December 2001"," Vanilla Sky shuttles Crowe into a great dialogue
","Who would have guessed that Cameron Crowe, with movies like Almost Famous and Jerry Maguire under his belt, would produce a movie like Vanilla Sky? This is not to demean his earlier movies, but Vanilla Sky shows such a surprising side to Crowe's sensibility.  It shows him as a thinking artist the likes of Antonioni and the Ridley Scott of Blade Runner and perhaps, Hannibal.  The company name ""Life Extension"" reminds one of Roy's (Rutger Hauer's) hushed line in Blade Runner, ""More life,""  which is accompanied by the image of Roy's hand gripping the air claw-like in desire for immortality.  The encased broken guitar in David Aames' apartment reminds one of the riotous rock scene in Antonioni's Blow-Up, in which a crowd of rock-lovers goes crazy over a guitar only after the musician breaks it in mid-concert.  This theme of the broken object, be it guitar or human face, is picked up by Crowe and it ushers him to this table where Scott and Antonioni sit babbling their insights into humanity through film.<br/><br/>Also, these three films all interrogate the nature of memory.  From the beginning of his cryo-freeze dream-life, David Aames' life is fashioned completely out of his memories.  Life Extension tries to isolate his ""good memories"", most of which are not from life but from movies Aames saw as a child.  This is a wonderful twist.  Like Deckard's dream of the unicorn in the director's cut of Blade Runner, memory does not refer to ""real"" or authentic experience.  One could conclude from the content of Deckard's and Aames' dreams that one never remembers primal reality, one only ever remembers other memories and impressions, all secondary.  What a wonderful movie."

","Open your eyes. This overly ambitious film (not the sequel to ""Eyes Wide Shut"") gives us so much and asks so little in return. Another Hollywood cruise through dreamland that turns out a nightmare or just another Tom Cruise vehicle?<br/><br/> David Aames ((Tom Cruise) wakens to a NYC beyond his wildest fantasy - a city devoid of people making him the one and only. But that's only a dream... or is it? This self-absorbed magazine-magnate demands your attention. This is a narcissistic heir to a successful publishing house doing his least to promote its rags and his best to advance his own interest. You've met his type - a guy born on third base who thought he hit a triple. Tom Cruise, producer, cast himself in this role and are we surprised. A match made in heaven as we watch him descend to hell.<br/><br/>Vanilla Sky should be sub-titled and programmed for the intuitively challenged. To follow this film in a linear fashion is a prescription for almost as much pain and suffering as our hero experiences without the rewards of both Julie (Cameron Diaz) and Sofia Serrano (Penelope Cruz). The hangover without the fun. This film has more beautiful people per frame than any audience deserves. And Mr. Cruise, please stop mugging to the audience.<br/><br/>The opening line - ""Open your eyes""  -surprisingly the title of the derivative film by Alejandro Amenabar - is the appropriate wake up call to the audience after two hours of real/dream world transcendence. What was Cameron Crowe thinking when he inserted a 5-minute - or was it 15 - monologue at the end of a 2-hour terror trip? There might be more satisfying ways to clarify the plot but this sure must be the easiest.<br/><br/>Unless you are a fan of Cruise or Cruz you may have a hard time sympathizing with their characters. Personally I have Cruise Control and sympathize with supporting characters like Brian Shelby (Jason Lee), David's best friend who (might) get trampled by David's dating games. Or was that David's dream world?  And at that point, who cares?<br/><br/>Is there a moral to this tale? I'm having the same trouble ending this review as Crowe had with ending his film.  Vanillasky?

You will need all four  the latter critical to talk through your impressions and the film's possibilities over a nice café mocha after the show.  <br/><br/>It's not another date movie of the kind Hollywood routinely churns out. There's a lot to like about this movie.  It demands to be watched ""Closely!"" Open your eyes . . .  (where'd I here that?)   Now there's nothing wrong with shallow fare like say 'Something about Mary' and 'Shallow Hal'.  To all flicks, a purpose.  Those are frolicks.

This one simply demands your full attention to Get It.  <br/><br/>The only hokey thing about the movie is the Cameron-Cameron / Cruise-Cruz thing.  That aside, it blazes bravely into Kubrickian surrealistic territory, a risky departure from the entertaining, mainstream achievements of Mr. Crowe to date . . . Virtually anything he slaps up on the screen will attract an audience by reputation and prior achievements.  Know that this one is a journey worth taking, if you bring at least 3 of the 4 elements first noted above.  <br/><br/>Criticism: It could easily have been clipped 20 minutes and retain every bit of its storyline, character development and film personality.  I suppose with three blockbuster successes decorating his resume, Cameron (Crowe) likely earned his editorial license.  Length mattered.

","Contains Spoilers David Aames (Tom Cruise) is a Casanova-about-town: a young, rich, handsome, and fashionable New Yorker who inherits the lucrative family business at a tender age--although his wealth could be snatched from him if he loses his ability to function rationally. Few boundaries seem to limit his lust for life, wine, women, and song (especially women). David's future seems etched in purest gold, just as his heart and sentiments appear to be fabricated of the cheapest plastic.<br/><br/>Everything goes wrong when Julie (Cameron Diaz), AKA his ""love-making buddy"" (er, that's an elegant facsimile of the cruder term used in the script) decides to take exception to his recently-acquired affection for Sofia (Penélope Cruz).  In particular, Julie feels compelled to drive like a maniac, eventually smashing her car into a stone wall.  Unfortunately our hero David's in the passenger's seat.  Result: she's dead, and he has to bear dreadfully disfiguring physical and emotional scars for the rest of his life.<br/><br/>When David first meets Sophia, this appears as if it might turn into an odd version of a ""10"" knockoff (with Cruz as Bo Derek). After the car accident, we have the sense that David will somehow transform himself, now that he's not so stunningly handsome anymore: as if Dorian Gray could somehow experience an afterlife as Mother Teresa.<br/><br/>But Dorian Gray was genuinely evil: David's just a spoiled rich playboy-cad. Nevertheless, the script tantalizingly teases our hopes that perhaps this is a story about true love and redemption. But things soon go from bad to worse, as we realize that much of the movie is told from in retrospective from his view--while incarcerated for murder (the supposed victim turns out to be Cruz, not Diaz).<br/><br/>After that, things begin to go haywire to an even greater extent. Tom Cruise's character goes to a restaurant and _wills_ the patrons to stop talking.  He makes love to Cruz and sees Diaz after he climaxes.  Other events occur that make the viewer feel utterly bereft of the capability to discriminate between reality and imagination.  By this time (about halfway through the 2-1/2 hour film), we've long since noticed that protagonist himself has lost that ability.  But, why?  Is his apparent madness the result of a plot to disinherit him?<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the subject of ""Vanilla Sky"" isn't crime or intrigue.  Nor is it an uplifting story about true love, loss and redemption, and/or self-discovery.  For one thing. at most Cruz (Sophia) and possibly David's superfluous side-kick (Brian, played flawlessly by Jason Lee) appear to either possess--or acquire--even the tiniest hint of genuinely interesting character development.<br/><br/>And whatever ""arty"" feel that Cameron Crowe (director and script writer) may have desired turns out to be utterly dispelled by a disappointingly thin and uninteresting plot.  The only thing that holds your attention is the question of how the provided clues could actually produce a plausible result (actually the depicted events are barely believable to all but the hardest-core sci-fi fans).<br/><br/>When the ending is revealed, you walk away disappointed--as if you'd gone to a fancy restaurant boasting elegant decor, servers with French accents, and no prices on the menu ... only to find a high-end version of a Big Mac shamelessly dripping grease all over the edge of your Bone China plate, onto the fancy linen tablecloth below.<br/><br/>Yes, the acting is excellent.  The music is compelling. The cinematography is wonderful.  Even the script has more than its share of witty moments. (Although this reviewer believes that Cruise should've been yelling ""Get me rewrite!"" instead of ""Tech support!"" at one key moment towards the film's end.)<br/><br/>This film may be worth seeing if you like the actors, and you don't allow yourself to be taken in by the expectations that it raises and mercilessly dashes.  Vanilla dreams--even when lifted heavenward--are doomed to be first-class bores.  And if there was ever a guilded dandelion, this flick is it."

","This is by far one of the most amazing films that I have ever seen.  Rarely does a movie take you through such a variety of emotions.  This is by no means your typical, run-of-the-mill, mainstream Hollywood movie, like you might be expecting.  At first glance the typical movie-goer may notice that this film is from the director of ""Jerry Maguire,"" and also stars Tom Cruise.  But this is no sappy love story about a sports agent, this is so much more.  From the advertisements, one can pick up that this film is an erotic thriller, which it is for the first 2/3rds, then it suddenly shifts gears and becomes something much more powerful.  To tell anymore would detract from the overall experience of this film.  The problem with most audience members is that they are not expecting this sudden shift away from the mainstream, and they do not keep an open mind about them.  Admittedly this is not a movie for everyone, in fact most of the people in the theater with me hated it.  I heard comments like, ""I don't get it,"" and ""After Mission Impossible 2, I expected something good out of Tom Cruise.""  If you are only open to mindless action like ""Mission Impossible 2,"" or sappy Oscar friendly stories like ""Jerry Maguire,"" then ""Vanilla Sky"" is not for you. However if you are looking for something a little different, then this movie comes highly recommended.  This is a movie that left me with a ""buzz"" afterwards.  It is a film for people who are dreamers, for people who like music and pop culture, for people who enjoy a smart film, and for people who are only secretly optimistic about life (in-the-closet optimists).  The film making is so straight-forward, which is the genius of Cameron Crowe.  From his first feature, ""Say Anything..."" this is obvious.  He is straight-forward and has the ability to create characters that are endearing to us.  Not to mention, he can incorporate music into his films like no one else (his semi auto-biographical film, ""Almost Famous"" gives us a good idea why)is a wonderful example of this.  ""Vanilla Sky"" is no exception, the sounds tell the story just as strongly as the images.  When R.E.M.'s ""Sweetness Follows"" came on I became so wrapped up in the movie that I almost forgot that I was in a theater with a couple making out beside of me. The soundtrack is like Cameron Crowe picked CD's from my collection. With artists like R.E.M., U2, Radiohead, The Beach Boys, and Bob Dylan you can't go wrong.  So in conclusion, go see ""Vanilla Sky"" with an open mind, and be prepared to be amazed."
"torrboy","7","0","0","19 December 2001"," Fairly good film that is let down by the last half hour.
","""Vanilla Sky"" could have been a great film, but the unnecessary and overly long ending softens the impact and leaves one feeling somewhat disappointed. The first two thirds of the film are very well done, with some excellent shots (eg, the deserted New York city streets), and the viewer is left guessing at every turn: is this a dream, or is this reality? Is this the past, the present, or the future? Was it a setup, or did he really do it? The movie is enthralling and there are many details to keep the viewer's mind focused on the unraveling story, although by the end of the film you realise none of them really mattered.<br/><br/>At the ""end"" of the film, all the pieces fall into place as the main character (and hopefully the audience) realises what's been going on, and had the film ended at this point, it would have been one of those chilling endings like ""The Sixth Sense."" The viewer has enough information to make sense of the film, but nothing is really explained in detail; viewers could have a wonderful time exploring the many possible explanations of the film. (For those who have seen the film, this is the scene where Tom spots the television commercial and starts banging on the glass in the cell).<br/><br/>Unfortunately, once Tom has figured it all out, the audience is subjected to a long, drawn-out explanation of what has happened (just in case they hadn't figured it out yet), and the film explains everything in agonising detail, which destroys all the fun! No longer can you ponder whether such-and-such a scene was real or a dream, because it's all laid out in black and white. Ending the movie on an optimistic note also seemed against the grain of the film; it's been dark all the way through, so why change directions now?<br/><br/>Others have compared this movie to Mulholland Drive, which I feel is a much better movie, despite (and because of) the fact that it is totally incomprehensible to me. It seems like ""Vanilla Sky"" is trying hard to be an artsy, intellectual movie, yet at the same time it tries to cater to the ""big dumb action movie"" crowds. This backfires as the ""artsy"" crowd will feel patronised whilst the ""popcorn movie"" fans won't be seeing this film anyway.<br/><br/>All in all, an interesting film that is worth seeing for the first two thirds, but you can definitely wait for the video / DVD release."

","This is one of those movies that I wanted to like it more then I did.  Yet, I can't help but be disappointed.<br/><br/>Let me start by saying that I don't understand anyone who praises Tom Cruise's performance.  Though there have been instances where Tom Cruise has occasional done well in a film, for the most part, he is an inconsistant actor who comes up short more often then not.  If he was considered so cute by the ladies in his youth, he would never be making movies today. Throughout this film, I laughed at the choices he made as an actor.  His character has this unconvincing, self-deprecating laugh that annoyed me because it sounded so contrived.  And when in doubt as to how to act in a scene, he seemed to default to this unconvincing smile.  Furthermore, I can't buy into the entire relationship between he and Penelope Cruz because it stretches credibility that she saw any charm in him.  (between all of the other fantastic things that happen which I CAN accept, that women were supposed to be seduced by him, is too far too stretch.  And I understand that he was supposed to be a rich, self-obsessed womanizer - but most womanizer's have a charming side that seduces their 'victims.'  I think the only reason we're supposed to believe that he was a womanizer is because they (1) its Tom Cruise and (2) the script says so.)  I saw the movie with a number of other people and not one person commented positively on his performance.<br/><br/>The saving grace of the film is the idea of the movie.  (Which I won't go into detail and spoil it)  A friend of mine who saw it thought the movie was 'the biggest piece of trash put out this year' until the ending.  He thought it saved the movie.  But, any movie that bores and annoys an audience until the finale, isn't put together properly.  I think the movie would have been better served if more clues had been given to the audience for them to mull over until the ending.  (Though its possible on a second viewing, there may be more clues there, I can't imagine having the patience to sit through it again.)<br/><br/>**Possible Spoiler Clue**  And though we both enjoyed the idea of the film, it was far from original having been done in other movies, most obviously, Total Recall.<br/><br/>My biggest regret is not seeing the original, ""Abre Los Ojos"" first.  I'm not sure now whether to see it.<br/><br/>I can see where the movie has potential for disagreement.  I only recommend that anyone who wants to see the film, save your $9 and rent it on video with a bunch of friends."

","Vanilla Sky really had a shot at being interesting.  What went so wrong; the last half-hour or so.  Many comments have said this is `not for the easily entertained.'  Which is funny because the last couple film roles starring Cameron Diaz or Tom Cruise, or had direction by Cameron Crowe was quite simply that, easy entertainment.   Tom Cruise was at his `peak' in his most common role, big shot, and successful stud that all the chicks want.  He has a fall from grace, some shabby depression, and a re-awakening by the end of the movie.  Penelope Cruz and Cameron Diaz stole the show but with nearly identical performances of witty cute girls. Of course until Cameron Diaz drives a car off a bridge in a jealous rage.  This would be the Vanilla Sky's first `twist.'  Not really that enthralling.  What happens next is a dry build up of a love story that starts to go somewhere till the next twist.  This next twist really opens up the movie to many possibilities, realistic possibilities.  Things start to go haywire, and it gets confusing but still is interesting.  By the final twist I was saying out loud `what the' What could really have been something got slammed fast by that really annoying guy with the big eyes.  If there is one thing I hate about movies, it is those characters that come out of nowhere and have all the answers. In Vanilla Sky's climax, the film has strayed far away from psychological drama and turned into science-fiction boo-ha.  Flashbacks to what really happened are visited to help the audience figure it out, if this wasn't easy entertainment then the flashbacks would be completely unnecessary, because an audience not subdued by easy entertainment could have figured it out. Vanilla Sky was basically a huge waste of time.  Better luck next time for Tom Cruise in his next typecast role."

","If Cameron Crowe had written this as an original screenplay, one could at least credit him with attempting a unique and personal vision.  Knowing that the script is based on a previous film, one is left with little justification for its frustrating and ultimately pretentious muddle.  The actors are all good -- Cruise unusually so -- but what are they doing in this long, complicated movie that actually becomes less interesting as it goes along?  The entire, endless last forty minutes is spent explaining the rest of it, but in a way that's neither interesting nor satisfying.  There are flashes of a much more compelling, daring, and provocative movie on occasion, but they go nowhere.  One leaves the theater feeling disturbed, but for no gain."

","Open your eyes...<br/><br/>That's the opening line.  I think too many people were thinking about how the original version was called 'Open Your Eyes' instead of actually listening to that line.  Simply put, if you watch this movie and you pay the slightest bit of attention, you will not be lost.  The film's third act wraps everything up in a neat little package that even fans of Adam Sandler movies can understand.<br/><br/>So, given all of that, was the film any good?  Yes.<br/><br/>I normally hate movies where the preview begins with, "" [insert male name] had the perfect life...until one day...""  but this one was very good.  The first act of the film does set it up to be one of those movies where some stupid crisis comes up that turns this self-absorbed man's life around, but it ended up being so much more.<br/><br/>I am really surprised that Cameron Crowe did so well directing this type of film.  Let's face it, from Say Anything to Almost Famous, his films have never tread on the same ground as this one.  And Jason Lee was great, as always.  His role was one that could have been lost in the whole rush of the film if he hadn't played it so enthusiastically.<br/><br/>Vanilla Sky reminded me of Mulholland Drive surprisingly enough.  Both take you on a trip that seems to defy explanation.  However, Mulholland Drive is clearly the superior film (as it does not require a quick summation complete with flashbacks and visual aids), but Vanilla Sky is definitely a film worth watching...and watching again.<br/><br/>The only potential problem with this film is the backlash it might incur. The general movie-going public (who made 'The Grinch' the top grossing movie last year) is probably still mad at Tom Cruise for making them ""suffer"" through Magnolia.  I don't mean to come off as one of those people who try to sound superior because of their movie taste, but I don't think most people will like this film.<br/><br/>""Tom Cruise had the perfect career...until one day..."""

","1 out of 4<br/><br/>Audiences in search of a mind trip filled with mystery and suspense  need to see something else.  Vanilla Sky takes you on a mind trip all right, but its ever-changing narrative and uniquely mysterious characters are only contrived elements in a story that lacks focus.  After two hours of questions, the premise of the entire film is summed up in ten minutes of flashbacks and explanation physically ripping the wind out of any hope you may have had for it.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise plays David Ames a millionaire magazine publisher with the world at his feet.  Beautiful women want him and success has never come easier. Julie Gianni (Cameron Diaz) is one of those women but is unwilling to share him with his new love interest, Sofia Serrano (Penelope Cruz).  Julie causes an accident that leaves David with a mutilated face and ever-present migraines.  His world is falling apart around him and nobody has the answers.<br/><br/>Cameron Crowe is generally a brilliant director.  Say Anything, Jerry Maguire and Almost Famous are great rides into the lives of their lead characters what makes them laugh and what makes them cry.  That sense of direction is evident in Vanilla Sky but too little emphasis is placed on the relationships.  Instead Crowe focuses on a mystery about murder and betrayal reaching outside of his comfort zone and failing.<br/><br/>Some of the performances are good but too many are awful.  Cameron Diaz stretches well in a `Fatal Attraction' evil that transcends her `girl next door' persona and Jason Lee shines as David's best friend and confidant with a quick wit and irascible charm.  Cruise gives us nothing new with his rich kid who can't seem to control his life character and the other Cruz is just downright unwatchable as an unintelligent waif riding on the coattails of everyone she meets.<br/><br/>If you're dragged kicking and screaming to this film you had better be prepared to sit through hours of strange and unengaging drama only to find that the wait was never worth it."

I keep thinking that the movie wasn't going to be long enough to clean up the mess and finally give the audience the final pieces of the puzzle.  It turns out the film didn't need to be any longer, it just needed to be over with because it wasn't going anywhere.<br/><br/>Even a highbrow movie needs to make sense when it's all said and done.

","Though I'm a huge fan of Cameron Crowe's and have generally respected what he's done in the past, I'm really torn on this one. On one hand, if you're a film fan -- and love Goddard and experimental film -- there's stuff here that you'll probably ""get"". Most of the acting here is really good, and I have to respect Crowe for taking risks, for trying to graft his populist, Frank Capra-style of filmmaking with a style that's much more post-modern. I appreciate Crowe tried to make an ambitious, challenging film that takes its cues from foreign cinema over Hollywood and I have to laud him for that.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the film has the same problem as ""A.I."": a really lousy final act. I won't have been put off by the red herrings, visceral theatrics and plot sucker punches if it actually lead up to something a la ""The Others"" (which was a film made by the same guy who did ""Open Your Eyes"" -- the Spanish flick this movie is based off of). Alas, it doesn't.<br/><br/>(Mild spoiler ahead.)<br/><br/>What starts out as a nice thriller-drama gradually descends into SF territory, and it just lost me. Instead of going ""Wow!"", my reaction was one of ""Huh?"" And I consider myself to be a smart guy who's well versed in film theory, and can follow some pretty complicated plots. It's as though Crowe had a lot of things he wanted to say with this movie about technology, relationships, commitment, faith in God and living life to the fullest, but just couldn't pull everything together into any sort of coherancy.<br/><br/>I will say though that Vanilla Sky has me clamouring to see Open Your Eyes, simply because I'm curious to see how much of the plot was changed for American audiences. And I'd have to say Vanilla Sky certainly has me thinking, even if it's about what the hell the movie was all about. Crowe has fashioned an interesting experiment, but viewing it is akin to watching a scientist trying to graft a dog and a cat together. It may be fascinating to see, but why it's being done beats the hell out of me.<br/><br/>For that, I guess Vanilla Sky is ""all frosting and no cake"". If only Crowe had thought a bit more about how his was mixing all of his ingredients together before throwing the concoction into the oven, he might have had a masterpiece."

","For a movie that purports to turn a microscope on our obsession with aesthetic beauty, our perpetual consumption patterns and our unyielding fascination with pop culture, Vanilla Sky is a maddeningly shallow film. One that, ironically (in the absence of any abiding insight) succeeds only insofar as it leaves behind a trail of beautiful imagery, discarded ideas and Crowe's hipper-than-thou pop-referential aura for us to gnaw on. Like pop culture - which deals primarily in beauty, hollow ideals and varying degrees of hip, Vanilla Sky is a crushingly empty proposition.<br/><br/>It does start promisingly, though. Within the first hour, Crowe plants the seeds for a variety of tantalizing ideas. It's all enough for one to reasonably expect that we're in for a learned, erudite meditation on the tricks of mass media, our reliance on superficiality, the cause for our unhappiness in the face of such shiny, happy billboards.<br/><br/>What we get instead is a cutesy love story that ultimately becomes bogged down by the film's cumbersome finish. Given the subject matter, you'd expect the answer to the film's most prevalent question (is Cruise's character being set up? is he insane? is he dreaming?) to have some sort of overarching meaning. It does not.<br/><br/>On the contrary, Crowe's final message is a dreadfully insipid one. Combined with its delivery (in a tidy package whereby every one of the film's questions is dismissed and explained away in frustratingly broad strokes), you're left feeling cheated, manipulated, disengaged.<br/><br/>So then; all style, no substance.

One day he experiences a life-changing moment that knocks him down a notch and he sinks into self-pity.

I'm not sure how much Crowe's plot deviates from the foreign language original, but this is a truly disappointing effort from one of the industry's better writer/directors.

","Cameron Crowe's latest film was my most eagerly anticipated release of the holiday season, so I went into the theatre on Saturday expecting big things. Was I satisfied? Sort of..kind of...maybe...<br/><br/>Good Things: The acting is superb all-around. In fact, this might be the best performance of Cruise's career; he's developed an amazing amount of maturity as an actor since the heartthrob days of ""Risky Business"". ""Vanilla Sky"" also proves that ""Eyes Wide Shut"" wasn't a fluke; Cruise has a dark side that he's willing to explore on film. Cruz and Diaz are both excellent (the chemistry between Cruise and Cruz is fantastic, their relationship is very believable). Even somewhat under-used actors like Jason Lee, Kurt Russell and Noah Taylor play their parts very well. This is a Cameron Crowe film, so obviously the soundtrack is perfect. Also, this was one of the most beautifully photographed films I can recall seeing, considering it takes place in an urban environment. Cinematographer John Toll has had success in the past working with landscapes in ""Legends of the Fall"" and ""Braveheart"", but his eye is perfectly suited for New York City. There's a shot of an empty Times Square that's nothing short of breathtaking.<br/><br/>
Enough superlatives, time for the bad stuff.<br/><br/>*SPOILERS*<br/><br/>It seems that goal of Crowe and Co. in making ""Vanilla Sky"" was to create a surrealist journey of self-discovery. If that was the case, they came up short. First, the surrealism. ""Vanilla Sky"" has lots of juicy twists and turns, which lead you to believe that it's going somewhere interesting, and it does, only to pull itself back from the brink of true surrealism. ""Mulholland Drive"" is the best movie of the year, and it too explores the nature of dreams vs. reality in a surrealist setting, but unlike Crowe, David Lynch is absolutely unapologetic about his film's weirdness. Everything in ""Vanilla Sky"" is explained in the last 10 minutes by ""tech support"", one of the laziest narrative conventions I've ever seen. Everything, right down to the title of the film. Some might claim that this isn't your typical Hollywood movie, but I beg to differ. Only in Hollywood are audiences assumed to be so dumb that they can't figure out ANYTHING on their own. Not only is everything explained, the ending makes half the movie irrelevent. Twists and turns that seemed so interesting are rendered meaningless.<br/><br/>Second, there's the self discovery. Cruise's character, David, is as shallow as they come, and early in the film, Jason Lee's character says something about ""experiencing the bitter to appreciate the sweet."" Nice foreshadowing. Surely David will lose everything, but come to appreciate certain things as a result, right? Well he loses everything, but when the time comes for his ultimate decision, David's choice doesn't show any growth at all. He must choose between living in a dream world where everything is perfect, or living in reality. Except in reality, they have the technology to fix his mangled face! If his damaged face represents his loss, what is he giving up by choosing reality!?<br/><br/>*END SPOILERS*<br/><br/>""Vanilla Sky"" is a nice change of pace for Crowe, but can't compare to his earlier romantic/comedic/dramatic character studies like ""Say Anything"" and ""Jerry Maguire"". This film is a tentative first step into a darker side of filmmaking for the director, and it shows a lot of promise. Maybe he didn't get it right this time, but in a little while we'll surely see Cameron Crowe's brooding masterpiece."

In fact I spoke nothing to my wife until we were out of the theater, and then my first words were `people who take acid should not make movies' , `there should be a law against it somewhere!'. Does anyone remember Funny Farm with Chevy Chase and Madolyn Smith-Osborne? In the movie she reviews his horrible script.

","This could have been a great movie, or at least a very good movie. Instead it ends up being merely an interesting so-so flick. Basic plot - David Aames (Tom Cruise) is a playboy millionaire living the good life, sleeping with his friend Julianna (Cameron Diaz) and playing tennis with his buddy Brian (Jason Lee). At a party he snubs Julianna and falls in love with Sofia (Penelope Cruz). Julianna exacts revenge by running her car off a bridge with herself and David inside, killing herself and disfiguring David. Weirdness ensues.<br/><br/>The movie tries to be a psychological thriller/drama, but moves way to slow. It loses its way distracted by scenes that don't advance the mystery, tension or plot. At around 150 minutes, the movie runs close to 30 minutes too long. Tightening up the movie would have done wonders for it, really.<br/><br/>The second major problem is the music - I've no idea what Crowe was thinking here. The music at parts is too loud and actually distracts from some of the more pivotal scenes in the movie.<br/><br/>The ending of the movie also left me feeling rather cheated. With a mystery like Mulholland Drive all the pieces start to come together and you see it all fall into place. Vanilla Sky is reduced to having one of the characters go into a ten minute speech explaining the entire 140 minutes that came before. Ugh.<br/><br/>In closing - a simple re-editing could improve the quality of the movie by a lot, removing the annoying soundtrack during certain scenes would help a little. Maybe we can hope for a new cut of the film when it hits DVD."

","Stanley Kubrick worked with Tom Cruise for over two years, to produce the highly anticipated, visually stunning failure, 'Eyes Wide Shut'. Cruise should still have stretch marks from that fiasco. Tom Cruise seems to be a very sincere, and extremely hard-working actor, unfortunately, he must have believed Cameron Crowe could actually make a more superior psychological thriller than Kubrick; which seems kind of silly. 'Vanilla Sky' is an glossy, manipulative, and ultimately insulting attempt to convince viewers, they are actually watching a very cerebral psycho-erotic work of art. Tom Cruise is once again, out of his element, especially during the painfully absurd psycho-cinema portions of this film. Kubrick's 'Eyes Wide Shut' was a visually stylish and beguiling film, which made the Tom Cruise character seem more out of place. 'Vanilla Sky' is a handsome film; but the director's sloppy and manipulative antics are so ridiculous, that Tom Cruise looks pretty good in comparison. The other performances were competent, and I agree with those who feel Penelope Cruz was better in the original film.

A very elaborate movie is brilliantly constructed from a very simple premise. Man has party, meets girl, goes to her house, falls asleep watching commercial, has elaborate dream that mixes vanity with guilt, attraction with self doubt, and of course, as what happens with many of us when we fall asleep, mixes it all with the last thing he was thinking about - in this case an infomercial about cryogenics.

","Writer/Director Cameron Crowe, who gave us such touching films as ""Jerry Maguire"", ""Say Anything"", and ""Almost Famous"" uses his craft at making a brilliant love story and successfully combines it with a psychological thriller in ""Vanilla Sky"".  I just saw this film yesterday, and I am still effected by its twists and turns.  Crowe's direction constantly kept my attention and always had me guessing about what was going to happen next. My only complaint about the film is the ending, which dragged about 20 minutes too long and basically walked the viewer through the previous two hours of the film.  Too much was explained and that took away from the surprise ending.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise was also exceptional in the film.  He takes the hopelessness he had as a Vietnam vet in ""Born on the Fourth of July"", combines it with his paranoid character in ""The Firm"", and the smoothness of Maverick in ""Top Gun"", and creates an awesome dynamic character.

","A disturbing masterpiece showing finest work by Cameron Crowe, Tom Cruise, and the editor.  Use of music and sound editing is ground-breaking and fascinating. First half of story is straight-line narrative- cocky rich guy, on top of his world, gets into accident.  Second half of film shows what it is like to have a mind that is broken by alcohol, drugs, paranoia, head damage, fear and situational psychosis. The movie lets you experience what this is like to have a riven mind, rather than letting you observe it from the outside.  Sure, it is a little confusing and sometimes you do not understand just who is who and what is going on- just like the guy in the movie is experiencing. Just an absolute smash-up work of genius!  Sound editor deserves an Emmy. Real sexual chemistry between Cruise and Cruz, too.  And Cameron Diaz as an evildoer is great- I did not know she was such an actress!  Tom Cruise is in top form here. Do not go expecting this to be a romantic comedy or something.  This is a haunting, highly disturbing film that should probably not be viewed by those in any state of mental disturbance.

Lots of energy, but any character development takes place behind the latex where we can't see it. Cameron Diaz does the best work - her huge smirk is quite scary. Penelope Cruz, the Good Woman, is perky rather than manic, sweet but not demanding, and not at all threatening (yawn). The cinematography is flashy and fun.

Is it an artist's rendition of an impossibly handsome and rich protagonist (Cruise) who dances through life with impossibly beautiful and charming girlfriends (Cruz and Diaz) beneath a vanilla sky? Is it a mosaic of idealized 20th-century Americana coupled with an eerily-effective musical score?  Is it perhaps a morality lesson, reminding us that beauty is only skin-deep and that indeed in a charmed life, one might not recognize true happiness?<br/><br/>It's all of these and more.

On the plus side, the main ideas about how people treat each other, the degree of control we have over our own destiny, regret and how love can last forever were great.  The makeup was realistic and after a while you start to ignore the Tom Cruise's injuries just like if you knew someone personally who had been in a car accident.

I really liked the premise of LE, but I think the movie should have ended with Tom Cruise in the cell seeing the add on television and figuring the whole thing out.  Everything else after that seemed like it was tacked on just in case the viewer didn't catch it to start with and served no real purpose.  It was just like the last bit of AI.

First off, they doubled (minimum) the clues throughout the film to give away the ending.  I am fairly certain that if I had never seen the original, I still would have known the ending long before it arrived.  Cameron Crowe apparently feels that the American public is incapable of following a non-formula film, and has hence assimilated it to the formulaic expectations of his target audience as much as possible.  I felt that the audience was having their hand held through the entire experience, and the cryptic original had been dulled down to a cheesy Hollywood movie.

","I don't know where Cameron Crowe found the nerve to put in the credits ""Written for the screen and directed by Cameron Crowe"" - I mean, ALL he did was translating straight from Spanish the original ! And the truth is, some rewriting - maybe even a lot - or at least a slightly more adventurous adaptation might have served the movie well. True, the whole crippled act by Tom Cruise is quite surprisingly convincing and probably better than in the original, but it doesn't make up for the (unchanged) ridiculous ending - not as convoluted as it's cracked up to be, it just looks like a cheap trick from a scriptwriter who couldn't decide how to tie up the story's loose ends. (By the way, the love story, supposedly central here, is not well served by a total lack of ""onscreen chemistry"" between the Cruizes.) 	So if you want to see a really witty script toss around ""LoveHateDreamsLifeWorkPlayFriendshipSex"", you're better off with David Fincher's The Game which, when you think about it, has a lot in common with this movie - except that it opposes, to a relatively bland story with a far-fetched, sci-fi-like ending, a mind-blowing story with a remarkably sober ending.

","There are spoilers here.  Be forewarned.<br/><br/>Between ""Waking Life,"" ""Mulholland Drive,"" and this one, ""Vanilla Sky,""  I'm wondering when the hell *I'm* gonna wake up.  Dreams have had a rebirth in the medium of motion pictures, and why not?  They're fertile ground for material and give the director a much more broad visual landscape.  Remember when studios had animated bugs, haunted houses and comets battling each other at the box office?  And they say the movie industry's gone down the toilet.<br/><br/>""Vanilla Sky"" is a remake of the 1997 Spanish film called ""Abre Los Ojos."" That film was directed by Alejandro Amenabar.  While I admire Amenabar's work, (He went on to direct ""The Others."") his source material doesn't hold a candle to the remake by vastly underrated writer-director Cameron Crowe. Crowe has done two personal and character driven masterpieces (""Say Anything..."" and ""Almost Famous."") and I must admit that I had some hesitancy to see the advanced screening that I saw this evening.  Crowe's forte is small, personal films, and the previews would have us believe that this is some super-charged erotic thriller designed purely to earn untold millions.  But in reality, ""Vanilla Sky"" is anything but.  What I love about Crowe's films is that his characters always have the right things to say. Not so much in the dialogue sense, but in the fact that one line an actor can deliver can give a very real sense of a feeling or an emotion.<br/><br/>And the cast Crowe has wrangled to deliver these lines is top notch. Penelope Cruz gives off great vulnerability that would not be normally seen when her sex kitten image is taken into account.  Cameron Diaz is very good at using her face to reveal dark undertones through a sunny demeanor.  Jason Lee has a believability that could convince one that he could walk off the screen and talk to you.  But the really impressive performance is by Tom Cruise, who plays a millionaire womanizer who is horribly disfigured after a car accident.  He hits his notes of bitterness very well, considering that he's Tom Cruise and has precious damn little to be bitter about.<br/><br/>""Vanilla Sky"" is so full of secrets that I've probably given a few away already with out having meant to.  Sorry about that. But this movie is about the domain of dreams, and the only problem I have with ""Vanilla Sky"" is at the end, everything is explained.  This is not bad in and of itself, but ""Mulholland Drive,"" David Lynch's far superior film, deliberately didn't explain anything.  That left the viewer with an urge to make up an explanation and become an armchair Freud.  This leaves you with nothing to say but ""Wow.  That was a good movie.""<br/><br/>***1/2 out of 4"

No, I have never really seen that brilliance others see in Crowe. I never found his writing to be interesting or stimulating. Moreover, his films all tend to be sappy and desperate for commercial appeal. Quite frankly, he bores me. But, getting back to Vanilla Sky. This was a lousy film that tried to hide sloppy direction and a poor script by throwing in countless Peter Gabriel and Beach Boy songs. For awhile, I thought I was watching MTV in the 1980s.

Whilst Tom has been in some very good films I feel that the films would have been a lot better if someone else was starring. Tom has got to be one of the luckiest actors around because some of the parts he has been given could fool anybody into believing he could actual act. You can always measure an actors ability in a film when the are co-staring with undoubtedly good actors. For example 'Interview with a vampire' showed me that whilst Brad Pitt could act Tom Cruise couldn't.

"veovisjohn","1","4","12","27 January 2002"," A Complete Butchery of Abre Los Ojos
","The absolute most annoying thing about this film is that some people think it is so `original.'  The entire film is a re-make of a highly superior film from Spain called Abre Los Ojos.  As a matter of fact, re-make is too nice a word.  I would say it is a shameless destruction of another person's ideas. This person is Alejandro Amenábar, the Spanish director who recently made The Others.  The film Abre Los Ojos was made only a few years ago, hardly warranting a re-make.  Abre Los Ojos is original, entertaining and well made, with far less of a budget than Vanilla Sky.<br/><br/>Now Cameron Crowe has taken this excellent film and literally destroyed everything great about.  The plot is needlessly lengthened to the point of absurdity.  Tom Cruse shows off his usual inability to deliver any sort of quality whatsoever (the only time I've ever seen him do anything worth watching was in Magnolia).  The ending is given a ridiculous happy spin and is dragged out.  The only person remotely worth watching in this film is Jason Lee, who actually does his part justice beyond the actor in the original.<br/><br/>In the past, when Cameron Crowe has worked with material of his own, the results have not been too bad.  However, as Crowe attempts to show, or should I say steal another persons story, he fails miserably.  The film is injected with pop songs and references.  Okay I get it Crowe.  So, if you put a bunch of songs that people like, you think some of that quality will rub off onto your film?  Keep dreaming.  The songs are placed horribly and have almost nothing to do with what occurs.  It is not like in Rushmore, where the songs seem to match the mood of the scene.  In Vanilla Sky, the Beach Boy's `Good Vibrations' blasts through the speakers while Tom Cruse runs around all confused.  Oh yeah, Beach Boys.  That's exactly what I think of when I'm having a nervous breakdown.<br/><br/>Trying to re-create Abre Los Ojos the way Cameron Crowe does is like attempting to draw a beautiful work of art with an Etch-A-Sketch.  It looks terrible and probably should not be attempted in the first place.  The penalty for stealing in some countries is to have your hands cut off.  If this sentence were carried out with Cameron Crowe, he would be getting off lightly."
"beegee3079","1","4","12","14 January 2002"," If one more user implies that I just 'don't get' this movie...
","Let's get one thing straight here; this film was made for Tom Cruise's ego. They spent a lot of money on it, pulled in an acclaimed director, and even photocopied an English translation of a previously acclaimed film's script. It couldn't fail could it?<br/><br/>Well it did.  There are NO brilliant social observations in this movie, the whole life extension thing was NOT a vehicle for the people behind this film to display some sort of deeper meaning or commentary about society (it was just a failed plot device), and all it managed to do was lower Cruise and Crowe's standing in the eyes of many critics, both professional and amateur, all over the world.<br/><br/>Cruise has shown many times that he can act, for examples just see 'Born on the Fourth of July' or 'Magnolia' and Crowe can most certainly piece together a worthwhile film, i.e. 'Almost Famous,' but both should walk off with their tails between their legs after this one.<br/><br/>The 'suprise' ending, which some have even compared to the one in 'the Sixth Sense,' is just a ridiculous.  The ending in M. Night Shyamalan's film was signposted throughout the film and relied on clever camera work, scripting, and editing to hide the secret.  It was done in a clever fashion and all fitted in quite neatly. THIS film just added a completely contrived and stupid ending without giving any sort of hint as to what might happen earlier (unless you count the constant references to that snap frozen dog). You could put the exact same ending on a film about the life of Martin Luther King and it would fit just as well as it does in this one.<br/><br/>Now you may have noticed that it's the ending that I am complaining about in particular. In all honesty, the first hour or so of the film is an effective scene setter.  Yes, Cruise only shows one emotion before the accident and another vaguely modified one afterwards, but Cameron Diaz and Kurt Russell offer impressive performances and it often feels as though Vanilla Sky is just on the verge of blowing your mind and becoming film of the year. Then comes the ending.<br/><br/>Yes, a few good performances and a good first hour might seem to be justification for giving the film some credit (at least more than I'm about to give it) but that only adds insult to injury when the aforementioned STUPID second half kicks in.  Don't worry if you didn't like this film while others you know loved it and claim that any smart person would like it; you are right.  They have just been caught up in the pretentiousness that this film carries with it from start to finish. The fact the IMDB users have given this drivel such a high score just proves the phrase 'there's no accounting for taste.'<br/><br/>3/10 Tops.

I was also very disappointed by Tom Cruise on this one for two reasons: -First, for being a big Tom Cruise fan, I found that he just doesn't seem to fit at all for this role, it's not like any other movie he's made.

And the whole ""this is nothing but a dream"" ending has been done to death.  Hollywood can't even be original any more."

I have already said what I wanted to say, but to meet the requirements I will write the lines. I think a movie is a work of collective art, and thus a remake is a mere fake. This movie is therefore a faked ""Abre los Ojos"". You can watch it and you will enjoy it. But there is something false and wrong in it. I think that the U.S. film industry is so rich that it can afford to remake a whole film just to avoid dubbing the original or to spare the viewer the ordeal of reading subtitles. Maybe they just do it to make a profit out of it, without supplying the ideas, the creative part of art, i.e. by cheating. This is nevertheless, in my eyes, something quite monstrous.

","This was a thoroughly enjoying movie. I can understand how some people did not like this movie, probably the actors or that it is a real thinking movie with some twists that you have to pay attention to. This movie is a mix between a mystery, adventure and a romantic comedy and just a good all around story. The Tom Cruise character is a man that have everything anyone could ever want and more, he ends up loosing it and then gets a second chance with a catch. In the end facing all his demons and the full scope of all that is happening around him forces him to choose simplicity and reality. So that finally he can find the one thing he could never really get and thats happiness. As far as story lines go Tom basically inherits his dads company and has a 51% stake in the company. Since the board does not think he deserves the company he is constantly ad odds with them and himself living a meaningless life with a shallow Cameron Diaz. At his birthday party he meets Penelope Cruz who he instantly falls for. The morning after the part he ends up making a decision that will change his life forever and he soon finds out there is no going back. Tom Cruise does a fabulous job in this movie showing that he does have some range and seems that he has possibly been type-casted and should be given a more variety of roles after this. Penelope Cruz does a outstanding job playing the object of Toms affection. She brings a alluring innocence to the role that complements her character and makes her forthcoming and accessible, yet lacking any sense of mystery. Cameron Crowe knows how to get the best out of his actors and does a great job with Cruz. Cameron Diaz looks better then ever sizzles on screen. Make no mistake she delivers a complete package performance with her character. Her performance can be measured by having just a limited time on screen still leaves unforgettable performance. Half way through the movie really starts to question your sense of existence, but by the end all will be revealed. It is definitely wild, reality bending entertaining experience. That you will have to see to believe the unique experience this brings."

","This movie is an insult to the original version, Abre los Ojos. The original's title means open the eyes, but when you see this clumsy and wretched abomination, you'll want to close them again. Perhaps even gouge them out.<br/><br/>The Spanish movie boasted a fine cast, skillful direction, and exquisite cinematography in relating a beautiful, romantic, inspiring, and thought provoking tale that touches both the heart and mind. This rubbish copy fails to do any of this. All you see is Tom Cruise sauntering around with a bizarre blemish on his face, while reciting lines in an uninspired mono tonal manner that fails to convey the rich story. A movie that poses questions about reality and fantasy, among several other topics, requires (and deserves) more convincing acting. Penelope Cruz did a fine job in the original, yet looks like a broken marionette in this version. Cameron Diaz, doing her same old over-aged teen girl bit, is simply annoying.<br/><br/>A rare positive note here is Kurt Russell, not only for the one superior performance in this film, but for putting up with all these hacks and not just giving up as most people would be tempted to do. Also, I applaud whoever punched Tom in the face, marking him up like that: well done. These elements, and the few remnants of the original story that made it into this convoluted excursion to nowhere are the only reason this isn't a ""1.""<br/><br/>Avoid this dreadful mess, and see the original instead."

","Cameron Crowe and Tom Cruise have so much in common with David Aames that this movie is a first: a Bi-Biopic. Roger Ebert claimed the film requires heavy lifting from its audience which only confirms that his brain is fried. Faulkner this is not. Pop-friction it is.<br/><br/>Only time will tell if any of Crowe's films will become timeless. However, his constant reliance on pop music to deliver the emotional climaxes in key scenes (q.v. the Beach Boys ""Good Vibrations"") firmly roots his movies in the Now. As a result, I am convinced the only timelessness this movie possesses is yet another Baby Boomer's narcissistic exploration of the possibility of immortality.<br/><br/>Yet, are we really to believe that Aames, Crowe, or Cruise would actually pull the plug on themselves? According to Crowe, sure, if their lucid dream becomes anything less than a narcissistic fantasy.

","This is one of the most incredible movies I have ever seen, as It's absolutely mind blowing, with a mesmerizing story and stunning performances!. All the characters are amazing, and it will leave you thinking about it for a long time after you have finished watching it, believe me, plus Tom Cruise(especially), Cameron Diaz and Penélope Cruz are all simply incredible in this, and Kurt Russell is amazing!. I have not seen the original Open Your Eyes yet, but I found this film to be simply incredible ,and Tom Cruise delivers another dynamite performance, as he pulled off an incredibly difficult role with perfection, plus I found this film to be extremely creepy for some reason (but in a good way). Cameron Diaz also deserves tons of props with her incredible performance as she was also creepy, and The car crash scene is especially disturbing, plus the ending while confusing was absolutely brilliant as it blew me away!. It's brilliantly made and written, and all the characters are extremely likable, plus Cruise had outstanding chemistry with both Diaz and Cruz. <br/><br/>However if you don't pay strict attention you will get lost, as it is a very hard film to follow, and Cruise's smashed up face was extremely creepy but wonderfully done and realistic looking, as I don't know How Cruise managed to pull that off but he did,plus it's very, very complex as well. This movie will especially not be for everybody, as it really is one of a kind film, and is an acquired taste, plus the psychiatric scenes with Cruise and Russell were fantastic. I really loved the incredible angles Cameron Crowe did, and This film has plenty of disturbing and shocking moments as well, plus that mask Cruise had to wear was very chilling. Even at 136 minutes it was never overlong, and I would put this in Cruise's top 5 best performances, plus this should be way higher then 6.8 in my opinion. It's also a brilliant Sci-Fi film as well, and The opening dream Cruise had was really cool, and somewhat creepy, plus I loved the script as well. <br/><br/>I will be definitely checking out the original, since I loved this one, and dare I say this should be in the top 250?, plus I think it's quite cool that Penélope Cruz decided to play the same role twice as she played the same role in the original!. Everybody was just perfectly casted, and all the stars look just great, plus while I am a huge Cameron Diaz fan I wasn't sure if she could pull this off or not as it was quite a difficult role, boy did she ever prove me wrong. I don't know if anyone could have played his role as well as Cruise did,and as far as remakes go (even though I have yet to see the original) this is as good as it gets, plus Cameron Crowe proves here why he is considered one of the best directors out there!. I'm going to say anything more, because I want the viewers to go in without knowing anything. This is one of the most incredible films I have ever seen, as it's absolutely mind blowing, with a mesmerizing story, and stunning performances,and if you haven't seen it please do so immediately, every movie buff should watch it!. <br/><br/>The Direction is incredible!. Cameron Crowe does an incredible! job here with amazing camera work, outstanding angles, giving it a really dreamy like feel to it and keeping the film at and incredibly engrossing pace.<br/><br/>The Acting is simply stunning!. Tom Cruise is amazing as always and is incredible here, he had to play an incredibly difficult role and he did it with perfection he was also extremely likable, very charming, and you will feel for his character and what he is going through, he simply blew me away in a lot of scenes, especially when he is horribly disfigured just his walk, and his reactions it was amazing, he is especially incredible near the end,but fear not Cruise fans that smile will be seen often throughout the film, this is one his absolute best performances! (Cruise Rules!!!!!!!!!!). Penélope Cruz is also incredible here in her scenes as Sofia, she is incredibly gorgeous, very sweet and charming, had outstanding chemistry with Cruise, and was wonderfully energetic I loved her! (Cruz Rules!!). Cameron Diaz is amazing as always and is also incredible here, she is incredibly gorgeous, but also very creepy here, the famous suicide scene with her gave me the chills she was just so convincing, it really shocked me, she also plays the obsessive type extremely well too! (Diaz Rules!!!!!!!). Kurt Russell is amazing as always and is amazing here as the Doc, he is extremely likable intense, had some great scenes with Cruise, I just wished he had more screen time!. Jason Lee is awesome as Cruise's best friend he was funny and intense at the same time I really liked him. Rest of the cast are fine. <br/><br/>Overall if you haven't seen it please do so immediately every movie buff has to see it at least once. ***** out of 5"

The next day, he gets in a car accident while in the car with the Cameron Diaz character, and that is when the ingenious story begins.<br/><br/>The thing to admire the most about ""Vanilla Sky"" is Cameron Crowe's direction. His last film was last year's superb ""Almost Famous"", in which he proved he knows how to tell a good story. In this film, he uses a different style, mood, and genre. Crowe's direction, Cruise's excellent performance, breathtaking cinematography and an ingenious, original plot make ""Vanilla Sky"" one of the best films in years."

","I was staying up late on Sunday night and with nothing better on TV, I decided to start watching a foreign movie on The Movie Channel.

There was a little twist at the end, but much better and believable than Vanilla Sky.<br/><br/>I used to respect Cameron crow but after seeing a worse remake, makes me question is creativity.

"BusterB","5","2","5","14 January 2002"," Interesting premise... weak execution
","This film is at its heart a thriller. The question that nags at you from halfway through the movie is, ""What the heck is going on here?"" No, I didn't see the ending coming, so on that level it worked for me as a puzzlebox of a movie.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, in my books a thriller has to have four things going for it before it rates:<br/><br/>1. You can't see what's coming from a mile away. In this sense, Vanilla Sky was fine. I see that one or two people here had the ending pegged, but I sure didn't.<br/><br/>2. Once you know how things end up, you should be kicking yourself because you ""should have figured it out."" Again, Vanilla Sky delivers: there are enough clues throughout the film (over and over and over) that I should have clued in. However, the clues seem unconnected to the story, so I took the bait didn't make the connection. Two good marks for Vanilla Sky.<br/><br/>3. There should be a credible, interesting alternative explanation. Here I found the film a letdown. What's the alternative explanation? That he's going crackers? This didn't hold my interest long. As such, I found the film turned into a long series of weird events that I couldn't make sense of... until the end. Fun thrillers are fun when you think you have it figured out except for one or two nagging inconsistencies... and then you find out you've been led down the garden path. I spent a third of Vanilla Sky either not knowing what was going on or not caring, until I finally found out in the last ten minutes. Not very satisfying.<br/><br/>4. You have to care about what happens to the characters. I think that this is Vanilla Sky's biggest failing. I must say up front that I've never seen a Tom Cruise movie before. I know: hard to believe; where have I been? Regardless, I found it hard to get interested in his character, because I couldn't figure out what he was feeling throughout the beginning of the film. I took away the impression that he has only five facial expressions: toothy smile, pouty look, angry frown (pouty look without lip extended), ""that look"" he gives the women that makes them swoon, and quizzical frown. This last one appears much of the time throughout Vanilla Sky, and it simply wasn't enough for me to connect to the character. As such, I had trouble caring about what was happening to him near the end. Tom Cruise spends part of this movie wearing a mask, and oddly enough I found him a better actor with it on: he displays more emotion with his voice and his body movements than with his face.<br/><br/>Overall rating: Rent this one. There is nothing in it that requires the big screen and it isn't worth the big ticket entry price, unless you love Tom Cruise or, like my wife, you have vertigo and want to sit in the front row and have your stomach do flips during the New York flyover scenes."

","First of all let me say I'm a huge fan of Cameron Crowe (the film's screenwriter/director).  I loved Say Anything, Singles, Almost Famous, and even Jerry Maguire and Fast Times at Ridgemont High.  However, Vanilla Sky is so completely different from all of Crowe''s other movies that by the end it was just plain vanilla. My main complaints?  1) the script.  Bad dialogue, for one.  The script although not particularly stellar in the first half of the movie, waxed cheesy, sci-fi, and flat l towards the end, and elements of ""A.I."" and ""Memento"" (the latter of which I loved) took over in what many people, including me, were anticipating to be a much more traditional love story.  2) NO character development.  I particularly don't like new characters being introduced near the film's end, especially ones who offer a weak explanation of the movie's deep, profound, spiritual meaning.  Blech.  3) Length.  I frequently find exceptions to my personal rule that if a movie takes more than 2 hours to tell its story then it's way too long, but I was ready for this to be over about an hour before it ended. I did love certain scenes, including the beginning and ending sequences, the soundtrack was incredible, and certain shots make me want to go back and more closely examine the film.  for some movies, I would do this.  But I don't care about the characters at all, and found the movie to be grasping at straws seeking profundity, so at this point i don't care to waste my time and money again."

I liked most of them... but found this late arrival relentlessly contrived, pretentious, narcissistic, vacuous, tedious...<br/><br/>It would have been better if they'd just played it all out in front of a big mirror as home entertainment, with loads of breaks for self-congratulation. In fact, most of the time, looking at the screen was like staring cringefully at the hammy acting, lousy direction and terrible script through a two-way mirror. Why did all these sad characters have to rope in a cinema audience to convince themselves how hip and clever they were? I thought Tarantino was the ne plus ultra of pretentious narcissism. This runs him pretty close, without the art.<br/><br/>I guess you'd call this self-conscious tripe 'postmodern'. It's basically a very old genre - as old as the illusion of moving pictures themselves.

Cameron Diaz as Sophia was not done the way it was intended but I think it was a problem in direction not acting.

It really plays with your head. <br/><br/>Spoiler alert!!! read only if you have seen or don't plan to watch<br/><br/>I like the fact that as a viewer it challenges you to not judge David by his new disfigured face, why yesterday he was so charming and attractive the lines he said where so witty and now he seems so pathetic trying to impress Sofia with the same lines and you see Sofia feeling sorry for him and disgusted by his disfigurement and as a viewer you really hate yourself for feeling the same...so dose Sofia. now that is real strong stuff when we are given a mirror to how shallow we really are...how we judge looks...made me quite upset about myself. The movie is about the mind trying to make it alright again. To fix the shatrerd realty like in dreams..its gets out of control...poor David his character is so tragic i cried so much for him at the end...such a sad tragic masterpiece. I did see the original Spanish film its was not as philosophical as vanila sky and tom cruse really can act and has a tender soul. It comes through. Bottom line was: living a daydream is not really living, as the sweet can never be sweet without the souer...yig and yang<br/><br/>I would recommend this to anyone that loves sad love storys, fantasy, scify and philosophical films"
"zkonedog","7","1","2","9 March 2017"," How Can You Be 100% Sure You Aren't Dreaming Right Now?
","The strange thing about dreams is that, while in one, the dreamer usually does not realize a dream is taking place. Only upon the conclusion of the dream experience is an individual able to distinguish between dream and reality. That concept is the driving force behind ""Vanilla Sky"".
For a basic plot summary, this movie focuses on David Aames (Tom Cruise), the heir to a vast business fortune who is very much a playboy. At a party one night, David is smitten by exotic beauty Sofia Serrano (Penelope Cruz) and begins a relationship with her. When jealous fling Julie Gianni (Cameron Diaz) finds out, however, she involves David in an accident that will change his life forever. Because this is a ""big reveal"" type of film, I will not say anything more here to prevent spoilers.
There are two primary reasons that ""Vanilla Sky"" is such an extraordinary film:
First, it is very much high-concept. Much like ""Inception"", or ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"", this movie deals with dreams and how they affect the dreamers. This plot line is almost guaranteed to make you think while viewing, and it will likely be still rattling around in your brain for awhile after viewing.
Secondly, though, is that a film like ""Vanilla Sky"" can only work if it contains incredible character development, which it indeed achieves. In order to truly appreciate both the ending and the overall journey, both the writing and acting must be spot-on. It is, and as such will leave you feeling as if you truly care about the struggles of David Aames and his world.
Overall, ""Vanilla Sky"" is an excellent concept film that ranks right up there with ""Eternal Sunshine"", ""Memento"", ""The Matrix"", and the like. It even has very much of a romantic aspect for those who enjoy high emotion. Simply put, the only people this movie won't appeal to are those purely wanting action/adventure. This one will make you think, but it is more than worth it in the end.<br/><br/>(After a recent re-watch, I dropped this movie down from 10/10 to 7/10 stars. This film has lost a bit of its luster for me in the re-watch process and feels a bit dated. The themes are still interesting and the concept is high, but it has been knocked off the lofty pedestal I once perched it on)."
"Hitchcoc","9","1","2","11 January 2017"," It's Quite Innovative and Highly Engaging
","Even if I don't always like Tom Cruise, the man, mainly because of his pomposity and his L. Ron Hubbard stuff, I seem to really enjoy his movies. In this one, his character is much like him. He is not heartless, but not far from it. He is spoiled and entitled. He has expectations of others, including women, that he is the be all and end all. One day his life changes when he is in a car with the Cameron Diaz character, whom he actually exploits. She is willing to kill both of them rather than live without him. What follows is one of the most circumlocative plots, with apparent supernatural elements, dream sequence, cryonics, etc. A criticism of this film would be that it is so bizarrely convoluted, that reality is hard to discern. There is some validity to that, but it also makes it incredibly interesting. Sometimes I'd rather see a director or producer try to exceed their grasp. I would also recommend that the previous film ""Open Your Eyes"" is its own film. Must we always try to demean something because it has an antecedent."

","First off I just want to stress to people who are planning to see this movie,that I didn't know much about the film before i watched it, other than it was a drama/romance and it happened to be directed by Cameron crowe. After seeing Jerry Maguire i decided i had to give this a shot. <br/><br/>I was so glad i saw this before i saw the original movie it was based on, which was a Spanish movie named 'open your eyes'<br/><br/>Now i know that most of the scenes/story is a lot alike the original but by far this is one of the best remakes i have seen in a while. The entire cast is a joy to watch. Not to mention Vanilla Sky has a killer soundtrack which goes amazingly well with the tone of the movie A very strong and convincing performance by Tom Cruise kept me gripped at all times in the movie. <br/><br/>Crowe manages to keep me on the edge of my seat, scene after scene waiting to know what will happen next. Vanilla Sky has all the elements of what it takes to create a magical movie with its delightful chemistry shown between Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz, and to the breathtaking visuals we see. Penelope is very believable in her role and you can't imagine anyone better as the sweet Sophia. <br/><br/>Unexpectedly Cameron Diaz is charismatic and oozing charm even as a supportive character role. <br/><br/>I can guarantee that Vanilla Sky will open your mind and explore every emotion you have attached to you. The story is cleverly portrayed and will not disappoint! I also want to add that watching it twice made me appreciate it even more. There isn't cinema quite like this anymore! <br/><br/>I was disappointed to see that it didn't receive all positive reviews at first, although I think in time it will get the appreciation it so rightfully deserves!<br/><br/>Verdict: Give it a chance.<br/><br/>Chances like this don't come very often..!"

I really liked this movie because it's so emotional, every shot someone say an impacting quote about something, and it really touched me sometimes. People tend not to like this movie so much as I do, I can see, maybe it's a little bit crazy to the casual viewer but too much casual to the hardcore movie person, the director shouldn't have delivered the plot so chewed up, he should have got a little Mulholland Dr. in the third act I guess."

","Vanilla Sky (2001): Dir: Cameron Crowe / Cast: Tom Cruise, Penelope Cruz, Cameron Diaz, Kurt Russell, Jason Lee: Spellbinding film ripe with disturbing yet wondrous visual images straight through to the end. Similar to Mulholland Drive in that it leads a twisted and confusing path that nonetheless still intrigues. It relates to a clash of images that are not entirely there. It stars Tom Cruise who keeps having strange reoccurring dreams. He soon learns that he is up for murder and a white mask consumes his identity. He tells of an accident as his jealous girlfriends drives them over a bridge. The film depends on its bizarre vision and the skill of Cameron Crowe who previously made another great film called Almost Famous as well as direct Cruise to another very different performance in Jerry Maguire. Here Crowe succeeds in a triumph of visual design and imagery. Cruise plays a great victim to his own vanity. Cameron Diaz is excellent as his crazed ex-girlfriend whose image haunts his tortured mind. Penelope Cruz appears as his new love interest in an element that is shockingly double sided. Kurt Russell is terrific as his attorney who tries to help him sort out the confusion. Jason Lee plays an author and friend to the Cruise character, and who introduces him to Cruz before the domino effect that descends from it. Bizarre film about vanity and the dangers of lust.

"NateWatchesCoolMovies","10","1","2","11 January 2016"," An ethereal classic of emotion and visual splendour
","Cameron Crowe's Vanilla Sky leads you on an incredibly picturesque journey into the life of a wealthy publishing heir, played with impressive emotional heft by Tom Cruise. He once had an idyllic life that gave way to some tragic events, and is now in a way station of existential despair, lamenting his sad tale to a sympathetic psychiatrist (Kurt Russell) and daydreaming of his gleaming past. Crowe's films always have an impossibly bright, strikingly beautiful sheen in their composition, displayed here by a distinct urge to forge the melodrama, and melancholy not with dark, muted tones like some craftsmen might, but to keep a vibrantly lit, dreamy aesthetic that never lets go of beauty, even in dark places. Cruise is forced to contend with a jilted, unstable lover (Cameron Diaz) whilst pursuing his angelic dream girl (Penelope Cruz) into realms of thought, feeling and action that ripple through his life like scintillating reflections in a sunlit meadow pond. I'm purposefully being vague and poetic as not to disturb the veil hanging over plot and resolution, for the surprises which lay in wait for you are a riveting rop-a-dope and should be explored with a blank canvas of expectation and complete lack of any previous knowledge about the story. The supporting cast sees very memorable work from Timothy Spall, Jason Lee, Alicia Witt, Tilda Swinton, Michael Shannon, Ivana Milicivec, Johnny Galecki, W. Earl Brown, Tommy Lee and Noah Taylor. Cruise is compelling, finding the confused soul in his creation, Diaz scares wonderfully as the unpredictable live wire, but Cruz steals the show with her usual sweet disposition. This film is based on a Spanish one called ""Abre Los Ojos"" which also starred Cruz in the same role she plays here. This, however, is the superior version, for me a masterpiece and a personal favourite. Crowe makes poetry of light and colour, painting visual splendour that flows flawlessly in tandem with the achingly beautiful soundtrack, another aspect of film he always excels in. And as for the deep well of secrets that is the story? I'll tell you in another life, when we are both cats."

"Screen_Blitz","6","1","2","25 October 2015"," Unnecessarily convoluted and tedious romantic thriller
","Director Cameron Crowe takes a wild and overly complex turn in this mind-bending thriller that demonstrates the complexity and elements of the human mind that many struggle to understand. Tom Cruise stars as David Aimes, a wealthy, inner city publisher and best friend of Brian Shelby (played by Jason Lee), who is in relationship with beautiful blonde Julie (played by Cameron Diaz), but seems to be in love with a Latino woman named Sofia (played by Penelope Cruz). When David is involved in a devastating car accident with Julie that leaves his face horribly disfigured, he begins struggling to tell between dream and reality. Kurt Russell plays psychology doctor McCabe who has David incarcerated and interrogated him on the events leading up to the fateful car wreck. Mixing elements of science-fiction, mystery, and romance, this film is a remake of the 1997 Spanish film Open Your Eyes, which also stars Penelope Cruz and follows the same story structure. <br/><br/>As interesting as the plot and the premise are, I really wanted to like this movie. While I am not saying I hated this movie, there were some major flaws that made this one hard to enjoy. The film sets a promising start with a solid introduction of the characters of Tom Cruise, Cameron Diaz, Jason Lee, and Penelope Cruz. Then there is the intense car crash scene that leaves Tom Cruise's character with a horrendous facial disfigurement. From there on, the plot takes a whole bunch of of twists and turns that are far too confusing for not only the audience to understand, but the confusing for the film itself. This film tries so hard to be interesting but is completely unaware of the direction its trying to take, and it fails to give any sort of hints to what happens and instead leaves the audience consisting speculating. The plot feels like Cameron Crowe took the script and did some experimenting with it but got everything all mixed up. Throughout the story, there some questions left unanswered and scenes that serve no purpose. The cast's performances are decent, but perhaps nothing too impressive. <br/><br/>Vanilla Sky has an intriguing plot and a premise. Overall, this is not a film for everyone and only for those who are fans of Cameron Crowe's works. While it's not totally bad, it would have been better if it the plot was more even and had a better and more structured direction."
"mrlward96","10","1","2","28 August 2015"," Vanilla sky vs Open your eyes
","The ""Open your eyes"" original version has the amazing story and can see why it inspired the creation of ""Vanilla Sky"". However, as these are my favorite movies of all time I can see the difference between them and would like to attempt to explain this.<br/><br/>Open your eyes: An extremely ""real"" feel and vibe that only truly distorts at the end but still keeps it's ""real"" feeling throughout. For me it gave off a sad and very real/plausible story. I found relating and understanding this version to be easier than that of vanilla sky (which I will continue to explain).<br/><br/>Vanilla Sky: This was more an epic tale of a love story gone wrong and constant confusion portrayed throughout the film. This version feels a lot less ""real"" and actually tries to make scenes euphoric (like when the operation starts and the soundtrack ""what if god was one of us"" plays). This version is more for the person who wants to ""feel more"" as realism escapes this version and the sad themes are embraced instead of making the audience feel at a loss (for lack of a better description.) Conclusion: Open your eyes and vanilla sky are equally great. However, if you prefer a better understanding and raw emotion than open your eyes is for you. If on the other-hand you prefer (like myself) euphoric emotion and confusing themes throughout than vanilla sky is for you."

","Every now and again I stumble across a film on TV and think, ""I'll give it a go."" Such was the case with Vanilla Sky, Cameron Crowe's 2001 remake of ""Abre Los Ojos."" Tom Cruise plays David Aames, a money-bags son of a publishing magnet who seems to have inherited it all: Cash, Cameron Diaz as a f**k-buddy, board-room power, a vintage Ferrari, Pete Townsend's smashed guitar in his living room. you know the usual stuff.<br/><br/>So far – so good – so what? If you hadn't worked it out already David iswell bit of a c**k - especially when it comes to the ladies. However, exotic Latino dancer Penelope Cruz hoves into view David goes all gooey, puts his c**k away for a minute and feels a ""connection."" After a night of romantic chat and sofa spooning David skips off into the dawn with a song in his heart and a spring in his step. Cue bad stuff! Extremely bad stuff! David is suddenly accused of a murder, disfigured in a car-accident and plagued by memory-loss, vivid nightmares and an encroaching sense of paranoia. All of this he unloads on the manly shoulders of friendly neighbourhood police psychologist Kurt Russell.<br/><br/>All well and good but we have a problem. I don't care about David. At. All. Tom cruise gives good slime-ball (see Magnolia previously) but in this case it felt like the film's undoing. Are we supposed to have some kind of empathy with this arrogant, breaded, misogynistic t**t? Nope, sorry. Don't care. Emotional investment down the pan. This isn't Cruise's fault, his character is so thinly drawn that the only engagement with him is disengagement. I just didn't care/ To be honest, I just wanted to be rid of his nightmares, flashbacks, murder-charge and incessant whining so I can spend time with supporting cast who seemed a damn sight more interesting.<br/><br/>Ultimately, there's some interesting ideas trying to get out. Is real love transient? The consequence of actions? The power of memory within dreams? But, it all gets lost under a wave of indifference summed up by my mighty, ""Meh"" at the big reveal. You could say it's a precursor to Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind or Inception in scope but that would be bum-bitingly generous. It has neither the ambition, wit or creativity of either.

","Remake of a foreign film, VS is the story of a publisher who has a bad car accident and wakes up to a severely altered reality. The remake is a vehicle for Cruise, who is shown in loving closeup through a large part of the movie. His character stumbles through this altered reality, meeting a beautiful Spanish woman (Cruze) and a sympathetic police psychologist (Russell). He also encounters a strange little man who tries to coax him back into reality. Cruise has always been an acquired taste at best, much like Nic Cage and Keanu Reeves, so your tolerance for this uninspired remake will depend on your affinity for Cruise. What makes the film a bitter disappointment is the last 20 minutes, in which everything that has happened to the bewildered publisher is spelled out in excruciating detail by the strange little man, whose real name is Tech Support (are you starting to get it?). At this point, the film sharply veers away from surreal fantasy into pure sci-fi, and unfortunately its twist ending has been used many times before, sometimes successfully (as in STAY) and more often not. Cruise is simply hammy beyond belief here. If you want to see Cruise actually act, check out the ensemble flick he did several years ago in which he played a horndog motivational speaker. Now, that's acting!"

"jammunro","6","1","2","9 July 2012"," Technically good but let down by acting and dialogue
","I'll begin with the positives. Technically speaking this is an excellent film. Excellently directed, haunting imagery- an abandoned New York being particularly haunting- and an absolute fantastic soundtrack. In fact the soundtrack is easily the best thing about this film. It is almost entirely pitch perfect with excellent artists such as Radiohead, REM, Jeff Buckley and Paul McCartney all seamlessly working into the film.<br/><br/>Now the drawbacks. The acting in this film is not exactly great. Cameron Diaz tries her hardest but her character is very little for a character to do and she just ends up a serious of clichés. Penelope Cruz's character can't seem to match up to her one in the original and just leaves the viewer baffled as to what all the fuss is about. Worst of all however is Tom Cruise himself. I'm not sure if this is just a personal problem I have with Cruise or not. I enjoyed him in Magnolia but everything else he's been in has just annoyed me. He's excellent at playing the cocky spoilt rich kid role that he's been perfecting all his career but when his character takes a dark turn Cruise just doesn't have the chops to pull it off. His brooding in the interrogation scenes is almost unwatchable.<br/><br/>Worst of all, however, is the dialogue. It is clunky and is almost embarrassing when it's being spoken. See for example the attempts to explain the film at the end. It is one of the most boring ways possible to finish a film just by having a character you have barely met lifelessly explain it all. Line after line of it is spewed out by the actors but it never really seems to be going anyone.<br/><br/>This is a great concept for a film and was done exquisitely well .... in the original. For anyone interested in the film I'd recommend the original by far."

We can also find the same idea to buy memories and have the tech support to come to help. In addition, the multiple ideal lover is a thematic very Dickien as well.<br/><br/>This part gives breath to a movie that was rather a bit dull and dragging: the new Quasimodo life of a rich, egoist playboy is laughable: if the biggest challenge he has to face now is to go out and his biggest fear is that his lover would reject his disfigured, well, he knows nothing about life or love as well. As Penelope says, he really has to ""abre los oyos"".<br/><br/>Maybe he deserves his fate after having ""stolen"" the friend of his best friend. But as i done that myself, i think that no red line is crossed because it's among friends not married couples. Moreover, loves needs courage and implies a connection that needs two people to exist, (except maybe in this movie).<br/><br/>This fourth aspect of the movie, love, touched me a lot: This movie was simply the one that gets me into following Penelope's filmography: i remember to have just been struck by the trailer, with her cute accent, her smile, the slam of the door and the song. I always thought it was McCartney but i was surprised to learn that it's actually from his rival, Peter Gabriel and it's called ""Solsburry Hill"". For me, this ""electrical meeting"" ranks among the best scene of that kind in movies: the only other examples that come to my mind is ""Lost Highway"" with ""Magic Moment"" (that is a bit alike) or ""Bluest eyes of Texas"" in ""Boys don't cry"". Well, Penelope did such a great performance that she has added at least one more fan with this movie.<br/><br/>Actually, I know that this movie is a remake of a Spanish film and as it stars luckily Penelope, i will meet you tomorrow after watching it !

I won't spoil the story for anyone who hasn't seen it, because it really is that good and has one hell of a twist.<br/><br/>This really is an underrated cinematic gem. It's a great psychological thriller with a dash of science fiction, but at its heart it's a touching love story. Whenever I watch this film it churns up so many emotions in me. It's a tragic love story, both sad and uplifting. It's the story of a man who has to learn the hard way, the value of life.<br/><br/>This is an incredible film and I recommend it to everyone."

","The problem with this film is that it's a poor scene for scene copy of the far more superior 'Abre Los Ojos' (Open your eyes) the Spanish treatment. Something was lost in translation and all the artistic part of the superior film was sucked out by the casting of Tom Cruise as the protagonist and Cameron Diaz as well. Penelope Cruz tried her best but she was 100 times better in the original version. I tried to like this film but you're gonna have to forgive me because I watched 'Abre Los Ojos' two hours before I embarked on this horrendous journey known as 'Vanilla Sky.' Rent Abre Los Ojos (Open your Eyes) instead and save yourself from one more Hollywood crap-fest film. My apologies to Cameron Crowe(in case you ever stumble upon my comments), I actually like your other stuff."
"funkyfry","8","1","2","4 November 2009"," Fascinating film
","This was a fun movie to go into ""cold"", not having heard much about it. It seems to resolutely straddle a whole mix of genres, starting out seeming like a straightforward romantic dramedy and eventually morphing into a thriller and then a sci-fi film. It's a film about iconography and personality, the way we see our lives and the way we create a sort of universe for ourselves to live in, but in the Cruise character's case quite literally.<br/><br/>Cruise's performance powers the movie, and at times he's very effective. Of course you couldn't find a more suitable actor to play this super-successful and gorgeous guy who's had everything in life. His friend (Jason Lee, who seems so casual that he's distracting) tells him about how you can't enjoy the ""sweet"" without also tasting the ""sour."" It's a simple theme that's developed through the movie in more and less complex ways.<br/><br/>The relationship between Kurt Russell's psychologist character and Cruise's masked ""killer"" David is far more interesting and compelling than his friendship with the Lee character, and even perhaps arguably than the central romance between David and Penelope Cruz' Sofia. I really enjoyed Russell's work, and the moment of his self-realization at the climax is one of the most bizarre and effective moments of character acting in sci-fi genre history. The film is littered with fantastic character performances in fact; Timothy Spall and the always-riveting Tilda Swinton are among the best of these.<br/><br/>Crowe's direction is less literal than usual, more vague and poetic. I still don't like the way he and his collaborators used music in this movie; I found it distracting. I realize that it was part of the whole idea of the iconography that's creating his world (the clue with the ""Freewheelin' Bob Dylan"" cover was TOO obvious), but the mixture of new and old rock songs makes the film feel like it's old people straining too hard to be cool. All the Radiohead and that type of thing gets very tiring, and the choice of older songs like Peter Gabriel's ""Solsbury Hill"" is too typical. I don't like the way ""Solsbury Hill"" was used for example; I really don't appreciate music with lyrics playing over a dialog scene. I find myself listening too much to Gabriel's fascinating lyrics and trying to figure out if they have any connection to the scene, and I missed half of the dialog between Cruise and Cruz.<br/><br/>In the end though, the film is a big winner. It's the type of film that presents a lot of ideas and lets the audience chew them over. We want to know ultimately what is going on, and the climactic revelation manages to still retain some of the original poetry and mystery. That's tough to pull off. Cameron Diaz and Tom Cruise have never been better IMHO; the weird sex scene between them towards the end is very disturbing and effective. The film manages to tackle some big ideas in a really entertaining way, and it's a nice film to look at."
"celticjunkie","9","1","2","22 August 2009"," Tom Cruise at his best
","OK, so I know I am late to this Vanilla Sky party, but I finally watched this DVD after seeing it sit on my shelf for a couple of years, and I was just blown away. I expected to hate it but I loved it, and my husband and I sat spellbound from start to finish. The film is sometimes a dream, then it is reality, then just a dream, it totally messes with your head. Makes you think. Makes you feel.<br/><br/>Definitely, without a doubt, Cruise's best dramatic performance. Fantastic. He starts the film as a playboy, all full of himself, charming. Then he transforms into a bitter, tortured man. Unsettling to see, whether behind the mask or with his disfigurement showing. I felt his anguish.<br/><br/>And Penelope Cruz, long before her brazen performance in Vicky Cristina Barcelona, making us fall for her. Beautiful, heartfelt. And Cameron Diaz is convincing as the messed-up stalker girlfriend you don't quite expect to see. ""Earl"" (Jason Lee) is also good as Cruise's only friend. It took me awhile to realize it was ""Earl,"" because he looks so different in this film.<br/><br/>And the Manhattan exterior shots, how cool were they? The early scene when Cruise is all alone in Times Square. And the skyline! I did get sad when the Twin Towers appeared in the film, during the rooftop scene at the end, and I remembered that there was some hot discussion about the film when it premiered regarding the shot of the WTC and also Cruise diving from a skyscraper, but it reinforces that the setting was real. (Except...... it would not make sense to show the Towers if the last scene takes place far into the future -- the Towers would be gone, I guess. I don't know. Being from NY I guess I am extra sensitive about films with the Towers in them.) Anyway, this is the 3rd ""mind-bending"" film with Cruise that I have seen (Magnolia and Eyes Wide Shut being the other 2) and this is my favorite by a wide margin."

"Tweekums","8","1","2","15 July 2009"," What is reality?
","Before starting to review this film I must say that I have not yet seen the Spanish film on which it is based so can't say whether it does justice to the source material or not. This is one of those films one has to watch more than once to understand as things we learn at the end of the film effect how one views the events earlier on. Often it is impossible to tell if what we are watching is real, a dream or a delusion.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise plays David Aames a yuppie who has inherited his father's publishing empire. He is sleeping with Julie but there is no real relationship in his mind they are just friends who occasionally spend the night together she however believes it means far more than that. At his birthday party David meets Sofia, a beautiful Spanish woman played by Penélope Cruz, he spends some time with her but nothing physical happens. When he sets off for work Julie is there and asks him to get into her car, she then starts raving about how he must love her then crashes her car off a bridge.<br/><br/>Things then start to be fairly strange, one minute David is well and talking to Sofia the next he is seriously disfigured from the accident talking to doctors about how they can help him, at this point all the can offer is a rubber mask which gives him an appearance that is almost like a statue; fairly realistic yet cold and emotionless. He is later told that there is a radical new treatment that will repair his face, he has this and when the mask is removed he is back to his old good looking self. He starts to have nightmares though, sometimes he imagines the disfigurement has returned, other times he thinks that Sofia is in fact Julie. He even believes that he has killed her but isn't certain which one of them. He is taken into custody and his world gets more and more insane, eventually he is taken to a company which specialises in cryogenicly freezing people immediately after they die, here he learns an alarming truth.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise did a great job as David, it is rare to see a good looking major star playing a character which for much of the film is disfigured unless it is the sort of serious film that is angling for awards. Penélope Cruz was also good as Sofia. I'd certainly recommend this to people who like to watch something different and don't mind not understanding everything they see as they see it."

","I've read many comments on that movie here on IMDb, and it looks like 99% of bad reviews has been written by people who didn't understand the movie at all. If you don't understand the movie it doesn't mean it's bad. How can you judge anything if you don't understand it. It's like saying: ""I don't like blue sky because I don't understand why it's blue"". Well bad example maybe (as most normal people like blue sky), but I hope at least some of you will UNDERSTAND what I mean and next time you come across movie like this you'll appreciate it's beauty. It's 2009 when I watched it and to be truthful I haven't seen many such a good movies to date. I appreciate it maybe even more now since there is so few good ones out there nowadays.

"aaron111","9","1","2","7 June 2008"," It's not all explained
","Many will criticize this film for being too bizarre, too pretentious, too confusing. On the other end of the spectrum there will be those that will criticize it for showing us it's hand far too clearly and tying things up too neatly and conveniently. I just want to chime in and respond to all those who are disappointed by the ending - believing it's a let down because it apparently holds your hand through a complete explanation of what preceded and dispels all the intrigue and enigma that has been building. If you watch the film again more carefully - with extra attention to the first scene and the first lines of dialog we hear, you're perspective will probably change. Sprinkled throughout are subtle clues that the ending is not necessarily telling us the truth.<br/><br/>I think Cameron Crowe has done something quite clever with Vanilla Sky - he has given us a enigmatic dreamscape of a film capped by what is apparently an easy and direct explanation. This will (in theory) quiet at least some of the dissatisfaction of a mainstream audience desiring closure and answers and a ""happy ending"" or sorts. But if you look deeper you will find that the ending, rather than being an explanation, only complicates the mystery.<br/><br/>I must admit I avoided seeing this movie for years simply out of dislike for Tom Cruise - I shouldn't have. He perfectly embodies the essence of this character. Cameron Diaz, and especially Penelope Cruz are also perfect in their roles. Penelope Cruz also stared in the original Spanish version of this film - Abre los Ojos (Open Your Eyes). I recommend watching the original if you like Vanilla Sky - it is definitely a strong film in it's own right - but I can honestly say I much prefer Cameron Crowe's version. As critic Richard Roeper put it: if Abre los Ojos is the acoustic version, Vanilla Sky is the symphony. Every scene seems to be packed with more detail and multiple layers of meaning, and the characters are painted with so much more shading and nuance. This was one story that benefited from the Hollywood treatment - the cinematography is fittingly sweeping and epic and the soundtrack is characteristically Cameron Crowe - that is to say perfect - right down to the opening scenes backed by Radiohead's ""Everything in It's Right Place"", which sets the tone perfectly. That ambiguity and interpretability I described is barley present in Abre los Ojos, if at all. In the end I don't really find myself left questioning if everything is as it appears to be. <br/><br/>Vanilla Sky is a movie that has grown on me over time and with repeated viewings, but even after the first time I saw it I immediately had that dizzying feeling of mixed emotions, and a palpable inability to get it out of my head that only happens when you've just witnessed something approaching a masterpiece."

","i found this movie really intriguing right up to the moment where cruise starts running around screaming for 'tech support'..<br/><br/>until then you had this extremely interesting plot with tremendous depth, little in the way of clarity but with an underlying notion that maybe this guy had opted for cryonic freezing at some point (we see/hear adverts for the procedure from time to time)<br/><br/>i could have happily watched the movie until the end without having the heart of the storyline pushed in my face, left instead to figure it out for myself <br/><br/>but no, we are effectively told the plot in the style of a scooby doo episode in usual Hollywood dumbed down fashion. and we're left afterward only to figure out, if we can be bothered, which parts of the film are 'real' and which parts aren't<br/><br/>the film is certainly very weird, and stays with you. but it could have been a great deal better if the makers hadn't been tempted to go for exposure and cheap laughs with the 'tech support' nonsense. for me, that section turned it into a joke movie"

","What can I possibly say that hasn't been already said in the 114 pages before me? How about this: It has been 5 years now. Can we at least admit that the film's popularity has not withstood the test of time? The novelty of a plot twist and beautiful people may win you some ecstatic early reviews, but the arguments that it begins do not have the depth to become the kind of things you will want to share with your children twenty years from now.<br/><br/>Or how about this: I wish I understood Mr. Crowe's motivation in making this film. It lacked the innocent exuberance of Almost Famous, a place where great music made the story better. Here, pretty effects and some good music may create some individually beautiful scenes but they only serve to distract from the tension of the underlying story. Which, in order to be compelling needed all of the tension it could get.<br/><br/>Which reminds me, I would be really excited to see what a minimalist version of Mr. Crowe's work would look like. If he learns (or relearns?) the discipline to cut scenes that, while beautiful in themselves, only distract from the underlying story, will make better movies. It worked for Almost Famous, it was lacking in Elizabethtown. (Just throw them on the DVD as extras. They won't be lost.)<br/><br/>Sad conclusion: It was just an uninteresting film with some good music. It could have been good if the story had not been lost to the eye/mind candy. I have lost respect for his other work because of this one.<br/><br/>I think I'll go back and finish the Decalogue now; you kids have fun out there.

","I've always liked Cameron Crowe's movies - Jerry Maguire being my personal favorite - but I'd not seen Vanilla Sky until this week. When it came out, the previews were less than inspiring, so I avoided it - I didn't want to see CC blow it. Later a friend with Good Taste told me it was pretty good, but I just forgot about it.<br/><br/>I'd like to compare it to another movie I've seen recently to point out some of the things that VS does right where this other, allegedly classic film completely floundered, but I don't want to spoil it for anyone. I will say that while Tom Cat Cruise wasn't his usual flamboyant self in this one, I like him as an actor - even if he is an ass in life. I'll also say that the film is intriguing at the beginning and lulls toward what seems to be the conclusion. Then, just as I began to give up on it, the movie found its feet for a interesting twist in the final minutes.<br/><br/>There's a line very near the ending in which Cruise's character is told that he was careless with someone and it resonates - that's exactly the linchpin of the entire movie, distilled into a single sentence.<br/><br/>As in movies, so it is in life, sometimes. A moment's carelessness can destroy one's entire life, yet it's impossible to be perfect, isn't it?"

","The first and most obvious thing about this film is how perfectly everyone was cast, their on screen characters reflected the actors' real personalities. Tom Cruise plays an eccentric guy who is so full of himself that even those closest to him don't really matter. He's a very wealthy publisher with everything: youth, looks, cars, women, et al. His best friend is played by Jason Lee, a sarcastic and forgiving guy always ready to party. He also works for Cruise as a writer. Cameron Diaz plays another friend of Cruise who also happens to be his booty call. She's a skanky, obsessive beauty with not much going on in her head except for dreams of being with Tom forever. The story begins with Tom Cruise in a jail talking to a psychologist, portrayed by Kurt Russell, about the murder that took place. Kurt is a warm, but firm man who could care, or could care less (if that makes any sense). Cruise begins his story at his birthday party where Jason brings a random girl he just met, who happens to be played by Penélope Cruz. She is a quiet, cute and exotic woman who captivates the attention of Tom, much to the chagrin of Cameron. Tom ends up spending a sleepless night with Cruz drawing caricatures of each other, and talking about random stuff, and invariably fall in love. When he leaves the next morning, he is in a massive automobile accident that crushes his arm and face. I've left out a little there because I don't want to spoil the plot. Cruise wakes from a coma weeks later with a disfigured face, and the surgeons really can't do much about his looks, and he has terrible headaches. He falls into a depression, and is struck with the feeling that he's unwanted by his friends, his company, and even Penélope. Tom finally learns they can repair his face, and things turn his way again. Cruz is finally his, and they live happily until things start happening that Tom's mind cannot reconcile.<br/><br/>The movie is directed by the incredulous Cameron Crowe with the beauty and grace you would expect from him. Vanilla Sky easily slides in and out of beautiful scenes you'd expect from Monet if he did film, and harsh scenes of emotional intensity. The story is well written as well, and very much like Mark Twain's The Mysterious Stranger. There are better movies of this type, but this one does have its own feel to it (thanks to Crowe) that sets it apart as something special. It really is a great film about love, loss, and friendship."

But then, I took the time to watch it and found myself absorbed in a brilliant story that you cared about in so many ways. When a film feels as personal as this, when you feel like it belongs to because of how you see it, thats when you get great movies.<br/><br/>And that's what vanilla sky does, it leaves an impression that doesn't go away.

Abre Los Ojos feels more natural, more realistic, and has that plain, gritty feel of many European movies. The characters feel more real, but the cinematography is also less spectacular than in Vanilla sky. <br/><br/>Vanilla sky while containing plenty of drama and thriller elements, has also more space for humor and playful synergy between the characters. The overall feeling is that you are in a Hollywood fantasy. This lends a lightness to the movie that Abres los Ojos doesn't have. This is also a reason why people might like it less than the original: Abres Los Ojos sticks to the drama, to the story, and the interaction between actors is nearly always serious: the filmmaker wants you to believe this is actually all happening and it's no joke. The acting is in any case good in both movies. Whichever movie you chose to watch first is going to diminish the experience of watching the other version.

Crowe has nothing on Amenabar, and shame on Cruise for thinking he could top Noriega's performance by being a schmuck.<br/><br/>Also, Cruise's ""schmucky"" performance made the continuity of this film completely bizarre. There were some very strong scenes that called for a very different performance/script. Whether it's the screenwriter's fault for not adjusting the mood of the scene or Tom Cruise for being such a schmuck, it just simply doesn't work.<br/><br/>As a standalone movie, I'd give it a 6.

Cameron Diaz acts and amazing role as Julie Gianni, inciting one to almost despise Cameron for her less than noble actions as Julie. Only the part of Dr. Curtis McCabe (Kurt Russell) made me feel as if it were lacking due to forced development and seeming one-dimensionality (Although it could be attributed to his main character flaw revealed at the end).<br/><br/>Despite many other reviews, I found the soundtrack not at all obtrusive or overdone as some may claim, but quite essential to the emotional flow of ""Vanilla Sky"". Every musical tone perfectly fitting the scene, even though it may seem absurd to use at face value. Perfect example being ""Good Vibrations"" by the Beach Boys when it is used, ordinarily an upbeat party tune, now portraying panic and revelation.<br/><br/>Central to the movie is the questioning of what really matters in life. What is happiness? David's struggle is truly an emotional experience once everything is displayed to the audience.<br/><br/>If you are someone who does not like to think deeply about a movie, get lost very easily in a story or have attention deficit, please stay away from ""Vanilla Sky"".

This is not straight forward, you wont understand it first time around, if you want to be spoon fed then this is not the film for you.

This would have been a better movie without Tom Cruise...in my humble opinion, ""understating"" always beats ""overacting"", something beyond Cruises comprehension, based on his body of work. Tom Cruise is a generally lousy actor who is ALWAYS playing ""Tom Cruise"" on and off the camera, and to give him his props, he is a very successful ""personality"" (but so too is Paris Hilton...). ....gotta go..renting COCKTAIL again tonite..kinda like a bad car crash, you just can't look away...poor Tom Cruise-as-COCKTAIL bartender, he just CAN'T even wander into a 7-11 without every member of the female gender-clerks, shoppers, vendors, nuns, whatever... shimmying out of their panty hose!!! Men commit suicide!! Lesbians IMMEDIATELY become straight! HE""S JUST THAT GOOD LOOKING!!!! REALLY!!!ASK HIM!!!HE IS!!!!"

","My first review so here goes...<br/><br/>If, like me, you look for something different in a movie, look no further. The gist here is that our hero, the rich and successful David Aames, is struggling to come to grips with a disfigurement caused in a terrible car accident by his stalking friend. We then are teased into wondering how much of David's reality is, well real, leading to a moment of realisation to the tune of said 'Good Vibrations'. Well, like I said, my first review, I can only go up from here but watching this film is like dawn on a calm summers day, freshness in the air and the sunrise on your face leaving you feeling inspired and glad to be alive. The cinematography is just stunning and the views of New York (including the famous empty Times Square shot) express the city like never before. Like him or Loath him, Cruise is great at conveying the feeling of confusion, that he is trapped in a surreal world that doesn't quite make sense. There's not much that could make this movie better for me, watch it and make your own mind up. Just make sure you watch it !"
"TyroneJ1984","8","1","2","27 March 2006"," A Powerful and Moving Film
","Tom Cruise delivers an excellent performance in Vanilla Sky, a remake of the Spanish film Abre Los Ojos, a tale of reality, imagery, deception and love.<br/><br/>Cruise plays successful businessman David Aames, a man who can have anything his heart desires, he is rich and powerful. An intimate affair with his female friend Julie Gianni (Cameron Diaz) proves to be ultimately his undoing and lead to a turn of surreal, confusing events.<br/><br/>He meets the beautiful yet naive Sofia (Penelope Cruz) whom he instantly falls in love with, however Julia becomes jealous of their closeness and seeks revenge against the man she loves, driving her car off a bridge with David and herself in the car, killing her and leaving David severely disfigured.<br/><br/>After the crash David becomes a shadow of his former self, becoming paranoid about his appearance, having the most disturbing dreams and falling to understand why he sees the dead Julia everywhere he goes.<br/><br/>David eventually succumbs to his paranoia and delusions, ending up in custody charged with a murder he believes he didn't commit, along the way we meet psychologist Curtis McCabe (Kurt Russel) and David's lifelong friend Brian Shelby (Jason Lee), all the while believing that Julia has somehow framed him for her ""murder"" with the help of his enemies.<br/><br/>The film ends with onr of the most powerful and compelling scenes I have ever witnessed, David's delusions are explained with a twist to end all other film twists, however David's journey is far from over, he must now make another choice, his true moment of choice.<br/><br/>A truly excellent film. 8/10."
"pyxlax","8","1","2","10 December 2005"," good movie, with great theme !!!
","All right, so it starts a little weird, but as you keep watching everything starts to unfold in a beautiful way, especially in the conclusion of the film, where Edmond tells David the truth about all the strange events that have been taking place in David's life, a powerful love story of David and Sofia gets wasted, as we later see in the movie. A movie worth watching, good acting by cast, good direction by Cameron Crowe. He really touches the true element of the movie, as did the original one, 'Open Your Eyes', which of course was little consequences decide for the path of your life. I suggest watching it for anyone who hasn't watched it."
"hcrsteeves","9","1","2","23 August 2005"," Cannot be summarized in one sentence.....
","So much has been written about this film and I must say if forced to pick an all time favorite this would be it for me. Some call it confusing and it can be. I find it particularly interesting that the filmmaker, Cameron Crowe, apparently allows the audience to have their own interpretation of the film. All I can say is if you've only seen it once you've missed a lot. Some have said that the film reveals something different every time they watch it. Is the ENTIRE FILM a dream or not? The tech support character refers to a ""splice"" as to where he chose the ""lucid dream"" to begin but who knows??? Perhaps that is a dream too. Definitely a film to be watched again and again. If you haven't seen the film you'll understand why."

","I've channel surfed and seen this film or bits and pieces of it late at night on various premium cable channels the past few months and still get caught up in the spell of it. The visuals and scene shifts and segues are mesmerizing, especially late at night. I finally got the DVD and the ability to slow down and analyze scenes and structure as well as hear the director comments really enhances the experience. This film is very much a life lesson and appreciated more with repeated viewings. There is Buddhist psychology and underpinnings of Zen, related to karma, becoming awake, interconnectivity of people and things, good actions, form and emptiness, craving and clinging and aversion. Given the opportunity to experience a reincarnation to another life which is more authentic and rewarding, David Aames has a choice to make under a vanilla sky - risk everything and confront his ultimate fear."
"profikscreations2","10","1","2","26 July 2005"," This movie was great
","I really like this movie. I know a lot of people who didn't like it but the main reason was because they didn't understand it at all. I especially like after the third time I watched it since I understood it completely. When you understand all the events in this movie you maybe have a chance of liking it more. The music was great in fact I bought the soundtrack it's really good. The actors are also good in the movie but the thing that impressed me the most has to be the images and the visual aspect. The setting is wonderful and I also like the story. It also made me think a lot imagine if one day there was actually a kind of Lucid Dream and that your whole life could be based on a dream."

","In the scene in the beginning when he is all alone in time square, as he is running down the street, a quick flash of a poster with Katie Holmes appears. Just thought it was interesting because this movie was made almost 5 years before they met(and got engaged).She's about 19 in the picture. Anyway I really like this movie. It's sort of peacefully depressing in a happy way. (?figure that out?) I've seen it three times and i'll still probably watch it again. To anyone who has not yet seen it, I would recommend seeing it at least twice because the second time I watched it I caught all the little things that really add to the film."
"moviemanMA","7","1","2","11 July 2005"," So much to say, but I am speechless...
","Cameron Crowe has written and directed some pretty good movies over the years. Starting with Say Anything in 1989, Jerry McGuire in 1996, and Almost Famous in 2000. But these movies don't compare to the complexity and splendor that is Vanilla Sky.<br/><br/>In this American version of Abre los Ojos, Tom Cruise stars as David Aames, a rich publisher, thanks to his father, who has it all. His ""buddy"" named Julie (Cameron Diaz) is a little jealous about him meeting this girl at a party named Sophia (Penelope Cruz), who he was introduced to by his client and best friend Brian (Jason Lee). Brian is falling for Sophia but is sort of OK with Daivd making the first move. Julie becomes jealous and crashes her car with David in it. She dies and David is left disfigured. Basically, David's entire life is starting to turn upside down and doesn't even know what is real and what isn't. Intertwining throughout the movie is David talking to Dr. Curtis McCabe (Kurt Russell) in prison, awaiting his sentence for a crime he doesn't think he committed. What happens next is hard to explain, and also would ruin the movie.<br/><br/>This movie couldn't have been written any better. Cameron Crowe is on the top of his game. This smart, entertaining story of what happens to a man when reality seems to slip away is magnificent. The five main characters are phenomenal. Cruise, Cruz, Diaz, Russell, and Lee all give some of their best work to date. Although the plot seems to be confusing at times, Crowe does a nice job of explaining everything so it all ties together nicely. <br/><br/>Vanilla Sky is a masterpiece. The screenplay is reminiscent of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Everyhthing put together makes Vanilla Sky one hell of a ride. ""This is a revolution of the mind..."""
"Extraordinary_Machine","7","1","2","8 May 2005"," Like Alejandro Amenábar before him, Cameron Crowe can't really balance the romance/drama and mystery/thriller elements too well...
","Vanilla Sky<br/><br/>David Aames (Tom Cruise) is a young and wealthy womaniser, who has a slightly jealous best friend, Brian (Jason Lee). At David's birthday party, he meets Brian's date, Sofia (Penélope Cruz), and instantly warms to her, and they end up spending the night together, but only enjoying each other's company. When Julie (Cameron Diaz), one of David's latest conquests who has been developing an unhealthy obsession with him, crashes her car with him in the passenger's seat, it leaves David horribly disfigured. Feeling his life is essentially over, David becomes withdrawn and angry, but his relationship with Sofia helps him to see the world in a new light. He cheers up even more when he learns of the possibility that doctors may be able to reconstruct his facial features, but everything changes when a face from the past comes back to haunt him.<br/><br/>It's great that Channel Four broadcast the 1997 Spanish original 'Open Your Eyes' the night before this Hollywood remake, 'Vanilla Sky' (which is also good, but suffers from the same problems), was broadcast. Problems, you say? Well, writer/director Cameron Crowe has made a very interesting, involving film, but like Alejandro Amenábar before him, he can't really balance the romance/drama and mystery/thriller elements too well. 'Sky' feels kind of uneven, even though the plot is fresh and surprising. However, the performances are good, and I can see why Cameron Crowe decided to rehire Penélope Cruz for the remake, as she really is a radiant presence. Just a note, though: this film is more of a romance, while 'Open Your Eyes' is more of a thriller, so I guess your preference depends on which genre you like more, I suppose. I don't have a favourite out of the two, so I think they are both good...just not great.<br/><br/>~ 7/10 ~"
"TC-Batsy","10","1","2","28 March 2005"," Tom Cruise the Mysterious One
","Vanilla Sky is a unique and great movie. It makes you think and wonder what has really happened to the protagonist (David Aames), and whether the entire movie is based on his dreams, or not? Tom Cruise was terrific when he portrayed David Aames, a wealthy playboy who doesn't know how to keep his promises, especially when it comes to having sex with Julia whom he doesn't love. During his birthday party, David meets the lovely Sophia who captures his heart despite being his best friend's new girlfriend. He soon finds himself drawn to her and in love at the same time. But everything ends tragically for David when Julie takes him for drive in her car and attempts to kill him as a punishment for his disloyalty towards her. She dies in the accident that leaves him with a disfigured face and in a coma for three weeks. In my humble opinion, I think that David's dilemma, as well as his love affair with Sophia both change him emotionally as he tries to overcome all the errors that he made in his lifetime. Finally, Vanilla Sky is a combination of science-fiction, thriller, mystery and romance for those who like to understand movies from a different point of view."
"garethhjones","9","1","2","3 March 2005"," Vanilla Sky - every time I watch it I see something else I've missed before.
","Tom Cruise is not my favourite actor by any means but I was so impressed with this film that I went to see it twice in one week (and enjoyed it more the second time than the first). It's such a multi-layered story that none of the people I know who have seen it can agree on what it's central message is - or whether Tom Cruise's character is experiencing a dream within a dream. This is backed up by the other reviews I've read none of which seems to be reviewing the Vanilla Sky I went to see. In my opinion, it's a life lesson about the fact that unless you've had it sour in your life, you'll never be able to appreciate the sweet. So instead of regretting the rough times in our lives, we should realise it's these bad experiences that make us appreciate the good times even more when they come along."

","This was a silly remake of Amenabar's brilliant masterpiece ""Abre Los Ojos"", complete with all the cocky, cliché ""Sho Me da Money""-type lines so famous in Jerry Maguire. I have nothing against Jerry Maguire (it's a great movie) but this remake is so overproduced, it could only be American. Even Cameron Diaz and Jason Lee's performances were....well, silly.<br/><br/>Admittedly, the story paralleled the original. However, as with everything else done in America, it had to be done in a $$$Grande$$$$ fashion and in doing so it lost a lot from the Spanish version to the American version.<br/><br/>My advice, watch the original to see a truly good movie."
"eidos-2","7","1","2","22 January 2005"," Please Credit the Original Film
","I was surprised to see there is nothing on this page for ""Vanilla Sky"" that mentions that this is a remake of a Spanish movie from 1997 (except for the Spanish title attached to the writers' names).<br/><br/>Last night I watched the movie called ""Open Your Eyes"" (Abre Los Ojos), a Spanish with English subtitles. I turned it on in the middle of the movie and I was surprised to see that it seemed an awful lot like ""Vanilla Sky"". The more I watched it, the more I realized it was exactly the same story.

I love ""Vanilla Sky"" and that's the reason I wanna know about the disco that appeared on the film. I wanna go there when I travel to New York, like doing a ""Vanilla Sky Tour"". In DVD version Cameron Crowe comments the movie. I thought that in the scene of the disco he'd say some information about the disco, but he didn't. It makes me think the disco doesn't really exists. I wrote these lines with the hope somebody can tell me if that disco really exists."
"justinmo-1","7","1","2","26 November 2004"," Excellent movie, makes a brilliant innovation of a worn cliché
","I realized how highly I thought of this movie only on the second viewing when I couldn't remember how it ended. It is coherent without being transparent, a great achievement in movie storytelling. I remembered several endings as the movie unfolded; all of which were true and none of which were the conclusive one. It takes many twists and turns, all enthralling and ends with the worst twist in movies, ""It was all a dream.!"" but that's not the end of it either. I thought of a joke that I must share.<br/><br/>Variety may be the spice of life but Vanilla Sky is the splice of life. You have to watch it really to get that. A great movie I reckon."
"fieldy","5","1","2","22 November 2004"," Hmm...
","When a film starts how Vanilla Sky does, a dream sequence followed by a relatively routine day of what seems like the 'typical Tom Cruise character', then out of the blue we cut to Cruise being interrogated about a murder, some strange mask covering his face... I generally sit up and take notice!<br/><br/>Unfortunately somewhere a little bit down the track it goes a bit astray - can't really pinpoint one exact scene or moment when it happens, but for some reason I started caring less and less what was going to happen.<br/><br/>A big part of it is the heavy-handedness - it's over-long and certain scenes are dragged out to painful lengths. The music is pretty good (Radiohead's 'Everything In Its Right Place' is perfect for the opening scene) but overused - it seems that every minute there's another song playing. I know Crowe likes music but try to keep it subtle.<br/><br/>The cast does a good enough job, but I think Cruise has it tough - he's just not convincing enough, he's kind of playing himself half the time, then hamming it up the rest of the time. Diaz, Cruz and Russell are OK, I like Lee but the part's not right for him. And Noah Taylor is almost the downfall of the entire film for me. He was just so stilted, but his character was so important to the last twenty minutes or so, he made me want to switch it off. Then again I was losing interest by then.<br/><br/>Basically, there's more twists here than I can readily recall in any film - enough to keep you vaguely entertained for 136 minutes. But at the end I wondered whether it was really all worth it. I haven't seen the original but I imagine it's better, well at least more succinct at about 20 minutes shorter.<br/><br/>It's certainly interesting, but ultimately long-winded and clunky..."
"hartmutw","3","1","2","2 November 2004"," Wannabe clone of ""Eyes wide shut"" or ""Memento""
","It became quite fashionable in recent years to make confusing movies, with many of them changing perspectives or moving back and forth in the story. That goes very well and adds to tension and atmosphere in well thought-through plots like Eyes wide shut or Memento.<br/><br/>It goes terribly wrong though if director and producer basically do not know what they want to tell us and what the true message of a movie should be. All of this is the case in Vanilla Sky, which makes this movie a complete vase of time unless you enjoy the beautiful looks of Cruz / Diaz or Cruise.<br/><br/>It could have been either a nice yet conventional or a true sci-fi movie but it wanted to be a little bit of everything. While you are struggling for more than 2 hours to keep up with all the changes in perspectives and perception, there is nothing you get in return. Quite a let down."
"josechu21","Null","1","2","15 September 2004"," Cruise still has to grow up.
","I think that Tom Cruise still makes (Produces) movies for teenagers. He still doesn't know how to do films for people who have lived enough.<br/><br/>He should try not to think too much and leave the script and ideas to others.<br/><br/>The changes from Abre Los Ojos in Vanilla Sky seems to be made by a teenager playing to be a director. It looks like somebody who hasn't live a real life and is always living in a movie. A person who can not stop and live the life. <br/><br/>Abre los ojos is a better film because is more credible, it's more real and logical than Vanilla Sky.

"lb33","Null","1","2","18 June 2004"," Think people think....
","I find, too often, that the average American movie watcher does not open his/her mind to the possibility that todays screen writers and directors may actually intend for their movies to possess some sort of meaning. Think people, seriously. When I first viewed Vanilla Sky I was blown away; shortly after the final scene I quickly realized its meaning, which was apparently, so ""poorly"" portrayed to the rest of the American public. Ever hear of symbolism? If only we didn't take everything for face value maybe we would be enlightened more often.<br/><br/>Lets get started and stop me if you think anything I have to say is inaccurate or illogical. Warning MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD!<br/><br/>What do most believe heaven is like? Most people have expressed that heaven is different for everyone; that every individual who is fortunate to reach gods kingdom has the ability to create his/her own version of heaven. The individual can do whatever he/she chooses, create their own desired environment, surround themselves with whomever they choose. Now what in the movie parallels this meaning of heaven? LUCID DREAMS! David Aames is not dreaming the whole movie, he is in his own heaven, the one he created for himself. One where he can be surrounded by people that comfort him such as Dr. McCabe, walk down a street which he enjoys such as the one pictured on his favorite album cover, live the rest of his life with the woman of his dreams, etc...And the reason he is haunted by images of Julie is because his self conscious, which is filled with guilt has created for him a sort of purgatory where he must face his demons and resolve his internal conflicts. Any of this making sense??<br/><br/>Secondly, Life Extension or LE, was the most obvious to me. The corporation which allows people to ""extend"" their lives, represents the fact that many feel that life is ETERNAL! that our soul and spirit live on forever. So, Life Extension equals Life ETERNAL or eternal life.<br/><br/>Next, Tech support, simple, a guardian angel, assigned to assist Davis in times of need. <br/><br/>Lastly, we come to the finale of the movie, where David must choose to either ""wake up"" or continue his ""lucid dream"". Again, symbolism right in front of you. Would David rather take a chance and live life again, (REINCARNATION anyone?) or continue his lucid dream (stay in heaven) and live out his eternal fantasy . In addition David's plunge off the side of the infinitely tall building, was simply portraying the act of falling back to earth.<br/><br/>I hope that you now have a new outlook on the movie, and can enjoy it the way I did. Re-watch it please and you'll see that what I have put together makes perfect sense. Do you think its just a coincidence that a vanilla sky (the TITLE of the movie!) looks so damn angelic and heavenly...I think not! Anyone feeling enlightened yet? :)"
"DeCharles","Null","1","2","28 May 2004"," Enjoyable
","It depends on what you like... If you like a movie that ties everything up for you in a nice bow, then this ain't your movie. If you don't like to think during a movie, you likely won't enjoy it. A thinking audience is what makes this movie enjoyable, and almost interactive. So if you like layers- deep corridors of pleasantly distracting dialogue, and creative plot twists, then you will enjoy this quite a bit. My recommendation is to view yourself more than the movie the first time you watch it. Learn your own reactions and responses, but keep your speculations to a minimum. After the initial viewing, you can enjoy analyzing this movie as many times as you want. The people in this movie are beautiful to look at. There is a dark undertone, and if that's your thing, you'll find the ambiance very comfortable. The soundtrack starts off well and gets better. By the end of the movie, the music haunts you as much as the plot. The camera angles and filming are intoxicating. When you see a very empty Times Square, keep in mind that there's no computer animation here, that's really Times Square on a Sunday morning-it's amazing that they were able to do that.<br/><br/>For me, this movie was pure candy, and the flavor sticks around for a while. Spoilers follow.<br/><br/>A few beginning scenes may make one wonder where the splice actually happened. But then the main character's dreams are prominent and sometimes nearly prophetic in the film, so one can still take the splice explanation at face value. Also, after the splice happens it is interesting to witness the dialogue from the perspective of how life would unfold for David if he could always have his way. You get to see what David really wants for the people around him right after the spice. Especially how much he wanted his best friend to be his own person, and for his love interest to believe in him. Then as the Lucid Dream System's glitch rears its ugly head, David's happiness is suddenly punctuated with horrible and bizarre events. The fun in analyzing is watching the different perspectives unfold. Its fun to wonder why he chose the splice to happen on the day it did. Why didn't he choose the splice to happen before the accident? Was he willing to remember the disfigurement for the sake of keeping his stalker dead even in his Lucid Dream? The pinnacle of this movie can change at each viewing as well. It may be the moment he realizes he is in a dream, it may be the moment of the splice, or it may be the moment he decides to get in the car with his stalker. The weight to relevance of this film's many circumstances shifts more than the NASDAQ. The time line for the film is a sort of buffet- a bit of this, a touch of that. When one adds dream sequences between scenes of bliss and System Glitch to these time jumps, you end up with a delightful thinking person's plot. There are concepts in the movie that are fun to let your brain chew on. For instance, a scene that I found most amusing was when David screams for Tech Support. Wouldn't it be cool if when life started to suck, one could scream for Tech Support, and have someone show up and make everything okay? The movie proposes deep questions like how to measure the quality of life. Is a pleasurable and stimulating life worth less when it is orchestrated, rather than created by chance? Which would you choose? When you do finally learn what really happened, your head is spinning so much that you might miss the explanation. If you chose to watch it over again, you will notice something new or different every time. The backgrounds and dialogue have new things to discover and look for as well. Pop culture, trivia, and innuendo were liberally spread about in the set and script. Finally, the plot gives enough wiggle-room for the viewers to decide on the reality for themselves. Favorite quote: 'You're dead and I'm frozen... and I love you.'"
"ryanconi","10","1","2","11 May 2004"," great ""thinking"" movie
","The first time that I saw Vanilla Sky I was dragged by my girlfriend and thought it would be a sappy love flick.  To my surprise, this was not true at all. Vanilla Sky is by far my favorite movie of all time and I have seen a very large amount of movies that one might consider great. Vanilla Sky takes the cake in my list. As I read other people's comments I couldn't help but think that maybe people dislike it because they don't understand it. People today want everything hand fed to them in a movie with a big explosion at the end or the bad guy being caught. This is not the movie for that type of movie lover. This is a great movie if you love to think long after the film is over. Only after you have seen it and understand it can you truly enjoy it. If you have never seen it, or if you didn't quite understand it then you should go see it again."

She was perfect as the ex-girlfriend of Tom Cruise who is obsessed with him and will try to do anything to get him back, even killing herself-hmmm, that might be a spoiler. Tom Cruise's face actually kind of scared me when he was ran off the road. This film was actually very weird. I got confused sometimes, what was going on throughout it.

","It's hard to imagine a more disappointing follow-up to Cameron Crowe's delightful, captivating ""Almost Famous"" than this confused disaster, which is long on long and short on everything else.<br/><br/>This is the kind of movie that needs a killer performance to ""save"" it--something to sink your teeth into and distract you from the fact that the story itself has little impact or interest.  Tom Cruise can't do it--not that he's incapable (I actually think he's rather underrated), but the character is a loser of a protagonist.  He's too self-satisfied early on and too self-pitying later to be even remotely likable.  I like Jason Lee a lot, so I'm sorry to say that his tacked-on buddy character doesn't cut the mustard either.<br/><br/>Then we get to the ladies...OK, deep breath.  I really, truly mean it when I say that Cameron Diaz and Penelope Cruz are probably the two worst actresses in Hollywood that aren't working for Vivid Video.  On top of this, as luck would have it, they decided to reserve their worst respective performances for ""Vanilla Sky."" Both of them are positively grating.  ""When we come back as cats.""  I hope someone backs over you with their car. <br/><br/>
Crowe deserves as much blame as the cast--he fails to inject any sort of urgency into the film--though probably not through lack of trying.  For example, nice try switching the girls back and forth with alternate shots...too bad Spike Lee made much more compelling use of the same trick a decade earlier in ""Mo' Better Blues.""  This movie didn't need gimmickry and trickery--it needed someone to grab hold of the story and really tell it. Instead, it sort of wanders along, and the big plot twist comes long after all our interest is lost.<br/><br/>A real bomb of a movie--avoid at all costs."

","I remember sitting in a cinema getting goosebumps when penelope cruz whispers ""open your eyes"" at the beginning of this movie. I must be honest, I'd seen trailers and thought it looked great but I never would have guessed what the film had in store for me. Like the first flash forward to Tom Cruise in a cell talking about a murder he had supposedly commited, just completely rattled and excited me. Upon watching this film time and time (and time) again on DVD I still believe it to be the best example of how a film should be made. How Cameron Crowe weaved this story from scene to scene, from dream to nightmare to reality is truly remarkable. Tom Cruise at his very best (even though he has been at his best in several other films ie. Magnolia, Jerry Maguire), more so than usual, so open and completely stripped of ego, his performance as David Aames is just magnetic and astonishing to watch. Support (although they all hold the pieces together so perfectly) from Kurt Russell, Jason Lee, Cameron Diaz, Penelope Cruz and Timothy Spall (all already proven to be great actors) just shine. So convincing, so cleverly woven, so intricate i honestly cant say enough, the cast support in this movie warrants recognition, absolutely perfect. In short this movie IS perfection, although i would have liked to see more on the DVD. Simply magnificent, there are only very few movies that hit this standard."

","I first went to the theater to see this with my girlfriend....needless to say I fell asleep half way through...she somehow stayed awake through the whole thing and we both immediately wrote it off as a horrible film.  It just showed on HBO and I finally decided to sit through it and actually watch it this time, and my opinion hasn't changed.  As another reviewer put it, Vanilla Sky tries TOO HARD to be clever.  I got the gist of the film from the first 20 minutes and the last 15 minutes.  That's all I needed. Everything else in between is useless.  I read all the people talkin about this movie, saying that whoever doesnt like this movie don't like to think and 'don't know anything about movies', and so on and so forth. Okay..... its one thing to try and bring a story with deep meaning and insight into film....but its another thing to cram a bunch of philosophical, sci-fi babble into a film and pass if off as 'clever' and 'imaginative'.  That's exactly what Crowe does with Vanilla Sky.  Amazingly, in trying to do all of that it STILL finds a way to come off as boring.  Now I get the whole thing about getting a second chance at life, and finding happiness and true love and such...but CMON!<br/><br/>Experiencing Vanilla Sky is like me asking someone to do a puzzle while I slowly drop its pieces onto the canvas as the person tries putting it together....only to then bring the person the puzzle almost put together with a few pieces still missing.  It's all a big MESS!  I see what they were trying to do with the story, but they couldn't present it better than this???  A bunch of ill conceived, drawn out, disjointed sequences that has no irrelevance, to the point where the story itself is lost??  Vanilla Sky represents a cop out in filmmaking, its that simple.  ""Lets just confuse the HELL out of them for 2 hours and in the last 20 minutes just explain everything that just happened"".  What's the point?  It's all a waste of time.  The only thing that matters by the end of the movie is, as I said, everything up until the car crash and the last 15 minutes on the roof. The story was executed SO POORLY, that anything other than those two parts is just an excuse to drag the story along.  This movie was TERRIBLY executed. It could've been so much better if it was organized and constructed better.<br/><br/>*1/2 out of **** stars"

","A sublime (though not totally original) mixture of generic metaphysical celluloid history:  stir up Jacobs Ladder with Total Recall, add a smattering of It's a Wonderful Life, a dash of City of Angels...with the best bits of cyberpunk, and there you have it. What sets this film apart from the plethora of post-dead shockers are very strong performances.  Tom Cruise's masked man carries all the pathos and dread of Lon Chaney's Phantom of the Opera, and the movie really does keep you guessing right up to the very end. This film touches on genuinely profound philosophical areas, and is never resolved in this regard.  The mind/body distinction is barely explored to any degree of satisfaction, yet the movie leaves one with a sense of intellectual stimulation that signals it to be far greater than the sum total of all of its many parts.  Without doubt a work of flawed genius."

","Anyone that says they didn't understand this movie, or needed hours of analysis to figure it out just aren't that smart.  The last 15 minutes of the movie spells out the plot in minute detail.  While I don't think it necessarily needed that level of explanation, the story itself is one of the best movie stories in recent history.  It's also a movie that on subsequent viewings offers so many clues and hints as to what's REALLY going on, that you can't help but admire the superb craftsmanship.<br/><br/>(Spoilers) While I don't think Crowe could have done a much better job explaining it, my explantion, taking the final scene at face value: Everything up until the nightclub scene (with David in the white mask) is real.  That night is the last night he ever really sees Sofia (and only, what, the third time ever). He is so depressed, lonely, and ravaged by headaches, he signs a contract with Life Extension (with the Living Dream option).  Sometime later he commits suicide by taking some pills, and LE comes and takes his body and puts it in cryogenic suspension.  They wipe out his memory of everything after the nightclub night, and start his living dream at that point.  He uses his limited memory of Sofia to create the perfect woman and the perfect life.  But, like any piece of software, the Living Dream v1.0 has a few glitches.  Either due to that, or the power of David's own subconscious, his living dream goes haywire.  Tech support from LE tries to intervene at several points, but David doesn't understand until the end.  At the end, tech support tells him they can fix the glitches in his living dream and he can go on in his suspended state, without all the killing and prison and stuff.  Or, he can be brought out of suspension (it's 150 years later, and they can fix his face and his headaches).  He decides he wants to wake up and live in the real world.  Simple!"

","This movie is simply 'great' and shows Tom Cruise to be a much more credible actor than hes given credit for. In addition Cruz and Russell give great performances. The movie itself gives an immaculate look at modern day society and its obsessions, greed and vanity. Moreover Vanilla Sky is captivating and intriguing and will therefore have you and you're friends discussing the film long after the closing credits. The film is a 'must-see' and consequently i am bewildered by the negative press the film has obtained, most notoriously here in the UK. The movie's admittedly a lot darker and complex than your usual Tom Cruise blockbuster, but surely we should applaud this? Having read some of the comments about this film, it only increases my negative stereotype of the general public. God forbid an actor such as Tom Cruise should try something different in his career. Thus my only conclusion is, by putting Cruise on the poster (attracting teenage girls) the film's attracted a certain kind of audience, one with the lack of intelligence to enjoy a clever remarkable film for its own merits."

","**Spoilers**<br/><br/>I saw this film on Sky last night and I have to say it wasn't at all what I was expecting. I had no idea that after the crash things would go so dreamlike and strange. I am glad I hadn't read too much about the plot as it would have ruined the entire film just like if you already knew the ending to The Others or The Sixth Sense.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this movie, it was disjointed and confusing in places but this all kind of makes sense at the end when you discover most of the film was a lucid dream. The idea that Cruises character had ruined everything by getting in the car with Diaz was a little tragic. At the nightclub when things start going wrong you can't help but feel a little sorry for him, as his brain has been affected too, and he ends up pushing away the only woman he's ever cared for. I found the story gripping and I never quite knew what was happening. My thoughts would be changing every other scene as I first thought he was being tricked so the board could get rid of him, then I thought maybe he HAS killed someone because he's going mad, then finally it all became clear. There were some great performances from the cast which helped move the far-fetched plot along. A special mention must go to the soundtrack too, which i thought was perfectly suited and helped bring out the emotion in the film.<br/><br/>I would recommend everyone watches this film at least once, it's the kind of film you have to see for yourself. If I had gone on other peoples opinions I would never have seen it and I personally found it ultimately moving. This movie has the ability to really touch you or leave you cold, depending on what kind of person you are. Go see it."

What the viewer is left with, is some heavyhanded attempt( cyrogenics ) to unravel the gordian knot of story line.  What has the viewer learned; that David was having a lucid dream, and he became a murderous schizophrenic- or that he found true love through a programmed dream?  Why did the story need the cyrogenic twist?  Wasnt the belief it might be a dream, or a nightmare- good enough? How can so many talented people- put out such trash?"

In Sixth Sense it was the different coloured door handle, in this it's the titular Vanilla Sky.<br/><br/>I do have one rather obvious question about this movie, and I'm sure I'm not the first to ask it - If David could choose when his real life ended and the dream began, why didn't he pick the night he spent with Cruze before he got into the car with his psycho girlfriend? That way he need never have had the crash, complete with scars. I guess the answer is that it wouldn't have made for a very interesting movie. Also, perhaps if he had done that he would have just got into the car with her again anyway. Who knows.<br/><br/>This is a good movie. It's got too much sex in it, but it does make you think, which doesn't happen enough in films these days.

","This is one of the greatest movies of all time.  But what do you expect when you team up the greatest actor (Tom Cruise) of his generation with one of the greatest storyteller of the last 10 years (Cameron Crowe)?  Furthermore, every actor in this film brings their A-game.  Aside from the top shelf story, it's the actors that enable this film to stand apart from the rest of 2001-2.  Cameron Diaz practically re-invents the desperate woman persona and Penelope Cruz shines as love at its most innocent.  Kurt Russell once again gives such a splendid performance that you forget ""Tango and Cash,"" ""Soldier,"" and ""Overboard.""  He is sensitive yet demanding all at once.  And towards the end of the film, he nails what should have been an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor (or at least a Golden Globe) when he switches roles with Cruise.  Once confident in himself, his life, and his profession, he becomes vulnerable, scared, and angry at what his life might actually be.  Jason Lee stars in perhaps the weakest of roles, however, he gives it his all.  Given some of the movie's cornier lines, he delivers them as if it's Shakespeare In the Park.  He is truly an actor's actor.  And Cruise?  He's brilliant as usual.******* POSSIBLE SPOILER********** His performance reminds me of something Roger Ebert said about the film ""Birdy,"" starring Matthew Modine and Nicholas Cage.  He admired the skill of both actors because they had to give up what were then their most important assets as actors: Modine his personality and Cage his...  I can't tell you the latter or I'd give away the movie.  However, if you are familiar with Roger Ebert or ""Birdy"" you may have guessed it.  But the point is, Cruise must give up both of the assets to express the confusion and anger of David Aames.  This film is a treat, and anyone who watches it will surely want to see it 20 more times."

I did not identify with, or care about any of the characters either. Cheap dialog sprinkled with platitudes. It seems like Cameron Crowe was trying to copy 'Total Recall' or something.

Diaz is excellently despicable, while Russell puts on a remarkably composed and competent performance for him.<br/><br/>Great direction, cinematography and location work (an autumn NY looks just great) add a further dimension to a film that could already stand up on plot alone.<br/><br/>I can see why this film created a divergence in opinion.

First off, it was built up like a psychological film, and then suddenly became a fantasy. It took too long to let you know it was a fantasy, and then when you look back on it...it just doesn't seem to fit or flow well.  The whole LE thing seemed STUPID and SILLY...far from thought provoking.  I felt disappointed, gypped, and most of all, unsatisfied.  There was no real conclusion to the film...and oftentimes when a story lacks a conclusion it still leaves you wondering about things.  I didn't wonder anything.  I simply did not care. <br/><br/>
The movie would have been a lot more enjoyable to me had the whole lucid dream BS been in Tom Cruise's mind.  To me, the human mind is far more disturbing and twisted than than the Life Extension thing.<br/><br/>Again, I think this is another movie that people tend to enjoy simply because it's artsy.  Artsy, maybe it was...but that was just because of the cinematography.  The plot was not artistic, like I said, it was silly and full of holes.  <br/><br/>I'd just as soon watch GROUNDHOG DAY.

Basically, I'm not here to praise nor to criticize. ""Vanilla Sky"" is a good movie within reason, it's romance with a twist and going to another point and direction towards the end. What sets it apart is the image. If it cost a lot of money, most of it must have went to the lights department. The guys are amazing. They use the perfect mix of shadows and contrasts and I've rarely seen movies with such photography. Some of the scenes are poetry in motion, others are playing with different surfaces, from leaves to mirrors. The scenes shot at night time have walls reflecting light polls and the bed scenes take good care at playing with the sun and making the faces seem sweet and peaceful. There is a lot of communicating through lights in the movie. The pictures and the rest of the art used as crops are also well chosen. Going right back to the lights, I'd say I've rarely seen such care for every little detail. It really adds a lot to the human side of perceiving the movie as a whole and at the same time, it doesn't take the spotlight.<br/><br/>I mean, it enhances the movie's beauty but it doesn't catch all the attention for itself.

It is haunting and beautiful, and after seeing the original ABRE LOS OJOS, it is clear to me that Crowe did a great job. The original is far less efficient than the remake, and believe it or not, I found VANILLA SKY to be less melodramatic. Also, Penélope Cruz's character is more present and complex in VANILLA SKY. The photography is breathtaking and I loved the music (although it does seem as if Cameron Crowe just threw in all his favorite songs on a CD and pressed 'shuffle'... it's more of a playlist than a real score).<br/><br/>This said, VANILLA SKY is not to be missed. You can question the relevance of making the same movie twice (it's almost a shot by shot copy of the original, and many lines are the same), but to me VANILLA SKY is a great improvement over ABRE LOS OJOS.

","Cameron Crowe finally confirms what's been suspected for quite some time--that's he's a shallow filmmaker with limited range and visual sensibilities--in perhaps the worst film produced by a major studio this past decade. Crowe reunites with star Tom Cruise to deliver a meandering, incomprehensible fantasy (based on Alejandro Amenabar's 1997 film, `Open Your Eyes', unseen by this reviewer) about the price of beauty and it's easy to see the appeal this theme would have to an actor whose career has been defined by his classic good looks. But Cruise has neither the intellectual prowess nor the acting chops to incite any curiosity (indeed, he spends half the time mumbling through a prosthetic mask or grisly facial makeup) and Crowe seems to want to do little else but indulge his star in wild bits of overacting. As usual, Crowe's staid writing style makes everyone else (including Penelope Cruz, Kurt Russell and Cameron Diaz) look bad too: each performer has some bad dialogue to deliver at one point or another and is forced to do it in an embarrassingly earnest way. Crowe, after incomprehensibly trying--and failing--to position himself as Billy Wilder (you can't be Billy Wilder without mingling romance with cynicism and Crowe doesn't appear to have a cynical bone in his body), seems to be setting himself up as a mixture of Alfred Hitchcock and David Lynch, but he's far too pedestrian a filmmaker to capture the essence of either director and the result is a trite, talky, open-ended mess that ends up becoming little more than an ersatz science-fiction mess--albeit with a great soundtrack. You could spend hours trying to decide what it's `about'--and Crowe would love nothing more than to have you do just that--but it would be a waste of time because, other than the vanity thing, it's really about nothing at all. The harsh shock editing is by Joe Hutshing and Mark Livolsi and they destroy the decent, if uninspired, work turned in by cinematographer John Toll. No matter--nothing could overcome Crowe's dull cinematic style anyway."

This movie had about 10 seconds of decency when Penelope Cruz was topless but other than that it isn't worth the rental. Ed Wood movies had more of a story and better acting at times.

The addition to the DVD of a couple of featurettes on the making and publicizing of the film make the feature seem over-hyped and self-congratulatory and should probably have been left off the disc.

","Vanilla Sky is the story of a fantastically privileged ad exec (Tom<br/><br/>Cruise) who finds his life slipping off the tracks while romancing <br/><br/>two women (Penelope Cruz, Cameron Diaz). I liked the way the<br/><br/>film's trailers made you think the movie was going to work out<br/><br/>quite differently than it does. The only problem is that the film<br/><br/>works out in the most preposterous way imaginable.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is allowed to over-act in scene after scene (or maybe<br/><br/>it's just that he's not a very good actor). Penelope Cruz tries to be<br/><br/>cute, but ends up a disappointment (unless, of course, you have a<br/><br/>crush on the actress). However, Cameron Diaz comes up with<br/><br/>another nice performance, and at least you have to give her credit<br/><br/>for booking onto unusual projects. <br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT!!!<br/><br/>There's no question that director Cameron Crowe worked out his<br/><br/>imagery with great care, and that most of our clues to the mystery<br/><br/>of the ad exec's life hinges on those clues. But the film starts off<br/><br/>with one set of rules (Cruise versus the board of his company) and<br/><br/>ends up with another which is quite unexpected (Cruise having<br/><br/>lucid dreams during suspended animation). While the twist might<br/><br/>have worked under different conditions, the audience has no real<br/><br/>reason to believe that the medical technology is nothing but a cruel<br/><br/>hoax. As a result, the twist ending is almost a deus ex machina<br/><br/>finale. It makes sense in a contrived kind of way, but you feel as if<br/><br/>you've been cheated. <br/><br/>Vanilla Sky is a drama founded on cinematic tricks. Some (as in<br/><br/>The Others) work out well; this did not."
"Brogan","10","1","2","12 December 2001"," The talented Mr. Crowe.
","Man oh man.  Leave it to Cameron Crowe.  Last year he directed the most whimsical film which was also one of the best movies ever made, (ALMOST FAMOUS).  Now he's directed one of the most thought provoking films ever made, which could also just as well be one of the best films this year, VANILLA SKY.  This is a film that will have you think about what you just saw and the more you take the film apart, the more meaning there is behind the film.  This isn't the same style of Cameron Crowe who directed the crowd pleasing, JERRY MAGUIRE.  This is more like the nightmare of Jerry Maguire. David Aames (Tom Cruise) ownes 51% of a major magazine publishing company, that he inherited from his father.  The other 49% of the company is owned and runed by the seven board members of the company, which David likes to call ""the Seven Dwarfs.""  He is despised by the members as being another ""rich kid who got daddy's business"" which has David feel that he is the victim of a conspiracy.  But outside of work, David is flirtatious, he is having an affair with a stunning blonde named Julie (Cameron Diaz).  David feels only lust for Julie, no love.  It isn't until David's best friend, Brian Shelby (Jason Lee) introduces David to Sofia Serrano (Penelope Cruz), that David begins to feel different.  David is attracted to Sofia, but he feels different, he is in love with Sofia, not lust.  And this leads David to realize that Sofia is changing his life, and for the first time in his life, from the flirting with Julie and the pressures at work, David feels great.  Julie sees David is attracted to Sofia and is jealous, she feels that David violated her by treating her like a sex object.  While David is at his peak, Julie is at her downfall, which leads to Julie crashing her car off a bridge with her and David in it.      When David wakes up from his coma after several months, he is living his nightmare.  He is being charged for murder, he is incarcerated, he's seeking psychatric help from Dr. Curtis McCabe (Kurt Russell), and the worst thing is that David's face has been disfigured making him from looking handsome to horrifying.  David's worst nightmares are coming true, which causes David to mentally and physically try to bring his life back to the way it was. VANILLA SKY is a remake of the 1997 film OPEN YOUR EYES.  I haven't seen the original version, but for Crowe's version, it's a very stylish and well made thriller.  Crowe uses his skills to make VANILLA SKY similar to his previous films, with the entertaining dialogue, and excellent romantic chemistry.  You would think that at first VANILLA SKY is another retelling of Crowe's previous work JERRY MAGUIRE.  But then it turns into the darkest of nightmares.  Being disfigured, accussed or murder, the fear of not being in love anymore, being alone, and worst of all, being depressed is the darkest of feelings that any human being could feel.  Crowe makes an impressive turn at turning VANILLA SKY from a cute touch romance, to a intense and depressing thriller. The acting is brought out the strongest by it's star Tom Cruise. Unlike the flamboyance of MAGNOLIA, the anger of BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY, and the confused JERRY MAGUIRE, David Aames is in a lot of pain.  Cruise does a outsanding job as the man who is suffering from the car accident and realizes that things can't be the way they were.  I also enjoyed the performance by Kurt Russell, who gives a strong acting performance as the doctor who is looking deep inside Cruise's character to see if he can find the answer causing David's pain.  And the support from Penelope Cruz, Jason Lee, and Cameron Diaz are all also good.  The romantic chemistry between Tom and Penelope is fantastic, you can see how they fell in love with each other in reality.  But it's the Oscar worthy performance by Cruise that helps carry the picture. I was also strongly pleased with the music soundtrack that Crowe and wife Nancy Wilson put together for the film.  I was amazed to hear the little known gem by the Monkees ""Porpoise Song (Theme From Head)"" being played in the movie.  Like HEAD, VANILLA SKY is similar in style by taking the viewer into a trip that is unforgettable.  And other songs by Paul McCartney (doing the title tune), Peter Gabriel, Stereolab, Chemical Brothers, Bob Dylan, and Spiritualized, is a fantastic soundtrack of mixing classic songs from the 60's with the similar style songs of the 21st century. Then finally there is Cameron Crowe's directing.  He has the viewer keep guessing on what is going on while watching the film until the very end.  It isn't until it's over that you do understand what is going on, and are still amazed by the twist.  And Crowe never does make the film boring, it might be weird or confusing, but never silly or boring.  Crowe also manages to take the film from one mood into another mood without any faults. VANILLA SKY is a film that won't please the Tom Cruise fans who would like to see him do more films like TOP GUN and DAYS OF THUNDER.  Nope, sorry folks, that Tom Cruise has hopefully passed on, this is the Tom Cruise like EYES WIDE SHUT and MAGNOLLIA, the one who does a level texture role and not just the hero.  VANILLA SKY also proves that Cameron Crowe doesn't have to do only romantic comedies to show that he's a brilliant filmmaker, he can do thrillers with a stroke of genius.  For those who like film with intelligence and wit, then don't miss VANILLA SKY, one of, if not the best film of the year!  ***** (out of five)"

","This film could have been a masterpiece in my (humble) opinion, if it had ended with the elevator doors opening at the top of the skyscraper. But it did not end there and it became too long, because the moral of the film had already been named and the mystery had been solved. Good acting by Cruise and Cruz. I generally do not like Cruise that much (too much smiley, happy, slick guy) but he was good here. My absolute hero in this film: Jason Lee. HE RULES. Whenever I see him I must laugh. HE IS SO COOL. I guess I always have to think about the Brody character (Mallrats) when I see him.<br/><br/>

","This movie made more sense to me because I had seen the Spanish film, Open Your Eyes, that Vanilla Sky was based on. It followed Open Your Eyes pretty closely. Of course, one major difference was this was set in New York City. Also, I was expecting Tom Cruise to look more disfigured because in the original the Spanish guy's scars were a lot worse.  Penelope Cruz was pretty much the same in this as in the original.   I liked the car crash scene the best because Cameron Diaz really starts to sound crazy during it.  Tom should have just jumped out of the car when it was obvious she was turning psychotic.<br/><br/>
I still can't decide if I like the ending.  I mean, when you think about it, it does make sense.  But, also seems like an easy way out to explain a lot of things that don't make sense, such as Cameron Diaz showing up after she's died.  Is Tom really crazy and seeing things or is Sofia all a figment of his mind? Is it all a dream?<br/><br/>
FINAL VERDICT: If you are a Tom Cruise fan, then you will like this because he is really cute in this role.  The movie is OK, but it is not really a murder mystery, so don't be misled.  I recommend it if you are looking for a movie that is a little sci-fi and different from a lot of films out there. Just remember you have to pay attention throughout to get the ending."

","... it was with a sense of anticipation that i settled in to my seat to see Vanilla Sky. whilst appreciating Cameron Crowe's earlier films for the watchable enterprises that they have been, i had never found myself as being particularly emotionally drawn to them; previous dialogue had a tendency for mawkish sentimentality (almost famous), and occasional over repetition ( jerry macguire). also, in many of his films, the director has a tendency to become bogged down in the semi-autobiographical nature of his works - note the fawning self-appreciation of his younger self in almost famous, or the ridiculous amount of time that kate hudson spends enigmatically staring into the camera!!<br/><br/>it was with a pleasant sense of surprise then, that i found vanilla sky to be one of the most emotionally affecting films that i have seen for a long time. the director manages to accurately convey on screen a real sense of tom cruise and penelope cruz actually falling in love. this is not done with undue sentimentalisation, but through heavy focus on music and its nostalgic qualities, as well as standing back from the viewer, rather than ramming sentiment down their throat. performances are excellent throughout, even from cruise, who manages to downplay his role effectively for the most part. diaz, on the other hand, looks as good as ever on screen (i.e. unbelievably beautiful!!), and puts in a good performance to boot. cruz is warmer and more beguiling than i had anticipated, and as mentioned, her and cruise fall in love extremely convincingly (and we all know why that is)!!<br/><br/>the soundtrack is another absolute highlight of the film and conveys its emotional highs and lows brilliantly. icelandic band sigur ros are the undisputed highlights, and if their song at the films denoument doesn't fill your eyes with tears, then you really need a new record collection.<br/><br/>
this film WILL affect you unless you have never known what it is like to fall in love, in which case, i suggest you trade in your heart of stone for another one. ask cameron crowe to give you a hand."

","I saw the original ""Open Your Eyes"" in summer of 2000 (see my review of that).

Because it was basically a re-shoot in English of an uncommonly good film.<br/><br/>The audience in the screening I just watched was unusually silent. Many people may have been wondering what was going on, trying to work through the plot twists. From the opening scene until very near the end, it's not entirely clear why things are happening, but the final scenes DO wrap it up. You get a very satisfying sense of ""I didn't see that coming, but I like it"".<br/><br/>There is a percentage of people who will simply never get this movie. They will think it's stupid, pointless, long, and boring. Then there are the people who will recognize it for what it is: a brilliant concept, exceptionally scripted, well shot, and this time there's a soundtrack to enjoy.<br/><br/>If you let yourself get immersed in the characters, you may even be surprised at the depth of emotion their fates will evoke.<br/><br/>If your IQ is over 100 (the ""average""), then I predict you will enjoy this movie.

"kfd","3","1","2","25 January 2002"," A very dull movie...
","I thought this was a terrible movie. Clunky script, actors bouncing performances off of each other, sloooow pacing and the obligatory `twist' at the end (for those that last that long). By the time the `explanation' came around I'd long since given up caring about ANY of the characters and whether they were real, unreal, alive, dead, dreaming, conscious or unconscious.<br/><br/>Crowe's too workmanlike a director to be able to invest the movie with any sense of the strange or the surreal. The characters exist in separate vacuums, talking TO each other but failing to connect. Penelope Cruz's performance is a big disappointment. In exactly the same way that Renee Zellweger's `cute' mannerisms eventually grate in `Jerry Maguire', so too do Cruz's `winsome' tics grate here.<br/><br/>Crowe also indulges himself again regarding pop songs on the soundtrack. He's starting to use them to do the work that the script, camera and actors should. The scene with ""Good Vibrations"" is a case in point, the song completely undercuts what is happening up there on the screen.<br/><br/>
If you looking for a movie that REALLY provokes, that truly deals with the nature of whether what you're seeing is real or not, then go see ""Memento"" and/or ""Mulholland Drive""."

","When I go to a party, there are two types of annoying guests. The intellectual eggheads who drone on endlessly, and the babbling motormouth airheads who must keep their lips flapping or they will apparently die of asphyxiation. ""Vanilla Sky"" is like the combination of those two guests. It drones on and on endlessly, and if you actually care to figure out what's going on, it will never let you get a thought in edgewise. Tom Cruise smirks a lot for forty minutes, then gets all confused, just like the audience. Cameron Diaz is hot and she can stalk me any day, but unfortunatly she's gone before we have a chance to know more about her. I don't know what the hell Penolope Cruz was trying to say, but they should have provided subtitles. The movie then turns into a pretentious hodgepodge of philosophy and virtual reality that by this point had me shaking my head. Of course, just like every other ""deep"" movie ever released since ""The Sixth Sense"", it has to have some quirky explanation as to why things were the way they were. Trust me, you'll be so underwhelmed by the secret suprise ending of ""Vanilla Sky"", you won't remember to reveal it anyone.

"The Mad Reviewer","9","1","2","17 January 2002"," Cameron Crowe's tantalizing film sticks with you.
","VANILLA SKY (2001) Rating: 9/10<br/><br/>Before seeing this movie you need to bring your imagination, intellect and your sense of wonder to this film, along with a friend if someone's handy. You will need all four - the latter is critical to talk through your impressions and the film's possibilities over a nice cafe mocha after the show.<br/><br/>It's not another date movie of the kind Hollywood routinely churns out. There's a lot to like about this movie. It demands to be watched ""Closely!"" Open your eyes... (where'd I here that?) Now there's nothing wrong with fun fare of, say Charlie's Angels and Shrek. To all flicks, a purpose. Those are frolicks. This one is more comparable to a philosophical lecture, where the professor insists you learn by immersing yourself in the experience. Each has entertainment value. This one simply demands your full attention to ""get it"".<br/><br/>The movie is very different from what the commercials make it out to be. It turns out to be more of a fantasy film actually. And it is a ""thinking"" film that made me want to talk about afterwards, which is always cool with me. There are also lots of humor and witty dialogue throughout the movie, much more than you would expect from seeing the trailers. Jason Lee seemed to get the bulk of the funny bits (as always), but Tom Cruise gets in his share of memorable zingers, too.<br/><br/>Having said that, I think a lot of what makes this a success in my book are the five great performances by the leads. Tom Cruise is at his charismatic best, and Penelope Cruz is more lovable than in any other movie I've seen her in. The two of them have palpable chemistry, I have no trouble believing that the sparks continued long after Cameron Crowe yelled ""Cut!"" Jason Lee is, not surprisingly, perfectly cast, having mastered the art of playing the smart-ass best friend in Kevin Smith's flicks. The real surprise is Cameron Diaz. I've adored her ever since she first entered that bank in 1994s The Mask. She then proved surprisingly game in There's Something About Mary, and she revealed an edgier side of her acting in Being John Malkovich, but this (for lack of a better term) psycho bitch turn is still quite shocking! I'll never see her as a harmless blonde sweetie ever again! Cruise also does some of his most interesting acting when events spin out of control, showing a much darker side of himself. As in Eyes Wide Shut and Magnolia, I think the fact that we're used to seeing him as such a successful stud makes his breakdown even more affecting.<br/><br/>Behind the camera, Cameron Crowe is as ""on"" as he's never been. With the help of cinematographer John Toll and his wife Nancy Wilson doing the score, he crafts a constantly stimulating succession of sounds and visuals, sometimes to rivetingly surreal effect. Plenty of scenes are still haunting me, from the Times Square opening to the breathtaking finale, through countless other great moments. And what about the soundtrack! A former Rolling Stone writer, Crowe always puts together bitching soundtracks for his movies. Think of the use of ""In Your Eyes"" in Say Anything, of ""Free falling"" in Jerry Maguire, the Seattle grunge in Singles, or the Led Zeppelin tunes in Almost Famous. Now in Vanilla Sky, we can hear such great artists as Radiohead, REM, the Beach Boys, Bob Dylan and Peter Gabriel, all used to near perfection. I mean, some will disagree, but I found the ""Good Vibrations"" music cue just priceless, I had ""Solsbury Hill"" caught in my head for the whole day and even Joan Osborne's ""One of us"" took on creepy undertones!<br/><br/>Vanilla Sky explores some very intriguing territory, which will confuse the hell out of a lot of people, but give it time, there is a point and some sense to make off it all in the end. Some might argue that it's better to leave things unexplained than to tie everything up, but in this particular case, I thought the exposition served its purpose, and as delivered by Noah Taylor (""Tech support!"") and Tilda Swinton, it doesn't feel tedious. And then, the movie reaches a payoff. To reverse one of the film's leitmotiv, since you got more into the sweet early scenes, the sour elements hit even harder, and when you don't expect it no more, ""sweetness follows"" and you leave the theater still on a high, wondering what it is that would make you most happy."
"mattymatt4ever","7","1","2","16 January 2002"," Protracted and somewhat dragging, but overall one overwhelming, truly original motion picture that you won't soon forget
","I was anxious to see this movie, being that I am--and please don't think I'm corny for saying this--a Tom Cruise fan.  I didn't like ALL his movies (didn't care for either of the ""Mission Impossible"" flicks), but he is a real cool actor, and that was made evident ever since his breakthrough role in ""Risky Business.""  Cruise turns in yet another terrific performance. It's a shame, being he is one of the handsomemest men in the universe, that they had to fracture his face throughout most of the film, but I also have to admire him for allowing viewers (especially females) to see him disfigured, proving (like in ""Born on the 4th of July"") that he is not just a glamour guy, just a pretty face, that he is up to taking risks in the roles he chooses.<br/><br/>If you've seen the previews, you've seen the first thirty minutes.  And for that, I'm glad!  Because so many previews nowadays practically give away the film.  Anyone who has seen the previews for ""Cast Away"" knows that's true. Though it was a great movie, we sat there for three hours knowing that Tom Hanks would finally survive and return to civilization in one piece.  I won't give away what happens after Cruise gets into the car accident with Cameron Diaz, because the outcome is utterly unpredictable.  Cameron Crowe surprises you with plot twist after plot twist, making you think more and more.  After leaving the theater, I had a totally different view of life. All sorts of questions came into mind.  All those magical ""what if"" questions.  What if things aren't what they seem?  Though the outcome is pure fantasy--created with great imagination--it still makes you ponder what lies in the future.  Maybe this COULD happen.<br/><br/>Jason Lee is a scene-stealer, as Cruise's best friend.  I am a great admirer of Jason, but after cringing at his disastrous role in ""Heartbreakers"" I was hoping he could stay in the independent circuit, and not even dream of co-starring in another big-budget motion picture.  But in this movie he plays the role he was born to play--what he's truly good at.  Playing the wise-cracking, intellectual, smart-aleck, know-it-all best friend.  The kind of role that put him on the map in such films as ""Mallrats"" and ""Chasing Amy.""  He is hilarious and brings great comic relief to this moderately depressing story.  So I hope to see him in more movies, small- or big-budget--just be careful how they cast you, Jason.<br/><br/>
As for Penelope Cruz--I have to admit, I'm tired of seeing her on screen. I used to think she was attractive, but now I think she looks like a bird. But that's not my main reason for disliking her in this film.  In fact, I didn't mind her (small) role in ""Blow.""  I guess it's because her role was only semi-serious, playing a sex-obsessed cokehead.  In ""Vanilla Sky"" she plays a serious role that seems to have been written for an American, or someone with good control of the English language.  Here, she's struggling through her lines left and right, and the dialogue just doesn't sound convincing coming from her mouth.  Therefore, it's hard for her to convey any true emotion.  I've never seen any of her Spanish films, but she might've acted well in them, being she has great control of her native language.  So I'm not just being cruel.  I'm sorry, but I just find her accent to be annoying and distracting.<br/><br/>At two hours and thirty minutes, the movie is too long for its own good and it does drag at times--a few scenes really didn't seem necessary and could've easily ended up on the cutting room floor.  But I guess Cameron Crowe is one of those directors who prefers to stretch out the running time, making sure not a single element is left out.  ""Jerry Maguire"" (also directed by Crowe) was also too long for its own good.  However, I'm still recommending this film because of the mere fact that it's like nothing you've ever seen.  It's the kind of film you won't soon forget and will definitely leave a lasting impact.<br/><br/>My score:  7 (out of 10)"
"bedazzle","7","1","2","11 January 2002"," patronizing
","Spoilers, interpretation:<br/><br/>I really liked this movie until the patronizing ending. The audience is treated like morons. The movie ends, and then for some reason the makers feel the need to tack on an extra forty-five minutes to explain the movie. Maybe they thought it'd make more money if it was dumbed down a bit? Possibly, but I think the biggest motivating factor was the need for a more romanticized ending. You can't very well let the audience leave in a gloomy mood because they think David will remain in his nightmare forever, can you?<br/><br/>
I can tell you how to fix this movie: just don't add any unnecessary emotionalism. Don't lie to the audience and pretend that this a happy movie. To do this, there is a simple solution: end the movie when David takes his psychologist to L.E. Go all the way through with the little movie presentation, and then have the psychologist ask David once again, ""Did you sign something with these people?"" David looks on with a blank/confused/terrorized face, and the movie ends. This is the ideal ending because at this point, everything in the movie is explained. Instead we get forty-five minutes of re-explanation, patronization.<br/><br/>Yet there are two new sub-themes added in the extra time. They are new, unnecessary, and done for the sake of drama, melodrama really. First, David kills himself. There is absolutely no reason for this. He has a malady that cannot be fixed, therefore he could just as easily have himself frozen without the suicide. David's death is contrived pathos. It also works to consummate his relationship with Sofia. Aww, how nice, she still loves him, ""she knew him better than anyone else"" even though she only saw him once - more pathos. Second, there is the ending in which David decides that real life is better than dream, continuing along in that naive Matrixesque vein. Again, this is just pointless melodrama because tragedies don't sell. It's dishonest and denial and patronizing , but ""the answer to 99 of 100 questions is money.""<br/><br/>Two flagrant examples of patronization. First, the L.E. lady tells David that he can be forever in a dream and David asks, ""Couldn't it be a nightmare?"" Moments later he reaches an epiphany and shouts ""This is a nightmare!"" Second, standing on the roof, David asks, ""I set up this whole scenario didn't I?"" ""Yes,"" the dream technician replies, ""you had to face your fear of heights."" These are examples of stating the obvious, spelling it out for you, treating you like children, that the ending is wrought with.<br/><br/>
Technical problems. In cryonization, the brain is dead. Hence, no dreams are possible. A coma would have been the rational choice. Plus it would have added interest to have the entire movie last one moment (""You can change your life in a moment"") than 150 years; not to mention the fact that it would have made Sofia's ""Hello David"" upon awakening realistic. Also, there is the problem that by definition, a lucid dream is one that the dreamer is aware he is having. The movie makes it seem that the entire dream is lucid, while only the ending, after he returns to L.E. is.<br/><br/>During the movie I was planning on giving it a 9, but after that ending I lowered my rating to a 7. The fact that I'm more of an interpreter than a reviewer probably plays a role."
"unigolyn","10","1","2","10 January 2002"," Philip K. Dick meets The Game
","First of all, to people who say the original was better, and ask why the movie was made: Excuse me, but it is near impossible to enjoy a movie to its full extent if you are reading subtitles. It distracts and it detracts, both from the narrative and, most of all, the performances. This movie was made because most people in the world who would see such movies speak english (not a native speaker myself, but everyone with half a brain learns english nowadays). Kurosawa's films are great, but every time I watch them I wish I could understand Japanese. Enter the remake. And by god, for once a remake is good (painful memories of that horrible botching of Besson's La Femme Nikita). I haven't seen the original, but suffice it to say that I enjoyed this movie thoroughly. Negative comments about Tom Cruise's acting cannot be anything other than some sort of personal hangup with the actor, who does exemplary work in Vanilla Sky. Penelope Cruz and Cameron Diaz both shine, especially Cruz, the scene at the wake was pure perfection. Jason Lee fit his character, and his acting was solid (although I think I'm forever cursed to think of him as Brodie, but that's my problem).  The direction was superb, most people would have copied David Fincher here, but Crowe has his own vision, and shows us a movie which keeps lulling into a french romantic drama, then bolting into a sort of David Lynch on speed. Those who claim the ending is not believable... watch documentaries or something. Out of all the wild ideas the film industry, or more precisely, the FICTION industry has produced, this is by far one of the more believable. It had that nice Philip K. Dick sort of feel to it, something which many sci-fi movies aspire to, but few succeed. Perhaps it IS a sort of version of We Can Remember It For You Wholesale, based more firmly in reality, with less shooting than Total Recall. Nonetheless, if you find this movie to be boring, perhaps you should be paying more attention. The Fugitive this is not. But is it good? By god yes."

David Aames whole world turns around after meeting Sofia. Yes, love at first sight. He is mesmerized. That is all he is left with when he dies. All he has is the mystique of Sofia and that one night. You know, when you have that date that just goes wonderfully  and the whole sky opens up and you are on top of the world. That feeling you had. Maybe you are married now to that person. That first time feeling is gone because the mystery is gone. Well all David Aames had was the feeling and hope of that one encounter. The rest is his Lucid Dream with her..and something goes terribly wrong..in his Lucid Dream.<br/><br/>Some of the reviews scoff at the Lucid Dream/Cryogenics theory. First, it's a movie. Tell me The Sixth Sense and Total Recall aren't a bit of a stretch. But best explained by a line from the movie itself..""they laughed at Jules Verne too""<br/><br/>Cameron Crowe is the master at creating feeling. That good feeling of mystique.

","This movie rocked my world!<br/><br/>I thought Almost Famous was going to be Cameron Crowe's pinnacle. Vanilla Sky exceeded it and then some.<br/><br/>Kevin Smith said he liked it but felt it was just an ""artsy"" Total Recall. Even Mr. Smith missed the point of this movie. This movie is all feel folks.<br/><br/>
Cameron Crowe is the only director that can instill a feeling into a movie that stays with you. To transcend feeling as an analogy on how life should feel. He is simply amazing.<br/><br/>Some opinionist on here say this is nothing more than a sixth sense rip-off much like Kevin Smith stated. While The Sixth Sense had its one twist, I was not compelled to watch it over and over. The Sixth Senses' wad was shot the first time around and now the film has fallen into oblivion.<br/><br/>
Vanilla Sky with its feel will leave you wanting to see it again and again so you can feel the budding love at first sight between Cruise and Cruz. The tragedy of Cruise afterwards and the music that Mr. Crowe has chosen to drive all of it into you.<br/><br/>This movie is not as difficult to follow as some would let on. They simply do not get anything beyond Independence Day, Rambo or American Pie. The first part is real and the second is a dream that goes wrong. I will not give up much more than that. Once you understand the movie then see it again and marvel at the brilliance that is Cameron Crowe. There is so much I caught the second time around and I imagine I will the third and ... This movie is thrilling, tragic, sexy, endearing, sweet and of course..has some great dialogue.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars ...no 6 out of 5...open your eyes!"

People actually walked out of the screening I attended.  I'll admit it's challenging compared to most movies, but most producers know people have zero attention span and this is why their movies are filled with wall to wall explosions or poop jokes.<br/><br/>""Vanilla Sky"" wasn't as good as I wanted it to be, but it's still a fairly good movie as long as you're patient with it.  Everyone in it does a great job with their characters, and Cameron Crowe directs it in a very un-Cameron Crowe way.  I can see why some people would throw their hands up in the air with the ending because it does seem a little loopy if I think about it. Still, I'm going to give it credit as the only movie I ever seen in which the film's true genre isn't revealed until the last 20 minutes of the story."

To me everything was completely resolved (some reviewers felt it was OVER-EXPLAINED, but I didn't mind it because it certainly helped ME understand it).<br/><br/><br/><br/>The thing is, the Life Extension and Lucid Dreams mumbo jumbo were simply vehicles for the writer to express his central ideas.  That of Consequence. That the ""little things are the big things.""  The tiniest decision we make (getting in the car) can have a profound impact on our future.  That may sound bleak, but at the same time it is enveloped by the other, this one positive, idea that ""every minute of your life is a chance to turn things around.""  The film was able to show these ideas very powerfully, to great effect.<br/><br/>When, at the end of the film, it mentioned ""that one night when true love was a possibility"" and then showed David (Cruise) hesitate and eventually get into Julie's (Diaz) car...it was extremely sad.<br/><br/>Another idea repeated in the film was the question ""what is happiness to you?""  Simple question, but extremely difficult to answer.  And if one can't answer it, how can he be happy?<br/><br/>It seems like many recent films have been questioning our concept of reality - Being John Malkovich, Fight Club, The Matrix, Vanilla Sky, Memento (tangentially).<br/><br/>Vanilla Sky is a thought provoking, discussion initiating film, with a powerful message.

"rpc90","10","1","2","5 January 2002"," Into his own...
","Cameron Crowe has solidified, in my mind, his work as a real artist. Before this movie, I wasn't too impressed with his crowd-pleasing, popcorn flicks. But this was a real work of art, glazed with some pop-culture, but still maintains its artistry. It's nice to see people get up and leave the theater because they were expecting something simple and ordinary. Yeah, go see Deuce Bigalow or whatever. Leave the good movies to us. So anyway, this ranks up there with David Lynch's Mullholland Drive, and is (hopefully) indicative of where the film industry is going. I like films that bring up philosophical questions, show various interpretations of identity and delve into that ambiguous postmodern paradigm. If you want a movie that makes you think, challenges you and continues to entertain you days after you watch it, open your mind and watch this film.

","The movie is definitely worth watching. I'm not sure why the movie has gotten such a love it/hate it reputation, but I definitely loved it. Tom Cruise is a great actor. I wish he'd do more of these dramatic kind of roles because he can definitely act. Cameron Diaz gives a great performance and steals the show from Penelope Cruz who gives a solid performance, but wasn't as impressive as Diaz. Jason Lee plays Jason Lee, which is always fun, but like Steve Buscemi's trade-mark witticism from the 90s, Lee's schtick is getting just a little tiresome, in my opinion. Kurt Russell, who I'm a big fan of, has a good supporting role in the film.<br/><br/>There was a lot of eye candy as far as the visuals. I loved the scene at the club. I think Cruise did some of his best acting in this sequence. Rex Reed said there was some unintentional laughter in the film, but who was to say it's unintentional? I laughed at several points in the film, but that only made me enjoy it more. What he calls unintentional, I call ""dark comedy"". I also enjoyed the diverse soundtrack.<br/><br/>I would recommend seeing the film on a big screen, but one thing about the film for those waiting to see it on video or DVD. This is a movie you got to sit down and pay attention to. If you're one of those people that likes to get up and do the dishes or fix the room or talk during the movie, you're NOT going to follow it AND thus you're probably not going to like it."

I didn't care for Almost Famous, but I did like Jerry Maguire; I'm not the world's largest Tom Cruise fan, but I respect his acting ability (i.e., he can act) and he has taken risks (Magnolia, Eyes Wide Shut, Vanilla Sky, etc.) even if nothing could destroy his career at this point in time. now, on to the SPOILERS:<br/><br/>The ending: I have heard several comments stating that it was insulting how they spoon-fed us information at the end; while it's true, it would have been better if it had been ended sooner, but what did they actually tell us? Think about it: the voice saying Open Your Eyes at the end; didn't it sound an awful lot like Penelope Cruz's voice? Is it possible that after he passed out on the pavement, the movie from there on in was a dream not from LE, but from being drunk and passed out on the pavement? Or maybe, they sent him back into the dream without his consent. Or, maybe it was just what it seemed: it was an LE employee's voice and not Penelope Cruz's. or--just possibly--The entire movie was a dream and he'd never even met Penelope Cruz's character, but was still with Cameron Diaz (sorry I can't use the characters name's, but I can't remember them right now and I don't feel like going back to get them.) DO NOT take anything at face value; also, was it just me, or was the color green a theme? they crashed through a green railing, there was green in practically every shot of the opening dream, the lasers at the night club were green and blue, and I got too involved in the story to notice other appearances, but I'm pretty sure they were there.<br/><br/>END OF SPOILERS<br/><br/>I think I'm probably going to have to see this movie about 15 more times to get all the themes and meanings in this movie.

But it appears that all of those dopey, crappy movies have destroyed the brain cells of almost every critic. They called the film ""self-indulgent."" Well, if Vanilla Sky is self-indulgent and ""Pearl Harbor"" isn't, then we need a new dictionary. They called it ""confusing."" Just because a film causes you think for about ten minutes after seeing it, it's confusing?<br/><br/>The film is generating discussion and that's what it's supposed to do. In this post-Survivor world, we need some serious antidote to get that quasi-reality our of our systems. What's big deal if it involves delving into David Aames sub-conscious?

If you think that a movie should spoon feed the surprises and show it's colors with big broad strokes (maybe a huge arrow saying, ""Here's the point!"") then this movie may frustrate you.<br/><br/>Vanilla Sky requires that you be willing to make a leap of faith - that you simply receive the story in expectation of a resolution.  If you can do this, this film will reward your patience as very few films have.  This is not ""cinema."" It is a mystery.  If the critics feel it doesn't live up to it's Spanish-language predecessor, Boo Hoo Hoo.<br/><br/>I'm recommending this movie.  Don't read the reviews.

Cruise's random yells and smiles are eerily similar to those he displayed in ""Jerry McGuire"", while Crowe seems stuck on his 'Almost Famous' rock music trip, as 'Vanilla Sky's name-stuffed soundtrack adds nothing to the film (other than marketing value of course). Bob Dylan, Jeff Buckley, R.E.M., Radiohead, and Sigur Ros all make appearances in awkward places.

""Vanilla Sky"" reminds a little of the lesser known ""The Thirteenth Floor"" in the idea of distinguishing what is real and was it unreal.  Cameron Crowe took a chance on directing a movie that crosses several different genres and it has paid off.  Tom Cruise is excellent as the facially-deformed David Aames. Kurt Russell did well as Dave's psychoanalyst.  Jason Lee made a surprising performance as Dave's best friend.  The best performance in the entire movie IMHO is Penelope Cruz as Sofia (she did well in certain serious and certain funny moments).  Cameron Diaz was great as the sweet-covered but sour-centered Julie.  Overall, this is one of the best multi-genre movies ever made and one of my all-time favorites.<br/><br/>10 out of 10.

Some critic's have been knocking Crowe's use of music in the film, saying it distracts or disrupts the narrative flow. These people are what I like to call ""wrong.""  Crowe has infused warmth and heart into this story, and the music is part of the compass the film gives you.  You feel for these characters so much.  It is genuinely chilling, thrilling and heart-rending throughout the story's unfolding."
"thevirus-3","10","1","2","16 December 2001"," The Best Movie of 2001?
","I went into Vanilla Sky knowing only that the man who directed my favorite movie of last year (almost famous), a super star if there ever was one, and a fantastic supporting cast had come together to create  remake of a spanish film I had never seen (Abre Los Ojos). Well, Cameron Crowe is two for two. He has successfully created my favorite film of 2001. This movie just clicks... I can't really explain it. On a technical level, it was fantastic. The production design, Camera direction, music, acting... it was all superb. Tom Cruise is AMAZING as David Aames, a devil-may-care heir to a publishing empire living in the pseudo-shadow of his father. Penelope Cruz, Cameron Diaz, and my fave Jason Lee all pull fantastic performences out of the air. I can't even really put how I feel about this movie into words. Just go see it. Even if you don't like it (like the people sitting next to me), at least you'll have seen the best crafted film of the year."
"djbell","4","1","2","15 December 2001"," I'm the guy that usually loves these movies, but...
","This movie got a received of gushing and a lot of hate-comments, but I found myself somewhere in between.<br/><br/>The characters and dialog were very entertaining, but not clever; which is only bad because it tried to be.  The movie tried to present itself as a surreal, magical view on...whatever, but goes on too long to be fun when its mysteries are revealed.  By the time the story starts explaining itself, the viewer has already imagined many more interesting finales, thus neutering the wonder.<br/><br/>Leave it to my fellow New Yorkers' extensive groaning on the way out of the theater to fund the above research.  But back to the positive stuff- good acting, great characters, neat concept; and as an added bonus, bless the editors for not tastelessly tearing out images of the World Trade Towers like every other movie.<br/><br/>Now, if only I got to write the last 40 minutes, it would have been perfect!"
"okreallycool","10","1","2","16 December 2001"," Saw it blind
","I messed up and deleted my original review and am now too tired to write. Therefore, in summary I have prepared this:<br/><br/>How it looks: Visually stunning, I will see somthing new everytime I see it. Expects more from the viewer. I need to be challenged, that's a good thing.<br/><br/>How it sounds: Awesome, I couldn't imagine a better soundtrack. Nice job, Cameron. Mondo '77, can't stop playing it, sweet.<br/><br/>How it's played: Cruise and Cruz, excellent. Diaz, won me over as Mary. Jason, you are not a sidekick, nor did you act like one, good job. Goofy guy with a name I don't remember, but are essential to the story, well played as the weird guy who's important in the end. Finally, Kurt Russel, just watched StarGate again, DO MORE DRAMA, surprisingly you can pull it off, excelent work all of you.<br/><br/>Overall: An original remake? Confused? Why not? With all the stuff happening nowadays, a little escape to the cinema to see some more escapage (new word, use it), go for it. You will not be dissapointed. As long as Cameron Crowe continues to make films such as Vanilla Sky, his status as a legendary film director/writer will not be ignored."

You know sometimes you see a film that is so bad that you become embarrassed to watch, because you know that your smarter, better self is dissapointed in what your doing? This is the kind of film.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise, well, after seeing him reinvent himself and go for interesting roles (Eyes Wide Shut, Magnolia), he has now gone back to formula, playing shallow yuppie, spoiled upper class, Hollywood bird magnet brat (himself?) and obviously this is the intention, no fault of the 'Cruiser', its Cameron Crowes' (writer/ director) for having such a bland view on relationships and the even more irritating Penolope Cruz, whom you want to place faeces on her head and smack more than you'd like to make love to.<br/><br/>The love affair between the two, the 'chemistry', is like a really, really disturbing horror film, that can take a while for the after effects to heal and natural, healthy sleep to reinhabit itself and overcome the trauma. It is so unremmitingly shallow (like episode of Freinds' without the canned laughter) and makes a shambles of superior (I'm talking 'God Like' proportions) remake Open Your Eyes that approached its themes with more depth and panache (don't they always).<br/><br/>For 'cake and wine' fanatics and fans of the 'pyjama with popcorn party' only, and for them they are bound to say, 'wow, wasn't that deep? good but a bit weird at the end, don't you think? but what does it all mean? did he really do this?' e.t.c.

In the end, I was wishing for Cameron Diaz (the only good thing in it) to drive the entire cast and crew over the bridge.

If you are looking for a 'mind bending' film that knows what it is doing, rent something like ""BRAZIL.""  Vanilla Sky is a travesty in the worst of all senses.  It is a pseudo art film, so disjointed, it is barely coherent. As for the idea of the film...interesting to a point-but remember that is only an idea.  An idea should not carry an entire film-thus I can spew out words such as: gimmicky and pretentious. As for the pop culture references, does the word subtly mean anything? What was the point Cameron Crowe was trying to make?  That we live in a world over run by products, or products over rule us or products over rule our main character.  That nonsense was completely extraneous to the barely visible story. As for the ending...OH MY GOD!!!  Here's an idea: lets make a film that is incomprehensible and pass it off as a thinking film.  Nothing in this film has to though about-it doesn't cohere to anything.  The ending sums up the entire barrage of sequences that make up 3/4 of the film.  So what is there to think about?  It is right there.  This is just another way to treat idiotic audience members.  Of course I have no problem with people liking even the most awful of movies, but when people can't decipher what is a masterpiece from just another movie, that is a problem.  This picture was a master of manipulation. I don't think I will ever forget this film.  It has a special place in my heart...and it is crushing the life out of me."

This movie is so full of crap, it actually makes me angry just thinking about it. Who knows what the hell it's meant to be about?

Movie also takes place in New York, what is totally irrelevant to the plot or to the message of the film.<br/><br/>It is obvious that this movie was built only in purpose of money making, because there are no new scenes or anything that is different to the original picture.

And most of the time, the film apparently shows the flashbacks in random order, considering we see a disfigured face, then a normal face, and back again. Show them in order, for crying out loud. And why does the entire face need to be covered, when in fact, it only looks bad on one side? The movie, as it is, is confusing enough. I enjoyed Jason Lee's scenes, but they're not enough to recommend the entire movie. Not even close. After David falls to the ground, the film should have just ended. There is no need for a pointless movie like this to be so god damn long. When I saw Julie in Sofia's body (Julia actually killed herself), I knew the movie was going on longer than it needed to.

I'm not sure Cameron Crowe is the guy to adapt this strange Spanish movie. I think it would be more compelling to have more of this movie to be dreamlike in a visually surreal way. Cameron Crowe is not a visual director. The empty streets of New York are an interesting way to start but he needs to do more. It is a pretty interesting confusing movie but something keeps bugging me about it. My take on the ending is coma but it could mean so many things."

","Vanilla Sky is what happens when a great director wins an award, gets surrounded by Yes men, and gets the opportunity to have full reign of his dream project. This has vanity project written all over it. It's just gobbledygook. I understand why people hate this movie. Cameron Crowe really didn't care if this movie polarized his audience, and it astoundingly did so. But, the people that liked it, to my estimation, either looked into it too deeply, understood it's intentions or just laughed at how utterly incomprehensible it was. I gave it a chance, and I was oddly entertained by it. At times I couldn't believe what I was watching, but I had to keep going. I feel aggravated, but accomplished for having watched it. Cameron Crowe has unfortunately never made a decent movie again after this. You can see that it's his tipping point. Pretension and sticky saccharine gloop practically are pouring out of the seams, about to burst. I'd like to get a Life Extension, and dream that Cameron Crowe still makes good movies like Almost Famous."

","The movie presents a very interesting story, although it's not an original one. Furthermore I really like how the movie marries its distanced genres of romance and science fiction. The movie did a very great job in shifting the focus from the romance side, bit by bit moving it until the grand revelation of the science fiction side. Both of the genres were done quite powerfully. The romance side had its story strong enough with the conflicts coming in and out. The science fiction side feels rather unlikely at first but then gained its significance more and more over time. The acting work is a great overall job. Tom Cruise did his character nicely although his usual grin really bores people down. Cameron Diaz did her part well, having her character suddenly reappearing after the middle point. Penelope Cruz adds her accent very nicely to the romantic side of the story. Having big names like Kurt Russell, Tilda Swinton and Michael Shannon's kind of a cameo, in supporting roles really adds to the movie as a whole."

Who knows in the 21st century itself the lucid dream could become a reality for citizens of Earth. The movie is all about love, the hunger for power and how most people are living in a virtual reality. Very few know the difference between the real world and the illusion that exists.The movie can be described as an arty but if you don't subscribe to usual Hollywood clichés, then this one would stretch your imagination.<br/><br/>I especially like the part of car crash, I thought the actors did a really good role because there was not much substance in it, she did not win any awards for it though.

"mkham6","9","1","3","30 March 2013"," Deep haunting moving examination of Reality, Illusion, Truth and Dreams
","I'm frankly mystified at the powerful negative reactions this movie arouses- I think it is one of the best science fiction and meaning of life movies ever! Reviewers raved about the sterile AI but pretty much ignored this gem, which packs a deep emotional impact, especially to those who lived through the 60's (Crowe has woven in 60's-70's photos and music with the consummate skill of a Madison Ave wizard), but the simple and incredibly potent dilemma is this: If you have the ability to live in a seamless fantasy world of illusion... or the shattered reality of your broken dreams.... which would you choose? It embodies the literate moral quandary that all great sci-fi has, and truth be told- probably won't remain fiction for 70 years. At some point they will develop neural interfaces that allow people to be jacked into computers and experience artificial ""life""- at first it will be sex fantasies, of course. But eventually, simulations will get better and better till people can choose to live their very lives in the Matrix (to, ah, coin a phrase). If drug addiction is bad now, imagine how far people would drop out with such an option.<br/><br/>VS is sometimes melodramatic and visually garish, but one must realize- that FITS- it is ALL a creation of Cruise's mind, and he is choosing cloud colors from Monet's paintings and theatrical drama, just as we do in our dreams. What is the reality of this movie? Is it all a coma-induced dream, or is he really living the Lucid Dreams of the cryogenic company he signed up with. Huge themes of immortality, eternal youth, true love, man's penchant for destruction and psychological sabotage jockey around for position- people that panned this movie are soulless nerds with no sense of curiosity about any of this. Life is a mystery and this ventures to ask some Big Questions.<br/><br/>Another classic theme is someone who has it all (Cruise inherits an empire), loses it all, them gains it all back- so there's a lot of pathos there, letting Tommy play the gamut from smug radiant winner to broken loser- he can be a great actor when pushed (Born on the 4th of July) and he's far better here than most of his roles.<br/><br/>Cameron Diaz is simply terrifying here- frankly her unhinged wild lustiness always gave me the creeps- this is exactly what I imagined her capable of- an obsessed deranged Fatal Atraction ex, and her reappearances are as shocking as the best horror flicks. Penelope Cruz is a little too Betty Boop cute and adorable here, though Tom liked her enough to do a corporate merger (they should have picked a 3rd spelling of their name- Crooz?), while Jason Lee plays the angry aggressive friend a little too broadly.<br/><br/>If you've never seen it, DO. It is a preview of our future."
"Manal1987","8","1","3","16 January 2013"," Wonderful! Just keep Cruise out of the way
","One of the inexplicably underrated movies. Based on the ratings and reviews, I started watching Vanilla Sky reluctantly knowing that I would definitely be disappointed. However, and to my surprise, I was totally awestruck by the smart, dreamy story, the brilliant direction, and the out-of-this-world cinematography.<br/><br/>The only letdown though (and the reason behind the two missing stars in the rating) is Tom Cruise's stagy performance. He completely missed out on the soul of the character he is impersonating and turned it into a phony. I understand that David Aames is supposed to be shallow and irresponsible and that the movie is his journey towards self-realization and maturity. The point is that Cruise's overtly theatrical performance and overacting (to stress the character's clumsiness) detached me and kept reminding me that I'm watching a movie.<br/><br/>Still I have to watch the allegedly superior Spanish original (Abre Los Ojos) to make a better judgment, but I think Cameron Crowe did a wonderful job adapting this one."

One is happy and carefree life of young, beautiful and successful, other one is nightmare of nightmares, which in comparison with first one becomes even more tough. The third one, the ending - is nothing to be expected and it leaves the viewer in total harmony, while the movie itself is quite disturbing. <br/><br/>Acting is brilliant, you can clearly see emotions and live through them through out the movie. <br/><br/>The last but not least is that words and phrases in the movie, especially in the ending are so finely sharped that you can use them to live a life worth living.<br/><br/>High recommendation, probably for watching alone or in a small quiet company."

It's not because you didn't get the plot it's just that it looks like the plot was written by a crazy man who didn't know the difference between reality and dreams.<br/><br/>This movie starts out OK but gets more and more twisted the longer you watch it. This constant changing between reality and dream doesn't function very well when you never know which is what and it constantly changes so the reality isn't so real anymore. The whole concept of this plot is so far fetched that an ordinary mind can never buy it. Instead it makes you feel a little crazy when figuring out what it's about.<br/><br/>It's not just the plot thats wrong but it's incredibly boring too. I fell asleep twice before I could finish it. It is 136 minuets but should be around 90 minuets since there's nothing important happening except a few things. I'm not saying I can't handle long movies because most of my favorites are 2-3 hours.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is not bad. Tom Cruise acts very well specially in the motional scenes. But it needs a bit more than a good acting to make this movie worth watching.<br/><br/>Overall this is the worst movie I've ever seen. A lot of people I know fully agree with that statement. I find it strange to see that this movie is not on the bottom 250. Maybe it's just that the people around me have different opinions than most other people.

I've watched both movies; the original ""Abre Los Ojos"" was very good, but it has an entirely different feel and isn't as dynamic as Cameron Crowe's remake which makes better use of soundtrack. The concept for me back in 2001 was innovative and still now I find the film entertaining. Everyone is welcome to their opinions but please let's have some honesty.

"osakar","Null","1","3","31 January 2012"," Outstanding
","Probably one of the most criminally underrated films of all time, Vanilla Sky is beyond any doubt a great movie, and a truly original exploration of life, death, love, dreams and reality. Much like the American version of ""The Office"", it is that rare creation that steps out of the shadow of its predecessor and takes on a life all its own. This is largely thanks to writer / director Cameron Crowe, who has managed to pull off something very unlikely – a remake that is superior to the original.<br/><br/>Based on the cult film Abre Los Ojos by Alejandro Amenábar, ""Sky"" has little in common with the lackluster carbon copies Hollywood usually churns out when remaking foreign movies. It is obvious that a lot of care went into the making of ""Sky"", and my impression is that Crowe found true inspiration in Amenábar's movie and strongly wanted to tell the story in his own words. While Crowe doesn't stray very far from the source material, to the point of some scenes being almost identical to those of the original, he has added a myriad of his own creative influences and personal touches, creating a true cinematic experience that is captivating and memorable in its own right. Despite the similarities, ""Sky"" stands on its own.<br/><br/>The film's most striking quality is the use of music and sound, both of which are superb. Crowe has picked out a selection of popular tracks of various genres and found unexpected, yet pitch-perfect, moments to unleash them. Key scenes will make you listen to songs by Joan Osbourne, Underworld, Todd Rundgren, The Beach Boys, Freur and Sigur Rós in a whole new way. And Radiohead has seldom sounded better than in the opening scenes. This is one of those films where, if nothing else, the soundtrack alone would make the whole production worthwhile. The music and sound create a distinct and difficult-to-explain atmosphere, one that is unique to this film. You have to see it to understand.<br/><br/>The casting is nothing short of genius. In four of the five main parts, it seems like every actor was born for their role. Cruise as the man who has it all, but falls victim to his own vain selfishness. Lee as his best friend, charming but maybe not who he appears to be. Russell as the humble father figure. And Diaz, who shows a whole new side of herself and stands for some of the film's more disturbing moments. The weak link is Cruz as the love interest. Her flawlessness becomes overbearing at times, although this could have more to do with how her character is written than the actress herself.<br/><br/>It is a film with a twist ending, but it doesn't rely on this twist to work. In fact, knowing the twist beforehand, or re-watching the film knowing how it will end, in no way takes away from the experience. This is because the film is so solidly constructed, so well acted, and set to such an incredible soundtrack. The final elevator scenes have, at least for me, lost none of their beauty, even though I know the script almost word for word and there are no surprises left.<br/><br/>Vanilla Sky is romantic and sad, sometimes horrifying and other times beautiful. It is easily a career high-point for all involved. A must-see."

"jelnoh","7","1","3","1 May 2011"," An interesting film filled with plot twists, worth watching twice...
","Cameron Crowe's Vanilla Sky tells the story of David Aames played by Tom Cruise and his relationship with two women Sofia Serrano played by Penelope Cruz and Julie Gianni played by Cameron Diaz. David is a man who basically has it all, rich, good looking and fortunate. He has everything or believes he can have it. The film itself can be confusing as the plot unfolds in a backward manner that makes it hard to grasp exactly what is going on. Often you might find yourself thinking did you see that right or thinking something as a fact when it was not what it seemed.<br/><br/>The theme of the film Vanilla Sky is dreams and the minds interpretation of reality. David has trouble distinguishing between the two states. His dreams seem real to him, an example is when he is driving through New York and he is the only person around. There is no other cars on the road, no people walking he is alone. This is also a symbolic reference to his life and how he feels like he is alone. The film scene transitions also make you feel like a dream. The scenes cut to black then to another entirely different time or place.<br/><br/>David is a rich guy who inherited the family business after his parents were killed in a car crash. He is carrying on a relationship with Julie however this is more of a one sided relationship, she cares for David but is only a sex partner to him. A short time later David meets Sofia at a party. Sofia is at the party as the date of one of David's friends Brian played by Jason Lee but ends up spending more time with David than Brian. David then takes Sofia home and they seem to have a good time and like each other but do not sleep together. Upon leaving Sofia's home David is somehow confronted by Julie who is upset but talks David into going for a drive in her car.<br/><br/>From here the movie takes a turn in some surprise directions and becomes harder to follow. Julie and David argue about their relationship, eventually Julie drives her car off a bridge killing herself and results in plastic surgery for David on his face and arm. The accident leaves David disfigured or wearing a facial prosthetic for much of the remaining movie.<br/><br/>From this point in the movie the surprises and twists happen a mile a minute. David is accused of murder and spends a great deal of time talking to a psychiatrist played by Kurt Russell. As the plot winds backwards much the same way the film Memento does you can tell something is not as it seems David sees many times a dog which was frozen and brought back to life. This leads to the discovery that he did the same thing. David had visited a corporation that uses computers and a deep freeze technique to give people dreams and prolong their lives indefinitely. During much of the movie David is actually having a nightmare. The twist and realization at the end of the movie give reason to watch the film again as you should now have a different prospective to view the movie.<br/><br/>The theme of dreams being difficult to differentiate from reality is emphasized the closer you get to the end of the film. We cannot really control our dreams and while we are having them we are at their mercy. Much like David is, he lives out much of the film in a dream he has no control over until the very end. This is when he really realizes it is a dream and chooses to live a real life."

","From my point of view, it is a bit difficult to know how much credit to give Vanilla Sky for integrity or smarts when taking into account that it is a remake of a film which I have never seen (Abre Los Ojos). Cameron Crowe's remake (regardless of what it owes to the Spanish film) has its weak spot but is fairly enjoyable. <br/><br/>The movie is part drama/romance part surrealism. Surrealist films are pretty tricky. I like my surrealism to be appreciable and clever (Donnie Darko, Altered States) rather than self- indulgent and disorienting (Mulholland Dr.) Vanilla Sky is a case of the former. It is arty, yet manages to tell a narratively coherent story, which allows for viewer investment. Vanilla Sky can range from funny to frightening and or from cold to touching. It is full of mood swings, and despite the fact that the finished product feels like three movies, it is never dull. (although the ending may be a couple minutes too long)<br/><br/>What I like about Vanilla Sky is how it (eventually) acknowledges that the viewer is being put on a borderline of dream and reality. Instead of an 'open to interpretation' scenario, The screenplay comes with a good share of climactic explanation, which enriches the thematic material and the emotion. It is essential that Vanilla Sky be a subjective story. We have to be one with Tom Cruise. Even though he is not entirely a respectable character, we come to understand him by the end. <br/><br/>The character, I have no problem with. I was more bothered by the performance. Cruise brings his character to life in a fashion that is too spectacular for comfort. Basically he overacts. This kind of 'kabuki theatre' performance may have been more understandable if Stanley Kubrick was directing. In scene one, he drives through Times square, and there is not a soul to be seen. This I find impressive. It hard to imagine any film production company (not even Spielbergs) having the power to clear and block off one of the World's most famous and busiest commerical areas. (Usually movie companies come to Toronto to recreate New York). For all I know this could have been a digital effect. Either way, it looks flawless.<br/><br/>If anything, it just goes to show that Vanilla Sky always has your attention, right from the beginning. To be able to sustain that for two hours in a movie that has a sense of unconventional artiness to it is impressive. It's not a terrific movie, but it has been thought through and executed well enough, that it is recommendable as both a surrealist movie and a emotional drama."

","'Vanilla Sky' can easily rank among the greatest movies of all times. It's a MASTERPIECE of a movie. I don't understand the criticism associated with it. It's a rare achievement and has qualities which very few movies possess. It lingers on in your mind even after very long. One year on, and it still stays with me. Though broadly classified as a 'Science Fiction' movie, it has elements of romance and suspense in it. Don't know about the others but I found it a little creepy at times. Especially the 'Power upheaval' part and when Tom Cruise's character performs strange histrionics and hand movements with the psychiatrist. Opening Radiohead's Soundtrack 'Everything in its right place' builds the intrigue right from the onset and REM's 'Sweetness follows' aptly complements the situation when David is forsaken and betrayed by his friends. After all suspense building, the climax doesn't disappoint either. An amazing climax with all the other ingredients, makes 'Vanilla Sky' a treat with great repeat value."

It deals with interesting topics, has an engaging and intriguing plot line as well as excellent acting. I have watched it multiple times and it does not get boring.

"garethwatkin","5","1","3","27 February 2009"," A List of Over-Rated Opinions Elaborately Explained.
","I had high hopes for this film. Prior to watching, I had heard good things about it, and had also been informed, that there was a particularly clever and well-thought out twist awaiting the eager viewer at the end of the film. Sadly, for me, this was not so. <br/><br/>Getting the criticism out of the way first, which'll provide me the opportunity to leave this review on a high note... Firstly, starting from the very beginning. I was quite disappointed with the opening. I watched this on Channel4, and stupidly, listening to the pre-film clip featuring a bunch of taxis in New York, I heard the presenter explain that next film is Vanilla Sky, which has one of the best opening sequences in any film. This got me on the edge of my seat, and why not? Television cannot be wrong right? (Apologies for the over-using the sarcasm) The opening sequence was good in what it was meant to be. But i was disappointed in it's choice of song. I'm an avid fan of Radiohead, and Everything In Its Right Place is one of my favourite songs, but for me, the song was unable to compliment the sequence, and the two juxtaposed each other. (However, in a sense, this can be viewed less as a criticism, and more as a praise, as the song itself is about juxtaposition.) Moving swiftly on, and away from the film's opening and going right into the deep end. (Metaphorically speaking, though it's not a particularly good one) The ending featured a twist (Which i shall not give away) which for one, appalled me. It went against everything i was ever taught in primary school. In basic learning! There are many other ways you could have ended the film, whilst retaining it's prominent themes. But this, did not, and i was appallingly disappointed. <br/><br/>Now for the bit people love, as lovers of film hate reading criticism of films they like (Hell, do people ever give proper deserved ratings out of 10 any more?) There were positive parts to the film. For one, (Although i wasn't impressed with the choice in the opening scene) The soundtrack for this film is brilliant. Every song chosen (apart from the first one) are brilliant in complimenting the film, and matching to the vivid imagery displayed. I may not be tempted to buy the film, but i am very tempted to buy the soundtrack Another strong praise is actually Tom Cruise, who i take my hat off to, if i wore a hat, which i do, if you count a woolly winter hat as one, but i'm not wearing it now, so i shall only metaphorically take it off. Cruise, who is an actor i have little respect for, shines through in brilliant form in this film. He is supported by a very strong supporting cast of Penelope Cruz and Cameron Diaz, who provide mystery within Cruise's character's life, which for me was poorly summed up. For the people who say Cruise cannot act, this is a prime example of how he 'can' act. Another thing i liked within this film, was a small subtle thing. The references to French New Wave. By law, i'm supposed to hate French New Wave, having been forced to study it in my Film Studies classes, but oddly, i like the films, and it was amusing to spot posters of famous films like Breathless within this film. Last point i shall make, as no doubt, anyone who has had the capacity to read this far is probably bored out of their skull, and is wishing they had strayed over to the message boards to find posts 'not-by-me' (Which sadly, won't work either, as i've been vividly expressing the parts i dislike about this film) The other thing i loved was Mis-En-Scene, which ties in with my last praise for the film. There were some beautiful shots within this film, and although i may not have liked the concept of the ending sequence, i certainly loved the look of it. The beautiful sky, with it's rich colours. It was simply just beautiful to look at.<br/><br/>Too sum up my elaborately labelled points which hold absolutely no relevance to anything whatsoever. This film for me, despite having it's good points, is simply average. Yes, i may have loved some parts, but there are a thousand other films which i like for the same reasons, and more! For me, this film just could not live up to it's terrible conclusion, and what might be unfair to describe as, but i'll say it anyway, over-rated beginning. Certainly watch this film, I'm never one to say what you should watch and what you shouldn't. But it's not a film i'll be re-watching in a hurry."

"MovieDude1893","10","1","3","29 November 2008"," Crowe's Stylistic Apex
","It begins with sweeping overhead shots of a New York City slowly succumbing to the chill of late fall. As the camera moves closer, it seems to blink and on the soundtrack we hear the first dialog of the film. ""Open your eyes"" followed by the foreboding tones of Radiohead's Everything in its Right Place.<br/><br/>The opening of Vanilla Sky immediately begins to separate itself from every film in Cameron Crowe's cannon. This is a film of delicate construction and careful planning.<br/><br/>The setup is simple enough: young playboy David Aames (Tom Cruise) is on top of the world. He has inherited control of all three of his father's magazines, and all the other ""keys to the kingdom"". David can have any woman he wants, including his personal friend with ""benefits"" Julie Gianni (Cameron Diaz), however he is caught off guard when he meets Sofia (Penelope Cruz). They spark an immediate bond and spend the night having a deep conversation like only Crowe can write. (Of course this is set to the tune of Solsbury Hill.) This sparks jealousy in Julie, who in a single action sends the film through the looking glass and into a world of murder, dreams and psychedelia.<br/><br/>Vanilla Sky was initially released in 2001, a very good year for the certain type of film that requires numerous viewings to unwrap and dissect the riddles they present. In a single year we had Nolan's Memento, Kelly's Donnie Darko and this film. The former two films have gained a substantial cult following (#28 and #124 on IMDb's Top 250 respectively) however, Vanilla Sky remains the best and most undervalued film of that trio.<br/><br/>The film is Crowe's first true directorial triumph, not his best film but his most stylistically advanced and intoxicating. In Vanilla Sky Crowe brings a mash of pop culture as signposts within the film. Keep an eye out for tiny details such as programs on T.V. or ringtones of a phone. He designs shots to subconsciously resemble classic images. However, this visual growth doesn't undercut the reliables in Crowe's bag of tricks. Vanilla Sky includes every Crowe staple: dialog that seems to immediately enter the lexicon, carefully drawn characters, subtle character driven humor and of course the achingly perfect soundtrack. Yet, I view as completely reliant on Crowe's previous film, Almost Famous. With that film Crowe sharpened his production values only to unleash them at their apex here. In Famous Crowe mastered the art of clear storytelling, allowing him to play with the structure of the medium with Vanilla Sky.<br/><br/>The performances are also of a higher level. Cruise sheds all of his Maguire-tics to create a character that begins with all the answers and by the end has none of them left. Diaz brings a fierce believability to her role. And perhaps most surprisingly, Kurt Russell (as David's shrink) brings his uniquely human charm to a role that will be perceived in new ways by the end credits.<br/><br/>Although only seven years old, Vanilla Sky has emerged in my mind as a great film of many layers. I've seen it countless times, yet with each viewing it continues to reveal further depths. I fear it may forever remain a mystery; however I am confident that it will stay an intricate and confounding masterwork."

","Halfway through watching Vanilla Sky, I was willing to let go of the whole damn thing and give up on watching it. The plot jumped from drama to romance to suspense and so on, not giving you too many threads or clues as to what's really going on. Thing is, if you lack the proper patience, you lack the tools to fully realize the masterpiece that director Cameron Crowe has created for us here. <br/><br/>Vanilla Sky chronicles the strange events that occur to one David Aames (portrayed accurately by the ever so talented Tom Cruise), a 33 year-old New York playboy, who's lavish lifestyle and reckless behavior is about to take a sudden and extremely violent twist. Aames is the sole inheritor of a publishing company and a real lady's man. After encountering the beautiful Sofia at a party (Penelope Cruz, who also became Cruise's real-life partner for a while at the time this movie hit theaters), David seemingly has a reason to finally settle down and let go of his hectic manners. Unfortunately, that's exactly when reality comes around in the shape of Julie, a hurt and neglected ex-lover who's determined to settle the score with him once and for all  thus denying him the chance of love and happiness he took away from her so abruptly. The jaded lover (Cameron Diaz, in an eccentric and unconventional role) takes David on a highway to hell, driving them both into a tragic car accident. When David wakes up, his face is deformed, his ownership of the company is at risk, and he's haunted by whatever has happened to Julie. Our hero has to grow up and adjust to the harsh reality quickly, or else he'll lose what little he has left. However, adapting to the new status isn't as easy as it may seem. Something has changed in his post-accident life, and he can't quite put his finger on it. Whatever it is, it all comes down to the choices he made after the accident, those turns of fate that now come back to haunt him, thrusting his life into a nightmarish reality  if, indeed, you can call his existence a reality<br/><br/>Throughout the film, Tom Cruise plays the tormented David with such accuracy, you really believe he's going through all these highly surreal events. In the end, without spoiling the film entirely, it's all about the way we handle the choices we make in life, and our never ending pursuit after the things we want the most. It's that bittersweet feeling you can always open your eyes and take the other path in life, that also made me return to this film and watch it over and over again throughout the course of the 5.5 years that went by since I first watched it in theaters. <br/><br/>In time, I found many comparisons between the film and the general feel of this decade  which Vanilla Sky captures best. When Cruise's David loses his looks and becomes old real fast, it's the filmmaker foreshadowing our need, as a society, to wake up and face our problems instead of running away from them. The mixture of genres also blends well into this theory, as none of us really know how to approach the historical shifts all around us. When David runs through the empty streets and passes the abandoned Times Square, I saw our whole generation seeking for something familiar amidst the cold and aggressive present. <br/><br/>Bottom line - after watching hundreds and hundreds of Hollywood products from the 2000's, Vanilla Sky remains one of the most compelling and brilliant films I am yet to have seen this decade. It's an intense and intriguing story from A to Z, which really only makes you understand it completely towards the final quarter of the film, when it shifts into yet another genre - Science Fiction. <br/><br/>P.S.: Watch out for one of the most bizarre uses of a Beach Boys song toward the end of the movie, when all things truly go berserk."

"eamon-hennedy","10","1","3","23 August 2005"," A rarity. A Hollywood movie with a heart and a brain.
","This is one of those movies for me that gives me a buzz on how perfect cinema can be when it wants to be. Films that have fallen into this philosophy are The Matrix, The Shawshank Redemption, Batman Begins and this film, Vanilla Sky. Clever, intellectual and deeply, deeply moving, this is in my opinion the best film that Cameron Crowe has made and features the finest performance of Tom Cruise's career, more so that Magnolia and Jerry Maguire (even though I love those two films too). It's just that this is a film that you can really bite into, read into, enjoy and interpret in your own way. It's a surprise that this film is like that. It is to all intents and purposes a Hollywood thriller almost, but it transcends that and becomes almost as much of a personal experience for the viewer as it obviously was for Crowe. Crowe directs and writes the movie as the master-crafts man he is, almost in a similar way that Spielberg (who makes a cameo appearance near the start of the movie) and Hitchcock have done with their own films. <br/><br/>Everything about this film is right, there is not a single thing wrong with it. From the performances of everyone, from Cruise to Cruz, Jason Lee, Tim Spall and Noah Taylor, to Nancy Wilson's terrific score (the acoustic guitar theme that plays throughout is deeply haunting and moving) and the terrific choices of songs for the soundtrack (one that is right up there with Pulp Fiction and Top Gun), the film is perfect in the extreme, so much so that you simply want to shout from the heavens to everyone that will listen how good it is. The tour de force of the film is the emotions it conveys, because this is quite simply the saddest and poignant film that I have ever seen. I admit, I almost cried my eyes out at the end when David has to chose between going back to his dream world or taking a chance on the real world, one without his beloved Sophia and his vanilla sky. In any other movie this final scene would have been destabilized with lesser hands and possibly have dived into a world of schmaltz and sickening sentimentality, but Crowe keeps it real, as real as a twist taking the movie 150 years into the future can be. That final moment between Cruise and Cruz is the most perfect moment in mainstream cinema.<br/><br/>Words cannot describe how much I love this movie. It is perfect, it probes the brains, strains the heart and proves that in Hollywood there will always be room for thought provoking and daring cinema."

","When I saw this movie for the first time there was only one thing I could say after watching this film: Wow! There are two types of movies out there, <br/><br/>1.) a movie that you watch just to be entertained. If this is the type of movie you are looking for, then don't watch this movie, because while the story is easy to follow and it is highly entertaining, you will be challenged to think after viewing.<br/><br/>2.) a movie that challenges the viewer to think on an intellectual level. This is a more rare type of movie, and my personal favorite. As you have probably noticed, these movies get terrible reviews and are soon forgotten. This group includes ""Instinct"" and ""Sphere"" While Tom Cruise goes through the whole recalling past thing and thinking that his face is disfigured the movie portrays how we recall the occasional bad thing from life and manifest it upon ourselves to be a ""dominating"" part or our lives. In the end we discover that this horrible mutation we have brought ourselves to believe is us simply is a dream. The leap from the building symbolizes the awakening from our manifestation and progress into a later part of our life. On a simpler level, viewers are proposed with the idea that life as we know it is a dream and that perhaps this interaction with others is a construct developed by our own comatose state in order to keep us rational.<br/><br/>The thing that makes this movie different from others in its group is while ""Instinct"" challenges the idea of reform in our ways of life, and ""Sphere"" challenges the idea of manifested self-destruction, ""Vanilla Sky"" challenges the idea of our outlook on life and how we manifest our past traumas onto ourselves to destroy ourselves."
"Alex-Tsander","4","1","3","23 April 2005"," Two stories stuck together like the wreckage of crashed cars.
","I've seen both versions and they share the same peculiar flaw. The first two thirds set up a situation in one set of terms. The last third introduces a completely new set of terms as an ""explanation"". It seems in the Spanish version that the director set up a plot that he only belatedly realised the audience would be totally unable to understand. An essentially metaphysical scenario. Then he panicked and added on a completely different entity, essentially science-fiction, as an easy ""explanation"". Then the American version directly copied the entire package, importing the basic flaw.<br/><br/>The work contains a great deal of promising material. For example, how Cameron Diaz manages in spite of her gorgeousness to depict a somehow loathsome character, which I at first thought to be only ""me"" before I realised that it was intentional. But the fundamental disjuncture between the two aspects of the film is gigantic, like a broken spine, that it essentially scuppers it. It's like one of those cars made by welding the front of one to the back of another and then re-sprayed as a single item. Under scrutiny, the join becomes obvious."

","There is a very interesting aspect to the movie that may have been left unnoticed which refers to the fact that Tom Cruise's character may actually have died as a result from suicide, and that all the rest of the story refers to him getting adapted to his condition as a spirit, by trying to get the treatment he would be entitled to in the other dimension or parallel universe if you will. In my very particular way of seeing things, I am led to believing that whatever it was that happened to him was the result of the conditions in which he disembodied. By being deformed he may not have accepted death itself, and in this sense, was around, or even better, just wandering around the world of the living for ages until he was informed he was able to climb up to another level of threshold he was sent to, this being understood as the Suicidal Valley. It might as well be understood that his jump was the moment of evolution of his spirit, despite the fact that he may have been evolved to another level even in the body of a cat, where the whole procedure of spiritual evolution would definitely get its start.

"howie73","6","1","3","10 April 2005"," Better than the original
","This faithful adaptation of the overrated Spanish original, Open Your Eyes( 1997)is superior to its predecessor in many ways. Firstly, director Cameron Crowe avoids the original's mistake of making the lead character deeply unlikeable and unsympathetic. Gone is the sullen Cesar from the original! Conversely, Cruise's playboy tycoon David is much more sympathetic character, whose flaws are not grounded solely on a nihilistic desire to end his nightmarish paranoia, but rather to find meaning in the lucid dream he has entered. Crowe presents David as a human figure, holding on to his only chance of first love. The original, in contrast, was lost in its own nihilistic cul de sac. Little was shown of Cesar's inner life. Crowe has a field day examining the nature of memory through media-saturated images that stay in our mind - album covers, songs, film clips. They all make up the texture of the human mind and memory - and it's this aspect (which was missing from the original) that invests Vanilla Sky with a surprising intellectual dimension. Is our memory constructed so much by the media that we cannot differentiate levels of reality? The notion of the lucid dream is represented more vividly in Vanilla Sky than the obscure, quasi-Descartian fluff about artificial perception in the original. Crowe ties lucid dream to corporate re-branding of reality and in this sense is saying much more than the flat rendering of this hyper-reality dreamed up in the cold, austere original.<br/><br/>Sometimes remakes are better than the original."
"philip_vanderveken","8","1","3","1 April 2005"," Tom Cruise like we don't see him enough
","I'm always on the lookout for the not so average movie. I don't mean things like horror movies with so much gore and blood that it makes it almost impossible to watch, I mean movies that try to be original and which don't seem like you've seen them already 25 times before, even though it's the first time you've seen this movie. Well, Vanilla Sky is such a movie.<br/><br/>David Aames (Tom Cruise) is a very popular magazine publisher from New York City. He takes everything for granted: his wealth, his publishing company, his good looks, and most of all his relationships. He's a playboy who spends a passionate night with Julie (Cameron Diaz), ""a friend he sometimes sleeps with,"" and a night with Sofia (PenÃ©lope Cruz), a beautiful and smart dancer with a Spanish accent. But than he gets all kinds of strange dreams which may reveal something very important about him, something he never knew...<br/><br/>Of course this isn't exactly the easiest of all movies and yes it is quite surprising. Surprising, not only because you get to see Cameron Diaz and Tom Cruise in a role you wouldn't exactly expect from them, but also because of the ending. People who prefer easier movies probably don't like this one, but people who are used to watch alternative and European movies, will almost certainly love it. <br/><br/>I guess that the main problem which this movie may encounter is the fact that it is a remake of a Spanish movie and only therefore will not be liked by many people on this site. This movie was based on ""Abre Los Ojos"" (or ""Open your Eyes"" in English). Personally I don't really care about the fact if this is a remake or not, but I know that many people do. I guess that's why it doesn't get a very high score, which is too bad really. Personally I give it at least a 7.5/10 perhaps even an 8/10. I really liked this movie."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","8","1","3","12 June 2004"," A very interesting and fascinating film, though the original is better
","First, I'd like to mention that since watching this, I have seen Abre Los Ojos(or 'Open Your Eyes', as it's called in English), the film which this is a remake of. Upon comparison, the Spanish original is by far the better film, in my opinion, in that it is more ambiguous and dark, and more of a science fiction piece, less of a drama. I won't claim that this means that this movie is nothing more than a Hollywood version of the original(as some might suspect it is). This does have its own merit, and Crowe does a fairly good job of translating the film without losing the essence. The film is very interesting, as it's based on a pretty old idea in science fiction(which I won't reveal here, as it's impossible to tell it without giving away the twist of the film, thereby pretty much ruining the experience of it), and it utilizes this idea, which is pretty much the main theme of the film(though you don't know this until the very end) very good. The plot is very good, something most people can relate to, and it moves along at an pretty good pace, but on repeated viewings it does get a little boring. The character development is well-handled, you know what you want and need to know about the characters. The acting is all good, there isn't really any of the actors who doesn't do his or her job well. The characters are well-written and credible. I enjoyed the humor in the film, and the well-placed self-irony of Tom Cruise's character in some scenes. There isn't a lot of humor in the film, but the amount there is, is just right, I think. I liked the film for messing with the audience's mind so much. I will, however, agree with those that say that the end explained too much; it didn't leave much room for further analysis, instead it just handed the answers to you on a silver platter. That was a bad decision, definitely, and it was far better in the original, Spanish film. Explaining everything might have opened it up to a broader audience, but dumbing it down like that disappointed a lot of people who could have figured it out by themselves, and should have been given the chance. Alejandro Almenabar is, by far, the superior director, and his version, the original, Abre Los Ojos, is definitely better than this, and more intelligent, less mainstream. I do think Cameron Crowe did a nice job, though.

","I'd heard mainly negative criticism about this film and my expectations were low, so perhaps I could be pleasantly surprised, unfortunately not.<br/><br/>First of all, the story is very weak.  I generally like these type of films, `Welcome to Blood City', being a great example.  Question who we are, our place in the universe and our perceptions of the world are all interesting themes.  The problem is the story is quite simplistic and is presented in an annoying disjointed manner.  I know this was done deliberately, but spread over 2 hour +, this can get very annoying.  The filmmakers really needed to make the collapse of the VR much more gradual and subtle leading up to a crescendo, but atlas it was a mixed mess.<br/><br/>On story and presentation, maybe the film would have got a 5 or 6/10 from me.  After watching probably one of the worst actors in Hollywood (Mr Cruise, in case I needed to clarify) present one of the most obnoxious uninteresting characters I have ever seen, what's with this stupid boyish grin the whole time.  Add Penelope Cruz, who was almost as bad, then you have no believability and no chemistry whatsoever.  Jason Lee, was also very unconvincing as 'the friend' which Cruise treated like crap.  Actually Jason Lee repeated his performance in `Almost Famous', yet another poor effort from Mr Crowe.<br/><br/>Thirdly the length of the film, shorten it for God's sake, a plot this weak, doesn't need 2+ hours to send people to sleep, it could do it in 80 minutes.<br/><br/>It's a shame about Mr Crowe, Jerry Maguire was excellent, IMO, but I recently saw Almost Famous and Singles, both were very poor, the only redeeming feature was that Singles had the best band in the world playing on the soundtrack (Pearl Jam, which I'm sure you already knew).<br/><br/>3/10."

","Post-hippie/yuppie-pothead smugness, done up like a ""Twilight Zone"" episode with a really large budget. Tom Cruise is a magazine publishing mogul in New York City who immediately seems to have a hard time distinguishing his reality from his dreams; soon, he finds himself imprisoned, masked, and talking to a doctor about a murder he has apparently committed. Proving that the greatest asset a film can possibly have is a strong screenplay, ""Vanilla Sky"" is a series of half-hearted whims and self-indulgent larks. The shards of reality and non-reality, interpolated in rapid succession, aren't so much truthful glimpses into our hero's mind as they are Cameron Crowe's cocky idea of a mind-screw. Crowe is like a jovial rich kid messing with the switches and his film is the equivalent of a joy-buzzer, both a curious paean to popular culture and the (would-be) ultimate brain-gasm. It doesn't make much sense in the end, and it doesn't elicit much interest either, mostly because 90% of the characters are cyphers. ** from ****"

"indianmansteamer","4","1","4","8 June 2005"," Tom Cruise _IS_ the Amercan Alain Delon
","An interesting film that portrays the struggles of the idealistic young Mr. Cruise, who is challenged to employ his idealism in the service of the Japanese war effort in WW II. A key aspect of this struggle is the protagonist's struggle within himself. Tom Cruise, the young man, seeks to humanize the brutal conditions at a mining operation in Manchester. Further complicating matters is the profound sense of national prejudice that shapes the relationships between the various characters. To the workers & Welsh prisoners, regardless of his professed ideals, Cruise is America and therefore an oppressor. Although Cruise tries to win their trust, his own frustration enables him to strike a young Welsh helper, reinforcing the image of the brutal America. This weakness is a key underlying theme. Even late in the film, when he takes a very brave stand against some executions, his effort is a bit late and his stand is successful only when the Welsh prisoners take up the protest. He struggles because her fears he cannot live up to the ideals he expresses.<br/><br/>Cruise is also confronted with the another irony. Although he opposes the war, he has chosen a route of avoidance rather than resistance. This is emphasized early in the film during an evening with a friend (Penelopy Cruise) who is about to be inducted. She comments that, although they opposed the war, neither of them was brave enough to face the penalty for resistance of life imprisonment. Shortly thereafter, he takes the mine job to get a military exemption. Yet, if he is successful, the production improvements in the mine only fuel the American War Machine.<br/><br/>A valuable film because it explores areas of the Penelope's bodice(Although smaller in size than, say, Christina Applegate's twin patronizers). Also an interesting observation in the danger of half-measures when taking a moral stance. Cruise is ultimately confronted with the fact that you cannot avoid the war, only oppose it or aid it. I look forward to viewing the next film."

I can't believe that Cameron Diaz impressed some people with this performance.  She never could act and used to be amusingly cute, but that's over for her.  She'll gladly muck up the screen in big-budget trash like Cruise has, although he was good in Magnolia and Rain Man.<br/><br/>Who enjoys this kind of tripe?

","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** When I was in grammar school, my friends and I went through a phase where all of our journal entries, the stories we wrote for class, would end in ""and it was all a dream"", or ""and then I woke up"".  I'm sure you're familiar with this device... make a crazy scenario, make the audience wonder how the hero/heroine will escape, and then ""wake up"".<br/><br/> Suppose we had been able to, back then, replace ""and then I woke up"" with ""and then I realized that I was cryogenically frozen and was experiencing a programmed brain-input deally"".  We'd have written Vanilla Sky.<br/><br/>Basically, that's your whole movie.  Guy gets into weird situation, you think he's killed someone, you're teased with a mystery (who did he kill, and did he), teased with conspiracy (did they frame him), and then it ALL GETS THROWN OUT THE WINDOW for the same ending my pals and I used in the FOURTH GRADE!!<br/><br/>The advertisements for this film tease you into thinking it will be an action-drama with a murder mystery.  Just when the film gets you compelled with this apparent plot development (not an easy task with drawn-out boring scenes, typically crappy Cruise acting, and a lead character that probably 1% of America can identify with)... just as it gets you into that, it says ""gotcha"", and goes into a laughable (people in my theater did groan and laugh) sci-fi bailout.<br/><br/>This could have been a good movie.  I was expecting a REAL twist with a plot against David and a switcheroo of sorts with the women in his life.  They could have gone so many interesting places with this situation, and then they throw it out instead of exploring it (and they throw it out fast, before we can even enjoy the suspense) and go into what equates to ""it was all a dream"".<br/><br/>And then they even spoon-feed you the details!!  ""When did the Lucid Dream begin?"", David asks... AND THE GUY TELLS YOU!!  ""Well, it was when you woke up in the street"".  Why, oh why, couln't I have been left to at least try to figure that out for myself??  Why did they have to GIVE it to me?<br/><br/>And why wasn't the relationship with David and Sophia (which was actually a Lucid Dream) explored more?  There was like 2 scenes, and then we got into the murder crap.  Why was I supposed to feel anything for David and Sophia (and feel his pain) when they barely developed that  relationship?<br/><br/>The reason they are saying that reviewers should ""not reveal secrets"" about this movies plot is because (a) if you said one or two sentences, the whole movies would be shot, as it takes only that one lame turn... and (b) if people knew that the ending was this cheezy, they would never come into the theater to see it."

This man is played by Tom Cruise who runs half of a magazine business in New York who has a affair lover on the side (Cameron Diaz who isn't that bad in her scenes), but then falls in love one night with another woman (Penelope Cruz) and then the plot unfolds from there.  You can try to follow along with where the film is going, but be warned that at some point the film diverges into the stranger, and more surreal, though it's explained at the end.

","Well, where do I start? Okay, for starters, how about that the original film ""Open Your Eyes"" by Alejandro Amenabar was an extremely pretentious, poorly shot, and deliberately confusing (even to the director himself) art film.  Now, I have nothing against art films, if there made with style and that style is backed up with substance.  But ""Open Your Eyes""  tries to be all of that, and fails by trying to be clever.  Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that Penelope Cruz is in both films. But this review is not about ""Open Your Eyes."" Cameron Crowe had just won on oscar for what I felt was the best film of 2000, ""Almost Famous.""  His other films, ""Say Anything"" ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" (which he scripted, but didn't direct), ""Jerry Maguire"", and ""Singles""  are all very intelligent, witty films about dating and growing up.  So, now Crowe decides to move out of the genre which he knows so well and make an art film.  Fine, Paul Thomas Anderson did it with ""Magnolia"" and did a bang up job.  So with that, I'll tell you that I was looking forward immensely to Vanilla Sky (I watched ""Open Your Eyes"" after ""Vanilla Sky"").<br/><br/>My high expectations were dashed to pieces with this incomprehensible plot and blatant symbolism which doesn't really make sense.<br/><br/>The story (if you can call it that) involves Tom Cruise as a vain daddy's boy, whose parents die, he inherents their thriving company and he basically makes a living making an ass out of himself.  He's sleeping with Cameron Diaz, ditches her for Penelope Cruz (who after this and Captain Corelli's Mandolin, should be deported), and then wonders why Diaz drives them both off the road in a spectacularly silly slow-motion car wreck.  The rest of the film has Cruise (now disfigured) trying to win back Cruz ... Then everything is summed up nicely at the end in an elaborate denouement which Crowe (or Amenabar) pulls out of his ass.<br/><br/>I'm not really sure who's to blame for this crap, Crowe, Amenabar, or Cruise for convincing Crowe to remake the film.<br/><br/>It's themes could have made a good movie.  It has shades of better films (""Waking Life"", ""Dark City"", Cruise's own ""Eyes Wide Shut"") but instead it takes all of its ideas and intentions and makes... no sense at all.<br/><br/>Cameron Crowe, please make another coming of age movie!

While VANILLA SKY is long and plodding, its real problem is not in the execution, but with the script. The premise is so far-fetched it's worthless. VANILLA SKY is made up of flash forwards, flashbacks and dream sequences. It resembles LSD trip films of the '60s. The mix is so confusing it's not possible to tell the real from the dreams.

I thought Vanilla Sky was panned because the audiences didn't understand its premise.  Hardly.  Crowe leaves nothing open to interpretation; rather, he spells everything out in black and white and Hollywoodizes the ending.  Everything I loved about Abre Los Ojos (Open Your Eyes), Crowe ruined.  I believed nothing.  Tom Cruise gives one of the worst performances in a decade.  Like Cruise's lack of chemistry with Rene Zellwinger in Jerry Maguire, Cruise has no chemistry with Penelope Cruz, who reprises her role from the Spanish original, in expanded and unnecessary fashion.

Almost ten years later a new love blossoms and a bad film is the end result.<br/><br/>This film is has very confusing themes, Fatal Attraction meets Memento meets Jacob's Ladder. Director Crowe attempts at the very last minute to bring everything together, but ion the meantime leaves the viewer bewildered and lost.

"zenmateisshite","5","0","1","19 February 2020"," Can movie critics be anymore pretentious?
","Since both Spanish and English version are almost scene-by-scene copies I will be reviewing them as the same movie.
The movie starts as a drama. Third of the way in you find yourself wondering: is this really deep, or is it really shallow. Moving forward, it turns into a sci-fi, kinda.
Then the story becomes needlessly complicated. Its not easy to follow but its no Memento, nor is it The Fifth Element so you end up watching till the end and after a few twists and turns the story unfolds.<br/><br/>My opinion is that the first dramatic half is truly shallow and very meh. The second sci-fi half, well they do not explain it that much, but it is also blah. Is this an original movie? Well, the idea of living in a simulation have been discussed before, if that is what the movie was about. Was it? Or was it about falling in ""love"" with someone you really have no clue about? Or is it telling us that if you're a shallow person your mind will play tricks on you if by chance you happen to become frozen in perpetual dreamland - so you need to improve your personality? Who knows.<br/><br/>I personally prefer the Spanish storyline, it makes more sense. The English version has better acting and production values, because it was done later. Both had horrible dialogue, with very awkward Spanish humor translated into English somehow.<br/><br/>The biggest problem for me is how critics on rotten tomatoes are scoring the Spanish version at 85% but the English one less than half that at 42%, even though it is virtually the same film. Sure the Spanish one was first but as mentioned, it is not really original by its own right. The difference of the scenes, storyline, acting, and language does not justify this big variance. It just goes to show how these critics are a bunch know-it-all parasites. At least here on IMDB the public scores both versions more closely."

His life changes drastically when he meets with an accident while being in the car with his resentful ex Julie Gianni(Cameron Diaz), that leaves his face hideously disfigured. What follows is a tale of love, loneliness, longing and all the evil tricks that the mind plays. One of Tom Cruise's finest acting, I believe.

"johnklem","6","0","1","4 February 2015"," Glossy but emotionally subpar remake
","I revisited Vanilla Sky recently. I wondered if my early impressions of the film might be ripe for revision. In one way they were. I came away from my second viewing with a clearer idea of the film's strengths and weaknesses. Vanilla Sky begins with a disadvantage. It's an almost frame by frame remake of the hugely successful and widely admired Spanish film Abre Los Ojos and so actively invites comparison. That's been done and I can't add anything meaningful to the debate. But since Vanilla Sky was made, there has been a rash of similarly themed movies, books and (in Britain at least) radio plays. Judged by these standards, the movie fares quite well. It's beautifully made. Everything and everyone looks wonderful. The girls in particular are perfectly cast and bring serious emotional power to their scenes. If you don't think Cameron Diaz can act, take a look at her scene with Cruise in the car. It'll send shivers up and down your spine. But that emotional punch is ultimately what the film lacks. It's the missing ingredient and the fault lies with Cruise. As the rich and impossibly charming playboy inheritee of his daddy's publishing empire, he's note perfect. Of course. Tom Cruise has made a career out of knowing his strengths and is rightly the most commercially successful actor of the last few decades. There's no denying his commitment to his craft and what serious actor could resist the lure of Charles Laughton's crown as the king of prosthetic pathos but it's the undoing of this film. All the training, all the practice, all the sheer willpower in the world cannot prepare you for a role like this. And that's the point. The role is pivotal and Cruise is not the actor to invest it with a full emotional life. Frankly, it's hard to think who would have been a better choice. Without Cruise, the film might never have been made and anyway, he's not the movie's only problem. Kurt Russel's responsible for some cringeworthy mugging, better suited to a bad daytime soap. Would I rather the film hadn't been made? No, it brought the story to a wider audience and has its own strengths. I doubt that it will be remade any time soon but if it were, I wonder what Tom Hardy would make of that central role."

","For anyone who was obsessed with Inception, Inception is a remake of Vanilla Sky really (sorry to burst your bubble), Inception was pretending to be super original but it is the same story just without the nerve that Vanilla Sky has. As with music and other art forms, people are rarely intelligent enough to appreciate something the first time around that they are exposed to it, it is after the same idea has been recycled a few times that people can finally respond to it, which is quite boring.<br/><br/>Vanilla Sky again I think has gotten some inspiration from Abre los ojos which is featuring the same actress Penelope Cruz, but I don't think this is as much plagiarism as Inception is a plagiarism of Vanilla Sky."

So I watched Vanilla Sky yesterday, and I didn't want to write a review until I completely took a while to think this movie over. I was honestly, a little afraid to watch some terrible, yet hilarious film, just because of what I had heard about it. I mean it's 2012 right now, so naturally we have already had this movie out for a good bit, and I know it's a remake and everything. But I didn't completely hate it. The whole cast was kind of iffy for me. I enjoyed Tom Cruise, I suppose. It wasn't a bad role for him, but of course we have seen better. I'm not a Cameron Diaz fan, but I think she played crazy chick pretty well, I guess other people would disagree, but hey. And of course Penelope, who already had a little work in the other film if I'm not mistaken. She did a wonderful job, and I was happy when I saw her each time. I guess mostly by the end of it I expected a huge ass twist, and it didn't really happen, it was just a minor one. I guess comparing it to like Sixth Sense, I was just like, ""Yeah...sure..."" You know, but compared to like Sixth Sense where you're more feeling, ""HOLY CRAP, but what about...and...if..."" If you get what I'm saying. I wasn't thrilled by the end of it, but I understood it, and I took it for what it was. I'm not going to say I was bored or not entertained by this film. But it's not one of those I would watch again.<br/><br/>Also before I end this whole review did anyone else feel weird about the whole Jason Lee and Tom Cruise characters being friends? I don't know, I was a little out of place with that, I wanted it to be someone else. I just couldn't picture it at all, even though they really tried. I love Jason Lee, but I just couldn't feel it. Maybe it was just me...<br/><br/>Acting-wise I would give it a 6/10 (alot to do with the fact that I couldn't hear Tom Cruise at points, and Cameron Diaz just didn't cut it for me) <br/><br/>Visually-8/10 <br/><br/>Movie-7/10"

","Personally a favorite of mine. The casting of Tom Cruise is spot on; The supporting cast is wonderful. Cameron Crowe took a big risk making this film; A science fiction thriller that you do not realize it is. Looks more like a Tom Cruise vanity film on the surface. based on the 1997 Spanish movie (Open Your Eyes) Crowe has made a masterpiece; Unfortunately with the short attention span of the movie-goer, they did not ""get it"" nor wish to understand it, nor care a rich guy came back from the dead. Much deeper then that. See it again, or see it for the 1st time. soundtrack is like all Crowe movies 1st rate and heartfelt. Cameron Crowe's Vanilla Sky is a scrupulously moral picture. Roger Ebert's said It tells the story of a man who has just about everything, thinks he can have it all, is given a means to have whatever he wants, and loses it because — well, maybe because he has a conscience. Or maybe not. Maybe just because life sucks. Or maybe he only thinks it does. This is the kind of movie you don't want to analyze until you've seen it two times."
"mittens-and-matches","4","0","1","14 July 2012"," Pretty good but fails to live up to the original
","Most people are probably not aware that this is a remake of the movie ""Abre Los Ojos"". Its not inspired by ""Abre Los Ojos"" it literally is a remake following the plot and original scenes nearly exactly. I am lucky to have read several reviews of Vanilla Sky suggesting to watch the original (which is in Spanish) before Vanilla Sky. I can only agree.<br/><br/>In Vanilla Sky Tom Cruise delivers a nice performance. In fact, his performance (aside from a couple things he does in here that are just bizarre) along with the script are what carry the film. However, Eduardo Noriega, the original actor, delivers a better performance. Penelope Cruz actually plays the same character in both movies. However, she is better in the original for a few reasons. One, she gives a more nuanced performance and comes across better in her native tongue, two, she has better chemistry on screen with Eduardo, and three, her character makes more sense playing opposite the rival girl in the original than opposite Cameron Diaz who is a little too charismatic and beautiful to be playing the role of second best.<br/><br/>The original also never lapses into mediocrity. However, here there are a number of scenes where the acting or some of the secondary characters wanes. The ending in Vanilla Sky also was shot in a way that unfortunately cheapens and takes away some of the impact of the original script (I don't want to say more and spoil it).<br/><br/>In short, I found Vanilla Sky to be an interesting watch especially as I was able to compare it to Abre Los Ojos in every scene. It is understandable that producers would want to bring the story and script of Abre Los Ojos to a more mainstream audience, as it is brilliant, and therefore make Vanilla Sky. However, as often happens with remakes this one lacks the power of the original and I can only really recommend to you to see the original first."

","This is one of the greatest movies of all time. But what do you expect when you team up the greatest actor (Tom Cruise) of his generation with one of the greatest storyteller of the last 10 years (Cameron Crowe)? Furthermore, every actor in this film brings their A-game. Aside from the top shelf story, it's the actors that enable this film to stand apart from the rest of 2001-2. Cameron Diaz practically re-invents the desperate woman persona and Penelope Cruz shines as love at its most innocent. Kurt Russell once again gives such a splendid performance that you forget ""Tango and Cash,"" ""Soldier,"" and ""Overboard."" He is sensitive yet demanding all at once. And towards the end of the film, he nails what should have been an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor (or at least a Golden Globe) when he switches roles with Cruise. Once confident in himself, his life, and his profession, he becomes vulnerable, scared, and angry at what his life might actually be. Jason Lee stars in perhaps the weakest of roles, however, he gives it his all. Given some of the movie's cornier lines, he delivers them as if it's Shakespeare In the Park. He is truly an actor's actor. And Cruise? He's brilliant as usual.******* POSSIBLE SPOILER********** His performance reminds me of something Roger Ebert said about the film ""Birdy,"" starring Matthew Modine and Nicholas Cage. He admired the skill of both actors because they had to give up what were then their most important assets as actors: Modine his personality and Cage his... I can't tell you the latter or I'd give away the movie. However, if you are familiar with Roger Ebert or ""Birdy"" you may have guessed it. But the point is, Cruise must give up both of the assets to express the confusion and anger of David Aames. This film is a treat, and anyone who watches it will surely want to see it 20 more times."

","Vanilla Sky is, obviously, a very unnecessary film. Hollywood's ever growing tendency to hijack every somewhat successful foreign film and remake it in English for the local market is one of the worst diseases of the American film industry; this remake of Alejandro Amenábar's excellent Abre los ojos - made only three years after the original's release - is, by its conception, no better than any of them.<br/><br/>And yet - and yet, I like Vanilla Sky. I can't say that I like it as much as Abre los ojos, but that's mainly because it lacks the element of originality. Some elements aren't as strong as the original, and there's definitely a Hollywoodian feeling that distracts, but the remake has many strengths as well - other than the obviously bigger budget, the biggest advantage it has is director Cameron Crowe. Crowe adapted the film nearly word-for-word and shot-for-shot, but he lent it his own style, his own penchant for pacing, and of course an excellent soundtrack which includes artists as varied as Radiohead, The Monkees, Red House Painters and Sigur Rós. Crowe's smoother, more elegant approach is just as appropriate for the story as Amenábar's grittiness, if not more, and it's actually quite refreshing to see these two different approaches to an almost identical film.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise also does a surprisingly good job. While Jason Lee and Kurt Russell don't quite work out in their roles, I actually liked Cruise better than Eduardo Noriega in the lead. Cruise lends the role the same airheaded, self-important naiveté he had in Jerry Maguire, to darker results, and supplies one of his better performances. I also liked - nay-sayers be damned - the increased emphasis on the sci-fi elements, which work as a truly surprising turn when they finally appear.<br/><br/>Vanilla Sky isn't as complex or intelligent as Abre los ojos. Instead, it's more stylish and more dynamic, and as a film by its own right, it works just as well. Despite the many similarities these are two different films, and I like them both."

As his new fate would have it, Julie dies, David does not. He survives, but his face is destroyed. It becomes a scary cross to bear. We watch in dismay as the charismatic wunderkind reverts to awkward, juvenile social traits he once outgrew The masterful make-up of Aames post-crash face makes Cruise look alternately tragic, comic, frightful and pathetic, but all in sympathetic measure. Unable to abide this, Aames adopts a facial prosthetic that makes him look embarrassed, guilty, resentful and maudlin. Its haunted, plastic pout seems to plead, ""how could this be happening to me?"" Good friends try to help Aames with his pride as he slides into identity crisis. An effortlessly hip self-image was Aames' brand. The winning smile was his logo. Where did it all suddenly go? He's supposed to be the ace of a magazine empire, where cheated images pervade the pages. How very, very thin are a few layers of skin. To solve the dilemma of living life with either a deformed or a synthetic face, David Ames has his brain wired to some kind of pre-programmed dream that plays in his head while his body sleeps in cryogenic peace, presumably waiting for a technological breakthrough in reconstructive surgery. To ensure his dream on ice is nice and hot, Aames contracts with a shady tech company for a digital lover. It is, of course, Sophia, the wise, whimsical dancer he fell in love with before the accident. If the first crucial turning point was when Aames got in Julie's car, the next one is his choice to go to sleep and dream of love with Sophia rather than face the problem that stopped him in his tracks. What is the metaphor in that deep freeze we never get a look at in the center of this movie? How often lately have we seen our real life corporate and government leaders behave like leading men; on-screen pushing some fantasy romance with the voter/consumer, off-screen betting secret dreams and science will make-up their bets. This expertly tailored film scenario proceeds with Aames attaining what he never could in real life, true love. Achieving increasingly lucid states, he tries to take over the fantasy and make it real. It only brings more pain as Aames mistakes Sophia for Julie and his embrace tightens like a chain around her in bed, not loving but smothering her to death instead. It's a dreadful scene to watch and lands the masked Aames into a shadowy prison cell where he pleads his case to a corduroy shrink with perfect pitch played by Kurt Russell. This dose of therapy enables Aames to open a connection with the corporation that provides his dreams and confirm that the memory of Sophia's murder is complete artifice. It's just a technical glitch in the program caused by Aames efforts to gain control of the illusion. The mask eventually becomes a burden greater than the flaw he is trying to conceal, and it does come off eventually, but not without a piece of his hide. The mask has no power of it's own. It is a simple law of nature that any hiding place becomes a prison, the consequences of putting off an appointment with destiny. To attempt to live above, or be immune to, or cheat one's way through always ends up working against you. With the assistance of a tech support angel our hero eventually thaws out 130 years later. He can feel the weight of his real problems again and the consequences of going to sleep. Forsaking his privileged mindset he's grateful to leave the fantasy behind for ""real life."" Why did I like this story? Most of us are just as prone to this same character defect. I learned a lot from watching an ego, a mask and a shattered face all try to occupy the same space. In what ways am I sleepwalking in some illusion? We all seem to have to learn the same lesson about this. What else could explain how unbalanced our world feels? And how long will business and government leaders play make-believe with the future? Eventually they have to come out from behind their masks of company and committee and face the consequences too. Because, as this film makes so abundantly clear, we're all just putting off the inevitable."

"carrera_cabriolet-1","Null","0","1","18 October 2011"," It's brilliant
","This is an all time favorite of mine. When I was an undergraduate I became friends with a fellow math major who was obviously brilliant. His father had died when he was young, and he was obsessed with living forever. Even during the time I knew him, he taught himself neuroscience (while studying math), and came up with various ideas for preserving our brains. He used to bounce these ideas off of me, but his learning rate was so far beyond mine, he quickly lost me. When we parted ways, he was building a machine to slice up brains. That's right--his idea, after studying neuroscience was to slice up the brains of a cared-for deceased so thinly that the neural connections to be saved as data. He even began building a machine to do it in his garage. He must be pretty smart because he's a post-doc at Harvard now. In any case, we used to talk about the prospect of saving the configuration of a person's brain. If, for example, the reader were to have all of their neurons wired the way mine are right now, that person would think like me. That person would _be_ me. When suitable technology comes, will they go fix the brains of people in cryogenic freezing? I don't think so. They'll figure out how their brains are wired and then use a computer to simulate them. That person would suddenly become alert as computer program ran, thinking exactly like they do. This is science. It's hard science. It's futuristic--the details are fantastically complicated, but if society rolls on, it will be a reality. Maybe people will live out what is shown in this film. In this respect, this movie is excellent. I think Tom's acting is superb. Aside from just the science, I enjoyed the film itself and was intrigued the whole time because it is real. This film gets it right. People aren't quite ready for it. But maybe they think it's just too silly. Well, it's not that silly as this old friend of mine has proved."

","I don't understand why some people thought this was a bad movie. The acting was great, the soundtrack acceptable, and the editing and camera angles were used magnificently. The only parts I didn't like was when David Aames was talking with McKay.<br/><br/>I liked the ending. The effects were good. Some people are complaining about the ending, saying ""It explains nothing!"" or, ""Oh, is Sofia really Julie?"". It's ALL explained in the elevator scene, where they ride up to David's true moment of choice.<br/><br/>The soundtrack was decent. I liked the songs by Sigur Ros on there. They fit the movie well... but some of the songs on their were eccentric and weird. The music in the end scene fit perfectly as David has his final conversation with Sofia before taking a literal leap of faith.<br/><br/>Penelope Cruz, Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz (along with many other cast members) did a fantastic job in this film. Tom portrayed a character who was afraid of heights well, he portrayed a drunk man well... and so on. <br/><br/>Overall, I think Vanilla Sky is a pretty decent movie. Good enough to put under a Christmas tree. I give it an 8/10."

","This one has been sitting on my PVR for a while so I finally got round to watching it...<br/><br/>Wasn't what I expected! Its not great but its certainly good. As a Lynch/SF fan I appreciated those elements but its certainly no Mulholland Drive (another reviewer here thinks Vanilla Sky is better which did make me smirk quite a lot!).<br/><br/>It gets 7/10 for me because although its very good in places, its rather drawn out in others. The music didn't help either - I pretty much hated or didn't like or the music used in this film. I can honestly say that if this had had a good soundtrack (like Mulholland Drive for instance ;) ) I would have liked it more.<br/><br/>To conclude - its a bit long and the soundtrack is pretty horrible (unless you like this kind of bland middle of the road rubbish). BUT if you are a Lynch/SF/mystery fan give it a go. I can see this one appealing to women as much as men but its not a straightforward date film - you will have to think a bit (and it might get you thinking too!)"

","Although Vanilla sky has had many bad reviews it doesn't make it a reason not to see it. This movie is extremely miss understood and not many understand the plot as it becomes very complicated, due to the fact that its linked with knowing the difference between reality and dreams many try to over analyse the movie and try to find hidden meanings. Watching this movie in that frame of mind will over complicate it and thus you will not enjoy it at all. Watching the movie for what it is simply a Sci-fi film will make you appreciate and understand it. The messages that come through the film such as "" every passing minute is a chance to turn it all around"" is very clever and keeps you wondering long after you have watched the film and all those times in life where you have wondered "" what if""."

Except me. I actually kind of liked it. It was confusing, but interesting, and trippy, and well acted. Though lots of things are left out of explanation, I still kind of liked it.

The two begin to see each other. But things go out of control after Jane(played excellently by Cameron Diaz),a jealous former lover, get in a car accident. From here on, the plot gets harder to explain.<br/><br/>I can't really describe this film. It's beyond words. It has it's flaws. For one thing, things are explained, but not well enough. Two: some of it doesn't make sense. Three: The film goes off the rails. But I am still recommending it.<br/><br/>Why? I liked how trippy it was. I liked how complex it was. The acting was good, especially from Cameron Diaz. It's highly original, But yet I can only give it a B because you aren't positive about it. You don't fully understand it at the end.

","Everything from the opening scene of a desolate Times Square to the final scene of David falling from the building, everything about ""Vanilla Sky"" is beautiful and mesmerizing. <br/><br/>The script could not have been better. With a mix of mystery, thriller, drama, and even a little humor, this film has the perfect balance of all of my favorite movie types all wrapped into one. <br/><br/>I recently read online that one ending for this could have been that the entire movie was a dream or that it was all a fictional story written by Brian. I am really glad that they decided to not go that route and instead to have half the movie real and half of it a dream.<br/><br/>Every scene in the movie had a purpose and it was all beautifully done. I already mentioned the first and final scenes, but there is also the car ride and crash, the scenes with the doctor where we try to figure out what happened, the party, the time he spent with Sofia, the night at the bar, and many more.<br/><br/>I love Tom Cruise and thought that he was perfect for this role. The subtle things like his facial expressions or sarcastic reactions make him one of the best in the world at what he does. The supporting cast is also great in their roles. <br/><br/>The music in this film also adds to the beauty and emotion. From David going crazy and singing ""What if God was One of Us"", to ""Can we Still be Friends"" when he is smothering Sofia with the pillow and especially with Sigur Rós playing in the final fall; all of the music that was chosen was right on point. <br/><br/>I can't say enough about this film, but it is an absolute masterpiece. I will be surprised if I ever view a movie I enjoy more than ""Vanilla Sky""."

","This movie was allot of things to me. It was strangely beautiful, oddly touching. Complex, brilliant, stunning , grand, outrageously entertaining; need I go on? Vanilla Sky was a movie at first I didn't think I would like but after awhile I saw that there was more too it than meet's the eye. It was a very touching movie in an odd sense it shows you the trails and tribulations of a man trying to grasp whether or not his world is real or a dream.<br/><br/>There are things in life we don't quite understand and there are things we do, this film explores the latter it explores the perception that our world does sometimes seem like a dream and that things we do and things we don't can effect the realm of our imagination and the realm of our life. This movie doves deep into the physic of the human mind and it plucks at every sense and every feeling to provoke the main stimulus of our mind and it does it so well with such style and artistic beauty, It's a quintessential movie that mus be seen with an open mind and heart to fully comprehend the complex nature of it's story and it's deeper underlined meaning that is unearthed as the story moves along. It's astoundingly well made and crafted and is something that is going to become a classic as time goes on.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise(who was utterly fantastic here.) delivers one of his most potent and brilliant performances as wealthy playboy David Aames, Jr. an successful publisher who finds his whole life turned upside down. Kurt Russell does as just a good job as Cruise in his forceful performance as the compassionate psychiatrist who becomes a father figure to Cruise and brings Cruise's character out of his dark place. It's a great father son type of relationship to see unfold on screen. Penelope Cruz does amazing here she's so graceful and beautiful and is something amazing to watch on screen, she's fantastic! But the real weak point in this film was Cameron Diaz, her performance was so annoying and bland that when she died you showed no pity what so ever. But besides that the rest of the cast holds up very nicely and does a fantastic job.<br/><br/>This movie is a mind bending, melting pot of a film it's meant to bring out the most elated feeling of power and sorrow from the deepest part's of your mind. It's a film you can't miss at all it's amazing, breath taking, dark and so entertaining to watch. Vanilla Sky is a shoot out the lights , blow your hair back, mind blowing experience you have just got to see. All in all Vanilla Sky is a wild trip you'll want to take."

","Tom Cruise plays David Aames, a young man with everything going for him,good looks,a successful career and on top of that he's extremely wealthy.On his birthday party he meets Sofia Serrano, a simple yet charming woman and becomes attracted to her.After spending some time with Sofia, David gets into a car accident and when he wakes up after the accident nothing is the same and his life takes a turn for the surreal.Its extremely hard to talk about Vanilla Sky without spoiling it but lets say that it combines several genres of movies and it keeps you guessing from the beginning to the end with some very unexpected twists. The movie plays with perceptions while at the same time pushing boundaries.Its an amazing journey to say the least.I can guarantee you that long time after the movie ends you'll still be thinking about it. The soundtrack is memorizing,Tom Cruise's performance is Oscar worthy and the movie was extremely well directed.I have never seen the original (Abre Los Ojos 1997) but since I enjoyed this one so much, I'm planning to.Between the coded messages, the subtle clues, the references to pop culture, the amazing story, the incredible performance by Tom Cruise, and the beautiful soundtrack, this film is a masterpiece.

"jasonford1987","10","0","1","13 May 2009"," My personal favorite movie!
","Above all else in a film, I look for emotional connectivity, and substance. There needs to be depth there. Vanilla Sky delivers like no other movie I've seen yet. It may not seem so for the first view of the film. I admit it is somewhat of a tangled bit of processes, if you will. However, it's also one of those movies - and really more than any other movie I know of - that you can watch again and again and only enjoy it more each time.<br/><br/>I still am uncertain about the true nature the film's story, though, even after watching it many times. Personally I view this as a good thing. I have little doubt that it was made so that this was the case. Is the whole film a dream that David is having during a coma? Or only the portion between the car wreck and the final image of the opened eye? Is it exactly what the film says it is? The viewer is in as much confusion as to the difference between dreams and reality as David is. The scene directly after the crash, amongst the trees is superb. The emotional twinge when David realizes it's a dream can be felt by anyone, since we all know what it's like to dream such a pleasant dream but to awaken to less.<br/><br/>The culminating elevator and roof top sequence wraps everything up wonderfully. A lot of people may be disappointed that the mysteries of the film are somewhat revealed here, but I think it is very well done in that it doesn't reveal too much, certainly not the details; instead, it reveals the core ratios that have played into the whole. Then it all concludes in that beautiful line: ""I want to live a real life. I don't want to dream any longer."" I'm not a huge Tom Cruise fan, but I definitely consider this his best work. His usual overbearing idioms are offset by the horrible disfigurement he bears through half the movie, to add even more dimension to a great performance. Kurt Russel is also superb as Dr. McCabe. I would love to see him in another like role. Finally, the soundtrack is without a doubt the best from any movie. If anything Vanilla Sky is worth watching only to feel the way the music saturates the emotional landscape.<br/><br/>In conclusion, if you're willing to be confused, willing to accept unanswered questions, and enjoy an emotionally vivid film, Vanilla Sky is a delight. It's not a lighthearted view, you must be thoughtful and ready to let the movie take you where it will. Like any good art, it's a different experience for each different viewer."
"MovieMn1982","10","0","1","11 May 2009"," A cinematic gem, and one of the best films of 2001!
","This film is a thought provoking, intelligent, and all around amazing experience. It amazes me that this was given a mainstream release by Paramount, and I only wish that they would continue to take more risks like this once in a while, because here, the payoff is beautiful. Tom Cruise delivers one of his best performances to date as David Aames, an egotistical playboy who inherited a fortune from his father, and takes everything in his life for granted, until his life suddenly takes a turn for the bizarre. This film is about one man's journey to redemption through a series of dreams, scientific miracles, and the power of love.<br/><br/>I personally believe that this is Cameron Crowe's best, after ALMOST FAMOUS. Why this film did not connect with audiences and critics is the most baffling thing for me to grasp. Cruise totally dives into this role (he also produced the film, which is based on a foreign film, ABRE LOS OJOS), and the rest of the supporting cast is perfect as well. Penelope Cruz will take your breath away with her fully realized performance as Sofia, Jason Lee is amazing as a heartbroken novelist, and Cameron Diaz gives what may be her best performance of all time as lonely, psychotic Juliana. The soundtrack is to die for, and perfectly compliments the mood of the film.<br/><br/>This is a beautiful film. It is a celebration of life, and how ""every passing minute is a chance to turn it all around"". I watched this film in theatres years ago, and it made a huge impression on me. I've watched it twice since yesterday.<br/><br/>For those of you who may be skeptical, ignore the negative reviews and watch the film for yourself. Let it wash over you. You won't regret it."

","This is a remake of a Spanish thriller film called Open Your Eyes (quoted in the film), from director Cameron Crowe (Jerry Maguire), I think I'd prefer the original to this. Basically, in what looks like a not-too-distant future, David Aames (Tom Cruise, also producing) has inherited a playboy lifestyle from his dead parents, and at a party he meets the girl his friend Brian Shelby (My Name Is Earl's Jason Lee) brought, Sofia Serrano (Razzie nominated Penélope Cruz), and he instantly falls for her. He wants to find out more about Sofia, but he is being stalked almost by jilted lover Julie Gianni (Golden Globe nominated Cameron Diaz), and she ends up crashing her car off a bridge, with David inside. While Julie died, David survived and had his face reconstructed, and not long after, he is finding it hard to distinguish between his dreams and reality. He is desperate to be with Julie, but being in an unstable condition, he is first trying to get back to reality, with the help of psychiatrist McCabe (Kurt Russell). In a ridiculous twist ending, you find out he has been dreaming for ages, because he is in fact dead, but he still has the chance to decide whether to go into a dream where he can have anything he wants and be happy, never ageing, or go back to reality and have a normal life, and thank goodness, he chooses reality. Also starring Noah Taylor as Edmund Ventura, Timothy Spall as Thomas Tipp, Tilda Swinton as Rebecca Dearborn, Alicia Witt as Libby, Johnny Galecki as Peter Brown, Conan O'Brien, and look for Steven Spielberg as a Party Guest. This film is one of the most confusing and ridiculous I have ever seen in my life, and I hope I never do again. All the actors are wasting their talents, the story is filled with material you cannot understand - in terms of story and putting on screen, and it just seems like director Crowe wasn't putting enough effort into making a good a film, which I can safely say it isn't. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Song for Paul McCartney's title song, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Song. Tom Cruise was number 32 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 25 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and he was number 81 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Pretty poor!"

","Amongst all of the other comments, I'm sure mine will get lost, but this movie is so great on so many levels, I felt I needed to underline/restate some important ideas regarding this film.<br/><br/>First, being why it wasn't widely accepted as a truly remarkable film. I think this is for a few reasons which would be: it's a remake of a Spanish film, it has Tom Cruise as the star, and the entire plot is based around sci-fi fantasy. These points are all ridiculous reasons to ignore the greatness of this film. Number one, show me a film that doesn't have some relation to some other film or book created before it. Number two, while Cruise is a weirdo, that doesn't mean he can't make good films and this is probably his best. And three, sci-fi plays with your imagination. Some people I guess like their movies all based in today's reality, which is sad. BAsically, some people don't like to think about what-ifs, only the what is. So with these notions out of the way, why is the movie so wonderful, and honestly a classic film?<br/><br/>I can't say it better than everyone else has already said it, but I'll try. The philosophical ideas brought up throughout the film, the unique plot twists and turns, and climactic ending which only ties all the loose ends together as the film ends wastes no time throughout the movie; it is only after the entire story is told, the movie ends. Now that's drama. That's story telling. With careful listening and observation, you can you detect hints throughout the movie. The whole story unfolds before your eyes as a viewer, though it's up to you how you interpret what's going on, based on what you know and don't know. This is the whole idea the movie is built around (We create our own realities), and it is played out in how the movie is filmed,directed, and told. The cinematography, the soundtrack, the acting, the plot, everything comes together to create one hell of an engrossing ride.<br/><br/>In closing, if you leave after a first viewing not understanding what happened or things didn't quite make sense, please do yourself the favor of seeing it again. If a person can't appreciate this movie, I honestly don't know what else you could be looking for in a film.<br/><br/>P.S. Some other poster said if you love Vanilla Sky, you'll probably love Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. How right he is!!! That's probably my second favorite movie behind Vanilla Sky!!"

The main problem is that young, handsome, and wealthy Tom Cruise (as David Aames)'s ""David"" is neither likable nor engagingly unlikable. Mr. Cruise has good taste in women, like precious Penélope Cruz (as Sofia) and jealous Cameron Diaz (as Julie Gianni); but, the movie isn't very sexy. Ms. Cruz played the same role in the original, sexier film (with Eduardo Noriega). Ms. Diaz and Jason Lee (as Brian Shelby) are most enjoyable, in supporting roles. Cinematographer John Toll is also outstanding.

","First of all, I have to say that this is actually not a bad movie. I even have to admit, that I found it quite amazing, after I watched it for the first time, and later for three or four other times. I also heard about the fact, that this is a remake of a Spanish movie, ""Abre los Ojos"", which has been made only four years before. But because ""Abre los Ojos"" is probably in most countries less famous than the high budget Hollywood remake, it took some time, since I saw the original movie for the first time.<br/><br/>After I did, I realized, that ""Vanilla Sky"" obviously includes some of the strong ideas of ""Abre los Ojos"" and converted them somehow nice. It actually follows the dramaturgy of ""Abre los Ojos"" almost(!!) 1:1, camera work and light is technically very good as most high budget blockbuster movies are...<br/><br/>...and at least Paul McCartney wrote and performed a quite nice song for the credits, which is worth listening at...<br/><br/>...but in my opinion, ""Vanilly Sky"" goes over the top in most stylistic subjects (e.g. music also), maybe just to challenge the original movie anyhow or - I don't know. I can not see any reason why they decided to bring in these pointless music montages and the long dialog explanation and, as I think, one-dimensional interpretation of the events for the spectator at the end by this strange character ""Ed Ventura"" (played by Noah Taylor).<br/><br/>My main point is, that ""Vanilla Sky"" missed the chance to come to any relevant or interesting conclusions about the social important subjects of media or psychology, which were part of the heart of the original script. Instead of this, director Cameron Crowe and leading role actor and co-producer Tom Cruise were looking for more metaphysical and religious aspects and changed the ending of the original movie ideologically, which is, in my opinion, much less interesting than in ""Abre los Ojos"".<br/><br/>I don't say, that a remake has to be automatically worse than the original, but it should bring in any relevant or innovative aspects, which ""Vanilly Sky"" hardly does.<br/><br/>Altogether on one hand an interesting movie, which on the other hand is not really worth to watch, if you already know the original.

Part of the issue that I have with this film is that it really fails to strongly set up (and maintain) a motivation for the protagonist to make the later decisions that he does. While it does have a really good (and different) set-up with the protagonist and his relationship to his successful late father, this gets lost as the film progresses and somewhere in the middle of the film, the protagonist suddenly picks up a rather difficult to believe motivation in ""love"", which is difficult to believe because elements of his original motivation still drive a lot of his decision-making.<br/><br/>In the end, this lack of focus on a central theme (or premise) for the film causes it to lose overall thematic coherence, lessening its impact. Director Cameron Crowe does manage to create his own unique take on the look of the film and at times it's quite impressive and unique to his own style. Another thing to note about the film is that it has a wonderful soundtrack. The film is full of great pop-rock-alt music. Unfortunately, the music hardly lets up for very long and gives the drama little room to breath. Furthermore, the mix throws the music up too much in the front and sometimes makes it hard to focus on the film. Never have I so hated the fact that such a great soundtrack was present in the film.<br/><br/>On the positive side, the players all inject their characters with interesting performances that differ from the original's characters. The work overall isn't that convincing, especially in creating a dreamlike mood for the various dreams, but that might also be my personal taste for subtlety combined with my general foreknowledge of how the plot's going to play out affecting my perception.<br/><br/>In the end, Vanilla Sky does manage to conjure up some interesting images and meditations, but falls short of being compelling. It's biggest weakness is the lack of believable character motivations and a coherent theme and premise to the story. That and the overdone soundtrack. I found Vanilla Sky to be just short of a passable watch in the end and while it might be a decent mind-trip of a film, if you want to choose between this one and the Spanish original, I highly suggest the original, a far more compelling, even if problematic, work. 5/10."
"tobers19","1","0","9","1 February 2008"," Another Hollywood rip off of a genuine masterpiece
","Those folks praising Vanilla Sky for its genius are the same folks who praise Gus van Sant for his genius film, Psycho and the same folks who think Walt Disney wrote the original stories for Pinocchio, Sleeping Beauty and Snow White. Come on, folks, let's give credit where credit is due. The only fascinating elements to Vanilla Sky are those taken from the original, Abre los Ojos. Abre los Ojos is such a fine and engaging film that I thought it would be impossible to make a horrible re-make of it. Even if Cameron Crowe re-shot this movie frame by frame, he would have an excellent film on his hands. But even he managed to muck it up. Cameron Crowe is one of the most overrated 'talents' in Hollywood. An average writer and director at best, he can only warrant praise when he's riding on the coattails of a true artist like Amenabar. Don't even bother with this schlock. Watch the original. Why Hollywood has to appropriate source material like this with impunity, I will never understand. Hollywood has done this with numerous Kurosawa films, i.e. The Magnificent Seven, The Outrage and even A Fistful of Dollars, though Leone eventually earned his place as a true master. And just about every American horror movie of the last decade has been outsourced from Japan. But for hacks like Crowe who insist on casting madmen like Cruise, the making of true art seems like a futile endeavor. Who cares about the self-congratulatory cultural references throughout the film? Most of them are from Cameron's own life...referencing his wife, his wife's work and several of his own films. Fifty years from now, all these references will be lost on a generation of viewers who could either care less or are oblivious to such allusions. It's because of lackluster filmmakers like Crowe that true art seemingly will never thrive in cinema. Just because he can recognize a good film like Jules et Jim and include some obscure reference to it in his own films doesn't mean he's in the same league as Truffaut. It enrages me that Vanilla Sky even gets a single kudo. Again, why don't we just re-make the original Star Wars and call it art? Oh yeah, Lucas already did that with Episodes 1-3. Anyways, how Cameron Crowe and Tom Cruise got to be so popular and bankable, I will never know. Why these two balloon-heads are generating mediocre film after mediocre film is almost as much a mystery as why people even watch them. Just look at Almost Famous. Cameron Crowe is rubbing it in your face that he's a wunderkind...a fifteen year old who hobnobs with rock stars and lost his virginity to a throng of insatiably hot groupies all the while trying to forge a cover story for Rolling Stone magazine. Let's try for once to reign cinema out of the hands of the aggressively mediocre and into the hands of daring artists. Until then, we'll just have to deal with unwatchable re-makes of true masterpieces and watch films that were created by accountants, lawyers and the hackneyed filmmakers they keep on the payroll."

These movie is a remake of the Spanish Amenabar film: "" Abre los ojos"", as usual, the remake is not as good as the original, but it is not bad, though. The action and the story is well told, and probably it is a little less dark (to adapt it to US market). On the other hand, neither Crowe nor Cruise are in their best moment, as Amenabar is much better than Crowe, and surprisingly, Noriega plays a better part than Tom. The movie, as a good copy, is good, but, if you happen to like it, please, go to the original version, it is much better."

The Board of Directors and others run the company, David just reaps all the benefits! The only ""check"" in David's life is the Board of Director's (the ""Seven Dwarfs"") and he resents them for this!<br/><br/>Karma - it is Karma that deals David a blow, by disfiguring him in the car crash. Disfigured, David can no longer rely on his good looks to cruise through life. Karma not only punishes David in this manner, but also gets even with David for treating Juliana in the manner that he did; and shows David how cruel superficiality can be when Sofia shows no interest in David after his face is disfigured. But even after David's accident, he can not see that his behavior had consequences. And it is his behavior that led him into the predicament that he finds himself in. He blames all of it on what he believes to be a conspiracy by the Seven Dwarfs to take control of his company. Ironically, the only real good thing we see David do before his accident, is to save the job of his family attorney (Tom), by keeping him on staff, giving him a 50% raise and ""the corner office."" This good deed is later repaid, because it is Tom who later in the story keeps the company in David's control, wresting it away from the Board of Directors. <br/><br/>Sofia is shown to be as superficial as David is. Sofia is no longer attracted to David after his accident. Though she apparently saw the opportunity for love to bloom after the initial meeting that nite of the party, since his face is disfigured, she never sees David again after leaving him at the nightclub. She does attend the 3-day ""celebration of his life"" thrown by his friend, Brian, but one would believe that this was not so much to grieve the loss of David as it was to grieve the loss of the love that could have bloomed had he not became disfigured in the accident. This type of superficiality is a concurrent theme throughout the movie, and in each instance, this superficiality ends up punishing the individual that acts in this manner. Though the movie focuses mostly on David's superficiality and the consequences of his behavior, we do see Sofia being punished as well. She rejects David after the accident because he is no longer aesthetically pleasing to the eye, yet we see that she never gets over loosing him. Because Sofia can not see David beyond the pretty face that she was attracted to, she is punished with grief and never sees David again after the nite at the nightclub. When she attends David's wake at his apartment, thrown by his friend, we see a sad and despondent Sofia.<br/><br/>If you would like to read more of my review - please visit my blog at http://danielalandogarcia.blogspot.com/ OR view my web site at www.danielalandogarcia.com"

Certainly, it was a stunning movie-at least with the first viewing. Viewers are dazzled and confused with special effects, sketchy dialogue, and a summary that fell far short of the demands of the story. Vanilla Sky was meant to function as a work of art, questioning the boundaries of dreams and reality, the wants and desires of our subconscious; but seemed to come second to its Hollywood duty: sensationalize.<br/><br/>David Aames, played by Tom Cruise, begins as a narcissistic playboy and suddenly his life is scattered in the matter of a few hours. He meets Sofia Serrano, realizes there is more to love than one-night stands, and nearly killed when his jealous friend, Julie, drives off a bridge. The story begs to follow the path of redemption of David, but suddenly careens into a science fiction thriller. The viewer is not given the chance nor time to understand the course of events: the sudden appearance (and re-disappearance) of dead Julie, the reversion to his disfigured face, and many other apparently inexplicable, incongruent events. The conclusion was lofty and dramatic, simply resolving David's character and leaving several gaping plot holes open for the viewer to fall into.<br/><br/>Although Abre Los Ojos, the original Spanish film, had less character development it felt more natural and more meaningful than Vanilla Sky. It is a film to enjoy only when one has plenty of time to absorb the deeper meanings beyond the time spent watching the film itself."

Really unbelievable shot!!! I heard they closed the shot in 3.5 hrs. Drawing the attention towards the accident that changed the life of this rich brat which made him feel incompetent in his life. His charms, smile and happiness were stolen by that single accident for which he gave himself. Another point to note  The sticker on David's car reads 2/30/01, a fictional date. On the commentary, Cameron Crowe says that it was an accident, it did make sense..the make up was sketched perfectly that how one could not face even his best friend and was wearing a mask for a party, even one would feel that in-composite. Also his love Sofia (Penelope Cruz) whom he visualizes as Julie (Cameroon Diaz) when he is in the ecstasy of making love with his girlfriend Sofia, who then turns in to Julie due to the strong subconscious mind taken over - is perfectly depicted by nice camera work! Although a lone character which brings his father's senses to him through Dr.Curtis McCabe (Kurt Russell) who wants to reveal him to the world what he went through, but Kurt Russell rides to the conclusion that he was not under any pressure but with science and its re-engineering or moreover a treatment, from Life Time a sci-balance program which makes him feel young even after 150 yrs as such  this is where the Director had to maintain his story but then takes as a tour and summarizes the climax on top of a building with a get together to prove that he has to come over his greatest fear ""Height"" and jumps! Well this is something, which the Dir could have emitted  I would rate this movie 6 out of 10 also a must see for Tom's performance."

","VANILLA SKY, in my opinion, is a thrilling, romantic, and heart-warming romantic thriller. I thought that Sofia (Penélope Cruz) and Julie (Cameron Diaz) were both very beautiful women... especially in the fancy dresses they wore at David's (Tom Cruise) party. As a matter of fact, all of the costumes were very well-designed. Also, after David's face had been disfigured, it was very hard to tell what was real and what was fake. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, ""Everyone involved in this film deserves a Golden Globe."" Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Tom Cruise, Penélope Cruz, or Cameron Diaz, I highly recommend this thrilling, romantic, and heart-warming romantic thriller, that is, if you haven't seen it."

If you're prone to miss details when they're presented in a movie, then yeah, I can see why Vanilla Sky would throw you.

","Although I never saw the original, I have read plenty of comments regarding that the original was better.<br/><br/>What bothers me about the film is that it shows the role of Tom Cruise as David, as the guy who took over his father's company. It would o been nice to see him actually showing the "" seven "" that he cared about the company.<br/><br/>My other gripe, is when David is in Sofia's house and they are drawing each other, and what do you know, they both are expert at drawing. Sofia draws an excellent caricature, and David's drawing of Sofia is great. What are the chances of a dancer and a kid who spent skateboarding in his father's office both being excellent in this field."

I guess the words that I would use to describe this movie are ""hautingly beautiful"" When the movie is over, you are left with an indescribable feeling (well I am anyway). I also think that this movie has the BEST soundtrack of any movie. I think the music definitely contributes to the surreal feeling of this movie. However, (this part will hopefully make it to the big movie execs) I was completely disappointed that my favorite songs from the film were not included on the soundtrack (Ladies and Gentlemen we are floating in space by Spiritualized, which plays as Sophie is walking in to David's Memorial; and Njosnavelin by Sigur Ros which plays as David jumps). So, anyway, I say buy this movie and watch it as much as you can."

","What is a line between dream and reality? Can we see dreams, believing them to be real? And if so, can we awake in a dream to figure out, that all around us is just an illusion, cleverly constructed by our sub conscious?<br/><br/>Those couple questions sprung in my mind after I watched Vanilla Sky. It's rather interesting movie really, but it does have very poorly written and boring beginning as a romantic drama starring Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz. Story it self turns good after the car crash. Then it really starts to examine reality if David Aames (Tomi Cruise), who gets his face mashed up, but who still manages to find love of Sofia Serrano (Cruz).<br/><br/>Cruz is great as she always is. You just gotta love that accent. Other actress deserving praise is Cameron Diaz, who play Julianne Gianni, a occasional lady friend of David. She was amazing in that part. <br/><br/>Tom Cruise became good actor after he made ""Eyes Wide Shut"" for Stanley Kubrick. That was the movie, which proved, that Cruise can act besides just being a pretty boy. That was just to say, that Cruise does helluva good role as Aames in Vanilla Sky. Could say, that he manages to keep the movie in surface.<br/><br/>Oh, and Kurt Russel does nice job as Aames's psychiatrist McCabe. <br/><br/>Now to the weak points of the movie. As I said it is partly very weakly written, especially the beginning, which is just boring and mundane. Then there is the direction of Cameron Crowe. He honestly isn't that great. He's not bad, but there are several moments in the film that could do some tightening up, I refer on the beginning here.<br/><br/>Overall a decent movie. Above average."
"dan-rox","8","0","1","5 March 2005"," Very fun ride!!!
","After watching ""Vanilla Sky"" then watching the original ""Abre Los Ojos"" or ""Open Your Eyes"", I must say I enjoyed Vanilla Sky the most. Oh, its true that it is almost frame for frame the same as the original, made in 1997, and it is also true that they even seem to have found actors that look very similar to the original cast. In fact, one is the exact same actor - Penelope Cruz. However, it does not, in my mind, take away from the fact that ""Vanilla Sky"" was very well made and i thoroughly enjoyed the trip.<br/><br/>Now, when comparing the two films I can absolutely agree that ""Vanilla Sky"" is nothing more than a photocopy - its obvious! Or is it? You see, I feel this movie IS a copy of the original in structure but certainly not form. One can shoot the same object in a different way and thereby impose a different vision to the objective viewer. That is certainly the case here.<br/><br/>I feel that though these two movies are identical, ""Vanilla Sky"" stands out in style and presentation. This always helps to immerse the viewer, if only for around 120 minutes, into the world presented on screen. However, I did very much enjoy ""Abre Los Ojos"" and I would highly recommend it to anyone. It certainly does have its own merits. Oh, but be prepared for subtitles, which I'll admit, takes me out of the moment.<br/><br/>Thanks for indulging me."

","to start i have to say that vanilla sky is one of my favourite movies. I saw this before the original movie and after i saw ""open your eyes"" i liked vanilla sky even more the reason is that for vanilla sky they took the good idea and made it better, to my mind perfect. ""open your eyes"" seemed incomplete to me, in ""vanilla sky"" the story is because of everything being good more touching, more intensive. first the acting is much better. OK, penelope was in ""open your eyes"", too, but i think of tom cruise, cameron diaz and especially Jason lee and kurt russel. in addition to the acting the whole scenery is appreciable: the opening scene or the poster of the vanilla-colored sky... you can feel that this movie got a bigger budget. at least the soundtrack is beautiful, one of the best in my opinion. ""vanilla sky"" owes ""open your eyes"" many parts of a good story: the rising action to the climax changes the movie from a love story to an exciting thriller, which ending touches every time, especially because of the fantastic music of sigur ros and the beautiful vanilla sky, which is to my mind well chosen. the painting by monet is my favourite after first seeing the movie.

But the last four movies i have seen featuring him have really change my mind, including Collateral (his best work), A Few Good Men (i know it's old but i just saw it recently), The Last Samurai, and Vanilla Sky. He really has become one of the best actors today.<br/><br/>As for the movie itself, it is filled with thrills, sex, comedy, twists, and uhh sex. Speaking of sex, it also features two extremely hot women with great supporting roles in Cameron Diaz and Penelople Cruz. The ending really made the whole film click.

It is really dark and complex. Take Arnold in that science fiction movie with Sharon Stone - the one where he doesn't even know who he is, mix it with Spellbound and the other old Gregory Peck movie where he has amnesia and the General is after him, and you have a taste of Vanilla Sky.

Throughout the film I kept asking myself is this real or just imagined? I was not sure if I was witnessing dream sequences, or if what I was watching was supposed to be what really occurred.

"panasit","Null","0","1","6 November 2004"," I had a dream about Vanilla Sky. And you were there. And you were there....
","I love it when commercials and trailers revealed nothing. I knew absolutely nothing of the plot and was excited to be fill in from the ground floor. I was ready for some mind-twisting have-to-watch-it-twice-to-get-it kind of movie; and it started out that way. However, by the middle of the movie, the plot was quickly reduced to being a high-class cliché. The production team dressed this movie up with symbolism, metaphoric dialogues, and situations far less complex than it appears. But then again, the point in the movie is to never underestimate the little things, especially the little decisions we made everyday. <br/><br/>At some level I think Mission Impossible is even deeper and less predictable. But if you are one of those people who want to see this kind of movie to boost your brain's ego, Vanilla Sky still has enough meat in it to satisfy, especially those interested in cameos and pop culture references.<br/><br/>Cameron Crowe's dialogues are as great as always. The beautiful Manhattan background helps the story by being a fantastic larger-than-life place that can only exist inside a dream, yet exists for real. And the acting is top notch (it better be, considering all the stars). So when every other thing goes right, it all boils down to the plot itself. <br/><br/>Part of the problem with the story is that dream is a cheap plot device for a psychological drama. It's too easy (and dare i even say cheesy) to put character in a situation and then tells the audience near or at the end ""it's only a dream."" That's too Wizard of Oz (which that movie could barely get away with). Sure, the plot expanded a lot more than that with questions like: why the character chose to dream, how he discovered the dream, and why things went wrong etc. But even the dressing of the surprises are all clichés (curse you evil corporation. curse you evil doctors and lawyers trying to play god. etc.) And that is quite disappointing. (this is not a spoiler by the way, because it was obvious that his reality is quite unstable from the beginning. The true question is what is the reasoning for the dreams, where it started, and where it ended, which I did not reveal... and wasn't that great).<br/><br/>Now I heard that this is a remake. I don't need to compare it with the original because... I don't care. But despite what I stated above, this movie is still enjoyable; not because of its story, but because of how it was delivered (once again, Cameron Crowe, New York, etc.). If you were afraid to pick up this movie because you think it might be too heavy, you are mistaken. The movie is as simple as Truman Show and Matrix. And if you are one of those mainstream viewers who don't like/get this kind of movie, think of this as a transition movie. It's not too complicated to be annoying, but complex enough to help you feel a little bit smart for understanding it, and why you will never watch it for a second time. 7.5/10"

","As one of the other posters noted, he wondered why he had let this movie sit on the shelf at the video store for so long without watching it. I can tell you that I did exactly that because of Tom Cruise featuring so prominently in the movie. <br/><br/>I'm not a fan of Tom Cruise, yet I think that he has done a reasonably good job in this movie and managed to portray David Aames with some sympathy and ability. I think that I would have liked to see someone-else cast in this role, yet I don't know who that would have been. In many ways the David Aames character IS Tom Cruise in terms of being an entitled young man, successful because of who he is not what he can do, and enjoying an life where he is popular and handsome - a life that most of us would love to have.<br/><br/>The movie itself is a like a lazy Sunday afternoon - slow, relaxed and slightly surreal. The pace is a refreshing change from the MTV generation movies with their fast pace and jarring, energetic cut shots that we are used to. Vanilla Sky draws you in and makes you think about what you are seeing, rather than just throwing images at you. And some of what you are seeing and hearing is beautifully thought out and put together.<br/><br/>Probably the biggest fault in my opinion is the cruicial part of the plot. The whole dreamy, romantic-love story relies on a high tech, almost sci-fi explanation. It's a jarring juxtaposition that disturbs and almost distracts from the movie and yet is very crucial because it is the only possible way to explain what has happened.<br/><br/>It is almost an art-house movie that is trying to pretend to be a Hollywood blockbuster. If you can let your guard down for a minute, feel some of the emotions and inner turmoil of the characters, and risk having to think about what you are watching for a change then you'll enjoy Vanilla Sky.<br/><br/>All in all, it is a very enjoyable film, a change from the usual Hollywood fare, that deserves to be watched more than once."

The soundtrack is Crowe's finest to date. Crowe's direction, his screenplay, Cruise's lead acting, Cameron Diaz's supporting performance, and the photography all deserved Academy Award recognition. The fact that some viewers had trouble following the story leads me to conclude that this type of film is not to the greater public's liking. Nobody wants to concentrate on the details of every movie instead of enjoying the movie as a whole; however, I found the direction and storytelling in ""Vanilla Sky"" just as hypnotic and beautiful as Quentin Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"" and David Lynch's ""Wild at Heart"". It's not hard to follow at all, if you feel your way through it. Viewing the film, I noticed the vanilla sky instantly (along with the sudden change in Sophia's attitude), and I realized there was something hidden...a mystery. I feel it is superior storytelling and direction. The chaotic episodes that occupy the film are David's perceptions of a world he cannot control. He loses his dignity by denying Julianna's feelings, and then he pays for it (with his good looks) when she drives him off a bridge. He suffers in pain, just like the pain he has caused. Later, when he tries to enjoy a second chance with Sophia through a lucid dream, his badly soiled conscience causes a malfunction. The movie ends with David getting a real second chance at life, a chance to take what he has learned from his mistakes, and apply it in a world, without Sophia, where he is constantly reminded that ""the sweet is just not as sweet without the sour""."

For example, the scene where he finds out he's dead and frozen is accompanied by ""good vibrations"" by the beach boys; and the scene where he kills his girlfriend uses ""what if god was one of us"". What is that? Moments like these are numerous and completely ruin the impact that those scenes could have had. <br/><br/>However, the ending of this movie was very good.

He did well but it certainly isn't the one they'll be talking about when he dies (which would be Top Gun and Eyes Wide Shut). Since Kurt Russell wasn't in it for very long at all I did find it hard to make a decision as to whether he did well or not but considering he came in and tried to explain everything yet I was still wondering what was happening I'm going to say it was nothing memorable.

","This movie is amazing. Whoever wrote that summary on the main page for Vanilla Sky only watched it once. He saw what I saw the first time I watched it. After you watch it so many times, it finally just clicks. Why would somebody think that it's only about him getting in a wreck, being disfigured, and the surgery changing him? That's the surface. Wait, it's not even the surface. The storyline isn't even based on that. David Aames found love in Sophia in one night. He got in the car with Julie, she committed suicide by driving off of a bridge, because she knew that he didn't love her back like she loved him. After that he was disfigured and suffered bad headaches. He isolated himself from the world. He went to find someone he trusted...Sophia. He didn't even really know her in his real life, but while he was lying on the ground hung over, he gave himself to Life Extension. He woke up in a world that he made (Lucid Dream). The doctors found a surgery to make his face perfect again. His headaches went away. He and Sophia were in love, and she was his world. The sky in his dream was the same sky that Monet painted in ""Vanilla Sky"" (the piece of artwork that was his mothers from the beginning that Sophia liked in his house on the night of his party). When David stopped taking control of his life, his dream became a nightmare. Tech Support from L.E. showed up many times trying to warn him. Regardless, he killed Sophia. His loss of control made Sophia Julie, he beat her and then killed her only realizing afterwards it was really Sophia. The man who interviewed him for his case was his father figure. He got the ideas of Sophia's love and that man's father figure from television in his real life. Once he realized this, and that none of them were really real, he chose to live in the real world 150 years after his true death (suicide to give himself to L.E.). The movie ends with someone saying ""open your eyes."" I haven't figured out who's saying that. I know it isn't Julie or Sophia. Maybe we're not supposed to know. But anyway, this movie is amazing. If I watch it again, I'm sure that I will see something I missed or look at it differently, but this is how I interpret this movie. I just know for a fact that there is more to it than the summary given.. <br/><br/>..the little things, there's nothing bigger is there?"

","I had started watching this movie some time ago and found it a bit too slow and boring in the first 15 minutes or so. I didn't have time to finish watching it back then, and several months later, I finally got around to watching it.. and I'm glad I did. I think the reason why I ended up appreciating it, is probably because I expected to really hate it.. when you expect the worst, the final outcome usually turns out to be not all that bad. But if you expect too much, the opposite tends to be true, (in my case anyway.)<br/><br/>I have only watched this movie once and didn't find it all that difficult to grasp. It seems there are a lot of people expect movies to only be entertaining/relaxing by allowing you to be near brain-dead without having difficult to follow the story line. American Beauty even seemed to be confusing for some, while crystal clear for me the first time around.<br/><br/>*** SPOILER ALERT *** Same with this one.. I didn't know he had been frozen and all (is it even possible to assume this until the very end when it's spelled out?).. and neither did I notice anything else weird like the logo on the mustang missing (I'll have to watch for it next time), but I did clearly notice that the clouds in the sky were oddly pink.. (not hard to miss was it? It looked too gay for this movie, like cotton candy) and he fell down drunk on a rained down street and woke up all dry. Puddles of rain water doesn't evaporate during a cold night like that.<br/><br/>So, the clue at the end made sense (putting the technical imperfections aside.. if I have to look at movies by judging the technical consistencies, I can't remember any sci-fi movie passing)... Up until the very last second where you hear ""open your eyes"" again.<br/><br/>I read the first 50 or so reviews on here trying to find someone who figured this out or gave their personal take on it. But nobody does.. in fact, only a very few even mention that ending at all.. when in fact, to me it seems like the real 'conclusion' of this movie... yes, this whole concept of waking up to find out it was all a dream (I wrote my first story this way too, for school, when I was 12 or so.. cheap suspense.. like a poor excuse for all your inconsistencies in your movie).<br/><br/>You know, I can come up with some theories of my own, and people here seem to think that makes a good movie.. crap.. This is the same excuse as some self-proclaimed artist splatters paint in a canvas and calls it art because you can ""imagine"" human faces in the blobs of colors and shapes.<br/><br/>I for one do not intend to give any artist any credit for what *I* imagine, and not for what they intended.. so my question is about what the artist/director really intended ... not what I make of it.. (the one who saw all the parallels with religion in this one blew my mind.. Sure, I can find a lot of parallels with a lot of things.. especially paranoid people are good at this, they can relate things in ways that makes perfect sense to them and they've found ways to make ends meet in their own head.. but I am certain this is not what the director intended.. though obviously we all grow up being influenced by such stories and concepts.. and as such it influences our imaginations.. symbolism sucks.. it least too much up for one's own imagination and it creates too much inconsistencies. No wonder so many can't make sense of real life anymore ;-)).<br/><br/>My theory right now is that it seems that Julie too got frozen and unfronzen or something, but that would just be silly.. Who decided to unfreeze her? If she unfroze too soon, how long would she have had to wait around for David (Cruise) to decide to be unfrozen too? So that's where that likelihood of that explanation ends for me.<br/><br/>Besides, my take on it was that he never cared much for Julie and I don't think regret and sympathy is a good basis for a relationship.. and he does wake up at the very end hearing Julie's voice saying ""open your eyes"" ... or is it Sofia's voice? I can't tell.<br/><br/>But I do know that the movie started out with Sofia's voice saying ""Open your eyes"" (after some other noise that sounded more like coming from the movie exorcist or something..)and slowly changing.<br/><br/>But we heard Sofia's voice saying ""open your eyes"" (before it morphs into Julie's voice) at the very beginning of the movie.. Must we conclude from this that the beginning of the movie is actually the end of the movie? I mean, the beginning suggest Sofia is already in the picture when in the story itself she isn't yet.. But at the end he is told by LE tech support that if he returns to normal life, he will forget all that happened during his frozen time, including that very discussion on that rooftop..<br/><br/>So does this boil down to this circular joke.. where we question how many times he's been through this very same thing? Sounds like a hindu thing where you keep reincarnating until you right all your wrongs.. before you can leave life forgood (for heaven).<br/><br/>I do not intend to watch this movie again.. because I doubt it will give me answers to all these questions I collected the first time around.<br/><br/>Anyway, whoever thinks they can explain the very ending to me where he hears ""open your eyes"" again, can e-mail me.<br/><br/>Fonz"

","this film was very good. i hope i could see the original. the story was absolutely solid, there were no wholes in it. everything was explained. What i really liked about it is cruise was a man who was unable to face reality because of the consequence of his actions. he tries to blame everyone for his troubles. Even when he gets the perfect dream life, his fears and guilty subconscious gets to him and disturbs his life. it really is all on his mind.   i love the last scene. it was very powerful. he finally knows what he wants. he know the consequences of his actions and is able to choose wisely. to finally face the unknown where it won't be easy anymore because he's 100 years into the future, but that's reality and finally he can face it again. a second chance to do it right. <br/><br/>  this film was very real. the only problem might be that in some scenes it was kind of awkward and boring. but all in all one of the most real and powerful movies."

","do not read on if you have not seen the movie. it gives away too much.<br/><br/>i really enjoyed the film. i first saw it over two years ago and it remained somewhere at the back of my mind, tugging at me. i recently decided to buy the DVD and have since watched it several times - occasionally with stop frame or close caption for assistance. my appreciation for the film has grown during the recent period of viewing / study. <br/><br/>it's a love story that transcends dimension. ""i'll find you again"" the dream version of sofia says to David. here is the notion that love might transcend the limits /confines of one's own mind and actually form a connection between lovers. this is essentially David talking to himself, his internalized sofia also tells him that ""it's a problem"" because she really is not there (she's dead and he's frozen, dreaming all of this). yet the yearning to make such a connection across impossible ontological boundaries is what our fantasies of true love always tell us. (in a Jungian sense, this is possible, we are all connected through the fabric of the collective mind [by the way, the book sitting on the table when mccabe is talking to David is ""memories, dreams, reflections"", Carl Jung's autobiography!]) (I also think that the recent movie, ""eternal sunshine of the spotless mind"" plays with this theme as well). love must try to find a way through the impossible labyrinth of mind and the reality it presumes to know. along with this, one's very own identity / existence is called into question and the adventure of finding love becomes tantamount to finding oneself.<br/><br/>mccabe gently scolds David for being ""careless"" with julianna. indeed, it is David's guilt which is the ""glitch"" or bug in the system. it is what derails what should have been paradise, it's the evil seed, the apple. the ""sweet and sour"" speech is replayed throughout the dream as a leitmotif with a simple lesson to be memorized and not forgotten; an opportunity to not make the same mistakes over again. yes. the little things can embody the meaning of the whole if one has the faith, the determination and the heart to keep up with the ""search"" - even when it is not exactly clear what it is that is missing. <br/><br/>i also want to mention that the musical tracks which support and interweave this movie are wonderful. the sigur ros track ""njosnavelin"" is haunting, sad and ethereal. and i never imagined the beach boys ""good vibrations"" in quite such a context before. i think the choices for the soundtrack were really artful and inspired."

","The first time I saw 'Vanilla Sky' I found it a combination of exciting and mind boggling. But this is a movie that needs to be seen more than once. With a repeat viewing when you are not caught up in the feeling of ""what is happening"" you can see the powerful message the movie is putting across. After watching 'Vanilla Sky' I rented the original Spanish version and I think it is unfair to compare the two because they are very different movies aiming for different end results. Cameron Crowe has taken the story of the original and made his own movie, and in my mind it works far better than any other attempts at crossing Sci-fi with a love story that I have seen (for example: 'Solaris' and 'The Butterfly effect'). It is definitely a movie that brings out strong reactions, you will love or hate it - and isn't that the best kind of movie?"

","I thought vanilla sky was brilliant. we have so many videos and DVDs at home, and I've watched them dozens of times. When we do rent some I usually can't be bothered. But Tom cruise will always get me away from the computer. This review does contain spoilers.<br/><br/>To sit and watch a film with so many twists and turns was a real treat. It deals with relationships and taking friendships for granted. Using friends for your own pleasures, for them to only haunt you later. David ( Tom cruise) thought he had everything, his own business good looks and flounce hair as well as a women who thought that to get David to love her she must give him fantastic sex. He thinking that sex with his friend Julie doesn't change the relationship. But once friends have sex they then become lovers.<br/><br/>Jealousy bitterness ensue and his life changes. With Julie neatly out of the way which scars him for the foreseeable future, From here you think we have a happy ending with David and his love Sofia. Only life doesn't run smoothly and you think his having a mental breakdown or someone is playing dirty tricks. There is a clue through the whole film but you have to take notice of everything to see it. My mind was nearly in Knots but just watch and listen. The twist at the end does make you think about reality and what if? But I'm a romantic at heart, as well as an adventurer at heart. The film made you want to be him and see what time changes."

"wainot","6","0","1","12 July 2004"," I wanted to like this movie, but ...
","I just saw this on dvd. This was a movie that I wanted to embrace, but just could not.  To back up for a moment, I never saw the Spanish language film on which it was based, Abre Los Ojos.  So, whether that film was far superior, about the same, or somehow not as good, is irrelevant - for this purpose.<br/><br/>The performances were fair to good - Cruise is a reliably good actor - this represents a solid performance.  Cameron Diaz was pretty good, Jason Lee did fine, but Penelope Cruz's acting (now, at times she looked gorgeous, and watching her dance is a pleasure) left something to be desired.  My guess (judging from this and Captain Correlli's Mandolin)is that she is much better, and much more natural in Spanish language films.  But, even w/ a great performance by her, this film would not be very good.<br/><br/>I believe the set-up is ok, and some of the ideas expressed are pretty good, but the story is somehow a little bit self-important or trying too hard to say something or to provide twists.  I don't believe this is Cameron Crowe's best work at all.  I liked Almost Famous a lot, and actually think Jerry Maguire was one of the superb works of the 90's.  Look at Crowe's writing, and the performances from everyone in the JM cast-- almost, a perfect mix of dramatic tension and comedy).  And, I know that this is a different style film, but I felt that the music (he does have good taste in music) was a substitute for memorable dialogue or pacing -- it just felt like a bad montage of music videos.  The movie repeats lines of dialogue as if they are the most clever things ever written, but they're just ok.  And then, the movie has, in my opinion, the nerve to steal a scene and the wonderful score from To Kill A Mockingbird (off a flimsy pretext), when Vanilla Sky couldn't ""carry Mockingbird's jock"", so to speak...Anyway, this film just seemed too self-conscious and too derivative of other films to really go anywhere.  Not a terrible flick, but for me about a 6.5 out of 10."

","Vanilla Sky still is one of the better movies I've seen in recent years. I will note for the record that I have not seen ""Abre Los Ojos,"" but I think I'm going to check it out after this<br/><br/>There are several reasons I enjoy this movie. One, the acting. Yes, the acting. I'm sorry, but Tom Cruise actually does a very good job in this movie. Cruise is not a great actor in general, but he's seems perfectly suited for the David Aames role (draw whatever conclusions you want about Tom from that.) and does a very good job in what is by far his best performance to date. Penelope Cruz is very charming as Sofia Serrano because she's basically the antithesis of David Aames, but plays it in a very warm and cute way. Kurt Russell, Cameron Diaz, Jason Lee, Timothy Spall, and Noah Taylor are all worth mentioning. It is an outstanding supporting cast.<br/><br/>The greatest asset of the movie is the music. From Nancy Wilson's score to the songs chosen, it is flawless. Cameron Crowe uses the music of this film not just to set mood, but as a story telling device which works very well.<br/><br/>This is definitely a movie that needs to be watched twice. Once to learn the story, and once (or more times if you like it) to pick up on the detail. Some feel that Cameron babies the audience being to obvious with he clues in this mystery, but I think the fact that there are four legitimate interpretations (according to Cameron on the DVD commentary) means that the audience is given a chance to fill in blanks with their imagination.<br/><br/>There is a pocket of negative reaction that swirls around this film and I want to address that. First, much of it comes from people who saw and loved Abre Los Ojos. This is expected. If you've seen Abre Los Ojos before Vanilla Sky, I don't fault you for not liking Vanilla Sky. 99% of remakes never live up to the original in the viewer's mind. I myself have not seem ALO. Second, there is a certain number of people who just dislike Tom Cruise. Understandable to an extent, but try to go into a movie with an open mind. Third, I think some people went into this thinking, ""Feel-good, romantic comedy with some action spliced in"" and came out completely surprised by what this movie really jumped in to. This is the fault of Crowe and the marketing. Unless you saw ALO and knew this was a remake, it's understandable how some people were disappointed. Fourth, it's a movie that takes some time. Not everyone wants that. Many want instant gratification.<br/><br/>All told, I like this movie very much. The music's incredible, the acting is very good. 9 out of 10 is my rating. Both those who like Vanilla Sky and those who were disappointed with the fact that Cameron has his Edmund Ventura character explain much of the plot at the end would do well in checking out Donnie Darko, a somewhat similar movie in genre with much more subtlety. Still, Vanilla Sky deserves it's due as a good movie."

","This is perhaps one of the most underrated films of recent years. Open your eyes (the original) has the reputation for being superior in every way. However i do not think this is justified at all, in fact my opinion is the exact opposite. When i saw Vanilla Sky for the first time, i was completely unaware of the story, and the ending left me feeling inspired. However after recently seeing Open Your Eyes, i found that too much of the ending was given away towards the beginning. Even Tom Cruise is excellent in this film. The ending reaches such an amazing epiphany that the film is one of the most emotionally devastating that i have ever seen. i would highly recommend this film to anyone, the beginning may go on a bit but stick with it and you won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>(Also worth seeing to see Jason Lee)"

","On the bright side, Cameron Crowe can take solace in the fact that thanks to Rush Hour 2, Tomb Raider, and Swordfish, Vanilla Sky is safe from being the worst film of its year. I am a big fan of Cameron Crowe and intrigued by Paul McCartney's title song, I thought this could be good but I was let down. The film stars Tom Cruise as...um, I don't remember the guy's name but it's really not important, Tom Cruise basically plays the same guy he always plays. The chief characteristics of the basic Tom Cruise character is he's 1) God's gift to women 2) Bold and very confident and 3) Has a chip on his shoulder, often something to do with a deceased father figure. Given the right plot, Tom Cruise can usually work well because the character progresses and usually brings the cockiness down to Earth while overcoming that chip on his shoulder, and we often root for him through the whole process because of attribute #1, woman find him good-looking and guys generally think he's pretty cool. <br/><br/>       The problem is that there really isn't much of a plot here, so the movie is just on pretty faulty ground with Cruise as the protagonist, and the film eventually falls flat. The movie starts out pretty normal, Cruise wakes up next to Cameron Diaz, a friend who sleeps with him, and goes to work as a business executive, where has to deal with the board that co-owns the company and don't think that Cruise is as qualified as the company's former owner, his father (that's attribute #3). Cruise than goes to a party and falls in love with Penelope Cruz, who's not as easy to get into bed as Cameron Diaz. Yes, Cruise forms a solid friendship with her and is enthusiastic about meeting her cause, as I said he's in love. Then, Cruise is driving around with Cameron Diaz and she bursts with rage over being used by him, and she drives the car over a bridge. Yep, that kind of threw you for a loop, if you were hearing about the storyline for the first time, didn't it? <br/><br/>        The real plot kind of gets underway here, but as I said, it's not much of a plot, at least in my opinion. Tom Cruise survives the crash but he's pretty badly injured, that's about the basics. Past that, things are going on in the storyline but not in any real discernable order, and reality just kind of becomes blurred. I won't give away too much, but if you stick with the movie, towards the end, things got a little easier to figure out. However, there's a lot of screentime here, where nothing's really even that easy to understand or that watchable. Also, the film has a sort of dark and depressing tone, and since the darkness didn't really serve any function, i thought that brought down the movie. <br/><br/>      One of the bright spots of the movie, however, was Penelope Cruz. She really lit up the screen and it was easy to see why Tom Cruise was falling in love with her. <br/><br/>      Past that, the other characters serve little purpose. Cameron Diaz is basically there to hammer in attribute #1 of Cruise's character, because she's very hot herself and her willingness to have sex with him without strings just so she can get closer to him. It makes her a really degrading person, but it makes it easier for Cruise to convince us that his character in this movie is God's gift to women. Jason Lee plays Cruise's best friend and helps develop attribute #2, Cruise's confidence. Because Lee's a complete pushover and clearly is the more subservient one in their friendship, considering how he give up Penelope Cruise for her, how could Cruise not be confident?             In short, this was an admirable experiment for Cameron Crowe, I still like his stuff, I even liked some of his small touches, but a lot of the things in the movie just didn't work at all for me."
"long_christopher","Null","0","1","8 April 2004"," Memory Refraction
","Vanilla Sky examines the human psyche and how memory can become distorted. David Aames (Tom Cruise), a rich playboy, is involved in a car accident which leaves his face badly disfigured and in order to conceal his injuries he wears a mask.  However he finds himself unable to remember clearly the events surrounding the accident, and so his mental state forms the basis of the film's narrative.<br/><br/>The film's narrative takes place in two time frames.  The first is in the present where he relates his memory of events to a psychiatrist.  The second takes place in flash-backs with David's voice-over narrating these events. The film is predominantly shot using wide angles, thereby distancing the audience from the action and introducing a voyeuristic element to the film.<br/><br/>The mask represents two sides to his personality.  With the mask on, David is losing control.  With the mask off, he is confrontational.  He gets drunk which in itself is symbolic of a loss of control and this symbolism is reinforced by the mask being moved to behind his head.  His confrontational side is illustrated in a scene when after some drinks he removes the mask and challenges the barman to comment on his disfigurement. Therefore both sides of his personality become visually represented.<br/><br/>The music used in the film helps to propel the narrative and gives an insight into David's confusion.  This confusion is signified by the lyrics of R.E.M's, 'Sweetness Follows'. An example of David's loss of control is the line, ""it's these little things, they can pull you under.""  In such circumstances as David finds himself in, every little insecurity is magnified.  Furthermore, the line, ""readying to bury your father and your mother"" symbolises the loss of security, a security that a parent would give to their child.<br/><br/>In my opinion, David's disfigurement was minor and would not disturb anybody who would see it.  This is in keeping with Hollywood portrayals of disfigurements as film makers such as Cameron Crowe can not afford to portray stars being seriously hurt and risk losing audiences.<br/><br/>In addition, I felt the acting of Tom Cruise to be rather wooden, an opinion which also applies to the majority of the cast.  However, the film did not need strong acting performances as the plot and it's thought provoking content was the over-riding element. Therefore, the acting performances did not hold as much significance as they do in other films.<br/><br/>Vanilla Sky is reminiscent of Christopher Nolan's 'Memento' in which the audience are made to empathise with the main character in his struggle to distinguish the difference between fact and fiction.  Other examples are David Fincher's 'The Game' and in David Cronenberg's 'eXistenZ'.<br/><br/>Overall, I thought that Vanilla Sky contended some interesting questions about how memory can become unreliable without the person realising and therefore blurring the line between fact and fiction. When does reality stop and imagination begin?<br/><br/>6/10"

","This had to be the most head blag movie of my life but a thoroughly enjoyable one.  I had no idea that Vanilla Sky had a story line like this. I heard about it but when I saw Cameron Crowe was the director I just passed it off for a new romantic comedy like in Jerry Maguire, but came in for a shock.  I got the chance to see it not long after it came out of the cinema and really got into it.  A lot say the plot runs to slow and doesn't go anywhere for a least the first quarter of the movie which seems to go on endlessly but if you want to get to know each one of the characters and sympathise them then you need a lot of characterisation to start you off which is what happens.  Then bang Cameron Diaz goes crazy and drives her car with Cruise in the passenger seat off a bridge killing herself and physically destroying Cruise's face. Head F**k begins and doesn't let go. When watching it I had to stop in parts as it became all to much for me to take in so I stopped to think about parts.  I am not to good with films like these and can be quite slow on the uptake but when it comes together it turns out to be one of the most romantic films ever made even if it comes across a bit violent at times.   <br/><br/>If not the best romantic then definitely love story as you just want David and Sofia to be happy.  Cruise plays a role of his career as it is so different to everything else he has done as far as storytelling goes. Penelope Cruz is alright and could imagine a dozen other lead actresses taking her part and making it much the same as hers but I loved Jason Lee in this.  I thought his friendship between him and Cruise was utterly believable.  I didn't really get Kurt Russell as this is also a different film for him but not a  bad one at all.  Cameron Diaz was great as the psycho bitch Julie.  The film doesn't really belong to anybody as there are top notch performances all round and the directing from Cameron Crowe is great.  Al I have to now is to see the original film Open Your Eyes from which this film is from as remake and to see whether it is better?"

","I watch hundreds of movies every year.  Even though I saw Vanilla Sky in 2001 after the initial release, Vanilla Sky has only recently become one of my favorites of all time!  I have never before cried with tears rolling down my face in my decades of movie going - I have had my eyes water, but have never been moved to the point of actually crying out loud with tears until I saw this movie for the third time.  I am retired from the U.S. Marine Corps, so I was embarrassed as hell, trying to hide my tears from my wife.<br/><br/>The first time I saw Vanilla Sky in the theater, I was not significantly impressed, I enjoyed the movie and I felt that I understood the story, but there was no real impact upon me when compared with other films I have watched.  At the time I would not have even considered the film among my favorites. The first time you watch this movie, you may even be a little confused or disappointed.  The first time is not a loss though as the actors are beautiful in all aspects.  If you have not seen Vanilla Sky, during your first viewing keep in mind that the movie is far deeper than what you may understand or grasp in that first viewing alone.  Just enjoy watching the film; do not try to figure anything out.  I really think of the first viewing of this movie as more of an introduction - don't try to judge the film upon this first view; just watch.  Maybe this is why Vanilla Sky did not receive the best of reviews.  How many times does a movie reviewer watch a film before writing, once or twice at the most?<br/><br/>Vanilla Sky is like work of art, upon first glance you may find the film distasteful, but with further study you begin to see the magnificence of the work and are moved.  The more you watch, the more you may appreciate and cherish.  The film has a depth and longevity that a typical blockbuster-type movie does not.  This appreciation of the movie has to be developed over several viewings; this quality likely came at a severe sacrifice to box office sales and initial reviews.  I am sure that most of the success of this movie at the box office was carried upon the shoulders of the famous actors and director involved.  But, this is a perfect movie to own on DVD because you will enjoy watching the film again and again and with each viewing you may discover something new.  After watching Vanilla Sky several times, you begin to notice the intricate details woven within the story. There are many powerful themes to be discovered in Vanilla Sky.  The most appreciated things in life do not come to us easily, don't watch this movie just once, you will never appreciate the greatness of the film."
"GuitarMusician84","Null","0","1","29 March 2004"," Excellent film; watch if you like complex story more than cheesy action.
","Understand first off that I truly enjoyed this movie,enough to go to Blockbuster Video to buy it(I work at Hollywood Video). I really liked the fact that it was very different from Tom Cruise's other movies, probably because of director Cameron Crowe, but still, i cant think of anyone else that could have played the part. (I had considered Jeremy Davies [Million Dollar Hotel, 29 Palms]because he is one of those under-recognized actors that can naturally play unorthodox and strange characters and still make the character seem normal and yet a little off.)Tom Cruise was, I thought fine for the part, namely because, along with frustration and confusion, Cruise always has a natural confidence that matches perfectly for the arrogant rich boy he plays. Overall, I sincerely wanted to thank Crowe for directing an exciting and surreal film. It goes without saying I think, that the actors, even Cruise and Penelope Cruz, did a fine job and should be proud.<br/><br/>In my one line summary, i mentioned that one should watch this if they like story more than action, they should watch this film... let me elaborate please, you see, I am a film major in college and as said, i also work in a video rental place. So it's rather obvious that i have access to alot of movies. I want to say that there are plenty of good action movies that have story plot to them. I make no mention of these. You see, I've grown tired of movies where the main point of focus of the film is on the action rather than on the structure of the story. They have a simple plot revolving on one or a few characters who are capable somehow of defeating odds that are against them by using some long forgotten knowledge of Kung Fu and/or fighting.( EXPLOSIONS PREVELENT THROUGHOUT MOVIE) Not that these are always bad, and i am certainly not saying that i don't watch these sometimes, i just find it refreshing and much more appealing when I find a film that goes deeply into strange events and develops a story that is truly remarkable in that respect. So yes, i say that if one enjoys story and unexpected twists more so than firey car chases and overdone gun battles, please give this film a chance."

","Really, I would love to say that this film blew me away to an unmeasurable height. It was a treat, to say the least, and it did offer entertainment. However, as many pros I can say about this movie, I can also mention cons. The movie has some quality grade A actors and actresses, but it seems the performances they play are week at best. The story is hardly simple, a man who vows to never fall in love does, but of course once he does it upsets his Ex and she drives him off a bridge severely disfiguring his face. Sounds interesting, and the execution is descent enough to keep you watching. Towards the end though, everything changes. And I mean everything, the nice Romance turns into a bizarre horror story from hell. That is all this movie ends up being, and unfortunately, the ending makes you even angrier. Hardly, if I do say so myself, a good twist. It seemed more or less like the entire movie revolved around this ""twist"" and the depth leading up to it was shallow. A descent movie, to say the least, but hardly my favorite scoop of ice cream.<br/><br/>6.5/10 Pros: Good first half, some funny moments, cool scene at the dance room, very quotable<br/><br/>Cons: To many twists and turns in what could have been a good film, low quality acting, <br/><br/>I recommend watching this film, but don't go in expecting a masterpiece. It is descent, but hardly the greatest film I have ever seen"

If you are tired of being able to easily predict movies, you will love this one.  I think most who do not like this movie are the ones who cannot understand it and are not DEEP enough to wade through.  I like movies that make you think, action but realism with plot development or movies that make you look at something in a new light but still provide realism and Vanilla Sky did all of this and more.  Its not a chick flick but it will make you feel romantic, its not a drama but it will leave you thinking of conflicts.  Its not an action movie as there are no guns or action in that sense, but it has action (in a different form) and it has an interesting futuristic artistic sense about it.  Images and flashback with combinations of sights and sounds.<br/><br/>Watch it - the ones who rated this movie below an 8, usually don't do much thinking and like the static plots, of shoot em up movies and the regular garbage.  I like these movies below... so if you like the movies i mention you will definately like Vanilla sky.<br/><br/>Braveheart - Matrix - Snatch - Fight club - trainspotting - Fear and loathing in las vegas - Bowling for columbine - animatrix - american history x - life or something like it - oh brother where art thou.<br/><br/>If you like those, you will add Vanilla Sky to your list"

","I was sorely disappointed when I saw this film two and a half years ago.  I actually went to the theater to see this.  I'm so glad I wasn't the one paying.  I love Cameron Crowe and I think he is a very talented writer/director, but this is one of the worst pieces of film in the history of cinema.  I couldn't believe it.  And it's really ironic, I would have to say that it's my least favorite movie of all time (that and 28 days later...that I did pay to see, big mistake!), and Noah Taylor is in this, yet he's also in my all time favorite movie, The Year My Voice Broke.  Tom Cruise was very good, and so were all of the actors and actresses, that I did not have a problem with.  To be honest most of the movie I don't even remember, it confused me then, and to think back on it now, I can't even put it together.  When I went to see it, after it was over, a lady sitting next to me and the person I was with asked, ""Did you understand what just happened?  'Cause I sure didn't."" Yea, it was a real mind-numbing experience.  And towards the end of the film, just when I thought I knew what was going on, they mixed everything up, and I was lost again. Random sex scenes, that didn't make any sense, and confusing dialogue, coincided with a really slow beginning. I hated this movie, and it's no exaggeration. But if you really want to see a bad movie, you should check it out.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 2 out of 10 for effort, and that's being kind.<br/><br/>That's the end of my review."

"surfandski","8","0","1","17 January 2004"," A great cast deliver an excellent story in top form.
","Vanilla Sky is an excellent adaptation of the Spanish film Abre los Ojos (open your eyes, which I have also seen). What Vanilla Sky has over the original is excellent performances from all its cast members. Along with Magnolia, this is probably Tom Cruise best performance, I am not a great fan of his commercial work, but you have to respect the man here. His facial expressions are a joy to watch in every shot, it is a great, underrated performance, like George Clooney's performance in Solaris. Cameron Diaz also shines as the 'villain'. I agree with a reviewer here which says that the music was distracting, even though the soundtrack is excellent, it is not appropriate, it seems as if Crowe is trying to make a video of every sequence. However do not let this minor issue stop you from seeing this movie. One of the great things about Vanilla Sky is that although the movie may seem confusing to some, everything is brought together at the end WITHOUT CHEATING. Many movies nowadays tend to get away from a straight narrative, nothing wrong with that, but with a script so full of holes that you could not put it together even with crazy glue, using the BS excuse that they will 'leave it up to the viewer to figure out what they really mean' or 'if you look carefully, it is all there'. Not here. In short, a great surprise from a movie I was not expecting much. 8/10"

Since I missed the last 30 minutes of it (I fell asleep.), I ended up disliking it because it confused me.  Then I saw it a year later in its entirety by finally seeing the ending and realizing how everything ties up...I was fascinated.<br/><br/>If I used one word to name the theme of this movie, I would use the word: CHOICES.  David makes choices in this movie that alter it from beginning to end within his real life and his lucid dreams.  In applying to my life, I would learn that we should always (that means AT EVERY MOMENT) make choices that help others, that do not smack of any self-service/self-ambition, and that benefit the good of others.

"Jamie-58","9","0","1","1 January 2004"," Improves with age
","Many short sighted critics dismissed Vanilla Sky as the ultimate vanity project, a plea for acceptance by a middle aged superstar. That they underrated the film in the process is not necessarily their fault. Vanilla Sky gains immeasurably from repeat viewings, and what at first seems incoherent and muddled emerges as stylish and frequently very moving.<br/><br/>In a way its a companion piece to David Lynch's Mulholland Drive, and all that is missing is a director of Lynch's bravado. Cameron Crowe tries hard, but his approach is just a shade too literal for the abstract goings on with this film. Reticence is also on show in the denoument which is too drawn out and overdone - every loose thread has to be sewn up, which is a pity.<br/><br/>
But the good vastly outweighs the bad. The performances are outstanding. Cameron Diaz is a creepily effective villain/victim, and Penelope Cruz carries off the idealised and waifish Sofia with a rare skill. (I have read that the role was intended for Nicole Kidman, but she would have lacked the straight forward simplicity of Cruz.)<br/><br/>And carrying the whole thing effortlessly as ever is Tom Cruise. What a star he is! He rarely rests on his laurels, and throughout there is a pronounced intellect at work in his performances. People who sneered at the film as a vehicle for Cruise to emote and vent his demons are missing the point. The film indeed has much to tell us, both pro and con, about celebrity and its attendant baggage - and frankly I can think of far worse ways of killing a few hours than watching Mr Cruise work his way through those issues. There are few people as qualified to do so.<br/><br/>If its a vanity project, that's not to its detriment. Would that all vanity projects were as good as this one."
"tfrizzell","Null","0","5","29 December 2003"," Thick Smog and Fog Ahead.
","Long, winding and ultimately pretentious and empty dud from director Cameron Crowe has New York publishing giant Tom Cruise recanting some odd events that took place just prior and after his 33rd birthday. Cruise, disfigured and imprisoned, tells a confusing story of lust and possibly love to prison psychiatrist Kurt Russell. It seems that lover Cameron Diaz snapped after finding out that Cruise was seeing new interest Penelope Cruz. A wild car ride for Cruise and Diaz would follow, but then everything after that is a gigantic fog of oddball situations and stranger outcomes (ala Stanley Kubrick's much better ""Eyes Wide Shut""). In the flashbacks we see Cruise's best friend (Jason Lee) and a strange ghostly character that keeps on popping up all over the place (scene-stealer Noah Taylor). Soon Cruise's reality and dreams mix into a whacked jumble where nothing is what it seems and eventually even the Cruz and Diaz characters seem to show similarities. 2001 was definitely the year for strange experiences at the movie house with ""Mulholland Dr."" and ""Memento"". ""Vanilla Sky"" would like to be in the same category as those masterpieces, but ends up falling flat. The screenplay is all over the place and the resolution is predictable, unsatisfying and even a bit dumb. Cruise and Cruz have no chemistry at all in this film. They may be right for one another in real life, but they stink it up together on the silver screen (Cruise and former wife Nicole Kidman were so good together in movies). Diaz is strong, but is not around near enough to have the impact needed. The movie wants you to think, but by the end you will feel like you could have gotten more out of reading the label on the vanilla ice cream container. The theme song by Paul McCartney did receive an Oscar nomination. 2.5 out of 5 stars."
"im_marc","Null","0","1","21 December 2003"," cruise:fear of commitment/guilt driven phantasy...maybe...
","FOR READERS WHO SAW THE MOVIE I just watched Vanilla Sky after i realised who the director was (i had very low motivation to see it 'cause on the surface it seemed to be just a love story between the two cruizes((who were dating at the time??)(O.K. i had no info whatsoever about it).And that title (from some cool song in the film I now know)seemed so flaky, I was sure the movie would be like Autumn in New York or some cr*p  Well, i really had a rough night, and had to find out more about the surrealistic twists and turns, so here is my take on the film (and i hope someone will comment cause i could be wrong). The whole thing CANNOT be considered some weird phantasmagoria!  Cruz was only a catalyst or agent for Cruise's pathology...Basically my impression is this: Cruise could not commit to the relationship with Diaz,whom he really did love.  He used his bestfriend's love interest at his birthday party(what better day to be selfish and egoistic) as a way to pull/distance himself from Diaz. O.K.? Now,Diaz dies. Cruise is disfigured. Best friend continues to date Cruz. After surviving the accident, the shock causes a psychosis wherein he creates a crime, a purgatory, and an imaginary dream world of a relationship with Cruz. guilt causes him to blame himself(If he had not been so cruel...)The mask is worn to hide his shame and the evidence/reminder of the traumatic event,only partially is he embarrassed about losing his perfect looks. Denial causes him to substitute the love he had for Diaz and transfer it onto Cruz. He is not willing to accept the truth and the loss of the woman he loved. In the nightclub he prefers to drink himself into oblivion with the bartender, and can only be cynical and cruel to Cruz.The love/pillow suffocation scene where he cannot accept the truth that is trying to break thru in his mind, to a point where he is willing to kill to escape. How can he (selfish and strong) love the stalker(selfish but weak)??  Did he die in the car crash?no Did he die of medication overdose?no Did he die from the skyscraper fall?no (No because of that sh*t about being frozen, and the final open eye). At the end I initially  thought he woke up in heaven or something (rejoining his true love...Diaz?). Of course, it could be that he was just a shallow playboy(with no feelings of love for anyone other than himself) who could not live with his crippled body and disfigurement, and was attached to Cruz because she was his last prospect before the accident...but why wouldn't he seek out past girlfriends instead?? I should say that i really like Cruz and her latin looks much more than the cute northern blonde Diaz, AND this helped me to accept Diaz as the unstable selfish stalker. AND, i really wanted the love at first sight birthday party encounter to stick and grow. But the tears flowed when i felt empathy for the love he lost with Diaz. What do you think...?"

","On my review about ""Abre Los Ojos"" (1997), I regarded ""Vanilla Sky"" as a poor and pointless remake. Well, I watched ""Vanilla Sky"" a few days ago and I wasn't wrong at all.<br/><br/>""Vanilla Sky is a remake that suffers of the comparison with the movie by Alejandro Amenabar. First of all, Cameron Crowe seems to like music very much (at a time, he used to be a journalist for ""Rolling Stone). But why did he overload his film with so much music? ""Vanilla Sky"" is a movie spoiled by an overwhelming music. Due to this, the movie looks like a huge clip. It's not that the music is bad but the chosen songs suit badly to a movie with a rather dramatic story. It also often plays a decorative role. It means that it appears in several sequences where it wasn't necessary at all. And the chosen songs are sometimes incompatible with the feeling of a few sequences. For example, when Tom Cruise is in the building of the ""Life Extension"" firm and he's yelling: ""I want to wake up!"", you hear in the background ""Good Vibrations"" by the Beach Boys. Is it really the song you can think about when you're in an anguished situation?<br/><br/>On another hand, ""Vanilla Sky"" is supposed to be a thriller and however, you don't feel that you deal with a thriller. Unlike Amenabar, Crowe doesn't manage in introducing a lasting suspense and anxiety feeling during the movie. Neither, does he succeed in increasing the spectator's curiosity. The omnipresence of the music has got something to do with it. Moreover, Tom Cruise's ""broken face"" after the car crash isn't as repulsive as Noriega's one in ""Abre Los Ojos"".<br/><br/>This is also a movie that seriously lacks of rhythm, especially near the end. Besides, the end of the movie turns out to be disappointing because the conclusion of the plot isn't clearly explained.<br/><br/>As it was supposed, there's a problem as far as the performance is concerned. ""Abre Los Ojos"" was a brilliant movie because Amenabar directed very well his actors and they weren't famous. So it made the story more credible. Here, Tom Cruise is too famous and you aren't used in seeing Cameron Diaz in a bad role. As for Kurt Russell, he's very colorless in the role of the analyst if you compare him to Pedro Miguela Martinez. It's the same thing for Noah Taylor who can't hold a candle to GÃ©rard Barray.<br/><br/>A flat remake. At a pinch, can you save beautiful pictures of ""a vanilla sky"" and if the movie disappointed you a lot, there's always the soundtrack."

","I haven't seen the original ""Abre Los Ojos"", so I approached ""Vanilla Sky"" with something of an open mind.

The quality I appreciate the most in these films is that they require you to think for yourself to work out a valid interpretation of the film (or at the very least piece everything together in the right order). The biggest flaw in ""VS"" is therefore the last half hour, where everything is laid out for you in excruciating detail.<br/><br/>As I said, I don't know if this is just a carbon copy of the original Spanish ending but either way I see it as an insult to the viewer. It's basically the director saying ""I'm sorry for having let you watch 2 hours of something that might seem confusing. Here - let me spell it out for you since you obviously didn't come to see a movie expecting to have to use your brain"".<br/><br/>""Vanilla Sky"" is not art but entertainment, and half-decent entertainment at that.

Besides beeing overlong and dull, Crowe effectively kills the potential tension by layering pop songs over virtually every scene. He should stay away from the thriller genre in the future, and continue with character-driven ensemble pieces. The DVD has a interesting ""behind the scenes""-look at the promo tour. Crowe meets Amenabar at a party in Spain, and I can sense what goes through Amenabars head.

Well, they should do the opponent way, just like I did and then they will feel the amusing elements.  <br/><br/>I like the way the movie entertains me. Somewhat, similar to what `The Truman Show' did. Watch it with heart and passion and in the end, your expectation is achieved. One thing bother me is the lack of the chemistry between Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz. I don't know with Penelope, maybe she should just stand for those Spanish language movies instead.  I worship Cameron Diaz though, because she looks so stunning and got such a fabulous acts. She definitely one of my acting divas. <br/><br/>In general, avoid `Vanilla Sky' if you want to watch a light movie (as a regular movie consumer), but a-must-see if you a truly moviegoers.<br/><br/>

","SPOILERS THROUGHOUT!!<br/><br/>OK-I was really looking forward to Vanilla Sky. It looked interesting in the previews though I went expecting more of a ""final analysis"" type of thing. What I got was something else altogether.<br/><br/>This maybe the only movie that I walked out of as confused as when I walked in. The movie made absolutely no sense from start to finish. Yeah, I grasp the general concept but..I've always said there's unrealistic and then there's over the top. (Then there's another category all together-over the top multiplied by six. I think that's where Vanilla Sky is.)Anyway-the final plot was so unrealistic in certain areas and left so many questions unanswered it was almost embarrassing, not to mention unbelievable.<br/><br/>This movie really plays games with your head. Just when you think you've got it figured out(the plot, not which girl Tom Cruise is making love to)it morphs into something else entirely. I understand plot twists, I favor movies with plot twists. But vanilla sky is more then a movie with plot twists, it's one long twister.There are so MANY plot twists you can't relax enough to figure out what's going on minute to minute and enjoy the movie. That takes away a lot of the movie's overall power.<br/><br/>I think this movie could have been really terrible had it not been for the incredible cast who for some reason decided to do this(sc-fi, for lack of a better term.) Had the movie not been done with skilled actors/actresses like Cruz, Cruise and Diez this could have been not just bad but a joke. In reality though these performers are so incredibly talented they keep you glued to the screen in spite of all the movie's obvious flaws. I think that says a lot more about their acting ability then the quality of the movie.<br/><br/>I hate when I see a movie that seems like it could have been done so much better. The question I have is why were so many questions unanswered in this movie? I'd like to know because despite everything I (somewhat) enjoyed this movie."

","Director Cameron Crowe reunites with mega-star Tom Cruise from their 1996 collaboration of the romantic-comedy ""Jerry Maguire"" to give you 2001's most erotic, complex, and thrilling film that is surely one of the best films of the year.  This film is titled ""Vanilla Sky.""  Though difficult it is to know everything about the movie, it runs in the line of ""Memento"" and ""Mulholland Drive,"" the main questions it poses are these: How do we distinquish the difference between reality and dreams, what happens when they start colliding, do we hit the Vanilla Sky or go falling flat to the ground? The answers are harder to find than it might seem.  I have watched this film many times, and for starters, what you might want to do is run a list of every scene and then but a check if it is real of an x if it is a dream. But first let me back and inform those about the plot. David Amies (Mr. Cruise) is a wealthy tycoon living the American Dream he inherited from his father and having the perfect f*ck buddy in Julie Gianni, played by a ravishing Cameron Diaz in too-few of scenes.  At his thirty-third birthday party he falls in love, for what might be the first time, with Sophia, played by real-life sweetheart Penelope Cruz, who also turns in a sterling performance but was overrated by the critics, which gave less attention to the better of the two actresses. ""The saddest person to ever hold a martini,"" is how Sophia beautifully describes Julie.  David seems to agree when Sophia makes this comment, though you can see he is taken back.  It is not until the next day that he fully knows just how sad his f*ck buddy is, and obsessed too.  Julie stalkes David at the party, and apparently that night which he spends at Sophia's, because the next morning she pulls up in her teary blue-eyed car and takes him for a ride in which she confesses her true emotions for David, how she does not like to be known as his f*ck buddy, and then drives over a bridge, which apparently kills her and disfigures him.  <br/><br/>Here the questions start beginning.  Was the car ride just a dream?  Is the beautiful, saint-like Sophia just a figment of David's imagination?  Though I did say earlier that Ms. Diaz was in too-few of scenes, Miss Giani does pop up again, in the most expected time and place, when David is either alone in his bed or sleeping with Sophia.  So are Sophia and Julie the same person, a symbol of David's misuse of women and his rambuscious tendancies? The questions I have just mentioned and a thousand more will pop up in your mind when watching this fascinating movie.  I could not take my eyes off it. I didn't close them once.  <br/><br/>Rated: R for sexuality and strong language.<br/><br/>Appropriate Ages: 15 and up.<br/><br/>GRADE: A+"

","""Open your eyes"" is a good no it's a great opening line for all the people bashing this film.Cameron Crowe even gives you a hint in the opening line that this isn't going to be your average popcorn film but a film you are going to have to open your eyes a little wider (hmm makes me think of another film  that went under the radar and was bashed ""Eyes Wide shut"" Kubrick is the man by the way)The premise is their for you people,next time a film opens up with a line having to do with opening your eyes wider or looking closer , if you are not open minded just don't view the film , simple as that.<br/><br/>Anyway I viewed this movie when it first came out and was blown away, touches on so many feelings and emotions a summary from me will not do the movie justice.You will just have to view this film on your own and decide what you think of it.

","I don't know what movie the person above watched, because the ""Vanilla Sky"" that I saw is fantastic!  Cameron Crowe did an excellent job writing this piece, and the soundtrack was also excellent.  Nancy Wilson is still brilliant on the guitar, and other songs by the likes of Peter Gabriel, Bob Dylan, Paul McCartney and Michael Stipe created a very relaxing and dreamlike atmosphere for this movie, which is very appropriate for reasons I will not get into for fear of ruining anything.<br/><br/>I personally thought the ending was quite the mind-bender!  It was not quite Hitchcock, but close, and I personally left the movie in awe.  Again, without ruining anything, I will say that once the audience realizes what is going on, this movie opens up a very intriguing philosophical discussion about life and death.<br/><br/>However, I must agree on one thing, and that is that Jason Lee did a great job in this movie.  I have long been a fan of Lee, particularly in the Kevin Smith movies and another Cameron Crowe masterpiece, ""Almost Famous"".  It is nice to see him play a more serious role than Brodie and Bankie (see ""Mallrats"", ""Chasing Amy"" and ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"").  His character is a great friend to Tom Cruise's character, and Lee did a great job of making this character believable and likeable.<br/><br/>Perhaps this review isn't too helpful, but I don't want to give away too much, and I don't know how to describe the true genius of this movie without giving away important plot points.  All I can say is give it a chance, and I don't think you will be disappointed."
"forecastmazy","10","0","1","11 June 2003"," Another AMAZING Cameron Crowe Film
","Cameron Crowe does it again in this amazing film. Vanilla Sky is what made Tom Cruise worthy of my respect. I mean being in a Cameron Crowe film is like being in a piece of rock history. The references of course to Radiohead and other amazing bands and the comparison to citizen Kane in a modern way could only be done in such a fashionable and interesting way by Cameron Crowe. <br/><br/>I can't think of anything I would dislike about this movie. It confuses the slowest of people; If you wanted Top Gun you shouldn't see this movie. Tom Cruise is an amazing actor and the days of Top Gun 80s flicks are over. Tom Cruise gains the respect of the art community with this film.<br/><br/>
Tom Cruise in this film plays a man who has everything. The man ultimately finds himself in some sort of conspiracy but his world is twisted and twilight zone like. When hes unable to trust even his own memory he questions his own reality...and the story just goes down the rabbit hole. It's hard not to like this movie unless your the type who likes to watch a film once and forget about it. You can't watch this movie and not think about it. The film has an ability to twist you and amaze you.<br/><br/>
You could get lost and confused, I know alot of people did, but this movie is one you'll definitely want to own. Unless you like to watch American movies that just pet you on the head and star Martin Lawerence. This isn't an action movie, its a mainstream art movie. Unfortunately when you go to the mainstream with cinema-art you confuse half the dumb-witted who just DONT WANT THEIR LEVEL OF QUESTIONING raised. <br/><br/>Jason Lee has an amazing performance in it, every character plays a key role and just leaves themselves in your psyche. Vanilla Sky is not a movie you can explain, you must experience it. I saw it once and watched it immediately again. And then the next day. Probably seven or eight times in the first week. It amazed me, it inspired me. Cameron Crowe, you truly are my hero. Everyone should watch this movie, even if you know you won't get it."

Does the music match the scenes? Well to some no, but again, there is a beauty to the contrast and each song was put there for a purpose, if you take the time to notice.<br/><br/>Vanilla Sky is a movie that brings out emotions of sadness, fear, romance, happiness, suspense, anger and confusion and I was completely surprised 2 years later when I decided to go ahead and watch it regardless of all the good and bad things people had to say about it.<br/><br/>Take a chance and be rewarded.<br/><br/>This is truly a brilliant movie and it definitely will be added to my DVD cellar and remember, the sweet is never as sweet without the sour!"
"nitesite","6","0","1","1 June 2003"," not nearly as good as the original, but a good try
","Slight spoilers may be in this... but if you don't know by now...<br/><br/>Background before I go any further: I'm a big C. Crowe fan - but he needs to stick to originals. I saw Abre Los Ojos first, though it's been almost a year since I saw it. I'd been avoiding Vanilla Sky because I'd heard awful things about it. I just caught it on cable.<br/><br/>Overall, not *that* bad. I thought Jason Lee was great, Cameron Diaz once again plays the psycho well (Very Bad Things was a very bad movie, ha ha, but she shone in it as a psycho as well.) Tom Cruise was Tom Cruise (eh), and Penelope Cruz is so much better in Spanish films, but I could deal with her here much better than in Blow. I still like the story - if you have a problem with suspension of disbelief, avoid this as well as the original. It was true to the original at least in that much.<br/><br/>The bad parts: A little too long, a little slow, and some rather bad choices in musical moments. (I like most of the music chosen, but they didn't always fit well into the scenes. It was almost as if someone was just trying to point out how much they knew about music...) The biggest problem I have with it though is only in comparison to the original. Crowe over-explains the whole thing. I don't remember there being that long of an ending in the original - there was explanation, but it didn't take as long to explain somehow... I think it was dumbed down a bit, maybe as a reaction to what the American audiences tend to want. It was almost insulting - you could figure out what the next sentence was going to be, what the explanation for each element was (trying really hard to avoid spoilers here) before they actually got to it. After they explain the splice - there's really not much more that you have to have spelled out. Though maybe with having seen the original, that's just how it feels...<br/><br/>Anyway - 6 out of 10. Not great, but not awful either. Better watched on a lazy Sunday evening on cable than having paid for any of it... :)"

"DeeNine-2","9","0","1","4 March 2003"," Transcends the original
","Here in Vanilla Sky, a thoughtful reprise of the Spanish film Open Your Eyes (1997), directed by Alejandro Amenabar, we have Tom Cruise, American heart throb and box office buffo paired with his current true love, the amazingly beautiful and very talented Penelope Cruz.<br/><br/>Guess what happens. The public doesn't like him. Even though this is a more finely structured and comprehensible film than Open Your Eyes (we'll get to that in moment), Tom Cruise is NOT sympathetic, or at least it takes us until near the end of the film to feel any sympathy for him, and then perhaps what we feel most sympathetic for is the mask that is Tom Cruise in most of the later reels.<br/><br/>I think the problem is that Cruise is miscast. Unlike Eduardo Noriega, who played the same part in the film directed by Alejandro Amenabar, Cruise is too cute and too privileged to elicit our sympathy. We almost feel his character has it coming. After all, he willingly got into the car with his ""stalker"" (Cameron Diaz) presumably to have a little sexual fun. And this just after spending a Platonic night with Sofia (Penelope Cruz), whom he is now supposed to be in love with. Furthermore--and this may be just a minor point, but a telling one--Cruise's disfigurement was not as gross as was Noriega's. One gets the sense that perhaps Cruise insisted on it being that way.<br/><br/>From another angle, one might ask, is this deja vu all over again? Recall that Cruise was married to Nichole Kidman when he played opposite her in Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut. Guess what happened. The public didn't like it. Aside from the fact that they didn't understand it, what they didn't like was Tom Cruise. He was NOT sympathetic. One could not identify with his cruising various kinky sexual opportunities as a privileged married doctor.<br/><br/>Having said all that, I still think that this film, directed by the very talented Cameron Crowe, who wrote Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982) and wrote and directed Almost Famous (2000), is the better film. Why? Mainly because Crowe demonstrates a better understanding of the underlining theme of the film than did Amenabar. (Of course he had the benefit of Amenabar's film to improve upon.)<br/><br/>What I am getting at is the precarious nature of our brain's experience of reality. On one level, I think that is what the film is really all about. (On another level of course there is a love triangle.) Throw the cryonics mumble jumble out the window and consider that we might, as some people believe, become software. As partial products of our own culture we will (at least in the beginning) experience glitches that will destroy our dreams, just as David Aames's guilty conscience destroyed his lucid dream and made him see a projection of his fear and his guilt instead of seeing his beloved Sofia.<br/><br/>If we do become software, there will be imperfect matches between our biological nature and the artificial neural nets we will fuse with. We will not be freezing ourselves in the future. Instead we will merge with our machines as we live and become part human and part artificial intelligence--something beyond human. This is the glimpse of the future that Cameron Crowe extends to us, a possibility that he saw in the Spanish language film not fully worked out by Amenabar.<br/><br/>Despite his miscasting, I think Tom Cruise gave a spirited performance, and I think only his celebrity and the compromised personality of the character he plays kept some movie goers from fully appreciating his work.<br/><br/>Penelope Cruz is more playful here than she was in Open Your Eyes and her role here is somewhat larger. Crowe makes sure she has ample time in front of the camera to mesmerize us, and she does. At some point I realized that she reminded me a little of Audrey Hepburn. Perhaps she has been watching some of Miss Hepburn's films. (I would bet on it.) Regardless, she, whom I first saw in Belle Epoque (1992) when she was eighteen, is utterly bewitching.<br/><br/>Also giving an excellent performance is Cameron Diaz as the fatally scorned other woman. She brings a sexy, haunting quality to the part that works well with Cruise's software ""experiences."" She is not quite as convincing a stalker as was Najwa Nimri in the original, however, and this may be another reason that this film only gets 7.0 out of 10 stars from the voters at IMDb while Open Your Eyes gets 7.8.<br/><br/>Usually I prefer the original to the remake, the European film to the Hollywood production, but in this case I think it is Vanilla Sky that will be remembered. At any rate, look past Tom Cruise's celebrity and see this for Cameron Crowe whose vision of a virtually real future is intriguing and reveals that he did his homework.<br/><br/>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

","SPOILERS.<br/><br/>All of the movie is, like Gaul, divided into three parts.  (1) Handsome, young, wealthy, powerful Tom Cruise crosses his blonde temporary squeeze and takes up with a darker more viable squeeze.  In doing so he betrays his friend.  He's also involved in a tug of war with the board of directors for control of his company.  A love story.  (2)  Handsome etc. Cruise is involved in an accident in which his face is disfigured and he degrades himself by being drunk and hiding from the world and engaging in first-degree self pity.  Strange things begin happening to him because of the various metal items in his partially reconstructed face.  (3)  There follows the unraveling of a mystery in a sci fi setting, rather like ""Total Recall.""<br/><br/>You have to feel sorry for the hero.  I mean here he is, in all his Tom Cruiseness, stalked by a blonde (with whom he can make love four times in one night yet).  It doesn't help that the rejected stalker is played by the stultifyingly charming and beautiful Cameron Diaz.  You can tell this is a guy who's used to getting what he wants -- and exactly what he wants. The other babe is no slouch either.  It's Penelope Cruz in long, silky black hair, with an enchanting mole on her sternum, a voice like a non-smoking Victoria Golena, and a striking elfin presence, along the lines of Maria Bartiromo.  He deserves to get his face smashed, just for having it so good!<br/><br/>He's kind of his usual cocky self at the beginning, and why shouldn't he be cocky?  He can not only pick between blonde and brunette but he can hump his best friend and not feel guilty too.  But then things begin to get a little twisted.  His face is so banged up that his appeal is called into question. We begin to wonder if this is going to turn into another one of those movies in which a disabled person has to learn to overcome his disability or at least his feelings of self disgust.  Then things get even more twisted. He's goes to bed with Penelope and wakes up to find Cameron next to him. (Either way would be okay for most of us.  Both of them together and all men could make love four times a night, or even five or ten.)  He's cured of that disfigured visage.  But then he looks in a mirror and it's back! When he's in a bar with his best friend and the guy jokes that his newly renewed face is splitting a seam, we're as scared as Cruise.  There's another scene in a bar later in which some guy with a Brit accent informs Cruise that everything happening to him is his own invention, that he can make anyone do whatever he wants.  Cruise shouts that all he wants right now is for everyone to shut up.  They obligingly do so.  Is he on acid?  Is he nuts. Is he going through something like the guy who was hanged at Owl Creek Bridge?  What's up?  There has so far been a kind of framing story in which Cruise, wearing a regnerative prosthetic mask, is trying to figure this all out with a psychologist in prison.  It seems he, Cruise, has murdered someone.  Fragments of the act return.  Yes, he murders Cameron, but no, it's Penelope, as we can tell from that succulent nevis on her chest.<br/><br/>Well, folks, the ending will clear things up for you.  But, I must say, the resolution sits kind of uncomfortably on top of what's gone on before, incongruously, like a fool's cap on a seal's head.  It's pretty much out of the Twilight Zone.  By this time the viewer is as delirious as the hero. But that's not quite the right word.  Delirious is from de liro -- ""I rave"" -- but what we have here is dreaming, not raving, even though the dream is supposed to be pleasant instead of warped into a nightmare by the guilt Cruise carries around in his subconscious.<br/><br/>It's an interesting movie if you can accept the disjointed plot and get past those somewhat grinding shifts of gear.  The acting could hardly be improved on.  Cameron Diaz has the face, and the ability, to switch from helpless devotion to something more sinister.  I've only seen one other film with Penelope Cruz, a quite different part, but she is immensely appealing here, always cheerfully in control of what's going on around her, knowledgeable beyond any expectable point about herself and the people around her. She's fine.  And Tom Cruise has never given a better performance.  As an actor maybe he has a tendency to smile and laugh too much.  In this case, his smiles and laughter assume heavily ironic tones.  There is a scene in which Diaz tries to talk him into taking a ride with her, just after he's left Cruz's apartment.  It gives him a chance to display his range as a performer and he handles it very well.  When Diaz first calls to him that smirky grin appears and he says, ""You're following me.""  Her entreaties become more serious and personal, and watch his expression and hear his voice change to one that suggests -- not exactly personal injury -- but the closing of a door.<br/><br/>The direction is well done too, considering the challenges that needed to be met to put such a story line across.  And the photography is outstanding. Vanilla skies indeed.<br/><br/>I recommend seeing this, but fasten your seatbelts.  It's not a conventional love story, a conventional self-discovery movie, a conventional mystery, or a conventional science fiction story, although it's a little of all of these."

In the original, Penny was a penniless student (pardon the pun!), but you feel for her, but not as a Dancer in this movie, because Dancers can easily become strippers making a grand a week!-No sympathy vote here. What is worse is that Tom and Penny's love-making scenes are like accidentally walking into you parents- So Cheesy! playing with a mole on her chest???? EVEN THE CAMERA LOOKS AWAY TO THE BED BOARD TO PASS THE TIME! The Movie critics across the Atlantic commented on Tom and Penny's disability to set the scene on fire, like Penny was with the original star, Edwardo Noreiga, as the good-looking playboy - at least they made you feel lonesome.<br/><br/>Kurt Russell was a waste of talent.<br/><br/>Diaz lacks sympathy as a Psycho b**** from hell, who still confuses herself as a Charlie's angel kicking Tom's butt "" oh! Sorry I thought you were a vandal?"" Why Hollywood must portray people as either the innocent goodies or the neurotic baddies in the plot, or having a moral center?? In Abre los Ojos, Nawja Nimri as Nuria was jilted, and felt used and enraged - so you feel sorry for her! and I cared about all the others in Abre los ojos- it is more Sinister, Violent, intelligent, psychological, and Sexy, even the music is brilliant and I felt like watching it again, so I recommend the SUPERIOR Spanish Original. However Vanilla Sky is a flop, watching it was like torture DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME."

","After reading multiple comments about how rotten Vanilla Sky was, I felt like I had to offer an alternative opinion to the list. I couldn't help but enjoy this film for its visual style as well as its abnormal storyline taken from ""Open Your Eyes."" I agree with many that Cameron Diaz gave a fantastic performance.. and I have yet to see Jason Lee in a role that he did not steal the show with, however, I have to go out on a limb and say that Tom Cruise, also, excelled in Vanilla Sky. In fact, I find that Tom Cruise generally give good performances, but his ""pretty boy"" image makes certain that he is never taken seriously. I'm not saying he is any Brando or Oliver, but I think that his talents would be taken more seriously if he was of average or less average looks. What I love most about Vanilla Sky is that I can watch it time and time again, and catch a new element of the story every time. If you haven't seen it, try it. And if you have already seen it, try it again."
"jascry","1","0","2","1 January 2003"," Abomination
","I've seen, and love, the original film Abre los Ojos by Alejandro Amenabar. Having seen it several times, and as an actor, I can comment on how well constructed every moment of the film is.  The story is constructed to keep you constantly wondering what exactly is going on from beginning to end and the acting is so perfect that the performances mimic real life. Unfortunately Vanilla Sky is but a pale reflection of the film it so shamelessly attempts to copy.<br/><br/>By taking what is meant to be a convoluted story and overexplaining it, Cameron Crowe dulls the impact significantly and turns it into an almost unintentional comedy.  The concept is far fetched and Amenabar was well aware of that when he wrote Abre los Ojos.  Apparently Crowe felt that the only way to keep an audience interested is by attempting to tie up every loose end to the point where it becomes redundant and completely uninteresting.  We understand what is happening almost an hour before it ends so why must it be consistenly drilled home?<br/><br/>Unfortunately the real disappointment is in the performances.  Tom Cruise is no better than a dime store version of the original's Eduardo Noriega and Penelope Cruz lacks any of the charisma she had in the original.  Also, the intentions of all of the actors are so far from how the story is designed that it ruins any impact the film could have had.  The usually excellent Jason Lee was obviously given no direction and flounders aimlessly in his character.  Cameron Diaz is so abominable that she can't, even for a moment, convince me that she is even attempting to stay in character.  Of course the fact that Crowe wrote the characters so lifelessly that they would not have been convincing regardless of who the actors were.<br/><br/>In the end I'd highly recommend staying as far from this abomination as possible and watching the far superior Abre los Ojos.  I know this is 2 hours of my life I'll never get back so hopefully you won't have to suffer the same fate."

","Vanilla Sky is a mess. It's hard to believe a studio would actually let a film like this be made. Not because of how bad it is (bad movies are made all the time) but of how bizzare it is. I watched this film expecting a clever, suspenseful thriller. Was I ever wrong, Vanilla Sky is the bastard offspring of Sci-Fi, Romance, Drama and Arthouse, and instead of revealing bit by bit of the plot, leaving you on the edge of your chair in suspense until the end of the film, it is contrived and ridiculous. Sadly it seems some mistake inane and ridiculous for clever and creative, considering it's 7.0 Imdb rating and $100M box office take. To those, a little advice: Open Your Eyes."

"llihilloh","1","0","2","30 November 2002"," This is the second worst film I have ever seen.
","'Vanilla Sky' is awful.  It is the second worst film that I have ever had the misfortune of viewing.  'Mulholland Dr.' is the absolute worst, but I don't know, it comes pretty close.<br/><br/>It is so weird how I dislike this film, yet I love Cameron Crowe's previous film, 'Almost Famous' so much.  'Almost Famous' is one of my favorite films of all time.  So, what was Crowe's problem here?  I have no idea, but his direction of this project is so bad that it's a wonder if he finds work after this.  <br/><br/>Tom Cruise, what were you thinking?  Oh, I just adore Cruise, but it really hurts that he would go out and pick this dud when he could have had the pick of ANY film in the world.  I think that he is a terrific actor, and his looks don't hurt, of course, but his acting was so....dull in 'Vanilla Sky.' For some unknown reason, he managed to get well over $20 million here, but for what exactly?  Cameron Diaz was just okay.  I don't understand how she got the kind of (rave) reviews she got.  How did she get a Golden Globe nomination?  Everyone acts as if she was the main character in this film, when really she didn't even have that big of a part.  Seriously, her performance was overrated, overrated, overrated!  Penélope Cruz.  What can I say except that she is the worst actress ever.  Well, I suppose if you're out to capture a terrible movie, you better go out and hire the worst actress in the industry.  Not only is she hard to understand her with the darn accent and all, but....she can't act!  It's as plain and simple as that.  She acts as if she's the best thing in the picture.  I hate to use this saying because even I hate it, but she couldn't act her way out of a paper bag.  Oh, I like Jason Lee.  It's a shame that he had such a small part.  Kurt Russell must have been in dire need of work when he signed on to do this film.  This cast is one of the most terrible ones that I have ever seen.  Again, why'd you do it Tom!?<br/><br/>This plot is so out there.  It is way too out there.  The film was all fine and everything up until the car accident.  After that, it was complete chaos and confusion.  'Vanilla Sky' continued on and it seemed okay, I suppose, but then when the whole thing is explained and 'cleared up', it just gets messed up again (if that makes any sense).  <br/><br/>The writing was BORING!  I couldn't even follow half of the script mainly because I didn't want to.  The whole film just seemed so pointless. <br/><br/>
There were two things in this film that I actually did like.  One, Jason Lee manages to show up.  I loved him in 'Almost Famous' and it was a pleasure to see him again, no matter how minor his role was.  Two, I really liked the famous Times Square scene.  It was different and very cool.  Come on, what other film could have pulled that stunt off?<br/><br/>There's nothing worse than a movie that ends too quickly, leaving a lot to the imagination.  And that's exactly what 'Vanilla Sky' did.  It ended at the drop of a hat and I was actually left staring at the TV screen wondering if something else would pop back up.  You know, to clarify some things. Yeah, it didn't.<br/><br/>So, the script was meant to...well, I don't really know what it was meant to do.  Maybe its goal was to help people get a good night's rest.  I don't know!  Tom Cruise is a good actor but fails to deliver an even half decent performance.  Two other good things slip onto the screen, but Penélope Cruz and that retarded mask that Cruise wears for most of the film, manage to completely ruin the film all together.  'Vanilla Sky' gets a big old '1' out of me.  I wouldn't recommend this one to anyone."

","There is no way of summarising this film. But to be very brief, Vanilla Sky is filmmaking at its very best. Here is my overall statement in regards to it; I truly loved this film. Vanilla Sky really got 2002 off to a great start. Lets start with the acting.<br/><br/>Asides for Oceans Eleven, (another great movie), Vanilla Sky has the best ensemble cast so far this year. First of all, Tom Cruise is the film's shining light. He plays the `Citizen Dildo', rich playboy part and the Elephant Man part supremely. And deserves an Oscar nomination, at least. Penelope Cruz gives a very credible performance and her relationship with Cruise off-screen was a further benefit towards the film. Cameron Diaz is only in the first 40 minutes of the film and any other time she appears in the film, there's something strange going on. Otherwise she's fairly good. Jason Lee, though initially unkempt, is perfect with his `2nd best' character. Kurt Russell gives another top-notch performance, this time as a sympathetic psychiatrist. There are other parts in the film varying from cameos to big rolls. Among these are Noah Taylor, Timothy Spall, Tilda Swilton, Alicia Witt and Steven Spielberg. So, the film has a strong cast and some excellent performances.<br/><br/>Followed up by this is some impeccable directing. Cameron Crowe does an excellent job and creates a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Vanilla Sky is divided up into 3 parts. For the first 40 minutes it's a witty, romantic slice of life with a thrilling finish. For the next 45 minutes it's a gloomy, dramatic, psychological thriller. The least of the 3 parts. And, the 3rd part. For the final 45 minutes, Vanilla Sky is a mystery thriller cum sci-fi drama.<br/><br/>PLOT SPOILERS I liked the twist in the end. I'm well aware that its caused controversy, but I think that a sci-fi twist was the way to go. Without the cryogenation-half-way-through-the-movie, the film would not have worked. It explains everything, so that there's no questions asked. It also leaves you asking questions about philosophy and reality, afterwards. SPOILERS END<br/><br/>It covers SO many genres. It's a drama, thriller, romance, mystery, noir, comedy and a sci-fi. In conclusion, if you have a short attention span and/or are a sarcastic, moronic cynic, then don't watch Vanilla Sky. Otherwise, rent it NOW. 10/10."

","Without a shadow of a doubt Vanilla Sky is the greatest piece of cinema to come out of Hollywood in years.I don't consider this I remake more of a reimagining of its predecessor ABRE LOS OJOS (Open your eyes).It takes the original idea and expands up on it a little bit. Fleshing out some characters and backstory.Cameron Diaz plays her part very well as a stalker. Penelope Cruz the link between both films walks through her role with ease. Although im not a big Tom Cruise fan, this film alone opened up a new door of respect to his acting talents and proving he is just not a smile upon the camera. If you have ever been in love with a person that somehow vanished from your life this film will be a real treat for you.So open your eyes and watch this movie. You will not regret it."

","I'm not sure why it took me so long to get around to seeing this film, because I did enjoy Cameron Crowe's previous films, especially Almost Famous, a film that was created back to back with this one.<br/><br/>
I expected that this would be a great film, because Cameron has a great sense of beauty in his portrayal of human emotions, but i had no idea of the depth of his ideals of love, emotion, consiquence, etc.<br/><br/>This film works on so many levels.  It is a psychological thriller, science fiction, drama, etc.  Every moment you think you have figured it out, it's compleatly different than what you expected.  Plus, this is another film where cameron's uncanny ability to convey an emotion shines through, with the help of some great acting.<br/><br/>Beyond its content depth, it has spectacular visuals.  The whole film has a David Lynch-like dream quality to it.  His immense love of music also shows.  His blending of Nancy Wilson's (his wife/ ex heart guitarist) compositions and the intense visuals flow together beautifully.<br/><br/>For me, the best thing about the movie is how it draws you in.  You compleatly forget about your own life because you are so overwhelmed with his.  When it ended, i was amazed at the fact that i was still sitting in my apartment.  Anyway.....wether or not you agree with Cameron's views on life, love, etc is beside the point.  I think it is a man trying to share his views and ideals, and leave them for you to think about, he's not trying to push anything on you, and i think the film is worth seeing for all these reasons."

I was lost for a good part of the film and only the beauty of Cameron Diaz and Penelope Cruz kept me interested. I wasn't terribly impressed with Tom Cruise in this one and he's usually very good. Kurt Russell did the best acting job in the film as the psychologist. Maybe I'm just getting dumb in my old age, but this one just didn't do it for me."

","I went to see this movie in the theaters expecting a watered down version of Abre los Ojos, little did I know that Cameron Crowe was going to take his version, and inject so much life and humanity into it! To say I was pleasantly surprised is the understatement of the year! I plainly fell in LOVE with this movie, even more when it was finally released on DVD, and I got to see Crowe's commentary and just hear him express all the things unsaid in the actual feature.<br/><br/>I am a big fan of audio commentaries, specially by directors who LOVE their craft. Cameron Crowe is one of those directors. The audio commentaries for Almost Famous and Vanilla Sky are amongst the best ive ever had the pleasure of listening in to.<br/><br/>Cameron Crowe has said in interviews that Alejandro's take on both movies was this :  He thought the movie was like two brothers: one that was into opera and one that was into rock n roll. That was my dream that you could watch both movies and see some similarities and see that we took some different paths too.<br/><br/>People tend to get mad because the movie gives away the whole plot device in the end, but those who do, arent really ""getting"" what the movie is *really* about. The Sci-fi plot devices in the movie are really just a means to an end, the *real* meat and potatos of the movie's message is within the relationship of David and Sofia, and in my opinion, this was much better developed (as were most of the characters) in Vanilla Sky than in Abre..., where the characters felt a bit one dimensioned, at least compared to their counterparts in Vanilla Sky. (specially the best friend character, which Jason Lee played to perfection, that character was pretty much one dimensional in Abre...)<br/><br/>

","It's nice to see Tom Cruise taking some risks lately, doing arty stuff like this movie and Eyes Wide Shut, and playing a drug addict in Minority Report.<br/><br/>But risks don't always pay off.<br/><br/>Vanilla Sky is a remake of the Spanish film Open Your Eyes, which I haven't seen. This is one of those movies where you're not sure if what's happening is real. I usually love this kind of movie (Jacob's Ladder is a good example of the genre), but Cameron Crowe messed this one up. It's hard to be affected (shocked, moved) by a movie that never goes beneath the surface of things. The characters aren't fleshed out, the relationships are never made believable, and the surprise ending has no weight - it may indeed be unexpected, but it is also rather uninteresting. The same concept was handled in a much less heavy-handed (and more entertaining and effective) way in Total Recall. I think the key problem is that this is a remake; I think Crowe could have done a great job if he had written his own original script. There are a few nicely surreal moments (such as the much-discussed Times Square sequence), but they are stranded in the middle of a failed experiment.<br/><br/>The best thing about this movie is the director's great taste in music - the soundtrack features excellent, well-chosen tracks by Radiohead, R.E.M., Sinead O'Connor, and The Chemical Brothers, among others."

","A highly enjoyable ""drama"" that really is something else in disguise. It has an absolutely fascinating story that, for once in a long time, left me wondering what was going to happen next. I never knew what was happening, or what was going to occur next. It's a mysterious, fun, surreal, mystifying, and highly enjoyable movie. It's definitely not an action movie. Highly celebral. I most recommend it with a 10 rating! Fantastic acting and directing. Cameron Crowe made the movie light and comical, and then he would twist it around and make it dark and surreal.

"vanillafan","10","0","1","29 July 2002"," A beautiful, soulful, thoughtful labour of love from Crowe and Cruise
","I decided to review this movie here on IMDB only after having read tons of other user comments, which are notoriously split (just like the ""official"" critics' are) on a fifty-fifty ratio: ""This movie is awesome!!"" ... ""No, this movie is awful!!"", and so on.<br/><br/>It surely is a love-it-or-hate-it picture, and the film-makers, best buddies Cameron Crowe and Tom Cruise, have obviously always been fully aware of that.<br/><br/>I consider myself very much among those who love it.<br/><br/>I'm Italian, so I saw Abre Los Ojos (which was co-produced with Italian mini-major Lucky Red) long before I saw Vanilla Sky. I love Abre Los Ojos as well, but I enjoyed Vanilla Sky - lack of plot originality aside, natch - much more.<br/><br/>Vanilla Sky, being a Cameron Crowe movie, has all the deeply felt research of the lead character's soul that Abre Los Ojos - which is gripping and genial but rather cold - doesn't have.<br/><br/>I ached all the time for David (he's kind of a spoiled jerk, sure, but in his soul and mind are stirring, even before the accident, a thousand diverse feelings, and a refreshing confusion takes hold of him when he's in Sofia's apartment on that first - and last, actually - night they spent together).<br/><br/>On the contrary, I can't say I felt the same pain for César, who is an arrogant brat before, during and after the accident (perhaps it has to do with the fact that the Spanish lead character César is a 25-year-old, as was star Eduardo Noriega at the time, and therefore is much younger than 33-year-old David Aames, and even more so than star Tom Cruise, who was a 38-year-old when he shot Vanilla Sky).<br/><br/>That said, I saw Vanilla Sky more than once in the theater (bringing with me, each time, some very carefully selected, open-minded friend: they all loved it). Now I have seen it again on DVD.<br/><br/>Well, each and every time I found myself glued to my seat, even though I knew the story from the very beginning. I was simply mesmerized: this movie is so dense and thoughtful; I will never grew tired of it!<br/><br/>The credit here goes, in my opinion, mainly to the Herculean efforts of Tom Cruise, who has been my favorite actor since his wonderful turn in Born On The Fourth Of July, and as a matter of fact I think that David Aames shares more than a bit of rage, pain, desperation and bewilderment with Cruise's memorable Ron Kovic character, and even with his equally memorable Frank T.J. Mackey character from Magnolia.<br/><br/>Those, for me, are the ideal roles where Cruise can totally express his dashing persona and his powerful on-screen generosity (so I'm patiently waiting for September 27, when Minority Report and his John Anderton will finally grace the Italian theaters), far better than playing the sleepwalking, muzzled Bill Harford he had to play (forcing himself, in his own words) while enduring the slow agony of Eyes Wide Shut.<br/><br/>
I can't help to admire how much he's grown (as an extremely accomplished, skilled and soulful thespian) since his beefcake teenage idol days.<br/><br/>
I surely disagree with those who say he's overacted and/or has merely played himself here, cockiness and mugging included. Are you kidding? The first third of the movie HAD to show the very shallowness of David Aames: the cockiness and the mugging  were vital for the entire following story development!<br/><br/>As for the ""Tom Cruise merely plays himself"" issue, I'd like to end this review with a quote from the great, late director Billy Wilder (it's taken from ""Conversations with Wilder"", the acclaimed 2000 book by Cameron Crowe): ""He [Tom Cruise] is a thinking actor. He makes it look effortless. For example, Rain Man. It took several years for everyone to realize that the roles coul have been switched. That is a movie I would have liked to have seen - the crazy guy is the good-looking one. The ease in which he handles the hardest roles ... Tom Cruise, he's like Cary Grant. He makes the hard things look simple. On film, Cary Grant could walk into the room and say ""Tennis anyone?"" like no one else. You don't value the skill until you see a less skilled actor try the same thing. It's pure gold"".<br/><br/>What can I add? It says everything. Those audiences who disliked Vanilla Sky might try again: it'll probably surprise them. It doesn't end to surprise me, either."

"dee.reid","10","0","1","24 June 2002"," Understand a few things ***SPOILERS HERE IN***
","Cameron Crowe's ""Vanilla Sky"" may not be the total mind bending ""alternative piece of film"" that we may have wanted it to be, but it sure is something to behold. I understand that this film has received quite a number of bashings (not like ""Pearl Harbor"", but even those criticisms weren't that necessary) and an equal amount of praise as well. This is definitely a thinking persons kind of film, though not on the level of something say ""The Usual Suspects"" but is close to being there with an ending where all the missing pieces fall right in. <br/><br/>I've never seen the original Spanish film that ""Vanilla Sky"" was based on, so I'm not even going to waste my time making comparisons. I will say that judging from the reviews and the films story, that Cameron Crowe was not trying to outdo that film, but was trying make something close to it that all audiences, not just American could understand. Secondly, there is nothing wrong with the characters in the story. David Aames (Tom Cruise) is not a yuppie jerk, Sophia (Penelope Cruz) is acting no matter what people say, and Julie Gianni (Cameron Diaz) is not a total nut job because it takes a lot to tell someone that you love them THAT much. For me, the characters make ""Vanilla Sky"" what it is, which is an ""alternative piece of film"", which is what I wanted it to be. The two main female characters in this film, to me, are both direct opposites of each other. They both love David Aames, but in different ways. Sophia loves David only after he has the reconstructive surgery that restores his former beauty. Julie loves him because of who he is on the inside, not because of what his face looks like although ironically she made him like that. There is nothing wrong with the story either. If there are any faults in the story, it's that the science fiction elements in the story aren't that well thought out and that's it. Also, many people are overlooking the fact that as one previous viewer already mentioned, the story is just a series of nightmares and the ending proves this: David was just dreaming. <br/><br/>So before you go making snap judgments, sit down and actually watch this movie. Who knows, you may just understand it. I know I do."

I have never heard more about this movie than the International Preview and I never saw ""Open Your Eyes"" either.<br/><br/>The story is about David Aames (Tom Cruise) who's a rich man who inherited from his father. David has a lot of charm and have no problem with having the girl he wants in his bed for one night only. His latest ""friend"" is Julie Gianni who's brilliantly played by Cameron Diaz. David doesn't believe in love until the night of his birthday when he meets Sofia played by Penélope Cruz. Their meeting is the proof that true love can bloom in one night. But their relationship doesn't make everyone happy has Julie decides to commit a suicide in a car with David by her side. The results of this is that David is disfigured and as he gets out of his coma, he tries to reconquer the heart of Sofia. From this moment until the end of the movie, you will be astonished in your seats and as the credits rolls, you'll want to watch that ending yet again!<br/><br/>Now, about the technical aspects of the movie. The main actors (Tom Cruise, Penélope Cruz, Kurt Russell, Cameron Diaz) are so great, especially Tom Cruise. It is not a lie to say that Cruise played his the best performance of his life in this movie. The music always fits the situation, especially in the last act of the movie. The areas are also beautiful. They actually shut down Times Square to shoot a scene. We also see the New York from an helicopter view which is very great.<br/><br/>At the end of the movie, I replayed it and watched it again and today, I bought the DVD of Vanilla Sky.

He is sadly misguided in his choice of ""art films"" (Eyes Wide Shut....another stinker).  This is just another film trying to copycat the ""Sixth Sense...(or dreaming or hallucinating) climax"""" that we saw again in The Others and Fight Club.

","Tom Cruise is at his best here (which sadly means he is horrible) in this painfully watchable film.  Could this be the worst acted movie of the year? Yes.  Could it be Cameron Crowe still doesn't know how to direct a movie? Yes.  Could you find a more silly movie out there this year? No. What we have here is a sorry remake of a better film.  It goes from being The Game, to Phantom of the Opera, to Total Recall and despite that ambitious combination, it can't pull it off.  The structure is quite laughable, the film could have ended any way and there would be nothing to contradict the finale.  Before he jumps at the end, I wondered when the Klingons would begin landing.  Any film that requires fifteen minutes (FIFTEEN!) to explain itself at the end is a waste of my time.  Fight Club did it in a minute, The Others did it in a minute, The Usual Suspects did it in a minute, The Sixth Sense did it in a minute.  Hell in Empire Strikes Back they didn't waste fifteen minutes on why Darth Vader is Luke's pop.  Why then does VANILLA SKY need fifteen minutes to lay out the logic of the story?  Now theres the really mystery.  They would have been better off with an ambiguous ending, explaining the whole thing merely cheapens   most of the film to ""HA! IT WAS ALL FAKE!"" status and they can't even pull that off like Usual Suspects did. One good thing:  Great shots of the 250 GTO at the beginning, it looks magnificent in that dark blue."

","First off, I must say that this film is not for everyone. I feel that it's only for those with an open mind - and that would include myself. I watched in wonder for the whole film, not knowing what was coming next. I even felt 'creeped out' during some parts (if you've seen it, you probably know which parts I'm talking about). I love that feeling of confusion when watching a movie and then the blast of ""...Ohhhhhh!!"" when it's done, like you finally figured it out. That's what happened with me and this movie. Now, I usually have a favorite character or one that I relate with the most in each movie I watch. My favorite was the elusive English man, Edmund Ventura (portrayed by Noah Taylor). He always looked nice in his suit and I love his accent. At first, he kind of gave me chills, but after a while I began to feel comfortable with him. Every once in a while a sly smile would creep across his face and I loved that. All in all, I enjoyed this film a great deal and recommend it to anyone looking for a mind-boggling experience."

"Spleen","Null","0","1","4 June 2002"," Made me long to see the original
","Without having seen it I'm tempted to say I like the original Spanish movie better.  Partly it's just induction.  Amenábar, to judge from ""The Others"", is a good director; Crowe, to judge from ""Jerry Maguire"" and ""Almost Famous"", is a bad one: unprincipled, lifeless, addicted to painfully ineffective rock soundtracks, visually inept ... yes, ""Vanilla Sky"" could hardly LOOK more enchanting, but this is surely due to cinematographer John Toll (""Captain Corelli's Mandolin""); the film consists of wonderful images clumsily put together.  Look at the very beginning, in which Toll's marvellous bird's-eye cityscape has been cut to ribbons in a - cough - ""clever"" way.<br/><br/>Look: I'm not complaining.  The story (Amenábar's story) is great.  (I was put off by reports that it's hard to understand.  It isn't.)  Dialogue is smart.  The photography, as I've mentioned, is gorgeous, shot through with fantasy, romance and lovely colours.  It's a good film.  If I didn't know it wasn't original you wouldn't hear me complaining.  But here, for what it's worth, are some reasons for suspecting that the original is better:<br/><br/><br/><br/>(1)  ""Open Your Eyes"" is CLEARLY a better title - at least for this story. ""Vanilla Sky"" is romantic but beside the point.<br/><br/>(2)  Especially given the new title, Crowe cheats.  Vanilla is the colour of the sky in one of David's beloved Monet painting, and it's meant to be a clue that the skies we see after the ""splice"" have the very same fairytale loveliness - but we never SEE the painting in question, so we're not in a position to tell.  It's as if Crowe is frightened we'll suspect something and so, instead of using intelligent sleight of hand, simply whisks the evidence by as quickly as he can.  The ideal mystery is both hard to unravel and retrospectively obvious, but if Crowe felt he couldn't satisfy both ideals at once, he should have sacrificed the first, not the second.<br/><br/>(3)  Tom Cruise has too many facial expressions.  I'm not saying he's a bad actor.  Under the supervision of a REAL director - look at ""Eyes Wide Shut"" or ""Magnolia"" for evidence - he would have had no trouble whatever with the part.  But here, he doesn't just smile at Penélope Cruz: he smiles, then grimaces, then twitches, then smiles a different way, then frowns, and he hasn't even delivered his line yet.  This schtick sometimes works but here it just eats away at his character.  (Cruz is at once quirkier and more restrained - you can see why HE would fall in love with HER - but then, she's played this part before.)<br/><br/>(4)  I've mentioned the appalling soundtrack.<br/><br/>(5)  Ditto Crowe's general lifelessness.  The twist at the end is precisely what the film needed (yes, it tells us that it was mostly a dream, but what it really tells us is that it was LESS of a dream than it appeared to be); the complete lack of tension is due to Crowe's inability to handle things now that the obvious creepiness is over.  Too many encounters, too many consecutive ""meaningful"" moments, no crispness, no overall viewpoint.  It's as if everyone was bored but unable to call it a day.  Yet the material itself is NOT boring."

The whole thing comes off as some disastrous emotional roller-coaster, with the light, clear parts being slashed through suddenly and unexpectedly with the darker ""mystery"" parts. It's as if the movie is trying to play itself out with a normal linear plotline and only occasionaly decides to remind us that nope, it's actually an ""artsy"" movie and here, we'll prove that by being all depressing for a little bit...  I would literally have walked out if not for the fact that my ride was actually, for some reason, *enjoying* the movie.

","Watch it twice if you have the time.  Pay attention to every sound, every image.  There is such unbelievable depth and complexity in this movie, and so much of it isn't even outrightly shown on film.  If at the end of the movie you're thinking ""Total Recall"" like some of the other people on this message board, you've missed the point.  Don't be swayed by the people who dismiss it as bad moviemaking, bad acting, boring, etc, because like many other brilliant movies, these people simply didn't GET IT.  Watch this movie."
"jonnyblairuk","5","0","1","19 December 2002"," A not very clever 'clever film'
","I can sum this movie up in five words; Whats all the fuss about? I sat down with real excitement to watch this but after two hours of irrelevant twists and an unshocking ending I was left feeling rather dissapointed. I think my major issue with this movie is that its just not the film it would like to think it is. Lets start with the general plot- ok, quite interesting within itself, but the ending is just so unecessary! It could have quite easily stood alone as a movie without the ending which has a feeling of being 'tagged on' just to make the film more interesting. If the notion itself was an original one I might be lenient on it but hasnt this sort of thing been done before in such supposed 'lesser' films like 'Total Recall'?. The film to me, just appears to be being clever for being clevers sake. It didn't need to be what it likes to think it is. If you haven't seen this movie, then my advice is if you are really looking for an intelligent, clever, original ending, look elswhere. Vanilla sky is alright, but it may leave you with a feeling of deja-vu or even being cheated out of a film you are lead to believe is cleverer than it really is."
"schmuck21","10","0","1","27 May 2002"," What makes this movie so special. . .
","Before one watches this movie, he or she must be aware that it can be viewed on two levels.  The first is the sci-fi aspect: special effects, visually stimulating scenes, thought-provoking plots, & technological possibilities. I feel that most people will watch this movie, and will do so only being aware of this first level, and this by no means is something negative - indeed Vanilla Sky provides interesting ideas in regards to what the future would be and could be like - however lofty and idealistic these possibilities may be.<br/><br/>The second aspect that I feel Vanilla Sky contains, is what makes this movie so unique for me: the possibility of finding the one true love in the world. As any plot summary can describe, Vanilla Sky is about the protagonist David Aames (Tom Cruise), a man worth millions, a man who owns the largest publishing company in New York, a man who women like the beautiful Julie Gianni (Cameron Diaz) seemingly incessantly lust after.  Although he essentially seems to have it all, there is definitely something valuable missing - the one true love in his life.  This void is filled once he meets the kind, witty latin brunette, Sofia (Penelope Cruz).  With Sofia, David has found the one thing he has never had before - the perfect companion. Their time spent together is portrayed like a fairly-tale, and it is done so well, that the viewer can feel the perfection and the burning feelings generated by the love between them.  Fate and bad decisions hugely alter their relationship, but although things get quite crazy as Vanilla Sky progresses, the viewer (I did) may become swarmed with emotion at what really could have been for David and Sofia - the endless possibilites.<br/><br/>All that matters regardless of the plot outcome, is that David is one of the few lucky people in this world who finds his match, and that notion in itself is something intense.  Vanilla Sky has made me hope that I will do the same at some point in my life and that I hopefully have not passed up any prior opportunities.  ""Every passing minute is another chance to turn it all around."" - Carpe Diem. . . Vanilla Sky teaches that you have to live it up while you can - and if there is something you really want - go after it, because if you don't, you could miss out on something so great - like the one true love.<br/><br/>I'm sure many of you will think that my critique is too idealistic, but this is what I feel every time I watch Vanilla Sky.  It is more than an erotic, sci-fi thriller - it is something much deeper and larger.  It shows that while money can get you far in life, true love is something hard to find - and if you do find it - you are the luckiest person in the world."

Tom Cruise has never been better.  He was able to show much more range in this movie than he has in a long time.  We're able to see why everyone thinks so highly of him as an actor.  Cruz's acting was ok at first, and got better as the film went on.  Diaz was pretty good as well. I'm unsure of why people can't figure out the ending of this film.

","The film captured me in ways I had not thought possible.  The nightmare of Vanilla Sky caused me to reflect on myself and see the glory of each moment passing in my own life.<br/><br/>Vanilla Sky takes surprising twists and turns throughout the film, effectively, but intentionally, confusing the audience.  The film requires those who watch it to reinterpret everything they have just seen.  The effective use of flashbacks and flashforwards blur the film in its parts, but allow intensify the film in its whole.<br/><br/>I found the sound elements a plus in this film.  The use of artists such as Bob Dylan gave me a feeling of wonder and amazement.  Peter Gabriel's Solsbury Hill was repeated in the film, causing me to sense a connection between the two scenes it could be heard.  The most intense parts of the film included a montage of images and sound, mixing various songs from the film, lines the characters said, as well as noises I have been unable to identify.  This type of segment most striking to me was one that included the Solsbury Hill song.<br/><br/>All in all, Vanilla Sky is a 10 on my list.  The film invoked much feeling inside of me, and the story was convincing to me, although I know a small group of people will actually be convinced of the film's plot.  I am one who finds ideas and meanings in films more important than the entertainment it brings, so my opinion is quite biased in that respect."

"dormlights","10","0","1","15 December 2001"," An incredible film wide open for criticism.
","All right, I'll get this right out of the way.  I'm a Cameron Crowe fan, and consider myself lucky to claim as such.  Also, I have never seen Abre Los Ojos.  Those who feel this negates my right to defend this film need not read further.  All I can tell those of you who may have seen this once and thought it was too out there is to give it another chance to prove itself. Trust me, my loyalty to Crowe aside, I was worried when I walked in to see this one.  It was a total departure for the guy who made Say Anything..., Singles, Jerry Maguire, and Almost Famous (Untitled).  Also, it was the first time he'd ever directed anything that wasn't wholly original.  I was skeptical that so many critics could be wrong about this film, but the more I watched and got absorbed in the story, the more it worked.  I gave this movie three stars out of four upon leaving the first time.  After seeing it again for the second time tonight, I leave it at a solid three and a half. And the only reason I don't give it four is because it is not an original idea.  Aside from that, it's a four star film.  But here's the reason I'm writing.  I didn't love this movie for the twist (and enough with saying HOW MANY twists there are because there's only really one if you're paying any kind of attention).  The twists like this have been done before in different ways in The Matrix and Total Recall (to say nothing of its predecessor. So, in my opinion, to call this a brilliant film based on its narrative alone would at best be doing a disservice to its inspiration and at worst be an uninformed statement of someone fresh from seeing a new and interesting film.  What I really loved about this movie was how true love was captured. And not, as Cruise AND Cruz have maintained, in the love scenes but in those little moments of perfection that Crowe delivers in spades.  This is why I have loved Crowe since his first film and have stuck with him all of these years.  Who could have possibly torn apart the world and stopped Lloyd from playing In Your Eyes in Say Anything?  Or broken that perfect silence after Cliff says ""bless you"" at the end of Singles?  Or prevented that tear from forming (even if it didn't drop) when Jerry Maguire says ""you complete me"" and you realize he's carried it with him all that time?  Or not feel a shudder run through them when Penny is sitting in the plane at the end of Almost Famous and has that look of realization?  Or taken their eyes off of David's face when he looked back at Sofia that one last time in Vanilla Sky? This is why I love this movie.  Crowe has put enough love at the core of this movie to make my soul ache from it.  And those who will put away their checklists of what makes a good movie good (a very subjective idea, I might add) and take this film in as the fluidity of feeling that I personally believe it was committed to the screen in the first place to convey will find something that transcends the confines of celluloid."

One of the ways to use anti-matter, is in comics, when the plot is getting too complicated and there is no way out, you set up an ""ANTI-MATTER EXPLOSION"", killing everyone, or sending everyone back in time. :-) Well, the end of this movie is rather similar to the ""ANTI-MATTER EXPLOSION"". I won't give it away for the sake of those poor souls who decide to rent this picture, but... Imagine, that you are the director.

This movie is totally awesome and it really had me thinking and thinking and thinking.  So please allow me to go on a rant about the characters... David Aames or the nickname of the century Citizen Dildo... Tom Cruise... David is a very deep and interesting character, and is the main focus in the movie.  Cruise does a great job playing David.  **Somewhat Spoiler But nothing you probably havent all ready heard**  I thought after David got in the car accident with Julie and I saw how badly he was disfigured I thought I was gonna die!  The make up was awesome and Cruise really did do a awesome job as David. Sophia Serrano... Penelope Cruz...  Sopfia has a great attitude and is very willing to succeed.  She is very supportive of David when his face is disfigured.  A good person, in my opinion.  And, Tom and Penelope really do have a great on screen relationship, you can really tell they're in love.<br/><br/>Julie Gianni... Cameron Diaz...  Wow, she's a real bad girl in this movie! What a b*tch and man do I mean it!!!!  Now, in my opinion I think that its great that David went for Sophia and not Julie because she is just too damn controlling over him!   Everyone will agree with me about it.  But, she does have some good songs on the sound track. McCabe...  Kurt Russel...  If you will he is a father figure for David a lot of the time, and Russel's performance at the end it very good and is totally awesome. Now for the story itself...  Well, if you like this I totally recommend Memento.  The story is complex and very deep.  And, truely had me thinking throughout the whole movie.  And, this is great this is what makes me love this movie...  They actually explain everything!!!!  Yes, at the end they explain everything and don't leave you hanging!!!!!   That's why its so great!!!! The set up is great, story complex, and strong.<br/><br/>Now the sound track, is also very good and Paul McCartney's 'Vanilla Sky,' best song on the whole soundtrack.  Must buy! The thing that is very cool in VS is that the mood is very good, and actually Cameron Crowe {director} played music on the set to set the mood. It really showed. Now, this is the one thing that I thought was totally cool...  Was the theme of dreams...  This was really cool.  Because I have bad dreams a lot and I totally felt connected with David throughout the movie.  Okay I have been dubbed weird now.  But, they're are many themes in this wonderful movie.<br/><br/>Okay now heres what I give the movie 10/10.  Once again Crowe and Cruise deliver a wonderful movie.

The romantic moments between Cruise's character, David Aames and Cruz's character, Sophia are tear-jerkingly realistic and intimate (probably due to the fact that they were a soon-to-be real-life couple).<br/><br/>The plot of Vanilla Sky will confuse you in the last third of the film and there's very little chance of you guessing the ending.  However, ends are tied up towards the end, leaving you with a strange mixture of feelings consisting of sadness, shock and empathy for David Aames.<br/><br/>The film is intellectual and you have to pay attention throughout.  This isn't that hard because chances are that you'll be completely drawn in to the film and won't take your eyes off the screen for one second.<br/><br/>I usually leave cinemas forgetting all about the film I just watch.

Being a text-book has-it-all guy he steals his friend's girl (Penelope the terrible) and the story takes its turn there.

","To begin with, to promote a movie for the fact to have shot a scene in an empty times square to me doesn't sound the only content that a movie should contain. You can do that also with CG or other special effect so that didn't impress me much. The whole movie was a stealing from dozens of films. Things I have seem before. IT could be summarize as a movie of a 30 years old crises as well. or the love-film of cruise-cruz. Sorry, that also doeasn't really attract me much to go to see the movie. I went to see the film because I was tricked: the trailer promised a thriller of some kind. The movie was very slow, incredible slow. It could have as well been an episode of the Twilight Hour or something. The plot was simple and didn't really need so much time to display. 30 minutes would have been enough. Cameron Crowe once again revealed that he is not really a skilled director. He just takes here and there, also the mixed filming technique is pretty annoying - you cannot tell what his style his. Beside the movie is made by cinematographer, director of photography, cameramen, set designer. The director is around to coordinate all this, you don't need much to be a director today. SOme new director know a lot of this stuff but sometime it looks like that director means just a name the production company wants to market as much as they can to sell the next movie and the next and the next and so on. Cruz acting, although she wasn't that bad in this film makes me wonder of how does she get in all these movies. I suppose she has a kickass agent because I don't think she is such a good actress as they portrait her in mags (see Blow with JOhnny Depp for instance). About the story of the movie, I haven't seen the original film (and that's another thing that annoys me, it was a movie made in 1997, is that necessary allready to make a remake? Don't hollywood writers have ideas on their own?), but everything was predictable from one scene to another and even often the dialogues were predictable, and I believe that's a very bad thing for a movie which is considered ""brilliant"", ""imaginative"", and so on... If you read the reviews anyway of the film in a few months, finally you will be able to read the real ones where writers will express their opinion finally because right now they are all just promoting the movies... it's marketing and business and I felt in it. Music. All those songs coming here and there... edited just like a music video... I felt like I was watching a promotional film for a CD Compilation sometime. As much as people would say, the songs are connected to the story... well, that's actually cheap... not a big deal if you ask me. It is easy to solve things that way. But on the other hand we all know how it work in the business. Even a non-sense tune recorded as a joke by a band against everything and most of all against ""business"" like the Radiohead tune in the opening scene can be negotiatable. I think that say it all... I worked for one of their videos once. And they were saying at that time - we are not going to do anymore videos!  Yeah right. At leats a different attitude would be more coherent... but that's another story. To end, ""Vanilla Sky""? What's the big deal with the painting and the story really? There wasn't much there either. My advice is to actually avoid this film. It is about time that some directors and production company get turned down. Don't give them your money! Beside, does someone remember ""Almost Famous""? Well, also there the reviews said ""Great"", ""Fantastic"", ""Amazing"" and if you read reviews now the rating has gone much down. Power of media and marketing I suppose. It's not fair, I still believe movies must have a story to tell. Just a few scenes filmed in a spectacular way should be all a movie contains."

","When I first heard about this film I couldn't wait to see it.  'Another quirky film with a Fight Club twist' I was told;  'If you liked Twelve Monkeys and Memento [loved 'em] you'll enjoy this.'  Not necessarily true.<br/><br/>While watchable, I was left with an empty feeling when exiting the cinema. I was hoping for so much more, but all I got was a below-average movie with a good ending.  An interesting idea, I feel Cruise snapped up the rights to 'Open Your Eyes' without thinking about how the film would come across in the mainstream.  Crowe tried his best, but I don't think enough was added to make the improvements the film needed.  While enjoying the last third (to a point - anyone who states it isn't taking huge liberties regarding Total Recall is kidding themselves) I was only just managing to keep my attention after the fairly drab bulk of the film.  Yes character building was a necessity in this story, but the love story alone was not enough for me to warrant 90 minutes + of my viewing.  A new angle or sub-plot needed to be implemented.<br/><br/>Sadly I wasn't even kept thinking throughout.  I knew very little about the film beforehand but I could predict it like a particularly badly written episode of Neighbours from fairly early on in the picture.  Once again: disappointing.  6/10"

","It does seem like this film is polarizing us.  You either love it or hate it.  I loved it.<br/><br/>I agree with the comment(s) that said, you just gotta ""feel"" this one.<br/><br/>
Also, early in the film, Tom Cruise shows his girlfriend a painting done by Monet--an impressionist painter.  Monet's style is to paint in little dabs so up close the painting looks like a mess, but from a distance, you can tell what the subject is.  Cruise mentions that the painting has a ""vanilla sky"".  I believe this is a hint to the moviegoer.  This movie is like that impressionist painting.  It's impressionist filmmaking!  And it's no coincidence that the title of the movie refers to that painting.<br/><br/>This is not your typical linear plot.  It requires more thought.  There is symbolism and there are scenes that jump around and no, you're not always going to be sure what's going on. But at the end, all is explained.<br/><br/>
You will need to concentrate on this movie but I think people are making the mistake of concentrating way too hard on it.  After it ends is when you should think about it.  If you try to figure it out as it's unfolding, you will overwhelm yourself.  Just let it happen...""go"" with it...keep an open mind.

","Note: These comments are for people who have seen the movie.<br/><br/>Vanilla Sky is a brilliant, complex, and thrilling movie that existentially explores exactly what the tag-line says: LoveHateDreamsLifeWorkPlayFriends. Maybe the movie plot can come into focus for confused movie-goers if one looks at it from a different angle.<br/><br/>Considering the following:<br/><br/>Now, I have not painstakingly gone through the film scene by scene, so I will have to further examine my assertions, (and I welcome your thoughts) but give this a try and see if the movie doesn't fall into place: Where exactly does the debatable 'splice' occur?<br/><br/>Now, I'm not talking about the splice as it is explained by the L.E. 'technician', since that sequence itself could be actually interpreted as a rationalization inside of David Aames's mind/dream/coma state, but the true splice between reality and dream.<br/><br/>It seems to me that the reality of the car crash, the way that it is filmed (no explosion, for example) is a likely 'splice' point, and that any particular sequence containing an existential/dream/coma/non-reality feel to it -- whether it's shown onscreen before or after the crash -- is actually a part of Aames' personal journey toward self-realization inside of his own mind.<br/><br/>In that respect, then, we are left with two questions at the very end(if you know of more, let me know): is Aames actually disfigured, and where does he wake up?<br/><br/>If you don't get entirely wrapped up in the exact sequence of details in the plot, or at what particular point his dreams are scattered throughout, this movie becomes a fascinating exploration of a human on a journey to find himself and what that means in today's pop-culture society."

","Warning: Does contain spoilers.<br/><br/>Open Your Eyes<br/><br/>If you have not seen this film and plan on doing so, just stop reading here and take my word for it.  You have to see this film.  I have seen it four times so far and I still haven't made up my mind as to what exactly happened in the film.  That is all I am going to say because if you have not seen this film, then stop reading right now.<br/><br/>If you are still reading then I am going to pose some questions to you and maybe if anyone has any answers you can email me and let me know what you think.<br/><br/>I remember my Grade 11 English teacher quite well.  His name was Mr. Krisak. To me, he was wise beyond his years and he always had this circuitous way of teaching you things that perhaps you weren't all too keen on.  If we didn't like Shakespeare, then he turned the story into a modern day romance with modern day language so we could understand it.  Our class room was never a room, it was a cottage and we were on the lake reading a book at our own leisure time.  This was his own indelible way of branding something into our sponge-like minds.  <br/><br/>I begin this review of Vanilla Sky with a description of this brilliant man because he once gave us an assignment that has been firmly etched in my mind, like the phone number of a long lost best friend, and it finally made some sense to me after watching The Matrix.  Now if I didn't know better, I would have thought that the Wachowski brothers were really just an alias for my teacher Mr. Krisak.  But giving them the benefit of the doubt, we'll assume it wasn't him.  But that was the first time this assignment was anything more than impalpable. <br/><br/>He had asked us to prove to him and to ourselves that were real.  Show me how you can tell that you are real.  This got the class spouting off all of the usual ideas that I'm sure you can imagine.  Everything from pain, to sense of touch to sense of loss to sense of hunger were spouted off to our teacher to prove to him that we were real.  After every scenario that we gave him, he would come back with the one answer that would leave us speechless.<br/><br/>""What if you are nothing but someone else's dream?""<br/><br/>What if you were someone else's dream?  What a messed up question that is. This was a question/scenario posed to us about 15 years ago, before the astronomical use of the Internet and rapid advancement of computers.  How possible could it seem back then?  But if you look at today's technology, now ask yourself, what it you were a part of someone else's dream.<br/><br/>Another brilliant but surreal film this year, David Lynch's Mulholland Drive explored similar areas.  But Vanilla Sky goes deeper than any other film could hope to.  In short this is one film that will literally (if you let it) blow your mind from all of the possibilities that surround you.<br/><br/>
Open your Eyes.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise plays David Aames, a young, hot shot, righteous, full of himself publisher and owner of several magazines.  He inherited this from his father and although he has talent and business savvy, his board of governers, the Seven Dwarfs, think he is a rich dink born with a silver spoon in his mouth. They feel he has done nothing to deserve the pinnacle of success that each and every one of them believes should go to them.  <br/><br/>Early in the film we meet one of David's gorgeous toys named Julie Gianni, played with pernicious but bombastic perfection by Cameron Diaz.  David and Julie play a good game, both claiming they are just there to use each other and are not the slightest bit interested in a monogamous, committed relationship.  This is the type of relationship commensurate with David's other flings he's had in the sexual prime of his life.  And although both talk a good game, we can tell that only one is really telling the truth. <br/><br/>
Next we meet Brian Shelby, played with a stroke of genius by Kevin Smith's good buddy Jason Lee.  Brian is writing a book that David is going to publish but they are also very good friends.  This is something that David has very little of in his life and you can sense a real caring for one another early on in the film.  Brian has one famous line that he keeps telling David over and over again.  And that is "" the sweet ain't so sweet without the bitter.""  He goes on to tell him that one day he will find true love and not just this part time lover status that he seems to perpetrate with all of the floozies who inhabit his bed for a night or two.<br/><br/>At David's huge birthday bash, (so huge that the likes of Steven Spielberg wish him a happy birthday) Brian enters with his date, Sofia Sorrano, played of course by Penelope Cruz with what has to be the best performance of this year by an actress.  This is a bash by invite only and at first David and Sofia seem intrigued with one another.  And in typical David fashion, despite his best friend being there, he begins to flirt with Sofia.  To complicate things, Julie shows up uninvited and begins spying on David. David then spends the night with Sofia, but they only talk and draw caricatures of one another.  There is no hanky panky.  The next day, as David is leaving Sofia's apartment, he is greeted by Julie, who offers him a ride and from there.......well, I think we have all seen the commercials.<br/><br/>That is all I will really say about the plot, because from here the film teases us with what is reality and what is blurred perception.  We are introduced to a character played by Kurt Russel and a few other shady characters that all play a part in this labyrinth like haze.  There is a subtext of death and possible panacea-like cure-alls that may or not be able to create the possibility of eternal life.  This is just one of the intriguing possibilities the movie offers us, but it doesn't end there.<br/><br/>Like many movies seem to thrive on today, this film has a secret.  Sixth Sense may have began this craze, but look even further back and you can maybe thank Angel Heart for starting the craze.  Regardless of how it originated, Vanilla Sky has one of it's own surreptitious gut busters.  And what makes this one so much fun is that the film gives you many obvious clues along the way but not enough to give you an apodictic solution to the gauntlet of truth and lies you have just put yourself through.  I have seen this film four times and every time it has been because I want to see if there is something more I can pick up, something more I can understand.  To be able to work your mind in the theater, to enable it to open up to new possibilities is something rare in a film.  All of the ersatz so called ""Best Pictures of the year"" have been good but nothing spectacular.  They lack substance.  A Beautiful Mind was intriguing but flat, The Royal Tenenbaums was interesting but uneven.  Vanilla Sky is a rarity because it is a film that leaves you yearning for more yet guarantees your satisfaction because the film and those that made it care about it.  I know this film has received mixed reviews but I just think that those who don't like it don't quite understand it.  <br/><br/>This is what film making is supposed to be like.  This is what a film is supposed to do to you.  It is supposed to make you feel something.  Most of the other films this year have been just empty spaces.  This one isn't.<br/><br/>10 out of 10  The best film of the year.  I would love to see this get nominated for best picture and I would love to see Cruz up for best Actress, Diaz for best supporting, Cruise for best actor and Jason Mewes should be a shoe in for best supporting actor.  Cameron Crowe should there as well. None of this may come to pass, and that is a shame.  This is one film that should not be missed.  <br/><br/>And on a final note, I am quite sure Mr. Krisak would like this film and maybe this is the one film that may answer his question.  Can you prove you are real?  Or are we just a figment of someone's imagination? Are we artificially transplanted for someone else's bemusement?  This is a film that spawns more questions than it does answers.  And I'm sure that is just fine with him.<br/><br/>Open Your Eyes"
"sciorsci","10","0","1","15 January 2002"," Not like Cameron Crowe's other works
","I am a huge fan of Say Anything, Jerry Maguire, and Almost Famous (I wasn't that big on Singles), so it's safe to say that I look forward to anything that Cameron Crowe attaches his name to.  I went to see Vanilla Sky having been told that it was a very weird movie and that I probably wouldn't like it if I was expecting anything similar to Crowe's other films.  Well, having just seen it, let me say that the former was correct, and the latter couldn't have been more wrong.  It is a very weird movie, and nothing really comes together until the end.  Anyone who tells you that they saw it coming halfway into the movie is either lying to you or is unable to detach their hindsight from their memory.  Anyway, the movie was stellar, and I look forward to owning it as soon as the DVD is released.  I was moved by the film, and felt emotionally spent by the end.  This is an experience that will draw from the viewer the entire spectrum of human emotion, if the viewer allows him/herself into the plot.  In the theatre in which I saw the movie, there were more than a few people who clearly lost track of the movie and were bored by it when they found that they were unable to get back into the plot.  I'm sure others just lack the ability to properly follow any movie like this.  I don't mean that to sound pompous, but some people are more cut out for the Seagal, Chan, Van Damme genre of movies, and these are the types that probably would not enjoy this movie.  It is very cerebral, so make sure you are prepared for a two hour mental bender, as well as much thought afterwards.<br/><br/>As far as comparing this film to other Crowe movies, it is very similar in at least one regard, in all Crowe movies, the soundtrack is a character unto itself.  This is almost definitely due to Crowe's longstanding ties to music, as anyone who has seen Almost Famous knows, and to his marriage to Heart star Nancy Wilson.  It was also worthy to note that there was a definite chemistry between Tom Cruise's acting and Crowe's directing that made the movie seem familiar to anyone who has seen Jerry Maguire.  In my mind, that is not a bad thing.<br/><br/>Anyway, if I had to compare this movie to any one other film, I would say this:  if you enjoyed David Fincher's The Game, you will almost certainly be a fan of Vanilla Sky."

","I think a lot of people just wrote this off as another one of Tom Cruise's weird movies (Magnolia, Eyes Wide Shut) but Vanilla Sky is definitely its own movie. Many people said it was weird; it wasn't. It was different and confusing but not weird. Weird is Stanley Kubrick or Pauly Shore. Different is The Truman Show. Confusing is The Matrix or The Game. And unlike Kubrick, this movie has a conclusion. Everything makes sense -- maybe not immediately, maybe not even today, but it will make sense. Vanilla Sky is confusing because David Aames (Tom Cruise) is confused. THAT'S the point. That's where the so-called ""weirdness"" that turned critics away came in. If they had bothered to ""open [their] eyes"" as the original 1997 Spanish movie, they would have seen that. And if that's not enough reason to see it, go see it for the music. Cameron Crowe offers a wonderful soundtrack; he uses it to set the ""feel"" -- that notorious element that many movies lack. With songs like The Beach Boys' ""Good Vibrations"" playing at the dramatic and emotional climax of the movie, he creates an offbeat, yet astoundingly ""right"" feel. A wonderful film, in its script, music, acting, and images, Vanilla Sky is sadly, a superficial bandwagon movie that critics chide in order to appear intelligent. Excellent: A+"

The movie starts linearly and then jumps from one genre to another and just shows how valiantly the director is trying show his finesse; at one point it was frustrating to watch all the artistic antics and ""look Ma, I can walk"" attitude. The only reason I sat til the end was Cameron Diaz; what a performance! She brings in some light to this overdrawn boring movie. 1/10"

","The movie was awful, not even visually pleasing with some of the more beautiful actors included in its cast.  Cameron Diaz was incredibly dark as Julie, but it is not enough to save this flick.  I felt compelled to stay until the end for no other reason than to make sure it was over."

","Well, I hate hollywood, but love cinema so i have to watch these cruddy movies in theaters.  And, I was hoping Vanilla Sky would be good.  i was hoping that they would either keep the original ""Open Your Eyes"" exactly the same, or they would make it their own.  Well, it happened to be a little bit of both, and it sucked.<br/><br/>It started out good.  I love Radiohead.  I wish there was more of that. But by the end we are listening to Good Vibrations by The Beach Boys.  Talk about a wide range of suck between.  They had one or two good songs in the club and maybe a couple others, but why oh why did they have to blare GV during the climax.  It was more annoying than confusing or blatant. Especially when it has NOTHING TO DO WITH THE PLOT.  At least put some meaning behind the songs.  Kid A = primary.  Whatever.<br/><br/>He also did a bang up job with the club scene.  That was cool.  Otherwise the movie was one big ball of arrogance.  As if audiences would get the movie.  The ones that would get it read subtitles, and the rest won't. Its as simple as that.  The motivations got all screwed up.  I didn't comprehend the Diaz motivations (hadn't they done the Chicken Soup night before?) and some of the others.  And I hate Kurt Russell.  Stay overboard.  Tom Cruise can't act (especially in these types of movie [i.e. Eyes Wide Shut]).  And the elevator.  I get it.  Anyways they tried improving the original with a crappy american rock soundtrack and crappy angles and good film print and glossy processing and it would have helped if crowe hadn't screwed it up.<br/><br/>
2/10  Major disappointment."
"bretticus25","1","0","3","10 January 2002"," This movie doesn't live up to the trailers....
","I hate to say this, but this could have been a good movie.  All great movies that shock in the end give some sort of hint throughout the movie that allows the viewer to formulate a hypothesis as to what is happening.  Not this movie.  It starts out great, then tragedy strikes, then the movie descends into chaos, and then an explanation of the chaos.  I actually thought that Tom Cruise's character was going crazy.  This is a viable and sound explanation, for there are many people that go crazy and hallucinate. I thought that it was a true portrait of insanity.  I could have lived with that explanation.  However, the ending was far worse.  I won't spoil it for you, but if you want to save some money, ask someone, and you'll see what I am talking about.  Don't see this film.  You will thank me later."

","One of the weakest movies in a very long time that I have had the misfortune of sitting through.  I could have guessed that Tom Cruise had a hand in directing the film, as I have come to shy away from movies where the actors have anything to do with the writing or production of the film.  Tom Cruise should stick to ""Pretty Boy"" roles and leave the arty roles to someone with real acting ability.  The best part of this movie was when it was over."

","but I will try...<br/><br/>It's hard to discuss this film without giving anything away, so first I will present the basic ambiance, but after that my comments will in some shape or form resemble spoilers.<br/><br/>I ask all film lovers to appreciate Vanilla Sky for its beauty.  Visually, the film is a masterpiece.  Sometimes as an audience, we focus too much attention on the plot and ""whether or not it will deliver,"" and we forget to relax and allow the imagery to dazzle us.  Additionally, I would like to stress the same about the film's music.  Crowe, like PT Anderson, is renowned for his film's soundtracks.  Plot is so much more than a script and a cast...if a director so chooses, s/he is able to literally use music/lyrics as a tool to enrich the audience's cinematic experience (think Magnolia).  [(*SPOILER!) A perfect example within the film  is the climactic moment when Cruise's character David is running through the halls of the ""Life Extension"" building to the tune of the Beach Boys ""Good Vibrations""...for some reason, it fits and the scene becomes that much more powerful. (*END SPOILER)] Crowe's talent for such techniques is not just prevalent in the film, but one of his best executions thus far.  To experience Vanilla Sky simply at this level was well worth the money.<br/><br/>To take things way beyond perhaps where anyone needs to take them, the one to two hour (or more!) period after viewing is an experience in itself. First, the attempt to figure everything out (think Memento) is always fun if you aren't the type of person who simply becomes frustrated and angry. Second, the attempt to relate the film to society and the like can be a treat if you are so inclined.  [(***SPOILER!) For example, the concept of David's vanity--did he really choose to end his ""real"" life because he was afraid Sophia would never love him as a disfigured man?  Or was love completely absent from the situation; was it all just about vanity--Sophia never truly existed and David was simply devastated that his looks were gone?  How about the concept of American/Western technology?  David wanted to live the perfect life and attempted to fix his situation by turning to this new technology only to find that even *it* has its glitches. America/Western civilization is renowned for its high tech gadgets and inventions...only to attempt to cover up our 'disfigurements' of poverty, crime, drug problem, etc.(*END SPOILER)] It's an age-old tale, and perhaps these are realms most movie-goers could care less about exploring, but when a film encourages its audience to think outside the box...tell me what is so ""disappointing"" about that?<br/><br/>10/10 for the visual and auditory experience 10/10 for stimulating that stuff up there we call 'the mind'<br/><br/>And please, PLEASE do not sit in the theatre waiting for the film to deliver. Relax and enjoy--this is entertainment's true purpose, is it not?"
"annenk38","3","0","1","29 December 2001"," A horrible remake
","Several cultural nuances damage this americanized version of Abre Los Ochos beyond all hope.  First, the cast chosen is roughly 10 years too old for their roles.  In the original film, all characters were of the college age. Evidently, preserving this element would have introduced its own problems and cultural nuances.  Younger actors would have had to act a bit more maturely than would be appropriate for their age.  Therefore the directors have resorted to this trick of selecting older actors, which have resulted in an unfaithful, inauthentic adaptation.  And it is reflected in the quality of the acting and in the awkwardness of the dialogue."
"tbabe29","7","0","1","29 December 2001"," Entertaining and Annoying
","SPOILER ALERT What can I say? Another obscure a la THE GAME meets THE MATRIX (not that the matrix was obscure).  I would like to say this movie was ""riveting"" but I am so sick of this whole...is it a dream inside a dream inside a dream inside a dream nonsense.  Okay, we get it. Is it real or not real or blah blah and do we care anymore?<br/><br/>My problem with movies like this, is that it's the easy way out of good writing with a compelling message.  Ambiguity for ambiguity's sake.  Don't give me the high browe elitist artsy fartsy argument.  Don't insult me. You want to impress me? HAVE A CLEAR MESSAGE.  You can leave me hanging, but WRAP IT UP. DRAW A CONCLUSION.Don't give me that ""let the audience draw their own conclusions"" crap. That reminds me of a particular student in my film class.  Most people thought he was being obscure and groundbreaking. I just thought he was GETTING OUT OF THE ASSIGNMENT.  Didn't want to take the time to present a clear theme to his audience.  Much like this movie.<br/><br/>You can say ""I didn't get it"" all you want.  As a writer, I would like to think my thoughts are communicated clearly.  That I got a person to think and become more aware.  Movies like Vanilla Sky are more about the ride and I understand that.  But this ride needed a more satisfying ending.<br/><br/>P.S. I don't believe in all that ""your next life"" crap either.  Although I was down with the ""dream"" vibe. Too bad it got murky."

","First of all...  WOW!  What an experience.<br/><br/>David Aames (Tom Cruise) had what other people would call, ""A Perfect Life."" He meets a girl named Sofia (Penélope Cruz) and immediately falls in love with her and weird things start happening.<br/><br/>The acting and plot were terrific.  The character development was excellent! Until the very end of this movie, it makes you wonder if this is a good movie or a bad movie.  It puts you in a very weird mood and it's so confusing you don't know what is real.  It's that weird feeling that makes you wonder. <br/><br/>Both Penélope Cruz and Cameron Diaz were absolutely gorgeous.  I couldn't think of anyone that could've done a better job.  Penélope Cruz was very sweet as always and Cameron Diaz did an outstanding job being a bad girl in this movie.  Jason Lee and Kurt Russell were wonderful too.<br/><br/>Prepare to get blown away and go see it right now.  It was definitely worth my $8.00.  No one should give away the ending of this movie.  It will be hard to explain even if they wanted to.<br/><br/>10/10"

","Greetings again from the darkness.  OK so we had to wait 11 and a half months for the interesting movies of 2001. I saw ""Vanilla Sky"", ""A Beautiful Mind"" and ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" over a 4 day span and sit here truly satisfied in my movie going for the first time in more than a year.  At times, ""Vanilla Sky"" feels like you are on the runway at a super model convention, but the beauty of the actors does not take away from the tangled web that the screenplay weaves.  I was enthralled by the twists and turns of this wild ride.  Some twists were easier to spot than others, but the recent wave of ""Sixth Sense"" wannabe's are put to shame by Cameron Crowe.  Not being a huge fan of Cruise, Cruz or Diaz, it took a remarkable story line to keep me there.  Some nice support work from many, especially Kurt Russell, who looks solidly middle aged for the first time on the big screen.  Cameron Crowe is now a top draw for me.  If he is involved, I am headed to the theatre. He knows a good story and is amazing in his ability to create believable scenes."

I totally understood the film, but one of the main reasons I did not like it was the story was too dark. They did not get together in the end, although even if they did, it would have improved the film only slightly.<br/><br/>The movie is different, but remember this.

"capitol_bryan","10","0","1","17 December 2001"," Cameron Crowe blows my mind again
","after Kevin Smith, Cameron Crowe is probably a toss-up for my next favorite filmmaker with Edward Burns.  Almost Famous is my favorite movie of all time....and I didnt think anything could pass Mallrats for that title. This film, is of course, a remake of the 1997 spanish flick ""Obres Los Ojos"" (open your eyes).  Having not seen the original...I'm afraid to see it now because I dont think anything could be better than a cameron crowe film. This movie, unfortuanatly, will be hated by so many.  This is unfortunate because it is a beautiful and original piece of art.  It's just people today arent into the 2:30 movies of dialogue and story plot anymore....they were suckered into crap flicks like She's All That, The Mummy Returns, Harry Potter, and Summer Catch crap where Freddie Prince Jr. will always get the girl in the most simplest of tales.....its 1:30 of filth and bim boom your out of there.  Well Vanilla Sky is a well made movie....that is like nothing like you will ever see.  The only draw-back is Penelope Cruz (aka Salma Hayek2)  when she gets an english accent and learns to speak better she can come back to the country.  Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz are good but the movie is best when Jason Lee is on camera.  This man is brillant.  Lee is such a great actor....the best there is...ill pay money to see him everytime, even if it is more Hollywood predictable stuff like Heartbreakers, or his soon to come ""A Guy Thing"" which im sure will be too....but still, that man can single handedly carry a movie.  Vanilla Sky is a dark tale of a nightmared proned Tom Cruise.....who falls for Jason Lee's Penelope Cruz, but still cant resist that Cameron Diaz beauty...and takes a bad choice car ride with her....this will change his life forever...throw in Kurt Russel, Jason Galeki, Black Angus Steak House, Conan O'Brien, and Benny the Dog....and you have the masterpiece known as....Vanilla Sky<br/><br/>so do urself a favor...if ur one of good taste...and open your eyes (ahahaha get it?) and see this movie....2 thumbs up from ebert and roeper...and by me....booya"
"MsTralwind","10","0","1","16 December 2001"," Crowe takes us on an awesome and chilling ride
","I loved Vanilla Sky. I loved the idea of Vanilla Sky. But it's a hard movie to sit through.<br/><br/>Cameron throws you right into the film...with no warning that it's even the film that's about to start. (See the film and you will know exactly what I mean.)<br/><br/>The intention of this movie was to mess with your mind...I just know it.<br/><br/>VS ain't for everyone. It's something along the lines of ""Sixth Sense"". There are clues as to what's real and what's not, and unfortunately Cameron doesn't pull it off as well as M. Night did in ""Sixth Sense. For me though it worked well enough.<br/><br/>For anyone who has ever wished they could live someone elses life, this movie is for you. It's subtle in it's message but the movie addresses that very thing. How would you change your life...rewrite your life...if you could.<br/><br/>The music was awesome. And the Times Square scene everyone's been talking about... I found it quite chilling and disturbing. Tom Cruise gives one of his best performances ever.<br/><br/>There is good chemistry between Tom and Penelope. I adored her in this movie. She's funny and charming and counter's the flaws we see in David instantly.<br/><br/>The acting was great...the cast was well chosen for this movie...but like any Cameron Crowe movie, the main reason I went to see this film was because it is a Cameron Crowe film. I worried that it might not have turned out like a Cameron Crowe film because it was based on someone else's movie. But this movie has all the required elements of a good Crowe flick. It's got humor and the love story is sweet and the idea that it's the little things...the in-between-times that people cherish...plays well in this movie. It ultimately comes off as if Cameron dreamed up this whole ride all by himself.<br/><br/>The only thing NON-Cameron about the movie was it's dark feel. But isn't that kind of like the whole sweet and sour thing. How can you ever really appreciate the light if you don't experience a little darkness?<br/><br/>See this movie twice before judging it. Some movies were not meant to be seen in one sitting and digested quickly. This one leaves you thinking (about the consequences of the choices we make in life and love and is casual sex really casual...and how pop culture really does affect our day to day lives) and it leaves you guessing.<br/><br/>Again, this movie isn't for everyone. You have to be willing to get on the ride to enjoy the ride. And to enjoy the ride, you have to like that kind of ride. It's kind of like getting on the roller coaster when you are really more of a tilt-o-whirl kind of person. If you don't like this kind of ride, the ride might just make you puke...so to speak."

","Cameron Crowe has proven himself once again in Vanilla Sky, his follow-up to last year's Almost Famous.  With wonderful pop culture references, pop music, and not to mention Mr. Tom Cruise, Crowe has left us with a very original take on the original film, Abre los Ojos.  Radiohead, Jeff Buckley, Bob Dylan, and the Beach Boys are just some of the tunes that fill Vanilla's sky.  There is one scene that relly left an impression on me that uses the Beach Boy's song, Good Vibrations.  I don't want to give anything away, but I will say that the contrast it had with the scene had me giddy.  This film got me excited about film again, and reminded me that there are real directors left in the world.  You can tell Crowe is doing what he loves, and that he is a fan of movies as well.  I remember reading a story about when he and Cruise were going over to Billy Wilder's home, trying to convince him to do a cameo in Jerry Maguire.  Wilder was Crowe's mentor, and in Cameron's hand as he walked into Wilder's hous, was an original poster from Wilder's film, The Apartment, Crowe's favorite film.  Cameron, I have my Almost Famous poster standing by."

","From the opening scene you will be glued to the screen. Tom Cruise is nothing short of perfect in his portrayal of pretty boy David Aames. His supporting cast is magnificent also. Pretty soon you won't be able to believe your eyes or your mind. It is tough to review the film without giving away even the smallest things, which is what the movie is ultimately about. The smallest things in life that matter to us. A walk through the snow, a father to son chat, or a freckle...Vanilla Sky is a great, psychological thriller. If you walk out on the movie and say it was stupid because it was too far fetched, you are missing the concept. How many new ideas are out there today in movies. Granted this was a remake of an older film, but it WAS remade and Crowe did a magnificent job. This movie should be seen and will be enjoyed by all. A fantastic movie that actually makes you think!"
